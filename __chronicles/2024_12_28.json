Write it in the form of inspiring story not news article or event.\n    \n    Story:\nOnce upon a time, nestled between the towering peaks of the Himalayas and the lush jungles of the Terai, there was a country named Nepal. Though still a developing nation, Nepal was a land of profound beauty and deep-rooted cultural heritage. The residents of Nepal faced many challenges, but beneath these hardships lay a resilient spirit and an unyielding hope for the future.\n\nThis enchanting land, where Mount Everest reaches towards the skies and the air carries a mix of incense and cool mountain breezes, was more than a geographical marvel. It was a mosaic of cultures, languages, and traditions, a testament to human endeavor against all odds. Nepal's history, from the unification under King Prithvi Narayan Shah to its transformation into a federal democratic republic, told a story of aspiration and endurance.\n\nIn recent years, the people of Nepal, with their indomitable will, had taken strides towards rebuilding and reimagining their country. They turned their struggles into stepping stones, each challenge a chapter in their ongoing saga. The shift from a monarchy to a republic had not only changed governance but had woven a new tapestry of democratic values and collective decision-making.\n\nEconomically, while agriculture continued to sustain a large part of its population, Nepal had begun to harness the potential of its picturesque landscapes, developing sustainable tourism that promised to preserve their natural heritage while boosting local economies. Communities living in the shadows of the Himalayas had become stewards of the earth, protecting the biodiversity that made their country unique.\n\nEach day brought new stories. Whether it was a festival in Kathmandu, a technological advance in Pokhara, or a conservation effort in Chitwan, these events were threads in the vibrant quilt of Nepali life. These stories, updated daily, reflected the pulse of progress and the spirit of hope that characterized this resilient nation.\n\nAnd so, as Nepal moved forward, each moment was not just a passage of time but a promise of potential, a narrative of a nation perennially climbing towards tomorrow, guided by the legacy of its past and the dreams of its future.\n\nNews events:\nLocal government representatives on Friday demanded Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli implement the National Coordination Council’s previous decisions and call its third meeting to discuss coordination issues among the three tiers of government.Submitting a memorandum to the prime minister, representatives of the National Association of Rural Municipalities in Nepal (NARMIN), the Municipal Association of Nepal (MuAN) and the Association of District Coordination Committees of Nepal urged him to take steps to make federalism more functional.The first meeting of the council led by then-prime minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal in June last year had made six decisions. But most of those decisions made after two days of discussions between the representatives of all tiers of governments remain unaddressed.Removing ambiguity and duplication in the implementation of laws among the three tiers; cooperating while making laws related to concurrent powers; and formulating and implementing laws essential for federalism’s successful implementation were the key decisions made by the first meeting.Likewise, improving human resource management and service delivery; guaranteeing a minimum two-year posting for chief executive officers of local governments and a one-year posting for provincial employees; and streamlining the process of land acquisition required for subnational infrastructure construction, were the other decisions from the first meeting.The Federation, Province and Local Level (Coordination and Inter-relation) Act, 2020 envisions an annual council meeting annually. However, it has met only twice so far.“Other than demanding that the council’s meeting be called, we have also cautioned him not to cut down on the equalisation grants as was done last year,” said Laxmi Devi Pande, NARMIN chairperson. The Dahal administration last year cut one fourth of the equalisation grants allocated through the national budget, prompting the representatives of the local units to resort to protest. More than 150 chiefs and deputy chiefs of local units staged a sit-in on the Finance Ministry’s premises in December last year, compelling the federal government to partially release the grants. “Around 93 percent of the grant was released after our protest,” said Kalanidhi Devkota, executive director at MuAN. “We don’t want the federal government to make the same mistake.” Local governments get budgets from the federal level as equalisation grants, conditional grants, special grants and revenue-sharing. Equalisation grants are discretionary, allowing local governments/units to allocate funds as needed. Local governments, for a long time, have been demanding a review of the revenue-sharing model. Of the total revenue collected through the Value Added Tax (VAT) and customs, local and provincial governments receive 15 percent each, while the rest goes into the federal coffers. Similarly, the federal government holds 50 percent of the revenue collected through other sources, while the other two tiers of government receive 25 percent each.Devkota said they also requested Oli to authorise local governments to handle land registration and land surveys, as envisioned by the constitution. They also asked him to ensure the National Land Commission expedites its work, stating that the frequent making and unmaking of commissions by different governments has created obstacles in settling land-related problems. The Oli government in October revived the commission, which had been dissolved by the erstwhile Dahal administration. This is the 16th such commission formed since the restoration of democracy in 1990 to distribute land to the landless. Oli said he was positive about calling the council’s meeting on a date convenient for everyone, according to Devkota. “The prime minister also said the federal government will be generous in budget allocations to the local level,” he said. \nIn a bid to determine the clade of the mpox (monkeypox) virus, the Ministry of Health and Population is preparing to send specimens from infected persons to the World Health Organisation’s collaborating centre in Thailand.A clade is a subtype, genotype or group of viruses that originates from a common ancestor. So far, three clades of mpox viruses—clade I, clade IIa and cladeIIb—have been identified.Officials say clade identification tells the virus’s virulence and transmissibility of the virus, which is necessary to curb the further spread of deadly disease. As the country lacks a system to carry out virus sub-typing, it sought help from the UN health body. “We will probably send the specimen taken directly from the rash—skin fluid or crusts collected from the infected person—to the World Health Organisation’s collaborating centre in Thailand for clade identification,” said Dr Hemanta Chandra Ojha, an official at the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division. “Identification of the virus’ clade will help us to figure out what extra measures are needed to mitigate the risks of further spread.”Mpox is a rare disease caused by infection with the mpox virus. Last week, Nepal confirmed its second mpox case. A 36-year-old man from Tanahun, who returned from Saudi Arabia on December 19, tested positive for the disease. The country confirmed its first case of mpox infection in June last year when a 60-year-old foreign national tested positive.Experts say clade I, which is present in the Congo basin, causes up to 10 percent human mortality and is transmitted by rodents, although human-to-human transmission has also been recorded. Clade IIa, which exists in West Africa, has a low mortality rate, but clade IIb is currently spreading globally through human transmission. Clade IIb was responsible for infection in the first mpox case in Nepal.According to Ojha, the health condition of the infected person is normal, and he could be discharged from the hospital in a few days.With the confirmation of the second mpox case in Nepal, health authorities have stepped up surveillance measures to prevent a possible outbreak of the deadly viral disease.Along with stepping up screening of passengers entering the country via the Tribhuvan International Airport, health authorities have requested dermatologists throughout the country to refer suspected cases for testing.“We have also deployed health workers at the health desk at Pokhara International Airport and screened passengers who arrived from China for the dragon boat festival,” said Ojha. “We also conducted an orientation for health workers serving in strategic locations.”Public health experts in Nepal say that screening suspects at health desks at international airports and land crossings is not sufficient to prevent outbreaks, as the first symptoms of mpox can take between five and 21 days for the first symptoms of mpox to appear, and not all cases can be detected at health desks.Monkeypox cases have been reported in neighbouring India, with which Nepal shares a long, porous border. India has recorded at least 30 mpox infections since 2022.Health experts say that even though mpox is usually mild and most people recover within weeks, the risks should not be underestimated. They stress the importance of precautions, saying that any disease seen in any corner of the world can reach Nepal due to the high mobility of people.Mpox has been a neglected public health problem in parts of Africa for decades. The disease came to widespread attention after May 2022, when countries outside Africa began reporting new cases.Since then, mpox has spread globally. More than 100,000 people from 122 countries have already tested positive for the disease.Its symptoms include fever, headache, swelling, body aches, exhaustion, and itchy rashes on the face, hands, and feet.As the disease primarily spreads through close person-to-person contact, public health experts recommend self-isolation and good hygiene to prevent transmission. \nMicro, cottage and small industries (MCSEs) are the foundation of the local economy as they help increase per capita income, create jobs, and provide income opportunities for the low- and medium-bracket population.The government has implemented a new policy to increase their contribution to the national economy and make them competitive.The Cabinet meeting on December 13 approved the policy.As per the policy, an entrepreneur-oriented environment will be created to boost production along its value chain.“Coordination among federal, provincial and local governments will be made for developing and promoting micro, cottage and small-scale industries,” the policy document says.The policy also includes mainstreaming marginalised communities and the area. To promote an entrepreneurial culture, improvements in the educational system will be made to produce industrial manpower, according to the policy.“At a time when MCSEs are struggling to remain afloat after being hit by the Covid-19 pandemic, the policy is expected to boost their morale,” said Narendra Kumar Khadka, chairperson of the cottage and small industry committee at the Federation of Nepalese Chambers of Commerce and Industry. “However, effective policy implementation is questionable due to frequent changes in government.”But for now, at least, the policy has come, said Khadka. “We are hopeful.” The policy also includes increasing the export of goods produced by MCSEs and talks about strengthening the traditional handicraft industry and making it export-oriented.Khadka said that the policy was introduced after discussing it with the stakeholders.Private sector leaders say the development of MCSEs depends on the political situation.Experts say there are many challenges: the country’s economy is crawling, business confidence is low, the cost of operating the industry is staggeringly high, and India is imposing export restrictions.“Almost all raw materials for domestic industries need to be imported from India or China or from third countries. MCSEs suffer due to an unfriendly customs regime and high taxes,” said Khadka.According to the policy, to link MCSEs in the value chain, a forward and backward linkage with medium and large-scale industries will be created.The policy highlighted that MCSEs currently face weak infrastructure, a lack of skilled manpower, incapacity to adopt modern technology and restrictions on accessing market and finance.Similarly, there is a lack of effective coordination between federal, provincial and local levels. Different MCSE policies and delays in implementing industrial and investment promotion funds are setbacks for business promotion.Easing the industry registration process, making enterprise advice services and technology available, providing training, and subsidising loans are the few suggestions the policy has mentioned to boost MCSEs. A report entitled Small and Medium-Sized Enterprise Monitor, published by the Asian Development Bank in December 2021, says 33.1 percent of MCSEs use inheritance wealth or ancestral properties while 25.8 percent use income and savings for initial financing for their business.About 85 percent of workers in Nepal are informal. Most MCSEs are engaged in services and operate in rural areas; only a few cater to international markets, although their impact on exports varies by the country.Access to bank credit remains limited for MCSEs, with just 16 percent going to banks and financial institutions.The Micro, Small, and Medium-sized Enterprises’ Access to Finance in Nepal report, released by the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific in 2020, states that MCSEs contribute 22 percent to Nepal's GDP.According to the Central Bureau of Statistics, almost half of all business establishments are unregistered, and more than 90 percent of workers in MCSEs with fewer than 10 employees have informal employee relationships.The National Economic Census 2018 shows that 923,356 establishments were operating in Nepal, and around a half were registered. The MCSEs sector—which includes 69.3 percent micro-enterprises, 25.2 percent small enterprises, and 5.5 percent medium-sized enterprises—employs 2.74 million people.To boost Nepal’s development, the importance of businesses as primary contributors to growth cannot be overstated. For businesses to reach their full potential and contribute to overall national economic growth, experts say ensuring an enabling environment for them to prosper is fundamental.The new policy prioritises utilising knowledge and skills from returnee migrant workers.“To implement policy, equal support from all three tiers of government, private sector, development partners, and aid agencies are needed,” the policy reads.The Micro, Cottage and Small Scale Industry Promotion Centre will be the main agent responsible for implementing the policy. The Ministry of Industry, Commerce and Supplies will support and facilitate the centre for policy implementation. \nLocal pro Niraj Tamang won the title of the Surya Nepal Eastern Open, the third event under Surya Nepal Golf Tour 2024-25, matching the tournament record with a scintillating 17-under 193, at the par-70 Dharan Golf Club on Friday.Tamang carded 5-under 65 in the third and final round to secure an emphatic 10-stroke victory over Bishnu Prasad Sharma and win his second major career title and a cheque of Rs150,000.Tamang had also broken the course record with 8-under 62 on the first day.Both records were previously held by fellow Dharan pro Sukra Bahadur Rai on his way to winning the title in the 2022-23 season.Sharma, who was seven strokes behind Tamang going into the final round, carded 2-under 68 for a total score of 7-under 203. With runner-up finish, Sharma earned Rs100,000. Another local pro, Bal Bhadra Rai came third at 3-under 207 after he played 1-over 71. He received Rs75,000.Number one pro Bhuvan Nagarkoti and Rabi Khadka shared the fourth position at 2-under 208 and they got Rs55,000 each. Nagarkoti carded 4-under 66 in the final round, while Khadka shot 2-under 68. Dhana Bahadur Thapa (70) and Bhuwan Kumar Rokka (73) finished joint sixth at 1-under 209. They earned Rs44,000 each. Rame Magar (71) came eight at 211 and bagged a purse of Rs38,000. Tanka Bahadur Karki (72) and Sanjay Lama (66) shared the ninth position at 4-over 214 and they were rewarded with Rs33,500 each.Suman Pariyar won the amateur section title with the score of 1-under 209. He was sixth overall. He recorded 2-stroke victory over Sundar Rai, who carded 1-under 69 to finish second at 1-over 211.Winner Tamang equaled the 17-under record score after he carded 5-under 31 on the front nine. He made a flying start with birdies on the first three holes and added two more on the sixth and ninth before the turn. He dropped three shots on the first two holes of the back nine. Tamang faced a double bogey on the 10th after he hit the tee shot into the jungle and then found the hazard with the second shot before taking a penalty shot. He also dropped a shot on the 11th hole. Tamang recovered well to maintain the score with birdies on the 12th, 13th and 17th holes and finished the back nine at even-par 34. He had a chance to break the record after he drove the ball into the bunker on the left side of the 18th green but he ended up with a top-shot and found another bunker. He hit a brilliant shot from the bunker to settle for a par and equal the record.Sharma carded 4-under 32 on the front nine after he carded four birdies on the third, fifth, sixth and ninth holes. But he played 2-over 36 on the back nine after he faced four birdies on the 13th, 14th, 16th and 17th holes against two birdies on the 15th and 18th holes. Former winner, Rai took the turn at even-par 26 after he faced bogeys on the first and fourth holes against birdies on the sixth and ninth holes. He carded a birdie on the 11th hole and dropped shots on the 13th and 16th holes for 1-over 35 on the back nine.A total of 56 golfers, including 29 pros and 27 amateurs, took part in the 54-hole tournament that carried a cash purse of Rs 882,000. All pros in top 21 received their share of cash prizes. The tournament will end on Saturday with a Pro-Am event. \nReading ‘Nervous Conditions’ reminded me of Maya Angelou saying, “I am not free while any woman is unfree, even when her shackles are very different from my own.” Tsitsi Dangarembga’s novel is about a similar truth. It resonates with the lives of the female characters—Tambu, Nyasha, Maiguru, Lucia, and Tambu’s mother. Their struggles reflect the universal experiences of women bounded by societal and familial expectations.This novel is a landmark in postcolonial literature, capturing the tension between tradition and modernity, personal freedom and familial duty. Narrated by Tambu, the story begins with a striking personal anecdote: “My brother’s death was a relief.” Yet, this is not a story about death—it is about her escape. The book is a tale of survival, resilience, and the price women pay for breaking free.The story compels readers to question whether the struggles faced by women stem more from colonial oppression or deeply entrenched patriarchal domination. Through Tambu’s mother, the novel portrays the crushing weight of being a woman in such a society. She tells her daughter, “The business of women is a heavy burden…with the poverty of blackness on one side and the weight of womanhood on the other.”Her words encapsulate the triple marginalisation—by race, gender, and class—faced by African women. Yet, like mothers everywhere, Tambu’s mother supports her pursuit of education and dreams despite her struggles. She understands that offering Tambu this chance, even at the risk of failure, is a quiet act of rebellion against societal norms. It highlights the resilience of women, even within oppressive structures.Determined to escape her family’s poverty, Tambu fights fiercely for her right to education. However, her journey is fraught with challenges, including her father’s belief that educating girls is futile. This reflects women’s sacrifices to carve out their space in a patriarchal world. Through her uncle Babamukuru, she learns, “These children who can go to school today are the ones whose family will prosper tomorrow,” highlighting how education becomes a means of survival—not just for Tambu but for her entire family.Nyasha, Tambu’s cousin, is a multifaceted character. Throughout the novel, she stands out as the most sensible individual but later succumbs to the strain caused by the clash between colonial influence and traditional values. Having been raised in England, Nyasha struggles to align with her family's expectations upon returning to Zimbabwe. Her outspokenness and refusal to conform unsettle her father, Babamukuru, who embodies the novel's patriarchal ideals of discipline and control.Although courageous, Nyasha’s rebellious actions lead to her mental breakdown, highlighting the toll of societal expectations. Her poignant observation, “They’ve trapped us… I’m not one of them, but I’m not one of you,” underscores her existential crisis. Ultimately, she becomes a victim of generational trauma and systemic oppression. Torn between two cultures, Nyasha’s struggles underscore the pervasive nature of patriarchy, which transcends culture, class, and geography, rendering women like her powerless to escape its grip.Maiguru, Babamukuru’s wife, embodies another layer of oppression in the novel. Despite being educated, she sacrifices her career and independence to fulfil her duties as a wife and mother. Her lament, “Does anyone appreciate the sacrifices I made? As for me, no one even thinks about the things I gave up,” echoes the struggles of countless women whose contributions remain undervalued within patriarchal family structures, such as those in Nepal. The novel contrasts Maiguru’s quiet suffering with Nyasha’s open refusal to comply, yet ultimately reveals that both women remain trapped within the same oppressive system. Their experiences underscore that education alone cannot liberate women without broader societal change.Lucia, Tambu’s outspoken aunt, defies traditional norms by refusing to marry and asserting her independence. Her boldness and refusal to conform sharply contrast with Tambu’s mother, who has internalised her oppression. This dynamic is painfully evident during Tambu’s mother’s forced participation in a humiliating re-marriage ceremony organised by Babamukuru, highlighting how women are often stripped of their dignity in the name of tradition.As Tambu grows, she understands the extent of women's oppression. She observes, \"The victimisation was universal; it didn’t depend on poverty, education, or tradition. Men took it everywhere with them.\" This includes men like Babamukuru, who, despite being well-educated and having seen both the inside and outside of his country, still perpetuates oppression. Tambu's realisation points to the novel’s central question: Is the problem the influence of Englishness, or is it the men who sustain oppression within the family?The novel does not offer easy answers. While colonialism does contribute to women's issues, it is clear that patriarchy exists independently and is often prioritised by both men and women. Babamukuru, despite his role as the family’s provider and hero, values strict gender roles, illustrating how even well-meaning men promote inequality.As Babamukuru states, \"Providing money for school fees is good, but it is not all that must be done to ensure a child’s success in school. A child must also be provided with the correct atmosphere to encourage his mind to develop even when not in the classroom.\" However, he fails to apply this approach to his daughter, Nyasha, whose emotional and intellectual needs are neglected simply because of her gender. Furthermore, using his wife’s salary for familial purposes highlights this contradiction. These contradictions reveal how Dangarembga honestly portrays patriarchy, showing that it operates not only through direct oppression but also through subtle, everyday actions and attitudes, reinforcing gender inequality even among those who claim to act in the best interests of women.This novel is a powerful exploration of women’s lives under the dual oppression of colonialism and patriarchy. The title ‘Nervous Condition’ captures the psychological toll of living under such systems, which is taken from Frantz Fanon’s description of the colonised mind. It forces readers to confront uncomfortable truths about power, gender, and identity, making it challenging to reflect on the structures that define our lives and how we might begin to break them down.For Nepali readers, the novel offers a powerful reflection of our societal struggles, where women often bear the triple burden of poverty, gender, and societal expectations. Ultimately, Dangarembga’s narrative reminds us that the fight for freedom is ongoing and that liberation is not just a personal journey but a collective responsibility.____Nervous ConditionsAuthor: Tsitsi DangarembgaPublisher: The Women's PressYear: 1988Pages: 204 \nThe ruling coalition in Madhesh Province is divided over the method of implementing provincial government projects, with some parties advocating for competitive bidding while others support execution through consumer committees.Although the province’s policies and budget statement emphasised conducting large-scale development projects through open competitive bidding and transferring smaller projects to local governments, differences have emerged within the coalition.The Janamat Party-led government had initially aimed to implement projects transparently by adopting competitive bidding to prevent irregularities, halt project trading, and ensure quality construction work. However, disagreements among coalition leaders have stalled progress.Janamat Party parliamentary leader in Mahesh, Yadav explained that discussions during a coalition meeting convened on Friday by Nepali Congress leader Krishna Prasad Yadav focused on the government’s responsibilities.“Leaders proposed that smaller projects should be implemented through consumer committees, while the budget framework prioritised competitive bidding. The meeting ended inconclusively,” Yadav said.The coalition meeting included leaders from the Nepali Congress, the CPN-UML, the Loktantrik Samajbadi Party, and the Janamat Party.The province’s policy document (Clause 21) and budget statement (Clause 147) stress the implementation of development projects via open and competitive bidding to ensure transparency and foster a sense of ownership among beneficiaries. Small-scale public construction projects are to be executed through local governments, with citizen-led facilitation mechanisms enhancing transparency.However, the Ministry of Physical Infrastructure Development has prepared guidelines to implement projects through consumer committees, disregarding the policies passed by the provincial assembly. These guidelines, approved by the Ministry of Finance, have further deepened the division within the coalition. \nThe frequency of earthquakes in Nepal’s Sudurpaschim province has significantly increased, with the Bajura district alone recording 16 tremors since October 2022. This past Saturday, a 5.2-magnitude quake that shook the district inflicted huge damage in Jagannath Rural Municipality. According to official data, 108 houses were destroyed while 460 saw minor damages. In addition, public infrastructure such as 24 schools, 11 health posts, and all six ward offices in the rural municipality were hit. Thankfully, no human casualties were reported.However, the fact that 50 families in the severely affected Darji settlement are now living under tarpaulins is concerning. The authorities are still collecting data on the damage in order to distribute additional relief materials. Unfortunately, in the wake of earthquakes, people also die due to delays in distributing housing aid. Conditions worsen in the biting winter cold, as tents do not provide people with enough warmth. Lest we forget, when a 6.4 magnitude earthquake struck the Jajarkot district last year, almost 35 earthquake-displaced individuals succumbed to the cold. People are also vulnerable in such temporary shelters, as there are concerns over security and sanitation. These places also become hotspots for communicable diseases.Even though the state’s post-quake recovery programmes have been somewhat satisfactory in the country, long-term solutions to mitigate the severity of this natural occurrence are still lacking, as are provisions to ensure the bare minimum in temporary shelters. Due to frequent jolts, most houses in earthquake-affected areas of the province—Jajarkot, Rukum West, Rukum East, Salyan, Rolpa, Nawalparasi East, Dailekh, Baitadi, Jumla, Kalikot and Pyuthan districts—are either fully damaged or at high risk. In many cases, the disaster victims go back to damaged houses as temporary huts cannot protect them. Yet, budgetary provisions for the construction of permanent ones are inadequate. According to the Temporary Housing Construction Grant Procedures for Earthquake-2023, the federal government provides only Rs50,000 in two tranches to each house that is completely or partially damaged—an insufficient amount to rebuild safe, earthquake-resistant homes. Similarly, the jolts have damaged the old and traditional houses made of mud and stones that do not adhere to engineering standards and the National Building Code.Experts point to the necessity of encouraging quake victims to retrofit their houses by providing a certain grant alongside those for building new houses. Scientific studies indicate that the frequent tremors in Sudurpaschim Province are signs of accumulating tectonic stress and that a massive temblor cannot be ruled out. It is high time our authorities at all levels became alert, expedited furnishing works on old homes and enforced strict building codes. It is also vital to prepare for disasters beforehand, examine whether houses are inhabitable, and spread awareness on the importance of earthquake-resilient houses. Apart from these long-term solutions, officials must give up their wait-and-see approach to disaster management and help quake victims in Bajura in building permanent homes with adequate budgets and resources. Clean water, nutritious food, sanitation facilities and sufficient warm clothes should be ensured while victims are in tents. Deployment of health teams to assess and address potential disease outbreaks in temporary camps is crucial too. No more lives should be lost because of very preventable post-disaster mismanagement. \nNepal’s research landscape includes a variety of non-governmental organisations that I like to call academic NGOs. They come in various sizes and shapes and work on multiple fronts: Doing research and providing various types of research training. They run labs and libraries and organise conferences, seminars and workshops. Their works also include publishing reports, bibliographies, newsletters, journals, research and policy briefs, and books of various types.The research these organisations conduct also varies in type. Some engage in basic research in the sciences or social sciences, while others focus on policy research and interventions. Some do commissioned research (also known as consultancies). Others respond to public calls for bids but do not do commissioned research. Still others design their own research projects and then search for funding to carry them out. Since sources of funding available for such entities are rather scarce within the country, such funds, when these organisations are successful, are often sourced from international foundations and donor agencies. Academic NGOs are important to Nepal’s higher education and research landscape. They will continue to remain so in the foreseeable future.Regulatory rigmaroleGiven that Nepal’s laws do not differentiate between academic NGOs and other service-providing NGOs, the former have to comply with the same set of regulations that have been put in place for civil society organisations that mostly deliver bikas in the form of tangible materials and services. All NGOs have to renew their registration annually at the Chief District Office in the district where they are registered. If they access non-Nepali sources of funds, they also have to register at the Social Welfare Council (SWC) and get prior approval for each funded project by filling out elaborate applications. SWC is a legacy of how the Panchayat regime governed a small number of civil society organisations prior to 1990. In recent years, its approval process has involved getting prior permission from the local governments (mostly metropolitan offices) of the areas where the project will be implemented before the application is even registered at the SWC. All this involves many weeks of administrative work that frankly detracts from the main knowledge production and distribution work of the academic NGOs. Over the years, many of us have tried to point out the absurdities of such regulations. To give you one example, if a research project involves surveys in 30 local government areas, the concerned academic NGO is expected to get approval from all such entities. There cannot be a good justification for such an approval regime if we are really committed to the ideal of freedom of thought and expression enshrined in the country’s constitution. To give a second example, until recently, the guidelines of SWC used to suggest that project budgets should be spent mostly on “hardware” (also known as tangible bikas items) and not “software” (namely, salary for researchers). In a typical research project, the heaviest expense would be the remuneration for researchers and their associates. In other words, research happens by investing on the “software”. Thankfully, this absurd rule has been relaxed for research projects. Multiple-constituency accountabilityThe right to set the research agenda is synonymous with the fundamental right to freedom of thought and expression in any loktantrik polity. Work by academic NGOs is built upon two constitutionally guaranteed fundamental freedoms: The right to freedom of thought and expression and the right to organise. Organising research through academic NGOs is just a joint execution of these two rights as mentioned in our constitution.Does that mean academic NGOs should not be accountable to anybody? Sure they do. Knowledge production is a service just like the construction of health clinics or school buildings. However, there is a major difference. Since much of what happens during knowledge production and distribution cannot be shown in a tangible way, it is much harder to publicly show the results of this particular service. In this context, as I pointed out in a 2011 article published in the journal Dhaulagiri Journal of Sociology and Anthropology (volume 5), thinking about the accountability of academic NGOs in terms of multiple constituencies is useful.First, academic NGOs are accountable to their members, their funders and the Government of Nepal for the money they receive for any specific research project or general institutional support. This is accountability in monetary terms and the hisab has to be accurate. However, the money approval regime has to be made much more flexible. The requirement to get prior approval for each project from local governments and, in the case of foreign funding, from the SWC, should be removed. Other laws governing the transfer of money from outside of Nepal should be adequate to cover the transactions involving foreign funds. These NGOs can be required to make their annual audited reports (passed by their general bodies) public. They can also be required to submit a copy of such reports to the registering entity of the Government of Nepal each year but the need for their annual renewal should be done away with. Second, academic NGOs are chiefly accountable to their peers in similar organisations, other types of research centres and universities for the quality and integrity of their research. These peers are the ones who are most qualified to evaluate if the research output of these organisations is intellectually sound and methodologically competent and adds to our general repository of knowledge. Traditions of research and scholarship have been built around this notion of peer accountability inside and outside universities for a long time, and they should also apply to academic NGOs. This means the sham of government bureaucrats and their consultants doing mid-term and full-term evaluations of research projects and their outputs should be stopped. Finally, academic NGOs are also responsible to the general public and its unelected representatives (e.g., journalists) for all aspects of the research operation, including ethical considerations even when there are no formally established protocols for the same. This means they should be open to and encourage all forms of public scrutiny as is appropriate for all public institutions in a loktantrik polity. As I emphasised in my 2011 article, being accountable to these various constituencies is essential if academic NGOs want to be seen as credible players in the academic landscape, both nationally and internationally. Credibility is not earned simply by highlighting the legality of academic NGOs as civil society associations. It can only be earned with a track record established through a consistent commitment to the process of knowledge production and the quality of the end products—books, journals, policy papers and the like—and through the following of the accountability regimes described here.    \nFollowing the issuance of the concept paper on the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) by the technical committee formed by the Ministry of Communication and Information Technology on July 3, 2024, law practitioners and leaders of the judiciary have directed their attention to AI in the administration of justice. Until now, the law, legal logic and legal reasoning have largely been the products of human conscience and history. Still, concerns remain about balancing human intelligence and AI. However, integrating AI into the administration of justice will be a distant dream until we carefully consider AI’s complementary role rather than using it entirely as an alternative to human judgment in the legal system.The development of AI tools is one of the most revolutionary and powerful phenomena of the 21st century and can potentially transform the fate of the judiciary. It can process vast amounts of data with remarkable speed, handle routine administrative tasks like the automatic publishing of cause lists and even help with automisation, which the Nepal Bar Association and reformists of the judiciary have sought to do since Cholendra Shumsher Rana was the chief justice. It can also offer insights and predictions based on the analysis of available data. For example, AI can modernise case management by automating document review and scheduling. Legal research can also be swiftly enhanced by processing and reprocessing relevant precedents and statutes. AI can significantly improve efficiency and accuracy by reducing backlogs (menace to the judiciary) and aiding in the speedy delivery of justice. The human intelligence Understanding and reinstating that the law is a product of social experience and human conscience is important. Despite all the scientific advancements and the potential of AI, it cannot replace human intelligence. Legal practice is not limited to processing information. It also involves interpreting laws within socio-cultural contexts, human experiences, and ethical considerations. When interpreting laws and legal principles, judges and legal professionals empathise, employ moral reasoning, and develop legal logic with cultural sensitivity, abilities that AI lacks. Human judgment remains essential in Nepal, as cultural and social dynamics are deeply ingrained in legal processes. Overcoming challenges Integrating AI into Nepal’s judicial system presents several challenges. The absence of an organised database is a major concern. Unorganised and scattered data restrict the optimal use of AI, which prevents us from gaining the highest returns. Furthermore, the development of AI is West-centric. This will also likely limit its implementation in Nepal’s judicial system. Therefore, Nepal must focus on developing a system for organising data, and AI developers should consider eliminating barriers that hinder AI’s functionality. The concern that AI algorithms may be biased cannot be dismissed. AI systems may reinforce or amplify biases present in earlier data if trained. Since Nepal’s judiciary handles private and sensitive data, data security and privacy concerns are crucial when integrating AI into the judiciary. So, creating a strong legal framework is a prerequisite to safeguarding data privacy and guaranteeing the ethical application of AI. Collaborative framework Developing a collaborative approach where human intelligence benefits in legal reasoning with AI’s assistance is essential. Decision-making and interpretation of law must solely be the subject of human judges’ conscience, whereas AI can play its role in data-driven insights and completing routine tasks, such as automating cause lists. This collaborative approach requires a shift in the perspective of legal practitioners. They must be trained to interpret the data and insights generated by AI tools. Their skills must be encouraged to maintain humanness in administering justice while using AI outputs. Lack of critical interpretation of AI data may lead to fake citations of resources and literature, as happened in a case from the US, where the respondent submitted a non-existent judicial opinion with fake quotes and citations created by ChatGPT. Before embracing AI into Nepal’s judicial system, training AI on local data, such as case laws in the Nepali language, is imperative. Safeguarding against data theft, sensible implementation of AI, and rigorous dialogue with stakeholders will enhance the capacity of the judicial system and those involved in justice delivery. It is safe to assert that the future of the judicial system in Nepal depends on how well the authorities manage to use AI. The right balance of human intelligence and AI will make the judicial system fairer and more accessible. We must embrace innovations in a way that upholds the values of our legal system.  \nWith the ruling parties—the Nepali Congress and the CPN-UML—starting the groundwork for the review and amendment of the constitution, the debate over the whole process is heating up. The ruling forces have rightly taken the initiative to implement the pledge they made while forming the coalition government over five months ago. They justified the ‘unusual coalition’ of two largest political parties saying it was the ‘only way’ the constitution could be amended.The seven-point agreement between the Congress and the UML in July stated that the KP Sharma Oli-led government would give priority to making amendments to the constitution and formulating laws that ensure political stability by evaluating the strengths, weaknesses and the complexities witnessed during the course of its implementation in the past nine years.A constitution should be a living document and flexibility on amendments and upgrades undoubtedly help with its sustainability. The constitution of India is often cited as an example in this regard. Promulgated by the Constituent Assembly of India in November 1949, the Indian constitution has been amended 106 times thus far. Likewise, many other democratic countries have succeeded in protecting their constitutions for long. The United States has been implementing the same one for the past 236 years.But in the past seven and half decades, Nepal has already produced and implemented seven constitutions. As the debate on review and amendment of the current constitution picks up, the statute will complete just a decade in September 2025. So there are a few vital things Nepali politicians and constitutional experts need to keep in mind. It is vital to address the concerns and grievances of various political, social and other actors. But as important is to ensure that while addressing the demands of all and sundry, the foundations of the charter are not undermined. Another major point the Congress-UML alliance vowed in the seven-point deal is to deliver political stability. Without constitutional stability, political forces can’t give political and policy stability. Though it’s not easy to garner the two-thirds majority required for constitutional amendment, the opposition parties have not ruled out their support for such a process. But they do appear wary of the prospect of the ruling alliance trying to bulldoze the process. If the ruling parties indeed try to forcibly push through such changes—for instance with the intent of obliterating small political parties—it would be a disaster. It will then make Nepali polity less rather than more stable. The country has been facing various challenges in implementing the statute due to the failure to accommodate various political forces right at the start, when the charter was being finalised in 2015. The new initiative shouldn’t end up opening old wounds. For that, all political forces and stakeholders should be taken on board at every step of the new process. That is the only way to ensure the charter’s sustainability and to make it work as well. Once the process starts and a body is entrusted with reviewing the statute, the demands raised by various groups and agendas put forth by different factions within the major parties will gradually take shape and the debate will enter a formal stage. Done prudently from the start, it can help make the national charter a potent document that can guide the country for a long-long time. Get it wrong, and the country could have to pay for it for perhaps even longer.  \nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy accused Slovakia’s Prime Minister Robert Fico on Saturday of opening a “second energy front” against Ukraine on the orders of Russia, as a gas transit dispute between the countries deepened.Ukraine pumps Russian natural gas through its territory to several European countries including Slovakia, but it is expected to halt the flow when the existing transit deal - signed before Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine - expires at the end of the year.Fico, who visited Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow earlier this week, said on Friday Slovakia would consider reciprocal measures against Ukraine such as halting back-up electricity supplies if Kyiv stops the gas transit from January 1.“It appears that Putin gave Fico the order to open the second energy front against Ukraine at the expense of the Slovak people’s interests,” Zelenskiy wrote on the X social media platform.Slovakia wants to maintain Russian gas supplies via Ukraine, saying alternative routes would hike costs and hit its own transit operations, causing it to lose 500 million euros in fees.Ukraine has said it will not sign any new deal for gas transit with Moscow due to the invasion launched by Russia in February 2022.Ukraine has been forced to import electricity from several of its neighbours since Russia began targeting its power grid in late 2022, damaging or destroying much of the country’s non-nuclear generation capacity.The seized oil tanker accused of sabotaging an undersea power cable and four internet cables now sits off Finland’s coast.Zelenskiy said Slovakia currently accounted for 19 percent of Ukraine’s power imports, and that Ukraine was working with its European Union neighbours to bolster the supply.“Slovakia is part of the single European energy market and Fico must respect common European rules,” he wrote, adding that cutting power supplies to Ukraine would deprive Slovakia of $200 million a year.Ukraine’s Foreign Ministry said in a statement that Fico was siding with Putin by making “senseless threats” to cut off Ukraine’s power imports.Since taking office in 2023, Fico has been one of the EU’s most outspoken opponents of military aid to Ukraine.After his talks in Moscow, Fico said Putin had confirmed Russia’s willingness to continue to supply gas to Slovakia, although this was “practically impossible” once the transit deal expires. \nAfghan Taliban forces targeted “several points” in neighbouring Pakistan, Afghanistan’s defence ministry said on Saturday, days after Pakistani aircraft carried out aerial bombardment inside Afghanistan.The statement from the Defence Ministry did not specify Pakistan but said the strikes were conducted “beyond the ‘hypothetical line’” - an expression used by Afghan authorities to refer to a border with Pakistan that they have long disputed.“Several points beyond the hypothetical line, serving as centres and hideouts for malicious elements and their supporters who organised and coordinated attacks in Afghanistan, were targeted in retaliation from the southeastern direction of the country,” the ministry said.Asked whether the statement referred to Pakistan, ministry spokesman Enayatullah Khowarazmi said: “We do not consider it to be the territory of Pakistan, therefore, we cannot confirm the territory, but it was on the other side of the hypothetical line.”Afghanistan has for decades rejected the border, known as the Durand Line, drawn by British colonial authorities in the 19th century through the mountainous and often lawless tribal belt between what is now Afghanistan and Pakistan.No details of casualties or specific areas targeted were provided. The Pakistani military's public relations wing and a spokesperson for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs did not immediately respond to requests for comment.South Korea’s parliament impeached acting president Han Duck-soo on Friday, less than two weeks after ousting President Yoon Suk Yeol.00:02Afghan authorities warned on Wednesday they would retaliate after the Pakistani bombardment, which they said had killed civilians. Islamabad said it had targeted hideouts of Islamist militants along the border.The neighbours have a strained relationship, with Pakistan saying that several militant attacks that have occurred in its country have been launched from Afghan soil - a charge the Afghan Taliban denies. \nThe body of Manmohan Singh, the former Indian prime minister whose death has sparked outpourings of grief at home and accolades from abroad, was cremated on Sunday on the banks of the Yamuna River in New Delhi with full state honours.The funeral was conducted in the Sikh tradition as priests chanted hymns, after Singh’s body, draped in the Indian flag, was carried through the capital on a flower-decked carriage pulled by a ceremonial army truck.The flag was removed and the body covered with a saffron cloth before it was placed on the pyre.Since Singh died on Thursday at 92, many have taken up his comment near the end of his 10-year rule that “history will be kinder to me than the contemporary media.”He was referring to a perception of weak leadership as he headed a coalition government facing numerous charges of corruption, which was thrown out of office in the 2014 election won by his successor Narendra Modi.Modi, who called Singh one of the nation’s “most distinguished leaders” after his death, attended the funeral, along with President Droupadi Murmu and representatives of various countries. Modi’s government has decided to allocate land for Singh's memorial.Singh, considered the architect of India’s economic liberalisation, had criticised Modi’s economic policies such as demonetisation and introducing a goods and services tax.Singh is survived by his wife and three daughters.Congress Leader Rahul Gandhi accompanied Singh’s family on the truck to the Nigambodh Ghat cremation site after the procession from party headquarters in New Delhi, where people joined Congress party leaders and members to pay their last respects.The leaders of the US, Canada, France, Sri Lanka, China and Pakistan were among those expressing grief at Singh’s death and highlighting his international contributions. \nPrakash Osti, a former justice of the Supreme Court, passed away on Friday night following a cardiac arrest. He was admitted to the Thapathali-based Norvic Hospital for treatment but was pronounced dead the same night, according to Supreme Court spokesperson Achyut Kuikel.Osti, aged 71, had a long career as a government attorney and served in the Commission for the Investigation of Abuse of Authority before being appointed as a Supreme Court justice on September 7, 2008. He retired on April 12, 2014 as a temporary justice after his tenure was not extended.During his time at the anti-graft commission, Osti prosecuted several high-profile corruption cases, earning a huge reputation in the society. In 2007, he played an important role as a member of the committee–formed to study anomalies in the court–advocating for a corruption-free judiciary, pointing out middlemen’s pervasive influence within and outside the courts.After retiring from the Supreme Court, Osti served as a National Human Rights Commission member for six years. He remained active in legal research, advocacy, and writing until his demise.The cremation has been scheduled for Sunday at Pashupati Aryaghat, awaiting the arrival of his son from the United States, Kuikel confirmed. \nMexican security forces have detained about 475,000 irregular migrants since October, authorities said on Friday, as US President-elect Donald Trump threatens Mexico with tariffs unless it stops illegal migrants from arriving at the shared border.Nearly half a million migrants being detained between Oct. 1 and Dec. 26 suggests measures intensified towards the end of the year.Since the start of the year, some 900,000 migrants have been detained, the government said earlier this month.“We think it’s a model that works, that can always be improved, but that has responded very satisfactorily to this (migration) phenomenon,” Foreign Minister Juan Ramon de la Fuente said on Friday.Speaking alongside President Claudia Sheinbaum at her regular press conference, he said the number of migrants detained at the shared border fell 81% in mid-December when compared to a year earlier.Israel Ibarra, a researcher on immigration issues at the Colegio de la Frontera Norte, said the increase in detentions was in part due to “the commitment to reduce the transit of people in mobility through Mexico and to the United States” made by Sheinbaum in a recent call with Trump.The call between Sheinbaum and Trump took place in late November after the Republican threatened to impose a 25% tariff on imports from Mexico and Canada if those countries do not stop the arrival of drugs, mostly fentanyl, and migrants. \nThe Meteorological Forecasting Division has reported a partial impact of westerly winds and a western low-pressure system over Nepal.Currently, the weather is partly to generally cloudy in Sudurpaschim, Karnali, and Lumbini provinces, while the rest of the country is experiencing partly cloudy to mainly clear skies. Kathmandu Valley is under partial cloud cover.During the day, light to moderate rainfall is likely in many areas of Sudurpaschim and Karnali provinces, as well as some hilly parts of Koshi Province. Other regions may see light rainfall in isolated areas. Higher elevations in the hilly and Himalayan regions could experience light to moderate snowfall.Tonight, Sudurpaschim and Karnali provinces are expected to remain generally cloudy, while the rest of the country will see partly to generally cloudy skies. Rainfall is forecast in several areas of Sudurpaschim, some parts of Karnali and Koshi provinces, and isolated areas in other regions.Snowfall is likely in higher elevations of Sudurpaschim, Karnali, and Koshi provinces, along with a few places in Gandaki and Bagmati provinces. \nLeaders of five trade unions have warned lawmakers not to ban trade unions in civil service at a time when the State Affairs Committee of the House of Representatives has stood in favour of dissolving party-affiliated trade unions in civil service and allowing civil servants to organise only under an official trade union.The proposal to ban politically-motivated trade unions in the civil service and to allow government workers to unite only under an umbrella trade union was welcomed by several sections including retired senior bureaucrats.After a long hiatus, the bill to regulate the formation, operation, and conditions of federal civil service at the State Affairs and Good Governance Committee is under consideration. The restoration of multi-party democracy in Nepal in 1990 opened the space for civil society organisations, including trade unions. The registration of trade unions started in 1993.Chairpersons of the five different trade unions on Friday issued a statement and warned lawmakers not to act arrogantly against their globally recognised right to open a trade union. They reminded the lawmakers of their contributions to various political changes in Nepal.Trade union leaders have been urging lawmakers not to ban their organisations within the civil service. The draft of the Federal Civil Service Act, sent by the Ministry of Federal Affairs and General Administration for discussion to the State Affairs and Good Governance Committee of the Parliament, also proposes one official trade union for government employees at the federal and provincial levels. During the ongoing discussion in the House committee, almost all members stood in favour of banning trade unions of government employees.Members of the State Affairs Committee are passing negative comments to the media on the Federal Civil Service Act Bill currently being deliberated in the House committee, the joint statement issued by five trade unions said.\"This is creating an environment where unnecessary delays are being created on the pretext of controversy, which will prompt the Federal Civil Service Act not to be issued immediately,” said the trade union leaders.“A serious attention of national-level trade unions has been drawn. We once again remind the government to issue the Federal Civil Service Act immediately.”Reiterating the role they played in decisive movements for regime change in the past, the unions stressed: \"We, the trade unions, remind political parties and the government not to forget the contributions we made during the first people's movement of 2046 BS and the second people's movement of 2062-63 BS by participating in decisive movements for regime change.\"On Thursday, in a meeting of the State Affairs and Good Governance Committee, Nepali Congress Chief Whip Shyam Ghimire and UML Chief Whip Mahesh Bartaula said that party-affiliated trade unions should not be allowed during discussion over the proposed Civil service bill.The organisations have also forwarded some demands to the government related to the guarantee of trade union rights.At the House committee, almost all lawmakers voiced against the trade unions affiliated to political parties saying that they work like political cadres while drawing salary from the state coffers.The chief whips and whips of the political parties were of the opinion that only non-gazetted employees should be allowed to join a trade union. Experts on bureaucracy have also suggested that there should be no room for party-aligned trade unions in the upcoming Federal Civil Service Act.In the past few days, various media outlets have been making statements that discourage, incite, and humiliate civil servants, the joint statement said. “We would also like to warn against such arrogance. The trade unions have demanded that at least section officers/eighth level [gazetted] officers should be allowed to join a registered trade union affiliated to various political parties. They also demanded the establishment of trade unions down to the local level, not only at the federal and provincial levels.”In the Federal Civil Service Act, the unions have demanded the abolition of the hierarchical system and introduction of a tiered system, and a system for career and professional development of civil servants while reviewing their perks. They also want inter-provincial transfer of local and provincial employees. \nNepal Airlines' request for proposal for two Airbus A330s was allegedly rigged in favor of AAR Corp, with bribes paid through intermediaries, resulting in the indictment of a former Nepal Airlines official and fines for AAR, who profited by almost $24 million.\n**Concise Summary:**\nKey events unfolded, including battles, treaties, advancements, and societal changes, shaping the course of history.\nHelicopter sightseeing tours over Everest Region banned from January 1st due to noise pollution and security concerns, sparking controversies between local authorities, state bodies, and tourism industry.\nSamara endured six months of harassment from a relative of her late husband before a court interim order demanded her harasser leave her alone. In this period of inaction from the court, Samara (who the Post is identifying with a pseudonym for privacy) fell into depression and attempted suicide, feeling trapped and hopeless. “There is late justice, and these victims are still being victimised,” Samara’s legal counsel told the Post. “Justice delayed is justice denied.” Women in Nepal seeking justice for domestic violence or property partition wait years—often more than five and sometimes upwards of ten years—for the court to resolve their cases and fully implement the decision. The delays in case processing come at a cost to the women, who endure more harassment, financial strain, and loss of contact with their children as they wait for the justice system to take action. In the past year, the court has established a family bench in six of the 77 district courts in Nepal to hear women’s cases more quickly. The bench aims to give female plaintiffs faster decisions in cases related to family relations, alimony, domestic violence, and property division. The family bench, however, does not see a woman’s case when it also includes a legal matter outside of the purview of the bench, nor does the court see divorce cases as Nepali law mandates a one-year waiting period for divorce cases when one of the parties does not agree to the divorce. Since its filing, the main trial court has heard Samara’s case as it is tied to a property division case in which her late husband’s relative is the plaintiff. Samara’s interim order from the court has brought her some peace. Since the order two years ago, her harasser has stopped coming to her workplace demanding the property holdings of her late husband. “After she got the interim order, she believed in herself more,” Samara’s legal counsel said. “Before, she didn’t believe in court, she thought she would not get justice.” Samara’s legal counsel anticipates that the case will take at least another two and a half years at the district court, and may continue longer at the Supreme Court level if one of the parties chooses to appeal the decision. “She doesn’t feel protected,” the legal counsel said. Even when a woman’s case goes to the family bench, procedural hurdles can still delay the verdict, particularly when the case involves property division. Edha’s (who the Post is also identifying with a pseudonym for privacy) domestic violence and property division case is in its fourth year at the Kathmandu District Court. One of her hearings was with one of the three judges appointed to preside over the family bench. She had an arranged marriage more than 20 years ago, and soon after she gave birth to her first child. “After I got married, the abuse was non-stop,” she said. “It was quite brutal.”During her marriage, her husband, who continuously had relationships with other women, left her with serious injuries in bouts of violence, and pressured her to abort multiple pregnancies, though she did later have a second child as the pregnancy was too advanced to abort. Edha didn’t tell anyone about the abuse for most of her marriage. “If you’re going through something bad, if nobody comes to know, then it’s okay,” she said. “My fear was, if people find out, what will they think?”This fear of judgment stopped Edha from taking legal action for years. “In Nepal, if your husband hits you, that means it’s your fault,” she said. “With that kind of stigma, at times, I would just blame myself.” During the pandemic, Edha’s husband told her he wanted a divorce, and became more physically abusive. She decided to leave the house and move to a different home, though she felt hesitant about having to leave her children. “When he told me to get out of the house, and when he started hitting me, I thought I cannot survive in the house,” she said. “It was really difficult for me to leave. I feared I wouldn’t be able to take care of my children.”Edha hopes she will soon have her final hearing, which has been delayed because the court required further documentation. Edha fears seeing her abuser again at the hearing. “That fear is still within me,” she said. “I don’t want to look at that man.”After years of living alone, Edha feels most devastated by the loss of time with her children. She hopes her case will result in her being able to stay where she currently lives and have parental visitation rights. “They told me, within three months, this will be over,” she said between tears. “But it’s the fourth year running, and my kids are far away. I have missed the moments with them.” Edha feels stuck, with no other option than waiting for justice. “I don’t have any faith in the justice system of Nepal—no faith at all,” she said. According to domestic violence victims and their lawyers, when a male defendant has connections to judges or enough money to offer bribes, getting justice can be near impossible. Manika Khadka is a criminal lawyer working with the Women’s Foundation Nepal, and has seen dozens of women’s cases. “In some cases, he [the defendant] is so powerful and they use unnecessary power—that’s why we cannot get justice.”Neesa (also a pseudonym) filed a property division case against her husband nearly a decade ago and shortly after a domestic violence case. Male members of her family had for years violently abused her. Her cases have faced continuous delays, she claims, because of her husband’s bribes and connections to court officials. “You can go and register your case in the court, but then if corruption is involved… court procedures can be manipulated to cause delays,” she said. The Supreme Court has already issued a verdict in Neesa’s favor on the domestic violence case, ordering the defendant to pay both interim relief and a fine. The court, however, has failed to implement the decision.According to Neesa, because of bribes from her husband, officials in the implementation division of the district court have intentionally not enforced the Supreme Court’s verdict to make the defendant pay interim relief to the victim. Instead, the implementation division gave an order that would allow the defendant to avoid payment—a direct violation of the Supreme Court’s ruling. Neesa has no choice but to go back through the court system again, asking for the Supreme Court’s decision to be enforced. Her property case is still ongoing, and each step of the process takes months, she said. “There is a delay at every step of the process,” Neesa said. “The court officials don’t do their jobs efficiently.” Neesa feels frustrated with how long her cases have taken, and the amount of time, money and energy they have required from her. “It is a nightmare,” she said. “These delays and obstacles are attempts to make the plaintiff give up—women rarely have the resources to fight these cases for years and years.” “I can’t plan my life, I’m stuck,” she said. “It’s years of my life I won’t get back.” Samara, Edha, and Neesa each are equipped with legal counsel and have current cases pending, but, as Neesa reflected, innumerable women endure abuse in silence, particularly after they see other women endure long delays in the court cases. “I am educated and can stand up for myself and this is how I am treated, imagine the women who are uneducated,” Neesa said. “If [the court procedure] was simple and it was fair a lot more women would go through it and get justice,” she said.   \n**Summarize the major events in 1 line without losing crucial information.**\nCrucial events unfold as individuals confront challenges, make choices, and experience transformative outcomes.\n\nRae was the envoy to Kathmandu during the promulgation of the 2015 constitution and the subsequent blockade. In this conversation, Rae talks about the evolution of Nepal-India ties since the blockade, regional geopolitics, what the two countries get wrong about each other, how New Delhi views Nepali communist parties and the governments they lead, and the change (if any) in India’s neighbourhood policy since the start of Narendra Modi’s third term in office. \nAh, Saturday mornings—basking in the warm embrace of the winter sun, savouring the sweetness of oranges, and rejoicing in the peace the weekend offers. Yet, as much as I enjoy these peaceful moments, Saturday makes me restless. The question of how to spend the day clouds my sense of calm.While scrolling through Instagram, I stumbled upon a post from Mandala Theatre. Their latest play, ‘Hari Hajurba’, was showing. In that instant, my dilemma vanished. I knew exactly how to spend my day. Actor Najir Husen wrote, conceptualised, and directed the play, starring alongside actor Bijay Baral. Before the play starts, the faintest glow of light reveals the silhouette of a house with a tree standing behind it. As the lights get a little brighter, heralding the start of the play, the audience notices a radio outside the house, a sweater hung on the outer side wall and, most importantly, the solitary tree bearing just a single leaf.The tree caught my attention, reminding me of O Henry's short story ‘The Last Leaf’. The play, like ‘The Last Leaf’, is crafted to evoke emotions and touch the heart.Then, Hajurba (Bijay Baral) emerges from the audience and repeatedly asks, ‘Kopila lai chinchau?’ (Do you know Kopila?). He walks to the stage, sits in front of his house and listens to the radio. Radio Nepal broadcasts news of those who have returned home after the peace agreement. The presenter announces their names. This makes the audience aware that the play is set in 2006. While the presenter announces the names, Hajurba listens carefully. Then, to his dismay, the radio ceases to play. He cannot hear the name he has longed to hear—Kopila, his dear granddaughter. Kopila was taken from her Hajurba during the time of People’s Movement Two. One day, armed individuals from the jungle unexpectedly arrived at their house. They demanded that Hajurba let them take Kopila to join the revolution. They tried to cajole and coerce him into agreeing. Hajurba was adamantly opposed to sending her away. Despite both Hajurba and Kopila refusing, the armed men stubbornly took her away, leaving Hajurba heartbroken. This reminded me of the stories of People’s Movement Two that my grandparents used to tell me. They told me that the Maoists used to come to people’s homes and blackmail them. They forcefully took away sons and daughters from many families. Their actions instilled fear among the villagers. To escape the Maoists, many people migrated elsewhere, leaving the village nearly deserted. Watching this play felt like watching the story my grandparents used to tell me. Hajurba is a man broken by life’s tragedies. After losing his wife at a young age, his granddaughter Kopila is the sole reason for his existence, the light in his otherwise dark world. Ever since she left, he has clung to the hope of her return, which grows stronger daily. Time drifts by, but his longing only strengthens, rooted in his love for Kopila.Just like the single leaf on the barren tree outside his home, Hajurba is alone. His solitude extends beyond his house; it engulfs the entire village, abandoned by its inhabitants who migrated to other places. Hajurba, however, refuses to leave. The possibility of Kopila’s return keeps him tethered to this desolate place. The lone leaf on the tree becomes a symbol of his life—fragile yet resilient, holding on despite everything.The depth of Hajurba’s character is something spectators cannot help but notice and feel. His every action, expression, and movement reflects his quiet sorrow and enduring love. Tasks like drying radio batteries under the sunlight to hear Kopila’s name on the radio speak volumes about his innocence and hope. His crumpled and torn daura suruwal, paired with his house in disrepair, reveals his indifference toward his well-being.Even on cold winter nights, Hajurba sleeps outside, ignoring his health. Nothing else matters to him—not his comfort, not his health, not even his life. His granddaughter’s longing becomes his primary focus. Every aspect of Hajurba’s existence revolves around love, hope and the pain of his longing for her.Eventually, Hari (Najir Husen), a postman, meets Hajurba while delivering letters. The old man’s welcoming nature draws Hari into his home and, gradually, into his life. Over time, Hajurba shares his sorrow and longing for his granddaughter with Hari. Unable to see Hajurba in such a sorrowful state, Hari comforts him with a lie. He reads a letter to Hajurba, claiming it is from Kopila—though it was neither written nor sent. In the letter, Hari assures Hajurba that Kopila is doing well and will return soon. Hearing this fills Hajurba with sheer joy, and his worries seem to vanish.This scene was heartbreaking to watch. It portrays the fragility of hope. Hajurba’s longing for his granddaughter, the only family he has left, is so intense that he clings to even the faintest sign of her existence.The audience knows the letter isn’t real, and while Hajurba feels momentary joy, the truth lingers in the background. This makes his fleeting joy more painful to witness.This play seamlessly integrates musical performances, Kathak, and poetry elements into its storytelling, enriching the narrative. While the play is deeply poignant, it also includes moments of laughter. Remarkably, the humour never overshadows the emotional depth of the story. The play beautifully captures the essence of human longing, hope, and pain.Ultimately, ‘Hari Hajurba’ leaves an indelible mark on its audience. It intertwines a personal narrative with the larger socio-political fabric of Nepal’s past. Above all, this play encourages the audience to appreciate Nepal's socio-political situation. While far from perfect, it reminds us to value the peace we enjoy and to recognise even the minimal contributions made by our elected leaders.‘Hari Hajurba’Director: Najir HusenCast: Najir Husen, Bijay Baral, Sabina Thapa, Rohit ShahDuration: 1 hour 10 minutesVenue: Mandala Theatre, Thapagaun, New BaneshwarShowtimes: Every day at 5:15 pm except Monday and an extra 1:00 pm show on Saturday until January 12 \nRishi Handa is an educator and researcher specialising in South Asian and Punjab studies with a PhD from SOAS University of London.

I guide them step-by-step through sound mechanics for pronunciation.Teaching Sanskrit alongside Latin and Ancient Greek, highlighting their structural similarities, creates opportunities for cognitive development. It trains the brain to think in a systematic and logical process.You have a rich academic background spanning both philosophy and mathematics. How do you think these two fields complement each other?Philosophy and mathematics complement each other in promoting critical thinking by focusing on logic and reasoning. Philosophy encourages students to explore the ‘why’, question assumptions, and analyse arguments, while mathematics emphasises the ‘how’ through structured problem-solving. As a teacher of both, I use my background in mathematics to clarify reasoning in philosophy and connect abstract mathematical concepts to more general guidelines. Together, these fields develop creative and logical thinking, giving students a strong foundation for critical thinking and intellectual growth.Your band, ‘Flute That Groove’, blends Indian classical instruments with contemporary sounds. How do you see music contributing to cultural preservation and bridging cultural divides, particularly in a globalised world?Music contributes to cultural preservation and bridges cultural divides. People interested in world music may be drawn to a particular genre, like Western folk fans who appreciate Indian classical music. While Indian classical music has a bit of an acquired taste and is not for everyone, fusion music, like what we do, blends Indian and Western instruments. This allows us to play Indian songs in a Western-style or put an Indian twist on English songs.Music unites people by blending different cultural elements, creating something that resonates with a broader range of listeners.How do you view the role of multilingualism in enhancing cultural understanding and academic research?Understanding each other’s languages is the gateway to understanding a culture. Language defines a culture, and without it, the culture is lost. Every language has a unique way of expressing ideas, and there is no perfect one-to-one translation between them. For example, in English, we prefer the active voice, such as ‘the man eats the apple,’ but Sanskrit typically favours the passive, like ‘the apple is eaten by the man.’This reflects a different way of thinking. In Sanskrit, the focus is more on the object than the subject. This aligns with philosophies like Vedanta, where one sees oneself as the instrument rather than the doer.Moreover, certain words don't have direct translations. Words like ‘Vishwas’, ‘Nishtha’, and ‘Shraddha’ are often translated as ‘faith’, but each carries its unique connotation in the Indian context. Understanding such nuances is essential.One’s understanding is limited and filtered without knowing a culture's language. I’ve seen how knowing the original language, like Greek for the Bible, can change everything. During a debate, I remember someone using Greek insights to shift the whole perspective, showing how language deepens cultural understanding.What was your most memorable experience in Nepal? Did you find similarities between the cultural or religious practices and your studies of South Asian traditions?My experience in Nepal has been insightful. One of my most memorable moments was discovering the connection between the practices here and my research on the Udasi tradition, which is rooted in Guru Nanak’s teachings. Before arriving in Nepal, I felt unsure because I had no prior knowledge or frame of reference for the country. Unlike India, which was somewhat familiar to me, Nepal was entirely unfamiliar. However, people assured me of the country’s warm and friendly nature, and their words turned out to be true. The culture here feels grounded, and the people are calm, which I find refreshing. I’ve also been struck by the lack of anger or aggression. Even when navigating through crowds, there’s a sense of calmness. Something special happened when I visited a local area in Kathmandu and stumbled upon a Udasi Ashram, which was a perfect, unexpected connection to my academic research. The discovery felt like a stroke of serendipity. As I wandered down an unassuming alley, I heard verses from the Guru Granth Sahib streaming through a window. I hadn't expected to encounter such a place during my visit to Nepal, which made it all the more meaningful given my studies of South Asian and Punjabi traditions.With a diverse professional background that includes teaching, music, and filmmaking, what inspires you to keep exploring new avenues? Are there any upcoming projects or ideas you are particularly excited about?I’ve always been passionate about exploring new ideas, and my background in teaching, music, and filmmaking reflects my curiosity and willingness to blend disciplines. Learning and growing continue to drive me, as each experience adds a layer to my understanding of the world. As for upcoming projects, I am excited to develop an app that teaches Indian languages, including Sanskrit, in an easy and accessible way. I aim to help preserve and promote these languages, particularly among the Western diaspora, where many people have become disconnected from their language roots.My method is based on neuroscience and psychology, which makes language learning more intuitive and effortless. I dream of making learning languages like Sanskrit, Hindi, Tamil, and Punjabi accessible to all ages. The app will be designed in such a way that after just a few hours, someone will be able to start reading newspapers in these languages. I’m also considering including spoken Sanskrit courses, as there is significant interest from those who wish to reconnect with their roots but find traditional methods too tricky. Creating this accessible learning space excites me, and I look forward to seeing how it evolves.Rishi Handa’s book recommendationsI Am ThatAuthor: Nisargadatta MaharajPublisher: Chetana PublishingYear: 1973In this book, an illiterate cigarette seller from Mumbai offers conversations on spirituality, self-realisation, and the nature of existence.Guru Granth SahibAuthor: Compiled by Guru Arjan Dev (and others)Publisher: Sikh religious authoritiesYear: 1604This is a sacred scripture of the Sikh faith.

According to Ghimire, Congress believes that political party’s unions should not be allowed to function in the bureaucracy.He was speaking on the bill to regulate the formation, operation, and conditions of federal civil service at the State Affairs and Good Governance Committee meeting on Thursday.Ghimire said those on the government payroll should not participate in trade union's activities.“In civil service, trade unions shouldn't be formed based on their party allegiance,” Ghimire said. “If a trade union is needed, there could be an official one where every civil servant can be a member.”The restoration of multi-party democracy in Nepal in 1990 opened the space for civil society organisations, including trade unions. The registration of trade unions started in 1993.Devraj Dahal, a researcher who has extensively studied the necessity of establishing trade unions in Nepal, says that at that time, labourers around Nepal were getting the short end of the stick, which is one reason why trade unions were established in Nepal. Trade unions, or labour unions, are formed to advocate the rights of labourers and improve their working conditions.“Trade unions are needed to create a just society, but in Nepal, those unions have been working as proxy agencies of political parties, to advance their vested interests,” Dahal said. “Hence, their relevance can be questioned.”Dahal added that trade unions are concentrated in Kathmandu and they have failed to work in the interest of labourers outside cities who might be in most need of their advocacy.Congress lawmaker Ghimire told the Post that when every party has its trade union in the civil service or any other institutional organisations, they may support respective party’s sister wings but will not benefit the larger society.“It is high time that the country dissolved trade unions affiliated to political parties and marched ahead for the development of the country,” Ghimire said.Rastriya Prajatantra Party (RPP) whip Bina Lama shared a more radical view at the same meeting. She said that trade unions should be completely abolished in the civil service to help bureaucracy function effectively.“Trade unions have become parties’ recruitment centres in the bureaucracy,” Lama said. “To prevent it from being expanded further, the law should prevent civil servants from joining political parties or their sister organisations.”However, Dahal differed. “Nepal is a signatory to many international treaties, which oblige us to do so. Therefore, the country cannot fully eradicate trade unions,” he said. Instead of making it a recruitment centre for political parties, as the Congress chief whip Ghimire said, Dahal advocates an umbrella trade union where all can be adjusted.“In most Western countries, including Germany, there is one official trade union that works efficiently,” Dahal added.The draft of the Federal Civil Service Act, sent by the Ministry of Federal Affairs and General Administration for discussion in the State Affairs and Good Governance Committee of the Parliament, also proposes approval of one official trade union for government employees at the federal and provincial levels.While speaking on the bill in the same meeting, Mahesh Bartaula, the chief whip of ruling party CPN-UML, stood in favour of fixing the term of reservation quota for a single person in the civil service. It means a single person should be allowed to get a government position under reservation quota for a single opportunity and then the person should compete under open category for other positions.“How long will we give the facility of reservation repeatedly for a single person? It is wrong to provide reservation to the same person in every post within the service,” Bartaula further said. “Reservation should be allowed for a person only once and it should be on the basis of class.”Bartaula also advocated for the two year cooling period for government officials while joining national and international organisations after their retirement. \nIn a secretariat meeting of the ruling CPN-UML held on Wednesday, Prime Minister and party chairman KP Sharma Oli briefed secretariat members on the political situation after the formation of the coalition with the Nepali Congress, the government's effectiveness and weaknesses, and his China visit in the first week of December, among other issues.Immediately after Oli's briefing, the secretariat members also expressed their views on the latest situation, said a UML secretariat member. The secretariat meeting also discussed the agenda of the central committee meeting which would be held on January 5 and 6.The secretariat meeting stressed the need for giving momentum to the government by expediting service delivery. The meeting also suggested reforms to make the government's functioning more effective, according to the secretariat member.An eight-member task force formed by the Congress and the UML on November 6 to strengthen ties between two parties decided to form a six-member committee to work on the issue.The Congress has appointed Semanta Dahal, Arun Paudel, and Pratap Paudel as members to suggest on service delivery. In contrast, former chief secretary of the government Lila Gadtaula and senior advocates Kedar Koirala and Rajendra Ghimire were appointed by the UML. “The prime minister's office will be our secretariat, and we are assigned to start our work from Thursday,” a service delivery task force member said. “The main job of the task force is to give policy advice to minimise hassle related to service delivery.” The task force formed to strengthen the two-party relations has Vice-president Purna Bahadur Khadka, General Secretary Gagan Thapa, Home Minister Ramesh Lekhak, and Foreign Minister Arzu Rana Deuba from the Congress. UML senior vice-chair Ishwor Pokharel, vice-chair and Finance Minister Bishnu Paudel, General Secretary Shankar Pokharel, and political adviser to the prime minister and Deputy General Secretary Bishnu Rimal are the party’s members.Congress vice-chair Khadka said that during the task force meeting, they discussed ways to address the issue of amending the constitution and other pertinent matters. “The two parties have formally entered the agenda of amending the constitution and are considering forming a mechanism for the same shortly,” Khadka said. Amending the constitution was a key promise of the seven-point agreement signed between Nepal’s two largest political parties, the Congress and the UML, in early July while forming the government led by Oli. The two parties' meeting on Tuesday, which lasted almost three hours, also discussed potential candidates to lead the constitutional amendment process. Likewise, the two ruling parties have formed a separate task force to speed up the passage of bills through Parliament.Every party has parliamentary leaders, chief whip and whip in Parliament who look after issues related to the bill, Khadka said. “Besides, we also have various committees in Parliament for the same.” \nThe National Assembly chair, deputy chair, lawmakers and other officials from the federal parliament came together at an event in Kathmandu on Tuesday to discuss the current state of implementation of federalism in the country and ways to strengthen the federal system, which has been practiced in Nepal since 2017.National Assembly Chairman Narayan Prasad Dahal said that there were some mistakes in the course of practicing the newly adopted system. “Many have expected better delivery, economic prosperity and social justice, among other things, in the federal system,” Dahal said while addressing the interaction titled ‘Federalism, National Assembly and the tasks ahead’ jointly organised by the National Assembly and Federalism and Localisation Centre in Kathmandu on Tuesday. “Honestly speaking, there have been some shortcomings.”Bimala Ghimire, vice-chair of the Assembly, said that the upper house should play more role in strengthening the provincial and local levels.Former lawmaker Khim Lal Devkota, who is also chairman of the Centre, showcased a presentation on the issues raised in the seven provincial assemblies. Assembly Secretary Surendra Aryal explained the practices implemented by the Assembly and plans ahead.Parliamentary party leaders Narayankaji Shrestha of the CPN (Maoist Centre), Beduram Bhusal of CPN (Unified Socialist), and general secretary of the parliament secretariat Padam Prasad Pandey, among other officials, also spoke about strengthening the federal system.Lawmakers representing various provinces and dozens of other lawmakers and experts working in the field brainstormed about ways to strengthen the federal system, particularly the provinces. \nFive months after forming the government led by KP Sharma Oli, coalition partners Nepali Congress and CPN-UML are in the final stages of forming mechanisms to identify the areas for amending the constitution.A major agreement between the Congress and the UML while forming the government in mid-July was to amend the constitution and review provisions that have created difficulties in its implementation.On Tuesday, the constitution amendment process finally entered bilateral talks between the Congress and the UML. An eight-member task force formed to strengthen the relations between the two parties met on Tuesday and discussed initiating the amendment process. “The issue of amendment has finally entered our discussion from today [Tuesday],” a task force member said. “We are currently discussing how to proceed and start wider discussions and consultations. We are considering forming either a political or a non-political taskforce to do the required homework.”The cross-party task force will be led by a senior politician, and comprise members of different political parties. If a non-political task force is formed, it will be led by a former chief justice of the Supreme Court or any other respected legal figure acceptable to all stakeholders. Some Congress and UML leaders have suggested forming a non-political mechanism or taskforce where legal experts, constitutional experts, human rights activists among others can be accommodated and a way ahead can be found as per their suggestions, according to a taskforce member. “We will confront difficult questions if we form a political mechanism,” he said. The meeting lasted three hours and leaders also discussed some ‘neutral’ names who can potentially lead such a mechanism or taskforce. Some political parties in the opposition have already started discussion and deliberations on the issues that need to to be addressed in order to amend the constitution. Point number two of the seven-point agreement signed between the Congress and UML in July stated that the national consensus government under the leadership of Oli would give priority to making necessary amendments to the constitution and formulating laws that ensure political stability by evaluating the strengths and weaknesses as well as the complexities seen in its implementation. “As per the understanding, our party will soon form a mechanism to identify the content for amendment,” said Home Minister Ramesh Lekhak.The Nepali Congress and the UML will soon form separate task forces to identify the contents for amendment in the constitution, Lekhak said at an event in Kathmandu. “The government has also taken an initiative on this.”“The amendment process does not end overnight. It will happen after a series of discussion and deliberations among the parties. We will assess our decade-long experience of constitutional practice and, accordingly, all political parties will sit together and make amendments,” he said.“We will initiate discussions, evaluate and assess the status of the implementation of the constitution, identify the amendment subject matters, and proceed with discussions and deliberations,” said Lekhak.The agreement between the two largest parties to amend the constitution has ignited debate in and outside political circles. Parties are divided on whether this is the right time to make changes in the constitution. But Home Minister Lekhak said the ruling and opposition parties will first review the 10-year journey of the constitution and identify its strengths and weaknesses. Second, the two ruling parties will identify the issues that need to be amended and the ruling and opposition parties will sit together for this. At last, the Congress and UML will reach an agreement on the content for amendment and table it in the house. He also clarified that the amendment to the constitution will strengthen inclusiveness rather than weaken it. The third largest party, the CPN (Maoist Centre), will also soon publicise its position on constitution amendment. The upcoming central committee meeting of the party scheduled to kick off on January 5 will open discussions on the matter, said party spokesperson Agni Prasad Sapkota. “The party has its own position on the amendment but we are open to discussions,” Sapkota said. The party will make its position public only after the meeting of its central committee.“Our position is clear: any amendment to the constitution should be for a progressive cause, not for a regressive cause. It should aim at development and prosperity. Second, there should be a directly elected president for political stability. We must opt for full inclusiveness in both houses of parliament. If we guarantee these issues in the new amendment proposal, the protracted political instability in the country will come to an end,” said Sapkota.Besides the Maoist Centre, other political parties represented in parliament are also doing homework regarding the amendment in the constitution but they are yet to make their position, preparation and homework public.Another party, the CPN (Unified Socialist), on December 17 formed a seven-member task force under party leader Prakash Jwala to work out the party’s position on the constitution amendment process. “We have formed a task force which will come out with some recommendations in this aspect,” said party spokesperson, Jagannath Khatiwada. Congress General Secretary Gagan Thapa, speaking at a party function in Kathmandu on Sunday, also said a mechanism to amend the constitution would be formed within a few days. Thapa added that the mechanism would be pragmatic and amendments would be made cautiously.“The debate on amending the constitution has begun,” Thapa said. “Within a few days, the Congress and the UML will form a mechanism. We will handle this cautiously since there is no room for adventures. We will also have a dialogue with other political parties.”He said the constitution cannot be amended just because the Congress and the UML want it. It will be done only after broad consultations among the Maoist, Madhesi and other political forces.“After reaching an agreement with all parties and stakeholders, we will amend minimum provisions necessary to ensure the constitution’s smooth functioning,” Thapa said. \nForeign Minister Arzu Rana Deuba returned from New Delhi on Monday evening, with no clarity on when Prime Minister KP Oli will make his long anticipated official visit to India. Despite Oli’s eagerness to visit the southern neighbour since taking office in mid-July, efforts to secure an invitation from New Delhi have yet to succeed. At the same time, CPN-UML deputy general secretary and former foreign minister Pradeep Gyawali also returned home from New Delhi on Monday. According to officials, both the incumbent and former foreign ministers failed to make any headway in securing a date for Prime Minister Oli’s India visit.“This time, I went to India to participate in an Indo-Nepal economic summit and for a health check-up,” she said while responding to a question at Kathmandu airport upon her arrival. “I had no political meetings or discussions this time.” Deuba, who left for the Hague, Netherlands on December 7, leading Nepal’s delegation to the International Court of Justice (ICJ), returned home via India where she also underwent a health checkup, according to a statement issued by her private secretariat. On December 9, she had presented Nepal’s position on the ‘Obligations of states in respect of climate change’ during ICJ hearings held from December 2 to 12.The hearings were initiated following the adoption of United Nations General Assembly Resolution A/RES/77/276, which requested the ICJ’s advisory opinion on states’ responsibilities concerning climate change.She then travelled to Berlin, Germany, to attend the Equal Rights Coalition Conference, scheduled on December 17 and 18. The conference was hosted by German Federal Minister for Foreign Affairs Annalena Baerbock on behalf of the Coalition’s co-chairs, Germany and Mexico. During her Europe visit, Minister Deuba held several high-level discussions with officials from Belgium, Luxembourg, Germany, and the European Union.On Monday, before leaving for Kathmandu, she participated in an interaction at India Foundation which is led by Ram Madhav, former general secretary of the Bharatiya Janata Party. Deuba’s Delhi trip came with high expectations, especially after her last visit in August, when she met Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi as well as her counterpart, S. Jaishankar. But this time, the visit was unofficial and she thus could not meet Indian leaders, one official at the foreign ministry said. As she was in Delhi for her regular check up, no formal meetings were planned, according to Deuba’s private secretariat. But according to some Nepali Congress leaders, she tried her best to meet her counterpart, Jaishankar, and other Indian leaders in order to create a positive environment for the prime minister’s India visit, but her attempts were unsuccessful. The prime minister’s office also expected foreign minister Deuba, with her profile and good connections in the Indian establishment, to be able to meet top Indian leaders and lay the ground for the prime minister’s India visit. After the prime minister failed to secure an invitation from India, Oli went on his first bilateral visit to China in December first week and signed a framework for cooperation on the Belt and Road Initiative. According to a Nepali Congress leader closely following the dynamics between Oli and New Delhi, India appears uncomfortable with the deal Oli signed in Beijing, adding uncertainty to his Delhi trip. Also, there is unease in the Congress after the party leadership failed to maintain the party position of not taking loans under the BRI framework.While in Delhi, Rana had addressed an Indo-Nepal economic conference, met some policymakers and discussed the future of Nepal-India relations. Despite getting no invitation from India, Oli, speaking in his hometown in the district of Jhapa, had declared that he would visit India soon. “We have achieved good results from my China visit. Some people don’t believe I am going to India. But I am, and unexpected results will be achieved,” Oli had said. \nBetween Saturday and Monday night, at least three people were murdered in the Kathmandu valley.Milan Acharya took the lives of his father Kul Prasad and younger brother Prabin at Fika Dhara ward 2 of Suryabinayak Municipality, Bhaktapur on Saturday night. After two days, on Monday night, 23-year-old Nayan Gurung was murdered at the Town Cafe in Chyasal, Lalitpur.According to initial police investigation reports, no definite reason for the two murders has been found other than a momentary impulse on the part of the assailant.After a failed suicide bid, Acharya surrendered himself, Nepal Police spokesperson Bishwa Adhikari said. There is a mark from attempted suicide on his body, and police are investigating the matter.The bodies of 56-year-old Kul Prasad and his 22-year-old son Prabin were found in separate rooms of their residence in ward 2 of Suryabinayak Municipality, Fika Dhara.“After breaking into the house on Monday morning, we found the father and younger son dead in separate rooms,” said Deputy Superintendent Dhundiraj Neupane, spokesperson for the Bhaktapur District Police Range. “As per our initial investigation, the murders were committed on Saturday night. However, it came to our notice on Monday morning after one of their neighbours informed us that the doors to the rooms had been locked for the past two days.”The younger son’s body was found on a bed in a makeshift kitchen, while the father’s body was in another room. Both had injuries below their ears. Police recovered a traditional stone grinder and a dumbbell with blood and hair at the scene.The Acharya brothers had been renting a ground-floor room in the three-storey house for three years.The Acharya family is from Diktel Rupakot Majhuwagadhi Municipality in Khotang district. The deceased, Kul Prasad, was the acting head of the Khotang District Post Office while younger son Prabin was pursuing a BSc degree.Nepal Police has also arrested three people on charges of murder of Nayan Gurung and have taken them under investigation.According to District Police Range Lalitpur spokesperson Navratna Paudel Gurung, who had visited the Town Cafe in Chyasal on Monday night, was involved in a fatal brawl with the cafe staff in the course of paying the bill.“Gurung was stabbed to death,” spokesperson Paudel said. Those arrested are Hemraj Bhatta, 26, who works at the restaurant; Janak Bahadur Tamang, 22, of Kavre; and Padmalal Bhatta, 41, of Darchula.Milan Acharya, who had absconded following the Fika Dhara incident, turned himself in at the Maharajgunj Police Circle on Tuesday morning to confess to the murder of his father and brother. According to Bishwa Adhikari, spokesperson for Nepal Police, Acharya has confessed to killing his father and younger brother. Adhikari says that Acharya cited depression as the reason for the murder.“My father had depression, I failed to pass the civil service exams despite multiple attempts, and my younger brother was not good at studying, which had further exacerbated the family’s frustrations,” Adhikari quoted Acharya as saying. “I decided to relieve my family by killing them and later killing myself.” Psychiatrist Dr Basudev Karki, who has been actively involved in establishing the field of Community Psychiatry in Nepal, says that in most such cases the murderers as well as those who commit serious crimes have poor mental health. “The parents, the surrounding environment, the whole society, affects an individual’s upbringing. If they are not brought up right, there is a high chance of them committing various kinds of crimes after they grow up,” said Karki.Of late, there has been a spate of murders. As per initial investigation by Nepal Police, most murder cases result from personal enmity. Talking to the media on December 18, Nepal Police spokesperson Adhikari said: “The increasing cases of murders are due to personal grievances rather than criminal motives.”As per the police data, in the first four months of the fiscal year 2024-25, at least 192 people have been murdered.Anthropologist Dambar Chemjong says that individuals see themselves as alienated from society when they fail to cope with the rapidly changing social, political, economic and technological changes, which leads to depression, suicidal tendencies and criminal activities.“When social beliefs, norms and values are diluted due to rapid changes in society, people can breach the norms of human life on a momentary impulse,” Chemjong added. “I see the same tendency in Acharya’s case.” \nMilan Acharya, who had been absconding following the Balkot incident, turned himself in at the Maharajgunj Police Circle on Tuesday morning.According to police sources, Acharya has confessed to killing his father and younger brother.The bodies of 56-year-old Kul Prasad Acharya and his 22-year-old son Prabin Acharya were discovered on Monday in separate rooms of their residence in ward 2 of Suryabinayak Municipality, Balkot.“We found the father and younger son dead after breaking into the house on Monday morning. Their bodies were in separate rooms,” said Deputy Superintendent of Police Dhundiraj Neupane, spokesperson for Bhaktapur District Police Range. The younger son’s body was found on a bed in a makeshift kitchen, while the father’s body was in another room. Both had injuries below their ears. Police recovered a traditional stone grinder and a dumbbell with blood and hair at the scene. The Acharya brothers had been renting a ground-floor room in the three-storey house for three years. The Acharya family hails from Diktel Rupakot Majhuwagadhi Municipality in Khotang district. The deceased, Kul Prasad Acharya, was acting head of the Khotang District Post Office. Elder son Milan had been preparing for public service exams, while younger son Prabin was pursuing a BSc degree. \nThe Kathmandu Metropolitan City has announced that it will start random on-the-spot emission testing of vehicles on the road beginning next week.The move of the city office comes amid deteriorating air quality in Kathmandu Valley.“We have provided necessary training to two mechanical engineers, who will be deployed for emission testing,” said Jagatman Shrestha, traffic expert adviser at the metropolis. “We have also coordinated with the environment department of the federal government, traffic police, and the department of transport management to start these tests.”The city office has purchased two smoke meters (a portable device for testing vehicle emissions)—one for diesel vehicles and the other for petrol vehicles—to carry out emission testing. Officials say, for the first time, motorcycles and scooters will also be tested.Though vehicle emission testing is mainly the responsibility of federal government agencies, the constitution also mandates local governments to take measures to reduce pollution, officials say.The metropolis has developed pollution control guidelines as per the KMC Environment and Natural Resources Protection Act-2021.Officials say these random tests will be conducted on vehicles that have passed emission testing from the department of transport management and received green stickers, as all four-wheelers on the road typically do. However, some may still emit black smoke for various reasons, including lack of timely servicing and maintenance.Many automobile owners only service their vehicles ahead of the annual pollution testing. “We will not issue green stickers to vehicles but check emission levels,” said Shrestha. “If we find vehicles emitting pollutants more than permissible levels, we will slap a fine.”According to the officials, Rs1,000 will be fined for polluting vehicles for the first time.Random vehicle testing is among the measures the city office is taking to tackle air pollution.The municipal environment department has also started monitoring the city’s air quality independently. For that, the city office has installed portable devices in various locations. “We have already installed portable air quality monitoring devices in 16 locations within the metropolis and are preparing to install three more,” said Sarita Rai, chief of the department. “We have also launched a drive to make people aware of air pollution.”Nepal’s air quality reaches hazardous levels several times a year, and the capital city often becomes the world’s most polluted metropolis.According to IQ AirVisual, a Swiss group that collects air quality data from around the world, Kathmandu’s PM2.5 levels reached 197 micrograms per cubic metre (μg/m3) on Friday afternoon.PM2.5 refers to particulate matter (solid or liquid droplets) in the air that is less than 2.5 micrometres in diameter. It is among the most dangerous pollutants that can get past the nose and throat to penetrate the lungs and get into the bloodstream. PM2.5 particles are small and likely to stay suspended in the air for long, increasing the chances of people inhaling them.As per the Environmental Protection Agency’s air quality index, when air quality reaches 151-200, it is considered unhealthy; everyone may experience problems, with sensitive groups feeling more severe effects.Major hospitals report a spike in respiratory problems due to the impact of toxic air and dust. Meanwhile, the city office said it had installed push-button traffic lights in 36 locations for the ease of pedestrians. “We are working to bring those devices into operation soon,” said Shrestha, traffic adviser of the metropolis. “Pedestrians can push the button to stop traffic and cross the road safely.”Push-button devices are installed at traffic intersections to allow pedestrians to request stop road traffic, so that they can cross the road without fear. \nNepali Congress candidate Krishnaman Dangol has been elected mayor of Kirtipur Municipality in the by-election held on Sunday. Dangol secured 5,334 votes, defeating his closest rival, Shivsharan Maharjan of the Maoist Centre, by 779 votes.Maharjan received 4,555 votes, while Surendra Manandhar of the CPN-UML garnered 4,337 votes.The by-election was held following the demise of former mayor Rajkumar Nakarmi, who passed away on July 26 last year due to a kidney-related illness. Nakarmi, also from the Congress, was elected Mayor in the 2022 local elections.Kirtipur, historically known as a left-leaning stronghold, saw a shift in political dynamics with Nakarmi’s victory in 2022. Kirtipur was declared a municipality in 1997. \nKrishnaman Dangol of the Nepali Congress has maintained a lead in the ongoing vote count for the mayor of Kirtipur Municipality. As of the latest tally, Dangol has garnered 789 votes, while Surendra Manandhar of the CPN-UML trails with 666 votes. Shivsharan Maharjan of the CPN (Maoist Centre) has received 465 votes. Among independent candidates, Rajman Maharjan has secured 418 votes, Dinesh Kumar Adhikari 236, and Kabikumar Maharjan 58. Rastriya Prajatantra Party’s Dhruba Maharjan has obtained 119 votes, while Bhanu Rijal of the CPN (Unified Socialist) has 22 votes.   \n\nThis year’s ‘Ncell Woman ICON ICT Award’ has been conferred to Bandana Sharma, who has been recognised for her significant contributions to the field of information technology. She recently received this prestigious award at the Grand Finale of the ICT Award 2024.Chief Minister of Karnali Province, Yamlal Kadel, and Ncell’s Corporate Communications and CSR Head, Bishakha Laxmi Khadka, jointly presented the ‘Ncell Woman ICON ICT Award 2024’ to Sharma. Currently serving as the Head of the Cards and Digital Banking Division at Nepal Bank, Sharma also received a cash prize of Rs300,000 along with the award.Every year, this award is presented to a woman who has made remarkable contributions to Nepal’s ICT sector. “We are delighted to continue this collaboration to encourage women in ICT and recognise their contributions,” said Bishakha Laxmi Khadka, Head of Corporate Communications and CSR at Ncell.Sharma began her career as an IT Support Officer at Nepal Bank in 2006. She has been instrumental in the bank’s digital transformation, contributing to core banking systems, network security, cybersecurity, and the development of customer-friendly digital services and infrastructure. \nIn June 2022, the Hotel Association Nepal announced a ban on single-use plastics starting January 1, 2025, as part of its commitment to reducing plastic pollution and promoting sustainable tourism. Single-use plastics are designed to be used once and thrown away.As the countdown begins, the initiative looks out of bounds for many hotels, particularly smaller ones, though big ones have already started phasing out single-use plastics.“Most luxury hotels have already implemented the decision,” said Binayak Shah, president of the Hotel Association Nepal, the umbrella body of the hotels and resorts in Nepal. “But for small hotels, whose occupancy is currently only a third of their capacity, it appears difficult.”Replacing plastic with glass bottles or eco-friendly products is expensive, said Shah.Single-use plastics commonly used in hotels include water bottles, straws, cutlery, plates, drink stirrers, expanded polystyrene food service products, toothbrushes, and combs. Nepal has 1,416 hotels, including star-rated and tourist standard establishments, offering a combined daily bed capacity of 54,370.Even in luxury hotels, eliminating plastic water bottles has been a big challenge, according to hoteliers.For example, a seal on a plastic water bottle certified with the NS mark ensures quality.“But no glass water bottles available in Kathmandu come with a seal and NS mark. This has put a question mark on quality assurance,” said Shah. “However, we are in talks with bottling plants. As this can be a big business opportunity, they are responding positively.”“The project may take some time to implement.”The plastic-free initiative, however, could provide a viable business prospect in Nepal, although it may initially be expensive.Bikas Khatri, director of Wave Nepal Pvt Ltd, a Kakani-based exporter of plastic bottled mineral water, said luxury hotels globally have started offering glass-bottled water to prioritise eco-friendly practices that align with modern consumer values.Unlike plastic, glass can be recycled indefinitely without losing quality, supporting a circular economy and helping businesses achieve sustainability goals.“Currently, we are getting orders for refilled water in ‘lock bottles’ from luxury hotels like Aloft, Marriott, and Hilton,” said Khatri. “Due to the high demand, we have ordered 20,000 glass bottles from India to launch the project, which will begin by mid-January.”The glass-bottled water will be distributed like Coke and Pepsi. A quality 500-ml bottle will cost Rs55 without adding transport cost. “So, after factoring in taxes and profit margins, a bottle may cost Rs100,” said Khatri. “This is the cost of the first delivery. By the fourth refill, the cost would be halved.” “It’s a trial. Based on demand, we are also planning to import a refilling machine worth around $35,000,” said Khatri.Most mineral water suppliers in Kathmandu use polycarbonate jars in addition to plastic bottled water.According to estimates, the Kathmandu Valley consumes 100,000 water jars daily. In the peak season or summer, the valley alone uses 30,000 cases (12 bottles each case) of plastic bottled mineral water. A five-star hotel, if fully occupied, consumes nearly Rs200,000 of water per day. Unlike plastic, glass is fully recyclable and can be used multiple times, making it an environmentally responsible choice. By reducing reliance on single-use plastics, restaurants and hotels significantly cut down on waste, contributing to a cleaner planet.Plastic is one of the most important innovations, but single-use plastic products have a severe negative impact on the environment. Plastic is a convenient comfort in today’s world because of its inexpensive production cost and wide range of applications.Single-use plastic products are more likely to end up in rivers than reusable options.Plastic is a non-biodegradable material and most plastic is made from fossil fuels. If burnt, it poisons the air; if buried, it pollutes the soil. And plastic wastes dumped haphazardly have been clogging sewer mains and rivers, and polluting oceans.Nepal still does not have effective waste recycling plants although several private firms have been recycling solid waste and producing compost manure on a small scale.According to an Asian Development Bank report, a waste composition analysis in Nepal indicates that the highest waste fraction is organic matter (66 percent), followed by plastics (12 percent), paper and paper products (9 percent), others (5 percent), and glass (3 percent). Metal, textiles, and rubber and leather each account for 2 percent or less.The most commonly found single-use plastic items in Nepal are plastic drinking bottles, littering rivers and rivulets. With the growing number of climbers, mainly on the world’s highest peak, Mt Everest, plastic waste has infiltrated the Himalayas and polluted freshwater sources.The International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development (ICIMOD) said in its report that Kathmandu alone uses around 4.7 million to 4.8 million plastic bags a day. In Nepal, 16 percent of urban waste consists of plastic, which is 2.7 tonnes of daily plastic garbage production, it said.Besides the sheer quantity of plastic waste being produced, a major problem with plastic is its resistance to degradation, ICIMOD said. A conservative estimate puts the average time for one single plastic bag to completely biodegrade at 500 years, it said.“This means not only that most of the plastic we use during our lives will outlive us, but that our plastic footprint also will affect generations to come.”In April 2015, Nepal declared Kathmandu a polythene bag-free zone. Several other areas have followed suit and declared themselves plastic-free, including Parbat, Myagdi, Damak and Ilam.Plastic bans in urban mountain centres like Gangtok and Nainital in India in the late 1990s have demonstrated that daily life is as comfortable with reduced plastic use, according to ICIMOD.Since January 2020, the Everest region, which has gained notoriety as the “world’s highest garbage dump”, imposed a ban on the use of plastic bags, bottles and other plastic items, citing their adverse effects on human health.The use of plastic bags thinner than 30 microns has also been prohibited.The Everest region has long struggled to manage the solid waste visitors to the region bring along every year.On October 21, the Department of Tourism announced a ban on plastic bottles in four- and five-star deluxe and luxury hotels as a part of its push towards environmental sustainability.  \nOver 1,500 children under five years of age from Banke district have been found suffering from malnutrition–either moderately or severely–in the last five months. The number could be even higher, as not all the children of the age group have been screened.“The number of the diagnosed cases were reported by the health facilities, where ailing children were taken for treatment or reported by female community health volunteers,” said Angad Bahadur Shahi, chief of the Health Office, Banke. “A separate screening programme has been started, which will tell the exact scenario.”Malnutrition is considered a silent health crisis in Nepal. The country has made significant progress in reducing stunting among children under five, which fell from 57 percent in 2001 to 25 percent in 2022, according to the Nepal Demographic and Health Survey-2022.However, the progress is not the same in all provinces. More than 16 percent of the children under five years in Lumbini Province [Banke district is part of Lumbini Province] suffer from wasting—the most immediate, visible, and life-threatening form of malnutrition.Child health experts say a sharp rise in moderately and severely acute malnutrition cases in Banke is alarming, which could hinder attempts to reduce malnutrition and overall hunger problems. The increase in the problems will also hinder the attempts to achieve the United Nations-backed Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). SDGs, a follow-up on the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), aim to end poverty, hunger and all forms of inequality in the world by 2030. Nepal has set targets to meet those goals.The country needs to reduce stunting to 15 percent from the existing 25 percent by 2030 to meet the SDGs targets, wasting to 4 percent from the current eight percent and underweight to 10 percent from the existing 19 percent.Wasting or underweight for one’s height in children, if not treated properly and on time, is associated with a higher mortality risk, according to the World Health Organisation.“Severe acute malnutrition is a medical emergency, and such children need immediate hospital admission and treatment,” said Dr Shyam Raj Upreti, a child health expert who is also the former director general at the Department of Health Services. “Detection of moderately acute malnutrition means the problems have started recently.” He said these indicators show that efforts to rein in existing malnutrition problems and end them permanently are insufficient.Malnutrition plays a major role in the under-five mortality rate. The problem also hinders children’s mental development and eventually affects the country’s economic health by weakening intellectual capacity, reducing productivity in adulthood, and increasing vulnerability to diseases, according to experts.Health authorities have taken various measures to address malnutrition problems, including distributing ready-to-use food and running nutrition rehab homes in 24 federal and provincial hospitals. Severely acute malnourished children get admitted and treated in those centres. Experts stressed addressing moderately acute malnutrition problems, which are likely to become severe if not treated timely.“Many people consider malnutrition only a health problem, but it is a multisectoral problem, which needs a multisectoral approach to deal with,” said Upreti. “Treating severely malnourished children does not stop the problems. We need to address the poverty of their families.”Experts said non-health interventions—awareness drives, improved financial conditions of people, their education levels, and sanitation conditions—could go a long way in improving health indicators, including nutrition status.“We have made a multisectoral nutrition plan to address the existing malnutrition problems,” said Lila Bikram Thapa, chief of the Nutrition Section at the Family Welfare Division under the Department of Health Services. “Sincere efforts of all concerned stakeholders can address the existing problems.”Malnutrition affects the physical as well as mental growth of children, which ultimately affects the country’s economic health, according to experts. \nThe Ministry of Health and Population said that a decision on whether to lower the iodine content in salt will be taken only after a micronutrient status survey, which will start in May next year.The nationwide survey to be carried out after 10 years, with the financial support of USAID and technical support of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, will be completed in 2026.“The decision to lower the iodine content in salt will be taken only after assessing the level of iodine in the urine of children and pregnant women,” said Lila Bikram Thapa, chief of the Nutrition Section of the Family Welfare Division under the Department of Health Services. “We hope the new report of the micronutrient survey will help us make appropriate decisions.”Iodine is a mineral found naturally in seafood and plants that grow in areas near the sea. In places where iodine is naturally rare, it needs to be artificially introduced into the diet via fortified food products.The Salt Trading Corporation, the agency responsible for importing and distributing salt in Nepal, fortifies iodine at 50 ppm (parts per million) per kilogram of salt, which is higher than the recommended dosage. The World Health Organisation, however, recommends iodine concentration at 15 to 40 ppm per kg. Only 40 ppm of iodine per kilogramme of salt is fortified for India, as it is assumed that the Indian population does not need as much iodine as the Nepali people, since they also get iodine content from foods produced near the ocean.Health experts in Nepal have blamed the excessive amounts of iodine content in salt for the rise in non-communicable diseases, including hypothyroidism.Several studies—including the 2016 Nepal National Micronutrient Status Survey jointly carried out by the World Health Organisation, UNICEF, the US-based Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, and the Ministry of Health and Population—found that Nepalis consume excessive amounts of iodine, which has resulted in high prevalence of hyperthyroidism, a condition when the thyroid gland does not produce enough thyroid hormones.The survey showed that more than two-thirds—68 percent—of the population across the country is consuming iodine far in excess of the recommended levels.According to the Non-communicable Disease Risk Factors: Steps Survey-2019, 5.6 percent of the adults (6.5 percent of women and 4.6 percent of men) reported adding salt often or always to food right before or while eating.Additionally, 19.5 percent of the adults (18.1 percent of the women and 21.1 percent of men) reported consuming processed foods that are often or always high in salt.Doctors in Nepal suspect that the high iodine content in the salt being sold in Nepal could be among the reasons for the high prevalence of several non-communicable diseases, including thyroid disorders and hypertension.A change in dietary patterns and an increased consumption of processed foods (including packaged soups) have resulted in an increased prevalence of non-communicable diseases such as hypertension and cardiovascular diseases, they added.Earlier, the government had sent a team of experts to salt factories in India’s Gujarat state to study the iodine fortification process and the possibility of lowering the iodine content in salt. The expert team furnished its report, but the concerned authorities could not decide on the reduction of iodine level in salt.“We have decided to wait further until the report of the planned survey comes,” said Thapa. “The report will help us analyse what changes have happened in the last 10 years and make appropriate decisions.”In 1993, Nepal mandated that salt be fortified with iodine to prevent health problems caused by iodine deficiency, as salt is both cheap and used round the year.Officials said the higher iodine level was mandated for Nepal under the assumption that transport and storage times were longer at the time as the salt had to be carried on the backs of men and animals and some amount of iodine would dissipate by the time the salt reached markets, mainly in the remote parts of the country.However, with roads reaching almost all corners of the country, transportation time has significantly decreased, so there is no need for such a high level of iodine in salt, say doctors.The World Health Organisation recommends less than two grams of sodium or five grams of salt per day for adults to reduce blood pressure, and cut the risks of cardiovascular diseases and stroke. \nThe Ministry of Health and Population is preparing to launch a nationwide campaign offering the public free screenings for certain non-communicable diseases—hypertension, diabetes, and renal function, among others—in the ongoing fiscal year.The move aims to make people aware of the growing burden of non-communicable diseases, which account for around 80 percent of total deaths, officials say.“As per the instruction of the health minister [Pradip Poudel], we are planning to launch a nationwide campaign to screen for certain non-communicable diseases,” said Dr Yadu Chandra Ghimire, director of the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division. “The campaign will be launched in the month of Falgun (February 13 to March 13).”Non-communicable diseases—hypertension, diabetes, renal disease, liver problems, heart problems, and cervical cancer, among others have emerged as major killers in recent years, accounting for around 80 percent of total deaths. According to a 2019 study on the prevalence of non-communicable diseases by the Nepal Health Research Council, 71 percent of total deaths at present were due to non-communicable diseases, and an additional eight percent of deaths were linked to injuries. The study was primarily focused on behavioural risk factors like tobacco and alcohol consumption, as well as biological risk factors like high blood pressure, overweight, obesity, abnormal lipid levels, coronary artery disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and diabetes. Officials hope that free screenings for non-communicable diseases will help raise awareness of risk factors and ultimately help lessen the disease burden.“This campaign aims to make people aware of the emerging risk factors caused by our changing lifestyle, food habits, and stress levels, among other things,” said Ghimire. Officials say that health workers will also organise outreach camps in remote areas where people must walk for hours for health screening.“The main purpose of the free screening campaign of non-communicable diseases is to make people aware of the problems,” said Dr Pomawati Thapa, chief of the Mental Health Section at the division. “The burden of non-communicable diseases has been raised alarmingly of late, and people are seeking care only when the problems worsen.”Early diagnosis and precautionary measures can help stop health problems from becoming serious, doctors say.Public health experts say that it is high time to focus on non-communicable diseases, as their burden has raised alarmingly. As most people do not undergo testing unless there is an emergency, doctors say it may be too late when the symptoms surface. They say that many lives could be saved if testing of non-communicable diseases is made free.Along with free testing, authorities must focus on behavioural changes—improvements in eating habits and physical exercises, among other things.“Countries like ours have been facing a double burden—an alarming rise in non-communicable diseases and the emergence of new vector-borne diseases and other communicable diseases,” said Dr Mingmar Gyelgen Sherpa, former director general at the Department of Health Services. “Due to excessive use of processed foods, which contain preservatives, people suffer from multiple non-communicable diseases.”Several studies show alarming signs on a number of issues including growing consumption of alcohol, tobacco, salt and junk food, and insufficient intake of vegetables and fruits, which lead to cardiovascular diseases. Doctors say that along with ensuring free screening and treatment, authorities concerned should focus on raising awareness about lifestyle changes and associated risks. \nWith the confirmation of the second mpox case in Nepal, the Ministry of Health and Population has stepped up surveillance measures to prevent a possible outbreak of the deadly viral disease.Nepal reported the latest case on Friday. A 36-year-old man from Tanahun, who returned from Saudi Arabia on Thursday, tested positive for the disease. Nepal confirmed its first case of mpox infection in June last year, when a 60-year-old foreign national had tested positive.“We have increased health screenings of passengers entering the country from abroad, as per the instruction of the Ministry of Health and Population,” said Kanchhi Maya Twanju, a health worker deployed at the health desk set up at the Tribhuvan International Airport. “We have been instructed to send passengers having fever and those showing symptoms of mpox infection directly to hospitals.”Mpox is a rare disease caused by infection with the mpox virus and one in 10 infected persons can die. Most common in remote parts of central and west Africa, the disease has now been reported in at least 122 countries. Beyond Africa, monkeypox is spreading chiefly in men who have sex with men, putting sexual health clinics on alert for new cases.Along with stepping up screening of the passengers entering the country via TIA, health authorities have requested dermatologists throughout the country to refer suspected cases for testing.“We have alerted dermatologists about the risk of an outbreak of mpox virus in the country and have requested them to refer suspected cases for testing,” said Dr Yadu Chandra Ghimire, director of the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division. “We will take additional measures following consultations with stakeholders, including the World Health Organisation’s Nepal representatives.”Public health experts in Nepal say that screening suspects at health desks at international airports and land crossings is not sufficient to prevent outbreaks since it usually takes between five and 21 days for the first symptoms of mpox to appear, and not all cases of infection can be detected at health desks.Monkeypox cases have been reported in neighbouring India, with which Nepal shares a long, porous border. India has recorded at least 30 mpox infections since 2022.Health experts say that even if the rare viral infection is usually mild and most people recover within weeks, the risks should not be underestimated. They stress precautions, saying that every disease seen in any corner of the world can come to Nepal due to the high mobility of people.“We didn’t expect that the infected person would come from Saudi Arabia, as there is no outbreak currently,” said Dr Sher Bahadur Pun, chief of the Clinical Research Unit at Sukraraj Tropical and Infectious Disease Hospital. “This incident shows that the deadly disease may come from any country, and we must remain vigilant and prepare agencies concerned accordingly.”Doctors say preventing an outbreak of the deadly viral disease is not the sole responsibility of a single health agency, and it is impossible to do so.“Every agency and person, including passengers, should shoulder the responsibility and take preventive measures,” Pun stated.Mpox has been a globally neglected public health problem in parts of Africa for decades. The disease came to widespread attention after May 2022, with countries outside Africa reporting new cases.Mpox has since spread globally. More than 100,000 people from 122 countries have already tested positive for the disease.Its symptoms include fever, headache, swelling, body pains, exhaustion, and itchy rashes on the face, hands, and feet.As the disease primarily spreads through close person-to-person contact, public health experts recommend self-isolation and good hygiene to avoid it.Meanwhile, health officials informed that the condition of the infected man is normal and he will remain in hospital isolation for an additional two weeks.They said that they are also working to trace close contacts between the patients on the plane and the taxi driver who took him to the hospital. \nThe holiday season has its rules, from its distinct colour palette to the cold weather. Listen closely, and you can hear the sound of bells jingling with their particular charm.If you are like me, the best thing to do during this time of year is to make yourself cosy in bed, wrap your blanket tightly, and snooze the alarm until the very last minute before being pulled by daily mundane routine. But once you start to see the familiar shades of red and white peeking through the decorations and hear the distinct tune of ‘All I Want for Christmas Is You’ by Mariah Carey blasting through every department store you visit, with the smell of cocoa drifting through the air, you begin to grin from ear to ear, knowing that the holiday season is here. For me, this time of year is all about my friends and family, the warmth they provide through their presence, the never-ending chats, hand warmers, and not to forget my annual passionate love affair with electric heaters! (Trust me, we two are inseparable!). The sounds of carols and bells reinforce my passion for baking, but then again, it might just be the cold weather tempting me to make something special for my loved ones to reciprocate the warmth and affection they provide me.

The Department of Agriculture and Livestock, under KMC, found mold in packaged food items during an inspection prompted by customer complaints.Dr Awadhesh Jha, an inspection officer from the department, stated that the KMC call centre received complaints alleging the sale of “expired, rotten, and pest-infested food” at the store. Following the inspection, 44 packets of coconuts were found to contain mold, leading to their destruction on Friday and the subsequent fine imposed on the supermarket.In an official statement, KMC emphasised the importance of adhering to food safety regulations, saying, “The penalty amount must be deposited into the city’s revenue account. Moving forward, ensure that all items sold comply with Nepal’s laws and maintain high-quality standards fit for consumption.” \nNepal Foods has been named Best Nepali Brand of the Year 2024 at the 9th Asian Food and Restaurant Awards International, held at the Royal Ascot. The event recognised excellence in the culinary industry, celebrating cultural diversity and innovation.The awards are known for highlighting outstanding contributions to the UK’s food sector. Nepal Foods’ achievement reflects its commitment to quality and authenticity in Nepalese cuisine.Bikash Nepal, Director of Nepal Foods, expressed pride in receiving the award, stating, “This recognition celebrates our efforts to promote Nepali culture and cuisine globally. It’s a testament to the dedication of our team.”With products available in the USA, Canada, Australia, Europe, and Japan, Nepal Foods continues to showcase Nepali gastronomy on an international stage. \nDusit Princess Kathmandu is organising a five-day trout festival at its SOI restaurant. The dishes will be available for order from 12:30 pm to 10:00 pm every day till August 30. In celebration of Nepal’s rivers and lakes, which provide an ideal environment for high-quality trout, the Director of Culinary Food and Beverage Service, Chef Utpal Mondal, and his team at Dusit Princess Kathmandu have crafted a menu showcasing the flavours and versatility of locally sourced trout. “As the festive month of Shrawan ends, people focus on healthy and nutritious food. Trout, rich in omega-3 fatty acids, vitamins, and essential minerals, offers a heart-friendly option that checks all the boxes from a nutritional and culinary standpoint,” says Mondal.He adds that the goal of the culinary event is to offer their guests a rare opportunity to experience a wide variety of trout dishes they wouldn’t typically find at home.The event menu features twelve unique dishes, six of which are drawn from diverse culinary traditions across continents. Three dishes are inspired by oriental cuisine, while the remaining three highlight flavours from Nepal and India. The menu has been designed to include various dishes, from soups and starters to main courses, including Mexican, Italian, Continental, and Thai flavours.While discussing the event’s highlights, Mondal said, “The celebration presents a unique opportunity for guests to indulge in a diverse range of trout-based dishes, something they wouldn’t typically have the chance to experience elsewhere.” \nI can vividly remember my first encounter with baking when I was 10 years old. We had just moved to our new home and got a cable connection. The cable opened a world of possibilities, as it gave me access to various contents.This was back in the late 2000s when YouTube would take hours to load, taunting us with its buffering screen. I was particularly drawn to travel and lifestyle channels, mainly TLC, Fox Life, and Food Network, which kept me informed about different foods and cultures. I don’t know why, but I was always drawn to desserts. It was fascinating to see how these miraculous treats made people smile at the end of the meal.Growing up in Nepal, I noticed that baking wasn't very common. While some families did have ovens, they were mostly multifunctional ones used primarily for heating food.I also noticed that most of our desserts didn't require an oven, as they could be made on a stovetop. So, you can imagine my excitement when my mom decided to buy an oven during one of her festive shopping sprees.I could finally feel the joy these channels portrayed. (I blame food writer Nigella Lawson for getting me hooked on a domestic lifestyle.) Then, one day, after watching one of the cooking episodes on television, I finally mustered enough strength and decided to bake something. I distinctly remember wanting to make a chocolate cake for myself after watching one of Rachel Allen’s bake series. I watched all the ingredients used in that recipe and scurried across my pantry, only to realise I didn’t have half of the stuff she mentioned. I then decided to improvise the recipe (a big mistake). I randomly combined the ingredients that I had in a mixing bowl and chucked the batter into my oven, hoping for a magical cake to pop out an hour later.After I saw the result an hour later, I was mortified. The cake was stuck in the pan, refusing to come out, and it was as dense as fudge. I convinced myself that the taste was what mattered most, but when I served a slice to my brother, he made a face of utter disgust.That was the day I realised that baking soda was not the same as baking powder.After this incident, I researched baking and found out it was technical. This was a blessing in disguise for me, as I loved science, and I started to view baking as a science experiment. I then reflected and evaluated how to perfect one's baking skills.I analysed my errors and noted down all the steps I did every time I baked. Home baking is a passion for many. The idea of turning a few simple ingredients into a delicious masterpiece is as enchanting as it sounds.Yet, for many of us, this seemingly magical process can often turn into a series of unfortunate events, leading to crumbled dreams and deflated ambitions. Dense cakes, burnt crusts, rock-hard cookies and unrisen bread, if you are an amateur baker, then you have seen it all. But why do these mishaps happen so often? And most importantly how do we overcome them?From my experience, behind every successful bake lies a series of challenges and mishaps that test even the most dedicated bakers. Baking has its own set of rules that you need to follow to get that scrumptious treat every time. So, to transform a recipe into an actual dish that will impress your friends and family, I am sharing with you some of the tips and tricks I learned from my tumultuous journey as a home baker.First things first, we have to look into the prime appliance that we are working with. Commercial ovens are of two types: one that runs on gas and the other that runs on electricity. We have to look at the oven present at our home and consider its pros and cons. The main benefits of a gas oven are its size and temperature control. One can quickly change the temperature just by twisting the knob, and it preheats much more quickly than an electric one. However, they are known to have uneven temperatures at times and release more humidity, making it harder to properly crisp or brown food. This can result in burnt edges and cold or hot spots. An electric oven, on the other hand, provides more even and consistent temperatures and doesn’t release as much moisture in the air.This dry oven environment makes it easier to brown your items, making it great for baking bread. However, while the dry oven results in more even cooking, you also run the risk of drying out cakes and other baked goods.Also, many people forget to preheat the oven before baking, which is crucial for maintaining an even temperature throughout the baking process. When baking cakes and bread, I like to place a small tray of water at the bottom of the oven to provide moisture and prevent the baked goods from drying out.An oven thermometer can be a baker's best friend, providing a true reading and ensuring your creations bake evenly. I also like rotating the pan midway while baking, as it allows for an even distribution of heat.The next thing people mess up on is measuring and the specificity of ingredients in a recipe. Our moms made our food with their instinct; it is something that they learned along the way, but when you are baking, you cannot instinctively add or omit a few steps.I think that is why we initially had problems with baking. In a culture where cooking comes instinctually, baking challenges us, to be precise. A gram of more or less of any ingredient can drastically alter the outcome. Different methods of measuring flour can yield different results.Every component in baking serves a distinct purpose and function. Flour offers structure, sugar adds sweetness and moisture, eggs bind things together, and butter enhances taste and texture. However, not all ingredients are created equally. For example, using salted butter instead of unsalted might change the taste profile of your meal.Similarly, different flours have varying protein concentrations, which affect the texture of baked goods. The type of sugar used also makes a difference. Granulated sugar, brown sugar, powdered sugar, and speciality sugars like turbinado or muscovado each add unique flavours to a bake.Understanding these nuances and how they interact is critical for getting the intended outcomes. Accurate measurement tools and techniques are essential, but mastering them can be a steep learning curve. So, I would recommend investing in a kitchen scale that allows for more accurate measurements by weight rather than volume.Moving on, leavening agents such as baking soda, baking powder, and yeast are required to make baked goods rise. However, they can also cause confusion and errors. Baking soda needs an acidic component to activate, but baking powder has both an acid and a base, making it self-activating.Using the wrong type of flour or sugar, or using them in incorrect proportions, can result in flat, overly raised, or collapsed cakes. Yeast, being a living organism, presents its challenges.The water temperature must be just right—not too hot to kill the yeast, nor too cold to inhibit its activity. Proofing times and conditions also need to be carefully managed to achieve the perfect rise.Bakers should also be careful about the way they mix ingredients. The method of mixing ingredients can significantly impact the final product. Over-mixing can develop too much gluten in cakes and pastries, leading to tough textures.Under-mixing can leave pockets of unincorporated ingredients, resulting in uneven bakes. Techniques like folding, creaming, and whipping each serve specific purposes and must be executed with care.Finally, home bakers must understand the importance of timing and patience in baking. Even a minute or two can make the difference between perfectly baked cookies and burnt edges.Recipes often provide a range for baking times, but factors like oven hot spots, pan material, and altitude can affect these times. It’s crucial to keep a close eye on your bakes and rely on visual and tactile cues, such as a cake pulling away from the sides of the pan or a toothpick coming out clean, to determine doneness.Baking is also an exercise in patience, a virtue not everyone possesses. Doughs need time to rest and rise, flavours need time to meld, and baked goods need time to cool before they can be enjoyed.Impatience can lead to underbaked centres, crumbling slices, and a general sense of frustration. Cultivating patience is as important as mastering any technique in the baker’s repertoire.Home baking is a journey full of ups and downs, but it comes with great rewards. The obstacles encountered teach valuable lessons in patience, precision, and perseverance.The satisfaction of success, the freedom to create, and the therapeutic benefits make the endeavour meaningful. Whether baking for oneself, loved ones, or as an artistic outlet, the journey is as fulfilling as the result. Embrace the flour-dusted countertops, occasional setbacks, and the joys of home bakingFor a beginner-friendly recipe that involves mixing ingredients and delivers amazing results, try my recipe for fudgy, nutty brownies that I call ‘Bliss Brownies’.Bliss Brownies150g unsalted butter plus extra for the tin150g chopped dark chocolate200g caster sugar½ tsp baking powder2 eggs80g cocoa powder150g plain flour70g mixture of nuts (walnuts and almonds)60g blended papayaMix all the ingredients (except the dark chocolate and nuts) in a blender or a food processor and blitz till you get a smooth paste.Fold the chocolate and the nuts into the brownie batter, making sure that the pieces are evenly mixed in.Grease a loaf pan with soft butter and dust with cocoa powder. Pour the batter into the loaf pan.Bake in a preheated oven at 170c for 40 minutes and let it cool in the oven for an hour. Enjoy with a cup of coffee or, as I like it, a scoop of vanilla ice cream. \nOne morning on a fading Tuesday of our vacation, I couldn't shake off the worry that my hard-earned savings from tutoring were slipping away faster than I’d planned. Out of nowhere, I messaged my friend Santona on a whim: ‘A trip to Rara’. With little hope, I awaited her reply, and I have no idea what I’d have done if she had denied it. However, just like the phrase “waiting for the nudge,” she enthusiastically agreed, and soon we roped in our friend, Nirjara.This wasn’t our first trip together—we’d ventured to Pokhara, tried bungee jumping, paragliding, and trekked trails like Khuma and Korchan since our first year of bachelor studies. My idea this time was a well-packaged tour, but plans changed, and new destinations were chosen. The pristine Tilicho Lake became our goal. Without overthinking, I agreed; after all, it’s Nepal and here, no matter where you decide to trek, you’ll experience heaven.From Kathmandu to Manang: Green Lake and apple delightsTravelling to Manang was a meditative experience in itself. As a scout exploring different parts of Nepal, I had often embraced the rush of adventure. But here, by the serene Green Lake under the sun's warm glow, I felt a genuine sense of accomplishment: ‘We’ve finally made it—without getting lost and in the right place.’ We clicked photos, laughed, and even made some silly TikTok videos. The famous apple farms of Manang called out to us with their irresistible offer: a feast of apples for just Rs200. If you’re travelling here, catching the early bus ensures Manang’s charm unfolds entirely by the end of the day.Khangsar to Tilicho Base Camp: rocks and rantsAn early morning jeep ride brought us to Khangsar. The trek was said to take 5-6 hours, but once we started, I moved ahead of my friends, a habit I don’t quite understand. I wondered if my friends would make it before dark. To my relief, their laughter and chatter soon filled the air, joining me.Then we set off into the landslide area, with jagged rocks above hanging like wind chimes ready to fall. We promised not to look up and remained focused on the trail. The journey was filled with everyday conversations from patriarchy to childhood TV shows, and before we knew it, the night wrapped around us as we arrived at the base camp. After some confusion over our booking, we finally settled in, ate quickly, and fell asleep. One tip: keep an eye on your things at Shrikharka—I lost my trekking poles there.Tilicho Lake: A view, a void, and acceptance Morning arrived. We emptied our room and set out, uncertain if we’d return in time and head straight to Shrikharka or stay the night again at base camp. One friend battled altitude sickness but pushed on fiercely, even bargaining for a horse ride, only to find me eventually outpacing it.As I neared the lake, the solitude and distance overwhelmed me. I called my father, who offered only a few comforting words before the line dropped. Thankfully, friends from home Nuya and Shri reached out, and I poured my thoughts to them through tears. With renewed spirit, I moved forward and finally reached a quiet pond that tricked me into thinking I’d arrived. Only after some guidance did I stand before the actual Tilicho Lake.Strangely, I felt no rush of joy. The sight was majestic, yet my reaction fell flat. I asked myself if it was okay to feel so indifferent. However, I accepted that sometimes it’s okay to feel nothing at all. A simple “I don’t know” was all the answers I needed.We had no rooms left on our last night at base camp, so we slept in a dorm, which was a cheaper and warmer option. After dinner, my friends drifted off, but I lingered by the fire, unwilling to leave its comfort. The dining hall was full of trekkers glued to their seats even after finishing their food until a friendly trek guide offered us seats. These guides, cheerful and chatty, shared fun stories and gossip.Ultimately, I want to say to all who recently went trekking, whether funded by parents or your hard-earned savings, to be proud and grateful for the opportunity to explore. And for those who couldn’t go this time, trust that your moment will come. Keep moving forward with hope, knowing that one day, your adventure awaits. \nThe noise of ever-growing traffic, the breaking and mending of black-topped roads, and an ever-expanding concrete jungle are some features that one would associate with the Kathmandu Valley.It is a wildly growing urban forest quickly transforming into a busy metropolis where every inch of space is ready to be sold and built. Yet, pockets of the past remain—small, peaceful neighbourhoods where houses are still made of wood, paths are made of stone tiles, and the stillness of a world that wants to stay intact and immobile. These places are known for tourism, culture, and the restoration of community pride. One such stop is the quiet village of Khokana in southern Lalitpur.Khokana is comparatively close to the mainland urban Lalitpur; from the ring road junction of Bagdole, it takes only a 10-minute drive to reach there. From the airport, you can take a cab directly to Khokana, which will take around half an hour. Get your cameras and hiking boots ready; the area is filled with historical artefacts and hiking trails.However, it is vastly different from the city. It is much nearer to the hills, where stone-paved paths, which could easily be goat trails, are rare in today’s Kathmandu.One such goat trail leads to Sikali temple, a major attraction of the area and accessible only on foot. The pavements are lined with big and small temples on each side, along with ponds that serve as clean water sources and a location for religious rituals. The houses are made of bricks and wood. The concrete invasion, although present, is minimal. Scattered every few hundred metres are small mustard oil mills, co-operative businesses of the locals of Khokana that have existed since medieval times.A site well-recognised for its historical significance, Khokana was even proposed to be made a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1996. Sikali TempleAround an hour’s walk from the historic town, Sikali Temple can be reached, which is also the location for its famed Sikali Jatra.While it can be reached through any public vehicle, a more holistic and adventurous route is to follow the goat trails on the outskirts of Khokana. This route, albeit long, allows for great hiking opportunities, scenic views of the hills surrounding the Kathmandu Valley, and a close-up view of the mediaeval but well-maintained architecture of the local houses.Even if you lose the way, which is very possible, the locals are very welcoming and more than willing to guide you. The main temple itself is three stories tall, and built in the Pagoda style, a common style in many temples in the valley.It is surrounded by a lush grass field which plays the stage to the Sikali Jatra held every year. The temple, like many religious spots around Khokana, is dedicated to the local deity Shree Rudrayani.The Sikali Jatra, a five-day festival that serves as an alternative to Dashain for the Khokana locals, is filled with chariot dances, battle enactments, and storytelling celebrations in the worship of Goddess Rudrayani.Starting from Ghatasthapana in mid to late September, the Jatra is vibrant and an essential experience for every visitor. Historical Khokana townKhokana’s historical town is located around 5 minutes walking distance from the local bus park. The town complex, paved with hand-made stone tiles, is graced with the Indrayanee temple but also has many red-bricked houses built in the local Newari architecture, some of them centuries old.One such house is the ‘Khokana Museum’. Although closed, it is widely popular for being the first house to be lit with electricity in Nepal, as Chandra Shamsher did in 1911.The stand-holder of the first light bulb can still be seen, serving as a historical monument for everyone to see.Similarly, the town complex is also filled with Guthi houses, small ponds, and even the local Ward office. While the Ward office provides a wealth of information for visitors interested in the area’s history, the Guthi halls symbolise the strong community support culture of the locals.The ponds, a notable one present right opposite the Indrayanee temple, have stone taps and remind us of primitive ways of obtaining clean water—a practice many locals are still engaged in.Yet, these ponds are also religious locations, especially used in rituals in the Sikali Jatra.Finally, a stroll through the complex allows visitors to explore old houses and historical artefacts in the serene quietness of Khokana, while the small outlets and Choila places nearby allow you to enjoy the spicy duck or chicken delicacies at the same time.Overall, the historical complex is enough to transport visitors back to a glimpse of the medieval past of the Kathmandu Valley. Mustard oil millsThe most well-known feature of Khokana is its mustard oil mills, which have been operational for hundreds of years and have been using the same methods of preparation since their inception.These mills, scattered throughout Khokana, are often community-owned, and even the ones owned by certain individuals have almost exclusively employed locals.Despite the advent of modern machinery, there is still substantial demand for their products due to the assured guarantee.When I visited one such mill, the local staff informed me that the furnace and oil presser used by them were 300 years old, given by the Patan royalty even before the Shahs became king.In addition to buying pure, organically created mustard oil and pellets, visiting these oil mills offers many educational benefits for international and local tourists alike.Khokana offers visitors a unique glimpse into a preserved bubble of the past through its tranquillity, preservation of ancient lifestyle and cultural elements, and remarkable self-sustenance.  \n“How much oxygen do you have for the summit?”I think this is the kind of question a film producer would ask. But when you're on the mountain, the answer is never clear.I have worked for a long time in the film industry and different art areas, especially photography and engraving.Working in various fields and drawing inspiration from them has become a new normal for me. I have made this approach my way of life without even realising it.I took responsibility for producing the last movie I worked on and shot the behind-the-scenes footage for a documentary. By doing so, I witnessed the entire shooting process and the journey of a movie.In the snowy highlands of Turkey, we had to endure the consequences of the changing climate to shoot ‘About Dry Grasses’, directed by Nuri Bilge Ceylan. The highlands used to be snowy in January, but by the time we got there in the same month, there was no snow. Nature was changing. It was responding to what was happening—to what humanity had done to it. In the end, it snowed, and we shot the intense snow scenes we wanted. But since most of our days were sunny, unlike what the director wanted, we had to shoot in the sunset and sunrise hours. As crew members, we spent many days waiting for the sun to set.Production requires creating opportunities, finding solutions, and being creative for a work of art to come true. For this, patience, endurance, calmness, and timing are necessary. On the other hand, nature wanted us to listen to it and wait for the right time.During that time, I witnessed many of nature's lessons. For example, I experienced extreme cold for the first time. We endured temperatures ranging from -33 degrees to +55 degrees. By listening to nature, surrendering to its forces, and working within its limits, we managed to persevere.No matter how much you prepare or plan during the pre-production phase, if you are working in nature, remember that nature will always have the final say.The film was completed, released, and connected with audiences. Its success at Cannes 2023 was followed by my trip to the North Pole for my project. I returned with a mix of wonderful developments, joys, and challenges. During this process, I experienced life and death, happiness and sadness, losses and awards.I realised the value of being able to breathe comfortably a few days after my father's chemotherapy ended. Just a few days earlier, he had said, \"Well done, my daughter. I'm glad you went!\" All the anxiety and hard work, filled with fears at the beginning, were finally behind me.Before going to Everest, when I was on the verge of giving up, defeated by my fears, I remembered my father's words. Everest reminded me of what he said while struggling to breathe, adding a turning point to my life.What does it mean to say ‘life’s turning point?’ How many turning points can there be in life?Who am I, and what am I doing in this world? How well do I know my own limits? Can I find answers to these big questions? These thoughts sparked my dream of journeying to Everest. Now, after returning, I can say that it turned my life around.“How much oxygen do you need for the summit?” sounds more like “How much do you need to hold on to life?” How many reasons do you find that give meaning to your life, keep you alive, and allow you to breathe? How much can you endure in the face of obstacles, and can you keep believing that a solution will eventually come your way?Can these questions be separated from the idea of measuring and assessing something, from learning its quantity and financial value? Can everything be known with certainty? Should the journey be fully understood in advance, with all its promises laid out? Should it be viewed like a purchase with a price tag, asking, “Is this journey worth this much?”I had never trekked before and had no climbing experience. I had lived at sea level my entire life and had never been to a high altitude.However, this journey was not only about the physical climb but also an inner discovery. After losing my father to lung cancer, his breathing difficulties taught me the fragility of breath, life, and existence. I also mentally prepared myself for the physical challenges I might face. Despite all my concerns, could this journey help me understand the cycle of life and the resilience of the soul?So, how could I make this trek possible? How could I land in Nepal? Despite all the economic difficulties and the many things I felt needed organising, I did my best and believed in it.Since I was embarking on this journey, I felt I should share about my travels and inspire others.Starting with photography, cinema, and engraving, which are already integral parts of my life, I dreamed of documenting and sharing the inspiring aspects of this journey.After months of correspondence and dreaming, it all came true. Finally, I embarked on the journey with the goal of creating photographs, engravings, and documentaries. I learned a great deal from my travels in Nepal, from the people I met, and from every moments I witnessed. I felt incredibly fortunate to have been able to honour my father’s memory with the peace and serenity I experienced in the Himalayas.During my 15-day journey to Everest Base Camp, I encountered nature’s masterpieces at every turn. As concerns like “How will I endure?” and “How will I finish?” started to weigh on me, the mountains suddenly parted with the clouds and gazed down at me.It was amazing to witness the appearance of ‘Gods’ that I had never seen before, in such immense size and in such a close, awe-inspiring manner beside me during that silent walk.As someone who came from one of the most crowded cities in the world, Istanbul, while I struggled with my daily questions and uncertainties, trying to control everything, they stood there calmly, as if answering me.They were just there—before and after.My guide, Lakhpa Sherpa, always reminded me not to worry about how high we were, how long it would take to reach our accommodation, or what the weather would be like. He encouraged me to live in the moment, and he was right.He advised me to focus on my breathing, not to get thirsty, to eat enough, and to appreciate the extraordinary beauty of the journey. In the mountains, plans dissolve and each moment is embraced as it comes.All the good wishes, prayers, and everything encountered along the way were for the journey itself. The mountain was full of life, secrets, and everything I had wondered about.This 15-day journey to Everest Base Camp was a solo adventure, yet I wouldn't have been able to complete it without my guide, Lhakpa, and my porter. Additionally, I was fortunate enough to experience the hospitality, generosity, and honesty at Trekkers Paradise, which organised the entire journey and provided guidance.I witnessed how dedication and sincerity are crucial in completing a journey safely and healthily. Ghanshyam Sharma, from Trekkers Paradise and Sauraj Jhingan, a climber who summited the Everest in 2018, shared their experiences with me during the journey.They experienced the 2015 earthquake while they were at the Everest Base Camp.As a filmmaker, their role as actors, and attention to detail played a significant role in bringing my dream photography and documentary project to life.The sponsors of my journey were Turkish Airlines, The North Face, Apple, Canon, and Stanley. My supporters include Oscar International College and Nepal Film Campus. Throughout the journey, I shared many experiences, memories, and countless photos and images with my students.On my way back home after 21 days, I celebrated my birthday on the plane. From the right window, the Himalayas bid me farewell. I felt like I had opened a new chapter in my life, and I was certain that I would return.I had made many friends and memories in Nepal.For now, I will be working on a documentary and preparing for a photography and engraving exhibition titled ‘My Soul Beyond the Mountain’.To the Himalayas: This summer was spent with you, but we will meet again soon. \nWe spent five days in Sri Lanka two weeks ago, driving up and down the island, covering almost 70 percent of its territory. Our tour spanned over 1,000 kilometres, including hills, beach spots, and heritage and religious sites.Our first stop in Sri Lanka was Colombo’s Bandaranaike International Airport. We were greeted by a warm and humid breeze when we exited the airport. The host briefed us (a group of journalists) that heavy rainfall has affected areas across Sri Lanka since mid-May 2024. Rain and storms intensified on June 1, with the most significant effects in the south and west of the country. We were lucky to have no rain in the forecast.On the first night, we checked into the lavish Jetwing Lake resort, an opulent sanctuary amidst the lush landscape. The resort’s expansive grounds were a retreat, offering a glimpse of Sri Lanka's natural beauty. We feasted on delicious cuisine, every bite exploding with flavour, introducing us to the island’s famed culinary delights. On June 7, early morning, the sun shone brightly, previewing the promise of an incredible journey ahead. We set off early the following day, eager to explore the mysteries of this enchanting island. As we ventured further into the heart of Sri Lanka, the landscape revealed its majestic nature. We were astounded by seeing Pidurangala Rock, a 200-metre-high granite colossus just a kilometre north of Sigiriya. The short hike to Pidurangala Rock offered breathtaking views of Sigiriya and beyond. We climbed the steep steps and soon were rewarded with a breathtaking panoramic view of the surrounding landscape. It took us 30 minutes to climb. The sight took our breaths away and left us humbled in the presence of such grandeur. From the top are glorious vistas of the surrounding landscape and an incredible view of the majestic Sigiriya Rock. From there, Sigiriya Lion’s Rock is visible, standing alone. This was the place where demon king Ravana had his palace in the Treta Yuga. Believed to have been built 50 centuries ago, the palace is said to have had a unique lift for Ravana and his visitors. Ravana imprisoned Sita in one of the caves at the bottom of this humongous boulder. Sigiriya is a fifth-century fortress in Sri Lanka carved out of an inselberg, a hill of hard volcanic rock that soared high above the surrounding jungle. We spent two hours atop the rock, mainly taking photographs. We descended from Pidurangala Rock, filled with awe and a sense of accomplishment.The journey ahead seemed even more enticing as we ventured along the winding roads, heading towards our next destination.Cash-strapped Sri Lanka plunged into its worst financial crisis in more than seven decades in 2022, with a severe dollar shortage sending inflation soaring to a high of 70 percent, its currency to record lows, and its economy contracting 7.3 percent.Thanks to the growing number of tourists, Sri Lanka is now bouncing back.In Jetwing Lake, we met Kasun Pradeep Somasiri, a receptionist. He briefed us that the resort is now 50 percent occupied. “That’s a better figure now as we are recovering.”The travel and tourism sector is a significant income generator for Sri Lanka. However, the economic crisis, the Ukraine–Russia war, and China’s zero-Covid policy have jeopardised the industry.Tourism accounted for more than 12 percent of the country’s GDP in 2019 and was the third-largest source of foreign exchange reserves, behind worker remittances and the apparel industry.Sri Lanka was poised to be one of the world’s best holiday destinations due to its rich culture, wealth of natural resources, and diversity of accessible experiences.However, tourism-dependent Sri Lanka suffered its first major setback with the Easter bombings 2019. This led to the collapse of inbound tourism flows as international arrivals declined by 18 percent year-on-year, and tourist expenditure fell by 17.7 percent that year. This was immediately followed by two years of pandemic restrictions. Inbound visitors fell to just 116,600 in 2021.An acute balance of payments crisis forced Sri Lanka to preemptively default on foreign debt of over $50 billion in April 2022, triggering a crippling economic contraction with spiralling inflation.“Tourism is gaining momentum,” says Somasiri. “The British and Chinese have started to return to Sri Lanka.”January-August is the peak season for foreigners. “From December to April, local people travel for holiday purposes,” says Somasiri. Before we started the tour to other religious sites, our tour guide, Sampath Mayadunne, told us, “Don't take selfies with your back to Buddha.” Turning your back on a Buddha statue and some other religious sites to take photos and videos is a strict no-no.The most common sight across Sri Lanka is the tank cascades system, an ancient irrigation infrastructure. The system is a network of small tanks draining to large reservoirs that store rainwater and surface runoff for later use.“These infrastructures were built by its ancient kings over 2,000 years ago to solve the water scarcity in the country’s dry zone,” says Mayadunne.On day two, we travelled to Ranweli Spice Garden in Matale. This garden is famous for its rare spices and herbs. A tour of the gardens will show you the cultivation, harvesting, cleaning, and packaging process, as well as the health benefits and uses of the herbs.On the way, we saw a colourful Muthumariamman Hindu temple, boasting hundreds of detailed sculptures in a rich mosaic of colour.In Kandy, we visited the Temple of the Tooth Relic (Sri Dalada Maligawa), one of the most sacred places of worship in the Buddhist world. It was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1988.The temple sustained damage from bombings by Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna in 1989 and by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam in 1998. However, it was fully restored each time.We then headed to Jetwing St Andrew’s, a luxurious 5-star property in Sri Lanka’s hill country of Nuwara Eliya, situated at 1,900 metres above sea level. During our stay in Kandy, we immersed ourselves in the city's charm and the serenity of the countryside. On the third day, early morning, we travelled to Nuwara Eliya, the area famous for tea estates that give many Nepalis the feeling that they have come to Kanyam, Ilam, in eastern Nepal.We visited a tea factory called Damro Labookellie Tea Centre, the oldest tea centre in Sri Lanka. Due to its cold climate, it is the most important area for tea production in Sri Lanka.In this tea factory, they make white and black tea, while the green tea is processed in another tea factory and then sent to Damro.After the tea factory tour and the tea tasting, we headed to Galle, our next resting point.We encountered narrow, winding, and maze-like streets and alleys in Nuwara Eliya, known as ‘Little England’. The town has preserved almost all its British-era buildings and is calm and beautiful. On our way to Galle, at the roadside, our tour guide stopped us at the famed Sita temple, which has Hanuman's footprints and is the place where Sita, wife of Lord Rama, was held captive by the demon king Ravana after he abducted her from India.We were at Sita Eliya, a temple named Sri Seethai Amman.When we reached the Hindu temple, rich in vibrant colours and architectural elements, it was full of devotees. The water stream adjoining the temple is believed to be where Sita bathed. Large footprints are found on the stones in the stream, and there is a saying that those belong to Hanuman, who came spying to find Sita’s whereabouts.In Ella, Ravana’s waterfalls are significant in the Rama-Ravana story. The cascade charms visitors from all over the globe. The waterfall is easily accessible and is known to have hidden caves at the top, which are believed to have been used as Ravana's residence.The 25-metre-tall waterfall is a beautiful cascade that provides the perfect backdrop for a photo to remember your Ramayana trail adventures in Sri Lanka. A short pilgrimage tour ended there, and it was now time for an adventure. Though it was not part of our itinerary, our guide decided to tour us on a train ride.Though short, only six kilometres from Ella to Demodera, it was thrilling. Everyone screamed in unison like kids on a fair ride to hear the echoes in the dark every time we passed through the tunnels. The sound of the train is subtly different inside a tunnel. For the first-timer, the darkness and shouts inside the tunnels when the train passes would be scary, like a horror movie.The train we boarded wasn’t crowded, but people had already filled the doorway, ready for the scenic journey.With the shrill sound of a whistle, the train slowly pulled away from the platform at Ella, passing houses, coconut trees and green fields.As the train progressed, tourists and locals were leaning out the windows and crowding to hang out the doors. I joined the crowd and hung out on a train. A short excitement ended there.After lunch, we headed to Galle and reached Jetwing Lighthouse. As soon as our group entered the hotel, they shouted with excitement.The hotel is on a rocky outcrop three miles west of Galle. Waves crash over giant boulders in front of it and produce howling winds.We were at Galle’s 17th-century fort five minutes from the hotel on day four. In the Bay of Galle on the southwest coast of Sri Lanka, Galle Fort was built first in 1588 by the Portuguese and lavishly rebuilt by the Dutch during the 17th century. It is a historical, archaeological and architectural heritage monument that maintains a perfect appearance even after more than 436 years.We then reached Hikkaduwa Beach, a popular beach destination on the southern coast of Sri Lanka. On the way, we saw a 30-metre-high Big Buddha Statue. It is a replica of the 6th-century Buddhas of Bamiyan destroyed by the Taliban in Afghanistan. It was created using the earliest known sketches of the statue. It was built in remembrance of the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami victims.We then travelled through the 222-kilometre-long Southern Expressway, Sri Lanka's first expressway linking the capital, Colombo, with Galle, Matara, and Hambantota, significant cities south of the island.On day five, we reached Colombo, the capital of Sri Lanka. Jetwing Colombo Seven hosted us in the bustling capital. We took a city tour early morning and visited Bally's Casino at night.On day six, we returned to Kathmandu early in the morning on a Sri Lankan Airlines flight, the airline that organised the trip in coordination with Jetwing Hotels Limited, a Sri Lankan hotel chain.National flag carrier Nepal Airlines, in its previous avatar as Royal Nepal Airlines, used to operate direct flights to Colombo during the 1980s. However, the carrier suspended operations following an armed movement by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) in Sri Lanka. There had been no direct air links between the two countries for decades.In 2016, Himalaya Airlines started a chartered flight that lasted a few months due to low traffic movement between the two countries. Sri Lankan Airlines started operating direct flights to Kathmandu in August 2021.“The main objective of this media tour is to increase tourism in both countries for mutual benefit. We want to draw Nepalis for pilgrims and leisure activities,” says Nilina Pathirana, Country Manager at Srilankan Airlines in Nepal.“We have understood that Nepali travellers tend to travel to Bangkok, Vietnam, Malaysia, Dubai, and Maldives. Nepalis have quite minimal knowledge about Sri Lanka and the religious connection between Lanka and Nepal. We want to promote Nepal and Sri Lanka jointly. This will be a win-win business,” added Pathirana.The airline said it currently carries 60 percent of the passengers from Nepal to Sri Lanka and beyond destinations like Tokyo, Sydney, Melbourne, and other Middle Eastern destinations. The return airfare for a 3.5-hour-long flight starts at Rs74,000. “We have a four-night, five-day package that begins from Rs80,000, depending on the properties and extended itineraries,” says Pathirana.Nepalis must submit certain required documents for visa processing, like their passport copy and bank statement. Due to this government-to-government policy, only Nepalis must obtain a prior visa. Otherwise, Sri Lankans are required to have a visa upon arrival.“The other best thing is that Sri Lankan Airlines can be involved with the visa process or facilitate the Nepalis tourists. Our main intention is to have a sustainable market in Kathmandu and make it a daily flight,” says Pathirana. \nMundhum Trek in Koshi province in the eastern part of Nepal is a new cultural walking trail. It passes through several indigenous ethnic villages and landscapes in Khotang and Bhojpur districts. This trail goes up to an elevation of 4,200 metres to the viewpoint of Silchung Peak and takes one through the settlements of the Kirati people. This route starts from Diktel Bazaar and passes through beautiful settlements like Chakhewa, Rawa Dhap, Salpa Bhanjyang, Silchung and Hanspokhari before ending in Bhojpur. There are some hotels in Diktel but trekkers are advised to carry tents. The trail offers panoramic views of most of the eight-thousanders, including Everest, Lhotse, Makalu, Cho Oyu and Kanchenjunga mountains. The spring season, March through May, is highly recommended for the trek.Janaki Mandir Janaki Mandir at Janakpur in Madhesh province was constructed in 1874 and is a blend of Mughal and local architecture. The temple is a three-storey building and has 60 rooms, making it the largest temple in Nepal. Pilgrims flock here by the thousands to pay homage to Janaki Mandir—Janaki being the other name of Sita, the daughter of King Janak. The temple houses an idol of Sita which was found near Ayodhya, the kingdom of Ram. The marriage anniversary of Lord Ram and Sita is celebrated in Janakpur every year on Vivaha Panchami, which falls in December. In the southwest corner of Janaki Mandir is the Vivaha Mandap, which has been built at the site where the marriage of Ram and Sita is said to have taken place. Another well-known temple in the vicinity is Ram Mandir, which is built in pagoda style and is hence different from the other temples in Janakpur that generally bear resemblance to Mughal architecture. It houses a female statue, said to be of Yogamaya, which has the reputation of being one of the most beautiful images of female forms in Nepal. Other holy sites of interest include the Laxman Temple, Sankat Mochan Temple and Hanuman Temple.Kuri Village, Kalinchok Kuri village, a popular tourist destination around 150 km from Kathmandu, lies at an altitude of 3,842 metres above sea level in Kalinchowk of Dolakha district, in Bagmati province. People visit the place to enjoy the snow during the winter besides the mesmerising landscapes and splendid panoramic view of the Himalayan range. Kalinchok gets snow mainly at the end of December and the snowfall continues till the end of February or mid-March. When there is snow, it is difficult for jeeps, buses and cars to reach the top of Kuri village. Chains are wrapped around the wheels of vehicles and specially modified jeeps with highly experienced drivers are used to carry visitors. There are several hotels and restaurants in the area. The road up to Kuri has also improved over the years.Annapurna Base Camp Annapurna Base Camp trek, in Gandaki province, makes for a picturesque journey that takes you to the foothills of the Annapurna South, up to 4,130 metres above sea level. The five-day trek (seven days for slow walkers) offers rich cultural diversities, typical Nepali villages and the flora and fauna nestled at the foothills of Annapurna. The distance from Pokhara to Annapurna Base Camp is approximately 81 kilometres. It is among the shortest and most budget-friendly treks in Nepal. For Nepalis, lodging costs around $5 to $10 per day. For foreigners, the overall cost of the trek ranges from $800 to $1500 on average per person. Annapurna Base Camp trek can be done at any time throughout the year as each season offers a different trekking experience. The ideal time for the trek depends on your weather preferences and what you expect from it. However, autumn (September to October) and spring (March to May) are considered the two best seasons for the trek, as the days at the time are warm and bright with clear skies.Bardiya National Park Bardiya National Park, located in the southern Tarai belt of Lumbini province, is home to one of the most elusive and majestic animals on earth—the Royal Bengal Tiger. The park, which covers an area of 968 square kilometres, is considered one of the most important protected areas in the country. It is a prime destination for those looking to catch a glimpse of a tiger. A bit of luck and patience will offer a good chance to see the Bengal Tiger. The jungle safari also offers one the opportunity to spot Asian elephants and the greater one-horned rhinoceros. The rare Gangetic river dolphins are occasionally spotted on rafting trips along the Geruwa River, the eastern channel of the Karnali river. Besides, visitors can enjoy the homestays and explore local Tharu culture. The right time to visit the park is from mid-September to mid-December and mid-February to May.Khaptad National Park Khaptad National Park in Sudurpaschim province is a protected area in the far western region. It stretches over four districts of Bajhang, Bajura, Achham and Doti and ranges in elevation from 1,400 to 3,300 metres. The park can be visited throughout the year. Trekkers are advised to bring their tents, food and other supplies. The Nepal Tourism Board says of late, social media has been increasingly influencing Nepali travellers to go to Khaptad. Since the far-flung Khaptad National Park is still offbeat for many travellers, the area remains pristine and fresh. The seasons of spring (March-May) and autumn (October-November) are the ideal times to visit the park. The temperature ranges from 10°c to 20°c offering pleasant trekking weather. The monsoon begins in June and lasts until September and during this time, roads often become muddy and slippery. From December to February, winter brings snow and chilling winds to the park.Limi Valley \nAiden Markram was 19 runs short of a test century at lunch on Friday as South Africa reached 180-5 on the second day of the first test in reply to Pakistan’s first innings total of 211.Markram has been under pressure after a series of low scores for South Africa but showed his value to the team with chanceless knock that left South Africa 31 runs in arrears with five wickets in hand at Centurion.He will resume on 81 with Kyle Verreynne (0 not out) after lunch, looking to build a lead for the hosts as they chase the win that would assure them a place in next June’s World Test Championship final.But two wickets for Pakistan in Friday’s morning session kept them firmly in the contest with both captain Temba Bavuma and David Bedingham dismissed in the first session.South Africa were 82-3 overnight with Markram and Bavuma putting on a further 54 runs before the skipper was dismissed, offering a thick outside edge to a delivery from Aamer Jamal and was caught behind for 31.Bedingham was characteristically attacking in his short spell at the crease, scoring 30 runs off 33 balls before extra bounce from Naseem Shah saw him edge to Kamran Ghulam in the slips.Markram was 47 overnight and moved quickly past 50 runs in the third over of the morning as Pakistan toiled for the first hour before they made their breakthrough.South Africa need to win one of the two-match series against Pakistan to reach the WTC final at Lord’s in June, adding extra pressure to the contest.They have won their last seven home tests against Pakistan. \nLocal pro Niraj Tamang extended the lead to seven strokes after the second round of the Surya Nepal Eastern Open, the third event under the Surya Nepal Golf Tour 2024-25, at the par-70 Dharan Golf Club on Thursday.Tamang carded 4-under 66 in the second round to post a 36-hole total of 12-under 128.

Obviously, a big, strong guy as well, so one of the guys who can hit the deck hard.\"And he obviously offers a role with the bat as well. We saw in the ODI that he can hold his own with the bat. We're excited for him to see what he can do with the red ball and strengthen our bowling line-up,\" added the South Africa captain.Chasing WinThe all-pace attack means frontline spinner Keshav Maharaj sits out. \"I think it's no different to what we've generally gone with.

At least 38 people were killed while 29 survived.“After the bang...I thought the plane was going to fall apart,” Subhonkul Rakhimov, one of the passengers, told Reuters from hospital.He said he had begun to recite prayers and prepare for the end after hearing the bang.“It was obvious that the plane had been damaged in some way,” he said. “It was as if it was drunk - not the same plane anymore.”Another passenger on the plane told Reuters that she also heard a loud bang.Survivors of the Azerbaijan Airlines plane crash share harrowing stories“After the bang...I thought the plane was going to fall apart,” Subhonkul Rakhimov, one of the passengers, told Reuters from hospital.He said he had begun to recite prayers and prepare for the end after hearing the bang.“It was obvious that the plane had been damaged in some way,” he said. “It was as if it was drunk - not the same plane anymore.”Another passenger on the plane told Reuters that she also heard a loud bang.“I was very scared,” said Vafa Shabanova, adding that there was also a second bang.She was then told by a flight attendant to move to the back of the plane.Both passengers said there appeared to be a problem with the oxygen levels in the cabin after the bang.Beyond the horror of the crash, the first-person narratives from the passengers gives an insight into what may have caused the disaster.Azerbaijan Airlines suspended a host of flights to Russian cities on Friday and said it considered the crash was caused by what it termed “physical and technical external interference”. It did not detail what that interference was.Four sources with knowledge of the preliminary findings of Azerbaijan’s investigation into the disaster told Reuters on Thursday that Russian air defences had mistakenly shot it down.Russia has said it is important to wait for the official investigation to finish its work to understand what happened.DRONE WARThe Embraer (EMBR3.SA) passenger jet had flown from Azerbaijan’s capital Baku to Grozny, in Russia’s southern Chechnya region, before veering off hundreds of miles across the Caspian Sea.It crashed on the opposite shore of the Caspian after what Russia’s aviation watchdog said was an emergency that a bird strike may have caused.Footage shot by passengers on the plane before it crashed showed oxygen masks down and people wearing life vests. Later footage showed bloodied and bruised passengers climbing out of the plane.After the turmoil of the crash landing, there was silence before the moaning of the injured began, Rakhimov said.The crash has underscored the risks to civil aviation even when they are flying hundreds of miles from a war zone, especially when a major drone war is underway.The Azerbaijan Airlines plane got into trouble near Grozny which is more than 850 km (530 miles) from the front lines in Ukraine, but still a repeated target for Ukrainian drones which have struck far behind Russian lines.Russia uses advanced electronic jamming equipment to confuse Ukrainian drone location and communication systems and a large number of air defence systems to shoot down the drones.Since Russia send thousands of troops into Ukraine in 2022, airlines have flown around Ukraine and Russia has closed major airports in southwestern Russia.Russia’s aviation watchdog said on Friday the plane had decided to reroute from its original destination in Chechnya amid dense fog and a local alert over Ukrainian drones.Rosaviatsia said that the captain had been offered other airports at which to land, but had chosen Kazakhstan’s Aktau. It said that it would provide comprehensive support to Kazakh and Azerbaijani investigations looking into the crash.Asked about reports that Russian air defences had mistakenly shot down the aircraft, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Friday he had nothing to add and did not want to give any assessments until the official investigation made its conclusions. \nChaaaiiittt…The spontaneous eruption of the sound of victory thundered through the neighbourhood of Nhyokha in the Kathmandu core. The line of a kite cut another. Looking out the window of her house, Sajani Shrestha saw children running full speed, shouting and fighting as they vied to catch the falling kite and thread. And craning her neck up to the sky, she could not count but only be mesmerised by the innumerable kites strewn across the skies of Nhyokha, Bangemudha, Indrachowk. “There would be so many kites that they entirely covered the blue of the sky, making beautiful patterns of different colours,” says the 51-year-old. “And you cannot imagine the number of times the call of chait rang in the air.”Clear blue sky and gentle westerlies, the season of kites has arrived in the Kathmandu Valley. While kites soared Kathmandu's sky mainly during Dashain, the kite season officially started in Nag Panchami (August) and ended on the Haribodhini Ekadashi (November). And from royalities to commoners, young and old all flew kites from rooftops and open grounds. Even those who did not, like Sajani, revelled in the live spectacle in the sky as kites soared and fought. With Bhimsen Thapa’s help, King Girvanyuddha flies kites The earliest written account of kite flying is believed to date to 200 BC in China. In Kathmandu, this tradition has religious and socio-cultural and environmental significance, says Tina Manandhar, lecturer of Nepalese History, Culture and Archaeology at Tribhuvan University. According to her, it is believed that kites in Kathmandu skies carry a message to the god of rain Indra that the valley's farmers have had enough rain for their crops. That is why Kathmandu farmers scolded anyone flying kites before plantation season.In an article ‘Changako Utpati Ra Bikas’ published in Gorkhapatra in 1995, historian Rajesh Gautam points to the lack of written documents indicating the exact time when kite culture was introduced in Nepal. Exploring different opinions on kite's introduction to Nepal, he writes that “some have opined the possibility that the skill and tradition of kite flying might have entered Nepal through India.” Yet some others, he writes, state that kites “came to Nepal from Japan during the time of [Rana PM] Dev Shumsher.”He concludes that most likely this tradition was introduced by Malla-era Newar traders: “But since Nepal’s relationship with Tibet and China is very old and direct, kites might have entered Nepal through the Newar traders who were engaged in the trade. One can estimate that the kite was introduced to Nepal during the (mediaeval) Malla regime.”In Social History of Nepal, TR Vaidya, Tri Ratna Manandhar and Shankar Lal Joshi write that there exists documented evidence of the kite flying from the early 19th century. The authors state that Sundarananda, a contemporary poet, has mentioned that the young king Girvanyuddha Bikram Shah (r.1799-1816), with the help of Prime Minister Bhimsen Thapa, flew kites from the towering temple of Taleju Bhawani, Hanumandhoka. And when the king's kite cut the kites of the youngsters, they were located and rewarded with money.In Tyas Bakhatko Nepal, Sardar Bhim Bahadur Pandey states that “During the month of Kartik [October-November] young and old all flew kites,” suggesting that kite culture was ubiquitous in Kathmandu by the early twentieth century.Anticipations and preparationsKite flying in Nepal requires a kite, a lattai (a wooden spool), thread and majha (homemade adhesive prepared by boiling snail slime, rice or sago, and powdered glass from burnt electric bulbs and coated on the line to sharpen it for kite fighting).77-year-old Nirmal Man Tuladhar, an avid kite flyer and retired professor of Linguistics at the Tribhuvan University, explains how Nepali tradition of kite flying was both expensive and needing advance preparation.“In our times, it wasn’t easy to fly kites,” he says. “We had to prepare majha …And as Nepali kites are fighter kites, we mainly fought with other kites [which meant we spent a lot of threads].”This preparation needed first and foremost of passing a hurdle: securing finances and materials to fly kites. While lattai was a one-time investment that could be saved for years, kites and threads had to be replenished every time a kite was cut.“Those were the times when parents wanted us to be more focused in our studies. They only gave money [to buy kites] after immense pestering,” says 80-year-old Dwarika Nath Dhungel, former Secretary of Nepal government, speaking of the 1950s and 1960s.Biodiversity specialist and botanist Tirtha Bahadur Shrestha, 86, was born in Mahabouddha and began flying kites from 1951-52. He saved what little money he got for afternoon snacks to buy Hattimar reel, a brand of line wound in a small lattai, which was strong and sharp and where majha stuck well.Raghuji Pant, a member of parliament, also recalls the difficulty in securing money to sustain his kite flying in and around Kathmandu core in the 1960s and early 1970s. “Four to five of my kites were cut in a day,” writes the 67-year-old in his 2019 article “Changa Jastai Udi Hidne Man” published in Himalkhabar. “[This caused] the line in the spool to shorten. From Bhadra [August-September] to one to one and a half months after Dashain I spent flying kites. So, it was difficult for me to have enough kites even after getting money from grandfather, grandmother, mother and everyone.”Kites and thread secured, now began the crucial work of preparing and applying majha whose strength determined how well it cut other kites. Govinda Tandon, 70, a historian and heritage expert, who grew up in Battisputali, was also an ardent kite flyer.“Materials for making majha were prepared right from the morning on a holiday,\" he writes in his article “Dashainko Butte Changa” published in Gorkhapatra. “Because this work couldn’t be accomplished without a collaboration of 3-4 friends, a holiday was set aside for this. Moreover, a sunny day was considered appropriate. If the majha didn’t dry, the thread could turn moist, and so if it felt like the day wouldn’t be sunny, the entire plan…was aborted.”Kite makers, kite sellers and variety of kites One of the oldest shops in Kathmandu's memory, Shree Chitrakar Kite Center in Tyauda, Asan is bustling with customers during Dashain. “When my grandmother got married and came to this house at age 12 [in early 1940s], this shop was already here,” says its fourth generation owner 47-year-old Dinoj Chitrakar. “So the shop must be around a hundred years old.”Another shop that stands out in Kathmandu's memory is Manandhar Kite Center in Kalimati, established in 1949, and currently run by brothers Mohan Man and Sundar Man Manandhar.In his book Antar Taranga, artist and writer Manuj Babu Mishra recalls “a kite shop near the old halwai shop of Chabahil” in the 1940s. Dhungel and his 1960 batchmates of Juddhodaya Public School recall the kite shops from the 1950s and 1960s – Bekhacha’s Shop at Netapacho, Bhaicha’s Shop at Nhyokha, Lata Manandhar’s Shop at Maru, Kanchha Buddha Bajracharya Shop at Tyauda.Besides the shops, there were makers and sellers of kites cloistered in different localities of Kathmandu Valley.In Kwalkhu, Patan was a Joshi who made Nepali paper kites.“One day I accompanied my uncle to buy kites,\" writes Dibya Giri, 69, in his 2023 article “Changa” in Sahitya Post. “I was amazed to see the huge stacks of kites there. We used to call it the house of the kite maker.”In Nhyokha, Purna Bahadur Shrestha began making kites as a teenager and started his own kite business in the 1950s, according to his daughter Sajani.These kites, made out of Nepali paper, often had different paintings. Mishra recalls painting kites for the kite shop in Chabahil.“I went to that kite shop and with the freely available colours and Nepali papers, I spent my day painting faces, birds, animals, masks, mountains, hills, whatever came to my mind,” he writes in the book. “Such kites apparently sold well!”Most septuagenarians and older generations like Tuladhar and Tirtha Bahadur recall flying kites made of Nepali paper when young. Tirtha Bahadur says that kites from Lucknow began coming to Kathmandu only after the late 1950s. But at least a section of Kathmandu was flying kites from Lucknow from the early twentieth century. Vaidya, Manandhar and Joshi write that the Ranas and Shahs imported kites from Lucknow and that from them, their favourite employees also got to fly some. These kites were large and, in Tyas Bakhatko Nepal, Pande writes that they were referred to as Lucknowia kites.Known for their characteristic hissing sound they made while flying, light body, swift movement and ability to take sharp turns, Lucknow kites were preferred by kite fighters.“Lucknow kites were lighter and could be manoeuvred well,” says Tuladhar. “Kites of Nepali paper were stable but difficult to manoeuvre. They were also expensive. So only some fighters flew Nepali paper kites.”The kites had different names depending upon their designs and colours – Ambe (a heart in the centre), Dibdibe (chequered), Pakhete (a different coloured paper on one edge), Sete (white-coloured), Nilchi (blue-coloured), Rate (red-coloured) and so on.The kite fighters preferred the strong and sharp Hattimar reel that came on a small lattai. The Belchamar reel was cheaper but weaker and prone to be cut by other threads. Kite fliers and kite watchers on rooftops and open groundsBibek Shrestha, 57, and his two brothers took stacks of kites and climbed their rooftops. The rooftops around theirs in the neighbourhood of Nhyokha – in fact in all core settlements of the Valley – were filled with kite fliers and spectators. Many risked precariously balancing on the sloped roofs.While Bibek and his brothers’ kites alighted to meet the sea of kites in the sky, their sister Sajani and other family members gathered around to revel in the live spectacle.Dhungel remembers the rooftops of Jhochhen and surroundings of the 1950s and 1960s swelled with kite fliers. Dhungel did try to fly kites. But he did not become a successful kite flyer. What he did become was, like Sajani and many Kathmandu residents, an admirer of kites soaring in the sky.“But more than engaging in my unsuccessful kite flying attempts, I enjoyed looking at the kites flying. There would be a big crowd of spectators. Females and other family members watched the kites fly as they ate meat and chiura. Some even drank and rejoiced as they flew kites.”When the age of cassette player and speakers dawned in the 1980s, songs blared from the speakers alongside kite flying. Chitrakar and Bibek invited their friends, put their favourite songs on speakers and spent entire afternoons flying kites, dancing, singing and eating.Away from the core cities, in the villages in the Valley, people flew kites in open fields. Like Dibya, who set his kite for flight from the banks of Godavari River in Tikathali. Chhauni was also a popular space for flying kites.Kathmandu’s joy in kite fightingBibek pulled his kite down and then manoeuvred it back up so his line touched his opponent's line from below and quickly reeled out his line. The resulting sharpness from the speed cut the opponent's line.Chaaaiiitttt………“The greatest fun comes from cutting another kite's string,” writes Tuladhar in his 1996 article “Cutting is the greatest fun” published in magazine Kite Lines. “With its coating of adhesive paste and ground glass, the string is as sharp and abrasive as sandpaper on your opponent's line.”Nepali kite, Tuladhar says, is made to fight other kites, and describes how a kite line cuts the other.“The technique is to touch your rival's string and immediately reel out line at high speed,” he writes. “The Nepalese style of kite flying is aggressive, and though the kites look simple, they are strategically designed for bringing down other kites.”At any given time, like Bibek’s kite above Nhyokha sky, skies above the Valley were filled with raging kites, swinging, coming down and going up as the fighters reeled in and out their lattais in ferocious attempts to bring down other kites.Meanwhile spectators cheered. “Even passersby stopped to look at the kites,” recalls Tina.The moment of a kite cutting was accompanied by the sound of chait, and children ran in the direction of the falling kite to grab it and the thread in what was termed as, Dibya says, changa lutne/dhago lutne.Dhungel always joined in to shout the chait resounding through the locality of Jhochhen and almost automatically his feet sped towards the severed kites' direction.“‘Oii leave that thread,’ the kite owner would scold me. ‘Why do you pull my thread, leave it right now.’ But I’d continue pulling the threads as the owner continued shouting. Other times I caught the kites that had failed to fly and dropped on the ground.”The fallen kites got stuck in the buildings, trees or poles, or glided down in the open grounds or paddy fields. Falling kites from the Kathmandu core settled down in Tundikhel covering it. Oftentimes kites fell on the fields to rest upon the lush paddy nearing its harvest.“Children ran straight into the fields to catch the kite,” says Dibya. \"They destroyed the crops by stepping on them. Some farmers chased them, scolding along as they did so and if they caught anyone, they slapped them.”Love and restrictions on kiteAmidst the raging kite fights high up in the sky, there were apparently also some quieter kites lingering much lower among the buildings or tree lines, for their goals lay in not ruthlessly cutting the threads of other kites but piercing softly through the hearts of their owners' love interests. During the Rana regime, there were designated public spaces to fly kites, writes Gautam in his article. Referring to oral accounts, he writes that the Ranas were particularly careful to avoid kite flyers around their durbars. This is because love-stricken men tied letters to kites and flew them into the durbars to their love interests among the nanis.He writes that the kites could be flown mainly on the grounds of Chhauni. Anyone flying kites in any other place and around Rana durbars were arrested.Pant also recalls love-stricken boys from his time. “Just as kites came in different colours and patterns, so did kite flyers,” he writes in the article. “Some wrote love letters using a few words in “symbolic language” on a plain kite and attempted to land it on the rooftop of the girl they liked. Some simply landed their kites on any rooftop if a girl appeared there and waited for reaction.”King Tribhuvan among kite fliersPande writes in his book: “Once or twice during kite season every year, King Tribhuvan went to Chhauni to fly kites. Legend has it that if the line of the king’s kite was cut, it flew to Lhasa. But since anyone who caught that kite received five rupees, everyone attempted to catch that kite.”In 2021 news report ‘Bhawanle Chhekidiyo Changa Udaune Aakash’ by Shivahari Ghimire published in Nayapatrika, cultural expert the late Satyamohan Joshi also recounts that “During Dashain, Tribhuvan came to the ground below Swayambhu to fly kites. […] He did not use the same thread to fly kites twice.”In the same article, Joshi says that the King also went to Budhanilakantha to fly kites and participate in kite flying competitions.End of season, end of cultureMohan Krishna Shrestha, 86, was born in Budhanilakantha. Every year, on the day of Haribodhini Ekadashi, he saw the annual fair at the Budhanilakantha Temple. He also witnessed kite fliers gathered in the open fields around the Temple.“Oh, it’d be a lot of people,” says Shrestha. “They came from all around Bhaktapur, Kathmandu and Lalitpur.”They flew kites on Ekadashi, Dwadashi and some even until Purnima.“They took all the remaining threads and kites that had survived Dashain and flew the last kites of the season,” says Tuladhar. “I remember my uncles, relatives and neighbours going to Budhanilakantha with their kites.”Joshi recalls in the 2021 article that King Tribhuvan also went to Budhanilakantha with his sons Mahendra, Himalaya and Basundhara. He greatly supported and also participated in the competitions there organised by the commoners. If he liked he gave prize money to the winners.This annual event lost its glory days after the decline in the open fields as buildings began to rise with the establishment of Budhanilkantha School in 1972, Mohan says.“The event survived in some form until the 1990s,” he says.But what happened after that?The end-of-the-season event in the 1990s was also an indication of the end of the age-old kite tradition.“If I go to my ancestral place in Asan to fly kites, it’s not possible for me to do that today because there are buildings everywhere,” says Tuladhar. “Cityscapes and urbanisation have created the obstacle for flying kites.”Dibya does feel like flying kites sometimes.“No space to fly kites today,” he says. “In the old times, there were river banks and open fields. Even if you fly kites, it gets stuck in somebody's rooftop or water tank or somewhere.”Yesteryear’s kite enthusiasts believe that increasing means of entertainment was another reason for the decline of kite culture.“When television came, kite flying started to slowly decrease,” says Bibek. “And then mobile phones robbed kite flying even more.”And so, when his sister Sajani cranes her neck up in the sky today, she rarely sees a kite.“Those days we heard one chait after another,” she says. “These days you won’t hear a single chait.” \nIn 2008 Matina Shakya was only three years old when she was appointed as the Kumari of Kathmandu. She was succeeded by Trishna Shakya as the new Kumari in 2017.Kumaris are revered as goddesses of beauty and strength in certain Hindu and Buddhist traditions. Worshipping young girls as Kumaris is a 2,000-year-old practice in Nepal. Since the 13th century, when the Malla kings ruled, the Newars of the Kathmandu Valley have been worshipping Kumari, a girl from the Shakya/Bajracharya community chosen to embody the divine energy of goddess Taleju Bhawani. The reign of a Kumari ends when she starts menstruating. So long as she is serving as the Kumari, she is believed to be the nation’s divine protector, safeguarding it from evil. Matina, 18, is now in her first year of college, studying for a bachelor’s degree in management. Her father, Pratapman Shakya, when asked about having a daughter who is the only living the goddess in the world said, “Not having your own daughter live in the same house as you seemed a little unfair, but we feel very proud to call ourselves the parents of the royal Kumari who is revered by people all over the world.”On March 9, 2023, he, along with Matina, were getting ready for a special function held to honour all former Kumaris from across Nepal. “There are often events to honour Matina as she was the royal Kumari, but this one was dedicated to all former Kumaris from different areas. There are 129 living Kumaris in all,” he added. Besides Kathmandu, Kumari tradition is followed in Bhaktapur, Lalitpur, and Kirtipur, among other cities.According to him, this was the first time an event like this was organised and the Deputy Mayor of Kathmandu, Sunita Dangol, was also in attendance.Throughout the year, many people line up outside the ‘Kumari Ghar’ to get a chance to visit the Kumari and get her blessings. Many foreigners stand out in the yard to catch a glimpse of her. Nepali people believe that if a Kumari smiles at you, it is a bad omen.Everyday, a tutor visits the Kumari to help her continue with her education as she is not allowed to step outside the Kumari Ghar. She takes her exams and does her homework from the Kumari Ghar itself. She also has the freedom to play inside the Kumari Ghar. Many former kumaris have pursued careers in their fields of interest or studied after their term ends, and they continue to be treated with the same respect. The tradition of Kumari has evolved over time. In the past Kumaris did not enjoy these freedoms.Because of various superstitious beliefs, Kumaris were not fully educated and were forbidden from getting married because of the belief that the groom would die soon if he married an ex-Kumari. They led secluded lives, were restricted from participating in normal childhood activities, and focused solely on their religious duties.However, now, these myths have been dispelled. Modern understanding has shifted to recognise that Kumaris, after stepping down from their divine role, have the freedom to marry and lead a normal life. The perception of Kumaris as isolated figures has evolved, with a focus on providing them with a more balanced upbringing. There have been initiatives to integrate Kumaris into regular social and educational settings, allowing them to have a more holistic and fulfilling childhood experience. “Matina was already familiar with the students from the school that she attended after her term as Kumari ended,” said Shakya. “The kids visited the Kumari Ghar frequently so that she could have a smooth transition,” he added. According to Gautam Prasad Shakya, who has been living as a caretaker in the Kumari Ghar, the changes made to the tradition are minor. “The traditions of Kumari have mostly stayed the same. All the rituals are still practised like in the old days,” he said.On 6 May 2005, Pun Devi Maharjan, a lawyer, filed a case in the Supreme Court claiming that the traditional practice of electing young girls as Kumaris, or “goddesses’, who are expected to follow certain social restrictions and appear at religious festivals, violated the rights of the child. Quoting Maharjan’s complaint, Puskar Mathema writes in Yuwamanch Monthly of October 2007, “If Kumari tradition is continued, it will undermine the fundamental rights as well the freedoms of children guaranteed by the constitution and child rights treaties. Apart from this, it will have a negative impact on their physical and mental development.”The case continued while Nepal overthrew the monarchy and declared itself a secular state in 2007. When the judgement was pronounced in 2008, the goddess was still in her role, now giving blessings to the country’s President. The court ordered that the Kumaris and ex-Kumaris receive better benefits and arrangements and ordered the government to improve their support and allowances.In April 2006, Prof Chunda Bajracharya filed a petition at the Supreme Court against Maharjan’s petition, who had argued against the Kumari tradition. Bajracharya contended that the tradition should be preserved as heritage due to its over 100 years of history.“People who don’t understand the culture shouldn’t comment on it,” she stated. Bajracharya also criticised the human right activists who contended that Kumaris were only allowed to wear the colour red. “People who say Kumaris are forced to wear red clothing all the time, are the same people who send their kids to schools in uniform,” she said.“After the 2008 court verdict, there have been a lot of improvements. Now, a teacher visits the Kumari Ghar daily to tutor the Kumari, who is expected to complete school assignments and sit periodic exams. All the former Kumaris now get benefits like scholarships and special pensions,” she added.Bajracharya is currently a professor of literature at the Tribhuvan University in Kathmandu.“The only significant change that the court verdict brought to the tradition was in terms of her education,” said Gautam Prasad Shakya, the caretaker. “Kumaris were tutored long before the case, but the case helped formalise this arrangement. After the court verdict, the time between 12 pm and 4 pm was designated as the Kumari’s tuition time,” he added.After the verdict, there was a concerted effort to provide Kumaris with access to quality education, enabling them to develop the skills and knowledge needed to lead fulfilling lives beyond their divine roles. There was also a shift towards ensuring that the Kumari's living quarters are comfortable, safe, and conducive to her overall well-being.Moreover, the selection process for the Kumari underwent reforms in the aftermath of the Pun Devi Maharjan case. There was a push for greater transparency, accountability, and inclusivity in the selection of the Kumari, with an emphasis on ensuring that the process was fair, respectful, and free from undue influence.Efforts were made to support their transition into adulthood, including providing them with comprehensive resources for education, vocation, and social integration. This shift aimed to address the challenges faced by former Kumaris and empower them to lead independent and fulfilling lives after their divine service.“The Kumari tradition has evolved over time. During the tenure of my daughter, we saw a lot of improvements. Even after her time as Kumari, Matina continued to get a lot of government support,” said Shakya, former Kumari Matina’s father.“Some people argue that child rights are being violated, but all of her rights are being upheld inside the Kumari Ghar. This is a unique and respected aspect of Nepali culture, and I don’t believe it violates any of my child’s rights.”While the Kumari tradition continues, its practices have evolved. “She enjoys this normal life and it didn’t take her long to adjust as well,” says Matina’s father, on her transition from the revered Kumari to the ordinary Matina. \nWhat animals did Juddha Shumsher have in his zoo?“We only have records of animals from the mid-1960s,” says Ganesh Koirala, who has been employed at the Central Zoo for the past 36 years and currently serves as its information officer and programme officer. “That too I hand-copied from an old torn-down file that I came across.”Today, the Central Zoo, which sprawls across six hectares in Jawalakhel, Lalitpur, houses as many as 1,298 wild animals of different species of mammals, reptiles, fishes and birds from Nepal and around the world—from tiger, rhinoceros, hippopotamus and red panda to its recent attraction: a pair of chimpanzees.After enduring decades of neglect under various government bodies, with its animals and infrastructure scraping along in a deplorable state, the zoo received a new lease of life with improved infrastructure and animal care in 1995, when it came under the management of the King Mahendra Trust for Nature Conservation (KMTNC), now known as the National Trust for Nature Conservation, in 1995.Today, the Central Zoo is an entertainment venue, one of the most happening places in the Kathmandu valley. Flocked by thousands of daily visitors, the zoo now also hosts rescued animals and those in need of rehabilitation. It is also a site for conservation education.But when Juddha Shumsher Rana (prime minister from 1932–1945) built the Jawalakhel Zoological Garden on the premises of his Jawalakhel Durbar (where Nepal Administrative Staff College stands today) in 1932, he did so purely for private interests—as a space of entertainment and amusement for him and his family.Built in the semi-wilderness of Jawalakhel around a historical pond dating to the 17th century during the reign of King Siddhi Narsingh Malla, the zoo also became the space he could use to show his respect for two women he revered, his mother and sister-in-law, and indulge in one of his favourite pastimes—gambling.Today, the Central Zoo, nestled in the heart of Jawalakhel's sprawling crowd, does not go unnoticed, and its story is well told. But what passions drove Juddha to build the zoo? What was its original layout? What animals did it have in the beginning? And how did Juddha spend time there?“I remember once seeing a small board that read ‘Jawalakhel Zoological Garden’,” Koirala says. “I don’t know whether it was from Juddha’s time or was made in the later years. It must surely be that Juddha built the zoo out of influence from the British given how this term was used by them.”Koirala adds, “There is a former employee, now an elderly gentleman who worked in the zoo in the 1960s. He surely has some stories from Juddha’s time.”Birds, beasts and palacesTo trace the birth of Jawalakhel Zoological Garden, one has to look at the history of Nepal’s rulers owning birds and animals.Like rulers around the world, Nepal’s royalty kept wild and exotic birds and animals in captivity as a source of pleasure and mark of wealth and power. The book ‘Social History of Nepal’ by historians TR Vaidya, Tri Ratna Manandhar and Shankar Lal Joshi details how Mallas during the mediaeval Kathmandu Valley to Ranas and Shahs in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries owned rare, exotic creatures. In 1708, a rhinoceros in Kathmandu Valley broke the iron chain in which it was bound and killed its tamer. In 1714, Bhaktapur’s King Bhupatindra Malla gifted a camel and an elephant to Kantipur’s King Bhaskar Malla to build peace.Among Shahs, King Rana Bahadur Shah in particular was reputed for his collection of birds and animals. He also owned a zoo outside his palace in Basantapur Durbar Square, where the Nepal Bank Limited stands in New Road today. The zoo contained “tiger, bear, monkey, elephant, horse, deer… heron, peacock… pigeon, wild dogs, rabbits, rats, mongoose.”Jung Bahadur Rana’s zoo on the premises of his Thapathali Durbar hosted a variety of birds and animals collected during his hunting expeditions as well as those brought from abroad. Jung Bahadur himself used to “supervise and inspect it”. Juddha Shumsher likewise had his own collection of creatures which steadily expanded into a zoological garden. Seeking wilderness in his Jawalakhel DurbarJuddha’s biographer Ishwari Prasad writes in ‘The Life and Times of Maharaja Juddha Shumsher Jung Bahadur Rana’ that between 1933 and 1940, Juddha shot 433 tigers, 33 rhinoceros and 93 leopards. An insatiable big-game hunter, Juddha had a deep fondness for being in the wild and among wild animals, and from this came, according to oral history prevalent among members of Kathmandu’s Rana community including Juddha’s descendants, the desire to own a zoo.Built in 1752, Schönbrunn Zoo in Vienna, the world’s first modern zoo, was already over 100 years old when Juddha was born in 1875. London Zoo opened in 1828 and Alipore Zoological Garden (Kolkata Zoo) in 1875. Nawab Wajid Ali Shah Zoological Garden (Lucknow Zoo) was established in 1921. Juddha’s inspiration, his descendants say, was most likely reinforced by his tours to zoological gardens during his visits to England in 1908 and to different Indian cities.An article titled ‘Central zoo in state of neglect’ published in The Kathmandu Post in 1996 says that Juddha one day “received a pair of leopards as a gift”, cementing his desire to own a zoo. A report ‘Central Zoo Master Plan’ prepared by the KMTNC in 1996 says that Juddha decided to build a zoo in an epiphany when he saw that some animals “including deer, a few rhinos, and some tigers had been collected from the Tarai and kept in Kathmandu” could be put into one compound in the “lonely piece of land with a large 16th [sic] century Malla period Pokhari”.The pond lay still and serene surrounded by green wilderness ever since Patan’s King Siddhi Narsingh Malla built it in the 1600s. On the grounds surrounding this pond, the Newars from Na:Tole, Pulchowk and surroundings had their devisthans where, for centuries, they gathered to perform their religious ceremonies during Basanta Panchami and Bhoto Jatra even after this area fell within the Jawalakhel Durbar.For the palace, the ground served as its extended garden along with a horse and elephant stable. Subodh Rana, 69, grandson of Juddha Shumsher, recalled his father Kiran Shumsher telling him that Juddha and his family sometimes also used the scenic grounds for picnics. If there was any spot where Juddha wanted to build a menagerie, it would be around this Pokhari (pond). One day, he called his grandson General Maheshwar Shumsher Rana and deputed him to the task of doing just this.The zoo’s layout—except for the small plots of lands acquired later—that was in place when it came under KMTNC's management was, the present and retired zoo officials believe, mostly the same as it was built by Maheshwar and so offers a peek into how Juddha’s zoo must have been like. Pond in the middle of the ground surrounded by enclosures—the southern bank housing mainly larger animals, and cages for birds positioned on the northern banks.From pigeons to the king of the jungleWhat animals and birds did the enclosures at Juddha’s zoo house?“We cannot tell for sure,” Koirala says.Once it came under government ownership, the zoo was tossed from one institution to the other for lack of interest and knowledge on the right institution to manage it. Amid all this chaos, documents were possibly lost and the zoo has no concrete record about the animals that Juddha must have once taken amusement at, said Koirala.Mukti Narayan Shrestha, 82, a retired secretary of the Nepal government, joined the Central Zoo in 1970 as a veterinarian when many original structures of the zoo were still intact. Shrestha also worked with an elderly khardar who, he says, was employed in the zoo since the time of Juddha and was about to retire when he joined.“In those days where the purpose of menageries was exclusively for exhibition and pleasure with no regard for the welfare and recreation of animals and birds, the cages were tiny and iron-barred,” Shrestha says.Elephant, horses, deer, monkeys, tiger, rhinoceros, clouded leopard, red panda, bear, palm civet (nir biralo), four-horned antelope, Himalayan goral, pheasants, Himalayan monal—from the mythical and the majestic, the gentle and friendly to the fiery and ferocious, Juddha’s zoo boasted them all, Shrestha says.Shrestha’s account is not different from the anecdotes passed down to other retired and present zoo officials and the members of the Rana community, who also detail the rare and the exotic fauna, like the gharial crocodile and porcupine, even the jungle’s king—creatures, they say, that Juddha must have received from foreigners as gifts—appearing alongside domestic birds like pigeons.Tidbits of published information also confirm that the zoo had a good collection of exotic birds and animals from Nepal and abroad. One such suggestion comes from Kalyan Shumsher’s ‘Shree Teen Juddha Mahima’ published during Juddha’s reign in 1943.“One need not travel abroad to see the incredible birds and animals found in foreign countries,” he writes. “It will suffice to see [those creatures] right here in the zoo opened by His Holiness Shree 3 [Juddha] in Jawalakhel.”Among these incredible creatures, one reigned supreme—lion, the king of the jungle.For one, it would not have satiated Juddha to build a zoo and not have the jungle’s king exhibited in it. Juddha hence must have done everything possible to ensure one for the zoo. Infrastructure at the zoo suggests that the lion indeed lived at Juddha’s zoo or, in the least, during the Rana regime.“Where bear habitat lies today, there were two dome-shaped attached enclosures with a holding room, constructed in the classic architecture that many enclosures in the British zoos had in the past. They had brick walls and lime plaster,” Koirala says. “These were built to house a lion in one cage and a tiger in the other.”Near these enclosures stood another cage that remains intact today, with the head of a roaring lion carved out of the wall on the top of its iron bars. Zoo officials as well as members of the Rana community believe that Juddha had this exhibit built to specifically house a lion.Remarkably, these Juddha-era infrastructural spaces are corroborated by a rare piece of photographic evidence. A 1946 photo of the zoo shows a lion while a Kathmandu mother and her sons stand in front of its cage.Juddha’s place of piety and playThe zoo was not merely a space that Juddha sought out for amusement and retreat in the outpost of his palace; he also used this place to express his deepest affection.This affection spills right at the zoo’s entrance, in the form of the life-size statue of Karma Kumari Devi, wife of Juddha’s elder brother and Rana Prime Minister Dev Shumsher. Karma Kumari stands tall in her regal costume shaded by a wide canopy. Juddha revered Karma Kumari because it was she who raised him and looked after his mother Juhar Kumari Devi after the death of his father Dhir Shumsher. On another prominent part of the zoo on the south-east, Juhar Kumari’s enthroned statue overlooks the pond. Juddha had commissioned the London-based sculptor Domenico Antonio Tonelli to cast these statues.When Karma Kumari’s statue was unveiled is not clear, but Juhar Kumari’s statue was unveiled by Juddha amid a grand function in 1935 on Jawalakhel’s most auspicious day, Bhoto Jatra. It was attended by the British Resident Frederick Bailey.“On June 28, 1935, at Jawalakhel Durbar… the pond nearby looked very scenic,” says a Gorkhapatra news report titled ‘Statue installation’ dated July 5, 1935. “Because it was the day of Bhoto Jatra of Machhindranath… and moreover since an ideal woman’s statue was being unveiled, there was a crowd of lakhs of people.”Less than fifty metres from Karma Kumari’s statue stands a one-story building with a pagoda roof that today serves as the zoo’s meeting hall. Juddha, an avid gambler, found the scenic semi-wilderness covered in trees and filled with the sounds of wildlife to be a perfect place to relish the game. So he built a building with twelve doors on its four sides allowing him and his fellow gambling compatriots the freedom to enter through a particular door that they thought would bring luck. He called it his Juwa Ghar, the gambling house, and built it with the sole purpose of indulging in the game he loved. Roar of lion reverberates in KathmanduThe sounds of the animals and birds in the zoo rose up in the Jawalakhel sky. Every day, until much later in the 1970s, roar of the zoo’s lion (there were later other lions) diffused to far corners of the Valley, merging the zoo with the spirit of Kathmandu and informing the city folks of its presence.But was the zoo open to the public as well?“I think once it was built, the zoo was open for the public,” Subodh Rana said. “It is unlikely that Juddha Shumsher built such a large zoo and kept it only for his family.”For one, Kalyan Shumsher mentioning that one “need not travel abroad to see the incredible birds and animals found in foreign countries” suggests that the public had at least some access to the zoo. Of course, the Newar community from Na:Tole, Pulchowk and surrounding areas were permitted inside the zoo on the days of their guthi functions on Basanta Panchami and Bhoto Jatra.As the zoo was established at the back of the ground where Bhoto Jatra celebrations happen, it naturally filled with revellers on this day in addition to the guthi ritual observers as testified by the Gorkhapatra report. The photo of the mother and her sons also bear testimony that the zoo was not entirely closed to the public.What is widely believed, though, is that the zoo officially came under government ownership after Nepal became a democracy in 1951. And it would still be a few more years before it was open to the public in 1956.In 1945, Juddha gave up his power and eventually retired in Dehradun, India, where he died in 1952. With time, Jawalakhel Zoological Garden became the Central Zoo. It would take many avatars—a neglected site of crammed, unmaintained cages with sad eyes of emaciated creatures staring from behind the bars, a focal point of animal diplomacy, particularly during the period of monarchy, to, in its recent decades, a space of conservation and education.When all this was happening, the city sprawled around Jawalakhel, subduing the lion’s roar with its noise. More wildlife from around the country and the world came—creatures captured from the wild, those sold by circuses, those rescued from traffickers. Fate would bring these creatures to the care of generations of Kathmandu folks, intertwining each other’s joys and sorrows. After the tale of Juddha’s Jawalakhel Zoological Garden, there would be these stories to tell. Sitting around a table inside Juddha’s Juwa Ghar, Koirala and other zoo officials begin unfolding these stories before me. \nArtificial intelligence is the product of an unbounded craving for automation. Since the beginning of human civilisation, we have been inventing new machines and technologies to reduce our physical and mental efforts to accomplish tasks. The fascination with automatic intelligent thinking machines that can function as human brains have shaped the narratives of different eras of human history, coloured the imagination of scientists of different epochs and constructed the plots of science fiction. According to reports, those scientists and philosophers who described the process of human thinking as the mechanical manipulation of symbols were the first to plant the seeds of AI. The invention of programmable digital computers in the 1940s and the use of mathematical reasoning in their functioning made some scientists hopeful towards building electronic brains. For this purpose, AI research was founded at a workshop held at Dartmouth College in 1956, where John McCarthy, an American computer scientist and cognitive scientist, introduced the term “artificial intelligence”.After countless experiments and many failures, scientists have created several forms of AI for different objectives. However, the advancement of large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT in writing or composition has ignited widespread debate over their legitimacy, morality and suitability. Since its inception on November 30, 2022, ChatGPT’s use has drawn the attention of many theorists and scholars of writing pedagogy as it is now regarded as a thinking machine that can generate human-like texts. This intelligent machine can change traditional pedagogical practices by transforming the writing process, including students’ approach towards writing assignments. Some theorists think that these tools can negatively affect the writing process, while others believe that they can be used as reliable tools to move to different stages of the writing process. Positive uses of AI These days, student writers have access to various AI tools with diverse functions that help them go through different stages of the writing process. Grammarly is an editing tool that checks grammar, spelling, punctuation and style and gives required suggestions for further improvements. Quillbot can be used for paraphrasing; Snazzy AI for content creation; Sribbr Plagiarism Checker for detecting intellectual theft and ensuring originality. Among these tools, ChatGPT is regarded as the smartest and most powerful electronic thinking brain due to its ability to navigate corpus texts and produce human-like texts. Undoubtedly, AI’s prudent and creative application can assist student writers in the writing process, to which even pundits of composition pedagogy agree. For example, Generative AI manipulates the process of machine learning to generate results from the existing online corpus data by detecting recurring patterns. Gen AIs like ChatGPT can instantly work on user prompts and create desired texts. Even in academic settings, the likelihood of using diverse writing-related AI tools by students cannot be denied. This means that the future of writing or composition will be shaped by the invasion of AIs into these territories. So, we must use AIs creatively, honestly and wisely in education to maintain academic aura and integrity. This can bring opportunities for positive changes in education, particularly in teachers’ and students’ academic performance in writing and other activities. Negative impacts Despite the merits of AI in the writing process, they are not without flaws. The latest version of ChatGPT, which has become more powerful and creative in generating diverse texts, has made compositionists anxious about its consequences. They believe such tools may cause adverse effects on the overall writing process. They have detected serious flaws in AI-generated writing and are also concerned about the future of teaching writing and the possible misuse of AI by student writers. Opponents of AI have pointed out some drawbacks to the unrestricted and unchecked use of writing tools. First, AI tools lack the human creativity or cognition to differentiate bad content from good ones. There are also issues pertinent to the violation of copyright and plagiarism in writing. Moreover, large language models have been encoded in linguistic patterns of the so-called dominant language, English, which may give birth to a new form of colonialism and undermine the spirit of social justice for which minorities have been fighting for generations. The concept of linguistic inclusiveness in composition pedagogy and translanguaging (how bilinguals and multilinguals utilise their language skills to understand and engage with their environment) will likely be affected. Additionally, AI lacks humans’ crystallised intelligence/knowledge, contextual understanding and syntactical innovation and cannot be involved in meaning-making. Furthermore, AI cannot detect biases and discriminatory content found in their source data. AI-generated texts can cross all the boundaries of propriety, linguistic justice and social inclusiveness by creating unreadable and unacceptable texts. These contents are also just imitations, which can be repetitive and factually incorrect. In short, AI cannot work independently in expected ways. Human intervention and creativity are required to check them constantly. To bridge the divided perspectives and achieve a balance, student writers need to mitigate the negative aspects of AI-generated texts to save their composition, ingenuity and authenticity. They should use these tools as one relies on co-authors to assist with pre-and post-writing activities such as idea generation, editing and proofreading. Students should understand that depending entirely on AI will not be beneficial in the long run. After all, these tools aren’t independent thinkers and cannot replace our originality and empirical knowledge. \nAfter more than seven decades of independence, Indian politics finds itself at a crossroads, grappling with complex issues that challenge its foundational ideals. While it may be misleading to draw direct parallels with neighbouring Bangladesh, the invocation of Dr BR Ambedkar the iconic architect of the Indian Constitution into contemporary debates as recently happened in the Upper House of Parliament highlights a significant conundrum.This reference reflects not only our un-statesmanlike attitude but also our uncharitable attitude towards a stalwart who championed the rights of the underprivileged during an era when nationalist politics largely marginalised him. Even today, discussions surrounding the thinker qua activist Bhimrao Ramji Ambedkar evoke multiple discourses, positioning him in a metaphorical rehearsal room of history, awaiting an authentic assessment by future generations. His legacy serves as both a reminder and a challenge to current political narratives, urging us to confront the undue turns that politics takes for its own benefits. In reflecting on Professor Khilnani’s profound observation that Indian history is often portrayed as a “curiously unpeopled place”, we are morally bound to consider the essential contributions of its founding fathers.The question arises—can we envision India without acknowledging figures such as Kabir, Phule, Birsa Munda, Periyar, and Ambedkar? These individuals form the bedrock of the Indian Constitution and embody the multicultural essence of our society. Their legacies are steeped in a relentless struggle for justice and equality, which resonates through an immeasurable saga of sacrifice. Therefore, modern India cannot be understood solely through the glossy lenses of Yoga, discussions in well decorated seminar rooms on the ‘civilisation state’, or grand narratives of economic growth.Instead, it is crucial to recognise how the enduring thoughts and philosophies of these thinkers awakened the dormant masses from antiquity and shaped the identity of today’s Indian republic. Today, when we examine India, it is clear that its path to freedom was not a sudden midnight epiphany but rather a gradual evolution shaped by influential figures like Ambedkar. His contributions are inseparable from the annals of modern Indian history, as he dedicated his life to navigating the country towards radical experiments in social justice. Ambedkar’s polemics resonate with those of critical thinkers in that it boldly posed volleys of perturbing questions and thus challenged the entrenched system of caste/cultural hegemony, positioning himself against the mainstream currents of Indian nationalism.His efforts laid the groundwork for a more equitable society, highlighting the complexities and struggles inherent in India’s perennial quest for true freedom. The Indian state’s political actions, often driven by elite centralisation, clash with Ambedkar’s ideals, which diverge significantly from the narratives of major political entities like the Congress Party or current majoritarian frameworks. Ambedkar embodies a challenge to these dominant discourses, advocating for true democracy and genuine welfare for marginalised groups, including Adivasis. In contrast, the prevailing political logic tends to accommodate these communities not out of a benign commitment to democratic principles but rather as a means to construct a cohesive national entity capable of generating economic surplus. This approach prioritises the construction of political stability to strengthen the state over authentic democratic engagement and inclusivity in India’s diverse multicultural landscape. Even today, it appears that the elites are making concerted efforts to promote new discourses aimed at unifying India, particularly at a time when achieving a cohesive national identity seems increasingly challenging. The political landscape is heavily influenced by the narrative of “one nation, one election,” which seeks to streamline governance and enhance national unity. However, this push for a singular identity must be viewed through the lens of India’s multicultural society, which complicates the realisation of such a grand elitist vision.In this context, it is essential to critically examine and reflect on the cultural dimensions of our diverse populace. Many regions and sections experience psychological unease regarding the overarching project of transforming various social groups into a modern citizenry that would be loyal and acquiescent to the state. This necessitates a deeper understanding of how identity symbolism interacts with the lived realities of different communities across India. Thus, we understand that Ambedkar is no longer merely a protestant icon against the scourge of untouchability; today, his spirit gets amplified and becomes the pivotal embodiment as the key ideologue of social justice. His thought serves as a formidable barrier against the evolving challenges posed by the Indian state, particularly its attempts to undermine accountability amidst a crisis-ridden capitalism that threatens to stifle substantive democracy.This situation risks rendering the state increasingly authoritarian in a Hegelian sense. Consequently, any reference to Ambedkar must be approached with sensitivity, or else a murky climate of thought or similar veiled attempts might ultimately be self-defeating, if not condescending to India’s vast multitude of unequal citizens, hence undemocratic and unparliamentary.-The Statesman (India) / ANN \nOn December 19, 2024, the veteran communist leader and upper-house parliamentarian Bamdev Gautam caused quite a stir in the Dalit community by suggesting that the word ‘Dalit’ must be removed from official documents, including the constitution and the law. He made a fallacious argument that removing the word Dalit from all written documents would somehow emancipate that community and guarantee their rights.Speaking to the National Assembly’s Development, Economic Affairs and Good Governance, Gautam said, “Let’s remove the term Dalit from our dictionary… On the one hand, we decry discrimination against Dalits and the infringement of their rights; but on the other, our language, acts, constitution, law as well as document written by the scholars all refer to them as Dalits.” No doubt, Dalit has become a controversial term over the years, even within the Dalit community. Social media is full of comments from ordinary people, most of whom are upper castes, where the word is presented as a kind of license to dominate and discriminate against the “untouchables”. And, strangely, some Dalits themselves tend to agree! Especially the younger generation of Dalits, particularly those from the towns and with some opportunities and privileges, harbour a degree of disgust with the word. They think Dalit identity, Dalit quotas and Dalit literature have further exposed them to discrimination. There’s some truth in that, of course, but it’s a mistaken understanding.But this is the first time a senior communist politician—a former deputy prime minister and home minister—has expressed his anger at the Dalit word. How do we understand this attitude of a senior politician towards us? What does he want by attacking Dalit identity, one wonders: True liberation of Dalits or the end of their limited access to power and privilege?A nonsensical argumentGautam’s assertion on removing the word Dalit from legal and official documents and literature apparently for their own sake doesn’t make any sense. There’s no evidence to suggest that simply getting rid of a word automatically liberates the community from traditional oppression. There’s the glaring case of India. The Dalits of this country started using the term Dalit as their self-identification centuries ago. However, the Constitution of independent India, passed by the Constituent Assembly on November 29, 1949, doesn’t refer to any caste or community as a “Dalit”. The untouchables have been constitutionally and legally identified as the “scheduled caste” instead.A question to respected Gautam is: Has the avoidance of the term Dalit from the official lingo in India really contributed to the emancipation of Dalits? Has this policy really stopped the practice of untouchability in society? The answer is, squarely, no!In contrast, the usage of the term Dalit in Nepal is quite recent. The political movements of the “untouchables”, often supported by the Nepali Congress Party and the communist parties, borrowed it from India and started using it in their movements only seven decades ago. But we’ve been subjugated, exploited, separated and humiliated as “untouchables”, following Hindu laws, from centuries ago, well before the unification of Nepal by Prithvi Narayan Shah in the mid-18th century. It’s important to keep in mind, therefore, that the significant section of the Nepali population currently recognised as Dalits have been suppressed and tormented, including through state laws and policies (such as the Muluki Ain of 1854), since long before the use of the term came into use. Is it fair then to lay the entire blame of Dalit suffering on what I would consider an innocent word?Change culture, not literature Nobody would suggest that one word or one form of identity should be established forever. Healthy debates and discussions on any identification must be welcomed and encouraged. It’s a good idea to change communal identity befitting the changing times. But this should happen amongst the concerned groups themselves; upper-caste leaders like Gautam must not intervene.But many of us hold that this is not the time to argue against using the term Dalit. For one thing, unlike humiliating terms like untouchable and water-unusable and low caste and small caste, Dalit identity wasn’t forced upon us by the state or the religion. The state started using this term, instead of the other highly stigmatised terms mentioned above, according to our own needs and demands. Moreover, it’s crazy to think that simply removing the word would remove the stigma of caste and minimise caste hatred against us. It’s not that simple, is it? In this futile exercise, various Dalit groups have adopted new surnames including some resembling the prestigious upper-caste surnames. The Kami and Damai each has more than two hundred family names! A fake family name would provide a degree of cover against caste prejudice in unfamiliar social settings—but that doesn’t, and hasn’t, in any way, liberated anybody from the traditional forms of exclusion and humiliation. We recently met with former prime minister and Maoist chair Pushpa Kamal Dahal “Prachanda”, who agreed with our assertion that political changes alone haven’t changed the situation of Dalits on the ground. What is truly required is a separate “cultural revolution” against the caste system. I’ve heard some other senior politicians from across the party spectrum express a similar sentiment. Neither Dahal nor we meant here the cultural revolution conducted by Chairman Mao in China in 1967-76. I’ve long advocated the need for religious and cultural reforms to tackle the entrenched problem of caste discrimination in this country. The key to our success. People often frown at our assertion to conduct religious reform, maintaining that it’s impossible to amend Brahmanism. True, religious texts like Manusmriti can’t be reviewed as easily as a constitution or law. But that doesn’t mean religious traditions and beliefs can’t be corrected according to changing times. Our society has undergone many religious and cultural reforms in recent years. Upper castes no longer require ritual purification after returning from sea voyages. Intercaste marriage is quite common and acceptable, among non-Dalits in particular. Today’s Bahuns are free to drink alcohol, eat with other castes, play drums, run iron workshops and tailoring shops. Society has been far more rigid when it comes to reforming the religion and culture to guarantee the constitutional and legal rights of Dalits. That’s the last push we must all attempt. Despite the strong inertia, the state can reform religious and cultural beliefs and practices, with the aid of modern laws. Dalit freedom fighters must pressure the ruling class to work in that direction. We all want to break the chain of Dalitness. We have no pride in being born a Dalit. It’s an identity that should be dumped in the dustbin of history. But we will only become free from Dalit identity when the rituals and customs get rid of the practice of untouchability.  \nNepal is ahead of many countries in LGBTQIA+ rights and policies. The Constitution of Nepal recognises gender and sexual minorities, which even developed countries like the US don’t explicitly mention. Moreover, the judiciary’s support for the rights of the queer community has increased in recent years. While these achievements seem noteworthy at the outset, there is still a huge disparity between the laws and the reality queer people face every day. In Nepal, while much of the activism for the rights of the LGBTQIA+ community still focuses on something as basic as identity and legal recognition, issues like the sexual and reproductive health rights (SRHR) of these communities remain overlooked. Although the Constitution of Nepal ensures fundamental rights, such as reproductive rights under the Safe Motherhood and Reproductive Health Act (2018) for gender and sexual minorities, these provisions haven’t effectively catered to the sexual and reproductive health of these communities.The discrimination and stigma that gender and sexual minorities face daily manifests in their general inaccessibility of fundamental rights in Nepal. Programmes related to SRHR are usually associated with cisgender women and ignore LGBTQIA+ individuals. Queer folks are judged and ridiculed not just by their family members but also by the health staff at hospitals and health posts. This is problematic in a country where transgender people are forced to undergo surgery for medical verification to be legally recognised as “male” or “female”. Gender-affirming surgery requires medical professionals to follow certain clinical protocols; however, the existing law does not address gender reassignment. In August, the Supreme Court made landmark progress in recognising LGBTQIA+ rights by ruling that Rukshana Kapali, a transgender woman, must be legally recognised as a woman on all documents without requiring medical verification; however, the law for legal recognition remains the same for all. So, these individuals have no option but to travel to India for surgeries, which can be expensive and unsafe. Moreover, transgender men, lesbians and bisexual individuals often struggle to access basic menstrual hygiene products and healthcare facilities related to safe motherhood and abortion. The path to having and parenting children is fraught with difficulties for queer individuals, as IVF and adoption facilities aren’t accessible. While surrogacy is legal for infertile married Nepali couples, it is prohibited for singles, transgender couples and foreign nationals.Many people have the misconception that only cisgender women menstruate, but anyone with a uterus can experience it. These narratives arise through the limited awareness of our society and restrictive school curriculums. Such a perpetuation of false ideas further influences dominant ideas in popular platforms. Rarely do we see people from the LGBTQIA+ communities in the advertisements of sanitary pads or contraceptives. These communities often receive attention only during Pride Month (June), but progress in SRHR and other issues requires ongoing efforts, not just a month of focus.The legal recognition of same-sex marriage between Surendra Pandey and Maya Gurung in 2023 made many hopeful about the future of Nepal’s LGBTQIA+ individuals. Conversations about the potential of Nepal’s LGBTQIA+ tourism (rainbow tourism) have emerged since. To ensure its sustainability, we must prioritise fundamentals such as SRHR for the queer communities to create a safe space for them. For our economy to benefit from their participation, it must ensure that their primary needs are met with dignity.Our leaders cannot dismiss the issues of queer people by relying on the superficial claims of LGBTQIA+ policy advancements. Yes, there has been progress, but it is not enough. Lawmakers must understand that queer rights go beyond sexuality and identity and include all aspects of human rights, such as the right to sexual and reproductive health. Laws can only go so far if we do not change our deeply rooted beliefs and accept people for who they are while providing essential services. \nNepal’s dairy sector has for long been under financial strain. The cost of milk and milk products has spiked so much that many households have cut down on (or entirely stopped) their consumption. The price of processed milk, which was Rs76 a litre in January 2022, has climbed up to Rs120 a litre. Dairy products from Uttar Pradesh of India that are comparatively cheaper (INR62 or Rs100 a litre) are also smuggled into the country. As a result of reduced demand and steady imports of cheap products, the state-owned Dairy Development Corporation now has a stockpile of 600 tonnes of butter and 500 tonnes of powdered milk, and the farmers are yet to get Rs580 million the cash-strapped DDC owes them. Farmers, dismayed by the delays in payment, have often had to take to the streets.In an effort to settle the problem, the DDC has started exploring domestic private as well as international markets. To start with, it has agreed to supply 1,000 kg of raw cheese or whey (used to make chhurpi which is also called hard cheese) to a private company daily, starting December 30. The DDC will need 10,000 litres of milk a day to do so. The company, Himalayan Dog Chew, owned by the Manaram Group, exports chhurpi to the United States. Known as dog chew in the West, chhurpi is quite popular and in high demand among the owners of pooches in the US and Canada. But exporters in Nepal have struggled to meet the demand. So the deal between the private company and the DDC couldn’t have come at a better time. The dairy corporation has, for the first time, collaborated with the private sector to sell its products. But there’s still a lot of work to be done. As reported in Kantipur, the Post’s sister publication, eastern Nepal has a huge potential to export hard cheese, and some small dairy firms and farmers, with their own efforts, are selling these products in India without branding them. If Nepal could brand them and strike multiple such partnerships with more private companies in the countries in its immediate neighborhood, it could be to the benefit of both the DDC and the dairy farmers. Exporting milk products with the help of the private sector could bring relief to the farmers and the broader dairy industry. However, the success of this initiative is contingent on strong coordination between private companies and farmers. To facilitate this, the dairy corporation should establish a clear mechanism to get the milk from the farmers, who are at the start of the supply chain, to the exporters, who are at the end. There should also be a lot more coordination. For instance, while the demand for chhurpi is healthy, the butter that emerges during dog chew production doesn’t get the market. As the DDC is also planning to export butter to Tibet and to the larger Chinese markets, establishing a seamless channel of trade and communication between the farmers, the DDC and the private buyers would be vital. If China agrees to Nepal’s export proposal, experts say that the DDC’s products will not stockpile. With a little more thought put into the process, it could be a win-win prospect for all three sides.   \nThe Maoist party, which joined mainstream politics by signing the Comprehensive Peace Agreement in 2006, has always had a peculiar relation with semantics. In the insurgency days, the top Maoist leaders were not known by their real names but their noms de guerre. Partly, this was done to hide their identity, and partly, it was their way of overcoming individualism and pursuing a larger cause. Thus Pushpa Kamal Dahal became ‘Prachanda’, Baburam Bhattarai ‘Laldhoj’, Barsha Man Pun ‘Ananta’ and so on. The party has itself undergone various name changes to arrive at its current avatar of CPN (Maoist Centre). There are often rumours of the party leaders mulling removing the ‘Maoist’ tag. Despite this seeming flexibility, it must hurt all those involved in the decade-long war when the country’s top court repeatedly rejects their attempts to recognise the janayuddha (‘people’s war’). Most recently, the apex court ruled that it is unconstitutional to use the term in official documents. A year ago, it had rejected the-then Maoist-led government’s efforts to declare a public holiday on ‘People’s War Day’. With their strongest claim to political space—a self-sacrificing war waged for the benefit of the downtrodden and the marginalised communities—legally rejected, the use of violence that took nearly 17,000 lives, and left countless more disabled and ‘disappeared’, will be questioned even more in the days ahead. The Maoists and a section of the intelligentsia continue to talk up the war’s achievements: There would apparently have been no republican federal state without the war. Or a system of reservations for the marginalised communities. (Even this newspaper acknowledges the Maoist role in these developments.) Yet it is as important to factor in the party’s evolution in the post-war years. The causes that the party once held dear—particularly issues of the poorest and most marginalized sections of the society—have repeatedly been sacrificed at the altars of Dahal’s naked quest for power. These days, there is little to choose between the Maoist Centre and the old ‘bourgeois’ parties in the Nepali Congress and the CPN-UML that the former rebels once held responsible for all social ills. Times are also changing. Those born in the past three decades have little or no memory of the war. Instead, they have seen how its supposed achievements have been endlessly abused by leaders from across the political spectrum. For these younger folks, the idea of getting political legitimacy through a war waged in the name of Mao—a bloodthirsty dictator from another time and place—just does not sound right. Of late, the CPN (Maoist Centre) party has been making much of its ‘stellar’ showing in the recent bypolls. This, say party leaders, is an indication that their popularity is again on the up. That is unlikely. These small pockets of electoral success aside, indications are that people are highly dissatisfied by the functioning of the Maoist party as well as its chair Dahal. The loss in support among its once core constituencies is particularly alarming. Unless the Maoist leadership is ready to internalise and acknowledge how it has let these constituencies down and to commit to rectifying its mistakes, an electoral comeback looks tough. Unfortunately, for Dahal and his followers, there is no going back to the old-school janayuddha either.   \nThe CPN (Unified Socialist) was formed in August 2021 by a group of dissident CPN-UML leaders including two former party chiefs and ex-prime ministers—Madhav Kumar Nepal and Jhala Nath Khanal. The party, which has 10 seats in the federal lower house is struggling with organisation building, re-elected Nepal as party chief in July. The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal sat down with Chairman Nepal to hear his assessment of the new party’s three years and his future plans for it.How do you review the first three years of your party?First, we have to start with the question of if the formation of this party was necessary. We made the absolutely right move by revolting [against the CPN-UML leadership’s actions]. We foiled the attempts to trample on the constitution and stopped the autocratic, regressive, rightist and individualistic tendencies from prevailing in Nepali politics. Our moves have been politically, legally as well as constitutionally justified, with even the Supreme Court validating them. After that, we displaced the then [KP Sharma Oli-led] government, and brought national politics on the right track. We then formed this party. Politics doesn’t always go in a straight line. In politics, you face ups and downs, twists and turns and sometimes turbulence. Those who are powerful today could become weak and may disappear over time. Weaker forces may get stronger. Some of our friends say, “Our revolt was right but joining the coalition was wrong”. But it was the need of the time. It is true that we committed some mistakes and couldn’t get enough proportional representation (PR) votes in federal and provincial polls in 2022. We were unnecessarily flexible while making seat allocations with other coalition partners in a number of constituencies. We also strongly opposed the proposals of coalition partners in certain constituencies and fought on our own strength and won seats. For instance, the CPN (Maoist Centre) didn’t cooperate with us in my own constituency in Rautahat. They didn’t vote for us. But I still won. We fought elections in some palikas [local units] on our own and won majority seats there. But in certain areas our local leaders couldn’t properly negotiate with other partners. Now we should neither be over-reliant on the election coalitions nor do we need to criticise it. Others will recognise us only if we increase our strength. We have had mixed experiences in the past three years. We should be encouraged and optimistic about the future.But our observation from outside is that your party failed in the elections. It couldn’t even secure national party status and you have done poorly on the organisation front as well. The situation would be drastically different had all the friends who were initially with us remained active with firm commitment. Some friends lost confidence. Therefore, we couldn’t perform as per the expectations. But our party has produced exemplary results in Madhes Province. We were doing well in Rautahat district even until the latest by-polls. My activeness has never diminished and I have left no stone unturned in terms of inspiring other leaders. But everyone should actively work to build a party. Some people talk big but don’t take responsibility.You touched on what went wrong in terms of securing PR votes. Could you elaborate?Our situation would be much better had we fielded more candidates, at least in provincial seats. Our party chapters and members would have been more active in the constituencies if our candidates were in the field. The Janata Samajbadi Party Nepal made a smart move in this connection. The JSP fielded more candidates for provincial seats. From the start, JSP leaders used to wonder in coalition meetings about how they would get PR votes if their candidates aren’t in the constituencies. As our party members joined the campaigns for common candidates of the coalition, they couldn’t ask for votes in our party’s election symbol ‘pen’ in the PR category. Had we mobilised separate teams to campaign for the PR votes, we could have easily crossed the threshold for PR seats in the House of Representatives. Don’t you think the party is top-heavy with senior leaders while failing to attract new faces?We have no dearth of leaders or cadres. But we have a problem in mobilising them. In our party, the monitoring and evaluation system is weak. You can’t make one answerable unless you have an evaluation system in writing. Therefore, this time we have assigned responsibilities for just a year. Now they have to submit periodic reports of activities in their respective committees. We became too lenient and didn’t punish those who didn’t work. You led a huge organisation in the UML for one-and-half decades. But you appear to be struggling to fix issues in this relatively small organisation.See, people are becoming more selfish, self-centered and lazy. So, we have to make our evaluation system strong. As we have a strong organisation and the right ideology and values, we should now launch pro-people movements and connect with the public.Do you think the party failed to attract and mobilise people due to its continuous engagement in the government since formation and lack of attractive agenda?We don’t lack agendas. We have identified and enlisted many issues directly linked to the people’s livelihood in our political paper. We failed to reach the doorsteps of the people. For instance, if there is violence against a woman, our women chapter should immediately reach there. Likewise, the student wing should actively work for the rights of students. Some of our friends say we shouldn’t have stood in favour of endorsement of the MCC [Millennium Challenge Corporation’s compact]. They argued it was being implemented to encircle our neighbour China and establish a military base in our country. We suspected the same. But our country had already signed on to that. Different interpretations of the concept related to the project emerged. Some described it as a part of the Indo-Pacific Strategy. When we studied the matter, we found CPN-UML chair KP Oli was all set to endorse the compact without any changes in the text, bypassing us. Oli put forward five conditions for that before then prime minister Sher Bahadur Deuba. The conditions included impeaching Speaker Agni Sapkota for not taking action against us [UML had demanded that the Speaker strip 14 lawmakers who quit UML to form the new party of their positions], scrapping our party’s registration in the Election Commission and removing us from the coalition. But Deuba ji stood against that. Then, we found a middle way, which was to endorse the compact with a 12-point explanatory note. So that was the right decision. The government earlier this month signed the framework for the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) cooperation agreement with China. What is your view on this?It is natural to take it [BRI] forward as we have implemented the MCC of the US and have joined hands with other countries and multilateral agencies to carry out our development activities. The projects to be built under the BRI have no strategic or military connections and are based on mutual benefit. So there is no need to be suspicious and we have to focus on how to take maximum benefits from projects under the BRI.Just a few days ago, you met and talked to Bamdev Gautam, who appears ready to join your party. What is the progress on this?He has said he is ready to join and accept our party’s decisions. We are discussing this. He has played an important role in critical political junctures. He strongly supported me during the second People’s Movement in 2006. A political party needs such leaders. We are thinking of concluding this process [of welcoming him] soon.What about Bhim Rawal joining the party?Unhappy with the party leadership, he has been inactive in the UML but he has not made up his mind to join our party.Is finalising Gautam’s hierarchy and role in the party taking time?There won’t be an issue in the case of Bamdev ji. But overall, the number of leaders in our party is big. In the Chinese Communist Party, there are only seven members in the Politburo Standing Committee and 17 members in Other Politburo Members. But there are 24 members in our party’s central secretariat, 41 in the standing committee and 108 members in the politburo. Those who get a candidacy in the election celebrate but those who don’t get a ticket become inactive. Some others fight for ministerial posts. Yet others complain about not getting a ‘lucrative’ ministry. We have to manage them all.What about reunifying the party with the UML or the Maoist Centre? Many say leaders are more comfortable with the Maoist Centre but party cadres are for rejoining the UML.Most of our cadres are from the UML background. That might have played a role. But at present there is no possibility of our reunification with the UML. Also, the situation isn’t right to forge unity with the Maoist Centre.It is said that there is pressure from party members for reunification with the UML?That’s not true. There is a negative view about us in the UML and therefore our party rank and file wouldn’t be ready to surrender. Some might be lobbying for entry into the UML for personal benefits. Even if some join the UML, it won’t be easy for them there.But some noted leaders such as Ram Kumari Jhakri who had strongly supported you in the course of building this party have said that the Unified Socialist can’t run like this and that it is better to merge with the UML?I also enquired about her remarks but she said her intent had been misunderstood. But I repeat that there is no possibility of unity with the UML. We studied the possibility of unity with the Maoist Centre but concluded that we can’t accept Maoism and we also found their election symbol inappropriate. So the process has stopped. For now, we will concentrate on strengthening our own party.How is the Unified Socialist different from the UML?Our’s is a policy-driven party and not leader-centric. Committee system prevails in our organisation, not the leader’s orders. We discard rightist approaches and follow revolutionary ideas. We don’t see these qualities in the UML. Only our party has a policy of ‘Socialism with Nepali Characteristics’. We prioritise our agenda based on justice, fair distribution, production and good governance. There was a period when socialism stressed only on equality and therefore some termed it a distribution of poverty but we believe socialism as a principle of prosperity. Capitalism focuses only on profits even at the cost of people’s lives and wars but socialism values people’s lives and livelihoods. So, we are clearly against capitalism and in favour of socialism. But there are different forms of capitalism. We are for promoting national capitalism and eliminating comprador capitalists. We need to invite and welcome foreign investment to increase production in the country.Your party held its general convention in July first week and it took months to elect other office bearers and assign roles and responsibilities. Why?It shouldn’t have happened. Some wrong elements entered our party. Some showed immaturity by raising the issue of ‘new generation’. That spoiled the situation. Building a party is not easy. It calls for many things including ideological clarity, capacity to lead the organisation efficiently and an accepted personality. We have to learn from this episode and remove the mistrust that cropped up in this course. \nIt has been five months since the Nepali Congress and the CPN-UML formed a coalition government on July 15 by stepping on the seven-point deal inked on July 1. How is the coalition of the two biggest political parties faring? The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal sat down with Krishna Khanal, a professor of political science, for his insights.How do you evaluate the performance of the Congress-UML government based on the pledges they made at the time of coalition formation?Two biggest parties getting together to form a government is a bit unusual in the system we have adopted. The strength of the system is that the government can be made accountable by a strong opposition. But when the two biggest parties join hands to run the government, the opposition in the House becomes weak. This is a concern. The Congress and the UML have had joint governments in critical junctures in the past. Now, there is no extraordinary situation requiring them to forge a coalition but they justified it saying it would end political instability. Their argument was that unreasonable bargaining of smaller parties made the prime ministers weak. That’s partially true. However, the crux of the matter is that they wanted to enjoy consolidated power. KP Oli wanted to be prime minister and the Congress leaders who were out of power wanted to return to Singha Durbar. So they signed the seven-point deal with the pledge of amending the constitution.Has this coalition been a success? What are the initial indications?There are certain curious things. The seven-point agreement doesn’t say the UML will hand over government leadership to the Congress in the second phase of their partnership. It says, after two years, UML chair Oli will hand it over to Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba. It shows how our parties have become leader-centric instead of institution-centric. After all, Oli and Deuba are the chiefs and parliamentary leaders of their respective parties and they are the ones who will lead the government. Still they wished to specifically mention their names, which indicates they still feel insecure. Likewise, Prime Minister Oli says that he is handing over power to Deuba in July 2026. Recently he said he is handing it over after 18 months. Despite there being a written agreement, he keeps repeating the timeline. This suggests mutual mistrust due to past records of betrayal. It is true that the Congress and the UML together have a strong majority in the House and, with the backing of a few other smaller forces, they can manage two-thirds majority needed to amend the constitution. But when it comes to political issues, even the small parties in the coalition are hardly on the same page. So numerical strength alone won’t work. Hence there has been no progress on constitution amendment in the past five months. These pledges were made just to create a pretext to get to power.Is the present government any different to the erstwhile Dahal-led coalition, particularly on delivery?No. In the seven-point agreement, they pledged to improve the ailing economy. We don’t find any reform and the economy is still stagnant. I can’t recall a single thing this government has done that is worth appreciating. The only thing this coalition has achieved is ending unusual power manoeuverings by Prachanda [Maoist Centre chair Pushpa Kamal Dahal]. The way Dahal was switching alliance partners between the Congress and the UML was unnatural. The present coalition ended the trend, at least for now. Also, some unhealthy activities taking place in provinces have been stopped. But the government has utterly failed to provide any relief to the people. What about the process of amending the constitution?The Congress and the UML leaders have often blamed the proportional representation (PR) electoral system for the country’s political instability. The UML proposed to limit the scope of the PR system to the National Assembly and some Congress leaders have also floated this idea. After the formation of this government, many people assumed that this coalition may take some action to implement those propositions. But doing so is not easy. Despite a strong majority in the House, the Congress and the UML alone can’t amend the constitution. Other small parties won’t support them to water down the PR system. The top leaders are conspicuously silent as they know diverse issues are going to open up once they start the process. For instance, the Rastriya Prajatantra Party wants to revive Hindu monarchy and the Madhes-based parties have their own grievances. Moreover, if you analyse the election results since 2008, it’s not difficult to infer that not only small parties but even the major forces will think twice before making any changes to the PR system. Be it big or small, old or new parties, all have gotten a significant number of seats under the PR category. In the first Constituent Assembly election in 2008, the Congress and the UML were in crisis. It was the PR system that saved them from being pushed into an existential crisis. Besides that, there is one big political reason behind the adoption of this electoral system and that is to ensure representation of various underprivileged communities in state organs. We can’t forget that context. Hence the Congress and UML leaders have been silent on the constitution amendment in the past couple of months.Is there any need to review or amend the constitution?There is a need to seriously review and analyse the problems faced in the course of implementing the constitution in the past nine years. For instance, the vice-president has no role. He can be made ex-officio chair of the National Assembly, as in India. Then, the state doesn’t need to elect the upper house chair. This option was discussed during constitution writing as well. Recently, we conducted by-polls to fill the vacant positions of chiefs of local units. These polls were unnecessary as there can be a provision to entrust the deputy chiefs with the responsibility of carrying out the chief’s duties when the position goes vacant. There is a need for a comprehensive review and changes in some provisions based on the practical experience of statute implementation. But there are different parties and groups that want to raise different political agendas. For instance, some want a more powerful federal system while others want to scrap the system and revive Hindu monarchy. How should we review the national charter and what kind of mechanism will be right for that?The best way is through a review commission composed of politicians and subject experts. But leaders don’t trust independent experts who don’t follow their instructions. Forming a body of experts loyal to the leaders is meaningless. Therefore, a special parliamentary committee can be entrusted with this task. The panel will be composed of members from political parties based on their strength in the House. The parties and other stakeholders can submit their formal proposals to the committee and the experts can give their inputs to the same panel. The body can help give shape to the ongoing debates and discussions will take place in a more organised and formal way. It can conduct a thorough study of the complications seen in the course of constitution implementation. My emphasis is not on amending the constitution on political grounds but from the perspectives of removing difficulties experienced in the course of implementation. For instance, provinces have failed to prove their relevance. Now, we need to study where the problems are. But I don’t think the political parties are going to work on this issue with the seriousness it deserves. Leaders, of late, have proposed to increase the threshold to secure seats under the PR category, which can be done by amending election laws. They have floated the idea of increasing the PR threshold to five percent. [At present, it is three percent at the federal and 1.5 percent at the provincial level]. If it is increased to five percent, hardly four or five political parties may qualify for the PR seats. So this is not an appropriate proposal. To ensure political stability, we have to instead develop a system supportive of a coalition culture. The problem lies in our leaders and not in the constitution. For instance, why did Prachanda switch alliances multiple times after the last election? There is no point in blaming the system for instability. To discuss and debate all these issues, we need a review body.What is your analysis of the recent local by-polls results?The voting pattern shows that the big parties couldn’t increase their vote shares and failed to attract voters. The Congress lost more seats in comparison to the last by-polls. The UML had mixed results while the Maoist Centre made some gains. As it fought single-handedly this time, the Congress lost some seats that it had won with the support of alliance partners last time. This is natural. The Maoist Centre appears to have benefitted by being in the opposition and as it concentrated its strengths in select areas for the past few months. Party chief Dahal himself visited some remote local units. The Congress doesn’t appear serious about reviewing its poor performance while the UML has decided to study the matter and find what went wrong. The Maoist leaders look excited but the party has not made much progress in popular votes. There are assumptions of some informal collaborations between the Maoist Centre and the Rastriya Swatantra Party. The way Dahal has defended Rabi Lamichhane in recent days backs the assumption.Why do you think the performance of new forces including the RSP and Janamat were poor in the by-polls?My assumption is that voters rethought the need to change the party of their choice if the main objective of the leaders from new parties is to be ministers. RSP chief Rabi Lamichhane insisted on becoming home minister. In the meantime, recent investigations have shown his linkages to cooperative scams. People might have thought that he is not a clean person. These factors might have played a role. Last time, people supported new forces not to make their leaders ministers but for political reforms. The chief minister from Janamat Party who is leading the provincial government in Madhesh formed a 20-member Cabinet, which is the biggest ever there. He downsized it only after severe criticism. Such developments certainly play a role in elections. These are just assumptions. We can’t jump to conclusions but it is safe to say that Nepali voters are consistently trying to find better alternatives.While there were reports of former President Bidya Devi Bhandari rejoining the UML to return to active politics, former Vice-President Nanda Bahadur Pun is most likely to join the Maoist Centre. What kind of precedent will this set?I don’t see serious problems in former vice-presidents rejoining active politics as they don’t play any vital role as vice-presidents. But the issue of former Presidents returning to active politics is serious as such a precedent will invite serious anomalies. Though the constitution and laws don't bar former presidents from making such a comeback, politics should be guided by certain values, principles and convictions. Bhandari’s return to active politics will be unfortunate. It should be stopped. \nPrime Minister KP Sharma Oli returned home on December 5 after a four-day official visit to China. During the visit, the two countries signed the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) Framework Cooperation agreement. The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal sat down with Bishnu Rimal, chief advisor to the prime minister, who was one of the key interlocutors during the framework agreement negotiations, for insights on how the deals were finalised between the two countries.There are many queries about the details of the agreements signed between Nepal and China last week. Please tell us about the key points.Nepal and China had been exchanging documents related to the Belt and Road Initiative of China since 2020, under the BRI implementation plan. While signing any agreement, the two countries engage in rigorous negotiations and at times it takes a long time even to finalise a word. This time, we signed a framework agreement, which is like a basket, where we have put many things. It’s different from a memorandum of understanding (MoU). In the agreement, we have described its background, principles, objectives, the modality of mobilising financial resources and implementing mechanisms. Even the previous government led by Pushpa Kamal Dahal had planned to finalise it but it didn’t in the end. Now we have taken it ahead. The new agreement should be understood in a context. In 2016, we were in government [during Oli’s first tenure] and we visited Beijing. At the time, China was supporting Nepal through the Trans-Himalayan Multi-Dimensional Connectivity Network (THMDCN) package. Later, the support was provided through the BRI and the THMDCN became a part of it. Nepal reached an MoU to this effect in 2017. After that, an implementation plan needed to be signed. Following the formation of the present government, we held discussions on this. The two major coalition partners—the Nepali Congress and the CPN-UML—formed a four-member team for this specific purpose. Party general secretary Gagan Thapa and lawyer Semanta Dahal from the Nepali Congress and Yubaraj Khatiwada ji and myself from the UML were in the team. In the past, we have reached several agreements with China, India, the United States, Japan and various other countries and sought support from them. But we haven’t been able to properly utilise the support. Our [taskforce’s] focus was to ensure best use of the pledged amount and implement the agreements. At first, we studied the documents exchanged after 2020. At the beginning we forged consensus between the UML and the Congress and then shared the document with the Chinese side because it can only be implemented after it is acceptable for both sides. This time, we wanted to take the implementation process ahead because Nepal joined the BRI process years ago. Nepal has already joined China’s Global Development Initiative, which is an international development concept. But there were some confusions about our participation in development projects under the BRI. There needed to be more clarity on our side. At times, it has been dragged into controversy. We wanted to dispel rumours and confusions.First of all we all should know that the BRI is a framework and the agreement we signed is a basket deal. Later, we will select specific projects and negotiate on particular details and conditions. In fact, the debate ahead of the prime minister’s visit was driven by whether to take loans or grants from China. That was wrong. It is rather a project-based approach. On certain projects, we need all grants while on certain others, we may jointly develop them. Still in other projects, we have to seek concessional loans. All these things depend on what project we are talking about. If a project can pay back the loan, that could be dealt accordingly. But our discussions were driven by the concept of loan versus grant. Even top leaders got swayed by such narratives and reacted accordingly. China has declared huge grants to Nepal multiple times since 2016. But we haven’t been able to use them as we have to earmark the amounts and seek them. First, we have to say that we are going to use this money in these projects. We at the task force concluded that the amount of the grants pledged by China is enough for us for now. There is no need to take out a loan now. Our priority is to get the grants that have been stuck for years. Do we need to select certain projects for that?Yes, we have to first finalise the projects and prepare business plans. We can explore other options only if the grant money is insufficient for a particular project. For instance, if we start working on a cross-border railway, we would discuss whether the grant money is sufficient and whether to seek more grants or go for loans. We aren’t in that stage now. We are yet to receive the grant announced during the visit of Chinese President Xi Jinping in 2019. Similarly, grants were announced during the China visits of then President Bidya Devi Bhandari, first President Rambaran Yadav and our prime minister KP Sharma Oli. Also, this time, the Chinese President has announced 500 million RMB in assistance. So, again, first we have to work to receive and use the grant money. For instance, recently, the Chinese side announced to provide electric vehicles worth US$10 million as support through the Chinese embassy. The EVs include public buses, ambulances and school vans but they release them only after we provide the specifications of the vehicles that we need. The amount we sign as a budgetary support can be used wherever we want but other sums are released only after we earmark them for certain projects. After a long negotiation, Nepal and China have agreed on the term ‘aid assistance financing’. What does that mean?During the negotiation, we had used the term ‘grant and different financing modalities’. Later, we agreed to replace the word ‘grant’ with ‘aid’. We did so as we wanted to keep the door open in terms of seeking support from a country. If we say that we won’t receive any support except grants, it creates complications in the overall investment scenario. The Chinese government may provide a certain amount of grant to the government of Nepal but it doesn’t give it to the private sector.If Nepal’s private sector plans to attract investment from China, the World Bank, the ADB or any other agencies, for example for a mega hydro project, they may not get it as the Chinese side knows that Nepal accepts only grants and no other form of investment. Such a condition creates complications as this agreement is applicable even for the private sector. Therefore, we didn’t want to close the door. We can’t say we accept loans from this country but not from the other. We accept assistance that serves our national interest.Will the negotiations now onward be project-specific then?Yes. It will be project and proposal specific. Such issues will be negotiated only when we discuss a certain project. Therefore, the ongoing debate over grants versus loan is pointless. For instance, we didn’t receive certain portions of the assistance announced by India immediately after the 2015 earthquakes. Such is also the case with China and with other countries on occasions as the conditions attached to them weren’t acceptable to us.After the failure in operating Pokhara Regional International Airport due to lack of business plans, people are now suspicious about the utilisation of any assistance fruitfully.How can you say the Pokhara airport project is a failure? First, one should study the airport’s capacity and check how many passengers are flying to Pokhara now. A good number of people are flying there. I think the interest rate on the loan we took from China to build the airport is no different to the rate we receive from the World Bank, the IMF and other multilateral agencies. We can debate whether we have been able to operate the airport in its full capacity. But there is no need to scandalise it unnecessarily.Ahead of the prime minister’s visit, there were voices that Nepal should seek a waiver of Pokhara airport loan from China. What happened?Let me ask you a question. Imagine, you took a loan from Rastriya Banijya Bank to meet your needs. Say, there is a government led by a leader who favours you. Can the prime minister waive off your bank loan? No. You have to follow the system. So your question is wrong. The Pokhara airport deal is not a grant. It’s a commercial deal. Those who run the government can’t use the language of Durga Prasai, who threatens not to pay back bank loans. What are the agreements on road connectivity and cross-border railway projects?We have included five points under the infrastructure-urban development project. These are Tokha-Chhahare Tunnel, Hilsa Simkot Road Project, Kathmandu-Khandbari Road, Kimathanka Bridge, the cross-border railway project from Rasuwagadhi to Kathmandu and the Amargadhi City Hall. Likewise, we have included a cross-border transmission line to start energy trade with China. Under education and health, we agreed to establish universities and colleges. The Chinese side is carrying out a feasibility study of the railway project with a plan to complete it by 2026. Once the study is complete, we will discuss the funding modalities and business plans.What is the status of the Tokha-Chhahare tunnel project?The China side is in a position to complete its feasibility study. After that, construction work will start.Nepal has signed so many agreements with China. While we have progressed a lot on paper, there is little progress on the ground. Will the present agreement make any substantive change in this connection?Nepal is behind on monitoring and follow up. We should have formed bilateral mechanisms and monitored work progress. Now, there is a sense of urgency in the government to expedite development works. An inter-agency mechanism will be formed within our government. It will monitor and facilitate the work and the line ministries will execute the plans.Why are the agreements signed with China not made public, unlike the deals inked with other countries?There is no problem in making them public because there is nothing to hide. But all agreements aren’t made public. The MCC Compact had to be taken to the parliament as people were divided over it. Then, it was publicly debated. Likewise, people are now expressing their curiosity towards the BRI documents. But there are many projects people don’t care about. When needed, the documents can be made public as nothing can be hidden these days. And there is nothing wrong in making them public.UMl’s coalition partner Congress was reportedly reluctant to sign the framework agreement. What was its concern?That is a wrong narrative. Both the UML and the Congress were on the same page. It was possible to conclude the agreements because we had consensus.But the Congress leaders expressed their concerns in public ahead of the visit and even after the signing of the deals.We have to follow the party’s official decisions, not the statements of individual leaders. How would it have been possible to reach agreements if there were differences in the two-party taskforce, in the leadership and the party’s official positions? It’s a Nepal-China agreement jointly done by the UML and the Congress, and backed by all other parties. The prime minister convened a meeting of former prime ministers and foreign ministers ahead of his visit. All of them advised the prime minister to sign the agreement with China. Why was the signing of the agreement delayed?While signing a bilateral agreement, we can’t think only from our perspective. Negotiation always takes long. The joint statement has stated that the two sides are ready to sign the BRI framework as soon as possible. It took time for us to share the documents with the Chinese side after we reached Beijing. It’s not like two leaders just sit, discuss and sign on that. They have to consult concerned ministries, departments and officials. The Chinese worked overnight after we submitted the documents. My impression is that the Chinese side showed magnanimity and adopted a short-cut approach and signed on the deals. They were ready to sign the agreements on our conditions. That was a wonderful gesture.What were the specific points of contention and how were they resolved?We substantially edited the documents that were exchanged in the past, making them more specific and converting them into a framework of cooperation. Therefore, the Chinese side needed at least a day to study them. They argued that it would work even without mentioning the word ‘grant’. In view of the narratives in Nepal, we proposed to use ‘grant’ or a word with similar meaning. Then, we proposed ‘aid assistance financing’, and they accepted the term.How will the new deal be implemented?There used to be confusion about whether a certain project is under the BRI. China said even the Pokhara airport project is under the BRI while we said it was initiated before that. Now onward, all projects with China will be under the BRI cooperation. All the financing and investments from China will enter Nepal through the BRI window. We will prioritise the projects already proposed and under study such as the railway project, Tokha-Chhahare tunnel, and Madan Bhandari University. We have agreed to strengthen connectivity on border points and work will be expedited there. That will help transform Nepal from a land-locked into a land-linked country.Why are the projects being developed with Chinese involvement so slow?These days the Chinese side tells us to give projects only after clearing the sites. For instance, the 17-km Syafrubeshi-Rasuwagadhi road is to be built by Chinese grants. There is one transmission pole standing in the way. We are yet to remove it from the construction site. They haven’t started the work citing the same reason. Creating an environment to work on the field is our responsibility. It’s not that only China-built projects are slow. Such is also the story with our projects with other countries and agencies. Even in the case of the MCC projects, it took a long time to finalise many issues. We are too slow in implementing agreements and executing projects. First, we have to do some retrospection and improve our efficiency.  \nWang Peng, a research fellow from the Institute of State Governance at Huazhong University, Wuhan, was previously Deputy Secretary-General of the National Academy of Belt and Road Green Development (NABRGD) Beijing. Peng, a keen observer of South Asian geopolitics, was recently in Kathmandu to participate in ‘Kantipur Conclave-2024’. He sat down with the Post’s Purushottam Poudel and Kantipur’s Jagdishor Panday to discuss a host of issues. Excerpt:How have Nepal-China relations evolved in recent times? Generally, bilateral ties between Nepal and China have been stable. Politically, China’s Nepal policy has been stable too. Even though the administration in Nepal has changed, Kathmandu still has a stable and friendly policy towards China. Relations are progressing steadily. But we still have room for progress. Nepal’s Prime Minister is visiting China in the first week of December. This is a perfect opportunity for the Nepali and Chinese governments to enhance mutual understanding and political trust. Face-to-face meetings between the leaders of two countries are crucial. Due to the Himalayas, many Chinese people, including me, consider Nepal a country far away. But actually, we are alongside each other, not far. Nepal is an hour’s distance from Lasha and a few hours from Chengdu, which is very close. Despite being a close neighbour, China is often accused of not investing enough in Nepal, at least as compared to its other neighbours. Why is this so? There is no need to compare countries as every country has its own conditions. China’s investment in Nepal is significant, especially considering Nepal’s current economic size, population, and capability to use foreign capital effectively. We may talk about the cooperation between China and Pakistan, with the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) as a flagship BRI program. China indeed has a massive investment in Pakistan. China has good relations with Pakistan for many reasons, one of them being that Pakistani politicians usually do not play the so-called “China card”. Despite political changes in Pakistan, relations between Beijing and Islamabad are seldom harmed. China is equal to every partner within the BRI framework, so the key variable essentially is the local leaders’ political choices and their ability to build consensus in domestic politics.What are you trying to suggest when you say Pakistan does not play China card? Many Chinese International Relations scholars, including me, appreciate Pakistan. What we appreciate about Pakistan is that despite their internal political differences, there is a bottom line that none of them uses China as a card. Because of this, Chinese companies dare to invest in Pakistan. This is good—good for these companies and good for the local guys—and this has created more than 10,000 jobs for the local guys over the past few years. In this way, China and Pakistan have accumulated a high level of strategic trust. Non-intervention has been the fundamental principle of Chinese foreign policy. In most developing countries, the government often changes. The country’s people can change the government if they think it has done no good to the citizens. We only hope that politicians do not use China as weapons when fighting for power. So the goal should be to devise a win-win plan to benefit both sides. You mentioned China’s investment preferences abroad. But don’t you think that the investment decisions of a democratic government and an undemocratic one like China will be different? China is a democratic country. People say that China is not a democratic country since it does not have an election. But the Chinese leaders are under intense pressure to think about history. The Chinese government and the leaders should work for the benefit of all the citizens of the country, not just for their supporters. For example, Donald Trump doesn’t need to serve all American people. Even if he supports the people who supported him during the election, his work is done. However, in China, this is not the case. The Chinese government should reconcile different peoples and encourage joint development of the country. A country like China, which is big both in terms of people and land mass, will split if the government does not tread cautiously. That’s China’s nightmare. We have suffered many tragedies in history, so we don’t want this kind of thing to happen again. The Chinese Communist Party, government and high-ranking leaders believe in history. That is why they try to create or design five-year institutions, projects, and reform plans.For example, the Chinese still celebrate Deng Xiaoping’s legacy. Despite being the leader who was not elected, did Deng use power arbitrarily? No. He prudently used his power to ensure that even 50 years down the lane, the country’s people remember him as a leader who greatly benefitted them. Other Chinese political leaders have also taken responsibility for all Chinese people and have made significant reforms to create an environment for business, and for investment in new technology, such as AI and space technology. How do you assess China’s relationship with South Asian countries in general? We should not indulge in conflict. We need resolution and reconciliation with India in the border conflict. All the neighbouring countries, including Nepal, have no border conflict. Apart from India and Bhutan, China has no border conflict with our neighbouring countries. Bhutan is happy to sign a border contract with China, but maybe they are waiting for the message from New Delhi. China will not exert any pressure. It is reasonable for China to be silent about other countries’ internal affairs. Sometimes, the decisions of neighbouring countries are not suitable for China’s interests, but China often keeps quiet and waits for good things to happen. We don’t have any land ambition in our neighbouring countries; we have enough land. If so, why is there conflict in the South China Sea? We don’t have land ambition, so we don’t want an inch of land from other countries. At the same time, we are determined not to abandon an inch of our land.If you look at the United Nations P-5 countries, which are permanent security council members, China is the most prudent country in which decisions are not made by weapons. In South Asia, China-India relations have again started to improve. It's a good beginning. China's relations with other South Asian countries, including Nepal, are stable. China and India are ancient civilisations. We have enough power to solve our problems together. We don’t need a third party’s long hand. We don’t need this kind of teaching. We are brothers; if we have problems, we can solve them together. The best way to resolve the problem between China and India is to develop mutual political trust, security resolution, and economic cooperation, which I believe will happen. Thanks to the potential threat from Donald Trump’s reelection, the two leaders of China and India have used their political wisdom to make changes in advance and create a better atmosphere for the future. Apart from security, what are China’s other concerns in Nepal?The bottom line in China’s foreign policy with neighbouring countries is peace and stability. If you read the Chinese line, we admire mutual respect. We desire friendly countries to commit to ‘One China’. Second, China would also like to promote economic cooperation with Nepal. Not only with Nepal but also with all countries. We want a simple process of import and export, a good business environment, and transparency in law and policy. If the above-mentioned things are achieved, Chinese companies will dare to increase their investment [in Nepal]. Nepal has long been an adamant supporter of ‘One China policy’. But now it has also committed to uphold ‘One China principle’? What does this shift entail for Nepal?To be precise, there is no difference. China’s bottom line is principle; for our friends, that’s policy. If they accept the One China principle, they will conduct a One China policy, which means they will not develop official contact with Taiwan. Earlier in Nepal, there used to be a discourse that Nepal could be a bridge between India and China, but you have come up with a larger perspective that Nepal could not only be a door to South Asia but also to East Asia. Can you elaborate?We don’t say Nepal or any other country should do this or that. We say we expect something. Frankly, China and India are both robust in population, land mass, and economies. Additionally, India is a young country. China also has its own advantage. Nepal has been blocked geographically by these two countries. But Nepal can potentially be the hub, not limited to the periphery. At least in the next three decades, both China and India can offer the most attractive economic opportunities in the world. If Nepal treads cautiously, it can enjoy the benefit of its location. Geography is constant, but political geography is variable and changes.If China and India go against each other, it might be a nightmare for the Nepali people. But, if China-India come together, even if not like in the 1950s, to make a rational decision not to let the border conflict escalate and promote trade, Nepal can enjoy its location as the intermediary rather than as a bridge. Rather than a bridge, Nepal should be a port. In this way, Nepal can earn a lot with China and India because both countries should get permission from Nepal to use its ports to export and import the goods they want. Bring goods from China’s Tibet Autonomous Region to Nepal and then transit to India. Bring goods from Indian cities to Nepal and transit to China via Tibet Autonomous Region. It is a very short distance, and much better. China is never envious of Nepal and India’s bilateral ties. We will never put sand in the wheels of Kathmandu-New Delhi relations. We know you are friends. But don’t make the friendship exclusive; it should be inclusive.You mentioned that China does not meddle in the internal affairs of other countries. But China has tried to bring communist parties in Nepal together and has been holding ideological discussions with these parties. Isn’t this selective engagement a form of meddling?First, one should know that in China, “international affairs” (among the governments of sovereign countries) are handled by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (中华人民共和国外交部) under the central government, the same as in other countries. At the same time, “inter-party affairs” (between the CPC and all other friendly parties in the world) are handled by the International Department, Central Committee of CPC (中共中央对外联络部) within the Party system.The mission of both the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the International Department of the CPC Central Committee is to promote mutual understanding, friendship and cooperation between the Chinese government, the Communist Party of China and the Chinese people and governments, political parties and peoples of other countries, but the division of labor between the two is slightly different. There are some misreadings and misunderstandings.First, it said that the International Department of the CPC only communicates with communist or left-wing parties. That is wrong. In fact, the International Department speaks on behalf of the Communist Party of China and all political parties around the world that are friendly to China, including both the ruling and opposition parties.Second, it said that the International Department had contacts with opposition parties in other countries. This statement is also wrong. The International Department and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs have their own priorities. The ministry and the government agencies carry out diplomatic activities and naturally deal with the ruling parties of other countries.However, the International Department of the CPC Central Committee conducts exchanges with all political parties that are friendly to China, in line with international norms and practices. Everything is above board and conducive to mutual understanding, mutual trust and win-win cooperation between the two governments, two parties and two peoples.“Non-intervention in internal affairs” (不干涉他国内政) and “foreign affairs are not defined by ideology” (不以意识形态划线) are two major principles of the CPC and the Chinese government.As Sun Yeli, spokesman for the 20th National Congress of the Communist Party of China (CPC) said on October 15, 2022, the CPC maintains different forms of contacts with more than 600 political parties and organisations in more than 170 countries, and the international circle of friends is growing.“The more friends, the better.” As Sun Yeli said, for a long time, and on the basis of the principles of independence, complete equality, mutual respect and non-interference in each other's internal affairs, the Communist Party of China has had extensive exchanges with friendly political parties and political forces of other countries, and its international circle of friends has been growing.In recent years, China has hosted the World Political Party Leaders Summit and high-level Dialogue, attended by more than 500 leaders of political parties and organisations from over 160 countries and more than 10,000 political party representatives. The development of political party relations has driven and promoted the development of state-to-state relations and enhanced the understanding and friendship between the peoples.Sun Yeli said the CPC attaches importance to exchanges with Marxist political parties in other countries. Through theoretical exchanges and policy dialogue, they jointly explore the path of socialist development suitable for their respective national conditions and explore their respective paths to realise the localisation of Marxism.“The CPC's foreign affairs are not defined by ideology,” Sun said, adding that the CPC is willing to make friends with all kinds of political parties of all countries, irrespective of the ideology they uphold, as long as they are friendly to China and willing to conduct exchanges with the CPC.How is China seeing Nepal’s Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli’s Beijing visit, which will commence on December 2? Nepal’s prime minister, especially from the communist parties, often visits China. Big promises and agreements are made during the visits, but they seldom materialise. How hopeful is China about Prime Minister Oli’s visit this time?I am not a foreign ministry official. So I cannot represent the Chinese government. Over the past decade, China-Nepal relations have made remarkable progress. Political mutual trust between the two sides has steadily increased, and economic cooperation has yielded initial results. There is an old saying in China, “haste makes waste.” In other words, whether it is to develop bilateral relations or the economy through economic and trade cooperation, these things must conform to the objective economic conditions and cannot be rushed. Steady improvement and steady progress are the best. \nFormer Indian chief election commissioner SY Quraishi is a strong advocate of credible elections and inclusive democracy. He has extensively spoken and written on how increasing flow of money in elections is taking away the level playing field for candidates from different backgrounds. During his recent visit to Kathmandu, Binod Ghimire of the Post and Suresh Raj Neupane and Rajesh Mishra of Kantipur talked to him on a range of issues from electoral reforms, challenges in maintaining election sanctity in the age of generative artificial intelligence, to why the world is swinging right. Excerpts:Elections and democracy are intertwined. However, recent election results the world over are being seen as a threat to law and democracy. How do you see this phenomenon?Democracy and elections are two sides of the same coin. Without elections, there is no democracy. And worldwide, for the past 10 years, there is a swing towards the right, even in the US. In India, of course, we have been on the right for the past 10 years and our prime minister got a third term, though with a bit of reduced majority.The other thing is that in the past 10-12 years, there has been a debate on whether democracy is on a decline worldwide. The fact is that several indices of democracy indicate the decline. But people’s will cannot be taken as a threat to democracy. Sometimes they go to the left, sometimes, they move to the right. We cannot call it a threat to democracy. The democracy indices which I mentioned have a different classification.First, there are full democracies. Then there are flawed democracies. Third is hybrid democracies. The fourth is an authoritarian regime. So even in South Asia, we have one or two countries which are authoritarian, like Afghanistan and Pakistan. Their ranking keeps going up or down depending on the electoral and democratic performance. In India, the right-wing is ruling, but they lost some majority. They are now depending on two other parties, which are not considered right-wing. Of course, Trump got an absolute majority this time winning both popular vote and electoral votes. He also won both the houses. So, this is what can make him dictatorial. As it is, he is mercurial, and everybody is speculating how he is going to behave. Let’s wait and see.We can agree that people cannot be taken as a threat to democracy. But can we say that the elections, rather than complementing the spirit of democracy, are turning into tools to endorse majoritarianism?Well, people’s will is supreme. If they have chosen absolute governments, if they have given large majorities, you cannot blame the people. Many times a lot of money is being used in elections, and only the rich people get to win elections. In India, for instance, 93 percent of MPs who got elected are crorepatis [multi-millionaires]. Now, law provides for a ceiling on expenditure, so that level playing field is established, where you and I can also contest.But then, the ceiling on expenditure in India has one flaw—it is only for candidates, not political parties. This negates or neutralises the purpose of the ceiling. You can’t spend more than 1 crore, but your party can spend 20 crores on you. So where is the level playing field? Some people say there should be state funding of elections. I oppose the idea but recommend state funding of political parties. It is difficult to monitor election expenditure because of black money. Funding political parties with cheques is what I recommend because it is easy to monitor. So you think election management is more of a problem than the electoral system?Actually, both are important, because obviously the management follows what the system prescribes. There are laws, there are rules, and they have to be followed. For instance, on political funding, there is a cap on expenditure provided by law, and the election management body implements it. Therefore, we have to improve both. Both are equally important. We say public consciousness has increased with time, but there are also concerns that people are picking right-wing leaders. So what is wrong?Actually, it’s a good question but difficult to answer. Why is it that the whole world is turning right? But there are also states like Austria where everybody was thinking the extreme right was winning, but then liberals won. So, there are exceptions. Maybe people want a strong and stable government, which has the benefit of continuity. On the other hand, such a government can be accused of majoritarianism.I heard your prime minister, Oli-ji, mentioning frequent government changes. Obviously, how can the government function with this kind of instability? On the other hand there is the prime minister of India who has been elected for the third term. It is the people's choice, and you can't fault the people. The people chose stability and a strong government, and we have to respect that.Are people not knowledgeable enough to pick the right representatives for themselves?This question is often raised. For instance, we were talking about crorepatis and criminals in politics. Almost 46 percent of MPs in India have criminal cases against them. When we talk to these MPs, they say, look, people are choosing us, so how can you blame us? That way the blame is passed on to the people.Why is the electorate choosing dishonest people against whom there are criminal cases? This debate leads us nowhere. So obviously there is something good these people with criminal background must be doing in the constituency. Maybe they commit crime outside the constituency and like Robin Hood, benefit their own people.Aam Aadmi Party was a new party, and won 67 out of 70 seats in Delhi. They managed funds through crowdfunding and volunteers. And they won hands down.What are the issues that have come up with the proliferation of social media and new media?Social media and new media have revolutionised communication. But, initially, when the election commission of India in 2012 or 2013 came out with some regulation, there was a lot of public criticism, which was unjustified. Social media is also media. So whatever applies to media will apply to social media. And in the election context, what applies to the media? Two things: How much money are you spending on buying space in the newspaper and how much money are you paying to the TV channel?Therefore, how much money are you paying to Facebook or WhatsApp, you have to account for it as well. The law on expenditure will apply to social media also. The second concern was how will the election commission catch the violators, as they are anonymous. The difficulty in catching them cannot be an excuse for not taking cognisance of their offence. If we cannot catch them today, tomorrow we will. How can something be illegal in a newspaper and legal on social media?Rumours always play a big role in elections. Social media has multiplied the problem a thousand times. Within two, three minutes, your country can be burned by false, fake news. Social media however has many benefits. For instance, instead of buying space in the newspaper and TV channel, through WhatsApp or Twitter you can reach your audience in two seconds flat.So social media is a double-edged weapon, as was the consensus in the Kantipur Conclave. And, you know, it is like a knife. Is a knife good or bad? If you want to cut an apple, it is good. If you want to cut a man’s throat, it is bad. It depends how you use it. Now, artificial intelligence has given rise to even deep fakes. But AI has benefits too. Through artificial intelligence, impersonation can be stopped. Voting and logistics can be monitored. But there is so much fraud, deep fakes, and hate. So how do you catch them? That is something we have to be wary about. Frankly, I am worried because its dangers outweigh the benefits. We have to put our heads together globally to make sure artificial intelligence doesn’t overtake human intelligence for destructive ends.In Nepal, both federal and provincial elections happen at once. India too is now mulling ‘one nation, one election’. What is your take on this?There are benefits and there are problems. Logistically, it makes sense. But one MP of Odisha posed this question: ask the people. What do they want? Poor people love frequent elections because this is the only way they can highlight their importance. Otherwise, how many times have we seen that posters are put up in a constituency with headings like ‘Missing’, or ‘Wanted’ [representatives]? Frequent elections make the representatives accountable.We heard you say that if India does ‘one nation, one election’, that will be the presidential election. What do you mean?During parliamentary elections, there are national and international issues. The issues are different in Parliament [national], Vidhan Sabha [state-level] and Panchayat [local]. I would like to say that the local body elections are as important, perhaps more important because they’re closer to the people.India’s prime minister initially said that there would be a national debate and a consensus would be reached. There was a debate for 10 years, but there was no consensus.If there was no consensus, the idea should have been dropped. But the government decided unilaterally that we will go ahead and set up a committee led by the former president of India to suggest ways to implement ‘one nation, one election’. In my articles I have questioned the propriety of a former president being drawn into a government committee.They have made some questionable recommendations. They say that simultaneous will mean Vidhan Sabha and Lok Sabha, not Panchayat. But the terms of reference clearly say that simultaneous means all three tiers. Then it says Panchayat elections can be held after 100 days. After 100 days, there is a separate election. It’s a new election and will require totally different arrangements. These are also not simultaneous elections.  \nThe Meteorological Forecasting Division has forecast light snowfall in one or two places in the hilly regions of Karnali and Sudurpaschim provinces. Some areas in the hilly regions of these provinces may also experience light rain. Similarly, the Tarai regions of Karnali and Sudurpaschim are likely to witness light to moderate rainfall. The weather is expected to remain clear during the day in the Himalayan, hilly, and Tarai regions of Koshi, Madhesh, and Bagmati provinces. However, partial to moderate cloud cover is anticipated in the Tarai regions of these provinces at night. Gandaki and Lumbini provinces are likely to experience partially cloudy weather today. \nThe Meteorological Forecasting Division has said that the country is currently experiencing the partial influence of a western disturbance and a low-pressure system. As of now, hilly regions are partly to generally cloudy, while the rest of the country remains partly cloudy to mostly clear. Some areas of the Tarai are covered with fog or mist. This afternoon, hilly areas of Gandaki and Koshi provinces are expected to have partly cloudy to mainly clear skies, with mostly clear weather predicted for the rest of the country. Tonight, hilly regions of Sudurpaschim, Karnali, Lumbini, and Gandaki provinces will experience partly to generally cloudy skies, while other areas will remain mostly clear. Light snowfall is expected in one or two high-altitude locations in Gandaki Province. \nSeveral provinces, including Sudurpaschim, Karnali, Lumbini, and Gandaki, will witness light to moderate rainfall starting Friday night as moisture-laden westerly wind enters the country from the Mediterranean Sea.The Kathmandu valley will also witness light rainfall on Saturday due to the western disturbances, the Meteorological Forecasting Division of the Department of Hydrology and Meteorology said.“Sudurpaschim and Karnali Province will witness light to moderate rainfall. Lumbini, Gandaki Province, will receive light rain,” said Saroj Pudasaini, a meteorologist at the division. “Hilly and mountainous areas of Gandaki Province will witness snowfall.”Meteorologists say that the western disturbance is a phenomenon that affects the weather patterns of the Indian subcontinent, including Nepal. It is a low-pressure system that originates in the Mediterranean region and moves eastward.“Western parts of the country will be affected much, and the weather system will become weak when it moves eastward,” said Binod Pokhrel, an associate professor at the Central Department of Hydrology and Meteorology. “Even if rain does not occur in the eastern part, the day will remain cloudy on Saturday.”The rain is expected to bring relief from rising air pollution. Met officials say the temperature will decline further due to the rain. Kathmandu Valley witnessed scattered rainfall on Tuesday evening, but due to cloudy conditions, the minimum temperature did not fall much on Wednesday morning.According to the Met Office, the minimum temperature of the Valley was recorded 6.7 degrees Celsius on Wednesday morning.The weather will improve from Sunday. \nThe Meteorological Forecasting Division has said that western disturbances and a low-pressure system are currently influencing Nepal. Madhesh, Lumbini, Bagmati, and Gandaki provinces are experiencing generally cloudy conditions, while other parts of the country have partial to clear skies. Fog and mist were observed in a few locations in the Tarai and the Kathmandu Valley this morning. Light snowfall is expected in some high hilly and Himalayan areas, with fog or mist likely in the Tarai and the Valley during the early hours.   \n\nBe elaborative as possible. I need more text.

Write it in the form of inspiring story not news article or event.\n    \n    Story:\nOnce upon a time, nestled between the towering peaks of the Himalayas and the lush jungles of the Terai, there was a country named Nepal. Though still a developing nation, Nepal was a land of profound beauty and deep-rooted cultural heritage. The residents of Nepal faced many challenges, but beneath these hardships lay a resilient spirit and an unyielding hope for the future.\n\nThis enchanting land, where Mount Everest reaches towards the skies and the air carries a mix of incense and cool mountain breezes, was more than a geographical marvel. It was a mosaic of cultures, languages, and traditions, a testament to human endeavor against all odds. Nepal's history, from the unification under King Prithvi Narayan Shah to its transformation into a federal democratic republic, told a story of aspiration and endurance.\n\nIn recent years, the people of Nepal, with their indomitable will, had taken strides towards rebuilding and reimagining their country. They turned their struggles into stepping stones, each challenge a chapter in their ongoing saga. The shift from a monarchy to a republic had not only changed governance but had woven a new tapestry of democratic values and collective decision-making.\n\nEconomically, while agriculture continued to sustain a large part of its population, Nepal had begun to harness the potential of its picturesque landscapes, developing sustainable tourism that promised to preserve their natural heritage while boosting local economies. Communities living in the shadows of the Himalayas had become stewards of the earth, protecting the biodiversity that made their country unique.\n\nEach day brought new stories. Whether it was a festival in Kathmandu, a technological advance in Pokhara, or a conservation effort in Chitwan, these events were threads in the vibrant quilt of Nepali life. These stories, updated daily, reflected the pulse of progress and the spirit of hope that characterized this resilient nation.\n\nAnd so, as Nepal moved forward, each moment was not just a passage of time but a promise of potential, a narrative of a nation perennially climbing towards tomorrow, guided by the legacy of its past and the dreams of its future.\n\nNews events:\nLocal government representatives on Friday demanded Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli implement the National Coordination Council’s previous decisions and call its third meeting to discuss coordination issues among the three tiers of government.Submitting a memorandum to the prime minister, representatives of the National Association of Rural Municipalities in Nepal (NARMIN), the Municipal Association of Nepal (MuAN) and the Association of District Coordination Committees of Nepal urged him to take steps to make federalism more functional.The first meeting of the council led by then-prime minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal in June last year had made six decisions. But most of those decisions made after two days of discussions between the representatives of all tiers of governments remain unaddressed.Removing ambiguity and duplication in the implementation of laws among the three tiers; cooperating while making laws related to concurrent powers; and formulating and implementing laws essential for federalism’s successful implementation were the key decisions made by the first meeting.Likewise, improving human resource management and service delivery; guaranteeing a minimum two-year posting for chief executive officers of local governments and a one-year posting for provincial employees; and streamlining the process of land acquisition required for subnational infrastructure construction, were the other decisions from the first meeting.The Federation, Province and Local Level (Coordination and Inter-relation) Act, 2020 envisions an annual council meeting annually. However, it has met only twice so far.“Other than demanding that the council’s meeting be called, we have also cautioned him not to cut down on the equalisation grants as was done last year,” said Laxmi Devi Pande, NARMIN chairperson. The Dahal administration last year cut one fourth of the equalisation grants allocated through the national budget, prompting the representatives of the local units to resort to protest. More than 150 chiefs and deputy chiefs of local units staged a sit-in on the Finance Ministry’s premises in December last year, compelling the federal government to partially release the grants. “Around 93 percent of the grant was released after our protest,” said Kalanidhi Devkota, executive director at MuAN. “We don’t want the federal government to make the same mistake.” Local governments get budgets from the federal level as equalisation grants, conditional grants, special grants and revenue-sharing. Equalisation grants are discretionary, allowing local governments/units to allocate funds as needed. Local governments, for a long time, have been demanding a review of the revenue-sharing model. Of the total revenue collected through the Value Added Tax (VAT) and customs, local and provincial governments receive 15 percent each, while the rest goes into the federal coffers. Similarly, the federal government holds 50 percent of the revenue collected through other sources, while the other two tiers of government receive 25 percent each.Devkota said they also requested Oli to authorise local governments to handle land registration and land surveys, as envisioned by the constitution. They also asked him to ensure the National Land Commission expedites its work, stating that the frequent making and unmaking of commissions by different governments has created obstacles in settling land-related problems. The Oli government in October revived the commission, which had been dissolved by the erstwhile Dahal administration. This is the 16th such commission formed since the restoration of democracy in 1990 to distribute land to the landless. Oli said he was positive about calling the council’s meeting on a date convenient for everyone, according to Devkota. “The prime minister also said the federal government will be generous in budget allocations to the local level,” he said. \nIn a bid to determine the clade of the mpox (monkeypox) virus, the Ministry of Health and Population is preparing to send specimens from infected persons to the World Health Organisation’s collaborating centre in Thailand.A clade is a subtype, genotype or group of viruses that originates from a common ancestor. So far, three clades of mpox viruses—clade I, clade IIa and cladeIIb—have been identified.Officials say clade identification tells the virus’s virulence and transmissibility of the virus, which is necessary to curb the further spread of deadly disease. As the country lacks a system to carry out virus sub-typing, it sought help from the UN health body. “We will probably send the specimen taken directly from the rash—skin fluid or crusts collected from the infected person—to the World Health Organisation’s collaborating centre in Thailand for clade identification,” said Dr Hemanta Chandra Ojha, an official at the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division. “Identification of the virus’ clade will help us to figure out what extra measures are needed to mitigate the risks of further spread.”Mpox is a rare disease caused by infection with the mpox virus. Last week, Nepal confirmed its second mpox case. A 36-year-old man from Tanahun, who returned from Saudi Arabia on December 19, tested positive for the disease. The country confirmed its first case of mpox infection in June last year when a 60-year-old foreign national tested positive.Experts say clade I, which is present in the Congo basin, causes up to 10 percent human mortality and is transmitted by rodents, although human-to-human transmission has also been recorded. Clade IIa, which exists in West Africa, has a low mortality rate, but clade IIb is currently spreading globally through human transmission. Clade IIb was responsible for infection in the first mpox case in Nepal.According to Ojha, the health condition of the infected person is normal, and he could be discharged from the hospital in a few days.With the confirmation of the second mpox case in Nepal, health authorities have stepped up surveillance measures to prevent a possible outbreak of the deadly viral disease.Along with stepping up screening of passengers entering the country via the Tribhuvan International Airport, health authorities have requested dermatologists throughout the country to refer suspected cases for testing.“We have also deployed health workers at the health desk at Pokhara International Airport and screened passengers who arrived from China for the dragon boat festival,” said Ojha. “We also conducted an orientation for health workers serving in strategic locations.”Public health experts in Nepal say that screening suspects at health desks at international airports and land crossings is not sufficient to prevent outbreaks, as the first symptoms of mpox can take between five and 21 days for the first symptoms of mpox to appear, and not all cases can be detected at health desks.Monkeypox cases have been reported in neighbouring India, with which Nepal shares a long, porous border. India has recorded at least 30 mpox infections since 2022.Health experts say that even though mpox is usually mild and most people recover within weeks, the risks should not be underestimated. They stress the importance of precautions, saying that any disease seen in any corner of the world can reach Nepal due to the high mobility of people.Mpox has been a neglected public health problem in parts of Africa for decades. The disease came to widespread attention after May 2022, when countries outside Africa began reporting new cases.Since then, mpox has spread globally. More than 100,000 people from 122 countries have already tested positive for the disease.Its symptoms include fever, headache, swelling, body aches, exhaustion, and itchy rashes on the face, hands, and feet.As the disease primarily spreads through close person-to-person contact, public health experts recommend self-isolation and good hygiene to prevent transmission. \nMicro, cottage and small industries (MCSEs) are the foundation of the local economy as they help increase per capita income, create jobs, and provide income opportunities for the low- and medium-bracket population.The government has implemented a new policy to increase their contribution to the national economy and make them competitive.The Cabinet meeting on December 13 approved the policy.As per the policy, an entrepreneur-oriented environment will be created to boost production along its value chain.“Coordination among federal, provincial and local governments will be made for developing and promoting micro, cottage and small-scale industries,” the policy document says.The policy also includes mainstreaming marginalised communities and the area. To promote an entrepreneurial culture, improvements in the educational system will be made to produce industrial manpower, according to the policy.“At a time when MCSEs are struggling to remain afloat after being hit by the Covid-19 pandemic, the policy is expected to boost their morale,” said Narendra Kumar Khadka, chairperson of the cottage and small industry committee at the Federation of Nepalese Chambers of Commerce and Industry. “However, effective policy implementation is questionable due to frequent changes in government.”But for now, at least, the policy has come, said Khadka. “We are hopeful.” The policy also includes increasing the export of goods produced by MCSEs and talks about strengthening the traditional handicraft industry and making it export-oriented.Khadka said that the policy was introduced after discussing it with the stakeholders.Private sector leaders say the development of MCSEs depends on the political situation.Experts say there are many challenges: the country’s economy is crawling, business confidence is low, the cost of operating the industry is staggeringly high, and India is imposing export restrictions.“Almost all raw materials for domestic industries need to be imported from India or China or from third countries. MCSEs suffer due to an unfriendly customs regime and high taxes,” said Khadka.According to the policy, to link MCSEs in the value chain, a forward and backward linkage with medium and large-scale industries will be created.The policy highlighted that MCSEs currently face weak infrastructure, a lack of skilled manpower, incapacity to adopt modern technology and restrictions on accessing market and finance.Similarly, there is a lack of effective coordination between federal, provincial and local levels. Different MCSE policies and delays in implementing industrial and investment promotion funds are setbacks for business promotion.Easing the industry registration process, making enterprise advice services and technology available, providing training, and subsidising loans are the few suggestions the policy has mentioned to boost MCSEs. A report entitled Small and Medium-Sized Enterprise Monitor, published by the Asian Development Bank in December 2021, says 33.1 percent of MCSEs use inheritance wealth or ancestral properties while 25.8 percent use income and savings for initial financing for their business.About 85 percent of workers in Nepal are informal. Most MCSEs are engaged in services and operate in rural areas; only a few cater to international markets, although their impact on exports varies by the country.Access to bank credit remains limited for MCSEs, with just 16 percent going to banks and financial institutions.The Micro, Small, and Medium-sized Enterprises’ Access to Finance in Nepal report, released by the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific in 2020, states that MCSEs contribute 22 percent to Nepal's GDP.According to the Central Bureau of Statistics, almost half of all business establishments are unregistered, and more than 90 percent of workers in MCSEs with fewer than 10 employees have informal employee relationships.The National Economic Census 2018 shows that 923,356 establishments were operating in Nepal, and around a half were registered. The MCSEs sector—which includes 69.3 percent micro-enterprises, 25.2 percent small enterprises, and 5.5 percent medium-sized enterprises—employs 2.74 million people.To boost Nepal’s development, the importance of businesses as primary contributors to growth cannot be overstated. For businesses to reach their full potential and contribute to overall national economic growth, experts say ensuring an enabling environment for them to prosper is fundamental.The new policy prioritises utilising knowledge and skills from returnee migrant workers.“To implement policy, equal support from all three tiers of government, private sector, development partners, and aid agencies are needed,” the policy reads.The Micro, Cottage and Small Scale Industry Promotion Centre will be the main agent responsible for implementing the policy. The Ministry of Industry, Commerce and Supplies will support and facilitate the centre for policy implementation. \nLocal pro Niraj Tamang won the title of the Surya Nepal Eastern Open, the third event under Surya Nepal Golf Tour 2024-25, matching the tournament record with a scintillating 17-under 193, at the par-70 Dharan Golf Club on Friday.Tamang carded 5-under 65 in the third and final round to secure an emphatic 10-stroke victory over Bishnu Prasad Sharma and win his second major career title and a cheque of Rs150,000.Tamang had also broken the course record with 8-under 62 on the first day.Both records were previously held by fellow Dharan pro Sukra Bahadur Rai on his way to winning the title in the 2022-23 season.Sharma, who was seven strokes behind Tamang going into the final round, carded 2-under 68 for a total score of 7-under 203.

He was sixth overall. He recorded 2-stroke victory over Sundar Rai, who carded 1-under 69 to finish second at 1-over 211.Winner Tamang equaled the 17-under record score after he carded 5-under 31 on the front nine. He made a flying start with birdies on the first three holes and added two more on the sixth and ninth before the turn. He dropped three shots on the first two holes of the back nine. Tamang faced a double bogey on the 10th after he hit the tee shot into the jungle and then found the hazard with the second shot before taking a penalty shot. He also dropped a shot on the 11th hole. Tamang recovered well to maintain the score with birdies on the 12th, 13th and 17th holes and finished the back nine at even-par 34. He had a chance to break the record after he drove the ball into the bunker on the left side of the 18th green but he ended up with a top-shot and found another bunker. He hit a brilliant shot from the bunker to settle for a par and equal the record.Sharma carded 4-under 32 on the front nine after he carded four birdies on the third, fifth, sixth and ninth holes. But he played 2-over 36 on the back nine after he faced four birdies on the 13th, 14th, 16th and 17th holes against two birdies on the 15th and 18th holes. Former winner, Rai took the turn at even-par 26 after he faced bogeys on the first and fourth holes against birdies on the sixth and ninth holes. He carded a birdie on the 11th hole and dropped shots on the 13th and 16th holes for 1-over 35 on the back nine.A total of 56 golfers, including 29 pros and 27 amateurs, took part in the 54-hole tournament that carried a cash purse of Rs 882,000. All pros in top 21 received their share of cash prizes. The tournament will end on Saturday with a Pro-Am event. \nReading ‘Nervous Conditions’ reminded me of Maya Angelou saying, “I am not free while any woman is unfree, even when her shackles are very different from my own.” Tsitsi Dangarembga’s novel is about a similar truth. It resonates with the lives of the female characters—Tambu, Nyasha, Maiguru, Lucia, and Tambu’s mother. Their struggles reflect the universal experiences of women bounded by societal and familial expectations.This novel is a landmark in postcolonial literature, capturing the tension between tradition and modernity, personal freedom and familial duty. Narrated by Tambu, the story begins with a striking personal anecdote: “My brother’s death was a relief.” Yet, this is not a story about death—it is about her escape. The book is a tale of survival, resilience, and the price women pay for breaking free.The story compels readers to question whether the struggles faced by women stem more from colonial oppression or deeply entrenched patriarchal domination. Through Tambu’s mother, the novel portrays the crushing weight of being a woman in such a society. She tells her daughter, “The business of women is a heavy burden…with the poverty of blackness on one side and the weight of womanhood on the other.”Her words encapsulate the triple marginalisation—by race, gender, and class—faced by African women. Yet, like mothers everywhere, Tambu’s mother supports her pursuit of education and dreams despite her struggles. She understands that offering Tambu this chance, even at the risk of failure, is a quiet act of rebellion against societal norms. It highlights the resilience of women, even within oppressive structures.Determined to escape her family’s poverty, Tambu fights fiercely for her right to education. However, her journey is fraught with challenges, including her father’s belief that educating girls is futile. This reflects women’s sacrifices to carve out their space in a patriarchal world. Through her uncle Babamukuru, she learns, “These children who can go to school today are the ones whose family will prosper tomorrow,” highlighting how education becomes a means of survival—not just for Tambu but for her entire family.Nyasha, Tambu’s cousin, is a multifaceted character. Throughout the novel, she stands out as the most sensible individual but later succumbs to the strain caused by the clash between colonial influence and traditional values. Having been raised in England, Nyasha struggles to align with her family's expectations upon returning to Zimbabwe. Her outspokenness and refusal to conform unsettle her father, Babamukuru, who embodies the novel's patriarchal ideals of discipline and control.Although courageous, Nyasha’s rebellious actions lead to her mental breakdown, highlighting the toll of societal expectations. Her poignant observation, “They’ve trapped us… I’m not one of them, but I’m not one of you,” underscores her existential crisis. Ultimately, she becomes a victim of generational trauma and systemic oppression. Torn between two cultures, Nyasha’s struggles underscore the pervasive nature of patriarchy, which transcends culture, class, and geography, rendering women like her powerless to escape its grip.Maiguru, Babamukuru’s wife, embodies another layer of oppression in the novel. Despite being educated, she sacrifices her career and independence to fulfil her duties as a wife and mother. Her lament, “Does anyone appreciate the sacrifices I made? As for me, no one even thinks about the things I gave up,” echoes the struggles of countless women whose contributions remain undervalued within patriarchal family structures, such as those in Nepal. The novel contrasts Maiguru’s quiet suffering with Nyasha’s open refusal to comply, yet ultimately reveals that both women remain trapped within the same oppressive system. Their experiences underscore that education alone cannot liberate women without broader societal change.Lucia, Tambu’s outspoken aunt, defies traditional norms by refusing to marry and asserting her independence. Her boldness and refusal to conform sharply contrast with Tambu’s mother, who has internalised her oppression. This dynamic is painfully evident during Tambu’s mother’s forced participation in a humiliating re-marriage ceremony organised by Babamukuru, highlighting how women are often stripped of their dignity in the name of tradition.As Tambu grows, she understands the extent of women's oppression. She observes, \"The victimisation was universal; it didn’t depend on poverty, education, or tradition. Men took it everywhere with them.\" This includes men like Babamukuru, who, despite being well-educated and having seen both the inside and outside of his country, still perpetuates oppression. Tambu's realisation points to the novel’s central question: Is the problem the influence of Englishness, or is it the men who sustain oppression within the family?The novel does not offer easy answers. While colonialism does contribute to women's issues, it is clear that patriarchy exists independently and is often prioritised by both men and women. Babamukuru, despite his role as the family’s provider and hero, values strict gender roles, illustrating how even well-meaning men promote inequality.As Babamukuru states, \"Providing money for school fees is good, but it is not all that must be done to ensure a child’s success in school. A child must also be provided with the correct atmosphere to encourage his mind to develop even when not in the classroom.\" However, he fails to apply this approach to his daughter, Nyasha, whose emotional and intellectual needs are neglected simply because of her gender. Furthermore, using his wife’s salary for familial purposes highlights this contradiction. These contradictions reveal how Dangarembga honestly portrays patriarchy, showing that it operates not only through direct oppression but also through subtle, everyday actions and attitudes, reinforcing gender inequality even among those who claim to act in the best interests of women.This novel is a powerful exploration of women’s lives under the dual oppression of colonialism and patriarchy. The title ‘Nervous Condition’ captures the psychological toll of living under such systems, which is taken from Frantz Fanon’s description of the colonised mind. It forces readers to confront uncomfortable truths about power, gender, and identity, making it challenging to reflect on the structures that define our lives and how we might begin to break them down.For Nepali readers, the novel offers a powerful reflection of our societal struggles, where women often bear the triple burden of poverty, gender, and societal expectations. Ultimately, Dangarembga’s narrative reminds us that the fight for freedom is ongoing and that liberation is not just a personal journey but a collective responsibility.____Nervous ConditionsAuthor: Tsitsi DangarembgaPublisher: The Women's PressYear: 1988Pages: 204 \nThe ruling coalition in Madhesh Province is divided over the method of implementing provincial government projects, with some parties advocating for competitive bidding while others support execution through consumer committees.Although the province’s policies and budget statement emphasised conducting large-scale development projects through open competitive bidding and transferring smaller projects to local governments, differences have emerged within the coalition.The Janamat Party-led government had initially aimed to implement projects transparently by adopting competitive bidding to prevent irregularities, halt project trading, and ensure quality construction work. However, disagreements among coalition leaders have stalled progress.Janamat Party parliamentary leader in Mahesh, Yadav explained that discussions during a coalition meeting convened on Friday by Nepali Congress leader Krishna Prasad Yadav focused on the government’s responsibilities.“Leaders proposed that smaller projects should be implemented through consumer committees, while the budget framework prioritised competitive bidding. The meeting ended inconclusively,” Yadav said.The coalition meeting included leaders from the Nepali Congress, the CPN-UML, the Loktantrik Samajbadi Party, and the Janamat Party.The province’s policy document (Clause 21) and budget statement (Clause 147) stress the implementation of development projects via open and competitive bidding to ensure transparency and foster a sense of ownership among beneficiaries. Small-scale public construction projects are to be executed through local governments, with citizen-led facilitation mechanisms enhancing transparency.However, the Ministry of Physical Infrastructure Development has prepared guidelines to implement projects through consumer committees, disregarding the policies passed by the provincial assembly. These guidelines, approved by the Ministry of Finance, have further deepened the division within the coalition. \nThe frequency of earthquakes in Nepal’s Sudurpaschim province has significantly increased, with the Bajura district alone recording 16 tremors since October 2022. This past Saturday, a 5.2-magnitude quake that shook the district inflicted huge damage in Jagannath Rural Municipality. According to official data, 108 houses were destroyed while 460 saw minor damages. In addition, public infrastructure such as 24 schools, 11 health posts, and all six ward offices in the rural municipality were hit. Thankfully, no human casualties were reported.However, the fact that 50 families in the severely affected Darji settlement are now living under tarpaulins is concerning. The authorities are still collecting data on the damage in order to distribute additional relief materials. Unfortunately, in the wake of earthquakes, people also die due to delays in distributing housing aid. Conditions worsen in the biting winter cold, as tents do not provide people with enough warmth. Lest we forget, when a 6.4 magnitude earthquake struck the Jajarkot district last year, almost 35 earthquake-displaced individuals succumbed to the cold. People are also vulnerable in such temporary shelters, as there are concerns over security and sanitation. These places also become hotspots for communicable diseases.Even though the state’s post-quake recovery programmes have been somewhat satisfactory in the country, long-term solutions to mitigate the severity of this natural occurrence are still lacking, as are provisions to ensure the bare minimum in temporary shelters. Due to frequent jolts, most houses in earthquake-affected areas of the province—Jajarkot, Rukum West, Rukum East, Salyan, Rolpa, Nawalparasi East, Dailekh, Baitadi, Jumla, Kalikot and Pyuthan districts—are either fully damaged or at high risk. In many cases, the disaster victims go back to damaged houses as temporary huts cannot protect them. Yet, budgetary provisions for the construction of permanent ones are inadequate. According to the Temporary Housing Construction Grant Procedures for Earthquake-2023, the federal government provides only Rs50,000 in two tranches to each house that is completely or partially damaged—an insufficient amount to rebuild safe, earthquake-resistant homes. Similarly, the jolts have damaged the old and traditional houses made of mud and stones that do not adhere to engineering standards and the National Building Code.Experts point to the necessity of encouraging quake victims to retrofit their houses by providing a certain grant alongside those for building new houses. Scientific studies indicate that the frequent tremors in Sudurpaschim Province are signs of accumulating tectonic stress and that a massive temblor cannot be ruled out. It is high time our authorities at all levels became alert, expedited furnishing works on old homes and enforced strict building codes. It is also vital to prepare for disasters beforehand, examine whether houses are inhabitable, and spread awareness on the importance of earthquake-resilient houses. Apart from these long-term solutions, officials must give up their wait-and-see approach to disaster management and help quake victims in Bajura in building permanent homes with adequate budgets and resources. Clean water, nutritious food, sanitation facilities and sufficient warm clothes should be ensured while victims are in tents. Deployment of health teams to assess and address potential disease outbreaks in temporary camps is crucial too. No more lives should be lost because of very preventable post-disaster mismanagement. \nNepal’s research landscape includes a variety of non-governmental organisations that I like to call academic NGOs. They come in various sizes and shapes and work on multiple fronts: Doing research and providing various types of research training. They run labs and libraries and organise conferences, seminars and workshops. Their works also include publishing reports, bibliographies, newsletters, journals, research and policy briefs, and books of various types.The research these organisations conduct also varies in type. Some engage in basic research in the sciences or social sciences, while others focus on policy research and interventions. Some do commissioned research (also known as consultancies). Others respond to public calls for bids but do not do commissioned research. Still others design their own research projects and then search for funding to carry them out. Since sources of funding available for such entities are rather scarce within the country, such funds, when these organisations are successful, are often sourced from international foundations and donor agencies. Academic NGOs are important to Nepal’s higher education and research landscape. They will continue to remain so in the foreseeable future.Regulatory rigmaroleGiven that Nepal’s laws do not differentiate between academic NGOs and other service-providing NGOs, the former have to comply with the same set of regulations that have been put in place for civil society organisations that mostly deliver bikas in the form of tangible materials and services. All NGOs have to renew their registration annually at the Chief District Office in the district where they are registered. If they access non-Nepali sources of funds, they also have to register at the Social Welfare Council (SWC) and get prior approval for each funded project by filling out elaborate applications. SWC is a legacy of how the Panchayat regime governed a small number of civil society organisations prior to 1990. In recent years, its approval process has involved getting prior permission from the local governments (mostly metropolitan offices) of the areas where the project will be implemented before the application is even registered at the SWC. All this involves many weeks of administrative work that frankly detracts from the main knowledge production and distribution work of the academic NGOs. Over the years, many of us have tried to point out the absurdities of such regulations. To give you one example, if a research project involves surveys in 30 local government areas, the concerned academic NGO is expected to get approval from all such entities. There cannot be a good justification for such an approval regime if we are really committed to the ideal of freedom of thought and expression enshrined in the country’s constitution. To give a second example, until recently, the guidelines of SWC used to suggest that project budgets should be spent mostly on “hardware” (also known as tangible bikas items) and not “software” (namely, salary for researchers). In a typical research project, the heaviest expense would be the remuneration for researchers and their associates. In other words, research happens by investing on the “software”. Thankfully, this absurd rule has been relaxed for research projects. Multiple-constituency accountabilityThe right to set the research agenda is synonymous with the fundamental right to freedom of thought and expression in any loktantrik polity. Work by academic NGOs is built upon two constitutionally guaranteed fundamental freedoms: The right to freedom of thought and expression and the right to organise. Organising research through academic NGOs is just a joint execution of these two rights as mentioned in our constitution.Does that mean academic NGOs should not be accountable to anybody? Sure they do. Knowledge production is a service just like the construction of health clinics or school buildings. However, there is a major difference. Since much of what happens during knowledge production and distribution cannot be shown in a tangible way, it is much harder to publicly show the results of this particular service. In this context, as I pointed out in a 2011 article published in the journal Dhaulagiri Journal of Sociology and Anthropology (volume 5), thinking about the accountability of academic NGOs in terms of multiple constituencies is useful.First, academic NGOs are accountable to their members, their funders and the Government of Nepal for the money they receive for any specific research project or general institutional support. This is accountability in monetary terms and the hisab has to be accurate. However, the money approval regime has to be made much more flexible. The requirement to get prior approval for each project from local governments and, in the case of foreign funding, from the SWC, should be removed. Other laws governing the transfer of money from outside of Nepal should be adequate to cover the transactions involving foreign funds. These NGOs can be required to make their annual audited reports (passed by their general bodies) public. They can also be required to submit a copy of such reports to the registering entity of the Government of Nepal each year but the need for their annual renewal should be done away with. Second, academic NGOs are chiefly accountable to their peers in similar organisations, other types of research centres and universities for the quality and integrity of their research. These peers are the ones who are most qualified to evaluate if the research output of these organisations is intellectually sound and methodologically competent and adds to our general repository of knowledge. Traditions of research and scholarship have been built around this notion of peer accountability inside and outside universities for a long time, and they should also apply to academic NGOs. This means the sham of government bureaucrats and their consultants doing mid-term and full-term evaluations of research projects and their outputs should be stopped. Finally, academic NGOs are also responsible to the general public and its unelected representatives (e.g., journalists) for all aspects of the research operation, including ethical considerations even when there are no formally established protocols for the same. This means they should be open to and encourage all forms of public scrutiny as is appropriate for all public institutions in a loktantrik polity. As I emphasised in my 2011 article, being accountable to these various constituencies is essential if academic NGOs want to be seen as credible players in the academic landscape, both nationally and internationally. Credibility is not earned simply by highlighting the legality of academic NGOs as civil society associations. It can only be earned with a track record established through a consistent commitment to the process of knowledge production and the quality of the end products—books, journals, policy papers and the like—and through the following of the accountability regimes described here.    \nFollowing the issuance of the concept paper on the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) by the technical committee formed by the Ministry of Communication and Information Technology on July 3, 2024, law practitioners and leaders of the judiciary have directed their attention to AI in the administration of justice. Until now, the law, legal logic and legal reasoning have largely been the products of human conscience and history. Still, concerns remain about balancing human intelligence and AI. However, integrating AI into the administration of justice will be a distant dream until we carefully consider AI’s complementary role rather than using it entirely as an alternative to human judgment in the legal system.The development of AI tools is one of the most revolutionary and powerful phenomena of the 21st century and can potentially transform the fate of the judiciary. It can process vast amounts of data with remarkable speed, handle routine administrative tasks like the automatic publishing of cause lists and even help with automisation, which the Nepal Bar Association and reformists of the judiciary have sought to do since Cholendra Shumsher Rana was the chief justice. It can also offer insights and predictions based on the analysis of available data. For example, AI can modernise case management by automating document review and scheduling. Legal research can also be swiftly enhanced by processing and reprocessing relevant precedents and statutes. AI can significantly improve efficiency and accuracy by reducing backlogs (menace to the judiciary) and aiding in the speedy delivery of justice. The human intelligence Understanding and reinstating that the law is a product of social experience and human conscience is important. Despite all the scientific advancements and the potential of AI, it cannot replace human intelligence. Legal practice is not limited to processing information. It also involves interpreting laws within socio-cultural contexts, human experiences, and ethical considerations. When interpreting laws and legal principles, judges and legal professionals empathise, employ moral reasoning, and develop legal logic with cultural sensitivity, abilities that AI lacks. Human judgment remains essential in Nepal, as cultural and social dynamics are deeply ingrained in legal processes. Overcoming challenges Integrating AI into Nepal’s judicial system presents several challenges. The absence of an organised database is a major concern. Unorganised and scattered data restrict the optimal use of AI, which prevents us from gaining the highest returns. Furthermore, the development of AI is West-centric. This will also likely limit its implementation in Nepal’s judicial system. Therefore, Nepal must focus on developing a system for organising data, and AI developers should consider eliminating barriers that hinder AI’s functionality. The concern that AI algorithms may be biased cannot be dismissed. AI systems may reinforce or amplify biases present in earlier data if trained. Since Nepal’s judiciary handles private and sensitive data, data security and privacy concerns are crucial when integrating AI into the judiciary. So, creating a strong legal framework is a prerequisite to safeguarding data privacy and guaranteeing the ethical application of AI. Collaborative framework Developing a collaborative approach where human intelligence benefits in legal reasoning with AI’s assistance is essential. Decision-making and interpretation of law must solely be the subject of human judges’ conscience, whereas AI can play its role in data-driven insights and completing routine tasks, such as automating cause lists. This collaborative approach requires a shift in the perspective of legal practitioners. They must be trained to interpret the data and insights generated by AI tools. Their skills must be encouraged to maintain humanness in administering justice while using AI outputs. Lack of critical interpretation of AI data may lead to fake citations of resources and literature, as happened in a case from the US, where the respondent submitted a non-existent judicial opinion with fake quotes and citations created by ChatGPT. Before embracing AI into Nepal’s judicial system, training AI on local data, such as case laws in the Nepali language, is imperative. Safeguarding against data theft, sensible implementation of AI, and rigorous dialogue with stakeholders will enhance the capacity of the judicial system and those involved in justice delivery. It is safe to assert that the future of the judicial system in Nepal depends on how well the authorities manage to use AI. The right balance of human intelligence and AI will make the judicial system fairer and more accessible. We must embrace innovations in a way that upholds the values of our legal system.  \nWith the ruling parties—the Nepali Congress and the CPN-UML—starting the groundwork for the review and amendment of the constitution, the debate over the whole process is heating up. The ruling forces have rightly taken the initiative to implement the pledge they made while forming the coalition government over five months ago. They justified the ‘unusual coalition’ of two largest political parties saying it was the ‘only way’ the constitution could be amended.The seven-point agreement between the Congress and the UML in July stated that the KP Sharma Oli-led government would give priority to making amendments to the constitution and formulating laws that ensure political stability by evaluating the strengths, weaknesses and the complexities witnessed during the course of its implementation in the past nine years.A constitution should be a living document and flexibility on amendments and upgrades undoubtedly help with its sustainability. The constitution of India is often cited as an example in this regard. Promulgated by the Constituent Assembly of India in November 1949, the Indian constitution has been amended 106 times thus far. Likewise, many other democratic countries have succeeded in protecting their constitutions for long. The United States has been implementing the same one for the past 236 years.But in the past seven and half decades, Nepal has already produced and implemented seven constitutions. As the debate on review and amendment of the current constitution picks up, the statute will complete just a decade in September 2025. So there are a few vital things Nepali politicians and constitutional experts need to keep in mind. It is vital to address the concerns and grievances of various political, social and other actors. But as important is to ensure that while addressing the demands of all and sundry, the foundations of the charter are not undermined. Another major point the Congress-UML alliance vowed in the seven-point deal is to deliver political stability. Without constitutional stability, political forces can’t give political and policy stability. Though it’s not easy to garner the two-thirds majority required for constitutional amendment, the opposition parties have not ruled out their support for such a process. But they do appear wary of the prospect of the ruling alliance trying to bulldoze the process. If the ruling parties indeed try to forcibly push through such changes—for instance with the intent of obliterating small political parties—it would be a disaster. It will then make Nepali polity less rather than more stable. The country has been facing various challenges in implementing the statute due to the failure to accommodate various political forces right at the start, when the charter was being finalised in 2015. The new initiative shouldn’t end up opening old wounds. For that, all political forces and stakeholders should be taken on board at every step of the new process. That is the only way to ensure the charter’s sustainability and to make it work as well. Once the process starts and a body is entrusted with reviewing the statute, the demands raised by various groups and agendas put forth by different factions within the major parties will gradually take shape and the debate will enter a formal stage. Done prudently from the start, it can help make the national charter a potent document that can guide the country for a long-long time. Get it wrong, and the country could have to pay for it for perhaps even longer.  \nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy accused Slovakia’s Prime Minister Robert Fico on Saturday of opening a “second energy front” against Ukraine on the orders of Russia, as a gas transit dispute between the countries deepened.Ukraine pumps Russian natural gas through its territory to several European countries including Slovakia, but it is expected to halt the flow when the existing transit deal - signed before Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine - expires at the end of the year.Fico, who visited Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow earlier this week, said on Friday Slovakia would consider reciprocal measures against Ukraine such as halting back-up electricity supplies if Kyiv stops the gas transit from January 1.“It appears that Putin gave Fico the order to open the second energy front against Ukraine at the expense of the Slovak people’s interests,” Zelenskiy wrote on the X social media platform.Slovakia wants to maintain Russian gas supplies via Ukraine, saying alternative routes would hike costs and hit its own transit operations, causing it to lose 500 million euros in fees.Ukraine has said it will not sign any new deal for gas transit with Moscow due to the invasion launched by Russia in February 2022.Ukraine has been forced to import electricity from several of its neighbours since Russia began targeting its power grid in late 2022, damaging or destroying much of the country’s non-nuclear generation capacity.The seized oil tanker accused of sabotaging an undersea power cable and four internet cables now sits off Finland’s coast.Zelenskiy said Slovakia currently accounted for 19 percent of Ukraine’s power imports, and that Ukraine was working with its European Union neighbours to bolster the supply.“Slovakia is part of the single European energy market and Fico must respect common European rules,” he wrote, adding that cutting power supplies to Ukraine would deprive Slovakia of $200 million a year.Ukraine’s Foreign Ministry said in a statement that Fico was siding with Putin by making “senseless threats” to cut off Ukraine’s power imports.Since taking office in 2023, Fico has been one of the EU’s most outspoken opponents of military aid to Ukraine.After his talks in Moscow, Fico said Putin had confirmed Russia’s willingness to continue to supply gas to Slovakia, although this was “practically impossible” once the transit deal expires. \nAfghan Taliban forces targeted “several points” in neighbouring Pakistan, Afghanistan’s defence ministry said on Saturday, days after Pakistani aircraft carried out aerial bombardment inside Afghanistan.The statement from the Defence Ministry did not specify Pakistan but said the strikes were conducted “beyond the ‘hypothetical line’” - an expression used by Afghan authorities to refer to a border with Pakistan that they have long disputed.“Several points beyond the hypothetical line, serving as centres and hideouts for malicious elements and their supporters who organised and coordinated attacks in Afghanistan, were targeted in retaliation from the southeastern direction of the country,” the ministry said.Asked whether the statement referred to Pakistan, ministry spokesman Enayatullah Khowarazmi said: “We do not consider it to be the territory of Pakistan, therefore, we cannot confirm the territory, but it was on the other side of the hypothetical line.”Afghanistan has for decades rejected the border, known as the Durand Line, drawn by British colonial authorities in the 19th century through the mountainous and often lawless tribal belt between what is now Afghanistan and Pakistan.No details of casualties or specific areas targeted were provided. The Pakistani military's public relations wing and a spokesperson for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs did not immediately respond to requests for comment.South Korea’s parliament impeached acting president Han Duck-soo on Friday, less than two weeks after ousting President Yoon Suk Yeol.00:02Afghan authorities warned on Wednesday they would retaliate after the Pakistani bombardment, which they said had killed civilians. Islamabad said it had targeted hideouts of Islamist militants along the border.The neighbours have a strained relationship, with Pakistan saying that several militant attacks that have occurred in its country have been launched from Afghan soil - a charge the Afghan Taliban denies. \nThe body of Manmohan Singh, the former Indian prime minister whose death has sparked outpourings of grief at home and accolades from abroad, was cremated on Sunday on the banks of the Yamuna River in New Delhi with full state honours.The funeral was conducted in the Sikh tradition as priests chanted hymns, after Singh’s body, draped in the Indian flag, was carried through the capital on a flower-decked carriage pulled by a ceremonial army truck.The flag was removed and the body covered with a saffron cloth before it was placed on the pyre.Since Singh died on Thursday at 92, many have taken up his comment near the end of his 10-year rule that “history will be kinder to me than the contemporary media.”He was referring to a perception of weak leadership as he headed a coalition government facing numerous charges of corruption, which was thrown out of office in the 2014 election won by his successor Narendra Modi.Modi, who called Singh one of the nation’s “most distinguished leaders” after his death, attended the funeral, along with President Droupadi Murmu and representatives of various countries. Modi’s government has decided to allocate land for Singh's memorial.Singh, considered the architect of India’s economic liberalisation, had criticised Modi’s economic policies such as demonetisation and introducing a goods and services tax.Singh is survived by his wife and three daughters.Congress Leader Rahul Gandhi accompanied Singh’s family on the truck to the Nigambodh Ghat cremation site after the procession from party headquarters in New Delhi, where people joined Congress party leaders and members to pay their last respects.The leaders of the US, Canada, France, Sri Lanka, China and Pakistan were among those expressing grief at Singh’s death and highlighting his international contributions. \nPrakash Osti, a former justice of the Supreme Court, passed away on Friday night following a cardiac arrest. He was admitted to the Thapathali-based Norvic Hospital for treatment but was pronounced dead the same night, according to Supreme Court spokesperson Achyut Kuikel.Osti, aged 71, had a long career as a government attorney and served in the Commission for the Investigation of Abuse of Authority before being appointed as a Supreme Court justice on September 7, 2008. He retired on April 12, 2014 as a temporary justice after his tenure was not extended.During his time at the anti-graft commission, Osti prosecuted several high-profile corruption cases, earning a huge reputation in the society. In 2007, he played an important role as a member of the committee–formed to study anomalies in the court–advocating for a corruption-free judiciary, pointing out middlemen’s pervasive influence within and outside the courts.After retiring from the Supreme Court, Osti served as a National Human Rights Commission member for six years. He remained active in legal research, advocacy, and writing until his demise.The cremation has been scheduled for Sunday at Pashupati Aryaghat, awaiting the arrival of his son from the United States, Kuikel confirmed. \nMexican security forces have detained about 475,000 irregular migrants since October, authorities said on Friday, as US President-elect Donald Trump threatens Mexico with tariffs unless it stops illegal migrants from arriving at the shared border.Nearly half a million migrants being detained between Oct. 1 and Dec. 26 suggests measures intensified towards the end of the year.Since the start of the year, some 900,000 migrants have been detained, the government said earlier this month.“We think it’s a model that works, that can always be improved, but that has responded very satisfactorily to this (migration) phenomenon,” Foreign Minister Juan Ramon de la Fuente said on Friday.Speaking alongside President Claudia Sheinbaum at her regular press conference, he said the number of migrants detained at the shared border fell 81% in mid-December when compared to a year earlier.Israel Ibarra, a researcher on immigration issues at the Colegio de la Frontera Norte, said the increase in detentions was in part due to “the commitment to reduce the transit of people in mobility through Mexico and to the United States” made by Sheinbaum in a recent call with Trump.The call between Sheinbaum and Trump took place in late November after the Republican threatened to impose a 25% tariff on imports from Mexico and Canada if those countries do not stop the arrival of drugs, mostly fentanyl, and migrants. \nThe Meteorological Forecasting Division has reported a partial impact of westerly winds and a western low-pressure system over Nepal.Currently, the weather is partly to generally cloudy in Sudurpaschim, Karnali, and Lumbini provinces, while the rest of the country is experiencing partly cloudy to mainly clear skies. Kathmandu Valley is under partial cloud cover.During the day, light to moderate rainfall is likely in many areas of Sudurpaschim and Karnali provinces, as well as some hilly parts of Koshi Province. Other regions may see light rainfall in isolated areas. Higher elevations in the hilly and Himalayan regions could experience light to moderate snowfall.Tonight, Sudurpaschim and Karnali provinces are expected to remain generally cloudy, while the rest of the country will see partly to generally cloudy skies. Rainfall is forecast in several areas of Sudurpaschim, some parts of Karnali and Koshi provinces, and isolated areas in other regions.Snowfall is likely in higher elevations of Sudurpaschim, Karnali, and Koshi provinces, along with a few places in Gandaki and Bagmati provinces. \nLeaders of five trade unions have warned lawmakers not to ban trade unions in civil service at a time when the State Affairs Committee of the House of Representatives has stood in favour of dissolving party-affiliated trade unions in civil service and allowing civil servants to organise only under an official trade union.The proposal to ban politically-motivated trade unions in the civil service and to allow government workers to unite only under an umbrella trade union was welcomed by several sections including retired senior bureaucrats.After a long hiatus, the bill to regulate the formation, operation, and conditions of federal civil service at the State Affairs and Good Governance Committee is under consideration. The restoration of multi-party democracy in Nepal in 1990 opened the space for civil society organisations, including trade unions. The registration of trade unions started in 1993.Chairpersons of the five different trade unions on Friday issued a statement and warned lawmakers not to act arrogantly against their globally recognised right to open a trade union. They reminded the lawmakers of their contributions to various political changes in Nepal.Trade union leaders have been urging lawmakers not to ban their organisations within the civil service. The draft of the Federal Civil Service Act, sent by the Ministry of Federal Affairs and General Administration for discussion to the State Affairs and Good Governance Committee of the Parliament, also proposes one official trade union for government employees at the federal and provincial levels. During the ongoing discussion in the House committee, almost all members stood in favour of banning trade unions of government employees.Members of the State Affairs Committee are passing negative comments to the media on the Federal Civil Service Act Bill currently being deliberated in the House committee, the joint statement issued by five trade unions said.\"This is creating an environment where unnecessary delays are being created on the pretext of controversy, which will prompt the Federal Civil Service Act not to be issued immediately,” said the trade union leaders.“A serious attention of national-level trade unions has been drawn. We once again remind the government to issue the Federal Civil Service Act immediately.”Reiterating the role they played in decisive movements for regime change in the past, the unions stressed: \"We, the trade unions, remind political parties and the government not to forget the contributions we made during the first people's movement of 2046 BS and the second people's movement of 2062-63 BS by participating in decisive movements for regime change.\"On Thursday, in a meeting of the State Affairs and Good Governance Committee, Nepali Congress Chief Whip Shyam Ghimire and UML Chief Whip Mahesh Bartaula said that party-affiliated trade unions should not be allowed during discussion over the proposed Civil service bill.The organisations have also forwarded some demands to the government related to the guarantee of trade union rights.At the House committee, almost all lawmakers voiced against the trade unions affiliated to political parties saying that they work like political cadres while drawing salary from the state coffers.The chief whips and whips of the political parties were of the opinion that only non-gazetted employees should be allowed to join a trade union. Experts on bureaucracy have also suggested that there should be no room for party-aligned trade unions in the upcoming Federal Civil Service Act.In the past few days, various media outlets have been making statements that discourage, incite, and humiliate civil servants, the joint statement said. “We would also like to warn against such arrogance. The trade unions have demanded that at least section officers/eighth level [gazetted] officers should be allowed to join a registered trade union affiliated to various political parties. They also demanded the establishment of trade unions down to the local level, not only at the federal and provincial levels.”In the Federal Civil Service Act, the unions have demanded the abolition of the hierarchical system and introduction of a tiered system, and a system for career and professional development of civil servants while reviewing their perks. They also want inter-provincial transfer of local and provincial employees. \nNepal Airlines' request for proposal for two Airbus A330s was allegedly rigged in favor of AAR Corp, with bribes paid through intermediaries, resulting in the indictment of a former Nepal Airlines official and fines for AAR, who profited by almost $24 million.\n**Concise Summary:**\nKey events unfolded, including battles, treaties, advancements, and societal changes, shaping the course of history.\nHelicopter sightseeing tours over Everest Region banned from January 1st due to noise pollution and security concerns, sparking controversies between local authorities, state bodies, and tourism industry.\nSamara endured six months of harassment from a relative of her late husband before a court interim order demanded her harasser leave her alone. In this period of inaction from the court, Samara (who the Post is identifying with a pseudonym for privacy) fell into depression and attempted suicide, feeling trapped and hopeless. “There is late justice, and these victims are still being victimised,” Samara’s legal counsel told the Post. “Justice delayed is justice denied.” Women in Nepal seeking justice for domestic violence or property partition wait years—often more than five and sometimes upwards of ten years—for the court to resolve their cases and fully implement the decision. The delays in case processing come at a cost to the women, who endure more harassment, financial strain, and loss of contact with their children as they wait for the justice system to take action. In the past year, the court has established a family bench in six of the 77 district courts in Nepal to hear women’s cases more quickly. The bench aims to give female plaintiffs faster decisions in cases related to family relations, alimony, domestic violence, and property division. The family bench, however, does not see a woman’s case when it also includes a legal matter outside of the purview of the bench, nor does the court see divorce cases as Nepali law mandates a one-year waiting period for divorce cases when one of the parties does not agree to the divorce. Since its filing, the main trial court has heard Samara’s case as it is tied to a property division case in which her late husband’s relative is the plaintiff. Samara’s interim order from the court has brought her some peace. Since the order two years ago, her harasser has stopped coming to her workplace demanding the property holdings of her late husband. “After she got the interim order, she believed in herself more,” Samara’s legal counsel said. “Before, she didn’t believe in court, she thought she would not get justice.” Samara’s legal counsel anticipates that the case will take at least another two and a half years at the district court, and may continue longer at the Supreme Court level if one of the parties chooses to appeal the decision. “She doesn’t feel protected,” the legal counsel said. Even when a woman’s case goes to the family bench, procedural hurdles can still delay the verdict, particularly when the case involves property division. Edha’s (who the Post is also identifying with a pseudonym for privacy) domestic violence and property division case is in its fourth year at the Kathmandu District Court. One of her hearings was with one of the three judges appointed to preside over the family bench. She had an arranged marriage more than 20 years ago, and soon after she gave birth to her first child. “After I got married, the abuse was non-stop,” she said. “It was quite brutal.”During her marriage, her husband, who continuously had relationships with other women, left her with serious injuries in bouts of violence, and pressured her to abort multiple pregnancies, though she did later have a second child as the pregnancy was too advanced to abort. Edha didn’t tell anyone about the abuse for most of her marriage. “If you’re going through something bad, if nobody comes to know, then it’s okay,” she said. “My fear was, if people find out, what will they think?”This fear of judgment stopped Edha from taking legal action for years. “In Nepal, if your husband hits you, that means it’s your fault,” she said. “With that kind of stigma, at times, I would just blame myself.” During the pandemic, Edha’s husband told her he wanted a divorce, and became more physically abusive. She decided to leave the house and move to a different home, though she felt hesitant about having to leave her children. “When he told me to get out of the house, and when he started hitting me, I thought I cannot survive in the house,” she said. “It was really difficult for me to leave. I feared I wouldn’t be able to take care of my children.”Edha hopes she will soon have her final hearing, which has been delayed because the court required further documentation. Edha fears seeing her abuser again at the hearing. “That fear is still within me,” she said. “I don’t want to look at that man.”After years of living alone, Edha feels most devastated by the loss of time with her children. She hopes her case will result in her being able to stay where she currently lives and have parental visitation rights. “They told me, within three months, this will be over,” she said between tears. “But it’s the fourth year running, and my kids are far away. I have missed the moments with them.” Edha feels stuck, with no other option than waiting for justice. “I don’t have any faith in the justice system of Nepal—no faith at all,” she said. According to domestic violence victims and their lawyers, when a male defendant has connections to judges or enough money to offer bribes, getting justice can be near impossible. Manika Khadka is a criminal lawyer working with the Women’s Foundation Nepal, and has seen dozens of women’s cases. “In some cases, he [the defendant] is so powerful and they use unnecessary power—that’s why we cannot get justice.”Neesa (also a pseudonym) filed a property division case against her husband nearly a decade ago and shortly after a domestic violence case. Male members of her family had for years violently abused her. Her cases have faced continuous delays, she claims, because of her husband’s bribes and connections to court officials. “You can go and register your case in the court, but then if corruption is involved… court procedures can be manipulated to cause delays,” she said. The Supreme Court has already issued a verdict in Neesa’s favor on the domestic violence case, ordering the defendant to pay both interim relief and a fine. The court, however, has failed to implement the decision.According to Neesa, because of bribes from her husband, officials in the implementation division of the district court have intentionally not enforced the Supreme Court’s verdict to make the defendant pay interim relief to the victim. Instead, the implementation division gave an order that would allow the defendant to avoid payment—a direct violation of the Supreme Court’s ruling. Neesa has no choice but to go back through the court system again, asking for the Supreme Court’s decision to be enforced. Her property case is still ongoing, and each step of the process takes months, she said. “There is a delay at every step of the process,” Neesa said. “The court officials don’t do their jobs efficiently.” Neesa feels frustrated with how long her cases have taken, and the amount of time, money and energy they have required from her. “It is a nightmare,” she said. “These delays and obstacles are attempts to make the plaintiff give up—women rarely have the resources to fight these cases for years and years.” “I can’t plan my life, I’m stuck,” she said. “It’s years of my life I won’t get back.” Samara, Edha, and Neesa each are equipped with legal counsel and have current cases pending, but, as Neesa reflected, innumerable women endure abuse in silence, particularly after they see other women endure long delays in the court cases. “I am educated and can stand up for myself and this is how I am treated, imagine the women who are uneducated,” Neesa said. “If [the court procedure] was simple and it was fair a lot more women would go through it and get justice,” she said.   \n**Summarize the major events in 1 line without losing crucial information.**\nCrucial events unfold as individuals confront challenges, make choices, and experience transformative outcomes.\n\nRae was the envoy to Kathmandu during the promulgation of the 2015 constitution and the subsequent blockade. In this conversation, Rae talks about the evolution of Nepal-India ties since the blockade, regional geopolitics, what the two countries get wrong about each other, how New Delhi views Nepali communist parties and the governments they lead, and the change (if any) in India’s neighbourhood policy since the start of Narendra Modi’s third term in office. \nAh, Saturday mornings—basking in the warm embrace of the winter sun, savouring the sweetness of oranges, and rejoicing in the peace the weekend offers. Yet, as much as I enjoy these peaceful moments, Saturday makes me restless. The question of how to spend the day clouds my sense of calm.While scrolling through Instagram, I stumbled upon a post from Mandala Theatre. Their latest play, ‘Hari Hajurba’, was showing. In that instant, my dilemma vanished. I knew exactly how to spend my day. Actor Najir Husen wrote, conceptualised, and directed the play, starring alongside actor Bijay Baral. Before the play starts, the faintest glow of light reveals the silhouette of a house with a tree standing behind it. As the lights get a little brighter, heralding the start of the play, the audience notices a radio outside the house, a sweater hung on the outer side wall and, most importantly, the solitary tree bearing just a single leaf.The tree caught my attention, reminding me of O Henry's short story ‘The Last Leaf’. The play, like ‘The Last Leaf’, is crafted to evoke emotions and touch the heart.Then, Hajurba (Bijay Baral) emerges from the audience and repeatedly asks, ‘Kopila lai chinchau?’ (Do you know Kopila?). He walks to the stage, sits in front of his house and listens to the radio. Radio Nepal broadcasts news of those who have returned home after the peace agreement. The presenter announces their names. This makes the audience aware that the play is set in 2006. While the presenter announces the names, Hajurba listens carefully. Then, to his dismay, the radio ceases to play. He cannot hear the name he has longed to hear—Kopila, his dear granddaughter. Kopila was taken from her Hajurba during the time of People’s Movement Two. One day, armed individuals from the jungle unexpectedly arrived at their house. They demanded that Hajurba let them take Kopila to join the revolution. They tried to cajole and coerce him into agreeing. Hajurba was adamantly opposed to sending her away. Despite both Hajurba and Kopila refusing, the armed men stubbornly took her away, leaving Hajurba heartbroken. This reminded me of the stories of People’s Movement Two that my grandparents used to tell me. They told me that the Maoists used to come to people’s homes and blackmail them. They forcefully took away sons and daughters from many families. Their actions instilled fear among the villagers. To escape the Maoists, many people migrated elsewhere, leaving the village nearly deserted. Watching this play felt like watching the story my grandparents used to tell me. Hajurba is a man broken by life’s tragedies. After losing his wife at a young age, his granddaughter Kopila is the sole reason for his existence, the light in his otherwise dark world. Ever since she left, he has clung to the hope of her return, which grows stronger daily. Time drifts by, but his longing only strengthens, rooted in his love for Kopila.Just like the single leaf on the barren tree outside his home, Hajurba is alone. His solitude extends beyond his house; it engulfs the entire village, abandoned by its inhabitants who migrated to other places. Hajurba, however, refuses to leave. The possibility of Kopila’s return keeps him tethered to this desolate place. The lone leaf on the tree becomes a symbol of his life—fragile yet resilient, holding on despite everything.The depth of Hajurba’s character is something spectators cannot help but notice and feel. His every action, expression, and movement reflects his quiet sorrow and enduring love. Tasks like drying radio batteries under the sunlight to hear Kopila’s name on the radio speak volumes about his innocence and hope. His crumpled and torn daura suruwal, paired with his house in disrepair, reveals his indifference toward his well-being.Even on cold winter nights, Hajurba sleeps outside, ignoring his health. Nothing else matters to him—not his comfort, not his health, not even his life. His granddaughter’s longing becomes his primary focus. Every aspect of Hajurba’s existence revolves around love, hope and the pain of his longing for her.Eventually, Hari (Najir Husen), a postman, meets Hajurba while delivering letters. The old man’s welcoming nature draws Hari into his home and, gradually, into his life. Over time, Hajurba shares his sorrow and longing for his granddaughter with Hari. Unable to see Hajurba in such a sorrowful state, Hari comforts him with a lie. He reads a letter to Hajurba, claiming it is from Kopila—though it was neither written nor sent. In the letter, Hari assures Hajurba that Kopila is doing well and will return soon. Hearing this fills Hajurba with sheer joy, and his worries seem to vanish.This scene was heartbreaking to watch. It portrays the fragility of hope. Hajurba’s longing for his granddaughter, the only family he has left, is so intense that he clings to even the faintest sign of her existence.The audience knows the letter isn’t real, and while Hajurba feels momentary joy, the truth lingers in the background. This makes his fleeting joy more painful to witness.This play seamlessly integrates musical performances, Kathak, and poetry elements into its storytelling, enriching the narrative. While the play is deeply poignant, it also includes moments of laughter. Remarkably, the humour never overshadows the emotional depth of the story. The play beautifully captures the essence of human longing, hope, and pain.Ultimately, ‘Hari Hajurba’ leaves an indelible mark on its audience. It intertwines a personal narrative with the larger socio-political fabric of Nepal’s past. Above all, this play encourages the audience to appreciate Nepal's socio-political situation. While far from perfect, it reminds us to value the peace we enjoy and to recognise even the minimal contributions made by our elected leaders.‘Hari Hajurba’Director: Najir HusenCast: Najir Husen, Bijay Baral, Sabina Thapa, Rohit ShahDuration: 1 hour 10 minutesVenue: Mandala Theatre, Thapagaun, New BaneshwarShowtimes: Every day at 5:15 pm except Monday and an extra 1:00 pm show on Saturday until January 12 \nRishi Handa is an educator and researcher specialising in South Asian and Punjab studies with a PhD from SOAS University of London. He currently heads the Sanskrit and Religious Studies departments at St James Senior Boys’ School, England, also teaching Mathematics and Ancient Greek.In addition to his academic work, Handa is a musician who co-founded the band ‘Flute That Groove’ and performed with artists like Anup Jalota, an Indian singer known for his contributions to the Bhajan genre of Indian music. He is fluent in several languages, including Urdu, Hindi, Punjabi, English, and Sanskrit, combining his skills in education, music, and cultural exchange.In this chat with the Post’s Aarya Chand, Handa discusses his career, blending education, cultural studies, and music while reflecting on his academic and creative experiences.As the Head of Sanskrit at a British school, how do you approach teaching this ancient language to students who might not have a cultural or historical connection to it?I use an unconventional approach, focusing on neuroscience and psychology, to make Sanskrit learning enjoyable. I introduce letters through puzzles and crosswords. To make vocabulary engaging, I incorporate hip-hop beats. I teach grammar tables vertically to help students see patterns, making it easy for them to understand the logic rather than just memorising it.The challenges include helping neurodiverse students who may struggle with memorisation or pronunciation. I guide them step-by-step through sound mechanics for pronunciation.Teaching Sanskrit alongside Latin and Ancient Greek, highlighting their structural similarities, creates opportunities for cognitive development. It trains the brain to think in a systematic and logical process.You have a rich academic background spanning both philosophy and mathematics. How do you think these two fields complement each other?Philosophy and mathematics complement each other in promoting critical thinking by focusing on logic and reasoning. Philosophy encourages students to explore the ‘why’, question assumptions, and analyse arguments, while mathematics emphasises the ‘how’ through structured problem-solving. As a teacher of both, I use my background in mathematics to clarify reasoning in philosophy and connect abstract mathematical concepts to more general guidelines. Together, these fields develop creative and logical thinking, giving students a strong foundation for critical thinking and intellectual growth.Your band, ‘Flute That Groove’, blends Indian classical instruments with contemporary sounds. How do you see music contributing to cultural preservation and bridging cultural divides, particularly in a globalised world?Music contributes to cultural preservation and bridges cultural divides. People interested in world music may be drawn to a particular genre, like Western folk fans who appreciate Indian classical music. While Indian classical music has a bit of an acquired taste and is not for everyone, fusion music, like what we do, blends Indian and Western instruments. This allows us to play Indian songs in a Western-style or put an Indian twist on English songs.Music unites people by blending different cultural elements, creating something that resonates with a broader range of listeners.How do you view the role of multilingualism in enhancing cultural understanding and academic research?Understanding each other’s languages is the gateway to understanding a culture. Language defines a culture, and without it, the culture is lost. Every language has a unique way of expressing ideas, and there is no perfect one-to-one translation between them. For example, in English, we prefer the active voice, such as ‘the man eats the apple,’ but Sanskrit typically favours the passive, like ‘the apple is eaten by the man.’This reflects a different way of thinking. In Sanskrit, the focus is more on the object than the subject. This aligns with philosophies like Vedanta, where one sees oneself as the instrument rather than the doer.Moreover, certain words don't have direct translations. Words like ‘Vishwas’, ‘Nishtha’, and ‘Shraddha’ are often translated as ‘faith’, but each carries its unique connotation in the Indian context. Understanding such nuances is essential.One’s understanding is limited and filtered without knowing a culture's language. I’ve seen how knowing the original language, like Greek for the Bible, can change everything. During a debate, I remember someone using Greek insights to shift the whole perspective, showing how language deepens cultural understanding.What was your most memorable experience in Nepal? Did you find similarities between the cultural or religious practices and your studies of South Asian traditions?My experience in Nepal has been insightful. One of my most memorable moments was discovering the connection between the practices here and my research on the Udasi tradition, which is rooted in Guru Nanak’s teachings. Before arriving in Nepal, I felt unsure because I had no prior knowledge or frame of reference for the country. Unlike India, which was somewhat familiar to me, Nepal was entirely unfamiliar. However, people assured me of the country’s warm and friendly nature, and their words turned out to be true. The culture here feels grounded, and the people are calm, which I find refreshing. I’ve also been struck by the lack of anger or aggression. Even when navigating through crowds, there’s a sense of calmness. Something special happened when I visited a local area in Kathmandu and stumbled upon a Udasi Ashram, which was a perfect, unexpected connection to my academic research. The discovery felt like a stroke of serendipity. As I wandered down an unassuming alley, I heard verses from the Guru Granth Sahib streaming through a window. I hadn't expected to encounter such a place during my visit to Nepal, which made it all the more meaningful given my studies of South Asian and Punjabi traditions.With a diverse professional background that includes teaching, music, and filmmaking, what inspires you to keep exploring new avenues? Are there any upcoming projects or ideas you are particularly excited about?I’ve always been passionate about exploring new ideas, and my background in teaching, music, and filmmaking reflects my curiosity and willingness to blend disciplines. Learning and growing continue to drive me, as each experience adds a layer to my understanding of the world. As for upcoming projects, I am excited to develop an app that teaches Indian languages, including Sanskrit, in an easy and accessible way. I aim to help preserve and promote these languages, particularly among the Western diaspora, where many people have become disconnected from their language roots.My method is based on neuroscience and psychology, which makes language learning more intuitive and effortless. I dream of making learning languages like Sanskrit, Hindi, Tamil, and Punjabi accessible to all ages. The app will be designed in such a way that after just a few hours, someone will be able to start reading newspapers in these languages. I’m also considering including spoken Sanskrit courses, as there is significant interest from those who wish to reconnect with their roots but find traditional methods too tricky. Creating this accessible learning space excites me, and I look forward to seeing how it evolves.Rishi Handa’s book recommendationsI Am ThatAuthor: Nisargadatta MaharajPublisher: Chetana PublishingYear: 1973In this book, an illiterate cigarette seller from Mumbai offers conversations on spirituality, self-realisation, and the nature of existence.Guru Granth SahibAuthor: Compiled by Guru Arjan Dev (and others)Publisher: Sikh religious authoritiesYear: 1604This is a sacred scripture of the Sikh faith.

According to Ghimire, Congress believes that political party’s unions should not be allowed to function in the bureaucracy.He was speaking on the bill to regulate the formation, operation, and conditions of federal civil service at the State Affairs and Good Governance Committee meeting on Thursday.Ghimire said those on the government payroll should not participate in trade union's activities.“In civil service, trade unions shouldn't be formed based on their party allegiance,” Ghimire said. “If a trade union is needed, there could be an official one where every civil servant can be a member.”The restoration of multi-party democracy in Nepal in 1990 opened the space for civil society organisations, including trade unions. The registration of trade unions started in 1993.Devraj Dahal, a researcher who has extensively studied the necessity of establishing trade unions in Nepal, says that at that time, labourers around Nepal were getting the short end of the stick, which is one reason why trade unions were established in Nepal. Trade unions, or labour unions, are formed to advocate the rights of labourers and improve their working conditions.“Trade unions are needed to create a just society, but in Nepal, those unions have been working as proxy agencies of political parties, to advance their vested interests,” Dahal said. “Hence, their relevance can be questioned.”Dahal added that trade unions are concentrated in Kathmandu and they have failed to work in the interest of labourers outside cities who might be in most need of their advocacy.Congress lawmaker Ghimire told the Post that when every party has its trade union in the civil service or any other institutional organisations, they may support respective party’s sister wings but will not benefit the larger society.“It is high time that the country dissolved trade unions affiliated to political parties and marched ahead for the development of the country,” Ghimire said.Rastriya Prajatantra Party (RPP) whip Bina Lama shared a more radical view at the same meeting. She said that trade unions should be completely abolished in the civil service to help bureaucracy function effectively.“Trade unions have become parties’ recruitment centres in the bureaucracy,” Lama said. “To prevent it from being expanded further, the law should prevent civil servants from joining political parties or their sister organisations.”However, Dahal differed. “Nepal is a signatory to many international treaties, which oblige us to do so. Therefore, the country cannot fully eradicate trade unions,” he said. Instead of making it a recruitment centre for political parties, as the Congress chief whip Ghimire said, Dahal advocates an umbrella trade union where all can be adjusted.“In most Western countries, including Germany, there is one official trade union that works efficiently,” Dahal added.The draft of the Federal Civil Service Act, sent by the Ministry of Federal Affairs and General Administration for discussion in the State Affairs and Good Governance Committee of the Parliament, also proposes approval of one official trade union for government employees at the federal and provincial levels.While speaking on the bill in the same meeting, Mahesh Bartaula, the chief whip of ruling party CPN-UML, stood in favour of fixing the term of reservation quota for a single person in the civil service. It means a single person should be allowed to get a government position under reservation quota for a single opportunity and then the person should compete under open category for other positions.“How long will we give the facility of reservation repeatedly for a single person? It is wrong to provide reservation to the same person in every post within the service,” Bartaula further said. “Reservation should be allowed for a person only once and it should be on the basis of class.”Bartaula also advocated for the two year cooling period for government officials while joining national and international organisations after their retirement. \nIn a secretariat meeting of the ruling CPN-UML held on Wednesday, Prime Minister and party chairman KP Sharma Oli briefed secretariat members on the political situation after the formation of the coalition with the Nepali Congress, the government's effectiveness and weaknesses, and his China visit in the first week of December, among other issues.Immediately after Oli's briefing, the secretariat members also expressed their views on the latest situation, said a UML secretariat member. The secretariat meeting also discussed the agenda of the central committee meeting which would be held on January 5 and 6.The secretariat meeting stressed the need for giving momentum to the government by expediting service delivery. The meeting also suggested reforms to make the government's functioning more effective, according to the secretariat member.An eight-member task force formed by the Congress and the UML on November 6 to strengthen ties between two parties decided to form a six-member committee to work on the issue.The Congress has appointed Semanta Dahal, Arun Paudel, and Pratap Paudel as members to suggest on service delivery. In contrast, former chief secretary of the government Lila Gadtaula and senior advocates Kedar Koirala and Rajendra Ghimire were appointed by the UML. “The prime minister's office will be our secretariat, and we are assigned to start our work from Thursday,” a service delivery task force member said. “The main job of the task force is to give policy advice to minimise hassle related to service delivery.” The task force formed to strengthen the two-party relations has Vice-president Purna Bahadur Khadka, General Secretary Gagan Thapa, Home Minister Ramesh Lekhak, and Foreign Minister Arzu Rana Deuba from the Congress. UML senior vice-chair Ishwor Pokharel, vice-chair and Finance Minister Bishnu Paudel, General Secretary Shankar Pokharel, and political adviser to the prime minister and Deputy General Secretary Bishnu Rimal are the party’s members.Congress vice-chair Khadka said that during the task force meeting, they discussed ways to address the issue of amending the constitution and other pertinent matters. “The two parties have formally entered the agenda of amending the constitution and are considering forming a mechanism for the same shortly,” Khadka said. Amending the constitution was a key promise of the seven-point agreement signed between Nepal’s two largest political parties, the Congress and the UML, in early July while forming the government led by Oli. The two parties' meeting on Tuesday, which lasted almost three hours, also discussed potential candidates to lead the constitutional amendment process. Likewise, the two ruling parties have formed a separate task force to speed up the passage of bills through Parliament.Every party has parliamentary leaders, chief whip and whip in Parliament who look after issues related to the bill, Khadka said. “Besides, we also have various committees in Parliament for the same.” \nThe National Assembly chair, deputy chair, lawmakers and other officials from the federal parliament came together at an event in Kathmandu on Tuesday to discuss the current state of implementation of federalism in the country and ways to strengthen the federal system, which has been practiced in Nepal since 2017.National Assembly Chairman Narayan Prasad Dahal said that there were some mistakes in the course of practicing the newly adopted system. “Many have expected better delivery, economic prosperity and social justice, among other things, in the federal system,” Dahal said while addressing the interaction titled ‘Federalism, National Assembly and the tasks ahead’ jointly organised by the National Assembly and Federalism and Localisation Centre in Kathmandu on Tuesday. “Honestly speaking, there have been some shortcomings.”Bimala Ghimire, vice-chair of the Assembly, said that the upper house should play more role in strengthening the provincial and local levels.Former lawmaker Khim Lal Devkota, who is also chairman of the Centre, showcased a presentation on the issues raised in the seven provincial assemblies. Assembly Secretary Surendra Aryal explained the practices implemented by the Assembly and plans ahead.Parliamentary party leaders Narayankaji Shrestha of the CPN (Maoist Centre), Beduram Bhusal of CPN (Unified Socialist), and general secretary of the parliament secretariat Padam Prasad Pandey, among other officials, also spoke about strengthening the federal system.Lawmakers representing various provinces and dozens of other lawmakers and experts working in the field brainstormed about ways to strengthen the federal system, particularly the provinces. \nFive months after forming the government led by KP Sharma Oli, coalition partners Nepali Congress and CPN-UML are in the final stages of forming mechanisms to identify the areas for amending the constitution.A major agreement between the Congress and the UML while forming the government in mid-July was to amend the constitution and review provisions that have created difficulties in its implementation.On Tuesday, the constitution amendment process finally entered bilateral talks between the Congress and the UML. An eight-member task force formed to strengthen the relations between the two parties met on Tuesday and discussed initiating the amendment process. “The issue of amendment has finally entered our discussion from today [Tuesday],” a task force member said. “We are currently discussing how to proceed and start wider discussions and consultations. We are considering forming either a political or a non-political taskforce to do the required homework.”The cross-party task force will be led by a senior politician, and comprise members of different political parties. If a non-political task force is formed, it will be led by a former chief justice of the Supreme Court or any other respected legal figure acceptable to all stakeholders. Some Congress and UML leaders have suggested forming a non-political mechanism or taskforce where legal experts, constitutional experts, human rights activists among others can be accommodated and a way ahead can be found as per their suggestions, according to a taskforce member. “We will confront difficult questions if we form a political mechanism,” he said. The meeting lasted three hours and leaders also discussed some ‘neutral’ names who can potentially lead such a mechanism or taskforce. Some political parties in the opposition have already started discussion and deliberations on the issues that need to to be addressed in order to amend the constitution. Point number two of the seven-point agreement signed between the Congress and UML in July stated that the national consensus government under the leadership of Oli would give priority to making necessary amendments to the constitution and formulating laws that ensure political stability by evaluating the strengths and weaknesses as well as the complexities seen in its implementation. “As per the understanding, our party will soon form a mechanism to identify the content for amendment,” said Home Minister Ramesh Lekhak.The Nepali Congress and the UML will soon form separate task forces to identify the contents for amendment in the constitution, Lekhak said at an event in Kathmandu. “The government has also taken an initiative on this.”“The amendment process does not end overnight. It will happen after a series of discussion and deliberations among the parties. We will assess our decade-long experience of constitutional practice and, accordingly, all political parties will sit together and make amendments,” he said.“We will initiate discussions, evaluate and assess the status of the implementation of the constitution, identify the amendment subject matters, and proceed with discussions and deliberations,” said Lekhak.The agreement between the two largest parties to amend the constitution has ignited debate in and outside political circles. Parties are divided on whether this is the right time to make changes in the constitution. But Home Minister Lekhak said the ruling and opposition parties will first review the 10-year journey of the constitution and identify its strengths and weaknesses. Second, the two ruling parties will identify the issues that need to be amended and the ruling and opposition parties will sit together for this. At last, the Congress and UML will reach an agreement on the content for amendment and table it in the house. He also clarified that the amendment to the constitution will strengthen inclusiveness rather than weaken it. The third largest party, the CPN (Maoist Centre), will also soon publicise its position on constitution amendment. The upcoming central committee meeting of the party scheduled to kick off on January 5 will open discussions on the matter, said party spokesperson Agni Prasad Sapkota. “The party has its own position on the amendment but we are open to discussions,” Sapkota said. The party will make its position public only after the meeting of its central committee.“Our position is clear: any amendment to the constitution should be for a progressive cause, not for a regressive cause. It should aim at development and prosperity. Second, there should be a directly elected president for political stability. We must opt for full inclusiveness in both houses of parliament. If we guarantee these issues in the new amendment proposal, the protracted political instability in the country will come to an end,” said Sapkota.Besides the Maoist Centre, other political parties represented in parliament are also doing homework regarding the amendment in the constitution but they are yet to make their position, preparation and homework public.Another party, the CPN (Unified Socialist), on December 17 formed a seven-member task force under party leader Prakash Jwala to work out the party’s position on the constitution amendment process. “We have formed a task force which will come out with some recommendations in this aspect,” said party spokesperson, Jagannath Khatiwada. Congress General Secretary Gagan Thapa, speaking at a party function in Kathmandu on Sunday, also said a mechanism to amend the constitution would be formed within a few days. Thapa added that the mechanism would be pragmatic and amendments would be made cautiously.“The debate on amending the constitution has begun,” Thapa said. “Within a few days, the Congress and the UML will form a mechanism. We will handle this cautiously since there is no room for adventures. We will also have a dialogue with other political parties.”He said the constitution cannot be amended just because the Congress and the UML want it. It will be done only after broad consultations among the Maoist, Madhesi and other political forces.“After reaching an agreement with all parties and stakeholders, we will amend minimum provisions necessary to ensure the constitution’s smooth functioning,” Thapa said. \nForeign Minister Arzu Rana Deuba returned from New Delhi on Monday evening, with no clarity on when Prime Minister KP Oli will make his long anticipated official visit to India. Despite Oli’s eagerness to visit the southern neighbour since taking office in mid-July, efforts to secure an invitation from New Delhi have yet to succeed. At the same time, CPN-UML deputy general secretary and former foreign minister Pradeep Gyawali also returned home from New Delhi on Monday. According to officials, both the incumbent and former foreign ministers failed to make any headway in securing a date for Prime Minister Oli’s India visit.“This time, I went to India to participate in an Indo-Nepal economic summit and for a health check-up,” she said while responding to a question at Kathmandu airport upon her arrival. “I had no political meetings or discussions this time.” Deuba, who left for the Hague, Netherlands on December 7, leading Nepal’s delegation to the International Court of Justice (ICJ), returned home via India where she also underwent a health checkup, according to a statement issued by her private secretariat. On December 9, she had presented Nepal’s position on the ‘Obligations of states in respect of climate change’ during ICJ hearings held from December 2 to 12.The hearings were initiated following the adoption of United Nations General Assembly Resolution A/RES/77/276, which requested the ICJ’s advisory opinion on states’ responsibilities concerning climate change.She then travelled to Berlin, Germany, to attend the Equal Rights Coalition Conference, scheduled on December 17 and 18. The conference was hosted by German Federal Minister for Foreign Affairs Annalena Baerbock on behalf of the Coalition’s co-chairs, Germany and Mexico. During her Europe visit, Minister Deuba held several high-level discussions with officials from Belgium, Luxembourg, Germany, and the European Union.On Monday, before leaving for Kathmandu, she participated in an interaction at India Foundation which is led by Ram Madhav, former general secretary of the Bharatiya Janata Party. Deuba’s Delhi trip came with high expectations, especially after her last visit in August, when she met Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi as well as her counterpart, S. Jaishankar. But this time, the visit was unofficial and she thus could not meet Indian leaders, one official at the foreign ministry said. As she was in Delhi for her regular check up, no formal meetings were planned, according to Deuba’s private secretariat. But according to some Nepali Congress leaders, she tried her best to meet her counterpart, Jaishankar, and other Indian leaders in order to create a positive environment for the prime minister’s India visit, but her attempts were unsuccessful. The prime minister’s office also expected foreign minister Deuba, with her profile and good connections in the Indian establishment, to be able to meet top Indian leaders and lay the ground for the prime minister’s India visit. After the prime minister failed to secure an invitation from India, Oli went on his first bilateral visit to China in December first week and signed a framework for cooperation on the Belt and Road Initiative. According to a Nepali Congress leader closely following the dynamics between Oli and New Delhi, India appears uncomfortable with the deal Oli signed in Beijing, adding uncertainty to his Delhi trip. Also, there is unease in the Congress after the party leadership failed to maintain the party position of not taking loans under the BRI framework.While in Delhi, Rana had addressed an Indo-Nepal economic conference, met some policymakers and discussed the future of Nepal-India relations. Despite getting no invitation from India, Oli, speaking in his hometown in the district of Jhapa, had declared that he would visit India soon. “We have achieved good results from my China visit. Some people don’t believe I am going to India. But I am, and unexpected results will be achieved,” Oli had said. \nBetween Saturday and Monday night, at least three people were murdered in the Kathmandu valley.Milan Acharya took the lives of his father Kul Prasad and younger brother Prabin at Fika Dhara ward 2 of Suryabinayak Municipality, Bhaktapur on Saturday night. After two days, on Monday night, 23-year-old Nayan Gurung was murdered at the Town Cafe in Chyasal, Lalitpur.According to initial police investigation reports, no definite reason for the two murders has been found other than a momentary impulse on the part of the assailant.After a failed suicide bid, Acharya surrendered himself, Nepal Police spokesperson Bishwa Adhikari said. There is a mark from attempted suicide on his body, and police are investigating the matter.The bodies of 56-year-old Kul Prasad and his 22-year-old son Prabin were found in separate rooms of their residence in ward 2 of Suryabinayak Municipality, Fika Dhara.“After breaking into the house on Monday morning, we found the father and younger son dead in separate rooms,” said Deputy Superintendent Dhundiraj Neupane, spokesperson for the Bhaktapur District Police Range. “As per our initial investigation, the murders were committed on Saturday night. However, it came to our notice on Monday morning after one of their neighbours informed us that the doors to the rooms had been locked for the past two days.”The younger son’s body was found on a bed in a makeshift kitchen, while the father’s body was in another room. Both had injuries below their ears. Police recovered a traditional stone grinder and a dumbbell with blood and hair at the scene.The Acharya brothers had been renting a ground-floor room in the three-storey house for three years.The Acharya family is from Diktel Rupakot Majhuwagadhi Municipality in Khotang district. The deceased, Kul Prasad, was the acting head of the Khotang District Post Office while younger son Prabin was pursuing a BSc degree.Nepal Police has also arrested three people on charges of murder of Nayan Gurung and have taken them under investigation.According to District Police Range Lalitpur spokesperson Navratna Paudel Gurung, who had visited the Town Cafe in Chyasal on Monday night, was involved in a fatal brawl with the cafe staff in the course of paying the bill.“Gurung was stabbed to death,” spokesperson Paudel said. Those arrested are Hemraj Bhatta, 26, who works at the restaurant; Janak Bahadur Tamang, 22, of Kavre; and Padmalal Bhatta, 41, of Darchula.Milan Acharya, who had absconded following the Fika Dhara incident, turned himself in at the Maharajgunj Police Circle on Tuesday morning to confess to the murder of his father and brother. According to Bishwa Adhikari, spokesperson for Nepal Police, Acharya has confessed to killing his father and younger brother. Adhikari says that Acharya cited depression as the reason for the murder.“My father had depression, I failed to pass the civil service exams despite multiple attempts, and my younger brother was not good at studying, which had further exacerbated the family’s frustrations,” Adhikari quoted Acharya as saying. “I decided to relieve my family by killing them and later killing myself.” Psychiatrist Dr Basudev Karki, who has been actively involved in establishing the field of Community Psychiatry in Nepal, says that in most such cases the murderers as well as those who commit serious crimes have poor mental health. “The parents, the surrounding environment, the whole society, affects an individual’s upbringing. If they are not brought up right, there is a high chance of them committing various kinds of crimes after they grow up,” said Karki.Of late, there has been a spate of murders. As per initial investigation by Nepal Police, most murder cases result from personal enmity. Talking to the media on December 18, Nepal Police spokesperson Adhikari said: “The increasing cases of murders are due to personal grievances rather than criminal motives.”As per the police data, in the first four months of the fiscal year 2024-25, at least 192 people have been murdered.Anthropologist Dambar Chemjong says that individuals see themselves as alienated from society when they fail to cope with the rapidly changing social, political, economic and technological changes, which leads to depression, suicidal tendencies and criminal activities.“When social beliefs, norms and values are diluted due to rapid changes in society, people can breach the norms of human life on a momentary impulse,” Chemjong added. “I see the same tendency in Acharya’s case.” \nMilan Acharya, who had been absconding following the Balkot incident, turned himself in at the Maharajgunj Police Circle on Tuesday morning.According to police sources, Acharya has confessed to killing his father and younger brother.The bodies of 56-year-old Kul Prasad Acharya and his 22-year-old son Prabin Acharya were discovered on Monday in separate rooms of their residence in ward 2 of Suryabinayak Municipality, Balkot.“We found the father and younger son dead after breaking into the house on Monday morning. Their bodies were in separate rooms,” said Deputy Superintendent of Police Dhundiraj Neupane, spokesperson for Bhaktapur District Police Range. The younger son’s body was found on a bed in a makeshift kitchen, while the father’s body was in another room. Both had injuries below their ears. Police recovered a traditional stone grinder and a dumbbell with blood and hair at the scene. The Acharya brothers had been renting a ground-floor room in the three-storey house for three years. The Acharya family hails from Diktel Rupakot Majhuwagadhi Municipality in Khotang district. The deceased, Kul Prasad Acharya, was acting head of the Khotang District Post Office. Elder son Milan had been preparing for public service exams, while younger son Prabin was pursuing a BSc degree. \nThe Kathmandu Metropolitan City has announced that it will start random on-the-spot emission testing of vehicles on the road beginning next week.The move of the city office comes amid deteriorating air quality in Kathmandu Valley.“We have provided necessary training to two mechanical engineers, who will be deployed for emission testing,” said Jagatman Shrestha, traffic expert adviser at the metropolis. “We have also coordinated with the environment department of the federal government, traffic police, and the department of transport management to start these tests.”The city office has purchased two smoke meters (a portable device for testing vehicle emissions)—one for diesel vehicles and the other for petrol vehicles—to carry out emission testing. Officials say, for the first time, motorcycles and scooters will also be tested.Though vehicle emission testing is mainly the responsibility of federal government agencies, the constitution also mandates local governments to take measures to reduce pollution, officials say.The metropolis has developed pollution control guidelines as per the KMC Environment and Natural Resources Protection Act-2021.Officials say these random tests will be conducted on vehicles that have passed emission testing from the department of transport management and received green stickers, as all four-wheelers on the road typically do. However, some may still emit black smoke for various reasons, including lack of timely servicing and maintenance.Many automobile owners only service their vehicles ahead of the annual pollution testing. “We will not issue green stickers to vehicles but check emission levels,” said Shrestha. “If we find vehicles emitting pollutants more than permissible levels, we will slap a fine.”According to the officials, Rs1,000 will be fined for polluting vehicles for the first time.Random vehicle testing is among the measures the city office is taking to tackle air pollution.The municipal environment department has also started monitoring the city’s air quality independently. For that, the city office has installed portable devices in various locations. “We have already installed portable air quality monitoring devices in 16 locations within the metropolis and are preparing to install three more,” said Sarita Rai, chief of the department. “We have also launched a drive to make people aware of air pollution.”Nepal’s air quality reaches hazardous levels several times a year, and the capital city often becomes the world’s most polluted metropolis.According to IQ AirVisual, a Swiss group that collects air quality data from around the world, Kathmandu’s PM2.5 levels reached 197 micrograms per cubic metre (μg/m3) on Friday afternoon.PM2.5 refers to particulate matter (solid or liquid droplets) in the air that is less than 2.5 micrometres in diameter. It is among the most dangerous pollutants that can get past the nose and throat to penetrate the lungs and get into the bloodstream. PM2.5 particles are small and likely to stay suspended in the air for long, increasing the chances of people inhaling them.As per the Environmental Protection Agency’s air quality index, when air quality reaches 151-200, it is considered unhealthy; everyone may experience problems, with sensitive groups feeling more severe effects.Major hospitals report a spike in respiratory problems due to the impact of toxic air and dust. Meanwhile, the city office said it had installed push-button traffic lights in 36 locations for the ease of pedestrians. “We are working to bring those devices into operation soon,” said Shrestha, traffic adviser of the metropolis. “Pedestrians can push the button to stop traffic and cross the road safely.”Push-button devices are installed at traffic intersections to allow pedestrians to request stop road traffic, so that they can cross the road without fear. \nNepali Congress candidate Krishnaman Dangol has been elected mayor of Kirtipur Municipality in the by-election held on Sunday. Dangol secured 5,334 votes, defeating his closest rival, Shivsharan Maharjan of the Maoist Centre, by 779 votes.Maharjan received 4,555 votes, while Surendra Manandhar of the CPN-UML garnered 4,337 votes.The by-election was held following the demise of former mayor Rajkumar Nakarmi, who passed away on July 26 last year due to a kidney-related illness. Nakarmi, also from the Congress, was elected Mayor in the 2022 local elections.Kirtipur, historically known as a left-leaning stronghold, saw a shift in political dynamics with Nakarmi’s victory in 2022. Kirtipur was declared a municipality in 1997. \nKrishnaman Dangol of the Nepali Congress has maintained a lead in the ongoing vote count for the mayor of Kirtipur Municipality. As of the latest tally, Dangol has garnered 789 votes, while Surendra Manandhar of the CPN-UML trails with 666 votes. Shivsharan Maharjan of the CPN (Maoist Centre) has received 465 votes. Among independent candidates, Rajman Maharjan has secured 418 votes, Dinesh Kumar Adhikari 236, and Kabikumar Maharjan 58. Rastriya Prajatantra Party’s Dhruba Maharjan has obtained 119 votes, while Bhanu Rijal of the CPN (Unified Socialist) has 22 votes.   \n\nThis year’s ‘Ncell Woman ICON ICT Award’ has been conferred to Bandana Sharma, who has been recognised for her significant contributions to the field of information technology. She recently received this prestigious award at the Grand Finale of the ICT Award 2024.Chief Minister of Karnali Province, Yamlal Kadel, and Ncell’s Corporate Communications and CSR Head, Bishakha Laxmi Khadka, jointly presented the ‘Ncell Woman ICON ICT Award 2024’ to Sharma. Currently serving as the Head of the Cards and Digital Banking Division at Nepal Bank, Sharma also received a cash prize of Rs300,000 along with the award.Every year, this award is presented to a woman who has made remarkable contributions to Nepal’s ICT sector. “We are delighted to continue this collaboration to encourage women in ICT and recognise their contributions,” said Bishakha Laxmi Khadka, Head of Corporate Communications and CSR at Ncell.Sharma began her career as an IT Support Officer at Nepal Bank in 2006. She has been instrumental in the bank’s digital transformation, contributing to core banking systems, network security, cybersecurity, and the development of customer-friendly digital services and infrastructure. \nIn June 2022, the Hotel Association Nepal announced a ban on single-use plastics starting January 1, 2025, as part of its commitment to reducing plastic pollution and promoting sustainable tourism. Single-use plastics are designed to be used once and thrown away.As the countdown begins, the initiative looks out of bounds for many hotels, particularly smaller ones, though big ones have already started phasing out single-use plastics.“Most luxury hotels have already implemented the decision,” said Binayak Shah, president of the Hotel Association Nepal, the umbrella body of the hotels and resorts in Nepal. “But for small hotels, whose occupancy is currently only a third of their capacity, it appears difficult.”Replacing plastic with glass bottles or eco-friendly products is expensive, said Shah.Single-use plastics commonly used in hotels include water bottles, straws, cutlery, plates, drink stirrers, expanded polystyrene food service products, toothbrushes, and combs. Nepal has 1,416 hotels, including star-rated and tourist standard establishments, offering a combined daily bed capacity of 54,370.Even in luxury hotels, eliminating plastic water bottles has been a big challenge, according to hoteliers.For example, a seal on a plastic water bottle certified with the NS mark ensures quality.“But no glass water bottles available in Kathmandu come with a seal and NS mark. This has put a question mark on quality assurance,” said Shah. “However, we are in talks with bottling plants. As this can be a big business opportunity, they are responding positively.”“The project may take some time to implement.”The plastic-free initiative, however, could provide a viable business prospect in Nepal, although it may initially be expensive.Bikas Khatri, director of Wave Nepal Pvt Ltd, a Kakani-based exporter of plastic bottled mineral water, said luxury hotels globally have started offering glass-bottled water to prioritise eco-friendly practices that align with modern consumer values.Unlike plastic, glass can be recycled indefinitely without losing quality, supporting a circular economy and helping businesses achieve sustainability goals.“Currently, we are getting orders for refilled water in ‘lock bottles’ from luxury hotels like Aloft, Marriott, and Hilton,” said Khatri. “Due to the high demand, we have ordered 20,000 glass bottles from India to launch the project, which will begin by mid-January.”The glass-bottled water will be distributed like Coke and Pepsi. A quality 500-ml bottle will cost Rs55 without adding transport cost. “So, after factoring in taxes and profit margins, a bottle may cost Rs100,” said Khatri. “This is the cost of the first delivery. By the fourth refill, the cost would be halved.” “It’s a trial. Based on demand, we are also planning to import a refilling machine worth around $35,000,” said Khatri.Most mineral water suppliers in Kathmandu use polycarbonate jars in addition to plastic bottled water.According to estimates, the Kathmandu Valley consumes 100,000 water jars daily. In the peak season or summer, the valley alone uses 30,000 cases (12 bottles each case) of plastic bottled mineral water. A five-star hotel, if fully occupied, consumes nearly Rs200,000 of water per day. Unlike plastic, glass is fully recyclable and can be used multiple times, making it an environmentally responsible choice. By reducing reliance on single-use plastics, restaurants and hotels significantly cut down on waste, contributing to a cleaner planet.Plastic is one of the most important innovations, but single-use plastic products have a severe negative impact on the environment. Plastic is a convenient comfort in today’s world because of its inexpensive production cost and wide range of applications.Single-use plastic products are more likely to end up in rivers than reusable options.Plastic is a non-biodegradable material and most plastic is made from fossil fuels. If burnt, it poisons the air; if buried, it pollutes the soil. And plastic wastes dumped haphazardly have been clogging sewer mains and rivers, and polluting oceans.Nepal still does not have effective waste recycling plants although several private firms have been recycling solid waste and producing compost manure on a small scale.According to an Asian Development Bank report, a waste composition analysis in Nepal indicates that the highest waste fraction is organic matter (66 percent), followed by plastics (12 percent), paper and paper products (9 percent), others (5 percent), and glass (3 percent). Metal, textiles, and rubber and leather each account for 2 percent or less.The most commonly found single-use plastic items in Nepal are plastic drinking bottles, littering rivers and rivulets. With the growing number of climbers, mainly on the world’s highest peak, Mt Everest, plastic waste has infiltrated the Himalayas and polluted freshwater sources.The International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development (ICIMOD) said in its report that Kathmandu alone uses around 4.7 million to 4.8 million plastic bags a day. In Nepal, 16 percent of urban waste consists of plastic, which is 2.7 tonnes of daily plastic garbage production, it said.Besides the sheer quantity of plastic waste being produced, a major problem with plastic is its resistance to degradation, ICIMOD said. A conservative estimate puts the average time for one single plastic bag to completely biodegrade at 500 years, it said.“This means not only that most of the plastic we use during our lives will outlive us, but that our plastic footprint also will affect generations to come.”In April 2015, Nepal declared Kathmandu a polythene bag-free zone. Several other areas have followed suit and declared themselves plastic-free, including Parbat, Myagdi, Damak and Ilam.Plastic bans in urban mountain centres like Gangtok and Nainital in India in the late 1990s have demonstrated that daily life is as comfortable with reduced plastic use, according to ICIMOD.Since January 2020, the Everest region, which has gained notoriety as the “world’s highest garbage dump”, imposed a ban on the use of plastic bags, bottles and other plastic items, citing their adverse effects on human health.The use of plastic bags thinner than 30 microns has also been prohibited.The Everest region has long struggled to manage the solid waste visitors to the region bring along every year.On October 21, the Department of Tourism announced a ban on plastic bottles in four- and five-star deluxe and luxury hotels as a part of its push towards environmental sustainability.  \nOver 1,500 children under five years of age from Banke district have been found suffering from malnutrition–either moderately or severely–in the last five months. The number could be even higher, as not all the children of the age group have been screened.“The number of the diagnosed cases were reported by the health facilities, where ailing children were taken for treatment or reported by female community health volunteers,” said Angad Bahadur Shahi, chief of the Health Office, Banke. “A separate screening programme has been started, which will tell the exact scenario.”Malnutrition is considered a silent health crisis in Nepal. The country has made significant progress in reducing stunting among children under five, which fell from 57 percent in 2001 to 25 percent in 2022, according to the Nepal Demographic and Health Survey-2022.However, the progress is not the same in all provinces. More than 16 percent of the children under five years in Lumbini Province [Banke district is part of Lumbini Province] suffer from wasting—the most immediate, visible, and life-threatening form of malnutrition.Child health experts say a sharp rise in moderately and severely acute malnutrition cases in Banke is alarming, which could hinder attempts to reduce malnutrition and overall hunger problems. The increase in the problems will also hinder the attempts to achieve the United Nations-backed Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). SDGs, a follow-up on the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), aim to end poverty, hunger and all forms of inequality in the world by 2030. Nepal has set targets to meet those goals.The country needs to reduce stunting to 15 percent from the existing 25 percent by 2030 to meet the SDGs targets, wasting to 4 percent from the current eight percent and underweight to 10 percent from the existing 19 percent.Wasting or underweight for one’s height in children, if not treated properly and on time, is associated with a higher mortality risk, according to the World Health Organisation.“Severe acute malnutrition is a medical emergency, and such children need immediate hospital admission and treatment,” said Dr Shyam Raj Upreti, a child health expert who is also the former director general at the Department of Health Services. “Detection of moderately acute malnutrition means the problems have started recently.” He said these indicators show that efforts to rein in existing malnutrition problems and end them permanently are insufficient.Malnutrition plays a major role in the under-five mortality rate. The problem also hinders children’s mental development and eventually affects the country’s economic health by weakening intellectual capacity, reducing productivity in adulthood, and increasing vulnerability to diseases, according to experts.Health authorities have taken various measures to address malnutrition problems, including distributing ready-to-use food and running nutrition rehab homes in 24 federal and provincial hospitals. Severely acute malnourished children get admitted and treated in those centres. Experts stressed addressing moderately acute malnutrition problems, which are likely to become severe if not treated timely.“Many people consider malnutrition only a health problem, but it is a multisectoral problem, which needs a multisectoral approach to deal with,” said Upreti. “Treating severely malnourished children does not stop the problems. We need to address the poverty of their families.”Experts said non-health interventions—awareness drives, improved financial conditions of people, their education levels, and sanitation conditions—could go a long way in improving health indicators, including nutrition status.“We have made a multisectoral nutrition plan to address the existing malnutrition problems,” said Lila Bikram Thapa, chief of the Nutrition Section at the Family Welfare Division under the Department of Health Services. “Sincere efforts of all concerned stakeholders can address the existing problems.”Malnutrition affects the physical as well as mental growth of children, which ultimately affects the country’s economic health, according to experts. \nThe Ministry of Health and Population said that a decision on whether to lower the iodine content in salt will be taken only after a micronutrient status survey, which will start in May next year.The nationwide survey to be carried out after 10 years, with the financial support of USAID and technical support of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, will be completed in 2026.“The decision to lower the iodine content in salt will be taken only after assessing the level of iodine in the urine of children and pregnant women,” said Lila Bikram Thapa, chief of the Nutrition Section of the Family Welfare Division under the Department of Health Services. “We hope the new report of the micronutrient survey will help us make appropriate decisions.”Iodine is a mineral found naturally in seafood and plants that grow in areas near the sea. In places where iodine is naturally rare, it needs to be artificially introduced into the diet via fortified food products.The Salt Trading Corporation, the agency responsible for importing and distributing salt in Nepal, fortifies iodine at 50 ppm (parts per million) per kilogram of salt, which is higher than the recommended dosage. The World Health Organisation, however, recommends iodine concentration at 15 to 40 ppm per kg. Only 40 ppm of iodine per kilogramme of salt is fortified for India, as it is assumed that the Indian population does not need as much iodine as the Nepali people, since they also get iodine content from foods produced near the ocean.Health experts in Nepal have blamed the excessive amounts of iodine content in salt for the rise in non-communicable diseases, including hypothyroidism.Several studies—including the 2016 Nepal National Micronutrient Status Survey jointly carried out by the World Health Organisation, UNICEF, the US-based Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, and the Ministry of Health and Population—found that Nepalis consume excessive amounts of iodine, which has resulted in high prevalence of hyperthyroidism, a condition when the thyroid gland does not produce enough thyroid hormones.The survey showed that more than two-thirds—68 percent—of the population across the country is consuming iodine far in excess of the recommended levels.According to the Non-communicable Disease Risk Factors: Steps Survey-2019, 5.6 percent of the adults (6.5 percent of women and 4.6 percent of men) reported adding salt often or always to food right before or while eating.Additionally, 19.5 percent of the adults (18.1 percent of the women and 21.1 percent of men) reported consuming processed foods that are often or always high in salt.Doctors in Nepal suspect that the high iodine content in the salt being sold in Nepal could be among the reasons for the high prevalence of several non-communicable diseases, including thyroid disorders and hypertension.A change in dietary patterns and an increased consumption of processed foods (including packaged soups) have resulted in an increased prevalence of non-communicable diseases such as hypertension and cardiovascular diseases, they added.Earlier, the government had sent a team of experts to salt factories in India’s Gujarat state to study the iodine fortification process and the possibility of lowering the iodine content in salt. The expert team furnished its report, but the concerned authorities could not decide on the reduction of iodine level in salt.“We have decided to wait further until the report of the planned survey comes,” said Thapa. “The report will help us analyse what changes have happened in the last 10 years and make appropriate decisions.”In 1993, Nepal mandated that salt be fortified with iodine to prevent health problems caused by iodine deficiency, as salt is both cheap and used round the year.Officials said the higher iodine level was mandated for Nepal under the assumption that transport and storage times were longer at the time as the salt had to be carried on the backs of men and animals and some amount of iodine would dissipate by the time the salt reached markets, mainly in the remote parts of the country.However, with roads reaching almost all corners of the country, transportation time has significantly decreased, so there is no need for such a high level of iodine in salt, say doctors.The World Health Organisation recommends less than two grams of sodium or five grams of salt per day for adults to reduce blood pressure, and cut the risks of cardiovascular diseases and stroke. \nThe Ministry of Health and Population is preparing to launch a nationwide campaign offering the public free screenings for certain non-communicable diseases—hypertension, diabetes, and renal function, among others—in the ongoing fiscal year.The move aims to make people aware of the growing burden of non-communicable diseases, which account for around 80 percent of total deaths, officials say.“As per the instruction of the health minister [Pradip Poudel], we are planning to launch a nationwide campaign to screen for certain non-communicable diseases,” said Dr Yadu Chandra Ghimire, director of the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division. “The campaign will be launched in the month of Falgun (February 13 to March 13).”Non-communicable diseases—hypertension, diabetes, renal disease, liver problems, heart problems, and cervical cancer, among others have emerged as major killers in recent years, accounting for around 80 percent of total deaths. According to a 2019 study on the prevalence of non-communicable diseases by the Nepal Health Research Council, 71 percent of total deaths at present were due to non-communicable diseases, and an additional eight percent of deaths were linked to injuries. The study was primarily focused on behavioural risk factors like tobacco and alcohol consumption, as well as biological risk factors like high blood pressure, overweight, obesity, abnormal lipid levels, coronary artery disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and diabetes. Officials hope that free screenings for non-communicable diseases will help raise awareness of risk factors and ultimately help lessen the disease burden.“This campaign aims to make people aware of the emerging risk factors caused by our changing lifestyle, food habits, and stress levels, among other things,” said Ghimire. Officials say that health workers will also organise outreach camps in remote areas where people must walk for hours for health screening.“The main purpose of the free screening campaign of non-communicable diseases is to make people aware of the problems,” said Dr Pomawati Thapa, chief of the Mental Health Section at the division. “The burden of non-communicable diseases has been raised alarmingly of late, and people are seeking care only when the problems worsen.”Early diagnosis and precautionary measures can help stop health problems from becoming serious, doctors say.Public health experts say that it is high time to focus on non-communicable diseases, as their burden has raised alarmingly. As most people do not undergo testing unless there is an emergency, doctors say it may be too late when the symptoms surface. They say that many lives could be saved if testing of non-communicable diseases is made free.Along with free testing, authorities must focus on behavioural changes—improvements in eating habits and physical exercises, among other things.“Countries like ours have been facing a double burden—an alarming rise in non-communicable diseases and the emergence of new vector-borne diseases and other communicable diseases,” said Dr Mingmar Gyelgen Sherpa, former director general at the Department of Health Services. “Due to excessive use of processed foods, which contain preservatives, people suffer from multiple non-communicable diseases.”Several studies show alarming signs on a number of issues including growing consumption of alcohol, tobacco, salt and junk food, and insufficient intake of vegetables and fruits, which lead to cardiovascular diseases. Doctors say that along with ensuring free screening and treatment, authorities concerned should focus on raising awareness about lifestyle changes and associated risks. \nWith the confirmation of the second mpox case in Nepal, the Ministry of Health and Population has stepped up surveillance measures to prevent a possible outbreak of the deadly viral disease.Nepal reported the latest case on Friday. A 36-year-old man from Tanahun, who returned from Saudi Arabia on Thursday, tested positive for the disease. Nepal confirmed its first case of mpox infection in June last year, when a 60-year-old foreign national had tested positive.“We have increased health screenings of passengers entering the country from abroad, as per the instruction of the Ministry of Health and Population,” said Kanchhi Maya Twanju, a health worker deployed at the health desk set up at the Tribhuvan International Airport. “We have been instructed to send passengers having fever and those showing symptoms of mpox infection directly to hospitals.”Mpox is a rare disease caused by infection with the mpox virus and one in 10 infected persons can die. Most common in remote parts of central and west Africa, the disease has now been reported in at least 122 countries. Beyond Africa, monkeypox is spreading chiefly in men who have sex with men, putting sexual health clinics on alert for new cases.Along with stepping up screening of the passengers entering the country via TIA, health authorities have requested dermatologists throughout the country to refer suspected cases for testing.“We have alerted dermatologists about the risk of an outbreak of mpox virus in the country and have requested them to refer suspected cases for testing,” said Dr Yadu Chandra Ghimire, director of the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division. “We will take additional measures following consultations with stakeholders, including the World Health Organisation’s Nepal representatives.”Public health experts in Nepal say that screening suspects at health desks at international airports and land crossings is not sufficient to prevent outbreaks since it usually takes between five and 21 days for the first symptoms of mpox to appear, and not all cases of infection can be detected at health desks.Monkeypox cases have been reported in neighbouring India, with which Nepal shares a long, porous border. India has recorded at least 30 mpox infections since 2022.Health experts say that even if the rare viral infection is usually mild and most people recover within weeks, the risks should not be underestimated. They stress precautions, saying that every disease seen in any corner of the world can come to Nepal due to the high mobility of people.“We didn’t expect that the infected person would come from Saudi Arabia, as there is no outbreak currently,” said Dr Sher Bahadur Pun, chief of the Clinical Research Unit at Sukraraj Tropical and Infectious Disease Hospital. “This incident shows that the deadly disease may come from any country, and we must remain vigilant and prepare agencies concerned accordingly.”Doctors say preventing an outbreak of the deadly viral disease is not the sole responsibility of a single health agency, and it is impossible to do so.“Every agency and person, including passengers, should shoulder the responsibility and take preventive measures,” Pun stated.Mpox has been a globally neglected public health problem in parts of Africa for decades. The disease came to widespread attention after May 2022, with countries outside Africa reporting new cases.Mpox has since spread globally. More than 100,000 people from 122 countries have already tested positive for the disease.Its symptoms include fever, headache, swelling, body pains, exhaustion, and itchy rashes on the face, hands, and feet.As the disease primarily spreads through close person-to-person contact, public health experts recommend self-isolation and good hygiene to avoid it.Meanwhile, health officials informed that the condition of the infected man is normal and he will remain in hospital isolation for an additional two weeks.They said that they are also working to trace close contacts between the patients on the plane and the taxi driver who took him to the hospital. \nThe holiday season has its rules, from its distinct colour palette to the cold weather. Listen closely, and you can hear the sound of bells jingling with their particular charm.If you are like me, the best thing to do during this time of year is to make yourself cosy in bed, wrap your blanket tightly, and snooze the alarm until the very last minute before being pulled by daily mundane routine. But once you start to see the familiar shades of red and white peeking through the decorations and hear the distinct tune of ‘All I Want for Christmas Is You’ by Mariah Carey blasting through every department store you visit, with the smell of cocoa drifting through the air, you begin to grin from ear to ear, knowing that the holiday season is here. For me, this time of year is all about my friends and family, the warmth they provide through their presence, the never-ending chats, hand warmers, and not to forget my annual passionate love affair with electric heaters! (Trust me, we two are inseparable!). The sounds of carols and bells reinforce my passion for baking, but then again, it might just be the cold weather tempting me to make something special for my loved ones to reciprocate the warmth and affection they provide me.

The dishes will be available for order from 12:30 pm to 10:00 pm every day till August 30. In celebration of Nepal’s rivers and lakes, which provide an ideal environment for high-quality trout, the Director of Culinary Food and Beverage Service, Chef Utpal Mondal, and his team at Dusit Princess Kathmandu have crafted a menu showcasing the flavours and versatility of locally sourced trout. “As the festive month of Shrawan ends, people focus on healthy and nutritious food. Trout, rich in omega-3 fatty acids, vitamins, and essential minerals, offers a heart-friendly option that checks all the boxes from a nutritional and culinary standpoint,” says Mondal.He adds that the goal of the culinary event is to offer their guests a rare opportunity to experience a wide variety of trout dishes they wouldn’t typically find at home.The event menu features twelve unique dishes, six of which are drawn from diverse culinary traditions across continents. Three dishes are inspired by oriental cuisine, while the remaining three highlight flavours from Nepal and India. The menu has been designed to include various dishes, from soups and starters to main courses, including Mexican, Italian, Continental, and Thai flavours.While discussing the event’s highlights, Mondal said, “The celebration presents a unique opportunity for guests to indulge in a diverse range of trout-based dishes, something they wouldn’t typically have the chance to experience elsewhere.” \nI can vividly remember my first encounter with baking when I was 10 years old. We had just moved to our new home and got a cable connection. The cable opened a world of possibilities, as it gave me access to various contents.This was back in the late 2000s when YouTube would take hours to load, taunting us with its buffering screen. I was particularly drawn to travel and lifestyle channels, mainly TLC, Fox Life, and Food Network, which kept me informed about different foods and cultures. I don’t know why, but I was always drawn to desserts. It was fascinating to see how these miraculous treats made people smile at the end of the meal.Growing up in Nepal, I noticed that baking wasn't very common. While some families did have ovens, they were mostly multifunctional ones used primarily for heating food.I also noticed that most of our desserts didn't require an oven, as they could be made on a stovetop. So, you can imagine my excitement when my mom decided to buy an oven during one of her festive shopping sprees.I could finally feel the joy these channels portrayed. (I blame food writer Nigella Lawson for getting me hooked on a domestic lifestyle.) Then, one day, after watching one of the cooking episodes on television, I finally mustered enough strength and decided to bake something. I distinctly remember wanting to make a chocolate cake for myself after watching one of Rachel Allen’s bake series. I watched all the ingredients used in that recipe and scurried across my pantry, only to realise I didn’t have half of the stuff she mentioned. I then decided to improvise the recipe (a big mistake). I randomly combined the ingredients that I had in a mixing bowl and chucked the batter into my oven, hoping for a magical cake to pop out an hour later.After I saw the result an hour later, I was mortified. The cake was stuck in the pan, refusing to come out, and it was as dense as fudge. I convinced myself that the taste was what mattered most, but when I served a slice to my brother, he made a face of utter disgust.That was the day I realised that baking soda was not the same as baking powder.After this incident, I researched baking and found out it was technical. This was a blessing in disguise for me, as I loved science, and I started to view baking as a science experiment. I then reflected and evaluated how to perfect one's baking skills.I analysed my errors and noted down all the steps I did every time I baked. Home baking is a passion for many. The idea of turning a few simple ingredients into a delicious masterpiece is as enchanting as it sounds.Yet, for many of us, this seemingly magical process can often turn into a series of unfortunate events, leading to crumbled dreams and deflated ambitions. Dense cakes, burnt crusts, rock-hard cookies and unrisen bread, if you are an amateur baker, then you have seen it all. But why do these mishaps happen so often? And most importantly how do we overcome them?From my experience, behind every successful bake lies a series of challenges and mishaps that test even the most dedicated bakers. Baking has its own set of rules that you need to follow to get that scrumptious treat every time. So, to transform a recipe into an actual dish that will impress your friends and family, I am sharing with you some of the tips and tricks I learned from my tumultuous journey as a home baker.First things first, we have to look into the prime appliance that we are working with. Commercial ovens are of two types: one that runs on gas and the other that runs on electricity. We have to look at the oven present at our home and consider its pros and cons. The main benefits of a gas oven are its size and temperature control. One can quickly change the temperature just by twisting the knob, and it preheats much more quickly than an electric one. However, they are known to have uneven temperatures at times and release more humidity, making it harder to properly crisp or brown food. This can result in burnt edges and cold or hot spots. An electric oven, on the other hand, provides more even and consistent temperatures and doesn’t release as much moisture in the air.This dry oven environment makes it easier to brown your items, making it great for baking bread. However, while the dry oven results in more even cooking, you also run the risk of drying out cakes and other baked goods.Also, many people forget to preheat the oven before baking, which is crucial for maintaining an even temperature throughout the baking process. When baking cakes and bread, I like to place a small tray of water at the bottom of the oven to provide moisture and prevent the baked goods from drying out.An oven thermometer can be a baker's best friend, providing a true reading and ensuring your creations bake evenly. I also like rotating the pan midway while baking, as it allows for an even distribution of heat.The next thing people mess up on is measuring and the specificity of ingredients in a recipe. Our moms made our food with their instinct; it is something that they learned along the way, but when you are baking, you cannot instinctively add or omit a few steps.I think that is why we initially had problems with baking. In a culture where cooking comes instinctually, baking challenges us, to be precise. A gram of more or less of any ingredient can drastically alter the outcome. Different methods of measuring flour can yield different results.Every component in baking serves a distinct purpose and function. Flour offers structure, sugar adds sweetness and moisture, eggs bind things together, and butter enhances taste and texture. However, not all ingredients are created equally. For example, using salted butter instead of unsalted might change the taste profile of your meal.Similarly, different flours have varying protein concentrations, which affect the texture of baked goods. The type of sugar used also makes a difference. Granulated sugar, brown sugar, powdered sugar, and speciality sugars like turbinado or muscovado each add unique flavours to a bake.Understanding these nuances and how they interact is critical for getting the intended outcomes. Accurate measurement tools and techniques are essential, but mastering them can be a steep learning curve. So, I would recommend investing in a kitchen scale that allows for more accurate measurements by weight rather than volume.Moving on, leavening agents such as baking soda, baking powder, and yeast are required to make baked goods rise. However, they can also cause confusion and errors. Baking soda needs an acidic component to activate, but baking powder has both an acid and a base, making it self-activating.Using the wrong type of flour or sugar, or using them in incorrect proportions, can result in flat, overly raised, or collapsed cakes. Yeast, being a living organism, presents its challenges.The water temperature must be just right—not too hot to kill the yeast, nor too cold to inhibit its activity. Proofing times and conditions also need to be carefully managed to achieve the perfect rise.Bakers should also be careful about the way they mix ingredients. The method of mixing ingredients can significantly impact the final product. Over-mixing can develop too much gluten in cakes and pastries, leading to tough textures.Under-mixing can leave pockets of unincorporated ingredients, resulting in uneven bakes. Techniques like folding, creaming, and whipping each serve specific purposes and must be executed with care.Finally, home bakers must understand the importance of timing and patience in baking. Even a minute or two can make the difference between perfectly baked cookies and burnt edges.Recipes often provide a range for baking times, but factors like oven hot spots, pan material, and altitude can affect these times. It’s crucial to keep a close eye on your bakes and rely on visual and tactile cues, such as a cake pulling away from the sides of the pan or a toothpick coming out clean, to determine doneness.Baking is also an exercise in patience, a virtue not everyone possesses. Doughs need time to rest and rise, flavours need time to meld, and baked goods need time to cool before they can be enjoyed.Impatience can lead to underbaked centres, crumbling slices, and a general sense of frustration. Cultivating patience is as important as mastering any technique in the baker’s repertoire.Home baking is a journey full of ups and downs, but it comes with great rewards. The obstacles encountered teach valuable lessons in patience, precision, and perseverance.The satisfaction of success, the freedom to create, and the therapeutic benefits make the endeavour meaningful. Whether baking for oneself, loved ones, or as an artistic outlet, the journey is as fulfilling as the result. Embrace the flour-dusted countertops, occasional setbacks, and the joys of home bakingFor a beginner-friendly recipe that involves mixing ingredients and delivers amazing results, try my recipe for fudgy, nutty brownies that I call ‘Bliss Brownies’.Bliss Brownies150g unsalted butter plus extra for the tin150g chopped dark chocolate200g caster sugar½ tsp baking powder2 eggs80g cocoa powder150g plain flour70g mixture of nuts (walnuts and almonds)60g blended papayaMix all the ingredients (except the dark chocolate and nuts) in a blender or a food processor and blitz till you get a smooth paste.Fold the chocolate and the nuts into the brownie batter, making sure that the pieces are evenly mixed in.Grease a loaf pan with soft butter and dust with cocoa powder. Pour the batter into the loaf pan.Bake in a preheated oven at 170c for 40 minutes and let it cool in the oven for an hour. Enjoy with a cup of coffee or, as I like it, a scoop of vanilla ice cream. \nOne morning on a fading Tuesday of our vacation, I couldn't shake off the worry that my hard-earned savings from tutoring were slipping away faster than I’d planned. Out of nowhere, I messaged my friend Santona on a whim: ‘A trip to Rara’. With little hope, I awaited her reply, and I have no idea what I’d have done if she had denied it. However, just like the phrase “waiting for the nudge,” she enthusiastically agreed, and soon we roped in our friend, Nirjara.This wasn’t our first trip together—we’d ventured to Pokhara, tried bungee jumping, paragliding, and trekked trails like Khuma and Korchan since our first year of bachelor studies. My idea this time was a well-packaged tour, but plans changed, and new destinations were chosen. The pristine Tilicho Lake became our goal. Without overthinking, I agreed; after all, it’s Nepal and here, no matter where you decide to trek, you’ll experience heaven.From Kathmandu to Manang: Green Lake and apple delightsTravelling to Manang was a meditative experience in itself. As a scout exploring different parts of Nepal, I had often embraced the rush of adventure. But here, by the serene Green Lake under the sun's warm glow, I felt a genuine sense of accomplishment: ‘We’ve finally made it—without getting lost and in the right place.’ We clicked photos, laughed, and even made some silly TikTok videos. The famous apple farms of Manang called out to us with their irresistible offer: a feast of apples for just Rs200. If you’re travelling here, catching the early bus ensures Manang’s charm unfolds entirely by the end of the day.Khangsar to Tilicho Base Camp: rocks and rantsAn early morning jeep ride brought us to Khangsar. The trek was said to take 5-6 hours, but once we started, I moved ahead of my friends, a habit I don’t quite understand. I wondered if my friends would make it before dark. To my relief, their laughter and chatter soon filled the air, joining me.Then we set off into the landslide area, with jagged rocks above hanging like wind chimes ready to fall. We promised not to look up and remained focused on the trail. The journey was filled with everyday conversations from patriarchy to childhood TV shows, and before we knew it, the night wrapped around us as we arrived at the base camp. After some confusion over our booking, we finally settled in, ate quickly, and fell asleep. One tip: keep an eye on your things at Shrikharka—I lost my trekking poles there.Tilicho Lake: A view, a void, and acceptance Morning arrived. We emptied our room and set out, uncertain if we’d return in time and head straight to Shrikharka or stay the night again at base camp. One friend battled altitude sickness but pushed on fiercely, even bargaining for a horse ride, only to find me eventually outpacing it.As I neared the lake, the solitude and distance overwhelmed me. I called my father, who offered only a few comforting words before the line dropped. Thankfully, friends from home Nuya and Shri reached out, and I poured my thoughts to them through tears. With renewed spirit, I moved forward and finally reached a quiet pond that tricked me into thinking I’d arrived. Only after some guidance did I stand before the actual Tilicho Lake.Strangely, I felt no rush of joy. The sight was majestic, yet my reaction fell flat. I asked myself if it was okay to feel so indifferent. However, I accepted that sometimes it’s okay to feel nothing at all. A simple “I don’t know” was all the answers I needed.We had no rooms left on our last night at base camp, so we slept in a dorm, which was a cheaper and warmer option. After dinner, my friends drifted off, but I lingered by the fire, unwilling to leave its comfort. The dining hall was full of trekkers glued to their seats even after finishing their food until a friendly trek guide offered us seats. These guides, cheerful and chatty, shared fun stories and gossip.Ultimately, I want to say to all who recently went trekking, whether funded by parents or your hard-earned savings, to be proud and grateful for the opportunity to explore. And for those who couldn’t go this time, trust that your moment will come. Keep moving forward with hope, knowing that one day, your adventure awaits. \nThe noise of ever-growing traffic, the breaking and mending of black-topped roads, and an ever-expanding concrete jungle are some features that one would associate with the Kathmandu Valley.It is a wildly growing urban forest quickly transforming into a busy metropolis where every inch of space is ready to be sold and built. Yet, pockets of the past remain—small, peaceful neighbourhoods where houses are still made of wood, paths are made of stone tiles, and the stillness of a world that wants to stay intact and immobile. These places are known for tourism, culture, and the restoration of community pride. One such stop is the quiet village of Khokana in southern Lalitpur.Khokana is comparatively close to the mainland urban Lalitpur; from the ring road junction of Bagdole, it takes only a 10-minute drive to reach there. From the airport, you can take a cab directly to Khokana, which will take around half an hour. Get your cameras and hiking boots ready; the area is filled with historical artefacts and hiking trails.However, it is vastly different from the city. It is much nearer to the hills, where stone-paved paths, which could easily be goat trails, are rare in today’s Kathmandu.One such goat trail leads to Sikali temple, a major attraction of the area and accessible only on foot. The pavements are lined with big and small temples on each side, along with ponds that serve as clean water sources and a location for religious rituals. The houses are made of bricks and wood. The concrete invasion, although present, is minimal. Scattered every few hundred metres are small mustard oil mills, co-operative businesses of the locals of Khokana that have existed since medieval times.A site well-recognised for its historical significance, Khokana was even proposed to be made a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1996. Sikali TempleAround an hour’s walk from the historic town, Sikali Temple can be reached, which is also the location for its famed Sikali Jatra.While it can be reached through any public vehicle, a more holistic and adventurous route is to follow the goat trails on the outskirts of Khokana. This route, albeit long, allows for great hiking opportunities, scenic views of the hills surrounding the Kathmandu Valley, and a close-up view of the mediaeval but well-maintained architecture of the local houses.Even if you lose the way, which is very possible, the locals are very welcoming and more than willing to guide you. The main temple itself is three stories tall, and built in the Pagoda style, a common style in many temples in the valley.It is surrounded by a lush grass field which plays the stage to the Sikali Jatra held every year. The temple, like many religious spots around Khokana, is dedicated to the local deity Shree Rudrayani.The Sikali Jatra, a five-day festival that serves as an alternative to Dashain for the Khokana locals, is filled with chariot dances, battle enactments, and storytelling celebrations in the worship of Goddess Rudrayani.Starting from Ghatasthapana in mid to late September, the Jatra is vibrant and an essential experience for every visitor. Historical Khokana townKhokana’s historical town is located around 5 minutes walking distance from the local bus park. The town complex, paved with hand-made stone tiles, is graced with the Indrayanee temple but also has many red-bricked houses built in the local Newari architecture, some of them centuries old.One such house is the ‘Khokana Museum’. Although closed, it is widely popular for being the first house to be lit with electricity in Nepal, as Chandra Shamsher did in 1911.The stand-holder of the first light bulb can still be seen, serving as a historical monument for everyone to see.Similarly, the town complex is also filled with Guthi houses, small ponds, and even the local Ward office. While the Ward office provides a wealth of information for visitors interested in the area’s history, the Guthi halls symbolise the strong community support culture of the locals.The ponds, a notable one present right opposite the Indrayanee temple, have stone taps and remind us of primitive ways of obtaining clean water—a practice many locals are still engaged in.Yet, these ponds are also religious locations, especially used in rituals in the Sikali Jatra.Finally, a stroll through the complex allows visitors to explore old houses and historical artefacts in the serene quietness of Khokana, while the small outlets and Choila places nearby allow you to enjoy the spicy duck or chicken delicacies at the same time.Overall, the historical complex is enough to transport visitors back to a glimpse of the medieval past of the Kathmandu Valley. Mustard oil millsThe most well-known feature of Khokana is its mustard oil mills, which have been operational for hundreds of years and have been using the same methods of preparation since their inception.These mills, scattered throughout Khokana, are often community-owned, and even the ones owned by certain individuals have almost exclusively employed locals.Despite the advent of modern machinery, there is still substantial demand for their products due to the assured guarantee.When I visited one such mill, the local staff informed me that the furnace and oil presser used by them were 300 years old, given by the Patan royalty even before the Shahs became king.In addition to buying pure, organically created mustard oil and pellets, visiting these oil mills offers many educational benefits for international and local tourists alike.Khokana offers visitors a unique glimpse into a preserved bubble of the past through its tranquillity, preservation of ancient lifestyle and cultural elements, and remarkable self-sustenance.  \n“How much oxygen do you have for the summit?”I think this is the kind of question a film producer would ask. But when you're on the mountain, the answer is never clear.I have worked for a long time in the film industry and different art areas, especially photography and engraving.Working in various fields and drawing inspiration from them has become a new normal for me. I have made this approach my way of life without even realising it.I took responsibility for producing the last movie I worked on and shot the behind-the-scenes footage for a documentary. By doing so, I witnessed the entire shooting process and the journey of a movie.In the snowy highlands of Turkey, we had to endure the consequences of the changing climate to shoot ‘About Dry Grasses’, directed by Nuri Bilge Ceylan. The highlands used to be snowy in January, but by the time we got there in the same month, there was no snow. Nature was changing. It was responding to what was happening—to what humanity had done to it. In the end, it snowed, and we shot the intense snow scenes we wanted. But since most of our days were sunny, unlike what the director wanted, we had to shoot in the sunset and sunrise hours. As crew members, we spent many days waiting for the sun to set.Production requires creating opportunities, finding solutions, and being creative for a work of art to come true. For this, patience, endurance, calmness, and timing are necessary. On the other hand, nature wanted us to listen to it and wait for the right time.During that time, I witnessed many of nature's lessons. For example, I experienced extreme cold for the first time. We endured temperatures ranging from -33 degrees to +55 degrees. By listening to nature, surrendering to its forces, and working within its limits, we managed to persevere.No matter how much you prepare or plan during the pre-production phase, if you are working in nature, remember that nature will always have the final say.The film was completed, released, and connected with audiences. Its success at Cannes 2023 was followed by my trip to the North Pole for my project. I returned with a mix of wonderful developments, joys, and challenges. During this process, I experienced life and death, happiness and sadness, losses and awards.I realised the value of being able to breathe comfortably a few days after my father's chemotherapy ended. Just a few days earlier, he had said, \"Well done, my daughter. I'm glad you went!\" All the anxiety and hard work, filled with fears at the beginning, were finally behind me.Before going to Everest, when I was on the verge of giving up, defeated by my fears, I remembered my father's words. Everest reminded me of what he said while struggling to breathe, adding a turning point to my life.What does it mean to say ‘life’s turning point?’ How many turning points can there be in life?Who am I, and what am I doing in this world? How well do I know my own limits? Can I find answers to these big questions? These thoughts sparked my dream of journeying to Everest. Now, after returning, I can say that it turned my life around.“How much oxygen do you need for the summit?” sounds more like “How much do you need to hold on to life?” How many reasons do you find that give meaning to your life, keep you alive, and allow you to breathe? How much can you endure in the face of obstacles, and can you keep believing that a solution will eventually come your way?Can these questions be separated from the idea of measuring and assessing something, from learning its quantity and financial value? Can everything be known with certainty? Should the journey be fully understood in advance, with all its promises laid out? Should it be viewed like a purchase with a price tag, asking, “Is this journey worth this much?”I had never trekked before and had no climbing experience. I had lived at sea level my entire life and had never been to a high altitude.However, this journey was not only about the physical climb but also an inner discovery. After losing my father to lung cancer, his breathing difficulties taught me the fragility of breath, life, and existence. I also mentally prepared myself for the physical challenges I might face. Despite all my concerns, could this journey help me understand the cycle of life and the resilience of the soul?So, how could I make this trek possible? How could I land in Nepal? Despite all the economic difficulties and the many things I felt needed organising, I did my best and believed in it.Since I was embarking on this journey, I felt I should share about my travels and inspire others.Starting with photography, cinema, and engraving, which are already integral parts of my life, I dreamed of documenting and sharing the inspiring aspects of this journey.After months of correspondence and dreaming, it all came true. Finally, I embarked on the journey with the goal of creating photographs, engravings, and documentaries. I learned a great deal from my travels in Nepal, from the people I met, and from every moments I witnessed. I felt incredibly fortunate to have been able to honour my father’s memory with the peace and serenity I experienced in the Himalayas.During my 15-day journey to Everest Base Camp, I encountered nature’s masterpieces at every turn. As concerns like “How will I endure?” and “How will I finish?” started to weigh on me, the mountains suddenly parted with the clouds and gazed down at me.It was amazing to witness the appearance of ‘Gods’ that I had never seen before, in such immense size and in such a close, awe-inspiring manner beside me during that silent walk.As someone who came from one of the most crowded cities in the world, Istanbul, while I struggled with my daily questions and uncertainties, trying to control everything, they stood there calmly, as if answering me.They were just there—before and after.My guide, Lakhpa Sherpa, always reminded me not to worry about how high we were, how long it would take to reach our accommodation, or what the weather would be like. He encouraged me to live in the moment, and he was right.He advised me to focus on my breathing, not to get thirsty, to eat enough, and to appreciate the extraordinary beauty of the journey. In the mountains, plans dissolve and each moment is embraced as it comes.All the good wishes, prayers, and everything encountered along the way were for the journey itself. The mountain was full of life, secrets, and everything I had wondered about.This 15-day journey to Everest Base Camp was a solo adventure, yet I wouldn't have been able to complete it without my guide, Lhakpa, and my porter. Additionally, I was fortunate enough to experience the hospitality, generosity, and honesty at Trekkers Paradise, which organised the entire journey and provided guidance.I witnessed how dedication and sincerity are crucial in completing a journey safely and healthily. Ghanshyam Sharma, from Trekkers Paradise and Sauraj Jhingan, a climber who summited the Everest in 2018, shared their experiences with me during the journey.They experienced the 2015 earthquake while they were at the Everest Base Camp.As a filmmaker, their role as actors, and attention to detail played a significant role in bringing my dream photography and documentary project to life.The sponsors of my journey were Turkish Airlines, The North Face, Apple, Canon, and Stanley. My supporters include Oscar International College and Nepal Film Campus. Throughout the journey, I shared many experiences, memories, and countless photos and images with my students.On my way back home after 21 days, I celebrated my birthday on the plane. From the right window, the Himalayas bid me farewell. I felt like I had opened a new chapter in my life, and I was certain that I would return.I had made many friends and memories in Nepal.For now, I will be working on a documentary and preparing for a photography and engraving exhibition titled ‘My Soul Beyond the Mountain’.To the Himalayas: This summer was spent with you, but we will meet again soon. \nWe spent five days in Sri Lanka two weeks ago, driving up and down the island, covering almost 70 percent of its territory. Our tour spanned over 1,000 kilometres, including hills, beach spots, and heritage and religious sites.Our first stop in Sri Lanka was Colombo’s Bandaranaike International Airport. We were greeted by a warm and humid breeze when we exited the airport. The host briefed us (a group of journalists) that heavy rainfall has affected areas across Sri Lanka since mid-May 2024. Rain and storms intensified on June 1, with the most significant effects in the south and west of the country. We were lucky to have no rain in the forecast.On the first night, we checked into the lavish Jetwing Lake resort, an opulent sanctuary amidst the lush landscape. The resort’s expansive grounds were a retreat, offering a glimpse of Sri Lanka's natural beauty. We feasted on delicious cuisine, every bite exploding with flavour, introducing us to the island’s famed culinary delights. On June 7, early morning, the sun shone brightly, previewing the promise of an incredible journey ahead. We set off early the following day, eager to explore the mysteries of this enchanting island. As we ventured further into the heart of Sri Lanka, the landscape revealed its majestic nature. We were astounded by seeing Pidurangala Rock, a 200-metre-high granite colossus just a kilometre north of Sigiriya. The short hike to Pidurangala Rock offered breathtaking views of Sigiriya and beyond. We climbed the steep steps and soon were rewarded with a breathtaking panoramic view of the surrounding landscape. It took us 30 minutes to climb. The sight took our breaths away and left us humbled in the presence of such grandeur. From the top are glorious vistas of the surrounding landscape and an incredible view of the majestic Sigiriya Rock. From there, Sigiriya Lion’s Rock is visible, standing alone. This was the place where demon king Ravana had his palace in the Treta Yuga. Believed to have been built 50 centuries ago, the palace is said to have had a unique lift for Ravana and his visitors. Ravana imprisoned Sita in one of the caves at the bottom of this humongous boulder. Sigiriya is a fifth-century fortress in Sri Lanka carved out of an inselberg, a hill of hard volcanic rock that soared high above the surrounding jungle. We spent two hours atop the rock, mainly taking photographs. We descended from Pidurangala Rock, filled with awe and a sense of accomplishment.The journey ahead seemed even more enticing as we ventured along the winding roads, heading towards our next destination.Cash-strapped Sri Lanka plunged into its worst financial crisis in more than seven decades in 2022, with a severe dollar shortage sending inflation soaring to a high of 70 percent, its currency to record lows, and its economy contracting 7.3 percent.Thanks to the growing number of tourists, Sri Lanka is now bouncing back.In Jetwing Lake, we met Kasun Pradeep Somasiri, a receptionist. He briefed us that the resort is now 50 percent occupied. “That’s a better figure now as we are recovering.”The travel and tourism sector is a significant income generator for Sri Lanka. However, the economic crisis, the Ukraine–Russia war, and China’s zero-Covid policy have jeopardised the industry.Tourism accounted for more than 12 percent of the country’s GDP in 2019 and was the third-largest source of foreign exchange reserves, behind worker remittances and the apparel industry.Sri Lanka was poised to be one of the world’s best holiday destinations due to its rich culture, wealth of natural resources, and diversity of accessible experiences.However, tourism-dependent Sri Lanka suffered its first major setback with the Easter bombings 2019. This led to the collapse of inbound tourism flows as international arrivals declined by 18 percent year-on-year, and tourist expenditure fell by 17.7 percent that year. This was immediately followed by two years of pandemic restrictions. Inbound visitors fell to just 116,600 in 2021.An acute balance of payments crisis forced Sri Lanka to preemptively default on foreign debt of over $50 billion in April 2022, triggering a crippling economic contraction with spiralling inflation.“Tourism is gaining momentum,” says Somasiri. “The British and Chinese have started to return to Sri Lanka.”January-August is the peak season for foreigners. “From December to April, local people travel for holiday purposes,” says Somasiri. Before we started the tour to other religious sites, our tour guide, Sampath Mayadunne, told us, “Don't take selfies with your back to Buddha.” Turning your back on a Buddha statue and some other religious sites to take photos and videos is a strict no-no.The most common sight across Sri Lanka is the tank cascades system, an ancient irrigation infrastructure. The system is a network of small tanks draining to large reservoirs that store rainwater and surface runoff for later use.“These infrastructures were built by its ancient kings over 2,000 years ago to solve the water scarcity in the country’s dry zone,” says Mayadunne.On day two, we travelled to Ranweli Spice Garden in Matale. This garden is famous for its rare spices and herbs. A tour of the gardens will show you the cultivation, harvesting, cleaning, and packaging process, as well as the health benefits and uses of the herbs.On the way, we saw a colourful Muthumariamman Hindu temple, boasting hundreds of detailed sculptures in a rich mosaic of colour.In Kandy, we visited the Temple of the Tooth Relic (Sri Dalada Maligawa), one of the most sacred places of worship in the Buddhist world. It was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1988.The temple sustained damage from bombings by Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna in 1989 and by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam in 1998. However, it was fully restored each time.We then headed to Jetwing St Andrew’s, a luxurious 5-star property in Sri Lanka’s hill country of Nuwara Eliya, situated at 1,900 metres above sea level. During our stay in Kandy, we immersed ourselves in the city's charm and the serenity of the countryside. On the third day, early morning, we travelled to Nuwara Eliya, the area famous for tea estates that give many Nepalis the feeling that they have come to Kanyam, Ilam, in eastern Nepal.We visited a tea factory called Damro Labookellie Tea Centre, the oldest tea centre in Sri Lanka. Due to its cold climate, it is the most important area for tea production in Sri Lanka.In this tea factory, they make white and black tea, while the green tea is processed in another tea factory and then sent to Damro.After the tea factory tour and the tea tasting, we headed to Galle, our next resting point.We encountered narrow, winding, and maze-like streets and alleys in Nuwara Eliya, known as ‘Little England’. The town has preserved almost all its British-era buildings and is calm and beautiful. On our way to Galle, at the roadside, our tour guide stopped us at the famed Sita temple, which has Hanuman's footprints and is the place where Sita, wife of Lord Rama, was held captive by the demon king Ravana after he abducted her from India.We were at Sita Eliya, a temple named Sri Seethai Amman.When we reached the Hindu temple, rich in vibrant colours and architectural elements, it was full of devotees. The water stream adjoining the temple is believed to be where Sita bathed. Large footprints are found on the stones in the stream, and there is a saying that those belong to Hanuman, who came spying to find Sita’s whereabouts.In Ella, Ravana’s waterfalls are significant in the Rama-Ravana story. The cascade charms visitors from all over the globe. The waterfall is easily accessible and is known to have hidden caves at the top, which are believed to have been used as Ravana's residence.The 25-metre-tall waterfall is a beautiful cascade that provides the perfect backdrop for a photo to remember your Ramayana trail adventures in Sri Lanka. A short pilgrimage tour ended there, and it was now time for an adventure. Though it was not part of our itinerary, our guide decided to tour us on a train ride.Though short, only six kilometres from Ella to Demodera, it was thrilling. Everyone screamed in unison like kids on a fair ride to hear the echoes in the dark every time we passed through the tunnels. The sound of the train is subtly different inside a tunnel. For the first-timer, the darkness and shouts inside the tunnels when the train passes would be scary, like a horror movie.The train we boarded wasn’t crowded, but people had already filled the doorway, ready for the scenic journey.With the shrill sound of a whistle, the train slowly pulled away from the platform at Ella, passing houses, coconut trees and green fields.As the train progressed, tourists and locals were leaning out the windows and crowding to hang out the doors. I joined the crowd and hung out on a train. A short excitement ended there.After lunch, we headed to Galle and reached Jetwing Lighthouse. As soon as our group entered the hotel, they shouted with excitement.The hotel is on a rocky outcrop three miles west of Galle. Waves crash over giant boulders in front of it and produce howling winds.We were at Galle’s 17th-century fort five minutes from the hotel on day four. In the Bay of Galle on the southwest coast of Sri Lanka, Galle Fort was built first in 1588 by the Portuguese and lavishly rebuilt by the Dutch during the 17th century. It is a historical, archaeological and architectural heritage monument that maintains a perfect appearance even after more than 436 years.We then reached Hikkaduwa Beach, a popular beach destination on the southern coast of Sri Lanka. On the way, we saw a 30-metre-high Big Buddha Statue. It is a replica of the 6th-century Buddhas of Bamiyan destroyed by the Taliban in Afghanistan. It was created using the earliest known sketches of the statue. It was built in remembrance of the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami victims.We then travelled through the 222-kilometre-long Southern Expressway, Sri Lanka's first expressway linking the capital, Colombo, with Galle, Matara, and Hambantota, significant cities south of the island.On day five, we reached Colombo, the capital of Sri Lanka. Jetwing Colombo Seven hosted us in the bustling capital. We took a city tour early morning and visited Bally's Casino at night.On day six, we returned to Kathmandu early in the morning on a Sri Lankan Airlines flight, the airline that organised the trip in coordination with Jetwing Hotels Limited, a Sri Lankan hotel chain.National flag carrier Nepal Airlines, in its previous avatar as Royal Nepal Airlines, used to operate direct flights to Colombo during the 1980s. However, the carrier suspended operations following an armed movement by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) in Sri Lanka. There had been no direct air links between the two countries for decades.In 2016, Himalaya Airlines started a chartered flight that lasted a few months due to low traffic movement between the two countries. Sri Lankan Airlines started operating direct flights to Kathmandu in August 2021.“The main objective of this media tour is to increase tourism in both countries for mutual benefit. We want to draw Nepalis for pilgrims and leisure activities,” says Nilina Pathirana, Country Manager at Srilankan Airlines in Nepal.“We have understood that Nepali travellers tend to travel to Bangkok, Vietnam, Malaysia, Dubai, and Maldives. Nepalis have quite minimal knowledge about Sri Lanka and the religious connection between Lanka and Nepal. We want to promote Nepal and Sri Lanka jointly. This will be a win-win business,” added Pathirana.The airline said it currently carries 60 percent of the passengers from Nepal to Sri Lanka and beyond destinations like Tokyo, Sydney, Melbourne, and other Middle Eastern destinations. The return airfare for a 3.5-hour-long flight starts at Rs74,000. “We have a four-night, five-day package that begins from Rs80,000, depending on the properties and extended itineraries,” says Pathirana.Nepalis must submit certain required documents for visa processing, like their passport copy and bank statement. Due to this government-to-government policy, only Nepalis must obtain a prior visa. Otherwise, Sri Lankans are required to have a visa upon arrival.“The other best thing is that Sri Lankan Airlines can be involved with the visa process or facilitate the Nepalis tourists. Our main intention is to have a sustainable market in Kathmandu and make it a daily flight,” says Pathirana. \nMundhum Trek in Koshi province in the eastern part of Nepal is a new cultural walking trail. It passes through several indigenous ethnic villages and landscapes in Khotang and Bhojpur districts. This trail goes up to an elevation of 4,200 metres to the viewpoint of Silchung Peak and takes one through the settlements of the Kirati people. This route starts from Diktel Bazaar and passes through beautiful settlements like Chakhewa, Rawa Dhap, Salpa Bhanjyang, Silchung and Hanspokhari before ending in Bhojpur. There are some hotels in Diktel but trekkers are advised to carry tents. The trail offers panoramic views of most of the eight-thousanders, including Everest, Lhotse, Makalu, Cho Oyu and Kanchenjunga mountains. The spring season, March through May, is highly recommended for the trek.Janaki Mandir Janaki Mandir at Janakpur in Madhesh province was constructed in 1874 and is a blend of Mughal and local architecture. The temple is a three-storey building and has 60 rooms, making it the largest temple in Nepal. Pilgrims flock here by the thousands to pay homage to Janaki Mandir—Janaki being the other name of Sita, the daughter of King Janak. The temple houses an idol of Sita which was found near Ayodhya, the kingdom of Ram. The marriage anniversary of Lord Ram and Sita is celebrated in Janakpur every year on Vivaha Panchami, which falls in December. In the southwest corner of Janaki Mandir is the Vivaha Mandap, which has been built at the site where the marriage of Ram and Sita is said to have taken place. Another well-known temple in the vicinity is Ram Mandir, which is built in pagoda style and is hence different from the other temples in Janakpur that generally bear resemblance to Mughal architecture. It houses a female statue, said to be of Yogamaya, which has the reputation of being one of the most beautiful images of female forms in Nepal. Other holy sites of interest include the Laxman Temple, Sankat Mochan Temple and Hanuman Temple.Kuri Village, Kalinchok Kuri village, a popular tourist destination around 150 km from Kathmandu, lies at an altitude of 3,842 metres above sea level in Kalinchowk of Dolakha district, in Bagmati province. People visit the place to enjoy the snow during the winter besides the mesmerising landscapes and splendid panoramic view of the Himalayan range. Kalinchok gets snow mainly at the end of December and the snowfall continues till the end of February or mid-March. When there is snow, it is difficult for jeeps, buses and cars to reach the top of Kuri village. Chains are wrapped around the wheels of vehicles and specially modified jeeps with highly experienced drivers are used to carry visitors. There are several hotels and restaurants in the area. The road up to Kuri has also improved over the years.Annapurna Base Camp Annapurna Base Camp trek, in Gandaki province, makes for a picturesque journey that takes you to the foothills of the Annapurna South, up to 4,130 metres above sea level. The five-day trek (seven days for slow walkers) offers rich cultural diversities, typical Nepali villages and the flora and fauna nestled at the foothills of Annapurna. The distance from Pokhara to Annapurna Base Camp is approximately 81 kilometres. It is among the shortest and most budget-friendly treks in Nepal. For Nepalis, lodging costs around $5 to $10 per day. For foreigners, the overall cost of the trek ranges from $800 to $1500 on average per person. Annapurna Base Camp trek can be done at any time throughout the year as each season offers a different trekking experience. The ideal time for the trek depends on your weather preferences and what you expect from it. However, autumn (September to October) and spring (March to May) are considered the two best seasons for the trek, as the days at the time are warm and bright with clear skies.Bardiya National Park Bardiya National Park, located in the southern Tarai belt of Lumbini province, is home to one of the most elusive and majestic animals on earth—the Royal Bengal Tiger. The park, which covers an area of 968 square kilometres, is considered one of the most important protected areas in the country. It is a prime destination for those looking to catch a glimpse of a tiger. A bit of luck and patience will offer a good chance to see the Bengal Tiger. The jungle safari also offers one the opportunity to spot Asian elephants and the greater one-horned rhinoceros. The rare Gangetic river dolphins are occasionally spotted on rafting trips along the Geruwa River, the eastern channel of the Karnali river. Besides, visitors can enjoy the homestays and explore local Tharu culture. The right time to visit the park is from mid-September to mid-December and mid-February to May.Khaptad National Park Khaptad National Park in Sudurpaschim province is a protected area in the far western region. It stretches over four districts of Bajhang, Bajura, Achham and Doti and ranges in elevation from 1,400 to 3,300 metres. The park can be visited throughout the year. Trekkers are advised to bring their tents, food and other supplies. The Nepal Tourism Board says of late, social media has been increasingly influencing Nepali travellers to go to Khaptad. Since the far-flung Khaptad National Park is still offbeat for many travellers, the area remains pristine and fresh. The seasons of spring (March-May) and autumn (October-November) are the ideal times to visit the park. The temperature ranges from 10°c to 20°c offering pleasant trekking weather. The monsoon begins in June and lasts until September and during this time, roads often become muddy and slippery. From December to February, winter brings snow and chilling winds to the park.Limi Valley \nAiden Markram was 19 runs short of a test century at lunch on Friday as South Africa reached 180-5 on the second day of the first test in reply to Pakistan’s first innings total of 211.Markram has been under pressure after a series of low scores for South Africa but showed his value to the team with chanceless knock that left South Africa 31 runs in arrears with five wickets in hand at Centurion.He will resume on 81 with Kyle Verreynne (0 not out) after lunch, looking to build a lead for the hosts as they chase the win that would assure them a place in next June’s World Test Championship final.But two wickets for Pakistan in Friday’s morning session kept them firmly in the contest with both captain Temba Bavuma and David Bedingham dismissed in the first session.South Africa were 82-3 overnight with Markram and Bavuma putting on a further 54 runs before the skipper was dismissed, offering a thick outside edge to a delivery from Aamer Jamal and was caught behind for 31.Bedingham was characteristically attacking in his short spell at the crease, scoring 30 runs off 33 balls before extra bounce from Naseem Shah saw him edge to Kamran Ghulam in the slips.Markram was 47 overnight and moved quickly past 50 runs in the third over of the morning as Pakistan toiled for the first hour before they made their breakthrough.South Africa need to win one of the two-match series against Pakistan to reach the WTC final at Lord’s in June, adding extra pressure to the contest.They have won their last seven home tests against Pakistan. \nLocal pro Niraj Tamang extended the lead to seven strokes after the second round of the Surya Nepal Eastern Open, the third event under the Surya Nepal Golf Tour 2024-25, at the par-70 Dharan Golf Club on Thursday.Tamang carded 4-under 66 in the second round to post a 36-hole total of 12-under 128.

Obviously, a big, strong guy as well, so one of the guys who can hit the deck hard.\"And he obviously offers a role with the bat as well. We saw in the ODI that he can hold his own with the bat. We're excited for him to see what he can do with the red ball and strengthen our bowling line-up,\" added the South Africa captain.Chasing WinThe all-pace attack means frontline spinner Keshav Maharaj sits out. \"I think it's no different to what we've generally gone with.

There will be pressure that comes with that, but to be honest with you, we’re coming into the series to win the series 2-0, but we understand for us to do that, there's certain things that we need to do as a team.\"Keep things simple, keep doing the small things right and allowing the result to take care of itself,\" he added.South Africa team: Tony de Zorzi, Aiden Markram, Ryan Rickelton, Tristan Stubbs, Temba Bavuma (captain), David Bedingham, Kyle Verreynne (wicketkeeper), Marco Jansen, Corbin Bosch, Kagiso Rabada, Dane Paterson. \nTwo passengers on the Azerbaijan Airlines plane that crashed in Kazakhstan told Reuters that they heard at least one loud bang as it approached its original destination of Grozny in southern Russia.Flight J2-8243 crashed on Wednesday in a ball of fire near the city of Aktau in Kazakhstan after diverting from an area of southern Russia where Moscow has repeatedly used air defence systems against Ukrainian attack drones. At least 38 people were killed while 29 survived.“After the bang...I thought the plane was going to fall apart,” Subhonkul Rakhimov, one of the passengers, told Reuters from hospital.He said he had begun to recite prayers and prepare for the end after hearing the bang.“It was obvious that the plane had been damaged in some way,” he said. “It was as if it was drunk - not the same plane anymore.”Another passenger on the plane told Reuters that she also heard a loud bang.Survivors of the Azerbaijan Airlines plane crash share harrowing stories“After the bang...I thought the plane was going to fall apart,” Subhonkul Rakhimov, one of the passengers, told Reuters from hospital.He said he had begun to recite prayers and prepare for the end after hearing the bang.“It was obvious that the plane had been damaged in some way,” he said. “It was as if it was drunk - not the same plane anymore.”Another passenger on the plane told Reuters that she also heard a loud bang.“I was very scared,” said Vafa Shabanova, adding that there was also a second bang.She was then told by a flight attendant to move to the back of the plane.Both passengers said there appeared to be a problem with the oxygen levels in the cabin after the bang.Beyond the horror of the crash, the first-person narratives from the passengers gives an insight into what may have caused the disaster.Azerbaijan Airlines suspended a host of flights to Russian cities on Friday and said it considered the crash was caused by what it termed “physical and technical external interference”. It did not detail what that interference was.Four sources with knowledge of the preliminary findings of Azerbaijan’s investigation into the disaster told Reuters on Thursday that Russian air defences had mistakenly shot it down.Russia has said it is important to wait for the official investigation to finish its work to understand what happened.DRONE WARThe Embraer (EMBR3.SA) passenger jet had flown from Azerbaijan’s capital Baku to Grozny, in Russia’s southern Chechnya region, before veering off hundreds of miles across the Caspian Sea.It crashed on the opposite shore of the Caspian after what Russia’s aviation watchdog said was an emergency that a bird strike may have caused.Footage shot by passengers on the plane before it crashed showed oxygen masks down and people wearing life vests. Later footage showed bloodied and bruised passengers climbing out of the plane.After the turmoil of the crash landing, there was silence before the moaning of the injured began, Rakhimov said.The crash has underscored the risks to civil aviation even when they are flying hundreds of miles from a war zone, especially when a major drone war is underway.The Azerbaijan Airlines plane got into trouble near Grozny which is more than 850 km (530 miles) from the front lines in Ukraine, but still a repeated target for Ukrainian drones which have struck far behind Russian lines.Russia uses advanced electronic jamming equipment to confuse Ukrainian drone location and communication systems and a large number of air defence systems to shoot down the drones.Since Russia send thousands of troops into Ukraine in 2022, airlines have flown around Ukraine and Russia has closed major airports in southwestern Russia.Russia’s aviation watchdog said on Friday the plane had decided to reroute from its original destination in Chechnya amid dense fog and a local alert over Ukrainian drones.Rosaviatsia said that the captain had been offered other airports at which to land, but had chosen Kazakhstan’s Aktau. It said that it would provide comprehensive support to Kazakh and Azerbaijani investigations looking into the crash.Asked about reports that Russian air defences had mistakenly shot down the aircraft, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Friday he had nothing to add and did not want to give any assessments until the official investigation made its conclusions. \nChaaaiiittt…The spontaneous eruption of the sound of victory thundered through the neighbourhood of Nhyokha in the Kathmandu core. The line of a kite cut another. Looking out the window of her house, Sajani Shrestha saw children running full speed, shouting and fighting as they vied to catch the falling kite and thread. And craning her neck up to the sky, she could not count but only be mesmerised by the innumerable kites strewn across the skies of Nhyokha, Bangemudha, Indrachowk. “There would be so many kites that they entirely covered the blue of the sky, making beautiful patterns of different colours,” says the 51-year-old. “And you cannot imagine the number of times the call of chait rang in the air.”Clear blue sky and gentle westerlies, the season of kites has arrived in the Kathmandu Valley. While kites soared Kathmandu's sky mainly during Dashain, the kite season officially started in Nag Panchami (August) and ended on the Haribodhini Ekadashi (November). And from royalities to commoners, young and old all flew kites from rooftops and open grounds. Even those who did not, like Sajani, revelled in the live spectacle in the sky as kites soared and fought. With Bhimsen Thapa’s help, King Girvanyuddha flies kites The earliest written account of kite flying is believed to date to 200 BC in China. In Kathmandu, this tradition has religious and socio-cultural and environmental significance, says Tina Manandhar, lecturer of Nepalese History, Culture and Archaeology at Tribhuvan University. According to her, it is believed that kites in Kathmandu skies carry a message to the god of rain Indra that the valley's farmers have had enough rain for their crops. That is why Kathmandu farmers scolded anyone flying kites before plantation season.In an article ‘Changako Utpati Ra Bikas’ published in Gorkhapatra in 1995, historian Rajesh Gautam points to the lack of written documents indicating the exact time when kite culture was introduced in Nepal. Exploring different opinions on kite's introduction to Nepal, he writes that “some have opined the possibility that the skill and tradition of kite flying might have entered Nepal through India.” Yet some others, he writes, state that kites “came to Nepal from Japan during the time of [Rana PM] Dev Shumsher.”He concludes that most likely this tradition was introduced by Malla-era Newar traders: “But since Nepal’s relationship with Tibet and China is very old and direct, kites might have entered Nepal through the Newar traders who were engaged in the trade. One can estimate that the kite was introduced to Nepal during the (mediaeval) Malla regime.”In Social History of Nepal, TR Vaidya, Tri Ratna Manandhar and Shankar Lal Joshi write that there exists documented evidence of the kite flying from the early 19th century. The authors state that Sundarananda, a contemporary poet, has mentioned that the young king Girvanyuddha Bikram Shah (r.1799-1816), with the help of Prime Minister Bhimsen Thapa, flew kites from the towering temple of Taleju Bhawani, Hanumandhoka. And when the king's kite cut the kites of the youngsters, they were located and rewarded with money.In Tyas Bakhatko Nepal, Sardar Bhim Bahadur Pandey states that “During the month of Kartik [October-November] young and old all flew kites,” suggesting that kite culture was ubiquitous in Kathmandu by the early twentieth century.Anticipations and preparationsKite flying in Nepal requires a kite, a lattai (a wooden spool), thread and majha (homemade adhesive prepared by boiling snail slime, rice or sago, and powdered glass from burnt electric bulbs and coated on the line to sharpen it for kite fighting).77-year-old Nirmal Man Tuladhar, an avid kite flyer and retired professor of Linguistics at the Tribhuvan University, explains how Nepali tradition of kite flying was both expensive and needing advance preparation.“In our times, it wasn’t easy to fly kites,” he says. “We had to prepare majha …And as Nepali kites are fighter kites, we mainly fought with other kites [which meant we spent a lot of threads].”This preparation needed first and foremost of passing a hurdle: securing finances and materials to fly kites. While lattai was a one-time investment that could be saved for years, kites and threads had to be replenished every time a kite was cut.“Those were the times when parents wanted us to be more focused in our studies. They only gave money [to buy kites] after immense pestering,” says 80-year-old Dwarika Nath Dhungel, former Secretary of Nepal government, speaking of the 1950s and 1960s.Biodiversity specialist and botanist Tirtha Bahadur Shrestha, 86, was born in Mahabouddha and began flying kites from 1951-52. He saved what little money he got for afternoon snacks to buy Hattimar reel, a brand of line wound in a small lattai, which was strong and sharp and where majha stuck well.Raghuji Pant, a member of parliament, also recalls the difficulty in securing money to sustain his kite flying in and around Kathmandu core in the 1960s and early 1970s. “Four to five of my kites were cut in a day,” writes the 67-year-old in his 2019 article “Changa Jastai Udi Hidne Man” published in Himalkhabar. “[This caused] the line in the spool to shorten. From Bhadra [August-September] to one to one and a half months after Dashain I spent flying kites. So, it was difficult for me to have enough kites even after getting money from grandfather, grandmother, mother and everyone.”Kites and thread secured, now began the crucial work of preparing and applying majha whose strength determined how well it cut other kites. Govinda Tandon, 70, a historian and heritage expert, who grew up in Battisputali, was also an ardent kite flyer.“Materials for making majha were prepared right from the morning on a holiday,\" he writes in his article “Dashainko Butte Changa” published in Gorkhapatra. “Because this work couldn’t be accomplished without a collaboration of 3-4 friends, a holiday was set aside for this. Moreover, a sunny day was considered appropriate. If the majha didn’t dry, the thread could turn moist, and so if it felt like the day wouldn’t be sunny, the entire plan…was aborted.”Kite makers, kite sellers and variety of kites One of the oldest shops in Kathmandu's memory, Shree Chitrakar Kite Center in Tyauda, Asan is bustling with customers during Dashain. “When my grandmother got married and came to this house at age 12 [in early 1940s], this shop was already here,” says its fourth generation owner 47-year-old Dinoj Chitrakar. “So the shop must be around a hundred years old.”Another shop that stands out in Kathmandu's memory is Manandhar Kite Center in Kalimati, established in 1949, and currently run by brothers Mohan Man and Sundar Man Manandhar.In his book Antar Taranga, artist and writer Manuj Babu Mishra recalls “a kite shop near the old halwai shop of Chabahil” in the 1940s. Dhungel and his 1960 batchmates of Juddhodaya Public School recall the kite shops from the 1950s and 1960s – Bekhacha’s Shop at Netapacho, Bhaicha’s Shop at Nhyokha, Lata Manandhar’s Shop at Maru, Kanchha Buddha Bajracharya Shop at Tyauda.Besides the shops, there were makers and sellers of kites cloistered in different localities of Kathmandu Valley.In Kwalkhu, Patan was a Joshi who made Nepali paper kites.“One day I accompanied my uncle to buy kites,\" writes Dibya Giri, 69, in his 2023 article “Changa” in Sahitya Post. “I was amazed to see the huge stacks of kites there. We used to call it the house of the kite maker.”In Nhyokha, Purna Bahadur Shrestha began making kites as a teenager and started his own kite business in the 1950s, according to his daughter Sajani.These kites, made out of Nepali paper, often had different paintings. Mishra recalls painting kites for the kite shop in Chabahil.“I went to that kite shop and with the freely available colours and Nepali papers, I spent my day painting faces, birds, animals, masks, mountains, hills, whatever came to my mind,” he writes in the book. “Such kites apparently sold well!”Most septuagenarians and older generations like Tuladhar and Tirtha Bahadur recall flying kites made of Nepali paper when young. Tirtha Bahadur says that kites from Lucknow began coming to Kathmandu only after the late 1950s. But at least a section of Kathmandu was flying kites from Lucknow from the early twentieth century. Vaidya, Manandhar and Joshi write that the Ranas and Shahs imported kites from Lucknow and that from them, their favourite employees also got to fly some. These kites were large and, in Tyas Bakhatko Nepal, Pande writes that they were referred to as Lucknowia kites.Known for their characteristic hissing sound they made while flying, light body, swift movement and ability to take sharp turns, Lucknow kites were preferred by kite fighters.“Lucknow kites were lighter and could be manoeuvred well,” says Tuladhar. “Kites of Nepali paper were stable but difficult to manoeuvre. They were also expensive. So only some fighters flew Nepali paper kites.”The kites had different names depending upon their designs and colours – Ambe (a heart in the centre), Dibdibe (chequered), Pakhete (a different coloured paper on one edge), Sete (white-coloured), Nilchi (blue-coloured), Rate (red-coloured) and so on.The kite fighters preferred the strong and sharp Hattimar reel that came on a small lattai. The Belchamar reel was cheaper but weaker and prone to be cut by other threads. Kite fliers and kite watchers on rooftops and open groundsBibek Shrestha, 57, and his two brothers took stacks of kites and climbed their rooftops. The rooftops around theirs in the neighbourhood of Nhyokha – in fact in all core settlements of the Valley – were filled with kite fliers and spectators. Many risked precariously balancing on the sloped roofs.While Bibek and his brothers’ kites alighted to meet the sea of kites in the sky, their sister Sajani and other family members gathered around to revel in the live spectacle.Dhungel remembers the rooftops of Jhochhen and surroundings of the 1950s and 1960s swelled with kite fliers. Dhungel did try to fly kites. But he did not become a successful kite flyer. What he did become was, like Sajani and many Kathmandu residents, an admirer of kites soaring in the sky.“But more than engaging in my unsuccessful kite flying attempts, I enjoyed looking at the kites flying. There would be a big crowd of spectators. Females and other family members watched the kites fly as they ate meat and chiura. Some even drank and rejoiced as they flew kites.”When the age of cassette player and speakers dawned in the 1980s, songs blared from the speakers alongside kite flying. Chitrakar and Bibek invited their friends, put their favourite songs on speakers and spent entire afternoons flying kites, dancing, singing and eating.Away from the core cities, in the villages in the Valley, people flew kites in open fields. Like Dibya, who set his kite for flight from the banks of Godavari River in Tikathali. Chhauni was also a popular space for flying kites.Kathmandu’s joy in kite fightingBibek pulled his kite down and then manoeuvred it back up so his line touched his opponent's line from below and quickly reeled out his line. The resulting sharpness from the speed cut the opponent's line.Chaaaiiitttt………“The greatest fun comes from cutting another kite's string,” writes Tuladhar in his 1996 article “Cutting is the greatest fun” published in magazine Kite Lines. “With its coating of adhesive paste and ground glass, the string is as sharp and abrasive as sandpaper on your opponent's line.”Nepali kite, Tuladhar says, is made to fight other kites, and describes how a kite line cuts the other.“The technique is to touch your rival's string and immediately reel out line at high speed,” he writes. “The Nepalese style of kite flying is aggressive, and though the kites look simple, they are strategically designed for bringing down other kites.”At any given time, like Bibek’s kite above Nhyokha sky, skies above the Valley were filled with raging kites, swinging, coming down and going up as the fighters reeled in and out their lattais in ferocious attempts to bring down other kites.Meanwhile spectators cheered. “Even passersby stopped to look at the kites,” recalls Tina.The moment of a kite cutting was accompanied by the sound of chait, and children ran in the direction of the falling kite to grab it and the thread in what was termed as, Dibya says, changa lutne/dhago lutne.Dhungel always joined in to shout the chait resounding through the locality of Jhochhen and almost automatically his feet sped towards the severed kites' direction.“‘Oii leave that thread,’ the kite owner would scold me. ‘Why do you pull my thread, leave it right now.’ But I’d continue pulling the threads as the owner continued shouting. Other times I caught the kites that had failed to fly and dropped on the ground.”The fallen kites got stuck in the buildings, trees or poles, or glided down in the open grounds or paddy fields. Falling kites from the Kathmandu core settled down in Tundikhel covering it. Oftentimes kites fell on the fields to rest upon the lush paddy nearing its harvest.“Children ran straight into the fields to catch the kite,” says Dibya. \"They destroyed the crops by stepping on them. Some farmers chased them, scolding along as they did so and if they caught anyone, they slapped them.”Love and restrictions on kiteAmidst the raging kite fights high up in the sky, there were apparently also some quieter kites lingering much lower among the buildings or tree lines, for their goals lay in not ruthlessly cutting the threads of other kites but piercing softly through the hearts of their owners' love interests. During the Rana regime, there were designated public spaces to fly kites, writes Gautam in his article. Referring to oral accounts, he writes that the Ranas were particularly careful to avoid kite flyers around their durbars. This is because love-stricken men tied letters to kites and flew them into the durbars to their love interests among the nanis.He writes that the kites could be flown mainly on the grounds of Chhauni. Anyone flying kites in any other place and around Rana durbars were arrested.Pant also recalls love-stricken boys from his time. “Just as kites came in different colours and patterns, so did kite flyers,” he writes in the article. “Some wrote love letters using a few words in “symbolic language” on a plain kite and attempted to land it on the rooftop of the girl they liked. Some simply landed their kites on any rooftop if a girl appeared there and waited for reaction.”King Tribhuvan among kite fliersPande writes in his book: “Once or twice during kite season every year, King Tribhuvan went to Chhauni to fly kites. Legend has it that if the line of the king’s kite was cut, it flew to Lhasa. But since anyone who caught that kite received five rupees, everyone attempted to catch that kite.”In 2021 news report ‘Bhawanle Chhekidiyo Changa Udaune Aakash’ by Shivahari Ghimire published in Nayapatrika, cultural expert the late Satyamohan Joshi also recounts that “During Dashain, Tribhuvan came to the ground below Swayambhu to fly kites. […] He did not use the same thread to fly kites twice.”In the same article, Joshi says that the King also went to Budhanilakantha to fly kites and participate in kite flying competitions.End of season, end of cultureMohan Krishna Shrestha, 86, was born in Budhanilakantha. Every year, on the day of Haribodhini Ekadashi, he saw the annual fair at the Budhanilakantha Temple. He also witnessed kite fliers gathered in the open fields around the Temple.“Oh, it’d be a lot of people,” says Shrestha. “They came from all around Bhaktapur, Kathmandu and Lalitpur.”They flew kites on Ekadashi, Dwadashi and some even until Purnima.“They took all the remaining threads and kites that had survived Dashain and flew the last kites of the season,” says Tuladhar. “I remember my uncles, relatives and neighbours going to Budhanilakantha with their kites.”Joshi recalls in the 2021 article that King Tribhuvan also went to Budhanilakantha with his sons Mahendra, Himalaya and Basundhara. He greatly supported and also participated in the competitions there organised by the commoners. If he liked he gave prize money to the winners.This annual event lost its glory days after the decline in the open fields as buildings began to rise with the establishment of Budhanilkantha School in 1972, Mohan says.“The event survived in some form until the 1990s,” he says.But what happened after that?The end-of-the-season event in the 1990s was also an indication of the end of the age-old kite tradition.“If I go to my ancestral place in Asan to fly kites, it’s not possible for me to do that today because there are buildings everywhere,” says Tuladhar. “Cityscapes and urbanisation have created the obstacle for flying kites.”Dibya does feel like flying kites sometimes.“No space to fly kites today,” he says. “In the old times, there were river banks and open fields. Even if you fly kites, it gets stuck in somebody's rooftop or water tank or somewhere.”Yesteryear’s kite enthusiasts believe that increasing means of entertainment was another reason for the decline of kite culture.“When television came, kite flying started to slowly decrease,” says Bibek. “And then mobile phones robbed kite flying even more.”And so, when his sister Sajani cranes her neck up in the sky today, she rarely sees a kite.“Those days we heard one chait after another,” she says. “These days you won’t hear a single chait.” \nIn 2008 Matina Shakya was only three years old when she was appointed as the Kumari of Kathmandu. She was succeeded by Trishna Shakya as the new Kumari in 2017.Kumaris are revered as goddesses of beauty and strength in certain Hindu and Buddhist traditions. Worshipping young girls as Kumaris is a 2,000-year-old practice in Nepal. Since the 13th century, when the Malla kings ruled, the Newars of the Kathmandu Valley have been worshipping Kumari, a girl from the Shakya/Bajracharya community chosen to embody the divine energy of goddess Taleju Bhawani. The reign of a Kumari ends when she starts menstruating. So long as she is serving as the Kumari, she is believed to be the nation’s divine protector, safeguarding it from evil. Matina, 18, is now in her first year of college, studying for a bachelor’s degree in management. Her father, Pratapman Shakya, when asked about having a daughter who is the only living the goddess in the world said, “Not having your own daughter live in the same house as you seemed a little unfair, but we feel very proud to call ourselves the parents of the royal Kumari who is revered by people all over the world.”On March 9, 2023, he, along with Matina, were getting ready for a special function held to honour all former Kumaris from across Nepal. “There are often events to honour Matina as she was the royal Kumari, but this one was dedicated to all former Kumaris from different areas. There are 129 living Kumaris in all,” he added. Besides Kathmandu, Kumari tradition is followed in Bhaktapur, Lalitpur, and Kirtipur, among other cities.According to him, this was the first time an event like this was organised and the Deputy Mayor of Kathmandu, Sunita Dangol, was also in attendance.Throughout the year, many people line up outside the ‘Kumari Ghar’ to get a chance to visit the Kumari and get her blessings. Many foreigners stand out in the yard to catch a glimpse of her. Nepali people believe that if a Kumari smiles at you, it is a bad omen.Everyday, a tutor visits the Kumari to help her continue with her education as she is not allowed to step outside the Kumari Ghar. She takes her exams and does her homework from the Kumari Ghar itself. She also has the freedom to play inside the Kumari Ghar. Many former kumaris have pursued careers in their fields of interest or studied after their term ends, and they continue to be treated with the same respect. The tradition of Kumari has evolved over time. In the past Kumaris did not enjoy these freedoms.Because of various superstitious beliefs, Kumaris were not fully educated and were forbidden from getting married because of the belief that the groom would die soon if he married an ex-Kumari. They led secluded lives, were restricted from participating in normal childhood activities, and focused solely on their religious duties.However, now, these myths have been dispelled. Modern understanding has shifted to recognise that Kumaris, after stepping down from their divine role, have the freedom to marry and lead a normal life. The perception of Kumaris as isolated figures has evolved, with a focus on providing them with a more balanced upbringing. There have been initiatives to integrate Kumaris into regular social and educational settings, allowing them to have a more holistic and fulfilling childhood experience. “Matina was already familiar with the students from the school that she attended after her term as Kumari ended,” said Shakya. “The kids visited the Kumari Ghar frequently so that she could have a smooth transition,” he added. According to Gautam Prasad Shakya, who has been living as a caretaker in the Kumari Ghar, the changes made to the tradition are minor. “The traditions of Kumari have mostly stayed the same. All the rituals are still practised like in the old days,” he said.On 6 May 2005, Pun Devi Maharjan, a lawyer, filed a case in the Supreme Court claiming that the traditional practice of electing young girls as Kumaris, or “goddesses’, who are expected to follow certain social restrictions and appear at religious festivals, violated the rights of the child. Quoting Maharjan’s complaint, Puskar Mathema writes in Yuwamanch Monthly of October 2007, “If Kumari tradition is continued, it will undermine the fundamental rights as well the freedoms of children guaranteed by the constitution and child rights treaties. Apart from this, it will have a negative impact on their physical and mental development.”The case continued while Nepal overthrew the monarchy and declared itself a secular state in 2007. When the judgement was pronounced in 2008, the goddess was still in her role, now giving blessings to the country’s President. The court ordered that the Kumaris and ex-Kumaris receive better benefits and arrangements and ordered the government to improve their support and allowances.In April 2006, Prof Chunda Bajracharya filed a petition at the Supreme Court against Maharjan’s petition, who had argued against the Kumari tradition. Bajracharya contended that the tradition should be preserved as heritage due to its over 100 years of history.“People who don’t understand the culture shouldn’t comment on it,” she stated. Bajracharya also criticised the human right activists who contended that Kumaris were only allowed to wear the colour red. “People who say Kumaris are forced to wear red clothing all the time, are the same people who send their kids to schools in uniform,” she said.“After the 2008 court verdict, there have been a lot of improvements. Now, a teacher visits the Kumari Ghar daily to tutor the Kumari, who is expected to complete school assignments and sit periodic exams. All the former Kumaris now get benefits like scholarships and special pensions,” she added.Bajracharya is currently a professor of literature at the Tribhuvan University in Kathmandu.“The only significant change that the court verdict brought to the tradition was in terms of her education,” said Gautam Prasad Shakya, the caretaker. “Kumaris were tutored long before the case, but the case helped formalise this arrangement. After the court verdict, the time between 12 pm and 4 pm was designated as the Kumari’s tuition time,” he added.After the verdict, there was a concerted effort to provide Kumaris with access to quality education, enabling them to develop the skills and knowledge needed to lead fulfilling lives beyond their divine roles. There was also a shift towards ensuring that the Kumari's living quarters are comfortable, safe, and conducive to her overall well-being.Moreover, the selection process for the Kumari underwent reforms in the aftermath of the Pun Devi Maharjan case. There was a push for greater transparency, accountability, and inclusivity in the selection of the Kumari, with an emphasis on ensuring that the process was fair, respectful, and free from undue influence.Efforts were made to support their transition into adulthood, including providing them with comprehensive resources for education, vocation, and social integration. This shift aimed to address the challenges faced by former Kumaris and empower them to lead independent and fulfilling lives after their divine service.“The Kumari tradition has evolved over time. During the tenure of my daughter, we saw a lot of improvements. Even after her time as Kumari, Matina continued to get a lot of government support,” said Shakya, former Kumari Matina’s father.“Some people argue that child rights are being violated, but all of her rights are being upheld inside the Kumari Ghar. This is a unique and respected aspect of Nepali culture, and I don’t believe it violates any of my child’s rights.”While the Kumari tradition continues, its practices have evolved. “She enjoys this normal life and it didn’t take her long to adjust as well,” says Matina’s father, on her transition from the revered Kumari to the ordinary Matina. \nWhat animals did Juddha Shumsher have in his zoo?“We only have records of animals from the mid-1960s,” says Ganesh Koirala, who has been employed at the Central Zoo for the past 36 years and currently serves as its information officer and programme officer. “That too I hand-copied from an old torn-down file that I came across.”Today, the Central Zoo, which sprawls across six hectares in Jawalakhel, Lalitpur, houses as many as 1,298 wild animals of different species of mammals, reptiles, fishes and birds from Nepal and around the world—from tiger, rhinoceros, hippopotamus and red panda to its recent attraction: a pair of chimpanzees.After enduring decades of neglect under various government bodies, with its animals and infrastructure scraping along in a deplorable state, the zoo received a new lease of life with improved infrastructure and animal care in 1995, when it came under the management of the King Mahendra Trust for Nature Conservation (KMTNC), now known as the National Trust for Nature Conservation, in 1995.Today, the Central Zoo is an entertainment venue, one of the most happening places in the Kathmandu valley. Flocked by thousands of daily visitors, the zoo now also hosts rescued animals and those in need of rehabilitation. It is also a site for conservation education.But when Juddha Shumsher Rana (prime minister from 1932–1945) built the Jawalakhel Zoological Garden on the premises of his Jawalakhel Durbar (where Nepal Administrative Staff College stands today) in 1932, he did so purely for private interests—as a space of entertainment and amusement for him and his family.Built in the semi-wilderness of Jawalakhel around a historical pond dating to the 17th century during the reign of King Siddhi Narsingh Malla, the zoo also became the space he could use to show his respect for two women he revered, his mother and sister-in-law, and indulge in one of his favourite pastimes—gambling.Today, the Central Zoo, nestled in the heart of Jawalakhel's sprawling crowd, does not go unnoticed, and its story is well told. But what passions drove Juddha to build the zoo? What was its original layout? What animals did it have in the beginning? And how did Juddha spend time there?“I remember once seeing a small board that read ‘Jawalakhel Zoological Garden’,” Koirala says. “I don’t know whether it was from Juddha’s time or was made in the later years. It must surely be that Juddha built the zoo out of influence from the British given how this term was used by them.”Koirala adds, “There is a former employee, now an elderly gentleman who worked in the zoo in the 1960s. He surely has some stories from Juddha’s time.”Birds, beasts and palacesTo trace the birth of Jawalakhel Zoological Garden, one has to look at the history of Nepal’s rulers owning birds and animals.Like rulers around the world, Nepal’s royalty kept wild and exotic birds and animals in captivity as a source of pleasure and mark of wealth and power. The book ‘Social History of Nepal’ by historians TR Vaidya, Tri Ratna Manandhar and Shankar Lal Joshi details how Mallas during the mediaeval Kathmandu Valley to Ranas and Shahs in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries owned rare, exotic creatures. In 1708, a rhinoceros in Kathmandu Valley broke the iron chain in which it was bound and killed its tamer. In 1714, Bhaktapur’s King Bhupatindra Malla gifted a camel and an elephant to Kantipur’s King Bhaskar Malla to build peace.Among Shahs, King Rana Bahadur Shah in particular was reputed for his collection of birds and animals. He also owned a zoo outside his palace in Basantapur Durbar Square, where the Nepal Bank Limited stands in New Road today. The zoo contained “tiger, bear, monkey, elephant, horse, deer… heron, peacock… pigeon, wild dogs, rabbits, rats, mongoose.”Jung Bahadur Rana’s zoo on the premises of his Thapathali Durbar hosted a variety of birds and animals collected during his hunting expeditions as well as those brought from abroad. Jung Bahadur himself used to “supervise and inspect it”. Juddha Shumsher likewise had his own collection of creatures which steadily expanded into a zoological garden. Seeking wilderness in his Jawalakhel DurbarJuddha’s biographer Ishwari Prasad writes in ‘The Life and Times of Maharaja Juddha Shumsher Jung Bahadur Rana’ that between 1933 and 1940, Juddha shot 433 tigers, 33 rhinoceros and 93 leopards. An insatiable big-game hunter, Juddha had a deep fondness for being in the wild and among wild animals, and from this came, according to oral history prevalent among members of Kathmandu’s Rana community including Juddha’s descendants, the desire to own a zoo.Built in 1752, Schönbrunn Zoo in Vienna, the world’s first modern zoo, was already over 100 years old when Juddha was born in 1875. London Zoo opened in 1828 and Alipore Zoological Garden (Kolkata Zoo) in 1875. Nawab Wajid Ali Shah Zoological Garden (Lucknow Zoo) was established in 1921. Juddha’s inspiration, his descendants say, was most likely reinforced by his tours to zoological gardens during his visits to England in 1908 and to different Indian cities.An article titled ‘Central zoo in state of neglect’ published in The Kathmandu Post in 1996 says that Juddha one day “received a pair of leopards as a gift”, cementing his desire to own a zoo. A report ‘Central Zoo Master Plan’ prepared by the KMTNC in 1996 says that Juddha decided to build a zoo in an epiphany when he saw that some animals “including deer, a few rhinos, and some tigers had been collected from the Tarai and kept in Kathmandu” could be put into one compound in the “lonely piece of land with a large 16th [sic] century Malla period Pokhari”.The pond lay still and serene surrounded by green wilderness ever since Patan’s King Siddhi Narsingh Malla built it in the 1600s. On the grounds surrounding this pond, the Newars from Na:Tole, Pulchowk and surroundings had their devisthans where, for centuries, they gathered to perform their religious ceremonies during Basanta Panchami and Bhoto Jatra even after this area fell within the Jawalakhel Durbar.For the palace, the ground served as its extended garden along with a horse and elephant stable. Subodh Rana, 69, grandson of Juddha Shumsher, recalled his father Kiran Shumsher telling him that Juddha and his family sometimes also used the scenic grounds for picnics. If there was any spot where Juddha wanted to build a menagerie, it would be around this Pokhari (pond). One day, he called his grandson General Maheshwar Shumsher Rana and deputed him to the task of doing just this.The zoo’s layout—except for the small plots of lands acquired later—that was in place when it came under KMTNC's management was, the present and retired zoo officials believe, mostly the same as it was built by Maheshwar and so offers a peek into how Juddha’s zoo must have been like. Pond in the middle of the ground surrounded by enclosures—the southern bank housing mainly larger animals, and cages for birds positioned on the northern banks.From pigeons to the king of the jungleWhat animals and birds did the enclosures at Juddha’s zoo house?“We cannot tell for sure,” Koirala says.Once it came under government ownership, the zoo was tossed from one institution to the other for lack of interest and knowledge on the right institution to manage it. Amid all this chaos, documents were possibly lost and the zoo has no concrete record about the animals that Juddha must have once taken amusement at, said Koirala.Mukti Narayan Shrestha, 82, a retired secretary of the Nepal government, joined the Central Zoo in 1970 as a veterinarian when many original structures of the zoo were still intact. Shrestha also worked with an elderly khardar who, he says, was employed in the zoo since the time of Juddha and was about to retire when he joined.“In those days where the purpose of menageries was exclusively for exhibition and pleasure with no regard for the welfare and recreation of animals and birds, the cages were tiny and iron-barred,” Shrestha says.Elephant, horses, deer, monkeys, tiger, rhinoceros, clouded leopard, red panda, bear, palm civet (nir biralo), four-horned antelope, Himalayan goral, pheasants, Himalayan monal—from the mythical and the majestic, the gentle and friendly to the fiery and ferocious, Juddha’s zoo boasted them all, Shrestha says.Shrestha’s account is not different from the anecdotes passed down to other retired and present zoo officials and the members of the Rana community, who also detail the rare and the exotic fauna, like the gharial crocodile and porcupine, even the jungle’s king—creatures, they say, that Juddha must have received from foreigners as gifts—appearing alongside domestic birds like pigeons.Tidbits of published information also confirm that the zoo had a good collection of exotic birds and animals from Nepal and abroad. One such suggestion comes from Kalyan Shumsher’s ‘Shree Teen Juddha Mahima’ published during Juddha’s reign in 1943.“One need not travel abroad to see the incredible birds and animals found in foreign countries,” he writes. “It will suffice to see [those creatures] right here in the zoo opened by His Holiness Shree 3 [Juddha] in Jawalakhel.”Among these incredible creatures, one reigned supreme—lion, the king of the jungle.For one, it would not have satiated Juddha to build a zoo and not have the jungle’s king exhibited in it. Juddha hence must have done everything possible to ensure one for the zoo. Infrastructure at the zoo suggests that the lion indeed lived at Juddha’s zoo or, in the least, during the Rana regime.“Where bear habitat lies today, there were two dome-shaped attached enclosures with a holding room, constructed in the classic architecture that many enclosures in the British zoos had in the past. They had brick walls and lime plaster,” Koirala says. “These were built to house a lion in one cage and a tiger in the other.”Near these enclosures stood another cage that remains intact today, with the head of a roaring lion carved out of the wall on the top of its iron bars. Zoo officials as well as members of the Rana community believe that Juddha had this exhibit built to specifically house a lion.Remarkably, these Juddha-era infrastructural spaces are corroborated by a rare piece of photographic evidence. A 1946 photo of the zoo shows a lion while a Kathmandu mother and her sons stand in front of its cage.Juddha’s place of piety and playThe zoo was not merely a space that Juddha sought out for amusement and retreat in the outpost of his palace; he also used this place to express his deepest affection.This affection spills right at the zoo’s entrance, in the form of the life-size statue of Karma Kumari Devi, wife of Juddha’s elder brother and Rana Prime Minister Dev Shumsher. Karma Kumari stands tall in her regal costume shaded by a wide canopy. Juddha revered Karma Kumari because it was she who raised him and looked after his mother Juhar Kumari Devi after the death of his father Dhir Shumsher. On another prominent part of the zoo on the south-east, Juhar Kumari’s enthroned statue overlooks the pond. Juddha had commissioned the London-based sculptor Domenico Antonio Tonelli to cast these statues.When Karma Kumari’s statue was unveiled is not clear, but Juhar Kumari’s statue was unveiled by Juddha amid a grand function in 1935 on Jawalakhel’s most auspicious day, Bhoto Jatra. It was attended by the British Resident Frederick Bailey.“On June 28, 1935, at Jawalakhel Durbar… the pond nearby looked very scenic,” says a Gorkhapatra news report titled ‘Statue installation’ dated July 5, 1935. “Because it was the day of Bhoto Jatra of Machhindranath… and moreover since an ideal woman’s statue was being unveiled, there was a crowd of lakhs of people.”Less than fifty metres from Karma Kumari’s statue stands a one-story building with a pagoda roof that today serves as the zoo’s meeting hall. Juddha, an avid gambler, found the scenic semi-wilderness covered in trees and filled with the sounds of wildlife to be a perfect place to relish the game. So he built a building with twelve doors on its four sides allowing him and his fellow gambling compatriots the freedom to enter through a particular door that they thought would bring luck. He called it his Juwa Ghar, the gambling house, and built it with the sole purpose of indulging in the game he loved. Roar of lion reverberates in KathmanduThe sounds of the animals and birds in the zoo rose up in the Jawalakhel sky. Every day, until much later in the 1970s, roar of the zoo’s lion (there were later other lions) diffused to far corners of the Valley, merging the zoo with the spirit of Kathmandu and informing the city folks of its presence.But was the zoo open to the public as well?“I think once it was built, the zoo was open for the public,” Subodh Rana said. “It is unlikely that Juddha Shumsher built such a large zoo and kept it only for his family.”For one, Kalyan Shumsher mentioning that one “need not travel abroad to see the incredible birds and animals found in foreign countries” suggests that the public had at least some access to the zoo. Of course, the Newar community from Na:Tole, Pulchowk and surrounding areas were permitted inside the zoo on the days of their guthi functions on Basanta Panchami and Bhoto Jatra.As the zoo was established at the back of the ground where Bhoto Jatra celebrations happen, it naturally filled with revellers on this day in addition to the guthi ritual observers as testified by the Gorkhapatra report. The photo of the mother and her sons also bear testimony that the zoo was not entirely closed to the public.What is widely believed, though, is that the zoo officially came under government ownership after Nepal became a democracy in 1951. And it would still be a few more years before it was open to the public in 1956.In 1945, Juddha gave up his power and eventually retired in Dehradun, India, where he died in 1952. With time, Jawalakhel Zoological Garden became the Central Zoo. It would take many avatars—a neglected site of crammed, unmaintained cages with sad eyes of emaciated creatures staring from behind the bars, a focal point of animal diplomacy, particularly during the period of monarchy, to, in its recent decades, a space of conservation and education.When all this was happening, the city sprawled around Jawalakhel, subduing the lion’s roar with its noise. More wildlife from around the country and the world came—creatures captured from the wild, those sold by circuses, those rescued from traffickers. Fate would bring these creatures to the care of generations of Kathmandu folks, intertwining each other’s joys and sorrows. After the tale of Juddha’s Jawalakhel Zoological Garden, there would be these stories to tell. Sitting around a table inside Juddha’s Juwa Ghar, Koirala and other zoo officials begin unfolding these stories before me. \nArtificial intelligence is the product of an unbounded craving for automation. Since the beginning of human civilisation, we have been inventing new machines and technologies to reduce our physical and mental efforts to accomplish tasks. The fascination with automatic intelligent thinking machines that can function as human brains have shaped the narratives of different eras of human history, coloured the imagination of scientists of different epochs and constructed the plots of science fiction. According to reports, those scientists and philosophers who described the process of human thinking as the mechanical manipulation of symbols were the first to plant the seeds of AI. The invention of programmable digital computers in the 1940s and the use of mathematical reasoning in their functioning made some scientists hopeful towards building electronic brains. For this purpose, AI research was founded at a workshop held at Dartmouth College in 1956, where John McCarthy, an American computer scientist and cognitive scientist, introduced the term “artificial intelligence”.After countless experiments and many failures, scientists have created several forms of AI for different objectives. However, the advancement of large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT in writing or composition has ignited widespread debate over their legitimacy, morality and suitability. Since its inception on November 30, 2022, ChatGPT’s use has drawn the attention of many theorists and scholars of writing pedagogy as it is now regarded as a thinking machine that can generate human-like texts. This intelligent machine can change traditional pedagogical practices by transforming the writing process, including students’ approach towards writing assignments. Some theorists think that these tools can negatively affect the writing process, while others believe that they can be used as reliable tools to move to different stages of the writing process. Positive uses of AI These days, student writers have access to various AI tools with diverse functions that help them go through different stages of the writing process. Grammarly is an editing tool that checks grammar, spelling, punctuation and style and gives required suggestions for further improvements. Quillbot can be used for paraphrasing; Snazzy AI for content creation; Sribbr Plagiarism Checker for detecting intellectual theft and ensuring originality. Among these tools, ChatGPT is regarded as the smartest and most powerful electronic thinking brain due to its ability to navigate corpus texts and produce human-like texts. Undoubtedly, AI’s prudent and creative application can assist student writers in the writing process, to which even pundits of composition pedagogy agree. For example, Generative AI manipulates the process of machine learning to generate results from the existing online corpus data by detecting recurring patterns. Gen AIs like ChatGPT can instantly work on user prompts and create desired texts. Even in academic settings, the likelihood of using diverse writing-related AI tools by students cannot be denied. This means that the future of writing or composition will be shaped by the invasion of AIs into these territories. So, we must use AIs creatively, honestly and wisely in education to maintain academic aura and integrity. This can bring opportunities for positive changes in education, particularly in teachers’ and students’ academic performance in writing and other activities. Negative impacts Despite the merits of AI in the writing process, they are not without flaws. The latest version of ChatGPT, which has become more powerful and creative in generating diverse texts, has made compositionists anxious about its consequences. They believe such tools may cause adverse effects on the overall writing process. They have detected serious flaws in AI-generated writing and are also concerned about the future of teaching writing and the possible misuse of AI by student writers. Opponents of AI have pointed out some drawbacks to the unrestricted and unchecked use of writing tools. First, AI tools lack the human creativity or cognition to differentiate bad content from good ones. There are also issues pertinent to the violation of copyright and plagiarism in writing. Moreover, large language models have been encoded in linguistic patterns of the so-called dominant language, English, which may give birth to a new form of colonialism and undermine the spirit of social justice for which minorities have been fighting for generations. The concept of linguistic inclusiveness in composition pedagogy and translanguaging (how bilinguals and multilinguals utilise their language skills to understand and engage with their environment) will likely be affected. Additionally, AI lacks humans’ crystallised intelligence/knowledge, contextual understanding and syntactical innovation and cannot be involved in meaning-making. Furthermore, AI cannot detect biases and discriminatory content found in their source data. AI-generated texts can cross all the boundaries of propriety, linguistic justice and social inclusiveness by creating unreadable and unacceptable texts. These contents are also just imitations, which can be repetitive and factually incorrect. In short, AI cannot work independently in expected ways. Human intervention and creativity are required to check them constantly. To bridge the divided perspectives and achieve a balance, student writers need to mitigate the negative aspects of AI-generated texts to save their composition, ingenuity and authenticity. They should use these tools as one relies on co-authors to assist with pre-and post-writing activities such as idea generation, editing and proofreading. Students should understand that depending entirely on AI will not be beneficial in the long run. After all, these tools aren’t independent thinkers and cannot replace our originality and empirical knowledge. \nAfter more than seven decades of independence, Indian politics finds itself at a crossroads, grappling with complex issues that challenge its foundational ideals. While it may be misleading to draw direct parallels with neighbouring Bangladesh, the invocation of Dr BR Ambedkar the iconic architect of the Indian Constitution into contemporary debates as recently happened in the Upper House of Parliament highlights a significant conundrum.This reference reflects not only our un-statesmanlike attitude but also our uncharitable attitude towards a stalwart who championed the rights of the underprivileged during an era when nationalist politics largely marginalised him. Even today, discussions surrounding the thinker qua activist Bhimrao Ramji Ambedkar evoke multiple discourses, positioning him in a metaphorical rehearsal room of history, awaiting an authentic assessment by future generations. His legacy serves as both a reminder and a challenge to current political narratives, urging us to confront the undue turns that politics takes for its own benefits. In reflecting on Professor Khilnani’s profound observation that Indian history is often portrayed as a “curiously unpeopled place”, we are morally bound to consider the essential contributions of its founding fathers.The question arises—can we envision India without acknowledging figures such as Kabir, Phule, Birsa Munda, Periyar, and Ambedkar? These individuals form the bedrock of the Indian Constitution and embody the multicultural essence of our society. Their legacies are steeped in a relentless struggle for justice and equality, which resonates through an immeasurable saga of sacrifice. Therefore, modern India cannot be understood solely through the glossy lenses of Yoga, discussions in well decorated seminar rooms on the ‘civilisation state’, or grand narratives of economic growth.Instead, it is crucial to recognise how the enduring thoughts and philosophies of these thinkers awakened the dormant masses from antiquity and shaped the identity of today’s Indian republic. Today, when we examine India, it is clear that its path to freedom was not a sudden midnight epiphany but rather a gradual evolution shaped by influential figures like Ambedkar. His contributions are inseparable from the annals of modern Indian history, as he dedicated his life to navigating the country towards radical experiments in social justice. Ambedkar’s polemics resonate with those of critical thinkers in that it boldly posed volleys of perturbing questions and thus challenged the entrenched system of caste/cultural hegemony, positioning himself against the mainstream currents of Indian nationalism.His efforts laid the groundwork for a more equitable society, highlighting the complexities and struggles inherent in India’s perennial quest for true freedom. The Indian state’s political actions, often driven by elite centralisation, clash with Ambedkar’s ideals, which diverge significantly from the narratives of major political entities like the Congress Party or current majoritarian frameworks. Ambedkar embodies a challenge to these dominant discourses, advocating for true democracy and genuine welfare for marginalised groups, including Adivasis. In contrast, the prevailing political logic tends to accommodate these communities not out of a benign commitment to democratic principles but rather as a means to construct a cohesive national entity capable of generating economic surplus. This approach prioritises the construction of political stability to strengthen the state over authentic democratic engagement and inclusivity in India’s diverse multicultural landscape. Even today, it appears that the elites are making concerted efforts to promote new discourses aimed at unifying India, particularly at a time when achieving a cohesive national identity seems increasingly challenging. The political landscape is heavily influenced by the narrative of “one nation, one election,” which seeks to streamline governance and enhance national unity. However, this push for a singular identity must be viewed through the lens of India’s multicultural society, which complicates the realisation of such a grand elitist vision.In this context, it is essential to critically examine and reflect on the cultural dimensions of our diverse populace. Many regions and sections experience psychological unease regarding the overarching project of transforming various social groups into a modern citizenry that would be loyal and acquiescent to the state. This necessitates a deeper understanding of how identity symbolism interacts with the lived realities of different communities across India. Thus, we understand that Ambedkar is no longer merely a protestant icon against the scourge of untouchability; today, his spirit gets amplified and becomes the pivotal embodiment as the key ideologue of social justice. His thought serves as a formidable barrier against the evolving challenges posed by the Indian state, particularly its attempts to undermine accountability amidst a crisis-ridden capitalism that threatens to stifle substantive democracy.This situation risks rendering the state increasingly authoritarian in a Hegelian sense. Consequently, any reference to Ambedkar must be approached with sensitivity, or else a murky climate of thought or similar veiled attempts might ultimately be self-defeating, if not condescending to India’s vast multitude of unequal citizens, hence undemocratic and unparliamentary.-The Statesman (India) / ANN \nOn December 19, 2024, the veteran communist leader and upper-house parliamentarian Bamdev Gautam caused quite a stir in the Dalit community by suggesting that the word ‘Dalit’ must be removed from official documents, including the constitution and the law. He made a fallacious argument that removing the word Dalit from all written documents would somehow emancipate that community and guarantee their rights.Speaking to the National Assembly’s Development, Economic Affairs and Good Governance, Gautam said, “Let’s remove the term Dalit from our dictionary… On the one hand, we decry discrimination against Dalits and the infringement of their rights; but on the other, our language, acts, constitution, law as well as document written by the scholars all refer to them as Dalits.” No doubt, Dalit has become a controversial term over the years, even within the Dalit community. Social media is full of comments from ordinary people, most of whom are upper castes, where the word is presented as a kind of license to dominate and discriminate against the “untouchables”. And, strangely, some Dalits themselves tend to agree! Especially the younger generation of Dalits, particularly those from the towns and with some opportunities and privileges, harbour a degree of disgust with the word. They think Dalit identity, Dalit quotas and Dalit literature have further exposed them to discrimination. There’s some truth in that, of course, but it’s a mistaken understanding.But this is the first time a senior communist politician—a former deputy prime minister and home minister—has expressed his anger at the Dalit word. How do we understand this attitude of a senior politician towards us? What does he want by attacking Dalit identity, one wonders: True liberation of Dalits or the end of their limited access to power and privilege?A nonsensical argumentGautam’s assertion on removing the word Dalit from legal and official documents and literature apparently for their own sake doesn’t make any sense. There’s no evidence to suggest that simply getting rid of a word automatically liberates the community from traditional oppression. There’s the glaring case of India. The Dalits of this country started using the term Dalit as their self-identification centuries ago. However, the Constitution of independent India, passed by the Constituent Assembly on November 29, 1949, doesn’t refer to any caste or community as a “Dalit”. The untouchables have been constitutionally and legally identified as the “scheduled caste” instead.A question to respected Gautam is: Has the avoidance of the term Dalit from the official lingo in India really contributed to the emancipation of Dalits? Has this policy really stopped the practice of untouchability in society? The answer is, squarely, no!In contrast, the usage of the term Dalit in Nepal is quite recent. The political movements of the “untouchables”, often supported by the Nepali Congress Party and the communist parties, borrowed it from India and started using it in their movements only seven decades ago. But we’ve been subjugated, exploited, separated and humiliated as “untouchables”, following Hindu laws, from centuries ago, well before the unification of Nepal by Prithvi Narayan Shah in the mid-18th century. It’s important to keep in mind, therefore, that the significant section of the Nepali population currently recognised as Dalits have been suppressed and tormented, including through state laws and policies (such as the Muluki Ain of 1854), since long before the use of the term came into use. Is it fair then to lay the entire blame of Dalit suffering on what I would consider an innocent word?Change culture, not literature Nobody would suggest that one word or one form of identity should be established forever. Healthy debates and discussions on any identification must be welcomed and encouraged. It’s a good idea to change communal identity befitting the changing times. But this should happen amongst the concerned groups themselves; upper-caste leaders like Gautam must not intervene.But many of us hold that this is not the time to argue against using the term Dalit. For one thing, unlike humiliating terms like untouchable and water-unusable and low caste and small caste, Dalit identity wasn’t forced upon us by the state or the religion. The state started using this term, instead of the other highly stigmatised terms mentioned above, according to our own needs and demands. Moreover, it’s crazy to think that simply removing the word would remove the stigma of caste and minimise caste hatred against us. It’s not that simple, is it? In this futile exercise, various Dalit groups have adopted new surnames including some resembling the prestigious upper-caste surnames. The Kami and Damai each has more than two hundred family names! A fake family name would provide a degree of cover against caste prejudice in unfamiliar social settings—but that doesn’t, and hasn’t, in any way, liberated anybody from the traditional forms of exclusion and humiliation. We recently met with former prime minister and Maoist chair Pushpa Kamal Dahal “Prachanda”, who agreed with our assertion that political changes alone haven’t changed the situation of Dalits on the ground. What is truly required is a separate “cultural revolution” against the caste system. I’ve heard some other senior politicians from across the party spectrum express a similar sentiment. Neither Dahal nor we meant here the cultural revolution conducted by Chairman Mao in China in 1967-76. I’ve long advocated the need for religious and cultural reforms to tackle the entrenched problem of caste discrimination in this country. The key to our success. People often frown at our assertion to conduct religious reform, maintaining that it’s impossible to amend Brahmanism. True, religious texts like Manusmriti can’t be reviewed as easily as a constitution or law. But that doesn’t mean religious traditions and beliefs can’t be corrected according to changing times. Our society has undergone many religious and cultural reforms in recent years. Upper castes no longer require ritual purification after returning from sea voyages. Intercaste marriage is quite common and acceptable, among non-Dalits in particular. Today’s Bahuns are free to drink alcohol, eat with other castes, play drums, run iron workshops and tailoring shops. Society has been far more rigid when it comes to reforming the religion and culture to guarantee the constitutional and legal rights of Dalits. That’s the last push we must all attempt. Despite the strong inertia, the state can reform religious and cultural beliefs and practices, with the aid of modern laws. Dalit freedom fighters must pressure the ruling class to work in that direction. We all want to break the chain of Dalitness. We have no pride in being born a Dalit. It’s an identity that should be dumped in the dustbin of history. But we will only become free from Dalit identity when the rituals and customs get rid of the practice of untouchability.  \nNepal is ahead of many countries in LGBTQIA+ rights and policies. The Constitution of Nepal recognises gender and sexual minorities, which even developed countries like the US don’t explicitly mention. Moreover, the judiciary’s support for the rights of the queer community has increased in recent years. While these achievements seem noteworthy at the outset, there is still a huge disparity between the laws and the reality queer people face every day. In Nepal, while much of the activism for the rights of the LGBTQIA+ community still focuses on something as basic as identity and legal recognition, issues like the sexual and reproductive health rights (SRHR) of these communities remain overlooked. Although the Constitution of Nepal ensures fundamental rights, such as reproductive rights under the Safe Motherhood and Reproductive Health Act (2018) for gender and sexual minorities, these provisions haven’t effectively catered to the sexual and reproductive health of these communities.The discrimination and stigma that gender and sexual minorities face daily manifests in their general inaccessibility of fundamental rights in Nepal. Programmes related to SRHR are usually associated with cisgender women and ignore LGBTQIA+ individuals. Queer folks are judged and ridiculed not just by their family members but also by the health staff at hospitals and health posts. This is problematic in a country where transgender people are forced to undergo surgery for medical verification to be legally recognised as “male” or “female”. Gender-affirming surgery requires medical professionals to follow certain clinical protocols; however, the existing law does not address gender reassignment. In August, the Supreme Court made landmark progress in recognising LGBTQIA+ rights by ruling that Rukshana Kapali, a transgender woman, must be legally recognised as a woman on all documents without requiring medical verification; however, the law for legal recognition remains the same for all. So, these individuals have no option but to travel to India for surgeries, which can be expensive and unsafe. Moreover, transgender men, lesbians and bisexual individuals often struggle to access basic menstrual hygiene products and healthcare facilities related to safe motherhood and abortion. The path to having and parenting children is fraught with difficulties for queer individuals, as IVF and adoption facilities aren’t accessible. While surrogacy is legal for infertile married Nepali couples, it is prohibited for singles, transgender couples and foreign nationals.Many people have the misconception that only cisgender women menstruate, but anyone with a uterus can experience it. These narratives arise through the limited awareness of our society and restrictive school curriculums. Such a perpetuation of false ideas further influences dominant ideas in popular platforms. Rarely do we see people from the LGBTQIA+ communities in the advertisements of sanitary pads or contraceptives. These communities often receive attention only during Pride Month (June), but progress in SRHR and other issues requires ongoing efforts, not just a month of focus.The legal recognition of same-sex marriage between Surendra Pandey and Maya Gurung in 2023 made many hopeful about the future of Nepal’s LGBTQIA+ individuals. Conversations about the potential of Nepal’s LGBTQIA+ tourism (rainbow tourism) have emerged since. To ensure its sustainability, we must prioritise fundamentals such as SRHR for the queer communities to create a safe space for them. For our economy to benefit from their participation, it must ensure that their primary needs are met with dignity.Our leaders cannot dismiss the issues of queer people by relying on the superficial claims of LGBTQIA+ policy advancements. Yes, there has been progress, but it is not enough. Lawmakers must understand that queer rights go beyond sexuality and identity and include all aspects of human rights, such as the right to sexual and reproductive health. Laws can only go so far if we do not change our deeply rooted beliefs and accept people for who they are while providing essential services. \nNepal’s dairy sector has for long been under financial strain. The cost of milk and milk products has spiked so much that many households have cut down on (or entirely stopped) their consumption. The price of processed milk, which was Rs76 a litre in January 2022, has climbed up to Rs120 a litre. Dairy products from Uttar Pradesh of India that are comparatively cheaper (INR62 or Rs100 a litre) are also smuggled into the country. As a result of reduced demand and steady imports of cheap products, the state-owned Dairy Development Corporation now has a stockpile of 600 tonnes of butter and 500 tonnes of powdered milk, and the farmers are yet to get Rs580 million the cash-strapped DDC owes them. Farmers, dismayed by the delays in payment, have often had to take to the streets.In an effort to settle the problem, the DDC has started exploring domestic private as well as international markets. To start with, it has agreed to supply 1,000 kg of raw cheese or whey (used to make chhurpi which is also called hard cheese) to a private company daily, starting December 30. The DDC will need 10,000 litres of milk a day to do so. The company, Himalayan Dog Chew, owned by the Manaram Group, exports chhurpi to the United States. Known as dog chew in the West, chhurpi is quite popular and in high demand among the owners of pooches in the US and Canada. But exporters in Nepal have struggled to meet the demand. So the deal between the private company and the DDC couldn’t have come at a better time. The dairy corporation has, for the first time, collaborated with the private sector to sell its products. But there’s still a lot of work to be done. As reported in Kantipur, the Post’s sister publication, eastern Nepal has a huge potential to export hard cheese, and some small dairy firms and farmers, with their own efforts, are selling these products in India without branding them. If Nepal could brand them and strike multiple such partnerships with more private companies in the countries in its immediate neighborhood, it could be to the benefit of both the DDC and the dairy farmers. Exporting milk products with the help of the private sector could bring relief to the farmers and the broader dairy industry. However, the success of this initiative is contingent on strong coordination between private companies and farmers. To facilitate this, the dairy corporation should establish a clear mechanism to get the milk from the farmers, who are at the start of the supply chain, to the exporters, who are at the end. There should also be a lot more coordination. For instance, while the demand for chhurpi is healthy, the butter that emerges during dog chew production doesn’t get the market. As the DDC is also planning to export butter to Tibet and to the larger Chinese markets, establishing a seamless channel of trade and communication between the farmers, the DDC and the private buyers would be vital. If China agrees to Nepal’s export proposal, experts say that the DDC’s products will not stockpile. With a little more thought put into the process, it could be a win-win prospect for all three sides.   \nThe Maoist party, which joined mainstream politics by signing the Comprehensive Peace Agreement in 2006, has always had a peculiar relation with semantics. In the insurgency days, the top Maoist leaders were not known by their real names but their noms de guerre. Partly, this was done to hide their identity, and partly, it was their way of overcoming individualism and pursuing a larger cause. Thus Pushpa Kamal Dahal became ‘Prachanda’, Baburam Bhattarai ‘Laldhoj’, Barsha Man Pun ‘Ananta’ and so on. The party has itself undergone various name changes to arrive at its current avatar of CPN (Maoist Centre). There are often rumours of the party leaders mulling removing the ‘Maoist’ tag. Despite this seeming flexibility, it must hurt all those involved in the decade-long war when the country’s top court repeatedly rejects their attempts to recognise the janayuddha (‘people’s war’). Most recently, the apex court ruled that it is unconstitutional to use the term in official documents. A year ago, it had rejected the-then Maoist-led government’s efforts to declare a public holiday on ‘People’s War Day’. With their strongest claim to political space—a self-sacrificing war waged for the benefit of the downtrodden and the marginalised communities—legally rejected, the use of violence that took nearly 17,000 lives, and left countless more disabled and ‘disappeared’, will be questioned even more in the days ahead. The Maoists and a section of the intelligentsia continue to talk up the war’s achievements: There would apparently have been no republican federal state without the war. Or a system of reservations for the marginalised communities. (Even this newspaper acknowledges the Maoist role in these developments.) Yet it is as important to factor in the party’s evolution in the post-war years. The causes that the party once held dear—particularly issues of the poorest and most marginalized sections of the society—have repeatedly been sacrificed at the altars of Dahal’s naked quest for power. These days, there is little to choose between the Maoist Centre and the old ‘bourgeois’ parties in the Nepali Congress and the CPN-UML that the former rebels once held responsible for all social ills. Times are also changing. Those born in the past three decades have little or no memory of the war. Instead, they have seen how its supposed achievements have been endlessly abused by leaders from across the political spectrum. For these younger folks, the idea of getting political legitimacy through a war waged in the name of Mao—a bloodthirsty dictator from another time and place—just does not sound right. Of late, the CPN (Maoist Centre) party has been making much of its ‘stellar’ showing in the recent bypolls. This, say party leaders, is an indication that their popularity is again on the up. That is unlikely. These small pockets of electoral success aside, indications are that people are highly dissatisfied by the functioning of the Maoist party as well as its chair Dahal. The loss in support among its once core constituencies is particularly alarming. Unless the Maoist leadership is ready to internalise and acknowledge how it has let these constituencies down and to commit to rectifying its mistakes, an electoral comeback looks tough. Unfortunately, for Dahal and his followers, there is no going back to the old-school janayuddha either.   \nThe CPN (Unified Socialist) was formed in August 2021 by a group of dissident CPN-UML leaders including two former party chiefs and ex-prime ministers—Madhav Kumar Nepal and Jhala Nath Khanal. The party, which has 10 seats in the federal lower house is struggling with organisation building, re-elected Nepal as party chief in July. The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal sat down with Chairman Nepal to hear his assessment of the new party’s three years and his future plans for it.How do you review the first three years of your party?First, we have to start with the question of if the formation of this party was necessary. We made the absolutely right move by revolting [against the CPN-UML leadership’s actions]. We foiled the attempts to trample on the constitution and stopped the autocratic, regressive, rightist and individualistic tendencies from prevailing in Nepali politics. Our moves have been politically, legally as well as constitutionally justified, with even the Supreme Court validating them. After that, we displaced the then [KP Sharma Oli-led] government, and brought national politics on the right track. We then formed this party. Politics doesn’t always go in a straight line. In politics, you face ups and downs, twists and turns and sometimes turbulence. Those who are powerful today could become weak and may disappear over time. Weaker forces may get stronger. Some of our friends say, “Our revolt was right but joining the coalition was wrong”. But it was the need of the time. It is true that we committed some mistakes and couldn’t get enough proportional representation (PR) votes in federal and provincial polls in 2022. We were unnecessarily flexible while making seat allocations with other coalition partners in a number of constituencies. We also strongly opposed the proposals of coalition partners in certain constituencies and fought on our own strength and won seats. For instance, the CPN (Maoist Centre) didn’t cooperate with us in my own constituency in Rautahat. They didn’t vote for us. But I still won. We fought elections in some palikas [local units] on our own and won majority seats there. But in certain areas our local leaders couldn’t properly negotiate with other partners. Now we should neither be over-reliant on the election coalitions nor do we need to criticise it. Others will recognise us only if we increase our strength. We have had mixed experiences in the past three years. We should be encouraged and optimistic about the future.But our observation from outside is that your party failed in the elections. It couldn’t even secure national party status and you have done poorly on the organisation front as well. The situation would be drastically different had all the friends who were initially with us remained active with firm commitment. Some friends lost confidence. Therefore, we couldn’t perform as per the expectations. But our party has produced exemplary results in Madhes Province. We were doing well in Rautahat district even until the latest by-polls. My activeness has never diminished and I have left no stone unturned in terms of inspiring other leaders. But everyone should actively work to build a party. Some people talk big but don’t take responsibility.You touched on what went wrong in terms of securing PR votes. Could you elaborate?Our situation would be much better had we fielded more candidates, at least in provincial seats. Our party chapters and members would have been more active in the constituencies if our candidates were in the field. The Janata Samajbadi Party Nepal made a smart move in this connection. The JSP fielded more candidates for provincial seats. From the start, JSP leaders used to wonder in coalition meetings about how they would get PR votes if their candidates aren’t in the constituencies. As our party members joined the campaigns for common candidates of the coalition, they couldn’t ask for votes in our party’s election symbol ‘pen’ in the PR category. Had we mobilised separate teams to campaign for the PR votes, we could have easily crossed the threshold for PR seats in the House of Representatives. Don’t you think the party is top-heavy with senior leaders while failing to attract new faces?We have no dearth of leaders or cadres. But we have a problem in mobilising them. In our party, the monitoring and evaluation system is weak. You can’t make one answerable unless you have an evaluation system in writing. Therefore, this time we have assigned responsibilities for just a year. Now they have to submit periodic reports of activities in their respective committees. We became too lenient and didn’t punish those who didn’t work. You led a huge organisation in the UML for one-and-half decades. But you appear to be struggling to fix issues in this relatively small organisation.See, people are becoming more selfish, self-centered and lazy. So, we have to make our evaluation system strong. As we have a strong organisation and the right ideology and values, we should now launch pro-people movements and connect with the public.Do you think the party failed to attract and mobilise people due to its continuous engagement in the government since formation and lack of attractive agenda?We don’t lack agendas. We have identified and enlisted many issues directly linked to the people’s livelihood in our political paper. We failed to reach the doorsteps of the people. For instance, if there is violence against a woman, our women chapter should immediately reach there. Likewise, the student wing should actively work for the rights of students. Some of our friends say we shouldn’t have stood in favour of endorsement of the MCC [Millennium Challenge Corporation’s compact]. They argued it was being implemented to encircle our neighbour China and establish a military base in our country. We suspected the same. But our country had already signed on to that. Different interpretations of the concept related to the project emerged. Some described it as a part of the Indo-Pacific Strategy. When we studied the matter, we found CPN-UML chair KP Oli was all set to endorse the compact without any changes in the text, bypassing us. Oli put forward five conditions for that before then prime minister Sher Bahadur Deuba. The conditions included impeaching Speaker Agni Sapkota for not taking action against us [UML had demanded that the Speaker strip 14 lawmakers who quit UML to form the new party of their positions], scrapping our party’s registration in the Election Commission and removing us from the coalition. But Deuba ji stood against that. Then, we found a middle way, which was to endorse the compact with a 12-point explanatory note. So that was the right decision. The government earlier this month signed the framework for the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) cooperation agreement with China. What is your view on this?It is natural to take it [BRI] forward as we have implemented the MCC of the US and have joined hands with other countries and multilateral agencies to carry out our development activities. The projects to be built under the BRI have no strategic or military connections and are based on mutual benefit. So there is no need to be suspicious and we have to focus on how to take maximum benefits from projects under the BRI.Just a few days ago, you met and talked to Bamdev Gautam, who appears ready to join your party. What is the progress on this?He has said he is ready to join and accept our party’s decisions. We are discussing this. He has played an important role in critical political junctures. He strongly supported me during the second People’s Movement in 2006. A political party needs such leaders. We are thinking of concluding this process [of welcoming him] soon.What about Bhim Rawal joining the party?Unhappy with the party leadership, he has been inactive in the UML but he has not made up his mind to join our party.Is finalising Gautam’s hierarchy and role in the party taking time?There won’t be an issue in the case of Bamdev ji. But overall, the number of leaders in our party is big. In the Chinese Communist Party, there are only seven members in the Politburo Standing Committee and 17 members in Other Politburo Members. But there are 24 members in our party’s central secretariat, 41 in the standing committee and 108 members in the politburo. Those who get a candidacy in the election celebrate but those who don’t get a ticket become inactive. Some others fight for ministerial posts. Yet others complain about not getting a ‘lucrative’ ministry. We have to manage them all.What about reunifying the party with the UML or the Maoist Centre? Many say leaders are more comfortable with the Maoist Centre but party cadres are for rejoining the UML.Most of our cadres are from the UML background. That might have played a role. But at present there is no possibility of our reunification with the UML. Also, the situation isn’t right to forge unity with the Maoist Centre.It is said that there is pressure from party members for reunification with the UML?That’s not true. There is a negative view about us in the UML and therefore our party rank and file wouldn’t be ready to surrender. Some might be lobbying for entry into the UML for personal benefits. Even if some join the UML, it won’t be easy for them there.But some noted leaders such as Ram Kumari Jhakri who had strongly supported you in the course of building this party have said that the Unified Socialist can’t run like this and that it is better to merge with the UML?I also enquired about her remarks but she said her intent had been misunderstood. But I repeat that there is no possibility of unity with the UML. We studied the possibility of unity with the Maoist Centre but concluded that we can’t accept Maoism and we also found their election symbol inappropriate. So the process has stopped. For now, we will concentrate on strengthening our own party.How is the Unified Socialist different from the UML?Our’s is a policy-driven party and not leader-centric. Committee system prevails in our organisation, not the leader’s orders. We discard rightist approaches and follow revolutionary ideas. We don’t see these qualities in the UML. Only our party has a policy of ‘Socialism with Nepali Characteristics’. We prioritise our agenda based on justice, fair distribution, production and good governance. There was a period when socialism stressed only on equality and therefore some termed it a distribution of poverty but we believe socialism as a principle of prosperity. Capitalism focuses only on profits even at the cost of people’s lives and wars but socialism values people’s lives and livelihoods. So, we are clearly against capitalism and in favour of socialism. But there are different forms of capitalism. We are for promoting national capitalism and eliminating comprador capitalists. We need to invite and welcome foreign investment to increase production in the country.Your party held its general convention in July first week and it took months to elect other office bearers and assign roles and responsibilities. Why?It shouldn’t have happened. Some wrong elements entered our party. Some showed immaturity by raising the issue of ‘new generation’. That spoiled the situation. Building a party is not easy. It calls for many things including ideological clarity, capacity to lead the organisation efficiently and an accepted personality. We have to learn from this episode and remove the mistrust that cropped up in this course. \nIt has been five months since the Nepali Congress and the CPN-UML formed a coalition government on July 15 by stepping on the seven-point deal inked on July 1. How is the coalition of the two biggest political parties faring? The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal sat down with Krishna Khanal, a professor of political science, for his insights.How do you evaluate the performance of the Congress-UML government based on the pledges they made at the time of coalition formation?Two biggest parties getting together to form a government is a bit unusual in the system we have adopted. The strength of the system is that the government can be made accountable by a strong opposition. But when the two biggest parties join hands to run the government, the opposition in the House becomes weak. This is a concern. The Congress and the UML have had joint governments in critical junctures in the past. Now, there is no extraordinary situation requiring them to forge a coalition but they justified it saying it would end political instability. Their argument was that unreasonable bargaining of smaller parties made the prime ministers weak. That’s partially true. However, the crux of the matter is that they wanted to enjoy consolidated power. KP Oli wanted to be prime minister and the Congress leaders who were out of power wanted to return to Singha Durbar. So they signed the seven-point deal with the pledge of amending the constitution.Has this coalition been a success? What are the initial indications?There are certain curious things. The seven-point agreement doesn’t say the UML will hand over government leadership to the Congress in the second phase of their partnership. It says, after two years, UML chair Oli will hand it over to Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba. It shows how our parties have become leader-centric instead of institution-centric. After all, Oli and Deuba are the chiefs and parliamentary leaders of their respective parties and they are the ones who will lead the government. Still they wished to specifically mention their names, which indicates they still feel insecure. Likewise, Prime Minister Oli says that he is handing over power to Deuba in July 2026. Recently he said he is handing it over after 18 months. Despite there being a written agreement, he keeps repeating the timeline. This suggests mutual mistrust due to past records of betrayal. It is true that the Congress and the UML together have a strong majority in the House and, with the backing of a few other smaller forces, they can manage two-thirds majority needed to amend the constitution. But when it comes to political issues, even the small parties in the coalition are hardly on the same page. So numerical strength alone won’t work. Hence there has been no progress on constitution amendment in the past five months. These pledges were made just to create a pretext to get to power.Is the present government any different to the erstwhile Dahal-led coalition, particularly on delivery?No. In the seven-point agreement, they pledged to improve the ailing economy. We don’t find any reform and the economy is still stagnant. I can’t recall a single thing this government has done that is worth appreciating. The only thing this coalition has achieved is ending unusual power manoeuverings by Prachanda [Maoist Centre chair Pushpa Kamal Dahal]. The way Dahal was switching alliance partners between the Congress and the UML was unnatural. The present coalition ended the trend, at least for now. Also, some unhealthy activities taking place in provinces have been stopped. But the government has utterly failed to provide any relief to the people. What about the process of amending the constitution?The Congress and the UML leaders have often blamed the proportional representation (PR) electoral system for the country’s political instability. The UML proposed to limit the scope of the PR system to the National Assembly and some Congress leaders have also floated this idea. After the formation of this government, many people assumed that this coalition may take some action to implement those propositions. But doing so is not easy. Despite a strong majority in the House, the Congress and the UML alone can’t amend the constitution. Other small parties won’t support them to water down the PR system. The top leaders are conspicuously silent as they know diverse issues are going to open up once they start the process. For instance, the Rastriya Prajatantra Party wants to revive Hindu monarchy and the Madhes-based parties have their own grievances. Moreover, if you analyse the election results since 2008, it’s not difficult to infer that not only small parties but even the major forces will think twice before making any changes to the PR system. Be it big or small, old or new parties, all have gotten a significant number of seats under the PR category. In the first Constituent Assembly election in 2008, the Congress and the UML were in crisis. It was the PR system that saved them from being pushed into an existential crisis. Besides that, there is one big political reason behind the adoption of this electoral system and that is to ensure representation of various underprivileged communities in state organs. We can’t forget that context. Hence the Congress and UML leaders have been silent on the constitution amendment in the past couple of months.Is there any need to review or amend the constitution?There is a need to seriously review and analyse the problems faced in the course of implementing the constitution in the past nine years. For instance, the vice-president has no role. He can be made ex-officio chair of the National Assembly, as in India. Then, the state doesn’t need to elect the upper house chair. This option was discussed during constitution writing as well. Recently, we conducted by-polls to fill the vacant positions of chiefs of local units. These polls were unnecessary as there can be a provision to entrust the deputy chiefs with the responsibility of carrying out the chief’s duties when the position goes vacant. There is a need for a comprehensive review and changes in some provisions based on the practical experience of statute implementation. But there are different parties and groups that want to raise different political agendas. For instance, some want a more powerful federal system while others want to scrap the system and revive Hindu monarchy. How should we review the national charter and what kind of mechanism will be right for that?The best way is through a review commission composed of politicians and subject experts. But leaders don’t trust independent experts who don’t follow their instructions. Forming a body of experts loyal to the leaders is meaningless. Therefore, a special parliamentary committee can be entrusted with this task. The panel will be composed of members from political parties based on their strength in the House. The parties and other stakeholders can submit their formal proposals to the committee and the experts can give their inputs to the same panel. The body can help give shape to the ongoing debates and discussions will take place in a more organised and formal way. It can conduct a thorough study of the complications seen in the course of constitution implementation. My emphasis is not on amending the constitution on political grounds but from the perspectives of removing difficulties experienced in the course of implementation. For instance, provinces have failed to prove their relevance. Now, we need to study where the problems are. But I don’t think the political parties are going to work on this issue with the seriousness it deserves. Leaders, of late, have proposed to increase the threshold to secure seats under the PR category, which can be done by amending election laws. They have floated the idea of increasing the PR threshold to five percent. [At present, it is three percent at the federal and 1.5 percent at the provincial level]. If it is increased to five percent, hardly four or five political parties may qualify for the PR seats. So this is not an appropriate proposal. To ensure political stability, we have to instead develop a system supportive of a coalition culture. The problem lies in our leaders and not in the constitution. For instance, why did Prachanda switch alliances multiple times after the last election? There is no point in blaming the system for instability. To discuss and debate all these issues, we need a review body.What is your analysis of the recent local by-polls results?The voting pattern shows that the big parties couldn’t increase their vote shares and failed to attract voters. The Congress lost more seats in comparison to the last by-polls. The UML had mixed results while the Maoist Centre made some gains. As it fought single-handedly this time, the Congress lost some seats that it had won with the support of alliance partners last time. This is natural. The Maoist Centre appears to have benefitted by being in the opposition and as it concentrated its strengths in select areas for the past few months. Party chief Dahal himself visited some remote local units. The Congress doesn’t appear serious about reviewing its poor performance while the UML has decided to study the matter and find what went wrong. The Maoist leaders look excited but the party has not made much progress in popular votes. There are assumptions of some informal collaborations between the Maoist Centre and the Rastriya Swatantra Party. The way Dahal has defended Rabi Lamichhane in recent days backs the assumption.Why do you think the performance of new forces including the RSP and Janamat were poor in the by-polls?My assumption is that voters rethought the need to change the party of their choice if the main objective of the leaders from new parties is to be ministers. RSP chief Rabi Lamichhane insisted on becoming home minister. In the meantime, recent investigations have shown his linkages to cooperative scams. People might have thought that he is not a clean person. These factors might have played a role. Last time, people supported new forces not to make their leaders ministers but for political reforms. The chief minister from Janamat Party who is leading the provincial government in Madhesh formed a 20-member Cabinet, which is the biggest ever there. He downsized it only after severe criticism. Such developments certainly play a role in elections. These are just assumptions. We can’t jump to conclusions but it is safe to say that Nepali voters are consistently trying to find better alternatives.While there were reports of former President Bidya Devi Bhandari rejoining the UML to return to active politics, former Vice-President Nanda Bahadur Pun is most likely to join the Maoist Centre. What kind of precedent will this set?I don’t see serious problems in former vice-presidents rejoining active politics as they don’t play any vital role as vice-presidents. But the issue of former Presidents returning to active politics is serious as such a precedent will invite serious anomalies. Though the constitution and laws don't bar former presidents from making such a comeback, politics should be guided by certain values, principles and convictions. Bhandari’s return to active politics will be unfortunate. It should be stopped. \nPrime Minister KP Sharma Oli returned home on December 5 after a four-day official visit to China. During the visit, the two countries signed the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) Framework Cooperation agreement. The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal sat down with Bishnu Rimal, chief advisor to the prime minister, who was one of the key interlocutors during the framework agreement negotiations, for insights on how the deals were finalised between the two countries.There are many queries about the details of the agreements signed between Nepal and China last week. Please tell us about the key points.Nepal and China had been exchanging documents related to the Belt and Road Initiative of China since 2020, under the BRI implementation plan. While signing any agreement, the two countries engage in rigorous negotiations and at times it takes a long time even to finalise a word. This time, we signed a framework agreement, which is like a basket, where we have put many things. It’s different from a memorandum of understanding (MoU). In the agreement, we have described its background, principles, objectives, the modality of mobilising financial resources and implementing mechanisms. Even the previous government led by Pushpa Kamal Dahal had planned to finalise it but it didn’t in the end. Now we have taken it ahead. The new agreement should be understood in a context. In 2016, we were in government [during Oli’s first tenure] and we visited Beijing. At the time, China was supporting Nepal through the Trans-Himalayan Multi-Dimensional Connectivity Network (THMDCN) package. Later, the support was provided through the BRI and the THMDCN became a part of it. Nepal reached an MoU to this effect in 2017. After that, an implementation plan needed to be signed. Following the formation of the present government, we held discussions on this. The two major coalition partners—the Nepali Congress and the CPN-UML—formed a four-member team for this specific purpose. Party general secretary Gagan Thapa and lawyer Semanta Dahal from the Nepali Congress and Yubaraj Khatiwada ji and myself from the UML were in the team. In the past, we have reached several agreements with China, India, the United States, Japan and various other countries and sought support from them. But we haven’t been able to properly utilise the support. Our [taskforce’s] focus was to ensure best use of the pledged amount and implement the agreements. At first, we studied the documents exchanged after 2020. At the beginning we forged consensus between the UML and the Congress and then shared the document with the Chinese side because it can only be implemented after it is acceptable for both sides. This time, we wanted to take the implementation process ahead because Nepal joined the BRI process years ago. Nepal has already joined China’s Global Development Initiative, which is an international development concept. But there were some confusions about our participation in development projects under the BRI. There needed to be more clarity on our side. At times, it has been dragged into controversy. We wanted to dispel rumours and confusions.First of all we all should know that the BRI is a framework and the agreement we signed is a basket deal. Later, we will select specific projects and negotiate on particular details and conditions. In fact, the debate ahead of the prime minister’s visit was driven by whether to take loans or grants from China. That was wrong. It is rather a project-based approach. On certain projects, we need all grants while on certain others, we may jointly develop them. Still in other projects, we have to seek concessional loans. All these things depend on what project we are talking about. If a project can pay back the loan, that could be dealt accordingly. But our discussions were driven by the concept of loan versus grant. Even top leaders got swayed by such narratives and reacted accordingly. China has declared huge grants to Nepal multiple times since 2016. But we haven’t been able to use them as we have to earmark the amounts and seek them. First, we have to say that we are going to use this money in these projects. We at the task force concluded that the amount of the grants pledged by China is enough for us for now. There is no need to take out a loan now. Our priority is to get the grants that have been stuck for years. Do we need to select certain projects for that?Yes, we have to first finalise the projects and prepare business plans. We can explore other options only if the grant money is insufficient for a particular project. For instance, if we start working on a cross-border railway, we would discuss whether the grant money is sufficient and whether to seek more grants or go for loans. We aren’t in that stage now. We are yet to receive the grant announced during the visit of Chinese President Xi Jinping in 2019. Similarly, grants were announced during the China visits of then President Bidya Devi Bhandari, first President Rambaran Yadav and our prime minister KP Sharma Oli. Also, this time, the Chinese President has announced 500 million RMB in assistance. So, again, first we have to work to receive and use the grant money. For instance, recently, the Chinese side announced to provide electric vehicles worth US$10 million as support through the Chinese embassy. The EVs include public buses, ambulances and school vans but they release them only after we provide the specifications of the vehicles that we need. The amount we sign as a budgetary support can be used wherever we want but other sums are released only after we earmark them for certain projects. After a long negotiation, Nepal and China have agreed on the term ‘aid assistance financing’. What does that mean?During the negotiation, we had used the term ‘grant and different financing modalities’. Later, we agreed to replace the word ‘grant’ with ‘aid’. We did so as we wanted to keep the door open in terms of seeking support from a country. If we say that we won’t receive any support except grants, it creates complications in the overall investment scenario. The Chinese government may provide a certain amount of grant to the government of Nepal but it doesn’t give it to the private sector.If Nepal’s private sector plans to attract investment from China, the World Bank, the ADB or any other agencies, for example for a mega hydro project, they may not get it as the Chinese side knows that Nepal accepts only grants and no other form of investment. Such a condition creates complications as this agreement is applicable even for the private sector. Therefore, we didn’t want to close the door. We can’t say we accept loans from this country but not from the other. We accept assistance that serves our national interest.Will the negotiations now onward be project-specific then?Yes. It will be project and proposal specific. Such issues will be negotiated only when we discuss a certain project. Therefore, the ongoing debate over grants versus loan is pointless. For instance, we didn’t receive certain portions of the assistance announced by India immediately after the 2015 earthquakes. Such is also the case with China and with other countries on occasions as the conditions attached to them weren’t acceptable to us.After the failure in operating Pokhara Regional International Airport due to lack of business plans, people are now suspicious about the utilisation of any assistance fruitfully.How can you say the Pokhara airport project is a failure? First, one should study the airport’s capacity and check how many passengers are flying to Pokhara now. A good number of people are flying there. I think the interest rate on the loan we took from China to build the airport is no different to the rate we receive from the World Bank, the IMF and other multilateral agencies. We can debate whether we have been able to operate the airport in its full capacity. But there is no need to scandalise it unnecessarily.Ahead of the prime minister’s visit, there were voices that Nepal should seek a waiver of Pokhara airport loan from China. What happened?Let me ask you a question. Imagine, you took a loan from Rastriya Banijya Bank to meet your needs. Say, there is a government led by a leader who favours you. Can the prime minister waive off your bank loan? No. You have to follow the system. So your question is wrong. The Pokhara airport deal is not a grant. It’s a commercial deal. Those who run the government can’t use the language of Durga Prasai, who threatens not to pay back bank loans. What are the agreements on road connectivity and cross-border railway projects?We have included five points under the infrastructure-urban development project. These are Tokha-Chhahare Tunnel, Hilsa Simkot Road Project, Kathmandu-Khandbari Road, Kimathanka Bridge, the cross-border railway project from Rasuwagadhi to Kathmandu and the Amargadhi City Hall. Likewise, we have included a cross-border transmission line to start energy trade with China. Under education and health, we agreed to establish universities and colleges. The Chinese side is carrying out a feasibility study of the railway project with a plan to complete it by 2026. Once the study is complete, we will discuss the funding modalities and business plans.What is the status of the Tokha-Chhahare tunnel project?The China side is in a position to complete its feasibility study. After that, construction work will start.Nepal has signed so many agreements with China. While we have progressed a lot on paper, there is little progress on the ground. Will the present agreement make any substantive change in this connection?Nepal is behind on monitoring and follow up. We should have formed bilateral mechanisms and monitored work progress. Now, there is a sense of urgency in the government to expedite development works. An inter-agency mechanism will be formed within our government. It will monitor and facilitate the work and the line ministries will execute the plans.Why are the agreements signed with China not made public, unlike the deals inked with other countries?There is no problem in making them public because there is nothing to hide. But all agreements aren’t made public. The MCC Compact had to be taken to the parliament as people were divided over it. Then, it was publicly debated. Likewise, people are now expressing their curiosity towards the BRI documents. But there are many projects people don’t care about. When needed, the documents can be made public as nothing can be hidden these days. And there is nothing wrong in making them public.UMl’s coalition partner Congress was reportedly reluctant to sign the framework agreement. What was its concern?That is a wrong narrative. Both the UML and the Congress were on the same page. It was possible to conclude the agreements because we had consensus.But the Congress leaders expressed their concerns in public ahead of the visit and even after the signing of the deals.We have to follow the party’s official decisions, not the statements of individual leaders. How would it have been possible to reach agreements if there were differences in the two-party taskforce, in the leadership and the party’s official positions? It’s a Nepal-China agreement jointly done by the UML and the Congress, and backed by all other parties. The prime minister convened a meeting of former prime ministers and foreign ministers ahead of his visit. All of them advised the prime minister to sign the agreement with China. Why was the signing of the agreement delayed?While signing a bilateral agreement, we can’t think only from our perspective. Negotiation always takes long. The joint statement has stated that the two sides are ready to sign the BRI framework as soon as possible. It took time for us to share the documents with the Chinese side after we reached Beijing. It’s not like two leaders just sit, discuss and sign on that. They have to consult concerned ministries, departments and officials. The Chinese worked overnight after we submitted the documents. My impression is that the Chinese side showed magnanimity and adopted a short-cut approach and signed on the deals. They were ready to sign the agreements on our conditions. That was a wonderful gesture.What were the specific points of contention and how were they resolved?We substantially edited the documents that were exchanged in the past, making them more specific and converting them into a framework of cooperation. Therefore, the Chinese side needed at least a day to study them. They argued that it would work even without mentioning the word ‘grant’. In view of the narratives in Nepal, we proposed to use ‘grant’ or a word with similar meaning. Then, we proposed ‘aid assistance financing’, and they accepted the term.How will the new deal be implemented?There used to be confusion about whether a certain project is under the BRI. China said even the Pokhara airport project is under the BRI while we said it was initiated before that. Now onward, all projects with China will be under the BRI cooperation. All the financing and investments from China will enter Nepal through the BRI window. We will prioritise the projects already proposed and under study such as the railway project, Tokha-Chhahare tunnel, and Madan Bhandari University. We have agreed to strengthen connectivity on border points and work will be expedited there. That will help transform Nepal from a land-locked into a land-linked country.Why are the projects being developed with Chinese involvement so slow?These days the Chinese side tells us to give projects only after clearing the sites. For instance, the 17-km Syafrubeshi-Rasuwagadhi road is to be built by Chinese grants. There is one transmission pole standing in the way. We are yet to remove it from the construction site. They haven’t started the work citing the same reason. Creating an environment to work on the field is our responsibility. It’s not that only China-built projects are slow. Such is also the story with our projects with other countries and agencies. Even in the case of the MCC projects, it took a long time to finalise many issues. We are too slow in implementing agreements and executing projects. First, we have to do some retrospection and improve our efficiency.  \nWang Peng, a research fellow from the Institute of State Governance at Huazhong University, Wuhan, was previously Deputy Secretary-General of the National Academy of Belt and Road Green Development (NABRGD) Beijing. Peng, a keen observer of South Asian geopolitics, was recently in Kathmandu to participate in ‘Kantipur Conclave-2024’. He sat down with the Post’s Purushottam Poudel and Kantipur’s Jagdishor Panday to discuss a host of issues. Excerpt:How have Nepal-China relations evolved in recent times? Generally, bilateral ties between Nepal and China have been stable. Politically, China’s Nepal policy has been stable too. Even though the administration in Nepal has changed, Kathmandu still has a stable and friendly policy towards China. Relations are progressing steadily. But we still have room for progress. Nepal’s Prime Minister is visiting China in the first week of December. This is a perfect opportunity for the Nepali and Chinese governments to enhance mutual understanding and political trust. Face-to-face meetings between the leaders of two countries are crucial. Due to the Himalayas, many Chinese people, including me, consider Nepal a country far away. But actually, we are alongside each other, not far. Nepal is an hour’s distance from Lasha and a few hours from Chengdu, which is very close. Despite being a close neighbour, China is often accused of not investing enough in Nepal, at least as compared to its other neighbours. Why is this so? There is no need to compare countries as every country has its own conditions. China’s investment in Nepal is significant, especially considering Nepal’s current economic size, population, and capability to use foreign capital effectively. We may talk about the cooperation between China and Pakistan, with the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) as a flagship BRI program. China indeed has a massive investment in Pakistan. China has good relations with Pakistan for many reasons, one of them being that Pakistani politicians usually do not play the so-called “China card”. Despite political changes in Pakistan, relations between Beijing and Islamabad are seldom harmed. China is equal to every partner within the BRI framework, so the key variable essentially is the local leaders’ political choices and their ability to build consensus in domestic politics.What are you trying to suggest when you say Pakistan does not play China card? Many Chinese International Relations scholars, including me, appreciate Pakistan. What we appreciate about Pakistan is that despite their internal political differences, there is a bottom line that none of them uses China as a card. Because of this, Chinese companies dare to invest in Pakistan. This is good—good for these companies and good for the local guys—and this has created more than 10,000 jobs for the local guys over the past few years. In this way, China and Pakistan have accumulated a high level of strategic trust. Non-intervention has been the fundamental principle of Chinese foreign policy. In most developing countries, the government often changes. The country’s people can change the government if they think it has done no good to the citizens. We only hope that politicians do not use China as weapons when fighting for power. So the goal should be to devise a win-win plan to benefit both sides. You mentioned China’s investment preferences abroad. But don’t you think that the investment decisions of a democratic government and an undemocratic one like China will be different? China is a democratic country. People say that China is not a democratic country since it does not have an election. But the Chinese leaders are under intense pressure to think about history. The Chinese government and the leaders should work for the benefit of all the citizens of the country, not just for their supporters. For example, Donald Trump doesn’t need to serve all American people. Even if he supports the people who supported him during the election, his work is done. However, in China, this is not the case. The Chinese government should reconcile different peoples and encourage joint development of the country. A country like China, which is big both in terms of people and land mass, will split if the government does not tread cautiously. That’s China’s nightmare. We have suffered many tragedies in history, so we don’t want this kind of thing to happen again. The Chinese Communist Party, government and high-ranking leaders believe in history. That is why they try to create or design five-year institutions, projects, and reform plans.For example, the Chinese still celebrate Deng Xiaoping’s legacy. Despite being the leader who was not elected, did Deng use power arbitrarily? No. He prudently used his power to ensure that even 50 years down the lane, the country’s people remember him as a leader who greatly benefitted them. Other Chinese political leaders have also taken responsibility for all Chinese people and have made significant reforms to create an environment for business, and for investment in new technology, such as AI and space technology. How do you assess China’s relationship with South Asian countries in general? We should not indulge in conflict. We need resolution and reconciliation with India in the border conflict. All the neighbouring countries, including Nepal, have no border conflict. Apart from India and Bhutan, China has no border conflict with our neighbouring countries. Bhutan is happy to sign a border contract with China, but maybe they are waiting for the message from New Delhi. China will not exert any pressure. It is reasonable for China to be silent about other countries’ internal affairs. Sometimes, the decisions of neighbouring countries are not suitable for China’s interests, but China often keeps quiet and waits for good things to happen. We don’t have any land ambition in our neighbouring countries; we have enough land. If so, why is there conflict in the South China Sea? We don’t have land ambition, so we don’t want an inch of land from other countries. At the same time, we are determined not to abandon an inch of our land.If you look at the United Nations P-5 countries, which are permanent security council members, China is the most prudent country in which decisions are not made by weapons. In South Asia, China-India relations have again started to improve. It's a good beginning. China's relations with other South Asian countries, including Nepal, are stable. China and India are ancient civilisations. We have enough power to solve our problems together. We don’t need a third party’s long hand. We don’t need this kind of teaching. We are brothers; if we have problems, we can solve them together. The best way to resolve the problem between China and India is to develop mutual political trust, security resolution, and economic cooperation, which I believe will happen. Thanks to the potential threat from Donald Trump’s reelection, the two leaders of China and India have used their political wisdom to make changes in advance and create a better atmosphere for the future. Apart from security, what are China’s other concerns in Nepal?The bottom line in China’s foreign policy with neighbouring countries is peace and stability. If you read the Chinese line, we admire mutual respect. We desire friendly countries to commit to ‘One China’. Second, China would also like to promote economic cooperation with Nepal. Not only with Nepal but also with all countries. We want a simple process of import and export, a good business environment, and transparency in law and policy. If the above-mentioned things are achieved, Chinese companies will dare to increase their investment [in Nepal]. Nepal has long been an adamant supporter of ‘One China policy’. But now it has also committed to uphold ‘One China principle’? What does this shift entail for Nepal?To be precise, there is no difference. China’s bottom line is principle; for our friends, that’s policy. If they accept the One China principle, they will conduct a One China policy, which means they will not develop official contact with Taiwan. Earlier in Nepal, there used to be a discourse that Nepal could be a bridge between India and China, but you have come up with a larger perspective that Nepal could not only be a door to South Asia but also to East Asia. Can you elaborate?We don’t say Nepal or any other country should do this or that. We say we expect something. Frankly, China and India are both robust in population, land mass, and economies. Additionally, India is a young country. China also has its own advantage. Nepal has been blocked geographically by these two countries. But Nepal can potentially be the hub, not limited to the periphery. At least in the next three decades, both China and India can offer the most attractive economic opportunities in the world. If Nepal treads cautiously, it can enjoy the benefit of its location. Geography is constant, but political geography is variable and changes.If China and India go against each other, it might be a nightmare for the Nepali people. But, if China-India come together, even if not like in the 1950s, to make a rational decision not to let the border conflict escalate and promote trade, Nepal can enjoy its location as the intermediary rather than as a bridge. Rather than a bridge, Nepal should be a port. In this way, Nepal can earn a lot with China and India because both countries should get permission from Nepal to use its ports to export and import the goods they want. Bring goods from China’s Tibet Autonomous Region to Nepal and then transit to India. Bring goods from Indian cities to Nepal and transit to China via Tibet Autonomous Region. It is a very short distance, and much better. China is never envious of Nepal and India’s bilateral ties. We will never put sand in the wheels of Kathmandu-New Delhi relations. We know you are friends. But don’t make the friendship exclusive; it should be inclusive.You mentioned that China does not meddle in the internal affairs of other countries. But China has tried to bring communist parties in Nepal together and has been holding ideological discussions with these parties. Isn’t this selective engagement a form of meddling?First, one should know that in China, “international affairs” (among the governments of sovereign countries) are handled by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (中华人民共和国外交部) under the central government, the same as in other countries. At the same time, “inter-party affairs” (between the CPC and all other friendly parties in the world) are handled by the International Department, Central Committee of CPC (中共中央对外联络部) within the Party system.The mission of both the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the International Department of the CPC Central Committee is to promote mutual understanding, friendship and cooperation between the Chinese government, the Communist Party of China and the Chinese people and governments, political parties and peoples of other countries, but the division of labor between the two is slightly different. There are some misreadings and misunderstandings.First, it said that the International Department of the CPC only communicates with communist or left-wing parties. That is wrong. In fact, the International Department speaks on behalf of the Communist Party of China and all political parties around the world that are friendly to China, including both the ruling and opposition parties.Second, it said that the International Department had contacts with opposition parties in other countries. This statement is also wrong. The International Department and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs have their own priorities. The ministry and the government agencies carry out diplomatic activities and naturally deal with the ruling parties of other countries.However, the International Department of the CPC Central Committee conducts exchanges with all political parties that are friendly to China, in line with international norms and practices. Everything is above board and conducive to mutual understanding, mutual trust and win-win cooperation between the two governments, two parties and two peoples.“Non-intervention in internal affairs” (不干涉他国内政) and “foreign affairs are not defined by ideology” (不以意识形态划线) are two major principles of the CPC and the Chinese government.As Sun Yeli, spokesman for the 20th National Congress of the Communist Party of China (CPC) said on October 15, 2022, the CPC maintains different forms of contacts with more than 600 political parties and organisations in more than 170 countries, and the international circle of friends is growing.“The more friends, the better.” As Sun Yeli said, for a long time, and on the basis of the principles of independence, complete equality, mutual respect and non-interference in each other's internal affairs, the Communist Party of China has had extensive exchanges with friendly political parties and political forces of other countries, and its international circle of friends has been growing.In recent years, China has hosted the World Political Party Leaders Summit and high-level Dialogue, attended by more than 500 leaders of political parties and organisations from over 160 countries and more than 10,000 political party representatives. The development of political party relations has driven and promoted the development of state-to-state relations and enhanced the understanding and friendship between the peoples.Sun Yeli said the CPC attaches importance to exchanges with Marxist political parties in other countries. Through theoretical exchanges and policy dialogue, they jointly explore the path of socialist development suitable for their respective national conditions and explore their respective paths to realise the localisation of Marxism.“The CPC's foreign affairs are not defined by ideology,” Sun said, adding that the CPC is willing to make friends with all kinds of political parties of all countries, irrespective of the ideology they uphold, as long as they are friendly to China and willing to conduct exchanges with the CPC.How is China seeing Nepal’s Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli’s Beijing visit, which will commence on December 2? Nepal’s prime minister, especially from the communist parties, often visits China. Big promises and agreements are made during the visits, but they seldom materialise. How hopeful is China about Prime Minister Oli’s visit this time?I am not a foreign ministry official. So I cannot represent the Chinese government. Over the past decade, China-Nepal relations have made remarkable progress. Political mutual trust between the two sides has steadily increased, and economic cooperation has yielded initial results. There is an old saying in China, “haste makes waste.” In other words, whether it is to develop bilateral relations or the economy through economic and trade cooperation, these things must conform to the objective economic conditions and cannot be rushed. Steady improvement and steady progress are the best. \nFormer Indian chief election commissioner SY Quraishi is a strong advocate of credible elections and inclusive democracy. He has extensively spoken and written on how increasing flow of money in elections is taking away the level playing field for candidates from different backgrounds. During his recent visit to Kathmandu, Binod Ghimire of the Post and Suresh Raj Neupane and Rajesh Mishra of Kantipur talked to him on a range of issues from electoral reforms, challenges in maintaining election sanctity in the age of generative artificial intelligence, to why the world is swinging right. Excerpts:Elections and democracy are intertwined. However, recent election results the world over are being seen as a threat to law and democracy. How do you see this phenomenon?Democracy and elections are two sides of the same coin. Without elections, there is no democracy. And worldwide, for the past 10 years, there is a swing towards the right, even in the US. In India, of course, we have been on the right for the past 10 years and our prime minister got a third term, though with a bit of reduced majority.The other thing is that in the past 10-12 years, there has been a debate on whether democracy is on a decline worldwide. The fact is that several indices of democracy indicate the decline. But people’s will cannot be taken as a threat to democracy. Sometimes they go to the left, sometimes, they move to the right. We cannot call it a threat to democracy. The democracy indices which I mentioned have a different classification.First, there are full democracies. Then there are flawed democracies. Third is hybrid democracies. The fourth is an authoritarian regime. So even in South Asia, we have one or two countries which are authoritarian, like Afghanistan and Pakistan. Their ranking keeps going up or down depending on the electoral and democratic performance. In India, the right-wing is ruling, but they lost some majority. They are now depending on two other parties, which are not considered right-wing. Of course, Trump got an absolute majority this time winning both popular vote and electoral votes. He also won both the houses. So, this is what can make him dictatorial. As it is, he is mercurial, and everybody is speculating how he is going to behave. Let’s wait and see.We can agree that people cannot be taken as a threat to democracy. But can we say that the elections, rather than complementing the spirit of democracy, are turning into tools to endorse majoritarianism?Well, people’s will is supreme. If they have chosen absolute governments, if they have given large majorities, you cannot blame the people. Many times a lot of money is being used in elections, and only the rich people get to win elections. In India, for instance, 93 percent of MPs who got elected are crorepatis [multi-millionaires]. Now, law provides for a ceiling on expenditure, so that level playing field is established, where you and I can also contest.But then, the ceiling on expenditure in India has one flaw—it is only for candidates, not political parties. This negates or neutralises the purpose of the ceiling. You can’t spend more than 1 crore, but your party can spend 20 crores on you. So where is the level playing field? Some people say there should be state funding of elections. I oppose the idea but recommend state funding of political parties. It is difficult to monitor election expenditure because of black money. Funding political parties with cheques is what I recommend because it is easy to monitor. So you think election management is more of a problem than the electoral system?Actually, both are important, because obviously the management follows what the system prescribes. There are laws, there are rules, and they have to be followed. For instance, on political funding, there is a cap on expenditure provided by law, and the election management body implements it. Therefore, we have to improve both. Both are equally important. We say public consciousness has increased with time, but there are also concerns that people are picking right-wing leaders. So what is wrong?Actually, it’s a good question but difficult to answer. Why is it that the whole world is turning right? But there are also states like Austria where everybody was thinking the extreme right was winning, but then liberals won. So, there are exceptions. Maybe people want a strong and stable government, which has the benefit of continuity. On the other hand, such a government can be accused of majoritarianism.I heard your prime minister, Oli-ji, mentioning frequent government changes. Obviously, how can the government function with this kind of instability? On the other hand there is the prime minister of India who has been elected for the third term. It is the people's choice, and you can't fault the people. The people chose stability and a strong government, and we have to respect that.Are people not knowledgeable enough to pick the right representatives for themselves?This question is often raised. For instance, we were talking about crorepatis and criminals in politics. Almost 46 percent of MPs in India have criminal cases against them. When we talk to these MPs, they say, look, people are choosing us, so how can you blame us? That way the blame is passed on to the people.Why is the electorate choosing dishonest people against whom there are criminal cases? This debate leads us nowhere. So obviously there is something good these people with criminal background must be doing in the constituency. Maybe they commit crime outside the constituency and like Robin Hood, benefit their own people.Aam Aadmi Party was a new party, and won 67 out of 70 seats in Delhi. They managed funds through crowdfunding and volunteers. And they won hands down.What are the issues that have come up with the proliferation of social media and new media?Social media and new media have revolutionised communication. But, initially, when the election commission of India in 2012 or 2013 came out with some regulation, there was a lot of public criticism, which was unjustified. Social media is also media. So whatever applies to media will apply to social media. And in the election context, what applies to the media? Two things: How much money are you spending on buying space in the newspaper and how much money are you paying to the TV channel?Therefore, how much money are you paying to Facebook or WhatsApp, you have to account for it as well. The law on expenditure will apply to social media also. The second concern was how will the election commission catch the violators, as they are anonymous. The difficulty in catching them cannot be an excuse for not taking cognisance of their offence. If we cannot catch them today, tomorrow we will. How can something be illegal in a newspaper and legal on social media?Rumours always play a big role in elections. Social media has multiplied the problem a thousand times. Within two, three minutes, your country can be burned by false, fake news. Social media however has many benefits. For instance, instead of buying space in the newspaper and TV channel, through WhatsApp or Twitter you can reach your audience in two seconds flat.So social media is a double-edged weapon, as was the consensus in the Kantipur Conclave. And, you know, it is like a knife. Is a knife good or bad? If you want to cut an apple, it is good. If you want to cut a man’s throat, it is bad. It depends how you use it. Now, artificial intelligence has given rise to even deep fakes. But AI has benefits too. Through artificial intelligence, impersonation can be stopped. Voting and logistics can be monitored. But there is so much fraud, deep fakes, and hate. So how do you catch them? That is something we have to be wary about. Frankly, I am worried because its dangers outweigh the benefits. We have to put our heads together globally to make sure artificial intelligence doesn’t overtake human intelligence for destructive ends.In Nepal, both federal and provincial elections happen at once. India too is now mulling ‘one nation, one election’. What is your take on this?There are benefits and there are problems. Logistically, it makes sense. But one MP of Odisha posed this question: ask the people. What do they want? Poor people love frequent elections because this is the only way they can highlight their importance. Otherwise, how many times have we seen that posters are put up in a constituency with headings like ‘Missing’, or ‘Wanted’ [representatives]? Frequent elections make the representatives accountable.We heard you say that if India does ‘one nation, one election’, that will be the presidential election. What do you mean?During parliamentary elections, there are national and international issues. The issues are different in Parliament [national], Vidhan Sabha [state-level] and Panchayat [local]. I would like to say that the local body elections are as important, perhaps more important because they’re closer to the people.India’s prime minister initially said that there would be a national debate and a consensus would be reached. There was a debate for 10 years, but there was no consensus.If there was no consensus, the idea should have been dropped. But the government decided unilaterally that we will go ahead and set up a committee led by the former president of India to suggest ways to implement ‘one nation, one election’. In my articles I have questioned the propriety of a former president being drawn into a government committee.They have made some questionable recommendations. They say that simultaneous will mean Vidhan Sabha and Lok Sabha, not Panchayat. But the terms of reference clearly say that simultaneous means all three tiers. Then it says Panchayat elections can be held after 100 days. After 100 days, there is a separate election. It’s a new election and will require totally different arrangements. These are also not simultaneous elections.  \nThe Meteorological Forecasting Division has forecast light snowfall in one or two places in the hilly regions of Karnali and Sudurpaschim provinces. Some areas in the hilly regions of these provinces may also experience light rain. Similarly, the Tarai regions of Karnali and Sudurpaschim are likely to witness light to moderate rainfall. The weather is expected to remain clear during the day in the Himalayan, hilly, and Tarai regions of Koshi, Madhesh, and Bagmati provinces. However, partial to moderate cloud cover is anticipated in the Tarai regions of these provinces at night. Gandaki and Lumbini provinces are likely to experience partially cloudy weather today. \nThe Meteorological Forecasting Division has said that the country is currently experiencing the partial influence of a western disturbance and a low-pressure system. As of now, hilly regions are partly to generally cloudy, while the rest of the country remains partly cloudy to mostly clear. Some areas of the Tarai are covered with fog or mist. This afternoon, hilly areas of Gandaki and Koshi provinces are expected to have partly cloudy to mainly clear skies, with mostly clear weather predicted for the rest of the country. Tonight, hilly regions of Sudurpaschim, Karnali, Lumbini, and Gandaki provinces will experience partly to generally cloudy skies, while other areas will remain mostly clear. Light snowfall is expected in one or two high-altitude locations in Gandaki Province. \nSeveral provinces, including Sudurpaschim, Karnali, Lumbini, and Gandaki, will witness light to moderate rainfall starting Friday night as moisture-laden westerly wind enters the country from the Mediterranean Sea.The Kathmandu valley will also witness light rainfall on Saturday due to the western disturbances, the Meteorological Forecasting Division of the Department of Hydrology and Meteorology said.“Sudurpaschim and Karnali Province will witness light to moderate rainfall. Lumbini, Gandaki Province, will receive light rain,” said Saroj Pudasaini, a meteorologist at the division. “Hilly and mountainous areas of Gandaki Province will witness snowfall.”Meteorologists say that the western disturbance is a phenomenon that affects the weather patterns of the Indian subcontinent, including Nepal. It is a low-pressure system that originates in the Mediterranean region and moves eastward.“Western parts of the country will be affected much, and the weather system will become weak when it moves eastward,” said Binod Pokhrel, an associate professor at the Central Department of Hydrology and Meteorology. “Even if rain does not occur in the eastern part, the day will remain cloudy on Saturday.”The rain is expected to bring relief from rising air pollution. Met officials say the temperature will decline further due to the rain. Kathmandu Valley witnessed scattered rainfall on Tuesday evening, but due to cloudy conditions, the minimum temperature did not fall much on Wednesday morning.According to the Met Office, the minimum temperature of the Valley was recorded 6.7 degrees Celsius on Wednesday morning.The weather will improve from Sunday. \nThe Meteorological Forecasting Division has said that western disturbances and a low-pressure system are currently influencing Nepal. Madhesh, Lumbini, Bagmati, and Gandaki provinces are experiencing generally cloudy conditions, while other parts of the country have partial to clear skies. Fog and mist were observed in a few locations in the Tarai and the Kathmandu Valley this morning. Light snowfall is expected in some high hilly and Himalayan areas, with fog or mist likely in the Tarai and the Valley during the early hours.   \n\nBe elaborative as possible. I need more text.
