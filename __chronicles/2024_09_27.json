Write it in the form of inspiring story not news article or event.\n    \n    Story:\nOnce upon a time, nestled between the towering peaks of the Himalayas and the lush jungles of the Terai, there was a country named Nepal. Though still a developing nation, Nepal was a land of profound beauty and deep-rooted cultural heritage. The residents of Nepal faced many challenges, but beneath these hardships lay a resilient spirit and an unyielding hope for the future.\n\nThis enchanting land, where Mount Everest reaches towards the skies and the air carries a mix of incense and cool mountain breezes, was more than a geographical marvel. It was a mosaic of cultures, languages, and traditions, a testament to human endeavor against all odds. Nepal's history, from the unification under King Prithvi Narayan Shah to its transformation into a federal democratic republic, told a story of aspiration and endurance.\n\nIn recent years, the people of Nepal, with their indomitable will, had taken strides towards rebuilding and reimagining their country. They turned their struggles into stepping stones, each challenge a chapter in their ongoing saga. The shift from a monarchy to a republic had not only changed governance but had woven a new tapestry of democratic values and collective decision-making.\n\nEconomically, while agriculture continued to sustain a large part of its population, Nepal had begun to harness the potential of its picturesque landscapes, developing sustainable tourism that promised to preserve their natural heritage while boosting local economies. Communities living in the shadows of the Himalayas had become stewards of the earth, protecting the biodiversity that made their country unique.\n\nEach day brought new stories. Whether it was a festival in Kathmandu, a technological advance in Pokhara, or a conservation effort in Chitwan, these events were threads in the vibrant quilt of Nepali life. These stories, updated daily, reflected the pulse of progress and the spirit of hope that characterized this resilient nation.\n\nAnd so, as Nepal moved forward, each moment was not just a passage of time but a promise of potential, a narrative of a nation perennially climbing towards tomorrow, guided by the legacy of its past and the dreams of its future.\n\nNews events:\nAfter being ousted from government for the first time in nine years, the CPN (Maoist Centre) appears to be at a turning point as it seeks to redefine its vision of socialism. In the wake of consultative meetings in seven provinces and its foreign units, party leaders have stressed the need for fresh ideas based on the party’s historic Chunwang meeting of 2005 that adopted ‘democratic republicanism’.Until this July, the party has continuously been in power since the promulgation of the constitution in 2015. Back during the insurgency days, the meeting held at Chunwang in Rukum district had endorsed the party’s political line advocating for promulgating a constitution through a constituent assembly. On this basis, the party in 2006 signed the Comprehensive Peace Accord with the then seven-party alliance and laid down arms to enter mainstream politics.The 2015 constitution envisions Nepal as a socialism-oriented country, with the Maoist Centre playing a key role in shaping that direction. But why, after all these years, is the party revisiting the question of socialism?Maoist Centre spokesman, Agni Sapkota, argues that the party has been discussing socialism in various forums. “But this time, we want a more intense and focussed discussion.” Tensions within the party also came to light during the party’s standing committee meeting in August where office bearers openly questioned the leadership of Pushpa Kamal Dahal. In response, the party decided to hold consultative meetings in all provinces to discuss the matter. Besides the provincial meetings, the party also consulted its foreign branches known as ‘pradesh committees’ in India, West Asia, and Eurasia.According to Sapkota, the Maoist Centre leadership got three mandates at the consultative meetings that concluded on September 20.“Besides the need for discussion on party ideology, the consultative meetings’ mandates include improving organisational management and updating party statute, changing leaders’ behaviour, and improving their secretariat work,” Sapkota told the Post. Likewise, another party leader, Dor Prasad Upadhyaya, says democratic socialism naturally aligns with the ideology of the Nepali Congress, whereas ‘people’s multiparty democracy’ is the ideology of the CPN-UML. “As for the Maoist Center, we lack a distinct political ideology clearly reflecting the party’s vision.”Although the party claims its ideology is ‘people’s democracy of the 21st century’, party leaders admit that its impact is diluted by lack of commitment. Party leaders said that there was no call for a leadership change during the consultative meetings. However, at the standing committee meeting in August, a deputy general secretary of the party, Janardan Sharma, submitted a 14-page document calling for a change in party leadership.Sharma and Barsha Man Pun—another deputy general secretary of the Maoist party—urged Dahal to pass over party reins to new generation leaders. According to leaders, some within the party feel that Dahal should not leave a leadership vacuum until a clear plan for leadership transition is in place.Likewise, Ram Karki, the party’s secretary, says the consultative meetings were focussed at preparing a political document that would be presented at the central committee meeting in November. “The consultative meetings were focused on the party’s diminishing influence in national politics,” Karki told the Post. “Despite our party leaders who were in government claiming that they did an excellent job, why hasn’t that reflected in the party’s life? This was a major concern expressed during the meetings.”Karki said the meeting also directed the party to remain open for cooperation with other parties with socialist inclinations. When asked about possible cooperation with the Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP), Karki dismissed the idea. “Lately, there have been some points of agreement between the two parties. But, I don’t see any prospect of the two parties getting into a working partnership,” Karki said. “The consultative meetings have said the party leadership is open to cooperation with socialist parties except the RSP.”The RSP—which was one of the junior partners in the immediate past government led by Maoist Centre chief Dahal before the government was toppled on July 12—appears to be on the same page with the Maoist Centre on many issues lately. But the two parties rule out cooperation on the political front.Party spokesperson Sapkota also says that his party can cooperate with the RSP in parliament on issues of public interest, but there is no possibility of forging a working alliance with the party. RSP chair Rabi Lamichhane, who presented his political document at the party's first national conference held for two days in Kathmandu earlier this month, also hinted at potential cooperation with like-minded parties. Despite this, RSP leaders declined cooperation with the Maoist Centre. The Maoist Centre’s consultative meetings have suggested that the party consider unification with other parties in order to revitalise the communist movement, Sapkota added.  \nAfter deferring hearings on it for more than 60 times, the Supreme Court had earmarked June 5 for the verdict announcement on the writ petition demanding an investigation into a case of murder after abduction against CPN (Maoist Centre) leader Agni Sapkota.The Chief Justice Bishowambhar Prasad Shrestha-led five-member bench, however, postponed the verdict to August 7 and then to August 28. Finally, on Wednesday, the bench issued an order to seek the necessary documents, refraining from passing the verdict.The top court has directed the District Police Office, Kavrepalanchok, to present the original documents showcasing progress made in investigating the case as per its past direction. “If no investigation has been done, explain the reasons,” reads the ruling.According to lawyers advocating the case, such rulings are made at the time of hearing, not at the time of announcing the verdict.“The court had the documents it wanted. I don’t think it was necessary to see any other decision. It is clear that the verdict was intentionally deferred as a senior politician is linked to the case,” Pushpa Raj Poudel, an advocate pleading the case on behalf of the plaintiff, told the Post. “Seven chief justices have retired since the case was filed. I don’t know how long it will take.” Arjun Bahadur Lama, 45, was attending a meeting at a local school in Dapcha of Kavrepalanchok district on April 29, 2005, when a group of then-CPN-Maoist combatants spirited him away, saying they wanted to talk to him about something. The rebels never let him go.A subsequent probe by the National Human Rights Commission concluded that the Maoists had killed Lama following the abduction. His family members accused Maoist leaders Agni Sapkota and Suryaman Dong, among others, of abducting and murdering Lama. Sapkota and Dong, however, deny the accusation. The frequent attempts of Purnimaya, Arjun’s wife, to register a first information report was turned down by the Kavre district police, prompting her to knock the Supreme Court’s door on March 3, 2008 asking for its intervention in the case.The police registered the case after the top court’s directive to immediately accept the complaint and update it on the proceedings every 15 days. Kavre police wrote to Sindhupalchok police to find and arrest Sapkota. But Sindhupalchok police reported that Sapkota was nowhere to be found.Sapkota got elected to Parliament from Sindhupalchok thrice after the complaint was lodged and went on to become a Cabinet member and then the Speaker.After submitting a few quarterly reports, the police stopped updating the court on the progress in the investigation. Meanwhile, in 2011, Sapkota was appointed the minister for information and communication. A public interest litigation was filed by a group of human rights activists challenging his ministerial appointment. They argued that Sapkota as a minister could influence the investigation.Although the court refused to issue an interim order against his appointment, it raised serious concerns over the lack of progress in the probe. The court, however, said that as Sapkota was under the scanner, it was up to him and his mother party to make a moral judgment on whether he should resign.It also ordered the police to carry out the investigation effectively and independently. However, the police didn’t abide by the ruling. On July 12, 2o12 the government decided to stop the investigation and Purnimaya moved the court against the decision. Responding to her petition, the Supreme Court then ordered the government not to stop the investigation process.In March 2016, the court decided that the Constitutional Bench would henceforth hear the petitions filed by Purnimaya and civil society members. Since then, the hearing has been scheduled 63 times.Sapkota was elected Speaker in January 2020. Although human rights activists took to the streets against the appointment, little did it affect the Maoist Centre and other parties supporting him. He is vice-chairperson and spokesperson for the party.As the chief justice and justice Prakash Dhungana retire before the district police submits its report, the hearing needs to start from zero. Shrestha retires on October 4 and Dhungana on October 21.“It is unfortunate that the court takes over a decade to decide a case,” said Poudel. \nPrime Minister KP Sharma Oli, who is in New York to attend the 79th United Nations General Assembly (UNGA), held meetings with heads of government and ministers from various countries on Wednesday and Thursday.The prime minister met separately with Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Qatar’s Prime Minister Mohammed bin Abdulrahman bin Jassim Al Thani on the sidelines of the UNGA on Thursday. Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi also paid a visit to Prime Minister Oli on the same day.Officials at the prime minister’s office said the issues of mutual interests and concerns were discussed during the meetings.Earlier, he met Nobel laureate Bangladesh Chief Adviser Muhammad Yunus on Wednesday local time.Prime Minister Oli said he discussed Nepal-Bangladesh relations with a focus on enhancing energy and transit cooperation and boosting tourism.“Discussed Nepal-Bangladesh relations, focusing on energy and transit cooperation, tourism, cultural exchanges, educational ties and cooperation in regional/multilateral forums,” Prime Minister Oli said in a post on X.Nepal, India and Bangladesh had earlier agreed to sign an agreement on July 28 on the export of Nepal’s 40MW of electricity to Bangladesh via India.However, the scheduled event, which was suddenly deferred indefinitely due to the political change in Bangladesh, has yet to take place.Officials from the Nepal Electricity Authority (NEA), the Bangladesh Power Development Board (BPDB) and the NTPC Vidyut Vyapar Nigam Ltd (NVVN) of India were scheduled to sign the agreement at a function in Kathmandu.It was agreed that with the signing of the agreement, the NEA would export 40MW hydroelectricity to Bangladesh from June 15 to November 15 every year.Meanwhile, Alice Albright, the CEO of Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC), paid a courtesy call on the prime minister on the sidelines of the UNGA.During the meeting, various matters of bilateral interest between Nepal and the US and MCC projects in Nepal were discussed. The US government’s Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) signed a $500 million compact with the government of Nepal in September 2017. The compact aims to maintain road quality, increase the availability and reliability of electricity, and facilitate cross-border electricity trade between Nepal and India.“We look forward to early completion of the project for high-quality connectivity through transmission lines and highways,” the prime minister said in a post on X.The prime minister addressed a high-level plenary meeting to address the threats posed by rising sea levels.Addressing the meeting, the prime minister called for adoption of an integrated approach, a ‘mountain to sea’ initiative in our climate actions, recognising the inherent connections between these ecosystems.“Their coverage should span from Everest to the Indian Ocean, from the Pamirs to the Pacific, and from the Andes to the Atlantic Ocean, recognising environmental and ecological inter-linkages,” he said.Prime Minister Oli said we must take bold, decisive actions to limit the global temperature rise to 1.5°C. “This is not just a number—it is the threshold for survival,” he said.Calling for collective global effort to tackle rising sea levels, to build resilience in our nations, and to adapt to the changes, he said hand-in-hand, we must control release of pollutants that generate acidic clouds and other effects as the pristine glaciers are turning into the depository of various contaminants.“Most importantly, we must deliver climate justice. Wealthy nations must lead from the front to support vulnerable countries,” he said.Likewise, addressing a function organised by Mount Sinai Hospital and AMPATH Nepal, the prime minister said that the disparity in health services between developed and underdeveloped countries should be ended.“There is a disparity in health care and infrastructure between rich and poor countries. Due to financial constraints, the people of poor countries are not able to get easy and quality healthcare services,” he said.Similarly, the prime minister called for global climate justice, urging major carbon-emitting nations to take responsibility for their contributions to climate change.Speaking at the Climate Vulnerable Forum (CVF) Leaders Meeting during the 79th session of the UNGA, Oli emphasised the disproportionate impacts of climate change on vulnerable countries like Nepal.“Climate change is the defining crisis of our time. Nepal, being a country with young mountains and a least developed one, is facing increased climate-induced disasters at a greater scale and intensity,” he said.Likewise, Prime Minister Oli attended a reception hosted by US President Joe Biden.Prime Minister Oli joined the heads of state and government of different countries participating in the UNGA at the reception held at the Metropolitan Museum of Arts in New York.  \nWith the major festivals just around the corner, the Kathmandu Metropolitan City started market monitoring on Thursday. The move aims to discourage traders from creating artificial shortages of goods, engaging in black marketing, and selling expired food items.“We have planned to monitor 10,000 grocery shops operating in the 32 wards of the metropolis,” said Nurnidhi Neupane, chief of the metropolis’s Department of Agriculture and Animal Husbandry. “We have deployed three teams of metropolis staffers for market inspection.”Market monitoring is a regular task of local bodies, which they generally carry out during major festivals. In addition to local bodies like the Kathmandu Metropolitan City, the Department of Commerce, Supplies, and Consumer Protection also conducts inspections, especially in main cities like Kathmandu Valley.“We have trained our staffers for market inspection and counselled them not to harass traders, and have also cautioned them not to get involved in illegal practices,” Neupane said. “We hope that market inspection will prevent illegal activities and that consumers will also be aware of their rights and complain to agencies concerned if anyone cheats on them.”The city office said that traders must keep a price list of the goods before their shops open for customers; metropolis staffers will compare the prices mentioned in the list with those of the goods, storage place, and goods’ expiry date, among other things.Consumer spending during festive seasons increases manifold, and chances they get swindled also remain high.Consumer rights activists say market inspections should be done year-round to protect the rights of consumers.“Every year during festive seasons, concerned authorities carry out market inspection, which is not new,” said Bishnu Timalsina, general secretary of the Forum for Protection of Consumer Rights. “Had they inspected the market throughout the year or made market inspection a routine job, they should not have done so now with much fanfare.”Experts say that, in addition to inspecting the grocery shops, concerned authorities must inspect the source of goods, the quality of food, the price at the time of import, and the market price, among other things.“Consumers in our country are also not aware,” said Timalsina. “Consumers should be made aware of their rights.”The city office also deploys veterinary inspectors to monitor the health conditions of animals, especially goats, mountain goats, sheep, hens, buffalos and pigs during Dashain. \nNDRRMA issued a monsoon alert warning of heavy rainfall and monsoon-related hazards in 32 districts across all 7 provinces, urging precautions including travel restrictions, harvest precautions, and safety measures for flood-prone and landslide-prone areas.\nWaling Municipality and Koshi Province secure spots in ANFA Women's League Super League, while Sudurpaschim Province crash out without a win.\n**Concise Event Summary:** Key events transpire, including a **[Event 1]** leading to **[Event 2]** and culminating in **[Event 3]**.\n\"War, revolution, economic crises, technological advancements, political upheavals, and social transformations reshape societies from inception to present.\"\nNepal's spring and autumn trekking season offers stunning treks to Annapurna Base Camp, Manaslu Circuit, Tsum Valley, Upper Mustang, Dudh Pokhari, and Kanchenjunga, showcasing breathtaking mountains, vibrant cultures, and unforgettable experiences.\nThe displacement of thousands of families in Shuklaphanta National Park has highlighted the recurring problem of inadequate rehabilitation efforts in Nepal, with displaced people facing ongoing vulnerabilities and insufficient government assistance, despite numerous commissions formed to address the issue.\nBang on the banks of the Mechi River, Bahundangi gets in the news each time elephants “wreak havoc” in the village in eastern Jhapa, on the border with the Darjeeling Terai. To anyone following the episodic news outside the village, and in Kathmandu, the elephants are intruders from India, wild beasts with very little regard for human lives and livelihoods. The story is a little more complex than that. In the age of social media, the elephant menace gets ever so magnified. Short videos show villagers running helter-skelter: Helpless men, women and young children trying to chase the elephants away from their homes and crops howsoever they can. The human-animal conflict is never an easy sight. When the elephants then enter the neighbouring east Bihar, local communities in India similarly hold that the tusker trouble has its origin in Nepal. Most of these stories are reported as isolated events; so are the solutions that come into play. Villagers try to chase the elephants away from human settlements and keep vigil to bar them from re-entering their neighbourhoods. In 2016, the National Trust for Nature Conservation (NTNC), with support from the World Bank, constructed an 18-kilometre fence in Bahundangi, right by the Mechi River. But the electric fences can never offer a one-stop solution. Over time, elephants—among the most intelligent animals—find ways to circumvent them. Often, the fence is washed away by floods—as some 300 metres of it in the current monsoon in Bahundangi. In some cases, the solar-powered battery panels are stolen, which can render the fence useless. In all this, the only concern for many local government officials—the CDOs, Chief District Officers; and the DFOs, District Forest Officers in Chandragadhi, for instance—is to hush it all up. To them, the news of elephant attacks or elephants in distress should not travel to Kathmandu. Why face a new set of controversies, get caught up in the Centre-grassroots contest and invite needless enquiries? Any initiative that especially requires cross-border cooperation with Indian officials is even more complicated. What attracts the elephantsElephants can smell maize from miles away and farmers in Jhapa grow plenty of it. Various hybrid varieties now grow abundantly round the year, very unlike earlier when it used to be a seasonal crop. On the other hand, the Darjeeling Terai and further east, the Dooars, are studded with large tea gardens—among the world’s largest. Elephants don’t eat tea plants, but the tea gardens along the foothills of the Himalaya are havens for elephants in their long migration routes in the plains of Bengal, southern Bhutan and Assam.The elephant corridors in eastern Nepal and north Bengal, on the Indian Chicken Neck, are crucial conduits for their movements. The Mahananda-Kolabari corridor links the forests of Bengal to Nepal. However, as water holes, grass, and trees get scarce, elephants venture into human settlements in search of food and water.Further, as the temperatures warm up due to global warming, elephant sightings have been reported at higher elevations in Ilam, which borders the Darjeeling Hills. Among the wild elephants spotted in the elephant corridor in Jhapa, Morang and Sunsari, some are local herds (raithaney), which have been found to stay there for extended periods.Borderland and nonstate actorsBahundangi notably is in the borderland. Family and kinship ties, and businesses are spread across the border to Panitanki, Siliguri, Darjeeling and beyond. When elephants create menace and run into trouble in the settlements close to the Nepal-India border, it is the Rapid Response Team that springs into action, often in the middle of the night. Its members are residents of local communities on either side of the border river. The locals are in the line of fire, and they are the ones who get into immediate action. Kathmandu, Biratnagar and even Chandragadhi are distant administrative capitals. In north Bengal, adjacent to eastern Jhapa, the elephant habitat lies in Darjeeling Terai and Jalpaiguri districts. The elephant population extends from the Teesta River char (sand and silt islands in the river formed by floods) through Mahananda Wildlife Sanctuary and southern forests of Kurseong Division, up to Bahundangi, observes Jayanta Mallick in ‘Trans-boundary human-elephant conflict in the Indo-Nepal Terai landscape’. Increasingly, the landscape, interspersed with human habitations, has become an extensive human-elephant conflict zone in terms of human mortality, crop depredations and loss of properties. In Nepal, elephant populations are concentrated in four places. Bahundangi is the transit point for migration in the east. Nepal has enlisted elephants as protected species under the National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act, 1973 and is among the 13 Asian elephant range states.A ‘mega-herbivore,’ elephants have long-range dispersing behaviour, frequently coming into contact with human beings in the course of their movement. Although their poaching is not a threat in Nepal, according to the National Trust for Nature Conservation (NNTC), elephant conservation is challenged by habitat fragmentation, obstruction of migratory routes and human-elephant conflict. Though the challenge of elephant conservation has been documented in academic essays and journals, its cross-border nuances are not much discussed in the public sphere. Elephants as far away as Assam migrate to Nepal, passing through the plains of Darjeeling. In the process, they pass through human settlements, where they damage houses and crops, kill humans and get killed themselves too.Without a cross-border conservation regime and recognition of the role of non-state actors, such as the Rapid Response Team in Bahundangi and Naxalbari in north Bengal, the human-animal conflict will continue to be grossly misunderstood.   \nOnly one in three 10-year-olds worldwide can understand a simple paragraph or story in their own language. It’s a shocking figure to many, who assume the world has moved beyond problems of literacy and completion rates in schooling. But in reality, childhood illiteracy (or ‘learning poverty’) is as high as 92 percent in low-income countries. And while it’s lower—as low as 8 percent—in high-income countries, the overall rate of learning poverty among young people is a staggering 64 percent globally. What’s more, education is grossly underfunded across the globe. High-income countries account for just 10 percent of the children in the world, but get 63 percent of global public investment. Low-income countries have 25 percent of the children in the world, but receive only a fraction of 1 percent of global public investment in education.Currently, the majority of the kids in the world do not have access to high-quality education. They will never develop their potential to contribute to sustainability, equity, good governance and the economy—the four dimensions of sustainable development. This is an alarming state of affairs. But there are relatively simple ways to address the problem.Walk the talkThe United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) specifically focus on quality education (goal 4). Within that goal, specific targets aim to go beyond literacy, as well as science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) to embed green education, global citizenship and skills of the future into education at all levels.Almost all UN member states have agreed to try to achieve the SDGs by 2030. That means the vast majority of world governments have theoretically pledged to work towards educational excellence for all—with the deadline looming just six years from now. But while we dream of achieving these targets, in reality we’re still struggling with getting kids to read, write and understand maths and science. Even in high income countries that tend to be strong in literacy and STEM, their non-STEM skills and environmental education are still very weak.We are starting from a low base with regard to sustainable development education. The world needs a surge in investment, innovation and capacity to ensure that every child, even in the poorest countries, is given the opportunity for a decent education that, in turn, promotes peace and a sustainable future for all.Last September, all UN member states committed to “continue increasing investment in inclusive and equitable quality education and life-long learning opportunities for all” at the Political Declaration from the Mid-Point Review of the SDGs, co-facilitated by the Irish and Qatari Governments.International cooperation and collective action are needed more than ever. But our existing systems of cooperative, cross-border (“multilateral”) engagement were not designed for the complex, interconnected and rapidly changing world in which we live. It is time for the UN to revitalise multilateralism for a sustainable future.To support this vision, the UN Summit of the Future, which is taking place in New York this week, will consider a Pact of the Future that includes a chapter on Youth and Future Generations, alongside four other chapters. That chapter on Youth and Future Generations outlines key themes of intergenerational responsibility, fulfilling present demands while safeguarding the interests of future generations and investment in a global transformation of education.This Pact also pledges: “We will invest in the social and economic development of children and young people so they can reach their full potential.” This statement puts governments under pressure to provide sustainable development and global citizenship education to preschool, K-12, higher education, professional development and vocational training.SDG4 can be the great enabler of all the SDG transformations to achieve peace and sustainable development. In financial terms, education is also the low-hanging fruit. Universal access to education is the one goal that’s probably the cheapest to achieve and relatively easier to do, but somehow it falls down the agenda. It doesn’t get funded.What’s stopping investment?First, many countries do not mandate that everyone goes to school. In a low-income country living off rain-fed farming, the decision can be to go to school or contribute to household food security. In high-income countries, households want STEM skills to secure jobs. Children are not trained in the skills of the future: the ability to work in teams, adapt to new technology and have empathy for other people and nature.What’s more, governments need capital for long-term investments in education. But governments can work in five-year political cycles, while investing in education is perhaps a 20-year plan. So, it is difficult for them to commit to investing in education, even though it’s the most important investment a government can make.Many countries in the northern hemisphere have access to bond markets and can borrow over 30-year cycles at very cheap interest rates to invest in building schools, training facilities and developing new curricula. But many countries cannot access these bond markets. Instead, they may rely on loans from intergovernmental banks, where debt repayments are high over shorter terms. Allowing access to bond markets and cheap financing over long periods would fundamentally change the face of education financing for the better.Domestic taxes cannot always be relied on to fund investment in education. Middle-to low-income countries have small tax bases. Governments need to build roads and ensure food and energy security and they just don’t have much money left over for education. Nevertheless, many countries could do more, even those with low tax bases.UNESCO recommends states increase expenditure on education to about 20 percent or commit 4 to 6 percent of GDP to education. Poor countries will still have a gap that could be filled by richer countries out of moral duty and self-interest to secure a safe planet for future generations. Currently, the world is not even close to ensuring funding of full participation with good learning outcomes through K-12 into university and beyond.A global investment fund in education can put the world on a pathway that generates more economic activity, equity and sustainability for all.-360info \nEvery year, on the eve of Dashain, Tihar and Chhath, the triumvirate of Nepal’s biggest festivals, market prices shoot up, shadowing the festive mood. This year too, the prices of essential goods such as rice, edible oil, legumes and lentils are already soaring. To make matters worse, both long-range buses and airlines hike ticket prices, making the journey home a financial burden for many. Goods prices are really not consumer-friendly. Even the supposedly low-cost goods from China are now out of reach of many families. Let us not even get started on the price of gold, which only the super-rich can now afford. While it is natural for international trends to influence market prices, the bigger problem in Nepal are opportunistic traders and middlemen who are freely fleecing consumers in the absence of proper market supervision. Take the recent price hike in edible oil. When India, Nepal’s all-important trade partner, increased the basic import tax on crude and edible oils by 25 percent, Nepali importers seized on the opportunity to increase the price of edible oil, even when the government of Nepal had not increased its import taxes on oil. As a result, sunflower oil, which was Rs190 a litre last week, is now being sold at Rs210 a litre; mustard oil, which was going at Rs350 a litre, now costs Rs370 for the same amount. Rice prices have also increased by an average of Rs100kg (for a 25 kg bag). In the next few weeks, the prices could get steeper still. In response, the government has started operating fair-priced shops across the country to help people tide over festive times. However, such festival-time intervention will not be enough to stop unscrupulous businesses from arbitrarily setting prices. Only if there is periodic monitoring of the market will the effort seem credible and businesses take it seriously. Moreover, according to consumer rights activists, just inspecting retail markets is not enough. To prevent unscrupulous trade, the warehouses of larger importers and traders where goods are stocked for supply must also come under regular inspections.Then there is the matter of added travel costs. Domestic flight fares rise due to increased demand during festivals. For instance, the usual one-way airfare for Kathmandu-Dhangadhi is Rs7,900, but travellers will have to pay Rs13,300 between October 10-12 this year. Those who book tickets ahead of time get to travel on the standard fare, but those in emergencies are bound to suffer. Travel via the roads is another concern during festivals as the transport management department, which has issued directives for safe and comfortable travel, has refused to increase the number of passenger buses. This has allowed the current bus operators to overcharge passengers. Ease of travel is a basic right and it cannot be solely left to the logic of supply and demand, especially during the festive times when all people long to be with their loved ones. Several studies, including one by the National Consumer Forum, a consumer rights body, reckon Nepal’s market is comparably more expensive than markets of similar economies. Festive time or not, only year-round market monitoring, intervention and penalties for scrupulous operators can ease the growing financial burden on people.  \nThe Indian government has slashed its goal to create thousands of new tribunals to try sex crimes speedily after states like West Bengal, where the recent brutal rape-homicide of a doctor shook the nation, fell far short of targets, according to three federal government officials and an internal document seen by Reuters.Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government moved to establish fast-track special courts (FTSC) in 2019 to try exclusively sex crimes, after the Supreme Court that year criticised state governments for being slow to deliver justice to victims. The court singled out Bengal and Uttar Pradesh for taking too long to reach judgment on cases involving child victims.Most sex crimes are tried by India’s heavily burdened state courts, but Modi’s government planned to incentivise state governments to establish 1,023 FTSCs by March 2021 by funding 60% of costs. Each FTSC is staffed by one judicial officer and seven support staff.The government had projected 2,600 FTSCs by 2026 but has now revised its target to 790 due to low interest from states and a lack of judges, according to the officials and the document, an undated summary from this year of progress on the FTSC project.Just 752 FTSCs have been established nationwide as of August, according to publicly available government data.Some states were slow to sign up to the project, with Bengal only joining last year. The opposition-led state - whose chief minister Mamata Banerjee is under scrutiny for her handling of sex crimes - was earlier set a target of 123 fast-track tribunals by March 2021, according to the officials and the document.A Japanese man who was convicted of murder more than sixty years ago was exonerated on Thursday after a retrial.But only six tribunals are operational in Bengal, where there are some 48,600 cases of rape and other sexual offences pending judgement.Details of the federal government’s original target and its decision to scale back sharply are reported by Reuters for the first time.Top West Bengal judicial bureaucrat Siddhartha Kanjilal blamed the slow response on a lack of judges but said authorities were working with the Calcutta High Court, its top tribunal, on appointing retired officials to FTSCs.“There have been delays,” he said. “We, as well as the Calcutta High Court, are seized of the matter.”The Indian Law and justice ministry and the office of Banerjee, a vocal critic of Modi, did not respond to requests for comment.Bengal has now been set a goal of 17 special tribunals by 2026, according to the undated government document and a second August 30 summary on the status of FTSCs in that eastern state seen by Reuters.India's strained judicial system has a backlog of tens of millions of cases. State courts of first instance are short of about 5,000 judicial officers, roughly 20% of the judges they have been allocated by state authorities, government data show.In one notable instance of delay, a district court in Ajmer this August sentenced six men to life imprisonment for their role in mass rapes that occurred in the early 1990s.One of the Ajmer victims, who cannot be named under Indian law, said she was abandoned by her husband after he learned of the assault and the sentence from a traditional court had come way too late for her: “I am of a grandmother’s age now and have no expectations or hope left.”By contrast, FTSCs focus on specific crimes and can try them speedily. They are also allowed to hire judges on contract, including retired judicial officers.In 2022, the last year for which comprehensive data is available, FTSCs passed judgement on 83% of cases on the docket. By contrast, Indian courts overall ruled on just 56% of the sex-crime cases taken on that year.The original FTSC targets were set by the federal law and justice ministry using a formula that took into account the number of outstanding cases in each state and a target for each tribunal to conclude 165 cases annually, one of the officials said. Like his colleagues, the official spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorised to talk to media.In a country where cases can drag on, FTSCs “have particular relevance in cases involving vulnerable victims and witnesses,” said G.S. Bajpai, vice chancellor of the National Law University Delhi, who has advised the government on criminal law reforms.Senior lawyer Shobha Gupta, who has represented many rape victims, said FTSCs can be useful but that appeals still go through the slow traditional court system.“What is needed is fast tracking until the last court and final verdict and execution of the final verdict in a strict time-bound manner,” she said.There is no publicly available data on how many FTSC cases are appealed but two of the government officials said it was common for sentences from lower courts and tribunals to be appealed. Nearly 42% of the 1.7 million criminal cases pending in India’s high courts are appeals.BLAME GAME?Opposition-led states have generally been slower to set up FTSCs, according to government data.Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan, both ruled by Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party, have met their targets, according to the three officials and justice department data.But the western state of Maharashtra, governed by a coalition that includes the BJP, has only established 14 of its target 138.The three officials said the federal government had repeatedly urged laggard states like Bengal to sign up, but often received no response.The August 30 summary seen by Reuters said the justice department had written to Bengal on December 12, 2023, advising it to hire contractual staff “in the event of an insufficient workforce.”In 2021, then-minister of law Kiren Rijiju also wrote a letter to Banerjee, seen by Reuters, in which he said his department had sent previous reminders seeking her consent to establish FTSCs.The three officials said they received no response to the letters.One opposition-ruled state that has met its target of 22 FTSCs is Jharkhand.But the state of 33 million has since told the federal government it will pull out of the FTSC program, the three officials said.Jharkhand’s top law bureaucrat Rajesh Sharan Singh said officials have been conferring about running FTSCs that are entirely funded by the state, one of the poorest in India, but declined to say why.“If the state government funds it, we will exit the central government funding,” he said.Chief Minister Hemant Soren’s office didn’t respond to Reuters’ questions. \nThe Meteorological Forecasting Division has forecast the weather to be generally to mostly cloudy throughout the country on Friday.Light to moderate rain with thunder, lightning and gusty wind is likely to continue at many places of Koshi, Madesh, Bagmati, Gandaki and Lumbini Province and at some places of the rest of the province.There is a chance of heavy rainfall at some places of the Koshi, Madesh, Bagmati, Gandaki and Lumbini Provinces and at a few places of Karnali and Sudur Pashchim Province.Tonight the weather is forecast to be generally to mostly cloudy throughout the country.Light to moderate rain with thunder, lightning and gusty wind is likely to continue at many places of Bagmati, Gandaki, Lumbini and Sudur Pashchim Province and at some places of the rest of the provinces. Bagmati, Gandaki and Lumbini Province as well as a few places of the rest of the country are likely to experience heavy to very heavy rainfall.With the high-alert warning for heavy to extreme rainfall across all seven provinces, NDRRMA has requested to take precautionary steps including travel restrictions like halting the night bus services in high-risk hilly and mountainous districts on September 27 and 28.On Thursday, Dhangadi recorded the highest maximum temperature at 33.8°C, while Okhaldhunga experienced the lowest minimum temperature at 19.5°C. Biratnagar registered the highest rainfall at 61.4 mm, followed by Dhankuta with 38.1 mm and Dipayal with 35.5 mm \nWhen five-year-old Dorjee Karmarong caught a cold, his family took him to a traditional doctor who was also a Thangka painter. As a playful gesture, the doctor told young Dorjee that he would recover if he promised to become an artist.Many years later, Karmarong kept that promise. His works are currently on display at the Siddhartha Art Gallery in an exhibition titled ‘Karmarong: Hidden Valley in the Himalayas’, showcasing 27 paintings. These paintings show the culture and lifestyle of Karmarong Rural Municipality, located in the Mugu district of Karnali Province. When asked about his motivation to create art, Karmarong explains, “It feels like we, the Karmarong people, lack a distinct identity. Perhaps it's because those who should see us haven’t, or those who should acknowledge us have failed. Even the Nepal government has yet to recognise the Karmarong community.”He adds, “As the national anthem says, ‘Sayun thunga fulka hami eeutai maala Nepali,’ meaning many flowers in one garland. We are such flowers. Our culture is unique, and we have contributed to Nepal’s heritage. We aspire to enhance Nepal’s beauty through our culture and make it even more remarkable.”“The purpose behind creating these artworks is to let people know about the Karmarongs,” Karmarong explains. In his book ‘Ways of Seeing’, John Berger emphasises the importance of understanding the historical and cultural context in which a piece of art is created. Rightly so, to truly appreciate Dorjee’s work, one must first understand the culture of the Karmarong people. The artist has made this possible in two ways. First, he has published a book detailing the geographical and cultural nuances of the Karmarong community. Second, he conveys this through his artwork.As the saying goes, “a picture speaks louder than words,” Dorjee’s paintings do just that. They poignantly capture everyday scenes and tell stories of the Karmarong people. His art reflects their customs, traditions, and way of life, offering cultural insight.Having spent his childhood surrounded by lush green landscapes and serene rivers, Karmarong’s artwork is also a testament to his early experiences in nature. His work embodies ecological aesthetics, showcasing the beauty of the natural world.“Many people overlook the small details in Thangka art. Through this solo exhibition, I’ve aimed to highlight the unrecorded stories of the Karmarong people—their history, culture, and religious practices—by bringing them into the public eye,” he says.As you enter the gallery, an artwork of a family of three captures your attention. My conversation with Karmarong, especially about the journey that shaped him into the artist he is today, became essential to understanding the significance of this piece.The painting of the family, dressed in traditional Tibetan attire, shows the mother carrying a doko, with the father and son walking behind her. This scene symbolises Karmarong’s childhood and reflects his parents’ experiences as rural migrant workers. They would trek on foot over the mountains from Koskar, Himachal Pradesh, back to their village in western Nepal.The following artworks form a series connecting Karmarong to his childhood in the village. Through these pieces, he skillfully presents an autobiographical depiction of his early years, using personal iconography to explore and express his formative experiences.Another feature of the artwork is the portrayal of yaks. Influenced by the Karmarong people's strong belief in Dharma and Karma, the yaks, depicted carrying goods on their backs, symbolise how these spiritual principles extend beyond humans, even guiding and influencing the lives of animals.Inspired by his childhood experiences, Karmarong created a piece titled ‘The Yak and His Young Keeper’. This artwork reflects his journey of learning Thangka art during his apprenticeship with Master Palden, where he mastered the geometric principles of Tibetan iconography. As Palden’s student, Dorjee also learned to blend modern styles with traditional Thangka techniques, allowing him to innovate and express himself more freely in his art. Two of his abstract paintings showcase these traits. The first, titled ‘The Dance of Elements’, incorporates the five elements of nature and features a monstrous face split into orange and black hues. Its pink hand clutches a cigarette-like object coiled by snakes.When asked about his interpretation of the artwork, Karmarong explained that it reflects nature's duality: its beauty and peril. He emphasised that mismanaging our natural resources can lead to destruction. The depiction of various wild animals and bombs serves as a reminder of the consequences of our actions toward nature. Similarly, his other painting, ‘The Beauty of a Flawed World’, features geometric shapes and upside-down alphabets.“We often criticise things that aren’t arranged in a proper order. Through this painting, I want to convey that beauty can be found anywhere. Everything doesn’t need to be perfectly aligned; it’s about one’s perspective and how they view the world,” he says.Similarly, Karmarong intertwines the narratives of Buddhist and Tibetan mythologies by showcasing various monuments in his art. One feature in his paintings is a three-story structure resembling a house known as Kangni, which serves as a recurring motif. Referred to as the ‘Gate of Virtue’, this structure is built on a raised platform two meters off the ground with a mandala ceiling. The walls surrounding the Kangni illustrate the life of Lord Buddha. According to legend, when Rinpoche witnessed his daughter placing a stone in a sacred spot, he encouraged its reverence. Since that moment, people have started bowing to the stone in hopes of receiving blessings.After watching ‘Shambhala’, I couldn’t help but notice similarities between the film’s imagery and the artist’s artistic creations, particularly in the portrayal of the monastery. Hearing Karmarong narrate myth stories transports the listeners back to their childhood when the days were filled with tales and fables of the past.The exhibition also highlights the intriguing story of the monasteries' origins. The tale of Valmo Tsering narrates the myth associated with these origins. According to the legend, a she-spirit with long breasts would chase after young animal herders at the foot of a village. In response, a Lama placed two large boulders on her, resulting in her demise. To honour the Lama, the villagers constructed a monastery. Today, remnants of this site, including a stupa and parts of the old monastery, are still visible.In his artwork, Karmarong employs acrylic on cotton and a vibrant colour palette dominated by the natural hues of blue, green, and brown. The composition features a goreto bato, similar to those found in the village, allowing viewers to experience the art as if gazing at the region’s scenic landscapes. The painting instils a sense of wonder and admiration, inviting viewers to appreciate the lush greenery and natural beauty of Nepal’s often overlooked places.Moreover, the painting captures the artist’s love for his roots and heritage, showcasing his effort to bring his culture to the forefront.In this way, for over 20 years, Karmarong has painted Thangkas and exhibited his work in various countries. He also believes that his journey as an artist may be linked to Karma. A lama suggests that he may be the reincarnation of a yogi from Karmarong who struggled to find an artist to assist in constructing a monastery. The yogi had vowed to be reborn as an artist, and Karmarong deeply resonates with this story, believing that he is fulfilling the yogi’s mission in this lifetime.Therefore, his solo art exhibition is the story of a spiritual and artistic evolution. Each piece represents not only his personal growth as an artist but also the fulfilment of a karmic vow made by a yogi.Karmarong: Hidden Valley in the HimalayasWhere: Siddhartha Art Gallery, Baber MahalWhen: September 24 to October 21Time: Sunday to Friday: 11:00 am to 5:00 pm, Saturday 12:00 pm to 5:00 pmEntry: Free \n\nThe year-on-year consumer price inflation stood at 4.1 percent in mid-August compared to 7.52 percent a year ago, nearly half, as non-food and service inflation dived to just 2.94 percent.Experts say this is expected in rapidly growing low-income countries, as people with rising incomes consume more food and drive up food prices relative to the prices of other goods. According to the central bank report released on Thursday, the food and beverage inflation stood at 6.17 percent in the review month.Under the food and beverage category, the year-on-year price index of the vegetable sub-category increased 19.07 percent, pulses and legumes 12.09 percent, cereal grains and their products 9.15 percent, and milk products and eggs 3.66 percent.Nepal Rastra Bank said it updated the consumer price index (CPI) base year to 2023-24. Before this, the base year was 2014-15. In the updated consumer price index, the weight for the food and beverage group is 35.49 percent, and for the non-food and services group is 64.51 percent. In the base year 2014-15, the total weight of the food and beverage group was 43.91 percent, while the total weight of the non-food and services group was 56.09 percent.So, according to analysts, a drop in non-food and services groups pulls the overall inflation.As a result, the public doesn’t believe in the overall inflation rate worked out by the central bank as they say foods have become very expensive.“That’s a wrong statement,” said Ramu Paudel, spokesperson for the Nepal Rastra Bank. “We calculate inflation with our methodology.”Manbar Singh Khadka, an economist at the Asian Development Bank, said on Tuesday that since nearly 60 percent of Nepal’s imports are from India, the Indian price index is appropriate for comparison with Nepal’s consumer price index.“As transportation costs are added, Nepal has a slightly high inflation rate.”In India, inflation eased from 3.55 percent in July 2024 to 3.26 percent in August. In Nepal, it increased slightly, from 3.57 percent in mid-July to 4.1 percent in mid-August.Nepal has an open border with India, facilitating the free movement of goods, and a hard peg to the Indian rupee. Thus, inflation shocks from India are transmitted to Nepal through trade and exchange rate channels. Even though Nepal tries to retain domestic monetary control to some extent at the expense of financial openness, having a fixed exchange rate and an open border limits the policy's response to inflationary pressures, according to the International Monetary Fund. According to the central bank, the updated index puts alcoholic drinks, tobacco products, and restaurants and hotels in the non-food and services group in accordance with the Classification of Individual Consumption by Purpose 2018 standard.The prices of 525 items are collected from a weighted basket of 249 commodities to compute the price index. Of these, the prices of 59 items are recorded weekly, 94 monthly, and 372 quarterly.For the first time, the central bank has computed the price index at the provincial level. Eighty-seven market centres have been selected for data collection across all 77 districts, including 28 from the Tarai, 43 from the hills, and 16 from the mountain region. Among these, 21 are rural market centres while 66 are urban. These market centres number 15 in Koshi, 12 in Madhesh, 16 in Bagmati, 11 in Gandaki, 13 in Lumbini, and 10 in Karnali and Sudurpaschim.According to the new inflation data, consumer prices remain high in the Sudurpaschim province at 6.69 percent, while the Karnali province recorded the lowest at 3.46 percent in mid-July to mid-August.“As the updated index has added new goods with price data from all 77 districts, the inflation report will be more representative and inclusive,” said Paudel. “Also, the goods on the index include their consumption by all income groups.”No theory says that the inflation in the market and the inflation report of the central bank should match, Paudel argues. Before the update, the central bank collected data from 50 districts. \nPrime Minister KP Sharma Oli has stressed Nepal’s commitment to resolving its long-standing transitional justice issues.Addressing the 79th session of the United Nations General Assembly in New York, the prime minister outlined Nepal’s efforts to address the transitional justice process. “Parliament has passed a Transitional Justice bill to settle the issue once and for all,” Prime Minister Oli told the Assembly, underscoring his government’s commitment to bringing closure to the conflict era.The new law, he said, is designed to uphold victims’ rights by ensuring they receive truth and justice, while also providing a path for reconciliation.Prime Minister Oli said that reparations and reconciliation are crucial to healing the “wounds and scars” left by the conflict. “We will use reparations and reconciliation to heal the wounds and scars of the conflict period,” he said.The prime minister reaffirmed his government’s intention to expedite the peace process and secure political stability, noting that the transitional justice mechanism is central to this effort.Oli expressed appreciation for the international support Nepal has received in dealing with its transitional justice issues, including assistance from the United Nations. “We appreciate support from the international community, including the UN system, in this regard,” he said.In addition to transitional justice, Prime Minister Oli highlighted the escalating threat of climate change, which he described as one of the most pressing global challenges.He called for “climate justice” for nations like Nepal, which contribute little to global emissions but bear a disproportionate share of the consequences.Oli drew attention to the alarming rate at which Nepal’s Himalayan glaciers—often referred to as the “Third Pole”—are melting.“This loss of ice not only threatens water availability for billions of people in downstream countries but also poses a significant environmental risk, he said. “Of utmost concern is the alarming rate at which the pristine Himalayas, often referred to as the Third Pole, are losing their vast snow reserves.”The prime minister said that Nepal’s Himalayas play a critical role in regulating global climate patterns, with their snow-fed rivers flowing into major oceans and contributing to climate stability.Prime Minister Oli reiterated Nepal’s call for stronger international action on the issue, including the need for a dedicated “Loss and Damage” fund to support countries like Nepal in implementing climate-resilient measures and infrastructure.He also called for greater focus on the mountain agenda in international climate negotiations, pointing out that Nepal’s mountainous regions are vital not only for the local population but for the global ecosystem.“Nepal’s Himalayas, as a natural climate stabiliser, help maintain a cooling system in a region situated in the hottest zone of the planet,” he said, urging global leaders to pay greater attention to the unique challenges faced by mountainous nations in the fight against climate change.Reaffirming Nepal’s commitment to the Paris Agreement, Oli outlined the country’s target to achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2045, five years ahead of the global goal. “Nepal is steadfast in its commitment to the Paris Agreement and aims to achieve net zero by 2045,” he said, stressing that collective global efforts are required to tackle the climate crisis effectively.He also reaffirmed Nepal’s commitment to international peace, noting the country’s contributions to United Nations peacekeeping missions and its advocacy for global disarmament. \nMinister for Foreign Affairs Arzu Rana Deuba has urged the G20 member countries to increase financial support for Least Developed Countries (LDCs) to address the damaging impacts of climate change.Reflecting on the problems LDCs face due to climate change, Minister Rana said, “These countries have suffered from multi-faceted crises, including the Covid-19 pandemic, climate change, and geopolitical tensions. As a result, these countries have been pushed further into extreme poverty in the last two decades.”She was addressing the G20 Foreign Affairs Ministers Meeting in New York on Wednesday on the sidelines of the 79th Session of the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA). Minister Rana made these remarks on behalf of the Group of Least-Developed Countries, of which Nepal is the current chair.The minister urged the G20 nations to take a leading role in promoting inclusive growth, accelerating the 2030 Agenda, enhancing global health security, leading climate action, driving digital transformation, bridging digital divides, fostering multilateral cooperation, and addressing the challenges the world faces.She lauded Brazil’ s initiatives in hosting the meeting as the chair of the G20 with a focus on social inclusion, poverty alleviation and sustainable development while welcoming its proposal to launch a Global Alliance against Hunger and Poverty.Minister Rana urged the establishment of a formal mechanism for LDC representation in G20 meetings and working groups, including regular invitations for the LDC chair to G20 Summits, which she said provides a vital platform for allowing the perspectives of LDCs to shape G20 deliberations and outcomes.Likewise, she requested the establishment of a G20-led fund to support climate adaptation and resilience-building in LDCs, with a focus on grant-based financing and capacity building for project development and implementation.She also called on G20 members to provide duty-free and quota-free market access for products from all the LDC countries, which she believed would help LDCs better integrate into global venue chains and boost export revenues.She stressed the urgent need for G20 countries to recognise that LDCs have been severely hit by the recent increase in extreme poverty, calling for collective efforts to support these countries. \nDean Richard Thompson recently completed his two years as the American ambassador to Nepal. Arriving here just before the 2022 elections, he has since closely observed Nepali politics and society. Umesh Chauhan and Biswas Baral recently sat down with Thompson to reflect on his time in Nepal, major US projects in the country including those under the MCC, geopolitical competition with China, trade, and a range of other issues.How have you seen Nepali politics evolve in the two years you have been in the country? What events stood out? I’ve seen a lot of Nepali politics. Obviously, there’s been a lot of changes. I got here right before the national elections in November 2022. It was really great to see the democratic process play out here, to see Nepalis turn out in such great numbers and make their choices known.Democracy is such a vibrant and colourful exercise anywhere in the world. Nepal did not disappoint on that front. It's been fascinating to watch it evolve, to watch the governments come in different formations.What’s been great is the commitment we’ve seen from successive groups in government to moving forward and carrying forward the [bilateral] partnership and building on projects. I’ve also been amazed at some of the innovative things happening in various sectors of the economy.There has been some very exciting work in the IT sector, for example, that runs the gamut from more traditional back-office type operations to cutting-edge AI research, to developing educational apps for school students, to things like what we have been sponsoring at our Content Creator’s Mela these past two years. It is great to see Nepalis show lots of creativity in expressing themselves and talking about their culture and their society in so many different ways. Across the board, I’d say the experience has been unique.How have the Nepal-US relations evolved over the past 77 years of diplomatic ties? What are the salient features of the relationship? What I would say is we’ve always tried to listen, to engage with the Nepali society. Based on that, I think one of the things that we’ve done is refine the range of products.The Peace Corps, the USAID, the Millennium Challenge Corporation, the Development Finance Corporation, or other elements of our assistance and development commitments—these are different tools that can be employed. And Nepal has continually expanded its capacity to take advantage of them. The US has been able to increase the number of tools and assets, if you will, that Nepal can use to build its economy.I’m very proud of the fact that we have done this primarily through grant-based assistance, so that there is little in terms of downsides. At the same time, we have focused on different segments of the economy or society, for example, through the Development Finance Corporation, we’re now able to target and work with the financial sector to create more opportunities for small and medium-sized enterprises, particularly women-run enterprises. Through the USAID, we can use more of the traditional mechanisms of assistance.The Millennium Challenge Corporation kind of speaks for itself. It targets large-scale, massive infrastructure type projects that aim to be transformative in terms of Nepal’s economy. It has helped grow the road and infrastructure network and show new technology that can help expand that network and make roads safer, more reliable, and easier to maintain. It has helped build an electricity infrastructure that allows Nepal, first and foremost, to internally use the green hydropower that's at its disposal, but there will be excess capacity even to export it to the region to earn additional income. So I’m pretty excited about what I’ve seen happen over the past 77 years, and where we are today. I’m also extremely positive about building on where we are now. Can you give us a status of the implementation of projects under the Millennium Challenge Account Nepal? In the MCC, energy, obviously, is a high-priority area and so is transportation. Where we are with the projects themselves is we have let out the contracts for the sub-stations, for the 18-kilometre cross-border transmission line, and we have reissued the tender for the 297-kilometre broader transmission line package that had to be revised due to some cost changes over the time it took to implement that piece of the package.But we’re pretty positive about getting that back on track by the end of the year and putting the project firmly on the right footing for a five-year completion timeline. But there have also been hurdles, right? Do you still expect the transmission lines and road projects to be completed in five years?I expect there to be more hurdles. The biggest challenge was when the bids came back for the 297-kilometre transmission line. We had a number of delays there from Covid to worldwide inflation, to supply chain shifts that I don’t think people had foreseen completely. I’m not surprised. But the MCC has had a lot of experience around the world with these projects.It builds into this assumption that there will be challenges, there will be situations that need to be rethought and overcome. The real trick is making sure we move forward in a way that’s smart and focused on keeping things on time and on track. We're fortunate in the case of Nepal because we have a partner that has so heavily invested its own resources into the project.We have our $500 million grant and Nepal is putting in almost $200 million. It’s been made a national pride project. Look, other things will inevitably come up. But we believe that we have a good team that’s ready to tackle those types of challenges and press forward.At the end of the day, this can serve as a really positive model for how development assistance and how large-scale infrastructure projects can be implemented in a partnership that is largely the result of an internal domestic process. Don’t forget, Nepal requested the MCC project. The government of Nepal, through a consultative process, developed the idea, designed the project, and is now its lead implementer.We’re a financier and a partner but it is very much a Nepal-owned effort. Talking about challenges, there are many local governments and we have to deal with them every 10 to 15 kilometres in the project areas. Different communities have different concerns and priorities. This can add to some difficulty.What do you think will happen to the project if it cannot meet the five-year deadline?The fate of the project is to be completed in its entirety in five years. I can't speak to whether there’s going to be a particular challenge to delay it by six months or seven months or something like that. Right now, in our planning and projection, we hope that we can move it forward within the timeline.If it needs to go beyond that, we’ll work closely with our partner and figure it out. I’m confident that the $500 million that the US government is providing will be spent within the five years and it will lay a firm foundation for the completion of the project.But coming back to your scenario, indeed, you have different communities. A lot of people are affected by this. Now, on the one hand, that's why we encourage and insist on a consultative process, on everything being as transparent as possible so people know exactly what’s going to happen, that they know what the money is being spent on, what the effects will be in terms of how many trees will have to be cut down or what roads will be built where. That’s very important to us: no surprises for the communities that are out there.I think that we will rely on a lot of that effort to help us propel the project forward if things do get challenging on other fronts as well.Like you said, the project does need to be completed by a deadline of five years. Just in case it doesn’t, what happens?Look, it is an ambitious undertaking. There’s no question about it, right? And the Millennium Challenge Corporation is committed to making it happen within that five-year period. The MCA Nepal is committed to making it happen within that five-year period. But they’re also working closely together to make sure that it’s being done in a proper way, in a transparent way, and I’m confident that we will be able to complete what we need to complete. I’m also sure there’s a firm commitment from the government that if there’s a little piece left over here or there, to make sure it goes forward.I don’t worry about the ultimate completion of the project. I’m more focused on how we get it going as quickly as possible, because just the implementation of the project itself should employ close to 10,000 Nepalis, right? I really want communities to start to see the benefit of the project as soon as possible, because that’s where the transformative nature of it comes into play. Part of it is building it. Part of it is implementing it. Part of it is learning from that process. But then having this infrastructure in place, that’s what really changes the dynamic in Nepal and in the economic well-being of the country.Some fear that a failure to complete the project on time could even create rifts in our bilateral ties.I don’t think they should be fearful. We are partners in this, and if there’s any issue, if we're going to work through it together. What we should be doing is focusing entirely on implementing the project to its fullest potential as quickly as possible.Let’s move to geopolitics. What we see in the region is seemingly an exclusivist India-China geopolitical competition. Indians appear reluctant to work with the regimes that work closely with China. It's almost like they are saying, it's either the Chinese or us. How do you see this geopolitical dynamics playing out in Nepal? And where do the Americans fit in this picture?Yeah, it’s a good question in terms of the dynamic that’s in play today and where things are headed. We have of course been watching the India-China relationship and its development over the past few years with some degree of concern. Obviously, there was conflict there some years ago, and I think they’ve been trying to manage that since.And there’s no question that other countries in the region feel that very powerfully. From our standpoint, what we would like to see is the countries of the region—and particularly Nepal because that’s where I’m accredited and that’s where I have some level of knowledge—exercise their sovereignty and to have the space that they need to make decisions about they own future on behalf of their people in a positive way.We don’t believe countries should be asked to choose. We fully expect that Nepal is going to have good relations with India and China. They’re two neighbours. They’re large countries. They’re important countries in the region. It’s critically important for Nepal that it works with and benefits from both India and China.At the same time, we see no reason that should have any effect on our relationship with Nepal, and no reason Nepal should not be fully able to take full advantage of what the US has to offer. We will continue to watch and continue to work closely with Nepal as a partner and to encourage it to exercise its sovereignty and its decision-making in a way that benefits the Nepali people. The US-China relations are also very dicey at the moment. Surely this has some effect on how the US perceives the Chinese role around the world, including in Nepal.We had a recent high-level visit by our National Security Advisor [to China]. We’ve had recent visits by the Secretary of State, the Secretary of Commerce, the Secretary of Treasury. I think there’s a real effort to try to manage what we all acknowledge is as a competition that’s underway, in a way that’s positive and can maybe move us more towards some type of cooperative element.That channel should continue to be pursued by the US and China, but it’s not reflective of our relationship with Nepal, or our relationship with India. This is about what we can do together [with Nepal]. I’m not going to comment on what other countries may be saying about us, how they may be trying to influence us.I would commit to us remaining as transparent as possible so Nepalis can make their own decisions about what's happening by our relationship.Recently, the Americans were blamed for ousting Sheikh Hasina from Bangladesh. The US is also often accused of meddling in the domestic affairs of other South Asian states, and in other parts of the world for that matter. How do you respond to this accusation?First off, I think you’ve got to take with a grain of salt anything that’s being said by someone who’s been forced to flee their country. The United States simply does not meddle in the internal politics of other countries. We work very hard to be as transparent as we possibly can about our relationships, about what we’re doing, about what we intend.That’s not to say that if we disagree vehemently with a country about a certain policy or a certain issue, we won’t raise it. But this idea that the US would find some benefit in enacting a change in government like that, it simply isn’t part of our repertoire of diplomacy. What we rather look to do is build the strongest relationships that we can.We love to do that primarily through people-to-people relationships and sponsoring as much development opportunity as we possibly can with our partner countries. So, I put no stock in these types of rumours and statements.There is also this sentiment that the Americans and the Indians are increasingly working together on strategic issues, and the same is seen even in South Asia.Certainly, there’s been a huge growth in the strategic partnership between the US and India. I think we want to see that continue to move forward in a positive way. At the same time, there have been disagreements between the US and India on various fronts, just as we have disagreements with many of our partners. And we try to deal with those in a proactive, professional and productive way.But, again, we see our relationship with each individual country through a bilateral lens. So if there are ways that the US and India working together can be beneficial, and another country agrees to such a cooperation, fine. But when it comes to Nepal, we’re going to base our relationship and our efforts first and foremost on our bilateral discussions and our bilateral relationship.Even as we speak, the US and Nepali armies are undertaking joint training in Nepal. How would you characterise the relations between the two armies?Yeah, the PAC ANGEL exercise is going on, focused on disaster relief, humanitarian assistance. The relationship between the two militaries has been strong, it remains strong, and I think it will continue to be strong primarily because we focus it on the areas Nepal wants to focus on—which is building a Nepal army that is capable of responding to disasters, providing humanitarian assistance, and then serving as part of the global peacekeeping network through the United Nations as the largest contributor force of peacekeepers. It’s in our interest to see Nepal continue to professionalise and develop its capacity on those fronts. That’s where our focus is, and that’s where we will continue to make efforts.There has also been a lot of debate in Nepal on the Indo-Pacific Strategy (IPS) and its applicability to South Asia. What is the current state of its application?The Indo-Pacific Strategy is a broad, big strategy by the United States government about how it looks at the entire region. And so it’s about how we create an open, independent, sovereign Indo-Pacific region for the benefit of all the people in the region.What we will continue to do is employ it to build relationships we have with each of the countries in the region. How can we continue to support democratic development? How can we continue to support economic development? Let’s not forget a huge portion, maybe 60 percent of the world’s commerce transits the Indo-Pacific corridor in some way, shape, or form every year.It’s in everyone’s interest for that to remain open and free. And for the countries of the region to be able to act in a sovereign way in their own interests.There is also a sizable section of Nepalis who believe that the IPS was brought with the intent of countering China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), and that Nepal is struggling to find a balance between the two. What is your reading?The USAID, the MCC, the Development Finance Corporation, all of our development programmes have a singular purpose, which is to work with our bilateral partners to grow their economies, to make them more able to meet the needs of their people. That’s the goal. That's how they were designed. And that’s how we will continue to treat them.The BRI is China's initiative. It’s pushing that forward. It’s up to each country to decide how it wants to engage with others. We believe the model of, say, a USAID or an MCC is proving itself to be beneficial to countries, as they are grant-based and economic growth oriented. We’ll continue to push them because we think the data and historical experience we’ve had support them.I think it’s incumbent on us to try to help all of our partners relate to us as equals in any realm that we’re working together. That’s critically important and something we have to acknowledge and something we have to make sure that they’re able to acknowledge.It's about building trust, about showing that our intent is correct, that we have the best interest of our partners in mind, and that we’re applying the same and transparent standards universally.For example, on the MCC, we’ve published everything on the internet. If anybody in Nepal has a question about any aspect of the project, they can go to the website, they can read about the project, they can see the blueprints, they can know exactly what it’s going to involve. That's how I think we build relationships.I think if I came to Nepal and said, hey, I want to do X project because I want to counter this country, I don’t think I would get very good reception. We just don’t look at the world that way. It’s not a healthy approach in the long run.But a bilateral focus that seeks to empower the people of a country—that’s where I think we have the best chance of moving forward. Nepal’s Parliament has finally passed an amendment to the transitional justice law. How does the US see this development? How do you see the transitional justice process progressing?I think this is a really important step in the process. I would say that we remain positive about the way it's going and we are looking to see how we can help. You noted, I’m sure, that we joined a number of other partner countries in issuing a statement of support after the Parliament passed it.We all know bringing a conflict of this scale to conclusion is always going to be a challenge. The TJ legislation has passed, which was a tough hurdle, but implementation will also be difficult.We’re looking forward to figuring out how we can be supportive, and how other partners can be supportive. Some of that may be through bilateral means. Some of it may be through multilateral means.But what I remain encouraged about, in particular, is, we’ve always said this needs to be a Nepali-run process. It has been. That it needs to be victim-centric. I believe that it is. And so we need to make sure the consultative piece of this remains alive as you move to implementation, so that the victims groups, so that the child soldier groups, so that other entities that have been involved continue to have a voice and continue to work together to figure out how to resolve this, to make reparations work, to bring justice in those cases. And so, we are positive.Thousands of Nepali youths are leaving the country every single day in search of better jobs. In this light, do you see the prospect of greater American FDI helping Nepal build a more robust economy that can create enough good jobs?I do. At the beginning of the interview, I talked about some sectors of the economy that are quite exciting right now. I think you’re seeing a lot of interest from the US in the IT sector, the tourism sector, in the health sector, and in the energy sector as it continues to develop.We’re very keen to look for ways to bring more US investment here, whether it’s through equity sort of vehicles, or direct bilateral investments. I think that can also be positive. I think Nepal did a good job in setting up that April Investment Summit. That sent a really positive signal. You’ll recall that we had a representative from the US Chamber of Commerce, Atul Keshap, come out for that. We’ve had a great run of senior US visitors out here over the last year and a half.I think the key right now is for Nepal, through its private sector, through its government, to figure out how to make the environment for investment in Nepal as attractive as it can possibly be. In this interview, we’ve talked about the idea of competition between countries. One place where I will absolutely acknowledge there’s competition is in trying to attract investment.And so Nepal needs to figure out how to make itself as attractive as possible, and how to make it as easy as possible to do business. That helps not only investments that come from other countries, but makes it easier for Nepalis to start businesses, right? It makes it easier for Nepalis to operate and do what they want. And so, in addition to welcoming, say, US companies or British companies or Canadian companies, we would also love to see Nepalis who have gone abroad come back and start to help in building the economy here.We’ve seen how capable and how dynamic they are in building other people’s economies. Let’s do the same here at home.I mentioned that the trade and investment framework talks that we have with Nepal are in their seventh round. I look forward to, in the rest of my tenure here, to continue to build the momentum that will allow investment to take shape and the economy here to thrive. \nHere’s what Prime Minister KP Oli told the parliament on Monday, saying he was giving the address for a “special” reason: “Nepal wants to maintain neighbourly relations as a good neighbour, not a petty, scheming neighbour…Nepal wants a similar behaviour on the part of its neighbours.”He pursued this line of argument, implying that India is wishing ill on Nepal, imposing on Nepal’s sovereignty and interfering in its independent status and policy. He then told the parliament that he would present the issue at the United Nations General Assembly.It basically amounts to saying he will complain to the UN about India’s behaviour. What a petty idea.Given his inherent character trait, PM Oli will find it difficult to develop trusted relations with India in the short term. His only option is to be diplomatic, predictable and consistent. So far, he’s not been able to do that. It does not bode well for Nepal’s foreign policy, which is the most important means of pursuing Nepal’s current priorities, including jobs, growth and climate change.Calculated relations Oli’s statement in the parliament indicates at least three things. First, his expectations from India have not been fulfilled. Second, his communications with the country have broken down. And third, he thinks India may be working to undermine his political authority.Let’s look at his expectations from the southern neighbour. Oli wants to hold high-level talks with PM Modi of India and build trusted relations.In the past two weeks, media reports and opinion pieces have discussed whether Oli would be invited to India or not. It has almost become customary in Nepal for a new prime minister to visit India first before embarking on other high-level visits. Such a custom indicates the value politicians accord to India, especially if they want their government to be stable.The second indication is that Oli is finding it difficult to communicate with people who matter in India. When you begin to communicate your feelings about India through the media, it indicates that your direct communications have either broken down or are ineffective.Behind Oli’s statement is an obvious intention to play the blame game or rally the public. India may be at fault for many things, but blaming India does not absolve him of inconsistencies on his part or the sheer inability to conduct diplomacy in a dignified manner.The third indication is even more significant. Oli has consistently promoted anti-Indian nationalism, and India finds it difficult to trust him. But would that alone be enough to undermine his government?Throughout history, India has had a significant influence on Nepal’s political process and decision-making. Through its influence on individuals who’ve received gifts, benefits, and resources, some at the highest levels, India holds significant leverage over political decision-making and, by extension, over policies and processes.An old playbookIndia’s calculated relations with the Nepali state came to the fore in August this year when Foreign Minister Arzu Rana Deuba visited India. New Delhi turned her visit into a high-profile affair even though she was unprepared to represent Nepal’s interests. Her visit, rather than building political trust, ended up creating more mistrust between Oli and New Delhi as well as between the Foreign Ministry and the Prime Minister’s Office.Although it is a matter of speculation, there are strong grounds to argue that such a courtesy would not have been extended to someone from the CPN (UML). It generates the question, at least in the public’s mind, whether India accorded special treatment to FM Rana as a “special” individual who happened to be the foreign minister and not as a representative of Nepal.Whether real or not, the perception that India is unhappy with Oli has fuelled the notion that the current government coalition is unstable.Throughout Nepal’s modern history, whenever top leaders are forced out, they tend to seek India’s support to regain power. I have heard firsthand from top political leaders that India used to put a pre-condition: First, demonstrate that you have people's support, then we will use our leverage to help you. Thus, the political leaders would launch a political campaign and hold mass meetings throughout the country. If the broader political environment favoured a political change, then India made the additional push.Now, as Pushpa Kamal Dahal tours the country, blaming a corrupt network of power brokers, we are reminded of this old playbook. During mass meetings, an embittered Dahal frequently alleges that “middlemen, brokers, and big cronies have gotten together, and with the strength of so-called numbers, have tried to strangle truth, justice…and good governance.” He also tells the public that his government was ousted because the investigations on corruption were leading to Budhanilkantha (Deuba’s residence) and Balkot (Oli’s residence).Oli’s inherent anti-Indian streakFor Oli, an inherent anti-Indian streak in his psychological make-up and an affinity with the Communist Party of China makes rapprochement with India difficult.In the last 10 years, Oli has made countless petty statements intended to rile and irritate India. He has also accorded China greater space in Nepal.In his book, former deputy PM Kamal Thapa expresses distaste at the way Oli made an unscheduled visit to China Gezhouba Group Corporation and disappeared for one and a half hours for a private meeting with Chinese Communist Party officials during his visit to China in 2016.Another issue is the Eminent Persons’ Group report, which Oli raised during the launch of Thapa’s book. “It would be good to receive the report,” he said during the programme. He made more anti-Indian remarks at another similar event.At present, any talk of the EPG report is viewed as an irritant by India, because it has consistently sent a clear diplomatic message that the report is dead. The unwillingness of a section of the Nepali populace to accept the message, including the CPN-UML, has not gone well in India.In a recent discussion programme, a former ambassador of India to Nepal indicated that the EPG report had become a new irritant in Nepal-India relations. He said that instead of insisting on the acceptance of the report, Nepal could pursue the individual issues identified. Trends in the last two decades indicate that instead of really trying to address the outstanding issues in Nepal-India relations, Nepali leaders are just interested in politicising them and gaining personal mileage.Nepal’s relationship with India has become more and more of a paradox. Nepal’s dominant ethno-nationalism is anti-Indian. Indeed, Nepal has many unresolved issues with India, but it’s economic development hinges on closer connectivity with India, which in turn hinges on trusted political relationships and ability to untangle complex issues.Snubbed by India, Oli is now headed to the US, where he could still get to meet a lukewarm Modi. He hopes to gain stature and make an impression at several forums including the UNGA, where he is scheduled to deliver speeches. We can only wish our PM well. \n\nOn September 1, on the final day of the Nepali Congress Central Working Committee meeting, General Secretary Bishwa Prakash Sharma explicitly urged Sher Bahadur Deuba, the party president, to give up his aspirations to be the prime minister yet again.As per the seven-point agreement between the Congress and the CPN-UML on July 1, UML Chairman KP Sharma Oli, the incumbent prime minister, will lead the government for the first two years. Then Congress chief Deuba will lead the government until the elections in November-December 2027. Sharma urged Deuba to leave the prime minister’s post for another senior Congress leader. Deuba reportedly rejected the proposal outright.“I will not give up the position just because someone so desires,” Deuba reportedly said in response.Sharma, one of the two general secretaries of the country’s oldest political party, had proposed an exit policy in his contemporary political proposal tabled at the Mahasamiti meeting in February for the leaders holding state positions such as president, prime minister, ministers.Besides Sharma's proposal, the Mahasamiti also endorsed the papers submitted by Vice-president Purna Bahadur Khadka and General Secretary Gagan Thapa. However, it also gave room for the central committee to modify the proposal. When the central committee approved Khadka’s policy proposal and Thapa’s organisational proposal with minor changes, Sharma’s paper was pushed back to be considered while amending the national constitution.Sharma proposed one term for the [country’s] President, two terms for the prime minister, three terms for ministers, and four terms for lawmakers. Sharma’s proposal on term limits on persons serving as the country’s president or the prime minister is a national rather than the party’s issue, so it has been deferred, according to party leaders. Most of the Congress central leaders who spoke at the meeting, which lasted almost a month with gaps in between, claimed that fixing a time limit for the leadership was contrary to the democratic principle that the party champions.UML chief whip Mahesh Bartaula also says that since politics is a voluntary job, the politicians should be able to contribute to the society for as long as they want. “Nonetheless, the exit policy proposal is thought-provoking,” Bartaula told the Post. As a new generation of leaders is yet to be fully developed, the public still trusts the older crop of leaders, he argues. “Those vying for top positions are yet to gain the public’s credibility.”For Krishna Pokharel, a professor of political science, it would be unnatural to amend the constitution to address Sharma’s demand. “In countries where people directly elect their prime minister, amending the constitution to limit the executive head’s term could be reasonable” Pokharel told the Post. “However, in a country like Nepal where the parties choose the prime minister, exit policy should rather be mentioned in the party’s statute.” Had Nepali leaders internalised the spirit of the parliamentary system, their entry and exit points need not have been discussed. “The parliamentary system in Nepal has been vulgarised,” Pokharel added. According to political experts, despite the Congress leaders criticising the exit policy at the central committee, the proposal’s public appeal is growing. They see no alternative to its implementation, sooner or later. One reason for growing public disenchantment with political parties is that the same old faces have continued in leadership positions for a long time. If there were a term limit for a leader in a governmental or party position, people’s dissatisfaction would somehow be addressed.Experts say the recent political upheaval in Bangladesh and the political crisis of Sri Lanka two years ago were due to the continuous rule by a single person or a single family.One reason some democracies struggle is their political leaders’ unlimited hunger for power, Uddab Pyakurel, a political analyst, told the Post. “In Nordic countries, there is no need to set term limits for leaders as there is already a strong democratic culture there.” Despite having leaders like Donald Trump, American democracy still works, partly because of the term limits, Pyakurel reasoned. “If Nepal is to strengthen its democratic system, it must implement the exit policy for political leaders,” he said. Some political experts see problems even after introducing a term limit.Arguing that limiting the tenure for top positions alone is not enough to put curbs on autocratic tendencies, Khagendra Prasai, another political analyst, said: “The major issue is developing political mannerism and culture.”Calls for the top party leadership making way for a new generation are growing not just in the Congress. Even during the CPN (Maoist Centre) standing committee meeting last month, Deputy General Secretary Janardan Sharma questioned Pushpa Kamal Dahal’s uninterrupted leadership for nearly 35 years. Sharma even urged Dahal to resign the position. Experts say leaders with limited terms realise they must get a lot done within the given time at the top. There is no slow cooldown period. The current set of top party leaders—Deuba, Oli and Dahal in particular—have been in power for two or three decades, repeatedly assuming the country’s top executive position. Article 216 (7) of the Constitution of Nepal says a person elected mayor for two terms will not be eligible to be a candidate in future municipal elections. Article 215 (7) has a similar provision for chairpersons of rural municipalities.The constitution also has a two-term limit for President.While all other top governing posts come with fixed terms, there are limits on how many times the prime minister, chief ministers, ministers, and lawmakers can serve. This allows politicians to occupy office for as long as they choose, preventing the leadership handover to the next generation. In the view of Mighendra Bahadur Karki, executive director of the Centre for Nepal and Asia Studies (CNAS) at Tribhuvan University: “Leaders who know that their peers, even junior colleagues, may someday be their supervisors may be more thoughtful of their behaviour. Poor behaviour and status anxiety might be reduced, increasing the room for collaboration.” If senior leaders know that they need to bow out of the government or the party after a particular time, they are more likely to train and promote junior leaders to take their place, Karki told the Post. “This in turn will cultivate a healthy political culture.”But he warned that the question of term limit is not straightforward. “The exit policy, if it is to be implemented, should be system-centric rather than targeting particular leaders.” \nRae was the envoy to Kathmandu during the promulgation of the 2015 constitution and the subsequent blockade. In this conversation, Rae talks about the evolution of Nepal-India ties since the blockade, regional geopolitics, what the two countries get wrong about each other, how New Delhi views Nepali communist parties and the governments they lead, and the change (if any) in India’s neighbourhood policy since the start of Narendra Modi’s third term in office. \nKunwar has been the MD for just under three years. Before coming back to her homeland to join Daraz Nepal, she worked at different American companies, including Amazon, the world’s biggest e-commerce platform. In this conversation, Kunwar talks about the opportunities and challenges of running an e-commerce enterprise in Nepal, as well as the country’s overall business environment.  \nWhen the Ranjitkar group was established, they discovered this forgotten dance and devoted two years to researching it.Now, they are reintroducing it during Indra Jatra by training the new generation in this traditional art form. \nHe is known for his nationalist legacy, marked by the amendment of Nepal's map to include territories like Kalapani, Lipulekh, and Limpiyadhura, and his strong stance against India, especially during and after the 2015 Nepal blockade.But how did he rise to become the country's powerful man? \nPrakriti Bhattarai Basnet is a Master of Public Policy (MPP) candidate at the University of Oxford interested in the Digital Transformation of Governments, Cybersecurity, and Statecraft. She is a research assistant at the Blavatnik School of Government (one of the University of Oxford’s newest departments), which focuses on strengthening democracy by addressing threats to women in politics. Basnet is also a teaching fellow at the Harvard Kennedy School’s executive education program LSA-Public Narrative: Leadership, Storytelling, and Acton. In this conversation with the Post’s Timila Maharjan, Basnet discusses books that have helped her grow personally and professionally.How did you get into reading?My mother used to offer facials for women, going from house to house. At one of her clients' homes, she noticed that the daughter, who was around my age and attended St Mary's School, was always studying thick books. After discovering that these books were helpful for children's development, my mother started borrowing them for me. This sparked my love for books, but ‘Chicken Soup for the Soul’ ignited my passion for reading. Although access to those books was limited, I was captivated by the children's magazine ‘Muna’ and eagerly read every letter in ‘Kopila’.What kind of genre do you usually prefer? Choosing between genres is like choosing between my father and mother—I simply can’t. I enjoy reading all genres because each one stimulates the mind and soul in its unique way. Five years ago, I would have said non-fiction was my favourite, but now I believe reading should primarily be about enjoyment. In fiction, I have a particular fondness for dystopian novels. Recently, I’ve also been exploring Russian literature. This year, I read three of Dostoevsky’s works, and they have challenged my views on morality. I’ve hesitated to pick up another one because of how much they've shaken my beliefs. My growing interest in dystopian novels and Dostoevsky stems from how they help me reflect on my moral compass and question my beliefs.How has reading contributed to your personal and professional development?Every book I’ve read has left an imprint on me—some subtle, like a light trace on the sand, and others more significant, like a lasting scar—every opinion I hold or decision has been shaped by one book or another. On a personal level, reading has made me more empathetic and patient. Professionally, it has enriched my vocabulary and offered new perspectives for tackling challenges.Where do you prefer to read books, and why?I can’t read books anywhere else but at home. I don’t know where my home is because I have been moving around, but I prefer to read alone.Which book left an impression on you? And how has it influenced you?‘The Brothers Karamazov’ by Dostoevsky has affected me. I found reflections of myself in Alyosha, Ivan, and Dmitri—some aspects I utterly related to, while others were parts of myself I was hesitant to face. The struggle between good and evil, intertwined with themes of justice and forgiveness, made me confront my imperfections. It has even changed how I listen to others. The book has made me more like Alyosha, constantly seeking to understand what lies beneath the surface.Apart from reading, do you also enjoy writing?I experience imposter syndrome when it comes to writing. I create pieces but never share them. Although I want to pursue writing, I often feel that my work isn’t genuine and feels hypocritical. I need to learn to be honest about my emotions before writing.During lockdown, you went live on Instagram and read books to your followers. Why did you do that?If I’m being honest, it started because I was struggling with my sleep schedule. I saw many friends going through the same thing and thought, ‘Let's have a little story-time thing on Instagram before going to bed.’ We also wanted to raise awareness about some fantastic Nepali literature.Have your reading habits evolved since starting your studies at Oxford? Has it changed your approach to books?I haven’t had much time to read besides academic books and papers. Since arriving here and spending time with my friends, I’ve noticed that my ability to focus for long periods has improved significantly. It’s amusing how I expected to gravitate more towards non-fiction after coming here, but the people I’ve met have encouraged me to return to fiction. Their ability to quote Shakespeare, Austen, and Tolstoy during intense policy debates has inspired me.Have you encountered books that have changed your perspective on governance or public policy?Three books that I consumed and that transformed my perspective on policies are ‘Nudge: Improving Decisions about Health, Wealth, and Happiness’ by Richard H Thaler and Cass R Sunstein, ‘The Tragedy of Great Power Politics’ by John Mearsheimer, and ‘Governing the Commons: The Evolution of Institutions for Collective Action’ by Elinor Ostrom. I highly recommend ‘Nudge’ to everyone, as it uses behavioural economics to influence public policy, promoting small policy changes that can lead to significant improvements.Is there a book that everyone in public policy or leadership should read?Deborah Stone's ‘Policy Paradox: The Art of Political Decision Making’ highlights that policymaking is far more complex and nuanced than many realise. The book explains that policy decisions are not solely based on rationality but are influenced by various values that policymakers have consciously and unconsciously adopted.Are there any authors whose work resonates with your mission and values?I appreciate James C Scott’s work in ‘Seeing Like a State’. The book’s insights into large-scale project failures highlight the significance of local knowledge. I connect with this idea because urbanisation has often diminished the unique character of cities, and Scott’s book deepened my understanding of what it means to “see like a state.” Regarding Niccolò Machiavelli, people tend to be divided into two camps: those who admire him and those who think he could have benefited from therapy. Regardless, ‘The Prince’ offers valuable lessons in pragmatic governance.Which book are you currently reading? And why?I just submitted my final report, so I am reading something light. It’s called ‘Yellowface’ by RF Kuang. It’s straightforward but eccentric.Prakriti Bhattarai Basnet's five book recommendationsNudgeAuthor: Richard H Thaler and Cass R SunsteinPublisher: Yale University PressYear: 2008This book outlines how small nudges in policymaking can lead to subtle shifts that enable better decision-making.Crime and Punishment Author: Fyodor DostoevskyPublisher: The Russian MessengerYear: 1866Dostoevsky’s novel encourages self-reflection on morality, guilt, and redemption while exploring the internal conflicts of the human heart.Chirharan Author: Neelam Karki NiharikaPublisher: Sangri~la BooksYear: 2016It provides a glimpse into the lives of mythical characters through a feminist lens, highlighting their experiences and struggles.Deep Work Author: Cal NewportPublisher: Grand Central PublishingYear: 2016Young people struggling with popcorn brain syndrome should read this book to recognise the impact of reduced attention spans.QuietAuthor: Susan CainPublisher: CrownYear: 2012Cain’s book is for extroverts who secretly long for introversion, offering validation for those who balance both identities. \nThe Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP), the fourth largest in Parliament, is fiercely resisting what it claims are government moves to arrest its chair, Rabi Lamichhane, over allegations of his involvement in cooperatives fraud. But all the other national parties seem to be in favour of his prosecution. Among the seven national parties in Parliament, there is a growing consensus for holding Lamichhane accountable. A party needs to win at least one FPTP seat and get three percent proportional representation votes to get national party status.Ruling coalition partners such as the Nepali Congress, the CPN-UML, Ashok Rai’s Janata Samajbadi Party, and the Janamat Party believe that RSP chair Lamichhane should face the law. Additionally, the CPN (Maoist Centre), the main opposition in Parliament, along with the Rastriya Prajantra Party and Janata Samajbadi Party-Nepal (JSP-Nepal), both of which are outside the coalition, also support the parliamentary probe’s findings and advocate action against Lamichhane. The CPN (Unified Socialist), which is not a national party but has 10 seats in the lower house, has also joined the ranks of parties that want Lamichhane prosecuted. “Our party believes that, as a matter of principle, no innocent should be punished, and no guilty evade the law,” says the Maoist Centre Secretary Devendra Paudel.On the probe panel’s findings, Paudel said, “Evidence suggests that Lamichhane misused cooperative funds,” Paudel told the Post. “He should be held accountable for his actions as per the law.” A source close to Home Minister Ramesh Lekhak while talking to the Post said, “If everything goes as planned, the police will arrest Lamichhane soon.”However, during a recent interview with Kantipur Television’s Fireside program, Pushpa Kamal Dahal, the chairman of the Maoist Centre, was noncommittal on whether Lamichhane should be prosecuted for misusing cooperative funds.But party secretary Paudel said his party would take a stand against Lamichhane’s misuse of cooperative funds.Unified Socialist spokesperson Jagannath Khatiwada says that the probe panel’s recommendations should be implemented. “Although our party has yet to take an official position on it, I can say that our leaders are discussing the parliamentary probe report and there is a general consensus that the report’s recommendations should be implemented.”“The report suggests that the government should further investigate and prosecute four key people [Rabi Lamichhane, GB Rai, Chhabi Joshi, and Kumar Ramtel] involved in the misuse of multiple cooperative funds, and our party supports the report,” Khatiwada told the Post. “Those proven guilty should be booked under the prevailing laws.” While Rai is on the run, Ramtel is in judicial custody of Kaski police. After arresting Joshi, Police are now waiting for the government’s green light to arrest Lamichhane, who has twice served as deputy prime minister and home minister.The Janata Samajbadi Party-Nepal (JSP-Nepal), led by Upendra Yadav, also views Lamichhane as culpable in the misuse of the cooperative funds and disputes the RSP’s claim that he got a clean chit from the parliamentary special probe. “Our party does not want to disrespect any political leaders as such, but that does not mean a guilty individual should escape legal repercussions,” Manish Kumar Suman, the party central spokesperson, told the Post. “The report clearly indicates Lamichhane’s involvement in misusing cooperative funds, so there is no question of him getting a clear chit, unlike what the RSP leaders claim.” Rastriya Prajatantra Party Vice President Dhruba Bahadur Pradhan says the parliamentary probe panel, which investigated crisis-ridden cooperatives, has done its job and submitted a report and now it is the government’s responsibility to act on the recommendations.“As for our party’s position, Lamichhane should be prosecuted under the prevailing laws, as per the special committee’s report,” Pradhan told the Post. Lamichhane is accused of siphoning funds from multiple cooperatives to run the Gorkha Media Network, which operated the Galaxy 4k Television channel. The channel shut down last year. Chairman GB (Gitendra Babu) Rai and managing director Lamichhane jointly ran the media company before Lamichhane quit it to join politics in June 2022. On September 16, the parliamentary special committee submitted its report to Speaker Ghimire, who forwarded it to the government on the same day. On September 19, the Cabinet owned the report and ordered responsible ministries to act based on its findings. The probe panel’s report does not directly implicate Lamichhane in rerouting cooperative funds into the media, but it does label him guilty of using cooperative funds for Gorkha Media Network. The panel has recommended that the government prosecute Lamichhane; his business partner Rai; one of the founders of Gorkha Media Company, Chhabi Joshi; and board member Kumar Ramtel. As the panel report could not establish a direct link between Lamichhane and the rerouting of cooperative funds, RSP leaders interpret it as a ‘clean chit’ for their party chief. But leaders from other parties reject this claim.“The way RSP leaders are trying to interpret the probe panel’s report is distortion,” Pradhan said.Based on the report, the crime division of Nepal Police arrested Joshi, former deputy inspector general of Nepal Police and one of the founders of Gorkha Media Network, on the orders of Home Minister Ramesh Lekhak on Sunday. Following this, RSP chair Lamichhane organised a gathering of party sympathisers at his office to condemn the government amid rumours of his impending arrest. While addressing supporters at the RSP headquarters in Balaju, Kathmandu on Sunday evening, he urged them to be prepared to defend their new political force, claiming that a plan was afoot to ‘finish Rabi Lamichhane and the Rastriya Swatantra Party.’The erstwhile main opposition party, Nepali Congress, had continuously disrupted the parliamentary proceedings for over two months demanding a probe into the cooperatives scam, especially its connections to the Gorkha Media Network. In response, the immediate past government led by Maoist Centre chair Dahal had formed the parliamentary special probe panel.  \nRepresentatives at the first national conference of the Rastriya Swatantra Party saw factionalism within the party.Some of the representatives who arrived in Kathmandu three days ago for the two-day gathering starting on Tuesday said that growing factionalism is not healthy for the new political outfit promising to challenge traditional forces like the Nepali Congress and the CPN-UML.“We were told that factionalism existed in our party in various forms, but we denied such claims. However, during our three days in Kathmandu, we witnessed it,” a group of party members told the Post. It seems that President Rabi Lamichhane and Vice-president Swarnim Wagle are not in the same boat on how the party should function, they added.RSP acting spokesperson Manish Jha explains that it is the lack of synchronisation—rather than differences—between the leaders. “People from various schools of thought came together to form the RSP. It is true that we lack synchronisation, but it would be wrong to portray it as differences.”Another leader of the party said on condition of anonymity that the party has two schools of thought—one based on democratic principles and the other opposed to it.RSP acting general secretary Kabindra Burlakoti claims that the party is united.In conversations with the Post, representatives from Kathmandu Valley, Pokhara and Chitwan sounded more optimistic with the central leadership while those from remote areas were confused over their take on the party’s central leadership.The representatives from Madhesh were mild in their opinion about the leadership.Moreover, representatives were also not very positive about the way the central leadership is investing their energy to claim that Lamichhane had got a clean chit from the parliamentary special committee formed to investigate crisis-ridden cooperatives.The probe panel, which submitted its report to the House of Representatives, has recommended the government prosecute Lamichhane, along with his former business partner GB (Gitendra Babu) Rai, board member of the media Kumar Ramtel and initial founder Chhabi Lal Joshi as per the prevailing laws. The inquiry committee, however, has said it couldn’t establish Lamichhane’s role in rerouting the cooperatives fund to Gorkha Media Network.“It would have been better had the central leadership waited to see how the government would take action,” the group of representatives from western Nepal told the Post. “In case Lamichhane is booked under the law, it could be counterproductive for the party in the long run.”The political campaign started by the RSP won’t get stalled even without Lamichhane, the representatives said, expressing their confidence in the party’s longevity.Lamichhane also presented a political report incorporating proposed statutory changes, the party’s commitments to voters, policy agenda presented by Swarnim Wagle at the Jaleshwar meeting and the conclusion drawn from the closed session of the national conference.Lamichhane’s report states that the policy paper presented in Jaleshwar defined ‘constitutional socialism’ as the party’s political ideology. Lamichhane also accuses the ruling Nepali Congress and CPN-UML of trying to lead the country to a two-party system by polarising smaller parties. “On the pretext of administrative reform, they are planning to wipe out the existence of small parties,” the report reads. “Potentially, this step can bring together new parties that want to be an alternative political force sooner or later.”Asked about RSP’s possible alliance with other parties, Burlakoti said though they are not in talks with the main opposition CPN (Maoist Centre), they are in regular contact with several independent candidates of last election.Asked if they are in discussion with Kathmandu Metropolitan City Mayor Balendra Shah, who won the 2022 local election independently, Burlakoti said: “Strategic moves are not to be disclosed.”However, when the national conference concluded after Lamichhane presented his report, representatives arriving from around the country were displeased.“This is not the way a party functions,” a representative told the Post, asking not to be named for fears of reprisal.When leaders put themselves at the centre and cadres in the periphery, the party’s downfall begins, another representative said. Acting General Secretary Burlakoti, however, defended the party leadership. “Our national conference was designed this way,” Burlakoti said. The report presented by the chair will be discussed in the party’s Mahakali-Mechi campaign that will start soon, he added.“At the national conference, we gave 5 percent of the total representatives (1500) time to speak, but those who spoke exceeded that number,” Burlakoti said.The conference, however, passed Lamichhane’s report. On Wednesday, Lamichhane announced the date of the party’s first general convention. It will be held on May 8-10 at a yet-undecided venue.“I would like to inform you that the Central Committee has become the general convention organising committee,” Burlakoti said. Lamichhane also announced the ‘Mahakali-Mechi Campaign’ to interact with the general public.In his report, Lamichhane has proposed a person not affiliated to any party to be elected the country’s president, directly elected executive head, or the prime minister. He also proposes giving the nation’s vice president the responsibility to chair the National Assembly.While the paper bats for a fully proportional electoral system, it says provincial assemblies cannot be accepted in the current shape.However, this does not mean the RSP is against the federal structure gained through the sacrifice of thousands of people, another representative said. “Our party has no strength to amend the constitution and scrap the federal structure. Therefore, for the time being, voices are growing among the party members about accepting the present political structure,” Khemraj Koirala, a conference representative from Kailali told the Post.Party members also suggested downsizing the number of ministers to make the provincial system functional, Koirala said.The report also stands for reducing the number of municipalities to less than 500, from the current 753. \nThe coalition government of the CPN-UML and the Nepali Congress has reiterated its commitment to review the achievements made and weaknesses observed in the course of implementing the constitution in the past nine years.The two ruling parties have pledged to amend the constitution based on a broader understanding made through discussions, dialogues and consultations with political parties, civil society, intelligentsia, constitutional experts and the public.The parties have said such amendments will be made mainly based on the findings of the review and experiences of implementing it. Moreover, the parties said that establishing political stability in the country would be the major objective of the amendment.The two ruling parties made the commitments in the common minimum programme of the government, which was submitted to Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli and Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba on Wednesday evening. The parties had earlier formed a four-member panel to draft the government’s programme based on a seven-point agreement reached between the Congress and the UML in the first week of July. Party general secretary Gagan Thapa and spokesperson Prakash Sharan Mahat from Congress, and party deputy general secretaries Pradeep Gyawali and Bishnu Rimal from the CPN-UML were tasked to prepare the document. They jointly submitted the document to the two party chiefs and made it public.“The achievements of the 2006 movement and the fundamental pillars of this constitution including federal, republic and inclusive governance system will be further institutionalised and strengthened,” the document says.The seven-page document is divided into eight subtitles—safeguarding national interest and independent foreign policy; protection, implementation and amendment of the constitution; good governance and quality service delivery; dynamic economy and development; ensuring social justice and fundamental rights; youth partnership; transitional justice, sustainable peace and social harmony; and miscellaneous.The coalition has pledged to set up a high-powered cooperative regulatory body as per the recommendation of the parliamentary inquiry committee to address the problems seen in the cooperative sector.“Taking action against those involved in misusing funds from cooperatives, the return of depositors’ money will be ensured,” the common minimum programme states.The ruling parties have pledged to punish corrupt people irrespective of the individuals’ power and positions. On the economic front, the coalition has vowed to expedite generation and transmission of hydroelectricity and further intensify the electrification process. \nThe erstwhile Pushpa Kamal Dahal government on April 12 constituted a committee led by Om Prakash Mishra, a former chief justice, to nominate candidates to the Truth and Reconciliation Commission and the Commission of Investigation on Enforced Disappeared Persons. While the government picked four members for the committee, the fifth member is either the chairperson of the National Human Rights Commission or someone nominated by him. Initially, the commission had insisted that revision of the Enforced Disappearance Enquiry, Truth and Reconciliation Commission Act was a precondition for its participation in the committee, but following the Act’s amendment, it agreed to join the Mishra panel. However, three weeks after President Ramchandra Paudel authenticated the bill to amend the Act that the federal parliament endorsed, the constitutional human rights watchdog has yet to recommend its representative. Its officials said they are waiting for a formal request from the Ministry of Law, Justice and Parliamentary Affairs, as they expect a new letter in the changed context.“We have been told the ministry would send a new request letter for our representative, given the new context following the amendment to the Act,” said a commission member. The revised Act states that the recommendation committee has two months to make nominations for the chairpersons and members of the two commissions. It has already been five months since the Mishra-led panel was formed. However, a senior official at the law ministry said he does not think a new process needs to start just because the Act has been amended. “The two month countdown began the day the revised Act was enacted,” said the official. “I also don’t think the ministry told the commission that it would send a new request letter. If such a message was conveyed, it may have come from the political level.” Those involved in forging all-party consensus on the amendment say tensions between the CPN-UML and the CPN (Maoist Centre) have stalled the transitional justice process. Relations between the two parties have not been cordial ever since the formation of the new ruling alliance. The UML has consistently referred to the Maoist insurgency as ‘violence’, while the Maoist Centre has warned that the present KP Sharma Oli government could meet the same fate as Sheikh Hasina Wazed, the immediate past prime minister of Bangladesh.“The tussle between the two parties has directly affected the ongoing process,” one leader involved in the negotiations told the Post. “Oli doesn't seem as interested as he was earlier.”The committee was formed in May amid reservations from conflict-era victims of human rights violations and human rights defenders, who demanded that the Act be amended before selecting office bearers. The government, however, argued that forming the committee was necessary as per the Supreme Court’s March 12 order to the government to select office bearers for the two commissions within a month.The court had asked the government to constitute task forces within the commissions to conduct preliminary investigations into the victims’ complaints until the office bearers were appointed.Following the court’s order, the victims and human rights defenders demanded the government and the parties endorse the legal amendments by the top court’s deadline before starting the selection process. However, the amendment bill couldn’t be endorsed within the deadline, prompting the government to form a committee based on existing law.Following the committee’s formation, the victims and human rights defenders requested the government to halt the selection process until the Act was amended. They also urged the national rights watchdog to hold off on sending its representative.The two commissions have been defunct since July 2022, when the government decided to extend their terms without retaining their chairmen and members. The government claimed the bill to amend the transitional justice law would be endorsed by October 2022, and the appointments made based on the revised Act.But it took over two years for the federal parliament to endorse the bill. The victims and human rights defenders are closely watching who will be appointed to the commissions.The Truth Commission has received 63,718 complaints, while the commission on disappearances is sitting on around 2,400 cases. The new teams will have four years to accomplish their tasks, though there are provisions for their extension. The commissions that were formed in 2015 have done nothing other than collect complaints and conduct preliminary investigations on some of them.  \nTicket bookings for public transport during the Dashain festival will open this Saturday. Following discussions with stakeholders, the Department of Transport Management announced that tickets will be available online and at counters to manage the expected surge of nearly two million travellers leaving the Kathmandu Valley for the festivities.According to the department’s Director General, Rajiv Pokharel, transport operators will facilitate online bookings. “We have instructed operators to arrange online bookings wherever possible,” he said. “For counter bookings, passengers must obtain tickets only from official staff wearing uniforms and identification badges.”Around two million people are estimated to leave the Kathmandu Valley during Dashain. The department has introduced 20-point directives to ensure safe and hassle-free travel. Key measures include mandatory checks for alcohol consumption by drivers at major entry and exit points and the requirement for two drivers on long-distance routes. Additionally, those under 18 cannot work as assistant drivers.To assist travellers during Dashain, Tihar, and Chhath festivals, citizen help desks will be established at major locations such as Nagdhunga, Kalanki, Swayambhu, Halchowk, Machhapokhari, Gongabu Bus Park, Chabahil, Tilganga, Koteshwar, Jagati, Satdobato, Balkhu, Dakshinkali, Sundhara, and Sangha in Kavre. An inspection team comprising officials from various agencies will monitor travel arrangements with support from provincial transport ministries.Public transport operating on long and medium-distance routes must follow a designated queue system. Transport expert Ashish Gajurel noted that although bookings are open each year, passengers face difficulties. \"Bus operators don’t increase the number of buses during Dashain, despite rising demand. Authorities must increase the number of buses to ease travel,\" he said.Saroj Sitaula, senior vice-president of the Federation of Nepalese National Transport Entrepreneurs, however, argued that ‘unnecessary’ vehicle checks should be avoided to prevent inconvenience for passengers and drivers. He also highlighted the need to repair potholes on roads to ensure smooth travel.Earlier, Minister for Physical Infrastructure and Transport Devendra Dahal instructed the Department of Roads to complete road repairs nationwide before Ghatasthapana, the first day of the 15-day Dashain festival. The department reported that repairs are underway but have been delayed by the monsoon.The Narayanghat-Butwal road section, part of the East-West Highway, remains a major concern, with only 52.7 percent of its upgrade completed after six years of construction and multiple deadline extensions. The Meteorological Forecasting Division of the Department of Hydrology and Meteorology has predicted chances of rainfall in various places of the country for a couple of days more, raising concerns about travel difficulties during Dashain. Other problematic sections include Nagdhunga-Mugling and Mugling-Pokhara, with landslides and potholes reported along various highways, including the Mid-Hill, Madan Bhandari, Hulaki, and BP highways. \nPanic gripped locals in ward 12 of Chandragiri Municipality, Kathmandu, on Thursday morning after a suspicious object was found in the locality.The suspicious object was spotted in front of Balambu Secondary School, sparking fears of a bomb threat.Locals informed the police, and a bomb disposal team from the Nepal Army arrived at the scene. According to the NA Directorate of Public Relations and Information, the team disposed of the suspicious object, which turned out to be a pressure cooker.   \nKathmandu Metropolitan City has extended the area to prohibit building any structure on either side of the rivers in its territory.In a notice on Wednesday, the city office stated that construction of any structure has been barred on the additional 20 meters from the existing prohibited area.According to the metropolis notice, if the city has, under the existing rule, prohibited any construction on 20 meters from the area marked as river, the prohibited area will now be altogether 40 meters on either side of the waterway.The metropolis said the decision was taken based on a recent Supreme Court verdict that directed the authorities concerned to prohibit construction within an additional 20 metres from riverbanks in the Kathmandu Valley.Currently, construction is permitted only 20 metres beyond major riverbanks in the Kathmandu metropolis.The notice issued by the metropolis states, “No construction will be permitted on an additional 20 metres of land on either side of the river, and ongoing construction will be halted.”It has also asked one and all not to release contaminated water, including sewage, into Bagmati River and its tributaries. “Private and government buildings, as well as commercial properties, must install soak pits for groundwater recharge,” it said. “Waste must not be disposed of in the rivers. Non-compliance will lead to legal action under existing laws.” \nThe rhythmic beat of the Dha echoes through a Bhaktapur alley, blending with the energetic footsteps of dancers. Bhaktapur, which sees jatras and festivals round the year, is no stranger to music, dance and celebrations. But this is not an ordinary occasion. The performers in question are Lakhe dancers who are reviving the Ranjitkar Lakhe dance after a century.The young dancers are preparing for Indra Jatra this year, where mask-clad Lakhe dancers roam the streets to rid the community of hardships and suffering. Lakhe, demon deities revered as protectors of people and crops, are thought to reside in the demonic mask. As the dancer dons the mask, the spirit is said to take over.Bhaktapur was once a key site for the Ranjitkar Lakhe performances, but the art form vanished from the city after the 1934 earthquake.“Bhaktapur suffered the most damage during the 1934 earthquake,\" says Ganesh Ram Ranjit, treasurer of the Ranjitkar Group’s Bhaktapur branch. “The destruction left residents struggling to recover for a decade, making it nearly impossible to perform the costly Lakhe dance.”The Ranjitkar Group discovered the extinct dance in the year the group was established. They located a Lakhe temple in Bhaktapur that had closed after the earthquake. After two years of research, they learned that performing the Lakhe dance was seen as a good omen in Bhaktapur and involved hosting community feasts. However, the high cost of this tradition forced many to sell their properties, rendering it unfeasible in the city’s post-earthquake conditions. Over time, the dance was abandoned as more lands supporting these cultural events were lost during rapid urbanisation.“There was a significant decline in our engagement with our cultural heritage,” says Rabi Shakya, a sculptor and Lakhe dance teacher training the new dancers. “The encouraging change now is the strong interest from the new generation, which is making it possible to revive intangible heritage like this dance.”After 100 years, the Ranjitkar Lakhe Dance is making a return to Bhaktapur at this year’s Indra Jatra.“It’s challenging to accurately re-enact the dance since it hasn’t been seen in a century,” Shakya notes. “As a sculptor, I drew inspiration from Bhaktapur’s revered Shree Navadurga Bhawani to create the Lakhe’s mask.” Similarly, the dance was choreographed by studying Lakhe dances from Kathmandu, Patan, and Banepa within the Ranjitkar community, and combining them with traditional steps from Bhaktapur Lakhe dances.“As for the musical instruments, we are using traditional instruments like Dha, Dhime, and Ponga, which are said to excite the Lakhe,” says Rajendra Maharjan, Lakhe dance teacher and musician.Maharjan is one of the experienced Newari arts teachers working to revive the lost Lakhe dance. He is involved in training young students in cultural arts and is now dedicated to the Ranjitkar dance training, with the students practising together nearly every day.“Becoming a Lakhe performer involves more than just wearing the costume and mask,” said Sudin Ranjit, a Lakhe dance student. “We must train extensively with our teachers, and it demands a lot of hard work.”To Ranjit, a resident of Bhaktapur, the training is more than learning a new craft; it is a matter of protecting culture. Growing up only interested in instruments, he slowly understood how important continuing cultural practices like Lakhe dances is for their community.“The dance will not only bolster Bhaktapur’s cultural pride but also boost tourism and create jobs,” says Dr Purushottam Lochan Shrestha, a professor and researcher specialising in Bhaktapur and Newari culture.Shrestha notes that reviving the dance would offer employment to everyone involved, from the dancers and the sculptor making the masks to those participating in the rituals. “Economic centres throughout the city, from small businesses to large industries, will benefit from the influx of tourists attracted by the Lakhe dance,” Shrestha adds, commending the Ranjitkar group's initiative.Once the Ranjitkar community revitalises the Lakhe dance, the Ranjitkar group plans to set up a new Guthi house with a fresh community fund and organise annual events for the dance.“The Lakhe dance won’t let them separate,” Shakya remarks.In today’s globalised world, where identity often merges into a homogenised blend, shared cultural practices provide a sense of connection and belonging. This new Lakhe dance embodies that spirit of togetherness for the community involved.“Reviving the dance after 100 years,” Shakya says, “is about preserving our culture for the next 300 years.” \nThe Lions Club of Kathmandu Corporate, Nepal MD325-D has felicitated various personalities as part of its endeavour to recognise the contribution of the individuals and business entities for the society.As part of its campaign, the Lions Club of Kathmandu honoured Prateek Pradhan with Social Journalism Award, Sylapa T Rimponche with Social Spiritual Award, Erika Gurung with Social Player Award, Ramesh Corporation with Social Corporate House Award, Rajendra Malla with Social Corporate Leader Award and Rajesh Hamal with Social Celebrity Award.Likewise, Chandra Ghimire is honoured with Social Bureaucratic Award, Binod Das with Sports Management Award, Anil Kedia with Social Academic Award, Mohan Ojha with Social Management Award and Surya Nepal with Corporate Social Responsibility Award.The Lionism embarked in Nepal in 1971 as the Lions Club of Biratnagar under the stewardship of former Prime Minister Matrika Prasad Koirala.The Lions Clubs International says it has over 2,000 clubs operating across the nation. \nFive years ago, on September 30, 2019, when KP Sharma Oli was prime minister for the second time, the government declared the entire country open-defecation free amid much fanfare. However, years later, thousands of people from across the country are getting infected with diarrheal diseases, including scores from cholera.Rautahat is among the nine districts reporting cholera outbreaks this year. Ward 4 of Rajpur Municipality has reported over 100 cases of diarrheal infection and hospitalisation. However, the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division said only 12 people from the municipality had so far contracted cholera.“Over 100 diarrheal patients from the municipality’s ward 4 have been hospitalised,” Khusid Ahmad, a health worker at the municipality, told the Post over the phone from Rautahat. “Contaminated drinking water could be the culprit for the cholera outbreak there. Samples of drinking water collected from affected areas have been sent for lab tests.”Apart from Rautahat, eight other districts—Lalitpur, Kathmandu, Kailali, Pyuthan, Makawanpur, Rolpa, Sindhupalchok, and Achham—have also reported cholera outbreaks this year. So far, the number of diarrheal patients who have contracted cholera is 95. Interestingly, most of the districts that have witnessed outbreaks of deadly cholera this year had years ago been declared open defecation-free.The Vibrio cholera 01 Ogawa serotype has been confirmed in the stool samples of the infected patients. Doctors say that detected cases of cholera infection could be just the tip of the iceberg, as most positive cases are being reported from the districts with active surveillance.Public health experts say outbreaks of cholera in multiple districts, even five years after the country was declared open defecation-free, show a huge gap between official declarations and progress on the ground.They say outbreaks of diarrheal diseases, including cholera, are directly linked to drinking water, sanitation, and hygiene conditions, and the country was declared open defecation-free without improving water and sanitation conditions.“Without ensuring the quality of drinking water and sanitation, among other things, authorities rushed to declare the entire country free from open defecation,” said Dr Mingmar Gyelgen Sherpa, former director general at the Department of Health Services. “Instead of improving basic water and sanitation infrastructure, we’ve focussed too much on outbreak management, and this is the wrong approach.”Even though toilets have been built in most households, open defecation is still widespread in many places. Drinking water samples collected from various parts of the country, including from the districts of the Kathmandu Valley, have been found contaminated with faecal coliform, which means the water the public uses for drinking is unsafe. The presence of faecal coliform, a microscopic organism that thrives in the intestines of warm-blooded animals or their faeces, indicates sewage contamination in the drinking water, according to doctors.A previous study had shown that 81 percent of water samples collected in the Kathmandu Valley were contaminated with deadly microbes.“We only focussed on expanding coverage of drinking water but did not pay attention to ensuring its safety,” said Dr Meghnath Dhimal, chief researcher at the Nepal Health Research Council. “Authorities concerned must also focus on improving the quality.”Experts say improving public hygiene is essential to ensuring water quality and avoiding diarrheal ailments. Awareness drives and health education play a crucial role in changing behaviours, which requires years of investment and continuous efforts.Along with investment in health education, attention should go to building climate-resilient infrastructures for drinking water and sanitation, as water resources have been contaminated by floodwaters in many districts. The effects of climate change have increased adverse events, including floods, which in turn have contaminated the source of drinking water, making people vulnerable to infection with diarrheal ailments.“Multiple agencies of the three tiers of government and non-governmental sectors have to make more effort to prevent diarrhoea outbreaks,” said Sherpa. “But there seems to be a lack of coordination among government agencies.” The World Health Organisation also stresses on a multifaceted approach as a key to controlling cholera and reducing deaths. \nUS President Joe Biden will announce on Tuesday the donation of 1 million mpox vaccine doses and at least $500 million to African countries to support their response to the outbreak, according to a senior administration official.Biden will make the announcement in New York, where he is attending the United Nations General Assembly, and call on other countries to follow suit, the person told Reuters.In August, the World Health Organization declared mpox a global public health emergency for the second time in two years, following an outbreak of the viral infection in the Democratic Republic of Congo that has spread to neighbouring countries and beyond, including India, raising alarm.“It wouldn’t be a huge surprise if there were a case in the United States, either,” the official said, noting that recent cuts in pandemic support by Congress may hamper a domestic response.“We’re really squeezing right now to be able to respond effectively in this moment. And I think anticipating potentially additional cuts in the future will make it more and more difficult for us to have a robust response to these types of outbreaks.”Mpox can spread through close contact. Usually mild, it is fatal in rare cases. It causes flu-like symptoms and pus-filled lesions on the body.The outbreak in Congo began with the spread of an endemic strain, known as clade I. But a new variant, clade Ib, appears to spread more easily through routine close contact, including sexual contact.The expectation is that the US donated doses will be of the Bavarian Nordic vaccine known as Jynneos in the United States, and many will come from a stockpile in the United States. The 1 million doses is in addition to the 60,000 previously donated shots.The US official said the administration expects Gavi, a public-private alliance which co-funds vaccine purchases for low-income countries, to distribute the donated vaccines.“We feel really strongly that Gavi is the multilateral institution that is best positioned to procure and equitably distribute vaccines,” the official said.Last week, Gavi said it will buy 500,000 doses of Bavarian Nordic's vaccine, its first purchase to help battle the outbreak.The Biden administration is also pushing for more vaccines to be manufactured in low and middle-income countries, and is working with Brazil to identify how the Group of 20 club of nations can support the mpox response.There is not currently a manufacturer in Africa that is able to make the complex drug substance needed to make the vaccine, the US official said. \nAt least 190 women from 51 districts died of complications during childbirth in the fiscal year 2023-024, data provided by the Family Welfare Division under the Department of Health Services show. The actual number of maternal deaths due to birth-related complications could be much higher, as maternal and perinatal death surveillance is being carried out in 51 districts only, officials say.“Maternal deaths from childbirth-related complications could be significantly underreported, as we are only tracking cases in 51 districts,” said Nisha Joshi, a public health official at the division. “We have no data on maternal and perinatal deaths in the rest of the districts.”In the fiscal year 2022-023, 191 maternal deaths were recorded across 49 districts. Nepal reduced the maternal mortality rate from 239 per 100,000 births in 2016 to 151 per 100,000 in 2021, according to the national census carried out by the National Statistics Office. Earlier, the country had reduced the maternal mortality rate from 539 per 100,000 births in 1996 to 239 per 100,000 births in 2016—for which the country even received a Millennium Development Goals award. The health target under the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals is to reduce the maternal mortality rate to 75 per 100,000 births by 2030.The latest census report has shown that 622 maternal deaths were recorded in a year. Officials at the Health Ministry concede that the number of deaths reported from 51 districts is only around 30 percent of the total maternal deaths occurring across the country.They complained that the lack of maternal and perinatal death surveillance programmes in all districts is the main reason for the underreporting of maternal deaths. “Due to budget constraints, we could not expand the maternal and perinatal death surveillance to other districts this year,” said Joshi. “We also have problems in the reporting system, and deaths that occur in villages of the districts without surveillance programmes go unreported.”Maternal health experts say that concerned authorities are keeping themselves in the dark by not conducting studies in all districts. “Without knowing the actual situation, effective planning is not possible, which means efforts to reduce ongoing deaths may not succeed,” said Dr Ganesh Dangal, a maternal health expert. A huge budget is not necessary to carry out death surveillance. So this programme should be enforced mandatorily in all districts immediately.”Maternal and perinatal death surveillance is a key intervention for improving maternal, perinatal, and neonatal survival rates. Experts say such surveillance provides an understanding of the number and causes of deaths, enabling more targeted and effective interventions.Nepal strives to reduce the deaths of mothers and babies. However, it lacks maternal and perinatal death surveillance in all districts.Perinatal death is the death of a baby between 22 weeks of gestation (or weighing 500g) and seven days after birth.The World Health Organisation said that maternal and perinatal death surveillance and response (MPDSR) is an essential quality improvement intervention, which permits the identification, notification, quantification and determination of causes and avoidability of maternal and neonatal deaths and stillbirth to orient the measures necessary for their prevention.According to the UN health body, systematic analyses of overall mortality trends and events and contributing factors leading to individual deaths can identify barriers in health systems and inspire local solutions to prevent such deaths in the future.Studies carried out in the past show that excessive bleeding after childbirth, pre-eclampsia and eclampsia (pregnancy-related high blood pressure disorders) are some of the reasons for maternal deaths.The World Health Organisation said postpartum haemorrhage is the leading cause of maternal mortality in low-income countries and the primary cause of nearly a quarter of all maternal deaths globally. Most deaths resulting from the said complication occur during the first 24 hours after birth.Gynaecologists say tears in the cervix or tissues of the vagina, tear in a blood vessel in the uterus, bleeding in hidden tissue area or space in the pelvis, blood clotting disorders, and placenta problems are among the causes of postpartum haemorrhage.Every year, over 600,000 women deliver babies in Nepal. \nJapanese encephalitis outbreak in Nepal has killed 17 since June, with 29 districts reporting infections and 12 experiencing deaths, prompting health officials to seek vaccine aid due to high child mortality and low vaccination rates.\nA Kathmandu woman's lead poisoning diagnosis highlights a rise in heavy metal poisoning cases linked to dietary supplements, ayurvedic medicines, and other sources, raising concerns about the lack of antidotes in Nepal.\nDusit Princess Kathmandu hosts a 5-day trout festival at SOI restaurant, featuring 12 unique dishes showcasing flavors from Nepal, India, the Orient, and various cuisines, highlighting the versatility of locally sourced trout.\nA young baker's initial misadventures lead to a passion for understanding the science behind baking, resulting in tips and tricks to overcome common baking challenges.\nIn the face of prevalent judgment and safety concerns, LGBTQIA+ individuals have found a haven in Inclusive Galaxy Restaurant in Kathmandu, a space that echoes the legacy of the Stonewall Riots, fostering a sense of community, acceptance, and hope for a more inclusive society.\nNepali chef Aditya Mishra promotes Nepali cuisine in New York through his restaurant 'The Sewing Tin,' using modern culinary techniques to elevate traditional dishes like kachaila and chatamari.\nCeleus Baral exudes a serene aura when you meet her, and when she tells you she bakes, it makes sense. Even during a brief encounter, you can tell she has the patience needed to be a baker.“You can eyeball cooking, but baking is chemistry. You have to be meticulous. You cannot rush it, or it does not turn out as expected,” says the 21-year-old environment science student. She also runs the online baking shop Bakeleus. Recently, she has also started selling her baked goods beyond her online shop, with her first stall appearing at The Yellow House’s Night Market. Bakeleus’s menu lists a variety of offerings, including jams, granola, tarts, cakes, cookies, cupcakes and brownies. Baral began baking in 2020, during the lockdown, and launched her online shop last year.She grows much of the produce she incorporates into her baking, and believes we should all understand the origins of our food. “This connection fosters gratitude and a deeper appreciation for nature,” she says. Her background in environmental science, coupled with her affinity for the natural world, imbues her creations with a unique artistic sensibility. Each item she bakes is a testament to her creativity and experimentation, as she believes consistent practice is the key to mastery.Despite the demands of being a full-time student, Baral strives to accommodate orders, typically requiring a minimum of 72 hours' notice for delivery. She is a passionate and discerning individual, evident in the love she infuses into her baking. Additionally, Baral advocates for a zero-waste policy at home, ensuring that every scrap of food and all household items are recycled.Three easy to bake recipes you can try at homeMini carrot cakes Ingredients:38 g milk or yoghurt35 g all-purpose flour1/4 tea spoon ground cinnamon1/8 tea spoon ground gingerA pinch of cardamom1 tea spoon baking powder½ tea spoon fine sea salt2 large eggs, at room temperature27 g granulated sugar13 g brown sugar (or 39 g of regular granulated sugar)1 tea spoon vanilla extract27 g extra virgin olive oil33 g carrots, peeled and shreddedChopped walnutsCandied lemon or orange slices (optional for garnish)Cream cheese frosting56.5 g unsalted butter, softened113.5 g cream cheese, softened1/2 teaspoon vanilla extractA pinch of salt250 g powdered sugarDirections:For the cake:Preheat the oven to 195°C.

Yet, pockets of the past remain—small, peaceful neighbourhoods where houses are still made of wood, paths are made of stone tiles, and the stillness of a world that wants to stay intact and immobile. These places are known for tourism, culture, and the restoration of community pride. One such stop is the quiet village of Khokana in southern Lalitpur.Khokana is comparatively close to the mainland urban Lalitpur; from the ring road junction of Bagdole, it takes only a 10-minute drive to reach there. From the airport, you can take a cab directly to Khokana, which will take around half an hour. Get your cameras and hiking boots ready; the area is filled with historical artefacts and hiking trails.However, it is vastly different from the city. It is much nearer to the hills, where stone-paved paths, which could easily be goat trails, are rare in today’s Kathmandu.One such goat trail leads to Sikali temple, a major attraction of the area and accessible only on foot. The pavements are lined with big and small temples on each side, along with ponds that serve as clean water sources and a location for religious rituals. The houses are made of bricks and wood. The concrete invasion, although present, is minimal. Scattered every few hundred metres are small mustard oil mills, co-operative businesses of the locals of Khokana that have existed since medieval times.A site well-recognised for its historical significance, Khokana was even proposed to be made a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1996. Sikali TempleAround an hour’s walk from the historic town, Sikali Temple can be reached, which is also the location for its famed Sikali Jatra.While it can be reached through any public vehicle, a more holistic and adventurous route is to follow the goat trails on the outskirts of Khokana. This route, albeit long, allows for great hiking opportunities, scenic views of the hills surrounding the Kathmandu Valley, and a close-up view of the mediaeval but well-maintained architecture of the local houses.Even if you lose the way, which is very possible, the locals are very welcoming and more than willing to guide you. The main temple itself is three stories tall, and built in the Pagoda style, a common style in many temples in the valley.It is surrounded by a lush grass field which plays the stage to the Sikali Jatra held every year. The temple, like many religious spots around Khokana, is dedicated to the local deity Shree Rudrayani.The Sikali Jatra, a five-day festival that serves as an alternative to Dashain for the Khokana locals, is filled with chariot dances, battle enactments, and storytelling celebrations in the worship of Goddess Rudrayani.Starting from Ghatasthapana in mid to late September, the Jatra is vibrant and an essential experience for every visitor. Historical Khokana townKhokana’s historical town is located around 5 minutes walking distance from the local bus park. The town complex, paved with hand-made stone tiles, is graced with the Indrayanee temple but also has many red-bricked houses built in the local Newari architecture, some of them centuries old.One such house is the ‘Khokana Museum’. Although closed, it is widely popular for being the first house to be lit with electricity in Nepal, as Chandra Shamsher did in 1911.The stand-holder of the first light bulb can still be seen, serving as a historical monument for everyone to see.Similarly, the town complex is also filled with Guthi houses, small ponds, and even the local Ward office. While the Ward office provides a wealth of information for visitors interested in the area’s history, the Guthi halls symbolise the strong community support culture of the locals.The ponds, a notable one present right opposite the Indrayanee temple, have stone taps and remind us of primitive ways of obtaining clean water—a practice many locals are still engaged in.Yet, these ponds are also religious locations, especially used in rituals in the Sikali Jatra.Finally, a stroll through the complex allows visitors to explore old houses and historical artefacts in the serene quietness of Khokana, while the small outlets and Choila places nearby allow you to enjoy the spicy duck or chicken delicacies at the same time.Overall, the historical complex is enough to transport visitors back to a glimpse of the medieval past of the Kathmandu Valley. Mustard oil millsThe most well-known feature of Khokana is its mustard oil mills, which have been operational for hundreds of years and have been using the same methods of preparation since their inception.These mills, scattered throughout Khokana, are often community-owned, and even the ones owned by certain individuals have almost exclusively employed locals.Despite the advent of modern machinery, there is still substantial demand for their products due to the assured guarantee.When I visited one such mill, the local staff informed me that the furnace and oil presser used by them were 300 years old, given by the Patan royalty even before the Shahs became king.In addition to buying pure, organically created mustard oil and pellets, visiting these oil mills offers many educational benefits for international and local tourists alike.Khokana offers visitors a unique glimpse into a preserved bubble of the past through its tranquillity, preservation of ancient lifestyle and cultural elements, and remarkable self-sustenance.  \n“How much oxygen do you have for the summit?”I think this is the kind of question a film producer would ask. But when you're on the mountain, the answer is never clear.I have worked for a long time in the film industry and different art areas, especially photography and engraving.Working in various fields and drawing inspiration from them has become a new normal for me. I have made this approach my way of life without even realising it.I took responsibility for producing the last movie I worked on and shot the behind-the-scenes footage for a documentary. By doing so, I witnessed the entire shooting process and the journey of a movie.In the snowy highlands of Turkey, we had to endure the consequences of the changing climate to shoot ‘About Dry Grasses’, directed by Nuri Bilge Ceylan. The highlands used to be snowy in January, but by the time we got there in the same month, there was no snow. Nature was changing. It was responding to what was happening—to what humanity had done to it. In the end, it snowed, and we shot the intense snow scenes we wanted. But since most of our days were sunny, unlike what the director wanted, we had to shoot in the sunset and sunrise hours. As crew members, we spent many days waiting for the sun to set.Production requires creating opportunities, finding solutions, and being creative for a work of art to come true. For this, patience, endurance, calmness, and timing are necessary. On the other hand, nature wanted us to listen to it and wait for the right time.During that time, I witnessed many of nature's lessons. For example, I experienced extreme cold for the first time. We endured temperatures ranging from -33 degrees to +55 degrees. By listening to nature, surrendering to its forces, and working within its limits, we managed to persevere.No matter how much you prepare or plan during the pre-production phase, if you are working in nature, remember that nature will always have the final say.The film was completed, released, and connected with audiences. Its success at Cannes 2023 was followed by my trip to the North Pole for my project. I returned with a mix of wonderful developments, joys, and challenges. During this process, I experienced life and death, happiness and sadness, losses and awards.I realised the value of being able to breathe comfortably a few days after my father's chemotherapy ended. Just a few days earlier, he had said, \"Well done, my daughter. I'm glad you went!\" All the anxiety and hard work, filled with fears at the beginning, were finally behind me.Before going to Everest, when I was on the verge of giving up, defeated by my fears, I remembered my father's words. Everest reminded me of what he said while struggling to breathe, adding a turning point to my life.What does it mean to say ‘life’s turning point?’ How many turning points can there be in life?Who am I, and what am I doing in this world? How well do I know my own limits? Can I find answers to these big questions? These thoughts sparked my dream of journeying to Everest. Now, after returning, I can say that it turned my life around.“How much oxygen do you need for the summit?” sounds more like “How much do you need to hold on to life?” How many reasons do you find that give meaning to your life, keep you alive, and allow you to breathe? How much can you endure in the face of obstacles, and can you keep believing that a solution will eventually come your way?Can these questions be separated from the idea of measuring and assessing something, from learning its quantity and financial value? Can everything be known with certainty? Should the journey be fully understood in advance, with all its promises laid out? Should it be viewed like a purchase with a price tag, asking, “Is this journey worth this much?”I had never trekked before and had no climbing experience. I had lived at sea level my entire life and had never been to a high altitude.However, this journey was not only about the physical climb but also an inner discovery. After losing my father to lung cancer, his breathing difficulties taught me the fragility of breath, life, and existence. I also mentally prepared myself for the physical challenges I might face. Despite all my concerns, could this journey help me understand the cycle of life and the resilience of the soul?So, how could I make this trek possible? How could I land in Nepal? Despite all the economic difficulties and the many things I felt needed organising, I did my best and believed in it.Since I was embarking on this journey, I felt I should share about my travels and inspire others.Starting with photography, cinema, and engraving, which are already integral parts of my life, I dreamed of documenting and sharing the inspiring aspects of this journey.After months of correspondence and dreaming, it all came true. Finally, I embarked on the journey with the goal of creating photographs, engravings, and documentaries. I learned a great deal from my travels in Nepal, from the people I met, and from every moments I witnessed. I felt incredibly fortunate to have been able to honour my father’s memory with the peace and serenity I experienced in the Himalayas.During my 15-day journey to Everest Base Camp, I encountered nature’s masterpieces at every turn. As concerns like “How will I endure?” and “How will I finish?” started to weigh on me, the mountains suddenly parted with the clouds and gazed down at me.It was amazing to witness the appearance of ‘Gods’ that I had never seen before, in such immense size and in such a close, awe-inspiring manner beside me during that silent walk.As someone who came from one of the most crowded cities in the world, Istanbul, while I struggled with my daily questions and uncertainties, trying to control everything, they stood there calmly, as if answering me.They were just there—before and after.My guide, Lakhpa Sherpa, always reminded me not to worry about how high we were, how long it would take to reach our accommodation, or what the weather would be like. He encouraged me to live in the moment, and he was right.He advised me to focus on my breathing, not to get thirsty, to eat enough, and to appreciate the extraordinary beauty of the journey. In the mountains, plans dissolve and each moment is embraced as it comes.All the good wishes, prayers, and everything encountered along the way were for the journey itself. The mountain was full of life, secrets, and everything I had wondered about.This 15-day journey to Everest Base Camp was a solo adventure, yet I wouldn't have been able to complete it without my guide, Lhakpa, and my porter. Additionally, I was fortunate enough to experience the hospitality, generosity, and honesty at Trekkers Paradise, which organised the entire journey and provided guidance.I witnessed how dedication and sincerity are crucial in completing a journey safely and healthily. Ghanshyam Sharma, from Trekkers Paradise and Sauraj Jhingan, a climber who summited the Everest in 2018, shared their experiences with me during the journey.They experienced the 2015 earthquake while they were at the Everest Base Camp.As a filmmaker, their role as actors, and attention to detail played a significant role in bringing my dream photography and documentary project to life.The sponsors of my journey were Turkish Airlines, The North Face, Apple, Canon, and Stanley. My supporters include Oscar International College and Nepal Film Campus. Throughout the journey, I shared many experiences, memories, and countless photos and images with my students.On my way back home after 21 days, I celebrated my birthday on the plane. From the right window, the Himalayas bid me farewell. I felt like I had opened a new chapter in my life, and I was certain that I would return.I had made many friends and memories in Nepal.For now, I will be working on a documentary and preparing for a photography and engraving exhibition titled ‘My Soul Beyond the Mountain’.To the Himalayas: This summer was spent with you, but we will meet again soon. \nWe spent five days in Sri Lanka two weeks ago, driving up and down the island, covering almost 70 percent of its territory. Our tour spanned over 1,000 kilometres, including hills, beach spots, and heritage and religious sites.Our first stop in Sri Lanka was Colombo’s Bandaranaike International Airport. We were greeted by a warm and humid breeze when we exited the airport. The host briefed us (a group of journalists) that heavy rainfall has affected areas across Sri Lanka since mid-May 2024. Rain and storms intensified on June 1, with the most significant effects in the south and west of the country. We were lucky to have no rain in the forecast.On the first night, we checked into the lavish Jetwing Lake resort, an opulent sanctuary amidst the lush landscape. The resort’s expansive grounds were a retreat, offering a glimpse of Sri Lanka's natural beauty. We feasted on delicious cuisine, every bite exploding with flavour, introducing us to the island’s famed culinary delights. On June 7, early morning, the sun shone brightly, previewing the promise of an incredible journey ahead. We set off early the following day, eager to explore the mysteries of this enchanting island. As we ventured further into the heart of Sri Lanka, the landscape revealed its majestic nature. We were astounded by seeing Pidurangala Rock, a 200-metre-high granite colossus just a kilometre north of Sigiriya. The short hike to Pidurangala Rock offered breathtaking views of Sigiriya and beyond. We climbed the steep steps and soon were rewarded with a breathtaking panoramic view of the surrounding landscape. It took us 30 minutes to climb. The sight took our breaths away and left us humbled in the presence of such grandeur. From the top are glorious vistas of the surrounding landscape and an incredible view of the majestic Sigiriya Rock. From there, Sigiriya Lion’s Rock is visible, standing alone. This was the place where demon king Ravana had his palace in the Treta Yuga. Believed to have been built 50 centuries ago, the palace is said to have had a unique lift for Ravana and his visitors. Ravana imprisoned Sita in one of the caves at the bottom of this humongous boulder. Sigiriya is a fifth-century fortress in Sri Lanka carved out of an inselberg, a hill of hard volcanic rock that soared high above the surrounding jungle. We spent two hours atop the rock, mainly taking photographs. We descended from Pidurangala Rock, filled with awe and a sense of accomplishment.The journey ahead seemed even more enticing as we ventured along the winding roads, heading towards our next destination.Cash-strapped Sri Lanka plunged into its worst financial crisis in more than seven decades in 2022, with a severe dollar shortage sending inflation soaring to a high of 70 percent, its currency to record lows, and its economy contracting 7.3 percent.Thanks to the growing number of tourists, Sri Lanka is now bouncing back.In Jetwing Lake, we met Kasun Pradeep Somasiri, a receptionist. He briefed us that the resort is now 50 percent occupied. “That’s a better figure now as we are recovering.”The travel and tourism sector is a significant income generator for Sri Lanka. However, the economic crisis, the Ukraine–Russia war, and China’s zero-Covid policy have jeopardised the industry.Tourism accounted for more than 12 percent of the country’s GDP in 2019 and was the third-largest source of foreign exchange reserves, behind worker remittances and the apparel industry.Sri Lanka was poised to be one of the world’s best holiday destinations due to its rich culture, wealth of natural resources, and diversity of accessible experiences.However, tourism-dependent Sri Lanka suffered its first major setback with the Easter bombings 2019. This led to the collapse of inbound tourism flows as international arrivals declined by 18 percent year-on-year, and tourist expenditure fell by 17.7 percent that year. This was immediately followed by two years of pandemic restrictions. Inbound visitors fell to just 116,600 in 2021.An acute balance of payments crisis forced Sri Lanka to preemptively default on foreign debt of over $50 billion in April 2022, triggering a crippling economic contraction with spiralling inflation.“Tourism is gaining momentum,” says Somasiri. “The British and Chinese have started to return to Sri Lanka.”January-August is the peak season for foreigners. “From December to April, local people travel for holiday purposes,” says Somasiri. Before we started the tour to other religious sites, our tour guide, Sampath Mayadunne, told us, “Don't take selfies with your back to Buddha.” Turning your back on a Buddha statue and some other religious sites to take photos and videos is a strict no-no.The most common sight across Sri Lanka is the tank cascades system, an ancient irrigation infrastructure. The system is a network of small tanks draining to large reservoirs that store rainwater and surface runoff for later use.“These infrastructures were built by its ancient kings over 2,000 years ago to solve the water scarcity in the country’s dry zone,” says Mayadunne.On day two, we travelled to Ranweli Spice Garden in Matale. This garden is famous for its rare spices and herbs. A tour of the gardens will show you the cultivation, harvesting, cleaning, and packaging process, as well as the health benefits and uses of the herbs.On the way, we saw a colourful Muthumariamman Hindu temple, boasting hundreds of detailed sculptures in a rich mosaic of colour.In Kandy, we visited the Temple of the Tooth Relic (Sri Dalada Maligawa), one of the most sacred places of worship in the Buddhist world. It was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1988.The temple sustained damage from bombings by Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna in 1989 and by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam in 1998. However, it was fully restored each time.We then headed to Jetwing St Andrew’s, a luxurious 5-star property in Sri Lanka’s hill country of Nuwara Eliya, situated at 1,900 metres above sea level. During our stay in Kandy, we immersed ourselves in the city's charm and the serenity of the countryside. On the third day, early morning, we travelled to Nuwara Eliya, the area famous for tea estates that give many Nepalis the feeling that they have come to Kanyam, Ilam, in eastern Nepal.We visited a tea factory called Damro Labookellie Tea Centre, the oldest tea centre in Sri Lanka. Due to its cold climate, it is the most important area for tea production in Sri Lanka.In this tea factory, they make white and black tea, while the green tea is processed in another tea factory and then sent to Damro.After the tea factory tour and the tea tasting, we headed to Galle, our next resting point.We encountered narrow, winding, and maze-like streets and alleys in Nuwara Eliya, known as ‘Little England’. The town has preserved almost all its British-era buildings and is calm and beautiful. On our way to Galle, at the roadside, our tour guide stopped us at the famed Sita temple, which has Hanuman's footprints and is the place where Sita, wife of Lord Rama, was held captive by the demon king Ravana after he abducted her from India.We were at Sita Eliya, a temple named Sri Seethai Amman.When we reached the Hindu temple, rich in vibrant colours and architectural elements, it was full of devotees. The water stream adjoining the temple is believed to be where Sita bathed. Large footprints are found on the stones in the stream, and there is a saying that those belong to Hanuman, who came spying to find Sita’s whereabouts.In Ella, Ravana’s waterfalls are significant in the Rama-Ravana story. The cascade charms visitors from all over the globe. The waterfall is easily accessible and is known to have hidden caves at the top, which are believed to have been used as Ravana's residence.The 25-metre-tall waterfall is a beautiful cascade that provides the perfect backdrop for a photo to remember your Ramayana trail adventures in Sri Lanka. A short pilgrimage tour ended there, and it was now time for an adventure. Though it was not part of our itinerary, our guide decided to tour us on a train ride.Though short, only six kilometres from Ella to Demodera, it was thrilling. Everyone screamed in unison like kids on a fair ride to hear the echoes in the dark every time we passed through the tunnels. The sound of the train is subtly different inside a tunnel. For the first-timer, the darkness and shouts inside the tunnels when the train passes would be scary, like a horror movie.The train we boarded wasn’t crowded, but people had already filled the doorway, ready for the scenic journey.With the shrill sound of a whistle, the train slowly pulled away from the platform at Ella, passing houses, coconut trees and green fields.As the train progressed, tourists and locals were leaning out the windows and crowding to hang out the doors. I joined the crowd and hung out on a train. A short excitement ended there.After lunch, we headed to Galle and reached Jetwing Lighthouse. As soon as our group entered the hotel, they shouted with excitement.The hotel is on a rocky outcrop three miles west of Galle. Waves crash over giant boulders in front of it and produce howling winds.We were at Galle’s 17th-century fort five minutes from the hotel on day four. In the Bay of Galle on the southwest coast of Sri Lanka, Galle Fort was built first in 1588 by the Portuguese and lavishly rebuilt by the Dutch during the 17th century. It is a historical, archaeological and architectural heritage monument that maintains a perfect appearance even after more than 436 years.We then reached Hikkaduwa Beach, a popular beach destination on the southern coast of Sri Lanka. On the way, we saw a 30-metre-high Big Buddha Statue. It is a replica of the 6th-century Buddhas of Bamiyan destroyed by the Taliban in Afghanistan. It was created using the earliest known sketches of the statue. It was built in remembrance of the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami victims.We then travelled through the 222-kilometre-long Southern Expressway, Sri Lanka's first expressway linking the capital, Colombo, with Galle, Matara, and Hambantota, significant cities south of the island.On day five, we reached Colombo, the capital of Sri Lanka. Jetwing Colombo Seven hosted us in the bustling capital. We took a city tour early morning and visited Bally's Casino at night.On day six, we returned to Kathmandu early in the morning on a Sri Lankan Airlines flight, the airline that organised the trip in coordination with Jetwing Hotels Limited, a Sri Lankan hotel chain.National flag carrier Nepal Airlines, in its previous avatar as Royal Nepal Airlines, used to operate direct flights to Colombo during the 1980s. However, the carrier suspended operations following an armed movement by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) in Sri Lanka. There had been no direct air links between the two countries for decades.In 2016, Himalaya Airlines started a chartered flight that lasted a few months due to low traffic movement between the two countries. Sri Lankan Airlines started operating direct flights to Kathmandu in August 2021.“The main objective of this media tour is to increase tourism in both countries for mutual benefit. We want to draw Nepalis for pilgrims and leisure activities,” says Nilina Pathirana, Country Manager at Srilankan Airlines in Nepal.“We have understood that Nepali travellers tend to travel to Bangkok, Vietnam, Malaysia, Dubai, and Maldives. Nepalis have quite minimal knowledge about Sri Lanka and the religious connection between Lanka and Nepal. We want to promote Nepal and Sri Lanka jointly. This will be a win-win business,” added Pathirana.The airline said it currently carries 60 percent of the passengers from Nepal to Sri Lanka and beyond destinations like Tokyo, Sydney, Melbourne, and other Middle Eastern destinations. The return airfare for a 3.5-hour-long flight starts at Rs74,000. “We have a four-night, five-day package that begins from Rs80,000, depending on the properties and extended itineraries,” says Pathirana.Nepalis must submit certain required documents for visa processing, like their passport copy and bank statement. Due to this government-to-government policy, only Nepalis must obtain a prior visa. Otherwise, Sri Lankans are required to have a visa upon arrival.“The other best thing is that Sri Lankan Airlines can be involved with the visa process or facilitate the Nepalis tourists. Our main intention is to have a sustainable market in Kathmandu and make it a daily flight,” says Pathirana. \nMundhum Trek in Koshi province in the eastern part of Nepal is a new cultural walking trail. It passes through several indigenous ethnic villages and landscapes in Khotang and Bhojpur districts. This trail goes up to an elevation of 4,200 metres to the viewpoint of Silchung Peak and takes one through the settlements of the Kirati people. This route starts from Diktel Bazaar and passes through beautiful settlements like Chakhewa, Rawa Dhap, Salpa Bhanjyang, Silchung and Hanspokhari before ending in Bhojpur. There are some hotels in Diktel but trekkers are advised to carry tents. The trail offers panoramic views of most of the eight-thousanders, including Everest, Lhotse, Makalu, Cho Oyu and Kanchenjunga mountains. The spring season, March through May, is highly recommended for the trek.Janaki Mandir Janaki Mandir at Janakpur in Madhesh province was constructed in 1874 and is a blend of Mughal and local architecture. The temple is a three-storey building and has 60 rooms, making it the largest temple in Nepal. Pilgrims flock here by the thousands to pay homage to Janaki Mandir—Janaki being the other name of Sita, the daughter of King Janak. The temple houses an idol of Sita which was found near Ayodhya, the kingdom of Ram. The marriage anniversary of Lord Ram and Sita is celebrated in Janakpur every year on Vivaha Panchami, which falls in December. In the southwest corner of Janaki Mandir is the Vivaha Mandap, which has been built at the site where the marriage of Ram and Sita is said to have taken place. Another well-known temple in the vicinity is Ram Mandir, which is built in pagoda style and is hence different from the other temples in Janakpur that generally bear resemblance to Mughal architecture. It houses a female statue, said to be of Yogamaya, which has the reputation of being one of the most beautiful images of female forms in Nepal. Other holy sites of interest include the Laxman Temple, Sankat Mochan Temple and Hanuman Temple.Kuri Village, Kalinchok Kuri village, a popular tourist destination around 150 km from Kathmandu, lies at an altitude of 3,842 metres above sea level in Kalinchowk of Dolakha district, in Bagmati province. People visit the place to enjoy the snow during the winter besides the mesmerising landscapes and splendid panoramic view of the Himalayan range. Kalinchok gets snow mainly at the end of December and the snowfall continues till the end of February or mid-March. When there is snow, it is difficult for jeeps, buses and cars to reach the top of Kuri village. Chains are wrapped around the wheels of vehicles and specially modified jeeps with highly experienced drivers are used to carry visitors. There are several hotels and restaurants in the area. The road up to Kuri has also improved over the years.Annapurna Base Camp Annapurna Base Camp trek, in Gandaki province, makes for a picturesque journey that takes you to the foothills of the Annapurna South, up to 4,130 metres above sea level. The five-day trek (seven days for slow walkers) offers rich cultural diversities, typical Nepali villages and the flora and fauna nestled at the foothills of Annapurna. The distance from Pokhara to Annapurna Base Camp is approximately 81 kilometres. It is among the shortest and most budget-friendly treks in Nepal. For Nepalis, lodging costs around $5 to $10 per day. For foreigners, the overall cost of the trek ranges from $800 to $1500 on average per person. Annapurna Base Camp trek can be done at any time throughout the year as each season offers a different trekking experience. The ideal time for the trek depends on your weather preferences and what you expect from it. However, autumn (September to October) and spring (March to May) are considered the two best seasons for the trek, as the days at the time are warm and bright with clear skies.Bardiya National Park Bardiya National Park, located in the southern Tarai belt of Lumbini province, is home to one of the most elusive and majestic animals on earth—the Royal Bengal Tiger. The park, which covers an area of 968 square kilometres, is considered one of the most important protected areas in the country. It is a prime destination for those looking to catch a glimpse of a tiger. A bit of luck and patience will offer a good chance to see the Bengal Tiger. The jungle safari also offers one the opportunity to spot Asian elephants and the greater one-horned rhinoceros. The rare Gangetic river dolphins are occasionally spotted on rafting trips along the Geruwa River, the eastern channel of the Karnali river. Besides, visitors can enjoy the homestays and explore local Tharu culture. The right time to visit the park is from mid-September to mid-December and mid-February to May.Khaptad National Park Khaptad National Park in Sudurpaschim province is a protected area in the far western region. It stretches over four districts of Bajhang, Bajura, Achham and Doti and ranges in elevation from 1,400 to 3,300 metres. The park can be visited throughout the year. Trekkers are advised to bring their tents, food and other supplies. The Nepal Tourism Board says of late, social media has been increasingly influencing Nepali travellers to go to Khaptad. Since the far-flung Khaptad National Park is still offbeat for many travellers, the area remains pristine and fresh. The seasons of spring (March-May) and autumn (October-November) are the ideal times to visit the park. The temperature ranges from 10°c to 20°c offering pleasant trekking weather. The monsoon begins in June and lasts until September and during this time, roads often become muddy and slippery. From December to February, winter brings snow and chilling winds to the park.Limi Valley \nOnce again, my heart swelled with joy when my hometown came into view.Arriving at Lalikharka after the treacherous journey through Pauwa Bhanjyang and the bustling Kanchhi Dokan, Phidim, the headquarters of Panchthar district, revealed itself like a surprise gift. My home town, Phidim, is unique in the fact that it reveals to travellers approaching it from uphill. As the vehicle descends the mountain road, it slowly comes into view, its houses and buildings recognisable for the native son.This Dashain, I undertook the much-awaited trip to my hometown with my wife Kabita and daughter Aarohi. Little did I anticipate the transformation that awaited me.The moment I got out of the jeep, I noticed that Phidim, nestled in the lush hills, has undergone a remarkable transformation over the years. As I guided my family to my home, which had suffered damages in the 1989 quake that struck eastern Nepal, I found that old, mud and stone houses had been replaced by concrete buildings. The place was vastly different from the one I remembered.Arriving at my childhood home felt like reuniting with an old friend. Navigating its nooks and crannies with my daughter, we delved into the history of the house, a symbol of my cherished memories.My wife had visited Phidim years ago, spending a month with my parents. She, too, recalled beautiful moments she had had in the town. I asked the tenant about the neighbours and acquaintances. Some had died, while others had left for good.A call to local journalist Giriraj Banskota led me to the school grounds, where memories flooded back. This was where I spent my teenage years, playing ball, learning to kick, and watching major tournaments. Here, I even encountered a group of Western climbers headed to Kanchenjunga, the world’s third-highest mountain. I remember being awed by their shiny yellow tents, headlights and strange smell. I remember practising my tutephuteko Angrezi with the climbers. Birendra Shield, an annual sports tournament named after the late king, brought ace players from various schools in Panchthar district. The district also hosted Yuba Mela, an annual three-day fair to commemorate the birthday of the king, organising football tournaments in which teams from as far as Sunsari and Taplejung participated. I never excelled at dribbling balls. A boy growing up in a seven-member family, I soon found my interest in literature. In the late 1980s, Phidim hosted a major literary festival. In the run-up to the 1990 pro-democracy protest, walls were painted with anti-monarchy slogans, local politicians were arrested. I took my family to my school, Naya Namuna Secondary School. It was Saturday, so the school was closed. I peeked through the steel gate and wall, imagining myself labouring over classes. Memories are hazy, but what I remember most is going out of the school—to quiz contests with me leading the school team, to essay competitions at the District Education Office and to play carom board, a national pastime, in a nearby shopfront. Returning to the main street, the demolition of a landmark gate made me reflect on how cities transform, shedding old landmarks for new identities. Navigating narrow alleyways, I felt like a stranger in my own hometown. Multistory buildings have emerged and roads have been paved, reshaping the town. It’s the same place with a different face, leaving me nostalgic for the Phidim of my memories.We finally reached Shivalaya temple, which I told my wife and daughter was one of my cherished hangouts. A giant statue of Falgunanda (the Kirant leader’s birthday is celebrated on November 10) stood before the steps to the temple. Though my wife suspected I came here to smoke, in reality, I visited the temple in the evening to meet friends and talk about issues that mattered most to us at the time. It also offered a panoramic view of the town (I could not take my family to Gadhi Danda, a hillock across the Shivalaya).Towards the end of my journey, I felt sad about Phidim’s lack of prospects. To my dismay, I found that people have been leaving the town in droves. Despite blacktopped roads and multi-story buildings, Phidim faces a troubling reality. The lack of quality higher education and specialist healthcare has driven people away, echoing the circumstances that led me to Kathmandu years ago. Conversations with locals confirmed a mass exodus from the town, a trend that raises concerns about Phidim's future.My conversations with familiar strangers led me to conclude that Phidim has transformed into a transit town for pilgrims heading to Pathibhara Devi Temple, which is around 255 kilometres north in Taplejung district. I met dozens of people headed to the holy site. While pilgrims see it as a stopover, for me, it was a homecoming. The realisation dawned that Phidim is, perhaps, in a state of transition, trading its rustic charm for the hallmarks of urbanisation. While I left Phidim for higher education in Kathmandu, people from rural areas have flocked to the town in search of better opportunities, bringing life and energy to the once quiet community.As we bid adieu to my hometown, I couldn’t help but reflect on the inevitability of leaving a place, no matter how enamoured one is with it. Passing Kanchhi Dokan, I pointed out Kanchnajungha and Kumbhakarna to my daughter—symbols of my childhood. Phidim, now a blend of nostalgia and change, remains etched in my heart, a testament to the intricate dance between memory and evolution. \nNepal Police Club defeated Karnali Province 3-0 to preserve their unbeaten run in the ANFA Women’s League at the ANFA Complex in Lalitpur on Wednesday.Nirmala Upadhyaya, Manisha Raut and Samjhana Lawati scored for Police, who have already qualified for the Super League.The victory against already eliminated Karnali also ensured Police at least a third-placed finish in the ten-ten standings. Police have 18 points from eight matches with five wins and three draws.Karnali are in the ninth position.Defending champions Armed Police Force lead the standings with 22 points and are the only other team to have preserved their unbeaten run after eight rounds.Tribhuvan Army Club occupy the second position with 19 points.The top five teams at the end of single round robin league progress to the Super League, which will be played in a double round robin format. The top four teams at the end of the Super League will play Qualifiers, Eliminator and final.At Satdobato, Police went in front in the 44th minute through Upadhyaya’s tight angle effort after Karnali players failed to clear Ghim Kumari Gurung’s corner. Raut doubled Police’s lead ten minutes into the second half, taking advantage of a howler from Karnali goalkeeper Lila Joshi. The goalie failed to properly grab an easy free kick from Gurung allowing Raut to seize possession of the ball and slam into the back of the net.Lawati added the third in the 82nd minute from another set piece, sending home a rebound after Raut’s free kick hit the crossbar.The remaining two spots for the Super League will be decided in the final round, with fourth-placed Waling Municipality (12 points) and fifth-placed Koshi Province (11 points) in the main fray.Bagmati Youth Club (10 points), Sankata (eight points) and Chandrapur Municipality (eight points) also have slim chances but they could find themselves eliminated without playing their final first round match if Waling beat Chandrapur and Koshi win against bottom-placed Sudurpaschim on Thursday.Even if Waling vs Chandrapur and Koshi vs Sudurpaschim results go other way—which is very unlikely because Chandrapur are struggling with just one victory and winless Sudurpaschim being the easiest target—Bagmati must get past challenge from a relentless APF to progress.Sankata’s hopes hang on a thin rope as they must beat Police and hope Koshi falter against Sudurpaschim. \nNepal ended their Canada Tri-series of the ICC Men’s Cricket World Cup League 2 without a victory after their last match of the series was abandoned without a ball bowled due to rain.The no result gave Nepal their first point of the League 2 following a five-match losing streak that stretched back to February.Nepal have lost six of their eight matches and sit in the seventh position in the eight-team standing with three points. Their only victory of the second edition of the League 2 came in the inaugural tri-series at the TU Cricket Ground when they thrashed the Netherlands by nine wickets. Rohit Paudel’s Nepal lost twice against Namibia and the second leg against the Dutch in the home tri-series. In Canada, they lost the series opener against the hosts by 103 runs and faced a one-wicket defeat against Oman in the second match. Nepal also lost to Canada in the third match of the series by five wickets.Canada lead the standings with 14 points with seven wins and four losses. Oman are sixth with six points. Their match against Scotland had also yielded no result.Nepal next play a T20I tri-series against the same sides (Canada and Oman) before heading to the United States to participate in the US Tri-Series, which also involves Scotland.US are second with 12 points. They have six victories and two losses.Scotland are fourth on nine points with four wins and two losses. \nChandra Bhandari scored a hat-trick as Tribhuvan Army Club defeated Waling Municipality 8-0 at the ANFA Complex in Lalitpur on Tuesday that guaranteed them at least second position in the ANFA Women’s League.Bimala BK and Amisha Karki scored a brace in their dominant display at Satdobato that gave Army 19 points from eight matches.Army have already qualified for the Super League and will now aim to dethrone defending champions and leaders Armed Police Force Club from the top of the ten team standings when they take on already-eliminated Karnali Province in their final league match on Friday.APF have 22 points and can progress to the Super League as table toppers if they defeat or draw against Bagmati Youth Club in their last first round match, also scheduled for Friday.Bagmati beat Sankata 3-1 in the day’s other action to climb to sixth position that also boosted their hopes to reach the second round. However, they face a formidable challenge in their next fixture against a relentless APF.Nepal Police Club, who have two games in hand, have also qualified for the second round with 15 points.Despite the defeat, Waling occupy the fourth spot with 12 points and can ensure a top-five finish with a victory against Chandrapur on Thursday.Koshi are fifth with a game in hand and are the most favoured side to progress because they have an easy match-up against tournament’s weakest side Supurpaschim, who are still winless and sit at the bottom. For Sankata, Tuesday’s defeat against Bagmati is a big blow to their hopes of advancing to the next round. They must defeat Police and hope Koshi falter against Sudurpaschim to stand any chance of progressing. Army are one of the strongest and clinical sides in the league and on Tuesday, they showed their intent for their maiden women’s league title, handing Waling their biggest defeat of the season.Army went in front in the 38th minute when Waling goalkeeper Sanjina Majhi failed to make a routine save, allowing BK’s long-ranged strike to slip into the net.Bhandari doubled Army’s lead in the 43rd minute, sending a low shot past advancing Majhi after Karki set her up.Army went into the break 3-0 up, courtesy of an own goal from Fatumah Nakasumba, who put a corner from Hima Chaudhary into her own post.Bhandari furthered Army’s lead in the 54th minute following a well-coordinated team effort, which was followed by Karki’s two goals in the 62nd and 71st minute, both assisted by Dipa Shahi.Bhandari completed her hat-trick three minutes later, converting a pass from substitute Dikshya Gurung.BK then netted her second and Army’s eighth goal in the 90th with a stunning long-range effort.Sankata were looking to cap a dream season by reaching the second round in their league debut but Gifty Acheampong’s double and a late goal from Pushpa Kumari Khadka left them in the seventh position, three behind fifth-placed Koshi.Senegalese Acheampong gave Bagmati the lead in the 68th minute with a brilliant volley and furthered the lead in the 76th minute with a solo effort.Temilope Jeniffer Owoeye reduced the deficit in the 83rd minute with a powerful shot after Mamata Pun put her through.Bagmati should have extended the lead to 3-0 when they were awarded a penalty in the first minute of stoppage time but their captain Divya Yasmali Magar missed it.But Khadka put the result beyond doubt in dying seconds tapping in a cross from Gifty. \nDefending champions Armed Police Force Club demolished Sudurpaschim Province 19-0 in the most lopsided win of the ANFA Women’s League at the ANFA Complex on Monday.Rashmi Kumari Ghising and Anita KC scored four goals each, while Preeti Rai netted a hat-trick for APF. Sabita Rana Magar and Kusum Khatiwada were at the double; and Anita Basnet, Saru Limbu and Renuka Hamal also found the net. APF’s one came from an own goal from Sudurpaschim’s Sumi Hangma Rai.The win also helped APF open up a six-point lead at the summit of the ten-team standings. APF have 22 points from eight matches. APF are also the team to score the highest number of goals in the league this season, with 46 goals to their name. They have conceded only two.APF’s 19-0 victory against Sudurpaschim is the biggest victory of the season so far. The previous biggest victory of the season was Army 14-0 success, also against Sudurpaschim.Winless Sudurpaschim have now conceded 65 goals in eight matches against their three goals scored (one each against Army, Waling and Bagmati Youth Club).They were also embarrassed 9-0 by Nepal Police Club, while their lowest margin loss came against Karnali Province when they suffered a 3-0 defeat.APF knew Sudurpaschim were the easiest target and took full advantage of it to go 11-0 up at half-time, with their three goals coming in the injury time. Their first-half goal rush also included an own goal from Rai in the 39th minute.Anita KC completed her hat-trick in the first half—her two goals came in the 45+2 and 45+3 minutes—and found her fourth goal in the 76th minute.Ghising, whose opening goal in the 8th minute opened the floodgates, accomplished a hat-trick two minutes into the second half and netted her fourth in the 76 minute. Ghising now leads the goal scoring chart with 13 goals.Waling Municipality’s Uganda forward Jackline Nassali is second in the list with seven goals.Preeti Rai, who found her first goal in the fourth minute of the first half injury time scored two freekicks in the 64th and 67th minute in a carbon copy fashion.Anita Basnet, Sabita Rana Magar and Saru Limbu all got on the scoresheet before the break.Kusum Khatiwada, who replaced Saru Limbu in the second half , scored twice in the 82nd minute and 86th minute, while Renuka Hamal also got on the score sheet in the 90th minute.Earlier, Chandrapur Municipality and Koshi Province shared points after playing a 1-1 draw, also at the ANFA Complex.Sunita Sunar put Chandrapur ahead in the 51st minute but Mamata Raut equalised in the 80th minute to snatch a draw for Koshi.The draw moved Chandrapur up to seventh position with eight points. Koshi stayed in fifth position with 11 points. \nPrime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra and her predecessor Srettha Thavisin both posted social media comments applauding the long-awaited enactment of the Marriage Equality Bill after it received royal endorsement.The landmark legislation, published in the Royal Gazette on Tuesday evening, grants same-sex couples the same legal rights and protections as heterosexual couples.A 120-day moratorium has been implemented to allow for necessary legal adjustments, meaning the law will come into force on January 22, 2025.On Tuesday, Paetongtarn posted on the X platform: “For every love… Congratulations to everyone’s love. #LoveWins”She went on to thank all parties for pushing for the bill, adding that it is a joint battle for everyone. The PM then retweeted an X post from Srettha:“Another important step for Thai society: The Equal Marriage Bill has passed! Equality and fairness are now tangible in Thailand, and gender diversity will finally be fully accepted. Congratulations!”The law, a culmination of two decades of efforts by activists and political parties, was approved by the Senate in June.Its final stamp of approval makes Thailand the first country in Southeast Asia and the third in Asia to recognise same-sex marriages.“The family institution is a vital unit for social development and enhancing citizen’s quality of life. However, the establishment of a family under the Civil and Commercial Code is limited to relationships between a man and a woman, which does not align with the current society where individuals of diverse genders can coexist as families, providing care and support for one another in ways that are no different from marriages between men and women,” an explanation of the law published in the Royal Gazette read.“It is suitable to amend certain provisions in the Civil and Commercial Code to allow individuals of diverse genders to engage in engagement and marriage, which will grant them equal rights, duties, and family status as couples consisting of a man and a woman. This aims to strengthen families formed between individuals of any gender. It is therefore necessary to enact this law, except on matters where other laws already address specific family or inheritance issues.”- In association with the Asia News Network \nIsraeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz on Thursday rejected proposals for a ceasefire with Hezbollah after the United States and France called for a 21-day halt in the fighting that has alarmed Lebanon and raised fears of a ground invasion.“here will be no ceasefire in the north. We will continue to fight against the Hezbollah terrorist organization with all our strength until victory and the safe return of the residents of the north to their homes,” he said in a statement on the social media platform X.He dashed hopes for a peaceful settlement after Lebanese Prime Minister Najib Mikati had expressed hope that a ceasefire could be reached soon.The United States, France and several allies called for the immediate 21-day ceasefire across the Israel-Lebanon border while also expressing support for a ceasefire in Gaza following intense discussions at the United Nations on Wednesday.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, heading to New York to address the United Nations, said he had not yet given his response to the truce proposal and had instructed the army to fight on. Hardliners in his government said Israel should reject the truce and keep hitting Hezbollah.Meanwhile, there was no let-up in violence. Israeli airstrikes overnight hit around 75 Hezbollah targets in the Bekaa Valley and southern Lebanon, including weapons storage facilities and ready-to-fire launchers, the Israeli military said on Thursday.In the latest deadly strike, at least 23 Syrians, most of them women and children, were killed when Israel hit a three-story building in the Lebanese town of Younine overnight, the town’s mayor, Ali Qusas, told Reuters. Lebanon is home to around 1.5 million Syrians who fled civil war there.The Israeli military said dozens of Hezbollah targets were attacked, including terrorists, military buildings and weapons depots, in several areas on Thursday morning.Around 45 projectiles were fired from Lebanon towards the western Galilee area, some of which were intercepted with the rest falling on open ground, said the Israeli military.Netanyahu repeated pledges to ensure that tens of thousands of Israelis evacuated from northern border areas can return home. Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, who heads one of two nationalist-religious factions in the governing coalition, said Hezbollah should be crushed and that only its surrender would make it possible for the evacuees to return.Mikati welcomed the call for a truce but said the key to its implementation was whether Israel, which has been moving troops closer to Lebanon, is committed to enforcing international resolutions.Asked if a ceasefire could be secured soon, Mikati told Reuters: “Hopefully, yes.”Mikati’s caretaker administration includes ministers chosen by Hezbollah, widely seen as the country’s most powerful political force. \nTrade unions will lead protests across Spain on Thursday in an effort to force an agreement between the government and the business sector over a reduction in working hours amid pushback from employers concerned about a rise in costs.Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez’s Socialists are seeking to persuade businesses to buy into a plan to reduce the working week by 2.5 hours from 40 hours that they say will boost productivity.The European Union must close the productivity gap between its member states to keep pace with economic rivals the United States and China, former European Central Bank chief Mario Draghi said in a report this month produced for the European Commission.To secure the backing of employers, the government has offered a hiring bonus for small businesses with less than 10 employees to offset the reduction in working hours while maintaining the same level of service, according to a source involved in the negotiations.Madrid can approve the reduction without consensus and a senior government source said they will do so before the end of 2024.The offer calculates the working week on an annual basis, so workers in sectors where it is difficult to adapt shifts such as hospitality can accrue hours that can later be compensated for in the form of holidays.Spaniards work more hours than most Europeans. According to Eurostat, the average working week in Spain was 36.4 hours in 2023, compared to the European Union average of 36.1 hours.Labour Minister Yolanda Diaz has said that reducing working hours will increase productivity, an area where Spain has traditionally lagged behind its European counterparts.Business owners fear the proposal will mean employees work fewer hours for the same pay as before.The impact of similar measures in other countries is unclear.France in 2000 introduced a 35-hour work week expecting it would create hundreds of thousands of jobs. But data shows an increase in the cost of labour, making French workers more expensive in relative terms and companies less competitive. \nThe United States, France and several allies called for an immediate 21-day ceasefire across the Israel-Lebanon border while also expressing support for a ceasefire in Gaza following intense discussions at the United Nations on Wednesday.The ceasefire would apply to the Israel-Lebanon “Blue Line,” the demarcation line between Lebanon and Israel, and would allow the parties to negotiate towards a potential diplomatic resolution of the conflict, a senior Biden administration official said.“We call on all parties, including the governments of Israel and Lebanon, to endorse the temporary ceasefire immediately,” according to a joint statement of the countries released by the White House.The allies that signed the joint statement included Australia, United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia and the European Union.Israel widened its airstrikes in Lebanon on Wednesday and at least 72 people were killed, according to a Reuters compilation of Lebanese health ministry statements. The ministry earlier said at least 223 were wounded.Israel’s military chief said a ground assault was possible, raising fears the conflict could spark a wider Middle East war.Over the last several months, Washington has been engaging with officials in Israel and Lebanon to reduce hostilities, the senior White House official said.“We have had those discussions for quite some time,” the official said, adding Washington and its allies were aiming to convert those discussions into a broader agreement during this 21-day ceasefire period.The official said Biden had been focused on the possibility of a ceasefire “in almost every conversation he had with world leaders” at the United Nations General Assembly this week.Based on discussions with Israelis and Lebanese, the US and its allies felt this was the right time for a call for a ceasefire, the official added.Israel’s UN Ambassador Danny Danon told reporters before a UN Security Council meeting on Wednesday that Israel would welcome a ceasefire and preferred a diplomatic solution. He then told the Security Council that Iran was the nexus of violence in the region and peace required dismantling the threat.Iran’s Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi told reporters before the council meeting that his country supported Hezbollah and would not remain indifferent if the conflict in Lebanon spiraled.Lebanese Prime Minister Najib Mikati called on the Security Council to put pressure on Israel for “an immediate ceasefire on all fronts.” Asked if a ceasefire can be reached soon, he told Reuters: “Hopefully, yes.”World leaders voiced concern that the conflict - running in parallel to Israel’s war in Gaza against Palestinian Hamas militants also backed by Iran - was escalating rapidly as the death toll rose in Lebanon and thousands fled their homes.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was due to arrive in New York on Thursday and address the UN General Assembly on Friday.LEBANON CONFLICT PUTS PRESSURE ON BIDEN, HARRISThe US administration has for nearly a year sought unsuccessfully to secure a ceasefire in Gaza.The conflict has been costly politically for US President Joe Biden and by extension Vice President Kamala Harris’ presidential campaign with the violence in Lebanon increasing pressure on his administration to find a diplomatic solution.Earlier on Wednesday Israel shot down a missile that the Iranian-backed Hezbollah movement said it had aimed at the headquarters of the Mossad intelligence agency near Israel’s biggest city, Tel Aviv.Israeli officials said a heavy missile had headed towards civilian areas in Tel Aviv, not the Mossad HQ, before being shot down.“You hear the jets overhead; we have been striking all day,” General Herzi Halevi told Israeli troops on the border with Lebanon, according to a military statement.“This is both to prepare the ground for your possible entry and to continue degrading Hezbollah.” A Pentagon spokesperson said an Israeli ground incursion did not appear imminent.As many as half a million people may have been displaced in Lebanon, its foreign minister said. In Beirut, thousands of people displaced from southern Lebanon were sheltering in schools and other buildings.ISRAELI AIRSTRIKES TARGET HEZBOLLAH LEADERSIsraeli airstrikes this week have targeted Hezbollah leaders and hit hundreds of sites deep inside Lebanon, where hundreds of thousands have fled the border region, while the group has fired barrages of rockets into Israel.Mourners thronged a funeral on Wednesday in Beirut’s suburbs for two senior Hezbollah commanders killed in Israeli strikes the day before. Fighters in fatigues carried the flag-covered coffins as a band played. The crowd chanted Hezbollah slogans and some wept.Israel said its warplanes were hitting south Lebanon and the Bekaa Valley, a Hezbollah stronghold further north, and that it was calling up two more reserve brigades for operations on Israel’s northern border.In a video message that made no comment on diplomatic efforts to secure a ceasefire, Netanyahu said Hezbollah was being hit harder than it could ever have imagined.Israel has made a priority of securing its northern border and allowing the return there of some 70,000 residents displaced by near-daily exchanges of fire since war broke out in October between Israel and Hamas in Gaza on Israel’s southern border.Lebanese hospitals have filled with the wounded since Monday, when Israeli bombing killed more than 550 people in Lebanon’s deadliest day since its civil war ended in 1990. \nIn 2008 Matina Shakya was only three years old when she was appointed as the Kumari of Kathmandu. She was succeeded by Trishna Shakya as the new Kumari in 2017.Kumaris are revered as goddesses of beauty and strength in certain Hindu and Buddhist traditions. Worshipping young girls as Kumaris is a 2,000-year-old practice in Nepal. Since the 13th century, when the Malla kings ruled, the Newars of the Kathmandu Valley have been worshipping Kumari, a girl from the Shakya/Bajracharya community chosen to embody the divine energy of goddess Taleju Bhawani. The reign of a Kumari ends when she starts menstruating. So long as she is serving as the Kumari, she is believed to be the nation’s divine protector, safeguarding it from evil. Matina, 18, is now in her first year of college, studying for a bachelor’s degree in management. Her father, Pratapman Shakya, when asked about having a daughter who is the only living the goddess in the world said, “Not having your own daughter live in the same house as you seemed a little unfair, but we feel very proud to call ourselves the parents of the royal Kumari who is revered by people all over the world.”On March 9, 2023, he, along with Matina, were getting ready for a special function held to honour all former Kumaris from across Nepal. “There are often events to honour Matina as she was the royal Kumari, but this one was dedicated to all former Kumaris from different areas. There are 129 living Kumaris in all,” he added. Besides Kathmandu, Kumari tradition is followed in Bhaktapur, Lalitpur, and Kirtipur, among other cities.According to him, this was the first time an event like this was organised and the Deputy Mayor of Kathmandu, Sunita Dangol, was also in attendance.Throughout the year, many people line up outside the ‘Kumari Ghar’ to get a chance to visit the Kumari and get her blessings. Many foreigners stand out in the yard to catch a glimpse of her. Nepali people believe that if a Kumari smiles at you, it is a bad omen.Everyday, a tutor visits the Kumari to help her continue with her education as she is not allowed to step outside the Kumari Ghar. She takes her exams and does her homework from the Kumari Ghar itself. She also has the freedom to play inside the Kumari Ghar. Many former kumaris have pursued careers in their fields of interest or studied after their term ends, and they continue to be treated with the same respect. The tradition of Kumari has evolved over time. In the past Kumaris did not enjoy these freedoms.Because of various superstitious beliefs, Kumaris were not fully educated and were forbidden from getting married because of the belief that the groom would die soon if he married an ex-Kumari. They led secluded lives, were restricted from participating in normal childhood activities, and focused solely on their religious duties.However, now, these myths have been dispelled. Modern understanding has shifted to recognise that Kumaris, after stepping down from their divine role, have the freedom to marry and lead a normal life. The perception of Kumaris as isolated figures has evolved, with a focus on providing them with a more balanced upbringing. There have been initiatives to integrate Kumaris into regular social and educational settings, allowing them to have a more holistic and fulfilling childhood experience. “Matina was already familiar with the students from the school that she attended after her term as Kumari ended,” said Shakya. “The kids visited the Kumari Ghar frequently so that she could have a smooth transition,” he added. According to Gautam Prasad Shakya, who has been living as a caretaker in the Kumari Ghar, the changes made to the tradition are minor. “The traditions of Kumari have mostly stayed the same. All the rituals are still practised like in the old days,” he said.On 6 May 2005, Pun Devi Maharjan, a lawyer, filed a case in the Supreme Court claiming that the traditional practice of electing young girls as Kumaris, or “goddesses’, who are expected to follow certain social restrictions and appear at religious festivals, violated the rights of the child. Quoting Maharjan’s complaint, Puskar Mathema writes in Yuwamanch Monthly of October 2007, “If Kumari tradition is continued, it will undermine the fundamental rights as well the freedoms of children guaranteed by the constitution and child rights treaties. Apart from this, it will have a negative impact on their physical and mental development.”The case continued while Nepal overthrew the monarchy and declared itself a secular state in 2007. When the judgement was pronounced in 2008, the goddess was still in her role, now giving blessings to the country’s President. The court ordered that the Kumaris and ex-Kumaris receive better benefits and arrangements and ordered the government to improve their support and allowances.In April 2006, Prof Chunda Bajracharya filed a petition at the Supreme Court against Maharjan’s petition, who had argued against the Kumari tradition. Bajracharya contended that the tradition should be preserved as heritage due to its over 100 years of history.“People who don’t understand the culture shouldn’t comment on it,” she stated. Bajracharya also criticised the human right activists who contended that Kumaris were only allowed to wear the colour red. “People who say Kumaris are forced to wear red clothing all the time, are the same people who send their kids to schools in uniform,” she said.“After the 2008 court verdict, there have been a lot of improvements. Now, a teacher visits the Kumari Ghar daily to tutor the Kumari, who is expected to complete school assignments and sit periodic exams. All the former Kumaris now get benefits like scholarships and special pensions,” she added.Bajracharya is currently a professor of literature at the Tribhuvan University in Kathmandu.“The only significant change that the court verdict brought to the tradition was in terms of her education,” said Gautam Prasad Shakya, the caretaker. “Kumaris were tutored long before the case, but the case helped formalise this arrangement. After the court verdict, the time between 12 pm and 4 pm was designated as the Kumari’s tuition time,” he added.After the verdict, there was a concerted effort to provide Kumaris with access to quality education, enabling them to develop the skills and knowledge needed to lead fulfilling lives beyond their divine roles. There was also a shift towards ensuring that the Kumari's living quarters are comfortable, safe, and conducive to her overall well-being.Moreover, the selection process for the Kumari underwent reforms in the aftermath of the Pun Devi Maharjan case. There was a push for greater transparency, accountability, and inclusivity in the selection of the Kumari, with an emphasis on ensuring that the process was fair, respectful, and free from undue influence.Efforts were made to support their transition into adulthood, including providing them with comprehensive resources for education, vocation, and social integration. This shift aimed to address the challenges faced by former Kumaris and empower them to lead independent and fulfilling lives after their divine service.“The Kumari tradition has evolved over time. During the tenure of my daughter, we saw a lot of improvements. Even after her time as Kumari, Matina continued to get a lot of government support,” said Shakya, former Kumari Matina’s father.“Some people argue that child rights are being violated, but all of her rights are being upheld inside the Kumari Ghar. This is a unique and respected aspect of Nepali culture, and I don’t believe it violates any of my child’s rights.”While the Kumari tradition continues, its practices have evolved. “She enjoys this normal life and it didn’t take her long to adjust as well,” says Matina’s father, on her transition from the revered Kumari to the ordinary Matina. \nWhat animals did Juddha Shumsher have in his zoo?“We only have records of animals from the mid-1960s,” says Ganesh Koirala, who has been employed at the Central Zoo for the past 36 years and currently serves as its information officer and programme officer. “That too I hand-copied from an old torn-down file that I came across.”Today, the Central Zoo, which sprawls across six hectares in Jawalakhel, Lalitpur, houses as many as 1,298 wild animals of different species of mammals, reptiles, fishes and birds from Nepal and around the world—from tiger, rhinoceros, hippopotamus and red panda to its recent attraction: a pair of chimpanzees.After enduring decades of neglect under various government bodies, with its animals and infrastructure scraping along in a deplorable state, the zoo received a new lease of life with improved infrastructure and animal care in 1995, when it came under the management of the King Mahendra Trust for Nature Conservation (KMTNC), now known as the National Trust for Nature Conservation, in 1995.Today, the Central Zoo is an entertainment venue, one of the most happening places in the Kathmandu valley. Flocked by thousands of daily visitors, the zoo now also hosts rescued animals and those in need of rehabilitation. It is also a site for conservation education.But when Juddha Shumsher Rana (prime minister from 1932–1945) built the Jawalakhel Zoological Garden on the premises of his Jawalakhel Durbar (where Nepal Administrative Staff College stands today) in 1932, he did so purely for private interests—as a space of entertainment and amusement for him and his family.Built in the semi-wilderness of Jawalakhel around a historical pond dating to the 17th century during the reign of King Siddhi Narsingh Malla, the zoo also became the space he could use to show his respect for two women he revered, his mother and sister-in-law, and indulge in one of his favourite pastimes—gambling.Today, the Central Zoo, nestled in the heart of Jawalakhel's sprawling crowd, does not go unnoticed, and its story is well told. But what passions drove Juddha to build the zoo? What was its original layout? What animals did it have in the beginning? And how did Juddha spend time there?“I remember once seeing a small board that read ‘Jawalakhel Zoological Garden’,” Koirala says. “I don’t know whether it was from Juddha’s time or was made in the later years. It must surely be that Juddha built the zoo out of influence from the British given how this term was used by them.”Koirala adds, “There is a former employee, now an elderly gentleman who worked in the zoo in the 1960s. He surely has some stories from Juddha’s time.”Birds, beasts and palacesTo trace the birth of Jawalakhel Zoological Garden, one has to look at the history of Nepal’s rulers owning birds and animals.Like rulers around the world, Nepal’s royalty kept wild and exotic birds and animals in captivity as a source of pleasure and mark of wealth and power. The book ‘Social History of Nepal’ by historians TR Vaidya, Tri Ratna Manandhar and Shankar Lal Joshi details how Mallas during the mediaeval Kathmandu Valley to Ranas and Shahs in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries owned rare, exotic creatures. In 1708, a rhinoceros in Kathmandu Valley broke the iron chain in which it was bound and killed its tamer. In 1714, Bhaktapur’s King Bhupatindra Malla gifted a camel and an elephant to Kantipur’s King Bhaskar Malla to build peace.Among Shahs, King Rana Bahadur Shah in particular was reputed for his collection of birds and animals. He also owned a zoo outside his palace in Basantapur Durbar Square, where the Nepal Bank Limited stands in New Road today. The zoo contained “tiger, bear, monkey, elephant, horse, deer… heron, peacock… pigeon, wild dogs, rabbits, rats, mongoose.”Jung Bahadur Rana’s zoo on the premises of his Thapathali Durbar hosted a variety of birds and animals collected during his hunting expeditions as well as those brought from abroad. Jung Bahadur himself used to “supervise and inspect it”. Juddha Shumsher likewise had his own collection of creatures which steadily expanded into a zoological garden. Seeking wilderness in his Jawalakhel DurbarJuddha’s biographer Ishwari Prasad writes in ‘The Life and Times of Maharaja Juddha Shumsher Jung Bahadur Rana’ that between 1933 and 1940, Juddha shot 433 tigers, 33 rhinoceros and 93 leopards. An insatiable big-game hunter, Juddha had a deep fondness for being in the wild and among wild animals, and from this came, according to oral history prevalent among members of Kathmandu’s Rana community including Juddha’s descendants, the desire to own a zoo.Built in 1752, Schönbrunn Zoo in Vienna, the world’s first modern zoo, was already over 100 years old when Juddha was born in 1875. London Zoo opened in 1828 and Alipore Zoological Garden (Kolkata Zoo) in 1875. Nawab Wajid Ali Shah Zoological Garden (Lucknow Zoo) was established in 1921. Juddha’s inspiration, his descendants say, was most likely reinforced by his tours to zoological gardens during his visits to England in 1908 and to different Indian cities.An article titled ‘Central zoo in state of neglect’ published in The Kathmandu Post in 1996 says that Juddha one day “received a pair of leopards as a gift”, cementing his desire to own a zoo. A report ‘Central Zoo Master Plan’ prepared by the KMTNC in 1996 says that Juddha decided to build a zoo in an epiphany when he saw that some animals “including deer, a few rhinos, and some tigers had been collected from the Tarai and kept in Kathmandu” could be put into one compound in the “lonely piece of land with a large 16th [sic] century Malla period Pokhari”.The pond lay still and serene surrounded by green wilderness ever since Patan’s King Siddhi Narsingh Malla built it in the 1600s. On the grounds surrounding this pond, the Newars from Na:Tole, Pulchowk and surroundings had their devisthans where, for centuries, they gathered to perform their religious ceremonies during Basanta Panchami and Bhoto Jatra even after this area fell within the Jawalakhel Durbar.For the palace, the ground served as its extended garden along with a horse and elephant stable. Subodh Rana, 69, grandson of Juddha Shumsher, recalled his father Kiran Shumsher telling him that Juddha and his family sometimes also used the scenic grounds for picnics. If there was any spot where Juddha wanted to build a menagerie, it would be around this Pokhari (pond). One day, he called his grandson General Maheshwar Shumsher Rana and deputed him to the task of doing just this.The zoo’s layout—except for the small plots of lands acquired later—that was in place when it came under KMTNC's management was, the present and retired zoo officials believe, mostly the same as it was built by Maheshwar and so offers a peek into how Juddha’s zoo must have been like. Pond in the middle of the ground surrounded by enclosures—the southern bank housing mainly larger animals, and cages for birds positioned on the northern banks.From pigeons to the king of the jungleWhat animals and birds did the enclosures at Juddha’s zoo house?“We cannot tell for sure,” Koirala says.Once it came under government ownership, the zoo was tossed from one institution to the other for lack of interest and knowledge on the right institution to manage it. Amid all this chaos, documents were possibly lost and the zoo has no concrete record about the animals that Juddha must have once taken amusement at, said Koirala.Mukti Narayan Shrestha, 82, a retired secretary of the Nepal government, joined the Central Zoo in 1970 as a veterinarian when many original structures of the zoo were still intact. Shrestha also worked with an elderly khardar who, he says, was employed in the zoo since the time of Juddha and was about to retire when he joined.“In those days where the purpose of menageries was exclusively for exhibition and pleasure with no regard for the welfare and recreation of animals and birds, the cages were tiny and iron-barred,” Shrestha says.Elephant, horses, deer, monkeys, tiger, rhinoceros, clouded leopard, red panda, bear, palm civet (nir biralo), four-horned antelope, Himalayan goral, pheasants, Himalayan monal—from the mythical and the majestic, the gentle and friendly to the fiery and ferocious, Juddha’s zoo boasted them all, Shrestha says.Shrestha’s account is not different from the anecdotes passed down to other retired and present zoo officials and the members of the Rana community, who also detail the rare and the exotic fauna, like the gharial crocodile and porcupine, even the jungle’s king—creatures, they say, that Juddha must have received from foreigners as gifts—appearing alongside domestic birds like pigeons.Tidbits of published information also confirm that the zoo had a good collection of exotic birds and animals from Nepal and abroad. One such suggestion comes from Kalyan Shumsher’s ‘Shree Teen Juddha Mahima’ published during Juddha’s reign in 1943.“One need not travel abroad to see the incredible birds and animals found in foreign countries,” he writes. “It will suffice to see [those creatures] right here in the zoo opened by His Holiness Shree 3 [Juddha] in Jawalakhel.”Among these incredible creatures, one reigned supreme—lion, the king of the jungle.For one, it would not have satiated Juddha to build a zoo and not have the jungle’s king exhibited in it. Juddha hence must have done everything possible to ensure one for the zoo. Infrastructure at the zoo suggests that the lion indeed lived at Juddha’s zoo or, in the least, during the Rana regime.“Where bear habitat lies today, there were two dome-shaped attached enclosures with a holding room, constructed in the classic architecture that many enclosures in the British zoos had in the past. They had brick walls and lime plaster,” Koirala says. “These were built to house a lion in one cage and a tiger in the other.”Near these enclosures stood another cage that remains intact today, with the head of a roaring lion carved out of the wall on the top of its iron bars. Zoo officials as well as members of the Rana community believe that Juddha had this exhibit built to specifically house a lion.Remarkably, these Juddha-era infrastructural spaces are corroborated by a rare piece of photographic evidence. A 1946 photo of the zoo shows a lion while a Kathmandu mother and her sons stand in front of its cage.Juddha’s place of piety and playThe zoo was not merely a space that Juddha sought out for amusement and retreat in the outpost of his palace; he also used this place to express his deepest affection.This affection spills right at the zoo’s entrance, in the form of the life-size statue of Karma Kumari Devi, wife of Juddha’s elder brother and Rana Prime Minister Dev Shumsher. Karma Kumari stands tall in her regal costume shaded by a wide canopy. Juddha revered Karma Kumari because it was she who raised him and looked after his mother Juhar Kumari Devi after the death of his father Dhir Shumsher. On another prominent part of the zoo on the south-east, Juhar Kumari’s enthroned statue overlooks the pond. Juddha had commissioned the London-based sculptor Domenico Antonio Tonelli to cast these statues.When Karma Kumari’s statue was unveiled is not clear, but Juhar Kumari’s statue was unveiled by Juddha amid a grand function in 1935 on Jawalakhel’s most auspicious day, Bhoto Jatra. It was attended by the British Resident Frederick Bailey.“On June 28, 1935, at Jawalakhel Durbar… the pond nearby looked very scenic,” says a Gorkhapatra news report titled ‘Statue installation’ dated July 5, 1935. “Because it was the day of Bhoto Jatra of Machhindranath… and moreover since an ideal woman’s statue was being unveiled, there was a crowd of lakhs of people.”Less than fifty metres from Karma Kumari’s statue stands a one-story building with a pagoda roof that today serves as the zoo’s meeting hall. Juddha, an avid gambler, found the scenic semi-wilderness covered in trees and filled with the sounds of wildlife to be a perfect place to relish the game. So he built a building with twelve doors on its four sides allowing him and his fellow gambling compatriots the freedom to enter through a particular door that they thought would bring luck. He called it his Juwa Ghar, the gambling house, and built it with the sole purpose of indulging in the game he loved. Roar of lion reverberates in KathmanduThe sounds of the animals and birds in the zoo rose up in the Jawalakhel sky. Every day, until much later in the 1970s, roar of the zoo’s lion (there were later other lions) diffused to far corners of the Valley, merging the zoo with the spirit of Kathmandu and informing the city folks of its presence.But was the zoo open to the public as well?“I think once it was built, the zoo was open for the public,” Subodh Rana said. “It is unlikely that Juddha Shumsher built such a large zoo and kept it only for his family.”For one, Kalyan Shumsher mentioning that one “need not travel abroad to see the incredible birds and animals found in foreign countries” suggests that the public had at least some access to the zoo. Of course, the Newar community from Na:Tole, Pulchowk and surrounding areas were permitted inside the zoo on the days of their guthi functions on Basanta Panchami and Bhoto Jatra.As the zoo was established at the back of the ground where Bhoto Jatra celebrations happen, it naturally filled with revellers on this day in addition to the guthi ritual observers as testified by the Gorkhapatra report. The photo of the mother and her sons also bear testimony that the zoo was not entirely closed to the public.What is widely believed, though, is that the zoo officially came under government ownership after Nepal became a democracy in 1951. And it would still be a few more years before it was open to the public in 1956.In 1945, Juddha gave up his power and eventually retired in Dehradun, India, where he died in 1952. With time, Jawalakhel Zoological Garden became the Central Zoo. It would take many avatars—a neglected site of crammed, unmaintained cages with sad eyes of emaciated creatures staring from behind the bars, a focal point of animal diplomacy, particularly during the period of monarchy, to, in its recent decades, a space of conservation and education.When all this was happening, the city sprawled around Jawalakhel, subduing the lion’s roar with its noise. More wildlife from around the country and the world came—creatures captured from the wild, those sold by circuses, those rescued from traffickers. Fate would bring these creatures to the care of generations of Kathmandu folks, intertwining each other’s joys and sorrows. After the tale of Juddha’s Jawalakhel Zoological Garden, there would be these stories to tell. Sitting around a table inside Juddha’s Juwa Ghar, Koirala and other zoo officials begin unfolding these stories before me. \nNepal’s book market is no stranger to the popular Bangladeshi-Swedish writer Taslima Nasrin. Almost all of her books have been translated into Nepali, but Nasrin herself says that they are all unauthorised translations. “All books [Nepali translations] are pirated versions,” Nasrin told the Post in a Whatsapp conversation. Nasrin, who is currently in exile in India after facing death threats in Bangladesh following the publication of her novel Lajja (Shame), said that she or her publishers have never allowed anyone the right to translate her books into Nepali. “I don’t know of any such Nepali publishers. No one asked for permission and no one has paid [me] royalty.”Translating and publishing books without permission from authors or publishers is a punishable crime. But Nepal’s book market is full of such unauthorised translations and prints of books written by the who’s who of the world literature. Such endeavours haven’t just hurt the authors but also the readers, says Ajit Baral, publisher of the Kathmandu-based Fineprint publication. “These translations are poor,” Baral says. “Tomes with 1200–1300 pages have been trimmed to 200–300 pages. An example is the biography of Bill Clinton.”Another popular book that has seen unauthorised Nepali translation is the biography of Steve Jobs by Walter Isaacson.“We have no official deal in place for a [Nepali] translation of Steve Jobs,” Peppa Mignone, associate agent of the CAA, the translation authority of the biography, said in an email interview with the Post.The book’s Nepali translation is published by Panchpokhari Publication House. The translated book identifies the translator thus: “Achyut Koirala, who has a master’s in English literature, is primarily a journalist. He is currently affiliated with Nagarik daily. He keeps a close tab on international history, politics and culture and has written scripts and dialogues for half a dozen Nepali films. He has published over a dozen non-fiction books.”Koirala, who admits to the unauthorised translation, claims that he hasn’t just translated the book but has also done ‘creative writing’ with it.‘Rich Dad Poor Dad’, written by Robert Kiyosaki and Sharon Lechter, is among the books that’s perennially on the bestseller list across the world. Upon investigation, the Post found three Nepali translations of the book—all unauthorised. One of them is translated by Dilip Kumar Shrestha and published by the same firm, the Panchpokhari Publication House. Another Nepali iteration of the book is published by Book For All publication and translated by Kopila MD. Yet another Nepali version is translated by one Sudheer Dixit and published by Plata Publication, Kathmandu.In an email conversation with the Post, Ronson Taylor, who oversees the international rights at The Rich Dad Company, said, “At this point in time, we do not have a relationship with an established publisher in the [Nepali] language market. If there are any Rich Dad Poor Dad books currently for sale in the Nepali market, they are pirated.”Basanta Thapa, a writer and translator, says that many books are being translated of late to make easy money. “But how would the quality of these unauthorised translations be!” Thapa wonders. “Readers who haven’t read the original wouldn’t know the faults in the translated versions.” Thapa says that any translator worth his salt aims to ‘recreate’ a book and it takes much work to do that.Taslima’s books are the major victimsTaslima’s memoir Uttal Hawa has been translated into Nepali as ‘Sangharsha’, literally Struggle, and is published by Khoji Publication House. Even though the book in its cover claims that it is an authorised translation from the English version Wild Wind, it is a pirated one. The book is translated by Bikash Basnet and edited by Bhogiraj Chamling. A revised version of the book is edited by Sangeet Srota (Yam Bahadur Chhetri).The same publication house has also published the Nepali translation of the book’s sequel as ‘Prem ra Jeevan’. Publisher Sushil Chalise says that while he is aware that one needs to receive permission from the author or the publisher to translate a book, his efforts to contact Taslima were unsuccessful. Therefore, he had published the version the translator made available to him. Translator Basnet, too, admits he translated the book without Taslima’s permission. “About a decade back, we didn’t know how to ask for permission,” he said.Nepal has the Copyright Act (2002) in place. Before it, there was the The Patent, Design and Trade Mark Act, 2022 (1965) that included intellectual property in its 2006 revision. Even the Muluki Ain (Civil Code) of 1910 BS had a provision about copyright. Moreover, it goes without saying that translating somebody else’s work without permission is immoral.Likewise, Indigo Ink Pvt Ltd has published a Nepali translation of Taslima’s anthology of essays No Country for Women as ‘Aaimai ko Kunai Desh Chhaina’. The book is translated by Krishna Giri and edited by Pramod Pradhan. “I have no idea about the agreement between the publisher and translator,” Pradhan, who is also a children’s book writer, says. “I just copy-edited it upon request.”Bishnukumar Poudel, publisher of Indigo Ink, however, claims that he is still trying to take translation rights for the book. “We translated the book long ago,” he says. “We are still trying to get translation rights.”Indigo is also publishing unauthorised translations under its imprints All Book Store Pvt Ltd, Book for All and Plata Publication. It has published two versions of Rich Dad Poor Dad under those shadow imprints. But Plata Publication is not registered in the Company Registrar’s Office.Pradhan says that many foreign books have had unauthorised translations in Nepali and their quality is poor. Those books are translated not from the original language but from a second or third language, so these translations are bound to have problems, he says. “After I learned that those were unauthorised translations, I have stopped editing them,” Pradhan said.Indian author Shiv Khera’s You Can Win has been translated into Nepali by Bloomsbury India and has granted the distribution rights to Ekta Books. But the book’s unauthorised translations are also found in the market and they don’t even mention the name of the publisher and translator. What is interesting is they mention that it’d be illegal to republish the book, or an excerpt of it, without the author’s permission.The Nepali translation of the book, which was poorly written and rife with inaccuracies, had landed the publisher at court. After a complaint was filed at the District Court Kathmandu in 2066BS on the charge that the publisher violated the copyrights and economic rights, the court had issued a verdict on Mangsir 11 that year, charging a fine of Rs10,000, Rs20,000 and Rs30,000 to the defendants Netra Prasad Pokharel, Narayan Prasad Bhusal, and Bhagwati Risal and Bishnu Silwal, respectively.Baral, the Fineprint publisher, says that international publishers wouldn’t demand much for translation rights given Nepal’s small market, but Nepali publishers do not bother to reach out to them. “Publishers who put out unauthorised translations and sell them at 50 percent discount have troubled publishers like us,” he said.Fineprint has published authorised translated versions of books such as Leaving Microsoft to Change the World by John Wood, Healed by Manisha Koirala, and Hippie by Paulo Coelho. The publication house is also set to release the Nepali translation of Israeli historian Yuval Noah Harari’s bestseller Sapiens. Translated into Nepali by Dinesh Kafle, the book’s translation right was acquired at the cost of USD1300, Baral said. Likewise, the publication acquired the translation rights of Sadhguru’s Inner Engineering at IRS93,000, he added.Baral says that publication of unauthorised translations is an immoral and illegal work. “This phenomenon not just hampers Nepal’s fledgling book publishing industry but also tarnishes the country’s reputation in the global market,” Baral said.Thapa, the writer and translator, points out the lack of regulatory mechanisms in the country. “We don’t have an agency that regulates the quality of translations being done,” he says. “Nobody compares the translation with the original. We need a dedicated authority to enhance the quality of translation.” Universities, Nepal Academy and other stakeholders can play a role to uplift the translation sector, he adds.One’s pain, another’s pleasureWhen the author Suketu Mehta was travelling through Mumbai, a young man approached him with a handful of books while his vehicle was stuck in traffic. Brandishing Maximum City, written by none other than Mehta himself, the young man requested the author to buy a copy. Suketu leafed through the book and said, “This is a pirated copy and I’m the author of this book.” The youth wasn’t bothered and replied, “Okay, you can buy it at a discount.”This anecdote was shared to the Post by Mehta’s friend, the author and professor Amitava Kumar, in an email exchange.Most of these pirated books are imported into Nepal from India while the retailers of original books are finding themselves increasingly in trouble. “We sell original copies but many readers doubt us as well, given the ubiquity of pirated versions,” says Anjan Shrestha, operator of Education Book House, Jamal.Ramchandra Timothy, chair of Thapathali-based Ekta Books Pvt Ltd, said that the phenomenon of piracy has tarnished Nepal’s image internationally. “There was a time when Bangladesh would be known as ‘piracy king’,” he said. “Now there's a risk Nepal would take the crown.”As tax increases, so does piracyThe government decision to impose a 10 percent tax on book imports in fiscal year 2019-20 led to a proliferation of pirated book markets, booksellers say. After the decision, booksellers started to cut back on imports and that led to the entry of a new crop of pirated booksellers, a trader in Kathmandu says. But following widespread backlash, then finance minister Bishnu Paudel struck down the policy.“After the government’s decision, we stopped importing books for a while,” says Shrestha of Education Books. “The import of books went down for about two years. Then the pirates stepped in to fill the gap. It was about that time that pirated copies of biographies and memoirs of Obamas and Jai Shettys became omnipresent in the market.”Pirated copies of classics by Roald Dahl and JK Rowling also made an entry in the Nepali market. Then the phenomenon only saw a rise.Since the customs department does not levy duty on foreign books and also does not care to differentiate between the pirated and original copies, unauthorised books have found a safe haven in Nepali market.The government doesn’t levy any customs duty on books and newspapers published by foreign publishers abroad. The importers should only pay Rs565 at the customs points. But Nepali publishers have to pay 10 percent tax to import books printed in India.James Taylor, director of Communications and Freedom to Publish of the International Publishers Association, says that the government, publishers, writers and readers should join hands to control widespread piracy. “The government should realise that book publishing and reading culture contribute to the country’s economy as well,” he said, adding that the government should seize pirated books and close websites that sell pirated ebooks.Nandan Jha, executive vice chair of Penguin Random House India’s sales, production and business department, says that piracy has emerged as a big challenge for publishers of late and has harmed the authors, publishers, distributors, printers, readers and other stakeholders. “To confront piracy, all the stakeholders should launch a special joint effort,” Jha told the Post in an email exchange.Piracy has proliferated in the Nepali market to such an extent that the publishers of such books and unauthorised translations keep whatever ISBN numbers they like, often conflicting with other books, and still get off scot free. If scanned or searched on the internet, the ISBN number gives details on the author of the book, what the book is about, and its price, among others.Bijay Sharma, information officer at TU Library, says, “Keeping ISBN number at one’s will is illegal. If anyone files a complaint, we can punish them.”By the lawThe Muluki Ain-1910 BS had mandated that a publisher take permission of Gorkha Bhasa Prakashini Samiti before publishing any material. The Copyrights Act came into effect in 2022 BS and was amended in 2054 BS. In 2059 BS, a new Act was promulgated and it is still effective now. Authorities are currently working to amend the Act to give the registrar’s office more autonomy regarding copyright.According to the 2059 BS Act, copyright violations are considered government cases. In such cases, plaintiffs should file a complaint with the police. The Act’s clause 25 has various conditions that amount to violation of copyright. The Act’s subclause A says that if a publisher produces or copies material in writing or sound and sells or distributes it, it amounts to violation of copyright.Likewise, the Act’s clause 26 prevents selling of unauthorised material. The clause restricts the ‘importation of copies of work or sound recording, either made in a foreign country or sourced otherwise, into Nepal for business purpose shall not be permitted if preparation of such copies would be considered illegal if they were prepared in Nepal.’If anyone infringes upon protected rights, they are liable to punishment but the provision’s implementation remains lax.The law gives the authority to district court to take legal action against copyright violators.Advocate Parshuram Koirala says that if the government becomes more proactive, it can punish violators on the basis of the 2059 BS Act and thereby control the phenomenon of intellectual theft and copyright violations. “Creation is a crucial part of humanity’s benefit,” he says. “If intellectual property is not protected effectively, then there’d be no inspiration to create something.”Bal Bahadur Mukhiya, a professor at Nepal Law Campus, suggests the inclusion of rules about digital piracy in law, and also the clauses of various related international treaties and agreements that Nepal is part of.“In the US, a teacher or professor should pay a certain revenue even to photocopy a chapter of some text for teaching purposes,” Mukhiya says. “But in Nepal, those who photocopy an entire book and sell it go scot free.”(This report is prepared in collaboration with the Centre for Investigative Journalism, Nepal.) \nThe election for Sri Lanka’s executive presidency was held on September 21. As was widely expected, Anura Kumara Dissanayake from the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP)—a part of the 20-group alliance National Peoples Power (NPP) coalition—was elected president. This was the first time in the country’s history that no candidate secured the mandatory 50 percent vote to get elected, requiring the counting of second preferential votes. The two traditional political parties—the United National Party (UNP) and the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP)—have been extinct from electoral politics since the 2019 election. Two new parties—Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna, led by the Rajapaksa family and Samagi Jana Balawegaya, led by Sajith Premadasa, had risen out of their ashes. The UNP chairman, Ranil Wickremesinghe, the sitting president who independently contested this election, lost the race. This was not the first time JVP contested the presidential election. Rohana Wijeweera, the influential leader of JVP who spearheaded the insurrection, had contested in the 1982 presidential election and received the third-largest votes. Anura Dissanayake contested the 2019 election but didn’t win, receiving only 3.2 percent of the votes. This election was truly historic due to the remarkable victory of JVP. JVP’s pastThe JVP has been in electoral politics since the late 1990s. It has a violent past as it was responsible for two insurrections—1971 and 1988—that were fiercely repressed by the Sri Lankan state, resulting in more than 30,000 deaths of its cadres. As a Marxist Leninist party, its politics are based on class struggle and found a niche in the late 1980s when it championed Sinhala nationalism as the country witnessed Tamil insurgency. The JVP later abandoned its revolutionary path and entered electoral politics. In 1994, it supported the left-leaning SLFP. In 2000, it supported Chandrika Kumaratunga’s People’s Alliance (PA) government from the outside. The PA transformed into UPFA after it allied with the JVP, which won 38 seats in the parliament. However, this alliance did not sustain. The JVP pressurised Rajapaksa to ban the Liberation Tigers of Tamil (LTTE) and abandon the cease-fire brokered by the Norwegians and the peace process. The party forced him to find alternatives to sustain the majority in the parliament and reduce dependency on them as both contested to gratify the Sinhala Buddhist constituency. In 2008, the JVP split over the party’s support of the Rajapaksa regime.Dissanayake as presidentThe JVP has come a long way since its revolutionary days. After the elimination of the LTTE, it diluted its Sinhala nationalist stance; nevertheless, it is opposed to any devolution of power to the Tamils under the 1987 Indo-Sri Lanka Accord, which it had bitterly opposed. This is one of the reasons why the Tamils mostly voted for Sajith Premadasa, as they were continuously suspicious of JVP. It was JVP that moved to the court in Sri Lanka against the merger of the northern and eastern provinces, which was a major demand of the Tamils and provided under the Indo-Sri Lanka Accord of 1987, leading to the demerger in 2007.Notably, the JVP played an important role in rallying the working class and the poor when Sri Lanka declared bankruptcy to eventually force Gotabaya Rajapaksa out of the presidency in 2022. This protest, or Janatha Aragalaya, as it is popularly known, gave the JVP a popular boost as Dissanayake projected himself as an alternative to the tried and tested political parties. It made corruption its main plank in this election—an issue that aragalaya highlighted, apart from endearing the working class with his pro-poor promises.The JVP’s election manifesto promised to investigate political killings, enforced disappearances and abductions and expand efforts of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission to address violence caused by racial and religious extremism. The manifesto of a ‘harmonious Sri Lankan nation’ without discrimination does not recognise the Tamil political demand. The call for ‘inclusivity’ remains a majoritarian project.Election promises and economyThe abolition of the executive presidency has long been on the cards in Sri Lanka. In 2015, after Maithripala Sirisena became president and formed the National Unity Government with Ranil Wikremesinghe as Prime Minister, the president’s power was diluted and transferred to the Parliament, yet he remained powerful. During Gotabaya Rajapaksa’s short-lived regime, much of the powers divested from the president were restored through the 20th Amendment to the Constitution. So, it would be important to see the JVP’s approach to establishing parliamentary democracy. The NPP’s manifesto promises to end pensions, special allowances and benefits for retired presidents and their spouses and abolish the 5-year pension and duty-free vehicle licenses for Members of Parliament, which the party thinks drain the national resources. It has also promised to keep the cabinet size to 25 ministers. But managing government expenditures and efficient tax administration will likely help President Dissanayake put the economy back on track.Between January 2022 and September 2023, 535,000 Sri Lankans sought employment outside the country, and labour force participation was reduced due to the closure of micro, small and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs). Expanding the domestic market to absorb the youth and increase productivity is a challenge. Government data shows that 49.6 percent of the labour force is engaged in the service sector, 25.4 percent in the agriculture sector and 25.0 percent in the industry sector. Inflation has reduced, but poverty has increased and the negative GDP is growing at the rate of 2.2 percent. Dissanayake’s populist slogan to tax the rich and reduce the economic burden caught the people's imagination, especially of the youth, who are tired of the traditional parties and their persisting corrupt ways. The economy remains a major challenge, however, signs of recovery are present as the International Monetary Fund (IMF)-mandated reforms are put in place. Reworking on debt restructuring would delay the much needed release of funds. On September 19, Sri Lanka worked out a deal with creditors to restructure a $12.5 billion international bond. How Dissanayake balances his promise to provide relief to the poor while continuing with the IMF reform process needs to be seen. To implement many of his electoral promises, he would require the support of the majority in parliament, which he does not currently have. The parliamentary election, now scheduled to be held in November, therefore, would be crucial to JVP’s political ascendency. \nIn what may be the only presidential debate before November’s election, Donald Trump and Kamala Harris squared off in Philadelphia on September 10. Topics discussed ranged from the economy to border security, abortion rights to the bizarre but debunked claims about Haitian immigrants consuming cats and dogs, the Taliban, and Ukraine. Since then, many polls and pundits have declared Harris the “winner” of the debate.What does that actually mean, though? The US presidential debates are one of the major four-yearly “shows,” like the World Cup soccer, the UEFA Euro Cup, and the Olympics, in my opinion. The public continues to pay close attention to presidential debates despite technological advancements, the emergence of social media, and streaming platforms. In fact, two of the three most watched presidential debates in American history took place in 2016 (between Trump and Hillary Clinton, with 84.4 million viewers) and 2020 (between Trump and Joe Biden, with 73.1 million viewers). Debating is in our DNA. Nearly three millennia-old, Homer’s Iliad begins with Agamemnon and Achilles squabbling over inherited authority versus talent. While Plato had opposed rhetoric to dialectic, his pragmatic student Aristotle compared the two.Dialectic is primarily philosophical; rhetoric is political; dialectic comprises question-and-answer exchanges and the rhetoric of a predetermined speech. Debates have a profound history in American democracy. There was no moderator present during the seven inperson for the US Senate between Abraham Lincoln and Stephen A. Douglas in 1858! Each discussion was opened by one of the candidates in turn for an hour, followed by a one-and-a-half-hour rebuttal from the other contender and then a half-hour response from the first candidate to close it out. Howard K. Smith moderated the first ever televised presidential debate between John F Kennedy and Richard M Nixon in Chicago in 1960. The two candidates, however, never interrupted one another, launched personal jabs, or questioned one another’s mental health or allegiance to the country.They never called the other person a clown, a liar, or even a socialist; they never even suggested that the other person was a radical Marxist or a covert fanatic. The inaugural debate between Governor Mitt Romney and President Barack Obama in 2012 demonstrates how respectfully and sporadically they interrupted one another. Has the debating culture become more crude, devious, and uncivilised over time, particularly in this post-truth era? In fact, things were completely turned upside down in 2016 after Trump and Clinton’s awful performances in their first debate in Las Vegas failed to inspire voters. Furthermore, many analysts deemed the first of Trump and Biden’s presidential debates in Cleveland in 2020 to be “unwatchable” because it frequently dropped to unexpectedly low levels. The altercation between the two candidates resembled a schoolyard brawl. The crucial query is, however, can presidential debates actually have an impact on changing voter behaviour? Overall, the answer may be basically “no.”After analysing pre- and post-election surveys from 1952 to 2017, Vincent Pons of Harvard Business School and Caroline Le PennecCaldichoury of the University of California, Berkeley demonstrated that voter choice was not greatly impacted by televised debates. In a 2019 article, Pons was quoted as saying, “There’s this perception that debates are this great democratic tool where voters can find out what candidates stand for and how good they really are.” However, “we find that debates don’t have any effect on any group of voters.” Professors of communication at the University of Missouri, Mitchell McKinney and Benjamin Warner, examined survey responses from undergraduate students attending US universities between 2000 and 2012 and found that 86.3 percent of respondents’ choices of candidates remained the same both before and after watching the debate.Just 7 percent of respondents who were unsure made a choice after watching the discussion, while only 3.5 percent changed their opinions. Well, that could make a difference in a close contest! Who knows? It’s interesting to note that independents and undecided voters, who are most likely to be affected by the debates, are also the least likely to watch them. Indeed, those who watch debates are often among the most politically involved, so they probably already had their opinions formed before the discussion even started. For these folks, watching debates mostly serves as a spectator sport, with little to no impact on their opinions of the candidates other than seeing how their favourite performs.The inaugural 2020 presidential debate was held on September 29. Voting analysis platform FiveThirtyEight’s average showed that, as of September 28, Biden had 50.1 percent of the support while Trump had 43.2 percent. On September 30, Biden’s percentage was 50.5 percent, while Trump’s was 42.9 percent. Similarly, there was little difference in the polling results before and after the second debate. On 26 September 2016, Clinton and Trump faced off in their tense first debate.Most experts suggested that Clinton had dominated the debate. But according to FiveThirtyEight’s poll average, that performance barely moved the needle. On September 25, Trump’s percentage was at 40.5 percent, and Clinton’s was at 42.4 percent. On September 27, Clinton’s polling position was 42.5 percent, while Trump’s was 41 percent. The same may be said of the other two 2016 debates. Nevertheless, debates are important because they reveal the issues that candidates value most, which gives voters hints about how to form their views. Reaction to debate issues and narratives generally drives the week after the debate. Crucially, there are still unanswered concerns regarding the likelihood that any opinion changes resulting from the debate will last.The amount of postdebate campaign communication frequently overwhelms any discernible consequences of the events relatively fast. Furthermore, due to earlier access to ballots in different states, even small post-debate changes could be consequential in 2024. There have been instances, though, where debates have helped a certain candidate’s chances. Ask Barack Obama. In 2008, within a few days of the first debate on September 26, Obama managed to take a significant lead. The Pew Research Centre reports that shortly after the debate, Obama’s support increased to 49 from 46 percent. This undoubtedly gave his presidential campaign more impetus. In actuality, presidential debates can affect voters’ perceptions of a candidate, as demonstrated by the cases of Obama in 2008 and Kennedy in 1960. Kennedy participated in four presidential debates in 1960 alongside Republican Nixon, who served as outgoing President Dwight Eisenhower’s vice president.Though Nixon performed better among those who listened on the radio, a commonly accepted narrative that arose from those debates says that the younger, more vivacious Kennedy gained popularity over Nixon among those who watched the debates on television. According to a Purdue University study, one explanation for this could be that Kennedy “appeared better on television than Nixon.” Furthermore, despite the fact that debates typically have a small impact, 2024 has already shown to be different. Joe Biden decided not to run for re-election after his dismal performance in the June 27 debate utterly turned the race upside down.A few minutes into the debate, the Democratic Party experienced a profound, widespread, and very aggressive panic. Immediately after the debate, some in the party started urging Biden to withdraw from the presidential contest. Though highly unusual, Biden’s withdrawal was a seminal event in American history. From a different perspective, that debate effectively shifted the momentum in favour of the Democrats, which would not have been straightforward perhaps had Kamala Harris been chosen at the outset! Whatever the situation, let’s enjoy how the fantastic four-year show has evolved.-The Statesman (India)/ANN \nPrime Minister Khadga Prasad Sharma Oli was initiated into Marxist-Leninist-Maoist (MLM) politics of Jhapali Naxals quite early in his life. He began his political career by participating in what is euphemistically called the “elimination of class enemies”. He was caught, prosecuted, found guilty of involvement in manslaughter and was sent to rigorous imprisonment. Premier Sharma Oli received all his adult education in incarceration. He has been socialised with some of the most hardened criminals in the harshest of conditions. Adult education in a prison isn’t the most appropriate way of acquiring social refinement. He received a royal pardon after spending 14 years in various jails and came out a bitter man determined to succeed.Once one understands the ‘education’ of the Khas-Arya chieftain Sharma Oli, it becomes easy to make sense of his earthy proverbs, insulting turns of phrases and bigoted expressions. He chooses his words carefully so as to hurt his target without sounding explicitly abusive, profane or slanderous. He once used a Newari phrase, Maka Phui, to dismiss the movement of Janjati because a translated version in any other language would have sounded inappropriate and insulting. He termed the human chain of Madheshis in 2015 as Makhe Sanglo. A literal translation of the expression would be ‘a chain of flies’, but the simile in Nepali language also means the net that a spider weaves to catch flies. The entire Khas-Arya intelligentsia comes out in full force to protect its chieftain with a charitable explanation whenever Sharma Oli spouts any calumny that has the potential of having a double meaning. Unfortunately, what he recently said about Nepal’s land ‘neighbours’ lacks any nuance. Frustrated with not getting the attention that he thinks he deserves, he let out a stream of invectives that were clearly not meant for the Chinese. He said in Nepali that he doesn’t want the relationship to be chhudra and jaali with its neighbour.Clearly, words have been carefully chosen, and sentences meticulously crafted to cover the intended impact of the statement. According to Pragya Nepali Brihat Shabdakosh, jaali can also mean fraudulent and hypocritical behaviour. The term chhudra literally means being mean, but it also suggests being ‘mean-spirited, vile, ignominious and dishonest’. It is possible that Sharma Oli has nothing but good intentions for Nepal’s southern neighbour, but his increasingly harsh statements are unlikely to do much good to improve bilateral relations. The courtesy extended to him for a meeting in New York may just be an opportunity for the Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi to show that Nepal is not yet off the radar of India’s Neighbourhood First policy. But unless the tongue at the top level of Nepal is restrained, it’s extremely unlikely that concerned minds from both countries can manage longstanding irritants.Border rowThe textbook system of Nepal is basically uniform, with a slightly guided freedom for private schools to add some other teaching material of their choice. The Ministry of Education sanctions the contents, and the Janak Education Material Centre (JEMC)—a parastatal with a monopoly over the production and distribution of textbooks—takes them to schools all over the country. The JMEC hadn’t produced a single geography book till the second decade of the 21st century that had Lipulekh and Limpiyadhura anywhere on it. What exactly changed in 2020 that prompted the then Pratinidhi Sabha to unilaterally amend an existing map enshrined in every bilateral and multilateral agreement till then? Other than the paroxysm of jingoism, it’s difficult to come up with a logical answer.Sovereign countries acquire or lose territory primarily through four means—war, settlement, reward or occupation. The last time Nepal fought a war with the East India Company, it lost considerable territory. There has been no fresh border settlement between Kathmandu and New Delhi. Since the Kashmir imbroglio, no international agency has been allowed to interfere in South Asia; hence, the question of a tribunal rewarding Nepal doesn’t arise. As far as the occupation goes, Indians clearly have an advantage at the source of Mahakali. All claims based on the disputed documents of the colonial era are play acting at best.Premier Sharma Oli probably never attended a proper school for long. He can thus be forgiven for not knowing much about Nepal’s academic, official and diplomatic maps that had been in circulation till 2020. However, the parliament that adopted the revised version was full of learned scholars who had attended some of the best universities in the world. When a chauvinistic director also writes the script, fear of being labelled ‘anti-national’ drives all possible dissenters into silent acquiescence. Treaty tantrumsIt’s extremely difficult, even if not outright impossible, to resolve competing claims over contested territories. Irrespective of the nature, no government can afford to appear as if it’s giving up control over even a small piece of land. Despots fear the judgement of history, though King Mahendra apparently didn’t and had little hesitation in bartering away a bit of it to the north and the west to acquire international support for his absolutist regime. Democratic rulers are afraid of the voters’ wrath. All one can do about border disputes is let them fester until the line of actual control ultimately acquires international legitimacy and domestic acceptance almost by default. Unlike the sanctity of territorial boundaries, treaties between consenting countries aren’t written in stone. The 1969 Vienna Convention defines a treaty as \"an international agreement concluded between States in written form and governed by international law”. When ground realities change, competent signatories to the instrument can renegotiate terms, reach to an agreement and decide to incorporate mutually agreed-upon amendments into the existing treaty or replace it with a new one. Such instruments usually require ratification by sovereign authorities of consenting countries.The Treaty of Peace and Friendship between the Government of India and the Government of Nepal was signed on July 31, 1950, in Kathmandu. The instrument has a termination clause: “This Treaty shall remain in force until it is terminated by either party by giving one year's notice.” Perhaps India interprets any attempt at amendment as its termination and is hesitant to formulate a new treaty altogether.A lot has changed in Nepal since the 1950s. King Birendra’s Zone of Peace proposal was meant to circumvent the treaty without terminating it. When the Eminent Persons’ Group was formed in January 2016, perhaps Kathmandu and New Delhi had different expectations from their recommendations. Even though the report hasn’t been made public, the South Block probably expects its contents about the treaty of 1950 disagreeable and has decided not to open it. The clamour in Kathmandu that it be accepted in New Delhi is akin to flogging a dead horse: Unless forced upon one party by another or mutually agreed upon, no changes in bilateral relationship are practicable.Perhaps it’s a little too early and too much to expect that a brief meeting between Premier Sharma Oli and Indian Prime Minister Modi in New York could clear the misunderstanding between two of the closest countries in the world. Ancient ties take long to transform. \nOn Sunday, Nepal’s Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli met his Indian counterpart Narendra Modi on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly in New York. Although there was little in terms of outcomes, it was nonetheless an important meeting. Top Indian leaders and bureaucrats have been reluctant to engage with Oli following his 2020 initiative to insert into the Nepali national charter a map of Nepal incorporating Kalapani. The Indians were also upset, unsurprisingly, when Oli, during his previous stint as prime minister, mocked the official Indian emblem, saying it represented the adage ‘Singhamev Jayate’ (power alone triumphs) rather than ‘Satyamev Jayate’ (truth alone triumphs). Separately, the CPN-UML chief riled the BJP establishment when he baselessly claimed that Lord Ram was born in Nepal’s Thori rather than India’s Ayodhya. So India has good reasons not to trust Oli. Yet the way it was consistently rebuffing Oli’s recent overtures for a bilateral meeting with Modi was unbecoming too. The Indians may not particularly like Oli, ‘China’s man’ in the reckoning of many Indian analysts. Yet they also cannot refuse to engage with the elected leader of a traditionally close partner country. Given the closeness of their relationship, Nepal and India have no option but to continue to engage at all levels, at all times. For instance, Sunday’s meeting may not have led to anything more substantive than Modi’s assurance that he will soon visit Nepal. But just the fact that the two leaders met is loaded with symbolism. India, which claims undisputed leadership of South Asia, cannot fulfil that role by sidelining the democratically elected leaders of its neighbouring countries. Such an approach will also be a mockery of Modi’s Neighbourhood First policy. It is vital for heads of government to talk as that sends a positive message down the official chain of command, opening up many new avenues of cooperation. For Oli, the meeting was also a matter of optics. Just like Modi likes to buttress his image at home by presenting himself as a rock star in his mass rallies abroad, Nepali leaders do so through their engagements with top world leaders, particularly those of India and China. Prime Minister Oli will now no doubt play up his meeting with Modi, while trying to rubbish the claim that India somehow wants to see him gone soon.Whatever the case, it is wonderful that the Nepali and Indian prime ministers are talking. This time, the Nepali side could not discuss its preferred issues like Kalapani and Eminent Persons' Group (EPG). But these issues can be brought up at different bilateral mechanisms between the two countries that the two prime ministers agreed to revive on Sunday. In the larger scheme of things, India’s leadership of the South Asian region has again come under scrutiny following the ignominious fall of one of its darlings, Sheikh Hasina of Bangladesh. The lesson for New Delhi is clear enough: Stop trying to pick favourites in the neighbourhood. That will only backfire in the long run. A better course of action for India would be to continue to engage all democratic constituencies in the region and let the democratic process take its own natural course—be it in Bangladesh, Sri Lanka or Nepal. On the part of Nepali leaders, they must forswear their dual nature whereby they become the most ardent anti-India critics, only to later try to cosy up to New Delhi when it is politically expedient for them to do so.  \nAccording to a recent report published in this daily, at least 440 people have died by falling off cliffs in 10 districts of Karnali Province in the past 11 years. Salyan district topped the list with 117 deaths. Police said six people died in similar incidents in Karnali in the first two months of the current fiscal year 2024-25. A large number of other people were badly injured. Many of them lost their lives or limbs when they fell from cliffs and trees in the course of foraging for grass and firewood. People in this province, which is mostly covered in hills and mountains, often die while traversing risky roads and even while walking along treacherous paths carved into dizzying cliffs. It is a matter of shame for Nepal that a large number of its people are dying in the course of just going about their daily lives. This is not a problem specific to Karnali Province. People are killed in similar incidents across the country. Also, falls are taken as a serious problem around the globe, though the nature of incidents differ. It is the second leading cause of unintentional injury deaths worldwide. According to the World Health Organisation, each year, an estimated 684,000 individuals die from falls globally—and over 80 percent of these deaths are in low- and middle-income countries. A study titled “Fall injuries in Nepal: A countrywide population-based survey” identifies falls as a ‘crucial public health concern’.When it comes to safety measures, Nepalis in general seem negligent and the degree of negligence is more concerning in remote regions like Karnali. This calls for a serious awareness drive in order to make people take precautions and prevent such incidents. There must be more robust safety arrangements in accident-prone areas, and the rules must be strictly enforced. Extra effort is needed when such campaigns are run in low-literacy areas. Youth literacy in the Karnali Province is 66.17 percent, even as the national rate is 85 percent; the population of those in absolute poverty in the province is 28.9 percent, even as the national ratio is 18.7 percent.The provincial and local governments themselves need to devise plans and programmes to address this problem as they understand the local complications, people’s necessities, and the kind of alternative arrangements needed. When it comes to deaths from falls, the priority should obviously be prevention. For that, the local authorities need to devise alternative paths to more treacherous routes, fence off certain places and quickly repair the essential roads. In some cases, they may even need to restrict people’s movements in particularly dangerous zones.As vital is to properly handle the injuries after the incidents and prevent the condition of the injured from getting worse. Right now, many places in Karnali lack even basic healthcare services. Some injuries get worse when people either don’t know how to handle the injured people or don’t have access to stretchers to carry them. Carrying severely injured people long distances for treatment is particularly difficult. Many deaths and injuries could be avoided if only the local health facilities were equipped a little better, both in terms of equipment and manpower.  \nNepal's COVID-19 lockdown accelerated its transition to a cashless economy, bringing benefits like reduced corruption and increased convenience, despite ongoing challenges with taxation and internet costs.\nA parliamentary committee has uncovered a cooperative scam involving the misappropriation of Rs2.58 billion, with Rabi Lamichhane directly implicated in embezzling cooperative funds through his media company, leading to the government implementing the report's recommendations and launching investigations.\nNepal marks its ninth Constitution Day, prompting discussions on amending the constitution; constitutional expert Purna Man Shakya highlights crucial considerations, including broad consensus, a thorough review process, and addressing concerns of marginalized communities.\nNepal's legal recognition of queer rights, including same-sex marriage, is contrasted with ongoing social and cultural challenges, and the narrative of progressiveness is seen as limiting further change.\nNepal's Federal Parliament amended the Enforced Disappearances and Reconciliation Act, aligning with Supreme Court directives and addressing international concerns, paving the way for the completion of the peace process and the establishment of two transitional justice commissions.\nThe Meteorological Forecasting Division has predicted generally to mostly cloudy conditions across the country on Thursday.The met office said that light to moderate rainfall is expected in many areas in a weather bulletin. Thunderstorms are also likely in several provinces, with warnings of heavy rainfall at isolated locations.Likewise, light to moderate rain accompanied by thunder and lightning is expected in parts of all provinces. Heavy rainfall is forecast at one or two places in Koshi, Madhesh, Lumbini, Karnali, and Sudurpaschim provinces. Likewise, heavy to very heavy rainfall is expected at one or two locations in Koshi, Madhesh, Lumbini, and Sudurpaschim provinces.Tonight, similar weather patterns will continue with generally to mostly cloudy skies across the country. Light to moderate rain and thunderstorms are likely in Koshi, Madhesh, Bagmati, Gandaki, and Sudurpaschim provinces, with some showers expected in other areas. Heavy to very heavy rainfall is forecasted at one or two locations in Koshi, Madhesh, Bagmati, Gandaki, and Lumbini provinces.The monsoon low-pressure system remains positioned south of its average location, bringing the country under the influence of monsoon winds. Additionally, a low-pressure system developed over the Bay of Bengal is affecting Nepal’s weather conditions.On Wednesday, Dipayal recorded the highest maximum temperature at 33.4°C, while Jomsom experienced the lowest minimum temperature at 13.5°C. Lumle registered the highest rainfall at 128.1 mm, followed by Pokhara with 71.6 mm and Biratnagar with 57.9 mm. \nGenerally cloudy conditions with light to moderate rainfall and thunder, with a chance of heavy rain in four provinces; partly cloudy with light rain in most parts of the country tonight, with possible heavy rainfall in four provinces.\nAn effect of a low-pressure system developed over the Bay of Bengal will cause light to moderate rainfall throughout the country from Thursday to Saturday.According to the Meteorological Forecasting Division of the Department of Hydrology and Meteorology, a few places in Gandaki, Lumbini, and Sudurpaschim provinces and a couple of regions in Koshi Province could also witness extremely heavy rainfall.“Moisture coming from the Bay of Bengal caused partial to general cloudy conditions on Tuesday in many places throughout the country, and some places of the western part of Lumbini Province and Tarai region of Sudurpaschim Province witnessed light to moderate rainfall with a thunderstorm,” said Pratibha Manandhar, a senior meteorologist. “A few places in all provinces will witness light to moderate rainfall and thunderstorms on Wednesday as well.”The Met Office said there is a chance of heavy rainfall in a few places of Sudurpaschim and one to two places of Koshi, Bagmati, Gandaki, and Lumbini Province on Wednesday. One to two places of Sudurpaschim Province could witness extremely heavy rainfall also.“The weather will remain general to completely cloudy from Thursday to Saturday, and most places across the country will witness light to moderate rainfall,” reads the special bulletin issued by the division.Red alerts have been issued in Ilam and Panchthar of Koshi Province; Tanahun, Lamjung, Kaski, Syangja, Parbat, Baglung and Myagdi of Gandaki Province; Palpa, Gulmi, Arghakhanchi, Pyuthan, Rukum East, Rolpa, Dang, Bardia and Banke of Lumbini Province; Surkhet, Salyan, Rukum-West, Jajarkot, Dailekh of Karnali Province; and Kailali, Kanchanpur, Dadeldhura and Doti districts of Sudurpaschim Province.According to Met officials, a red warning means looming extreme weather conditions. Excessive rainfall, floods, landslides, and inundation will likely cause widespread damage. For the general public, it is a message to keep themselves and others safe from the extreme weather consequences and not to travel in risky zones.An orange alert has been issued in 42 districts, including all districts of Bagmati Province.An orange warning also means moderate risks. Experts say severe situations due to extreme weather events are very likely in the districts. For the general public, it is a message to prepare plans for potential emergencies. As the probability of extreme weather events is high, people are also requested not to travel in risky zones—landslide-prone areas and riverbanks, among others. The department has cautioned the public about risks of land erosion, debris flow and inundation in urban areas and in the Tarai.“Everyday life, agriculture, health, tourism, road and air transport could also be affected,” the bulletin stated.The monsoon season in Nepal generally begins on June 13 and ends on September 23. This year, the clouds from the south entered Nepal from the western region on June 10, three days ahead of the usual onset date. Last year, the weather phenomenon started on June 14, a day prior to the normal onset day.The monsoon season, which delivers around 80 percent of the country’s total annual rainfall, generally lasts 105 days. But, in recent years, it has been taking more time to withdraw.This year, too, monsoon rainfall will be prolonged by at least five days. “We cannot rule out rainfall during Dashain,” said Manandhar.As predicted before the onset of monsoon, Nepal recorded above-average rainfall this season.According to the Met office data, the country received 1,514.5 millimetres of rainfall as of Tuesday since the monsoon entered on June 10, 102.4 percent—2.4 percent above the average monsoon rainfall.Normally, the country receives an average of 1,472 mm of rainfall in the four months—June, July, August, and September. Last year, however, the country witnessed only 1,303 mm of rainfall in the season, 88.5 percent of the average.Nepal is one of the world’s most vulnerable countries to the climate crisis and has witnessed multiple extreme weather events over the past decade and a half.Evidence suggests that maximum temperatures in Nepal are rising faster, at 0.056 degrees Celsius a year, compared to the annual global average rise of 0.03 degrees Celsius.Experts say extreme weather events—excessive rainfall in a short period, continuous rains for several days after the monsoon, dry spells, droughts, below-average precipitation, and above-normal winter temperatures—have become more frequent in Nepal. \n\nBe elaborative as possible.

Though still a developing nation, Nepal was a land of profound beauty and deep-rooted cultural heritage. The residents of Nepal faced many challenges, but beneath these hardships lay a resilient spirit and an unyielding hope for the future.\n\nThis enchanting land, where Mount Everest reaches towards the skies and the air carries a mix of incense and cool mountain breezes, was more than a geographical marvel. It was a mosaic of cultures, languages, and traditions, a testament to human endeavor against all odds. Nepal's history, from the unification under King Prithvi Narayan Shah to its transformation into a federal democratic republic, told a story of aspiration and endurance.\n\nIn recent years, the people of Nepal, with their indomitable will, had taken strides towards rebuilding and reimagining their country. They turned their struggles into stepping stones, each challenge a chapter in their ongoing saga. The shift from a monarchy to a republic had not only changed governance but had woven a new tapestry of democratic values and collective decision-making.\n\nEconomically, while agriculture continued to sustain a large part of its population, Nepal had begun to harness the potential of its picturesque landscapes, developing sustainable tourism that promised to preserve their natural heritage while boosting local economies. Communities living in the shadows of the Himalayas had become stewards of the earth, protecting the biodiversity that made their country unique.\n\nEach day brought new stories. Whether it was a festival in Kathmandu, a technological advance in Pokhara, or a conservation effort in Chitwan, these events were threads in the vibrant quilt of Nepali life. These stories, updated daily, reflected the pulse of progress and the spirit of hope that characterized this resilient nation.\n\nAnd so, as Nepal moved forward, each moment was not just a passage of time but a promise of potential, a narrative of a nation perennially climbing towards tomorrow, guided by the legacy of its past and the dreams of its future.\n\nNews events:\nAfter being ousted from government for the first time in nine years, the CPN (Maoist Centre) appears to be at a turning point as it seeks to redefine its vision of socialism. In the wake of consultative meetings in seven provinces and its foreign units, party leaders have stressed the need for fresh ideas based on the party’s historic Chunwang meeting of 2005 that adopted ‘democratic republicanism’.Until this July, the party has continuously been in power since the promulgation of the constitution in 2015. Back during the insurgency days, the meeting held at Chunwang in Rukum district had endorsed the party’s political line advocating for promulgating a constitution through a constituent assembly. On this basis, the party in 2006 signed the Comprehensive Peace Accord with the then seven-party alliance and laid down arms to enter mainstream politics.The 2015 constitution envisions Nepal as a socialism-oriented country, with the Maoist Centre playing a key role in shaping that direction. But why, after all these years, is the party revisiting the question of socialism?Maoist Centre spokesman, Agni Sapkota, argues that the party has been discussing socialism in various forums. “But this time, we want a more intense and focussed discussion.” Tensions within the party also came to light during the party’s standing committee meeting in August where office bearers openly questioned the leadership of Pushpa Kamal Dahal. In response, the party decided to hold consultative meetings in all provinces to discuss the matter. Besides the provincial meetings, the party also consulted its foreign branches known as ‘pradesh committees’ in India, West Asia, and Eurasia.According to Sapkota, the Maoist Centre leadership got three mandates at the consultative meetings that concluded on September 20.“Besides the need for discussion on party ideology, the consultative meetings’ mandates include improving organisational management and updating party statute, changing leaders’ behaviour, and improving their secretariat work,” Sapkota told the Post. Likewise, another party leader, Dor Prasad Upadhyaya, says democratic socialism naturally aligns with the ideology of the Nepali Congress, whereas ‘people’s multiparty democracy’ is the ideology of the CPN-UML. “As for the Maoist Center, we lack a distinct political ideology clearly reflecting the party’s vision.”Although the party claims its ideology is ‘people’s democracy of the 21st century’, party leaders admit that its impact is diluted by lack of commitment. Party leaders said that there was no call for a leadership change during the consultative meetings. However, at the standing committee meeting in August, a deputy general secretary of the party, Janardan Sharma, submitted a 14-page document calling for a change in party leadership.Sharma and Barsha Man Pun—another deputy general secretary of the Maoist party—urged Dahal to pass over party reins to new generation leaders. According to leaders, some within the party feel that Dahal should not leave a leadership vacuum until a clear plan for leadership transition is in place.Likewise, Ram Karki, the party’s secretary, says the consultative meetings were focussed at preparing a political document that would be presented at the central committee meeting in November. “The consultative meetings were focused on the party’s diminishing influence in national politics,” Karki told the Post. “Despite our party leaders who were in government claiming that they did an excellent job, why hasn’t that reflected in the party’s life? This was a major concern expressed during the meetings.”Karki said the meeting also directed the party to remain open for cooperation with other parties with socialist inclinations. When asked about possible cooperation with the Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP), Karki dismissed the idea. “Lately, there have been some points of agreement between the two parties. But, I don’t see any prospect of the two parties getting into a working partnership,” Karki said. “The consultative meetings have said the party leadership is open to cooperation with socialist parties except the RSP.”The RSP—which was one of the junior partners in the immediate past government led by Maoist Centre chief Dahal before the government was toppled on July 12—appears to be on the same page with the Maoist Centre on many issues lately. But the two parties rule out cooperation on the political front.Party spokesperson Sapkota also says that his party can cooperate with the RSP in parliament on issues of public interest, but there is no possibility of forging a working alliance with the party. RSP chair Rabi Lamichhane, who presented his political document at the party's first national conference held for two days in Kathmandu earlier this month, also hinted at potential cooperation with like-minded parties. Despite this, RSP leaders declined cooperation with the Maoist Centre. The Maoist Centre’s consultative meetings have suggested that the party consider unification with other parties in order to revitalise the communist movement, Sapkota added.  \nAfter deferring hearings on it for more than 60 times, the Supreme Court had earmarked June 5 for the verdict announcement on the writ petition demanding an investigation into a case of murder after abduction against CPN (Maoist Centre) leader Agni Sapkota.The Chief Justice Bishowambhar Prasad Shrestha-led five-member bench, however, postponed the verdict to August 7 and then to August 28. Finally, on Wednesday, the bench issued an order to seek the necessary documents, refraining from passing the verdict.The top court has directed the District Police Office, Kavrepalanchok, to present the original documents showcasing progress made in investigating the case as per its past direction. “If no investigation has been done, explain the reasons,” reads the ruling.According to lawyers advocating the case, such rulings are made at the time of hearing, not at the time of announcing the verdict.“The court had the documents it wanted. I don’t think it was necessary to see any other decision. It is clear that the verdict was intentionally deferred as a senior politician is linked to the case,” Pushpa Raj Poudel, an advocate pleading the case on behalf of the plaintiff, told the Post. “Seven chief justices have retired since the case was filed. I don’t know how long it will take.” Arjun Bahadur Lama, 45, was attending a meeting at a local school in Dapcha of Kavrepalanchok district on April 29, 2005, when a group of then-CPN-Maoist combatants spirited him away, saying they wanted to talk to him about something. The rebels never let him go.A subsequent probe by the National Human Rights Commission concluded that the Maoists had killed Lama following the abduction. His family members accused Maoist leaders Agni Sapkota and Suryaman Dong, among others, of abducting and murdering Lama. Sapkota and Dong, however, deny the accusation. The frequent attempts of Purnimaya, Arjun’s wife, to register a first information report was turned down by the Kavre district police, prompting her to knock the Supreme Court’s door on March 3, 2008 asking for its intervention in the case.The police registered the case after the top court’s directive to immediately accept the complaint and update it on the proceedings every 15 days. Kavre police wrote to Sindhupalchok police to find and arrest Sapkota. But Sindhupalchok police reported that Sapkota was nowhere to be found.Sapkota got elected to Parliament from Sindhupalchok thrice after the complaint was lodged and went on to become a Cabinet member and then the Speaker.After submitting a few quarterly reports, the police stopped updating the court on the progress in the investigation. Meanwhile, in 2011, Sapkota was appointed the minister for information and communication. A public interest litigation was filed by a group of human rights activists challenging his ministerial appointment. They argued that Sapkota as a minister could influence the investigation.Although the court refused to issue an interim order against his appointment, it raised serious concerns over the lack of progress in the probe. The court, however, said that as Sapkota was under the scanner, it was up to him and his mother party to make a moral judgment on whether he should resign.It also ordered the police to carry out the investigation effectively and independently. However, the police didn’t abide by the ruling. On July 12, 2o12 the government decided to stop the investigation and Purnimaya moved the court against the decision. Responding to her petition, the Supreme Court then ordered the government not to stop the investigation process.In March 2016, the court decided that the Constitutional Bench would henceforth hear the petitions filed by Purnimaya and civil society members. Since then, the hearing has been scheduled 63 times.Sapkota was elected Speaker in January 2020. Although human rights activists took to the streets against the appointment, little did it affect the Maoist Centre and other parties supporting him. He is vice-chairperson and spokesperson for the party.As the chief justice and justice Prakash Dhungana retire before the district police submits its report, the hearing needs to start from zero. Shrestha retires on October 4 and Dhungana on October 21.“It is unfortunate that the court takes over a decade to decide a case,” said Poudel. \nPrime Minister KP Sharma Oli, who is in New York to attend the 79th United Nations General Assembly (UNGA), held meetings with heads of government and ministers from various countries on Wednesday and Thursday.The prime minister met separately with Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Qatar’s Prime Minister Mohammed bin Abdulrahman bin Jassim Al Thani on the sidelines of the UNGA on Thursday. Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi also paid a visit to Prime Minister Oli on the same day.Officials at the prime minister’s office said the issues of mutual interests and concerns were discussed during the meetings.Earlier, he met Nobel laureate Bangladesh Chief Adviser Muhammad Yunus on Wednesday local time.Prime Minister Oli said he discussed Nepal-Bangladesh relations with a focus on enhancing energy and transit cooperation and boosting tourism.“Discussed Nepal-Bangladesh relations, focusing on energy and transit cooperation, tourism, cultural exchanges, educational ties and cooperation in regional/multilateral forums,” Prime Minister Oli said in a post on X.Nepal, India and Bangladesh had earlier agreed to sign an agreement on July 28 on the export of Nepal’s 40MW of electricity to Bangladesh via India.However, the scheduled event, which was suddenly deferred indefinitely due to the political change in Bangladesh, has yet to take place.Officials from the Nepal Electricity Authority (NEA), the Bangladesh Power Development Board (BPDB) and the NTPC Vidyut Vyapar Nigam Ltd (NVVN) of India were scheduled to sign the agreement at a function in Kathmandu.It was agreed that with the signing of the agreement, the NEA would export 40MW hydroelectricity to Bangladesh from June 15 to November 15 every year.Meanwhile, Alice Albright, the CEO of Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC), paid a courtesy call on the prime minister on the sidelines of the UNGA.During the meeting, various matters of bilateral interest between Nepal and the US and MCC projects in Nepal were discussed. The US government’s Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) signed a $500 million compact with the government of Nepal in September 2017. The compact aims to maintain road quality, increase the availability and reliability of electricity, and facilitate cross-border electricity trade between Nepal and India.“We look forward to early completion of the project for high-quality connectivity through transmission lines and highways,” the prime minister said in a post on X.The prime minister addressed a high-level plenary meeting to address the threats posed by rising sea levels.Addressing the meeting, the prime minister called for adoption of an integrated approach, a ‘mountain to sea’ initiative in our climate actions, recognising the inherent connections between these ecosystems.“Their coverage should span from Everest to the Indian Ocean, from the Pamirs to the Pacific, and from the Andes to the Atlantic Ocean, recognising environmental and ecological inter-linkages,” he said.Prime Minister Oli said we must take bold, decisive actions to limit the global temperature rise to 1.5°C. “This is not just a number—it is the threshold for survival,” he said.Calling for collective global effort to tackle rising sea levels, to build resilience in our nations, and to adapt to the changes, he said hand-in-hand, we must control release of pollutants that generate acidic clouds and other effects as the pristine glaciers are turning into the depository of various contaminants.“Most importantly, we must deliver climate justice. Wealthy nations must lead from the front to support vulnerable countries,” he said.Likewise, addressing a function organised by Mount Sinai Hospital and AMPATH Nepal, the prime minister said that the disparity in health services between developed and underdeveloped countries should be ended.“There is a disparity in health care and infrastructure between rich and poor countries. Due to financial constraints, the people of poor countries are not able to get easy and quality healthcare services,” he said.Similarly, the prime minister called for global climate justice, urging major carbon-emitting nations to take responsibility for their contributions to climate change.Speaking at the Climate Vulnerable Forum (CVF) Leaders Meeting during the 79th session of the UNGA, Oli emphasised the disproportionate impacts of climate change on vulnerable countries like Nepal.“Climate change is the defining crisis of our time. Nepal, being a country with young mountains and a least developed one, is facing increased climate-induced disasters at a greater scale and intensity,” he said.Likewise, Prime Minister Oli attended a reception hosted by US President Joe Biden.Prime Minister Oli joined the heads of state and government of different countries participating in the UNGA at the reception held at the Metropolitan Museum of Arts in New York.  \nWith the major festivals just around the corner, the Kathmandu Metropolitan City started market monitoring on Thursday. The move aims to discourage traders from creating artificial shortages of goods, engaging in black marketing, and selling expired food items.“We have planned to monitor 10,000 grocery shops operating in the 32 wards of the metropolis,” said Nurnidhi Neupane, chief of the metropolis’s Department of Agriculture and Animal Husbandry. “We have deployed three teams of metropolis staffers for market inspection.”Market monitoring is a regular task of local bodies, which they generally carry out during major festivals. In addition to local bodies like the Kathmandu Metropolitan City, the Department of Commerce, Supplies, and Consumer Protection also conducts inspections, especially in main cities like Kathmandu Valley.“We have trained our staffers for market inspection and counselled them not to harass traders, and have also cautioned them not to get involved in illegal practices,” Neupane said. “We hope that market inspection will prevent illegal activities and that consumers will also be aware of their rights and complain to agencies concerned if anyone cheats on them.”The city office said that traders must keep a price list of the goods before their shops open for customers; metropolis staffers will compare the prices mentioned in the list with those of the goods, storage place, and goods’ expiry date, among other things.Consumer spending during festive seasons increases manifold, and chances they get swindled also remain high.Consumer rights activists say market inspections should be done year-round to protect the rights of consumers.“Every year during festive seasons, concerned authorities carry out market inspection, which is not new,” said Bishnu Timalsina, general secretary of the Forum for Protection of Consumer Rights. “Had they inspected the market throughout the year or made market inspection a routine job, they should not have done so now with much fanfare.”Experts say that, in addition to inspecting the grocery shops, concerned authorities must inspect the source of goods, the quality of food, the price at the time of import, and the market price, among other things.“Consumers in our country are also not aware,” said Timalsina. “Consumers should be made aware of their rights.”The city office also deploys veterinary inspectors to monitor the health conditions of animals, especially goats, mountain goats, sheep, hens, buffalos and pigs during Dashain. \nNDRRMA issued a monsoon alert warning of heavy rainfall and monsoon-related hazards in 32 districts across all 7 provinces, urging precautions including travel restrictions, harvest precautions, and safety measures for flood-prone and landslide-prone areas.\nWaling Municipality and Koshi Province secure spots in ANFA Women's League Super League, while Sudurpaschim Province crash out without a win.\n**Concise Event Summary:** Key events transpire, including a **[Event 1]** leading to **[Event 2]** and culminating in **[Event 3]**.\n\"War, revolution, economic crises, technological advancements, political upheavals, and social transformations reshape societies from inception to present.\"\nNepal's spring and autumn trekking season offers stunning treks to Annapurna Base Camp, Manaslu Circuit, Tsum Valley, Upper Mustang, Dudh Pokhari, and Kanchenjunga, showcasing breathtaking mountains, vibrant cultures, and unforgettable experiences.\nThe displacement of thousands of families in Shuklaphanta National Park has highlighted the recurring problem of inadequate rehabilitation efforts in Nepal, with displaced people facing ongoing vulnerabilities and insufficient government assistance, despite numerous commissions formed to address the issue.\nBang on the banks of the Mechi River, Bahundangi gets in the news each time elephants “wreak havoc” in the village in eastern Jhapa, on the border with the Darjeeling Terai. To anyone following the episodic news outside the village, and in Kathmandu, the elephants are intruders from India, wild beasts with very little regard for human lives and livelihoods. The story is a little more complex than that. In the age of social media, the elephant menace gets ever so magnified. Short videos show villagers running helter-skelter: Helpless men, women and young children trying to chase the elephants away from their homes and crops howsoever they can. The human-animal conflict is never an easy sight. When the elephants then enter the neighbouring east Bihar, local communities in India similarly hold that the tusker trouble has its origin in Nepal. Most of these stories are reported as isolated events; so are the solutions that come into play. Villagers try to chase the elephants away from human settlements and keep vigil to bar them from re-entering their neighbourhoods. In 2016, the National Trust for Nature Conservation (NTNC), with support from the World Bank, constructed an 18-kilometre fence in Bahundangi, right by the Mechi River. But the electric fences can never offer a one-stop solution. Over time, elephants—among the most intelligent animals—find ways to circumvent them. Often, the fence is washed away by floods—as some 300 metres of it in the current monsoon in Bahundangi. In some cases, the solar-powered battery panels are stolen, which can render the fence useless. In all this, the only concern for many local government officials—the CDOs, Chief District Officers; and the DFOs, District Forest Officers in Chandragadhi, for instance—is to hush it all up. To them, the news of elephant attacks or elephants in distress should not travel to Kathmandu. Why face a new set of controversies, get caught up in the Centre-grassroots contest and invite needless enquiries? Any initiative that especially requires cross-border cooperation with Indian officials is even more complicated. What attracts the elephantsElephants can smell maize from miles away and farmers in Jhapa grow plenty of it. Various hybrid varieties now grow abundantly round the year, very unlike earlier when it used to be a seasonal crop. On the other hand, the Darjeeling Terai and further east, the Dooars, are studded with large tea gardens—among the world’s largest. Elephants don’t eat tea plants, but the tea gardens along the foothills of the Himalaya are havens for elephants in their long migration routes in the plains of Bengal, southern Bhutan and Assam.The elephant corridors in eastern Nepal and north Bengal, on the Indian Chicken Neck, are crucial conduits for their movements. The Mahananda-Kolabari corridor links the forests of Bengal to Nepal. However, as water holes, grass, and trees get scarce, elephants venture into human settlements in search of food and water.Further, as the temperatures warm up due to global warming, elephant sightings have been reported at higher elevations in Ilam, which borders the Darjeeling Hills. Among the wild elephants spotted in the elephant corridor in Jhapa, Morang and Sunsari, some are local herds (raithaney), which have been found to stay there for extended periods.Borderland and nonstate actorsBahundangi notably is in the borderland. Family and kinship ties, and businesses are spread across the border to Panitanki, Siliguri, Darjeeling and beyond. When elephants create menace and run into trouble in the settlements close to the Nepal-India border, it is the Rapid Response Team that springs into action, often in the middle of the night. Its members are residents of local communities on either side of the border river. The locals are in the line of fire, and they are the ones who get into immediate action. Kathmandu, Biratnagar and even Chandragadhi are distant administrative capitals. In north Bengal, adjacent to eastern Jhapa, the elephant habitat lies in Darjeeling Terai and Jalpaiguri districts. The elephant population extends from the Teesta River char (sand and silt islands in the river formed by floods) through Mahananda Wildlife Sanctuary and southern forests of Kurseong Division, up to Bahundangi, observes Jayanta Mallick in ‘Trans-boundary human-elephant conflict in the Indo-Nepal Terai landscape’. Increasingly, the landscape, interspersed with human habitations, has become an extensive human-elephant conflict zone in terms of human mortality, crop depredations and loss of properties. In Nepal, elephant populations are concentrated in four places. Bahundangi is the transit point for migration in the east. Nepal has enlisted elephants as protected species under the National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act, 1973 and is among the 13 Asian elephant range states.A ‘mega-herbivore,’ elephants have long-range dispersing behaviour, frequently coming into contact with human beings in the course of their movement. Although their poaching is not a threat in Nepal, according to the National Trust for Nature Conservation (NNTC), elephant conservation is challenged by habitat fragmentation, obstruction of migratory routes and human-elephant conflict. Though the challenge of elephant conservation has been documented in academic essays and journals, its cross-border nuances are not much discussed in the public sphere. Elephants as far away as Assam migrate to Nepal, passing through the plains of Darjeeling. In the process, they pass through human settlements, where they damage houses and crops, kill humans and get killed themselves too.Without a cross-border conservation regime and recognition of the role of non-state actors, such as the Rapid Response Team in Bahundangi and Naxalbari in north Bengal, the human-animal conflict will continue to be grossly misunderstood.   \nOnly one in three 10-year-olds worldwide can understand a simple paragraph or story in their own language. It’s a shocking figure to many, who assume the world has moved beyond problems of literacy and completion rates in schooling. But in reality, childhood illiteracy (or ‘learning poverty’) is as high as 92 percent in low-income countries. And while it’s lower—as low as 8 percent—in high-income countries, the overall rate of learning poverty among young people is a staggering 64 percent globally. What’s more, education is grossly underfunded across the globe. High-income countries account for just 10 percent of the children in the world, but get 63 percent of global public investment. Low-income countries have 25 percent of the children in the world, but receive only a fraction of 1 percent of global public investment in education.Currently, the majority of the kids in the world do not have access to high-quality education. They will never develop their potential to contribute to sustainability, equity, good governance and the economy—the four dimensions of sustainable development. This is an alarming state of affairs. But there are relatively simple ways to address the problem.Walk the talkThe United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) specifically focus on quality education (goal 4). Within that goal, specific targets aim to go beyond literacy, as well as science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) to embed green education, global citizenship and skills of the future into education at all levels.Almost all UN member states have agreed to try to achieve the SDGs by 2030. That means the vast majority of world governments have theoretically pledged to work towards educational excellence for all—with the deadline looming just six years from now. But while we dream of achieving these targets, in reality we’re still struggling with getting kids to read, write and understand maths and science. Even in high income countries that tend to be strong in literacy and STEM, their non-STEM skills and environmental education are still very weak.We are starting from a low base with regard to sustainable development education. The world needs a surge in investment, innovation and capacity to ensure that every child, even in the poorest countries, is given the opportunity for a decent education that, in turn, promotes peace and a sustainable future for all.Last September, all UN member states committed to “continue increasing investment in inclusive and equitable quality education and life-long learning opportunities for all” at the Political Declaration from the Mid-Point Review of the SDGs, co-facilitated by the Irish and Qatari Governments.International cooperation and collective action are needed more than ever. But our existing systems of cooperative, cross-border (“multilateral”) engagement were not designed for the complex, interconnected and rapidly changing world in which we live. It is time for the UN to revitalise multilateralism for a sustainable future.To support this vision, the UN Summit of the Future, which is taking place in New York this week, will consider a Pact of the Future that includes a chapter on Youth and Future Generations, alongside four other chapters. That chapter on Youth and Future Generations outlines key themes of intergenerational responsibility, fulfilling present demands while safeguarding the interests of future generations and investment in a global transformation of education.This Pact also pledges: “We will invest in the social and economic development of children and young people so they can reach their full potential.” This statement puts governments under pressure to provide sustainable development and global citizenship education to preschool, K-12, higher education, professional development and vocational training.SDG4 can be the great enabler of all the SDG transformations to achieve peace and sustainable development. In financial terms, education is also the low-hanging fruit. Universal access to education is the one goal that’s probably the cheapest to achieve and relatively easier to do, but somehow it falls down the agenda. It doesn’t get funded.What’s stopping investment?First, many countries do not mandate that everyone goes to school. In a low-income country living off rain-fed farming, the decision can be to go to school or contribute to household food security. In high-income countries, households want STEM skills to secure jobs. Children are not trained in the skills of the future: the ability to work in teams, adapt to new technology and have empathy for other people and nature.What’s more, governments need capital for long-term investments in education. But governments can work in five-year political cycles, while investing in education is perhaps a 20-year plan. So, it is difficult for them to commit to investing in education, even though it’s the most important investment a government can make.Many countries in the northern hemisphere have access to bond markets and can borrow over 30-year cycles at very cheap interest rates to invest in building schools, training facilities and developing new curricula. But many countries cannot access these bond markets. Instead, they may rely on loans from intergovernmental banks, where debt repayments are high over shorter terms. Allowing access to bond markets and cheap financing over long periods would fundamentally change the face of education financing for the better.Domestic taxes cannot always be relied on to fund investment in education. Middle-to low-income countries have small tax bases. Governments need to build roads and ensure food and energy security and they just don’t have much money left over for education. Nevertheless, many countries could do more, even those with low tax bases.UNESCO recommends states increase expenditure on education to about 20 percent or commit 4 to 6 percent of GDP to education. Poor countries will still have a gap that could be filled by richer countries out of moral duty and self-interest to secure a safe planet for future generations. Currently, the world is not even close to ensuring funding of full participation with good learning outcomes through K-12 into university and beyond.A global investment fund in education can put the world on a pathway that generates more economic activity, equity and sustainability for all.-360info \nEvery year, on the eve of Dashain, Tihar and Chhath, the triumvirate of Nepal’s biggest festivals, market prices shoot up, shadowing the festive mood. This year too, the prices of essential goods such as rice, edible oil, legumes and lentils are already soaring. To make matters worse, both long-range buses and airlines hike ticket prices, making the journey home a financial burden for many. Goods prices are really not consumer-friendly. Even the supposedly low-cost goods from China are now out of reach of many families. Let us not even get started on the price of gold, which only the super-rich can now afford. While it is natural for international trends to influence market prices, the bigger problem in Nepal are opportunistic traders and middlemen who are freely fleecing consumers in the absence of proper market supervision. Take the recent price hike in edible oil. When India, Nepal’s all-important trade partner, increased the basic import tax on crude and edible oils by 25 percent, Nepali importers seized on the opportunity to increase the price of edible oil, even when the government of Nepal had not increased its import taxes on oil. As a result, sunflower oil, which was Rs190 a litre last week, is now being sold at Rs210 a litre; mustard oil, which was going at Rs350 a litre, now costs Rs370 for the same amount. Rice prices have also increased by an average of Rs100kg (for a 25 kg bag). In the next few weeks, the prices could get steeper still. In response, the government has started operating fair-priced shops across the country to help people tide over festive times. However, such festival-time intervention will not be enough to stop unscrupulous businesses from arbitrarily setting prices. Only if there is periodic monitoring of the market will the effort seem credible and businesses take it seriously. Moreover, according to consumer rights activists, just inspecting retail markets is not enough. To prevent unscrupulous trade, the warehouses of larger importers and traders where goods are stocked for supply must also come under regular inspections.Then there is the matter of added travel costs. Domestic flight fares rise due to increased demand during festivals. For instance, the usual one-way airfare for Kathmandu-Dhangadhi is Rs7,900, but travellers will have to pay Rs13,300 between October 10-12 this year. Those who book tickets ahead of time get to travel on the standard fare, but those in emergencies are bound to suffer. Travel via the roads is another concern during festivals as the transport management department, which has issued directives for safe and comfortable travel, has refused to increase the number of passenger buses. This has allowed the current bus operators to overcharge passengers. Ease of travel is a basic right and it cannot be solely left to the logic of supply and demand, especially during the festive times when all people long to be with their loved ones. Several studies, including one by the National Consumer Forum, a consumer rights body, reckon Nepal’s market is comparably more expensive than markets of similar economies. Festive time or not, only year-round market monitoring, intervention and penalties for scrupulous operators can ease the growing financial burden on people.  \nThe Indian government has slashed its goal to create thousands of new tribunals to try sex crimes speedily after states like West Bengal, where the recent brutal rape-homicide of a doctor shook the nation, fell far short of targets, according to three federal government officials and an internal document seen by Reuters.Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government moved to establish fast-track special courts (FTSC) in 2019 to try exclusively sex crimes, after the Supreme Court that year criticised state governments for being slow to deliver justice to victims. The court singled out Bengal and Uttar Pradesh for taking too long to reach judgment on cases involving child victims.Most sex crimes are tried by India’s heavily burdened state courts, but Modi’s government planned to incentivise state governments to establish 1,023 FTSCs by March 2021 by funding 60% of costs. Each FTSC is staffed by one judicial officer and seven support staff.The government had projected 2,600 FTSCs by 2026 but has now revised its target to 790 due to low interest from states and a lack of judges, according to the officials and the document, an undated summary from this year of progress on the FTSC project.Just 752 FTSCs have been established nationwide as of August, according to publicly available government data.Some states were slow to sign up to the project, with Bengal only joining last year. The opposition-led state - whose chief minister Mamata Banerjee is under scrutiny for her handling of sex crimes - was earlier set a target of 123 fast-track tribunals by March 2021, according to the officials and the document.A Japanese man who was convicted of murder more than sixty years ago was exonerated on Thursday after a retrial.But only six tribunals are operational in Bengal, where there are some 48,600 cases of rape and other sexual offences pending judgement.Details of the federal government’s original target and its decision to scale back sharply are reported by Reuters for the first time.Top West Bengal judicial bureaucrat Siddhartha Kanjilal blamed the slow response on a lack of judges but said authorities were working with the Calcutta High Court, its top tribunal, on appointing retired officials to FTSCs.“There have been delays,” he said. “We, as well as the Calcutta High Court, are seized of the matter.”The Indian Law and justice ministry and the office of Banerjee, a vocal critic of Modi, did not respond to requests for comment.Bengal has now been set a goal of 17 special tribunals by 2026, according to the undated government document and a second August 30 summary on the status of FTSCs in that eastern state seen by Reuters.India's strained judicial system has a backlog of tens of millions of cases. State courts of first instance are short of about 5,000 judicial officers, roughly 20% of the judges they have been allocated by state authorities, government data show.In one notable instance of delay, a district court in Ajmer this August sentenced six men to life imprisonment for their role in mass rapes that occurred in the early 1990s.One of the Ajmer victims, who cannot be named under Indian law, said she was abandoned by her husband after he learned of the assault and the sentence from a traditional court had come way too late for her: “I am of a grandmother’s age now and have no expectations or hope left.”By contrast, FTSCs focus on specific crimes and can try them speedily. They are also allowed to hire judges on contract, including retired judicial officers.In 2022, the last year for which comprehensive data is available, FTSCs passed judgement on 83% of cases on the docket. By contrast, Indian courts overall ruled on just 56% of the sex-crime cases taken on that year.The original FTSC targets were set by the federal law and justice ministry using a formula that took into account the number of outstanding cases in each state and a target for each tribunal to conclude 165 cases annually, one of the officials said. Like his colleagues, the official spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorised to talk to media.In a country where cases can drag on, FTSCs “have particular relevance in cases involving vulnerable victims and witnesses,” said G.S. Bajpai, vice chancellor of the National Law University Delhi, who has advised the government on criminal law reforms.Senior lawyer Shobha Gupta, who has represented many rape victims, said FTSCs can be useful but that appeals still go through the slow traditional court system.“What is needed is fast tracking until the last court and final verdict and execution of the final verdict in a strict time-bound manner,” she said.There is no publicly available data on how many FTSC cases are appealed but two of the government officials said it was common for sentences from lower courts and tribunals to be appealed. Nearly 42% of the 1.7 million criminal cases pending in India’s high courts are appeals.BLAME GAME?Opposition-led states have generally been slower to set up FTSCs, according to government data.Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan, both ruled by Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party, have met their targets, according to the three officials and justice department data.But the western state of Maharashtra, governed by a coalition that includes the BJP, has only established 14 of its target 138.The three officials said the federal government had repeatedly urged laggard states like Bengal to sign up, but often received no response.The August 30 summary seen by Reuters said the justice department had written to Bengal on December 12, 2023, advising it to hire contractual staff “in the event of an insufficient workforce.”In 2021, then-minister of law Kiren Rijiju also wrote a letter to Banerjee, seen by Reuters, in which he said his department had sent previous reminders seeking her consent to establish FTSCs.The three officials said they received no response to the letters.One opposition-ruled state that has met its target of 22 FTSCs is Jharkhand.But the state of 33 million has since told the federal government it will pull out of the FTSC program, the three officials said.Jharkhand’s top law bureaucrat Rajesh Sharan Singh said officials have been conferring about running FTSCs that are entirely funded by the state, one of the poorest in India, but declined to say why.“If the state government funds it, we will exit the central government funding,” he said.Chief Minister Hemant Soren’s office didn’t respond to Reuters’ questions. \nThe Meteorological Forecasting Division has forecast the weather to be generally to mostly cloudy throughout the country on Friday.Light to moderate rain with thunder, lightning and gusty wind is likely to continue at many places of Koshi, Madesh, Bagmati, Gandaki and Lumbini Province and at some places of the rest of the province.There is a chance of heavy rainfall at some places of the Koshi, Madesh, Bagmati, Gandaki and Lumbini Provinces and at a few places of Karnali and Sudur Pashchim Province.Tonight the weather is forecast to be generally to mostly cloudy throughout the country.Light to moderate rain with thunder, lightning and gusty wind is likely to continue at many places of Bagmati, Gandaki, Lumbini and Sudur Pashchim Province and at some places of the rest of the provinces. Bagmati, Gandaki and Lumbini Province as well as a few places of the rest of the country are likely to experience heavy to very heavy rainfall.With the high-alert warning for heavy to extreme rainfall across all seven provinces, NDRRMA has requested to take precautionary steps including travel restrictions like halting the night bus services in high-risk hilly and mountainous districts on September 27 and 28.On Thursday, Dhangadi recorded the highest maximum temperature at 33.8°C, while Okhaldhunga experienced the lowest minimum temperature at 19.5°C. Biratnagar registered the highest rainfall at 61.4 mm, followed by Dhankuta with 38.1 mm and Dipayal with 35.5 mm \nWhen five-year-old Dorjee Karmarong caught a cold, his family took him to a traditional doctor who was also a Thangka painter. As a playful gesture, the doctor told young Dorjee that he would recover if he promised to become an artist.Many years later, Karmarong kept that promise. His works are currently on display at the Siddhartha Art Gallery in an exhibition titled ‘Karmarong: Hidden Valley in the Himalayas’, showcasing 27 paintings. These paintings show the culture and lifestyle of Karmarong Rural Municipality, located in the Mugu district of Karnali Province. When asked about his motivation to create art, Karmarong explains, “It feels like we, the Karmarong people, lack a distinct identity. Perhaps it's because those who should see us haven’t, or those who should acknowledge us have failed. Even the Nepal government has yet to recognise the Karmarong community.”He adds, “As the national anthem says, ‘Sayun thunga fulka hami eeutai maala Nepali,’ meaning many flowers in one garland. We are such flowers. Our culture is unique, and we have contributed to Nepal’s heritage. We aspire to enhance Nepal’s beauty through our culture and make it even more remarkable.”“The purpose behind creating these artworks is to let people know about the Karmarongs,” Karmarong explains. In his book ‘Ways of Seeing’, John Berger emphasises the importance of understanding the historical and cultural context in which a piece of art is created. Rightly so, to truly appreciate Dorjee’s work, one must first understand the culture of the Karmarong people. The artist has made this possible in two ways. First, he has published a book detailing the geographical and cultural nuances of the Karmarong community. Second, he conveys this through his artwork.As the saying goes, “a picture speaks louder than words,” Dorjee’s paintings do just that. They poignantly capture everyday scenes and tell stories of the Karmarong people. His art reflects their customs, traditions, and way of life, offering cultural insight.Having spent his childhood surrounded by lush green landscapes and serene rivers, Karmarong’s artwork is also a testament to his early experiences in nature. His work embodies ecological aesthetics, showcasing the beauty of the natural world.“Many people overlook the small details in Thangka art. Through this solo exhibition, I’ve aimed to highlight the unrecorded stories of the Karmarong people—their history, culture, and religious practices—by bringing them into the public eye,” he says.As you enter the gallery, an artwork of a family of three captures your attention. My conversation with Karmarong, especially about the journey that shaped him into the artist he is today, became essential to understanding the significance of this piece.The painting of the family, dressed in traditional Tibetan attire, shows the mother carrying a doko, with the father and son walking behind her. This scene symbolises Karmarong’s childhood and reflects his parents’ experiences as rural migrant workers. They would trek on foot over the mountains from Koskar, Himachal Pradesh, back to their village in western Nepal.The following artworks form a series connecting Karmarong to his childhood in the village. Through these pieces, he skillfully presents an autobiographical depiction of his early years, using personal iconography to explore and express his formative experiences.Another feature of the artwork is the portrayal of yaks. Influenced by the Karmarong people's strong belief in Dharma and Karma, the yaks, depicted carrying goods on their backs, symbolise how these spiritual principles extend beyond humans, even guiding and influencing the lives of animals.Inspired by his childhood experiences, Karmarong created a piece titled ‘The Yak and His Young Keeper’. This artwork reflects his journey of learning Thangka art during his apprenticeship with Master Palden, where he mastered the geometric principles of Tibetan iconography. As Palden’s student, Dorjee also learned to blend modern styles with traditional Thangka techniques, allowing him to innovate and express himself more freely in his art. Two of his abstract paintings showcase these traits. The first, titled ‘The Dance of Elements’, incorporates the five elements of nature and features a monstrous face split into orange and black hues. Its pink hand clutches a cigarette-like object coiled by snakes.When asked about his interpretation of the artwork, Karmarong explained that it reflects nature's duality: its beauty and peril. He emphasised that mismanaging our natural resources can lead to destruction. The depiction of various wild animals and bombs serves as a reminder of the consequences of our actions toward nature. Similarly, his other painting, ‘The Beauty of a Flawed World’, features geometric shapes and upside-down alphabets.“We often criticise things that aren’t arranged in a proper order. Through this painting, I want to convey that beauty can be found anywhere. Everything doesn’t need to be perfectly aligned; it’s about one’s perspective and how they view the world,” he says.Similarly, Karmarong intertwines the narratives of Buddhist and Tibetan mythologies by showcasing various monuments in his art. One feature in his paintings is a three-story structure resembling a house known as Kangni, which serves as a recurring motif. Referred to as the ‘Gate of Virtue’, this structure is built on a raised platform two meters off the ground with a mandala ceiling. The walls surrounding the Kangni illustrate the life of Lord Buddha. According to legend, when Rinpoche witnessed his daughter placing a stone in a sacred spot, he encouraged its reverence. Since that moment, people have started bowing to the stone in hopes of receiving blessings.After watching ‘Shambhala’, I couldn’t help but notice similarities between the film’s imagery and the artist’s artistic creations, particularly in the portrayal of the monastery. Hearing Karmarong narrate myth stories transports the listeners back to their childhood when the days were filled with tales and fables of the past.The exhibition also highlights the intriguing story of the monasteries' origins. The tale of Valmo Tsering narrates the myth associated with these origins. According to the legend, a she-spirit with long breasts would chase after young animal herders at the foot of a village. In response, a Lama placed two large boulders on her, resulting in her demise. To honour the Lama, the villagers constructed a monastery. Today, remnants of this site, including a stupa and parts of the old monastery, are still visible.In his artwork, Karmarong employs acrylic on cotton and a vibrant colour palette dominated by the natural hues of blue, green, and brown. The composition features a goreto bato, similar to those found in the village, allowing viewers to experience the art as if gazing at the region’s scenic landscapes. The painting instils a sense of wonder and admiration, inviting viewers to appreciate the lush greenery and natural beauty of Nepal’s often overlooked places.Moreover, the painting captures the artist’s love for his roots and heritage, showcasing his effort to bring his culture to the forefront.In this way, for over 20 years, Karmarong has painted Thangkas and exhibited his work in various countries. He also believes that his journey as an artist may be linked to Karma. A lama suggests that he may be the reincarnation of a yogi from Karmarong who struggled to find an artist to assist in constructing a monastery. The yogi had vowed to be reborn as an artist, and Karmarong deeply resonates with this story, believing that he is fulfilling the yogi’s mission in this lifetime.Therefore, his solo art exhibition is the story of a spiritual and artistic evolution. Each piece represents not only his personal growth as an artist but also the fulfilment of a karmic vow made by a yogi.Karmarong: Hidden Valley in the HimalayasWhere: Siddhartha Art Gallery, Baber MahalWhen: September 24 to October 21Time: Sunday to Friday: 11:00 am to 5:00 pm, Saturday 12:00 pm to 5:00 pmEntry: Free \n\nThe year-on-year consumer price inflation stood at 4.1 percent in mid-August compared to 7.52 percent a year ago, nearly half, as non-food and service inflation dived to just 2.94 percent.Experts say this is expected in rapidly growing low-income countries, as people with rising incomes consume more food and drive up food prices relative to the prices of other goods. According to the central bank report released on Thursday, the food and beverage inflation stood at 6.17 percent in the review month.Under the food and beverage category, the year-on-year price index of the vegetable sub-category increased 19.07 percent, pulses and legumes 12.09 percent, cereal grains and their products 9.15 percent, and milk products and eggs 3.66 percent.Nepal Rastra Bank said it updated the consumer price index (CPI) base year to 2023-24. Before this, the base year was 2014-15. In the updated consumer price index, the weight for the food and beverage group is 35.49 percent, and for the non-food and services group is 64.51 percent. In the base year 2014-15, the total weight of the food and beverage group was 43.91 percent, while the total weight of the non-food and services group was 56.09 percent.So, according to analysts, a drop in non-food and services groups pulls the overall inflation.As a result, the public doesn’t believe in the overall inflation rate worked out by the central bank as they say foods have become very expensive.“That’s a wrong statement,” said Ramu Paudel, spokesperson for the Nepal Rastra Bank. “We calculate inflation with our methodology.”Manbar Singh Khadka, an economist at the Asian Development Bank, said on Tuesday that since nearly 60 percent of Nepal’s imports are from India, the Indian price index is appropriate for comparison with Nepal’s consumer price index.“As transportation costs are added, Nepal has a slightly high inflation rate.”In India, inflation eased from 3.55 percent in July 2024 to 3.26 percent in August. In Nepal, it increased slightly, from 3.57 percent in mid-July to 4.1 percent in mid-August.Nepal has an open border with India, facilitating the free movement of goods, and a hard peg to the Indian rupee. Thus, inflation shocks from India are transmitted to Nepal through trade and exchange rate channels. Even though Nepal tries to retain domestic monetary control to some extent at the expense of financial openness, having a fixed exchange rate and an open border limits the policy's response to inflationary pressures, according to the International Monetary Fund. According to the central bank, the updated index puts alcoholic drinks, tobacco products, and restaurants and hotels in the non-food and services group in accordance with the Classification of Individual Consumption by Purpose 2018 standard.The prices of 525 items are collected from a weighted basket of 249 commodities to compute the price index. Of these, the prices of 59 items are recorded weekly, 94 monthly, and 372 quarterly.For the first time, the central bank has computed the price index at the provincial level. Eighty-seven market centres have been selected for data collection across all 77 districts, including 28 from the Tarai, 43 from the hills, and 16 from the mountain region. Among these, 21 are rural market centres while 66 are urban. These market centres number 15 in Koshi, 12 in Madhesh, 16 in Bagmati, 11 in Gandaki, 13 in Lumbini, and 10 in Karnali and Sudurpaschim.According to the new inflation data, consumer prices remain high in the Sudurpaschim province at 6.69 percent, while the Karnali province recorded the lowest at 3.46 percent in mid-July to mid-August.“As the updated index has added new goods with price data from all 77 districts, the inflation report will be more representative and inclusive,” said Paudel. “Also, the goods on the index include their consumption by all income groups.”No theory says that the inflation in the market and the inflation report of the central bank should match, Paudel argues. Before the update, the central bank collected data from 50 districts. \nPrime Minister KP Sharma Oli has stressed Nepal’s commitment to resolving its long-standing transitional justice issues.Addressing the 79th session of the United Nations General Assembly in New York, the prime minister outlined Nepal’s efforts to address the transitional justice process. “Parliament has passed a Transitional Justice bill to settle the issue once and for all,” Prime Minister Oli told the Assembly, underscoring his government’s commitment to bringing closure to the conflict era.The new law, he said, is designed to uphold victims’ rights by ensuring they receive truth and justice, while also providing a path for reconciliation.Prime Minister Oli said that reparations and reconciliation are crucial to healing the “wounds and scars” left by the conflict. “We will use reparations and reconciliation to heal the wounds and scars of the conflict period,” he said.The prime minister reaffirmed his government’s intention to expedite the peace process and secure political stability, noting that the transitional justice mechanism is central to this effort.Oli expressed appreciation for the international support Nepal has received in dealing with its transitional justice issues, including assistance from the United Nations. “We appreciate support from the international community, including the UN system, in this regard,” he said.In addition to transitional justice, Prime Minister Oli highlighted the escalating threat of climate change, which he described as one of the most pressing global challenges.He called for “climate justice” for nations like Nepal, which contribute little to global emissions but bear a disproportionate share of the consequences.Oli drew attention to the alarming rate at which Nepal’s Himalayan glaciers—often referred to as the “Third Pole”—are melting.“This loss of ice not only threatens water availability for billions of people in downstream countries but also poses a significant environmental risk, he said. “Of utmost concern is the alarming rate at which the pristine Himalayas, often referred to as the Third Pole, are losing their vast snow reserves.”The prime minister said that Nepal’s Himalayas play a critical role in regulating global climate patterns, with their snow-fed rivers flowing into major oceans and contributing to climate stability.Prime Minister Oli reiterated Nepal’s call for stronger international action on the issue, including the need for a dedicated “Loss and Damage” fund to support countries like Nepal in implementing climate-resilient measures and infrastructure.He also called for greater focus on the mountain agenda in international climate negotiations, pointing out that Nepal’s mountainous regions are vital not only for the local population but for the global ecosystem.“Nepal’s Himalayas, as a natural climate stabiliser, help maintain a cooling system in a region situated in the hottest zone of the planet,” he said, urging global leaders to pay greater attention to the unique challenges faced by mountainous nations in the fight against climate change.Reaffirming Nepal’s commitment to the Paris Agreement, Oli outlined the country’s target to achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2045, five years ahead of the global goal. “Nepal is steadfast in its commitment to the Paris Agreement and aims to achieve net zero by 2045,” he said, stressing that collective global efforts are required to tackle the climate crisis effectively.He also reaffirmed Nepal’s commitment to international peace, noting the country’s contributions to United Nations peacekeeping missions and its advocacy for global disarmament. \nMinister for Foreign Affairs Arzu Rana Deuba has urged the G20 member countries to increase financial support for Least Developed Countries (LDCs) to address the damaging impacts of climate change.Reflecting on the problems LDCs face due to climate change, Minister Rana said, “These countries have suffered from multi-faceted crises, including the Covid-19 pandemic, climate change, and geopolitical tensions. As a result, these countries have been pushed further into extreme poverty in the last two decades.”She was addressing the G20 Foreign Affairs Ministers Meeting in New York on Wednesday on the sidelines of the 79th Session of the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA). Minister Rana made these remarks on behalf of the Group of Least-Developed Countries, of which Nepal is the current chair.The minister urged the G20 nations to take a leading role in promoting inclusive growth, accelerating the 2030 Agenda, enhancing global health security, leading climate action, driving digital transformation, bridging digital divides, fostering multilateral cooperation, and addressing the challenges the world faces.She lauded Brazil’ s initiatives in hosting the meeting as the chair of the G20 with a focus on social inclusion, poverty alleviation and sustainable development while welcoming its proposal to launch a Global Alliance against Hunger and Poverty.Minister Rana urged the establishment of a formal mechanism for LDC representation in G20 meetings and working groups, including regular invitations for the LDC chair to G20 Summits, which she said provides a vital platform for allowing the perspectives of LDCs to shape G20 deliberations and outcomes.Likewise, she requested the establishment of a G20-led fund to support climate adaptation and resilience-building in LDCs, with a focus on grant-based financing and capacity building for project development and implementation.She also called on G20 members to provide duty-free and quota-free market access for products from all the LDC countries, which she believed would help LDCs better integrate into global venue chains and boost export revenues.She stressed the urgent need for G20 countries to recognise that LDCs have been severely hit by the recent increase in extreme poverty, calling for collective efforts to support these countries. \nDean Richard Thompson recently completed his two years as the American ambassador to Nepal. Arriving here just before the 2022 elections, he has since closely observed Nepali politics and society. Umesh Chauhan and Biswas Baral recently sat down with Thompson to reflect on his time in Nepal, major US projects in the country including those under the MCC, geopolitical competition with China, trade, and a range of other issues.How have you seen Nepali politics evolve in the two years you have been in the country? What events stood out? I’ve seen a lot of Nepali politics. Obviously, there’s been a lot of changes. I got here right before the national elections in November 2022. It was really great to see the democratic process play out here, to see Nepalis turn out in such great numbers and make their choices known.Democracy is such a vibrant and colourful exercise anywhere in the world. Nepal did not disappoint on that front. It's been fascinating to watch it evolve, to watch the governments come in different formations.What’s been great is the commitment we’ve seen from successive groups in government to moving forward and carrying forward the [bilateral] partnership and building on projects. I’ve also been amazed at some of the innovative things happening in various sectors of the economy.There has been some very exciting work in the IT sector, for example, that runs the gamut from more traditional back-office type operations to cutting-edge AI research, to developing educational apps for school students, to things like what we have been sponsoring at our Content Creator’s Mela these past two years. It is great to see Nepalis show lots of creativity in expressing themselves and talking about their culture and their society in so many different ways. Across the board, I’d say the experience has been unique.How have the Nepal-US relations evolved over the past 77 years of diplomatic ties? What are the salient features of the relationship? What I would say is we’ve always tried to listen, to engage with the Nepali society. Based on that, I think one of the things that we’ve done is refine the range of products.The Peace Corps, the USAID, the Millennium Challenge Corporation, the Development Finance Corporation, or other elements of our assistance and development commitments—these are different tools that can be employed. And Nepal has continually expanded its capacity to take advantage of them. The US has been able to increase the number of tools and assets, if you will, that Nepal can use to build its economy.I’m very proud of the fact that we have done this primarily through grant-based assistance, so that there is little in terms of downsides. At the same time, we have focused on different segments of the economy or society, for example, through the Development Finance Corporation, we’re now able to target and work with the financial sector to create more opportunities for small and medium-sized enterprises, particularly women-run enterprises. Through the USAID, we can use more of the traditional mechanisms of assistance.The Millennium Challenge Corporation kind of speaks for itself. It targets large-scale, massive infrastructure type projects that aim to be transformative in terms of Nepal’s economy. It has helped grow the road and infrastructure network and show new technology that can help expand that network and make roads safer, more reliable, and easier to maintain. It has helped build an electricity infrastructure that allows Nepal, first and foremost, to internally use the green hydropower that's at its disposal, but there will be excess capacity even to export it to the region to earn additional income. So I’m pretty excited about what I’ve seen happen over the past 77 years, and where we are today. I’m also extremely positive about building on where we are now. Can you give us a status of the implementation of projects under the Millennium Challenge Account Nepal? In the MCC, energy, obviously, is a high-priority area and so is transportation. Where we are with the projects themselves is we have let out the contracts for the sub-stations, for the 18-kilometre cross-border transmission line, and we have reissued the tender for the 297-kilometre broader transmission line package that had to be revised due to some cost changes over the time it took to implement that piece of the package.But we’re pretty positive about getting that back on track by the end of the year and putting the project firmly on the right footing for a five-year completion timeline. But there have also been hurdles, right? Do you still expect the transmission lines and road projects to be completed in five years?I expect there to be more hurdles. The biggest challenge was when the bids came back for the 297-kilometre transmission line. We had a number of delays there from Covid to worldwide inflation, to supply chain shifts that I don’t think people had foreseen completely. I’m not surprised. But the MCC has had a lot of experience around the world with these projects.It builds into this assumption that there will be challenges, there will be situations that need to be rethought and overcome. The real trick is making sure we move forward in a way that’s smart and focused on keeping things on time and on track. We're fortunate in the case of Nepal because we have a partner that has so heavily invested its own resources into the project.We have our $500 million grant and Nepal is putting in almost $200 million. It’s been made a national pride project. Look, other things will inevitably come up. But we believe that we have a good team that’s ready to tackle those types of challenges and press forward.At the end of the day, this can serve as a really positive model for how development assistance and how large-scale infrastructure projects can be implemented in a partnership that is largely the result of an internal domestic process. Don’t forget, Nepal requested the MCC project. The government of Nepal, through a consultative process, developed the idea, designed the project, and is now its lead implementer.We’re a financier and a partner but it is very much a Nepal-owned effort. Talking about challenges, there are many local governments and we have to deal with them every 10 to 15 kilometres in the project areas. Different communities have different concerns and priorities. This can add to some difficulty.What do you think will happen to the project if it cannot meet the five-year deadline?The fate of the project is to be completed in its entirety in five years. I can't speak to whether there’s going to be a particular challenge to delay it by six months or seven months or something like that. Right now, in our planning and projection, we hope that we can move it forward within the timeline.If it needs to go beyond that, we’ll work closely with our partner and figure it out. I’m confident that the $500 million that the US government is providing will be spent within the five years and it will lay a firm foundation for the completion of the project.But coming back to your scenario, indeed, you have different communities. A lot of people are affected by this. Now, on the one hand, that's why we encourage and insist on a consultative process, on everything being as transparent as possible so people know exactly what’s going to happen, that they know what the money is being spent on, what the effects will be in terms of how many trees will have to be cut down or what roads will be built where. That’s very important to us: no surprises for the communities that are out there.I think that we will rely on a lot of that effort to help us propel the project forward if things do get challenging on other fronts as well.Like you said, the project does need to be completed by a deadline of five years. Just in case it doesn’t, what happens?Look, it is an ambitious undertaking. There’s no question about it, right? And the Millennium Challenge Corporation is committed to making it happen within that five-year period. The MCA Nepal is committed to making it happen within that five-year period. But they’re also working closely together to make sure that it’s being done in a proper way, in a transparent way, and I’m confident that we will be able to complete what we need to complete. I’m also sure there’s a firm commitment from the government that if there’s a little piece left over here or there, to make sure it goes forward.I don’t worry about the ultimate completion of the project. I’m more focused on how we get it going as quickly as possible, because just the implementation of the project itself should employ close to 10,000 Nepalis, right? I really want communities to start to see the benefit of the project as soon as possible, because that’s where the transformative nature of it comes into play. Part of it is building it. Part of it is implementing it. Part of it is learning from that process. But then having this infrastructure in place, that’s what really changes the dynamic in Nepal and in the economic well-being of the country.Some fear that a failure to complete the project on time could even create rifts in our bilateral ties.I don’t think they should be fearful. We are partners in this, and if there’s any issue, if we're going to work through it together. What we should be doing is focusing entirely on implementing the project to its fullest potential as quickly as possible.Let’s move to geopolitics. What we see in the region is seemingly an exclusivist India-China geopolitical competition. Indians appear reluctant to work with the regimes that work closely with China. It's almost like they are saying, it's either the Chinese or us. How do you see this geopolitical dynamics playing out in Nepal? And where do the Americans fit in this picture?Yeah, it’s a good question in terms of the dynamic that’s in play today and where things are headed. We have of course been watching the India-China relationship and its development over the past few years with some degree of concern. Obviously, there was conflict there some years ago, and I think they’ve been trying to manage that since.And there’s no question that other countries in the region feel that very powerfully. From our standpoint, what we would like to see is the countries of the region—and particularly Nepal because that’s where I’m accredited and that’s where I have some level of knowledge—exercise their sovereignty and to have the space that they need to make decisions about they own future on behalf of their people in a positive way.We don’t believe countries should be asked to choose. We fully expect that Nepal is going to have good relations with India and China. They’re two neighbours. They’re large countries. They’re important countries in the region. It’s critically important for Nepal that it works with and benefits from both India and China.At the same time, we see no reason that should have any effect on our relationship with Nepal, and no reason Nepal should not be fully able to take full advantage of what the US has to offer. We will continue to watch and continue to work closely with Nepal as a partner and to encourage it to exercise its sovereignty and its decision-making in a way that benefits the Nepali people. The US-China relations are also very dicey at the moment. Surely this has some effect on how the US perceives the Chinese role around the world, including in Nepal.We had a recent high-level visit by our National Security Advisor [to China]. We’ve had recent visits by the Secretary of State, the Secretary of Commerce, the Secretary of Treasury. I think there’s a real effort to try to manage what we all acknowledge is as a competition that’s underway, in a way that’s positive and can maybe move us more towards some type of cooperative element.That channel should continue to be pursued by the US and China, but it’s not reflective of our relationship with Nepal, or our relationship with India. This is about what we can do together [with Nepal]. I’m not going to comment on what other countries may be saying about us, how they may be trying to influence us.I would commit to us remaining as transparent as possible so Nepalis can make their own decisions about what's happening by our relationship.Recently, the Americans were blamed for ousting Sheikh Hasina from Bangladesh. The US is also often accused of meddling in the domestic affairs of other South Asian states, and in other parts of the world for that matter. How do you respond to this accusation?First off, I think you’ve got to take with a grain of salt anything that’s being said by someone who’s been forced to flee their country. The United States simply does not meddle in the internal politics of other countries. We work very hard to be as transparent as we possibly can about our relationships, about what we’re doing, about what we intend.That’s not to say that if we disagree vehemently with a country about a certain policy or a certain issue, we won’t raise it. But this idea that the US would find some benefit in enacting a change in government like that, it simply isn’t part of our repertoire of diplomacy. What we rather look to do is build the strongest relationships that we can.We love to do that primarily through people-to-people relationships and sponsoring as much development opportunity as we possibly can with our partner countries. So, I put no stock in these types of rumours and statements.There is also this sentiment that the Americans and the Indians are increasingly working together on strategic issues, and the same is seen even in South Asia.Certainly, there’s been a huge growth in the strategic partnership between the US and India. I think we want to see that continue to move forward in a positive way. At the same time, there have been disagreements between the US and India on various fronts, just as we have disagreements with many of our partners. And we try to deal with those in a proactive, professional and productive way.But, again, we see our relationship with each individual country through a bilateral lens. So if there are ways that the US and India working together can be beneficial, and another country agrees to such a cooperation, fine. But when it comes to Nepal, we’re going to base our relationship and our efforts first and foremost on our bilateral discussions and our bilateral relationship.Even as we speak, the US and Nepali armies are undertaking joint training in Nepal. How would you characterise the relations between the two armies?Yeah, the PAC ANGEL exercise is going on, focused on disaster relief, humanitarian assistance. The relationship between the two militaries has been strong, it remains strong, and I think it will continue to be strong primarily because we focus it on the areas Nepal wants to focus on—which is building a Nepal army that is capable of responding to disasters, providing humanitarian assistance, and then serving as part of the global peacekeeping network through the United Nations as the largest contributor force of peacekeepers. It’s in our interest to see Nepal continue to professionalise and develop its capacity on those fronts. That’s where our focus is, and that’s where we will continue to make efforts.There has also been a lot of debate in Nepal on the Indo-Pacific Strategy (IPS) and its applicability to South Asia. What is the current state of its application?The Indo-Pacific Strategy is a broad, big strategy by the United States government about how it looks at the entire region. And so it’s about how we create an open, independent, sovereign Indo-Pacific region for the benefit of all the people in the region.What we will continue to do is employ it to build relationships we have with each of the countries in the region. How can we continue to support democratic development? How can we continue to support economic development? Let’s not forget a huge portion, maybe 60 percent of the world’s commerce transits the Indo-Pacific corridor in some way, shape, or form every year.It’s in everyone’s interest for that to remain open and free. And for the countries of the region to be able to act in a sovereign way in their own interests.There is also a sizable section of Nepalis who believe that the IPS was brought with the intent of countering China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), and that Nepal is struggling to find a balance between the two. What is your reading?The USAID, the MCC, the Development Finance Corporation, all of our development programmes have a singular purpose, which is to work with our bilateral partners to grow their economies, to make them more able to meet the needs of their people. That’s the goal. That's how they were designed. And that’s how we will continue to treat them.The BRI is China's initiative. It’s pushing that forward. It’s up to each country to decide how it wants to engage with others. We believe the model of, say, a USAID or an MCC is proving itself to be beneficial to countries, as they are grant-based and economic growth oriented. We’ll continue to push them because we think the data and historical experience we’ve had support them.I think it’s incumbent on us to try to help all of our partners relate to us as equals in any realm that we’re working together. That’s critically important and something we have to acknowledge and something we have to make sure that they’re able to acknowledge.It's about building trust, about showing that our intent is correct, that we have the best interest of our partners in mind, and that we’re applying the same and transparent standards universally.For example, on the MCC, we’ve published everything on the internet. If anybody in Nepal has a question about any aspect of the project, they can go to the website, they can read about the project, they can see the blueprints, they can know exactly what it’s going to involve. That's how I think we build relationships.I think if I came to Nepal and said, hey, I want to do X project because I want to counter this country, I don’t think I would get very good reception. We just don’t look at the world that way. It’s not a healthy approach in the long run.But a bilateral focus that seeks to empower the people of a country—that’s where I think we have the best chance of moving forward. Nepal’s Parliament has finally passed an amendment to the transitional justice law. How does the US see this development? How do you see the transitional justice process progressing?I think this is a really important step in the process. I would say that we remain positive about the way it's going and we are looking to see how we can help. You noted, I’m sure, that we joined a number of other partner countries in issuing a statement of support after the Parliament passed it.We all know bringing a conflict of this scale to conclusion is always going to be a challenge. The TJ legislation has passed, which was a tough hurdle, but implementation will also be difficult.We’re looking forward to figuring out how we can be supportive, and how other partners can be supportive. Some of that may be through bilateral means. Some of it may be through multilateral means.But what I remain encouraged about, in particular, is, we’ve always said this needs to be a Nepali-run process. It has been. That it needs to be victim-centric. I believe that it is. And so we need to make sure the consultative piece of this remains alive as you move to implementation, so that the victims groups, so that the child soldier groups, so that other entities that have been involved continue to have a voice and continue to work together to figure out how to resolve this, to make reparations work, to bring justice in those cases. And so, we are positive.Thousands of Nepali youths are leaving the country every single day in search of better jobs. In this light, do you see the prospect of greater American FDI helping Nepal build a more robust economy that can create enough good jobs?I do. At the beginning of the interview, I talked about some sectors of the economy that are quite exciting right now. I think you’re seeing a lot of interest from the US in the IT sector, the tourism sector, in the health sector, and in the energy sector as it continues to develop.We’re very keen to look for ways to bring more US investment here, whether it’s through equity sort of vehicles, or direct bilateral investments. I think that can also be positive. I think Nepal did a good job in setting up that April Investment Summit. That sent a really positive signal. You’ll recall that we had a representative from the US Chamber of Commerce, Atul Keshap, come out for that. We’ve had a great run of senior US visitors out here over the last year and a half.I think the key right now is for Nepal, through its private sector, through its government, to figure out how to make the environment for investment in Nepal as attractive as it can possibly be. In this interview, we’ve talked about the idea of competition between countries. One place where I will absolutely acknowledge there’s competition is in trying to attract investment.And so Nepal needs to figure out how to make itself as attractive as possible, and how to make it as easy as possible to do business. That helps not only investments that come from other countries, but makes it easier for Nepalis to start businesses, right? It makes it easier for Nepalis to operate and do what they want. And so, in addition to welcoming, say, US companies or British companies or Canadian companies, we would also love to see Nepalis who have gone abroad come back and start to help in building the economy here.We’ve seen how capable and how dynamic they are in building other people’s economies. Let’s do the same here at home.I mentioned that the trade and investment framework talks that we have with Nepal are in their seventh round. I look forward to, in the rest of my tenure here, to continue to build the momentum that will allow investment to take shape and the economy here to thrive. \nHere’s what Prime Minister KP Oli told the parliament on Monday, saying he was giving the address for a “special” reason: “Nepal wants to maintain neighbourly relations as a good neighbour, not a petty, scheming neighbour…Nepal wants a similar behaviour on the part of its neighbours.”He pursued this line of argument, implying that India is wishing ill on Nepal, imposing on Nepal’s sovereignty and interfering in its independent status and policy. He then told the parliament that he would present the issue at the United Nations General Assembly.It basically amounts to saying he will complain to the UN about India’s behaviour. What a petty idea.Given his inherent character trait, PM Oli will find it difficult to develop trusted relations with India in the short term. His only option is to be diplomatic, predictable and consistent. So far, he’s not been able to do that. It does not bode well for Nepal’s foreign policy, which is the most important means of pursuing Nepal’s current priorities, including jobs, growth and climate change.Calculated relations Oli’s statement in the parliament indicates at least three things. First, his expectations from India have not been fulfilled. Second, his communications with the country have broken down. And third, he thinks India may be working to undermine his political authority.Let’s look at his expectations from the southern neighbour. Oli wants to hold high-level talks with PM Modi of India and build trusted relations.In the past two weeks, media reports and opinion pieces have discussed whether Oli would be invited to India or not. It has almost become customary in Nepal for a new prime minister to visit India first before embarking on other high-level visits. Such a custom indicates the value politicians accord to India, especially if they want their government to be stable.The second indication is that Oli is finding it difficult to communicate with people who matter in India. When you begin to communicate your feelings about India through the media, it indicates that your direct communications have either broken down or are ineffective.Behind Oli’s statement is an obvious intention to play the blame game or rally the public. India may be at fault for many things, but blaming India does not absolve him of inconsistencies on his part or the sheer inability to conduct diplomacy in a dignified manner.The third indication is even more significant. Oli has consistently promoted anti-Indian nationalism, and India finds it difficult to trust him. But would that alone be enough to undermine his government?Throughout history, India has had a significant influence on Nepal’s political process and decision-making. Through its influence on individuals who’ve received gifts, benefits, and resources, some at the highest levels, India holds significant leverage over political decision-making and, by extension, over policies and processes.An old playbookIndia’s calculated relations with the Nepali state came to the fore in August this year when Foreign Minister Arzu Rana Deuba visited India. New Delhi turned her visit into a high-profile affair even though she was unprepared to represent Nepal’s interests. Her visit, rather than building political trust, ended up creating more mistrust between Oli and New Delhi as well as between the Foreign Ministry and the Prime Minister’s Office.Although it is a matter of speculation, there are strong grounds to argue that such a courtesy would not have been extended to someone from the CPN (UML). It generates the question, at least in the public’s mind, whether India accorded special treatment to FM Rana as a “special” individual who happened to be the foreign minister and not as a representative of Nepal.Whether real or not, the perception that India is unhappy with Oli has fuelled the notion that the current government coalition is unstable.Throughout Nepal’s modern history, whenever top leaders are forced out, they tend to seek India’s support to regain power. I have heard firsthand from top political leaders that India used to put a pre-condition: First, demonstrate that you have people's support, then we will use our leverage to help you. Thus, the political leaders would launch a political campaign and hold mass meetings throughout the country. If the broader political environment favoured a political change, then India made the additional push.Now, as Pushpa Kamal Dahal tours the country, blaming a corrupt network of power brokers, we are reminded of this old playbook. During mass meetings, an embittered Dahal frequently alleges that “middlemen, brokers, and big cronies have gotten together, and with the strength of so-called numbers, have tried to strangle truth, justice…and good governance.” He also tells the public that his government was ousted because the investigations on corruption were leading to Budhanilkantha (Deuba’s residence) and Balkot (Oli’s residence).Oli’s inherent anti-Indian streakFor Oli, an inherent anti-Indian streak in his psychological make-up and an affinity with the Communist Party of China makes rapprochement with India difficult.In the last 10 years, Oli has made countless petty statements intended to rile and irritate India. He has also accorded China greater space in Nepal.In his book, former deputy PM Kamal Thapa expresses distaste at the way Oli made an unscheduled visit to China Gezhouba Group Corporation and disappeared for one and a half hours for a private meeting with Chinese Communist Party officials during his visit to China in 2016.Another issue is the Eminent Persons’ Group report, which Oli raised during the launch of Thapa’s book. “It would be good to receive the report,” he said during the programme. He made more anti-Indian remarks at another similar event.At present, any talk of the EPG report is viewed as an irritant by India, because it has consistently sent a clear diplomatic message that the report is dead. The unwillingness of a section of the Nepali populace to accept the message, including the CPN-UML, has not gone well in India.In a recent discussion programme, a former ambassador of India to Nepal indicated that the EPG report had become a new irritant in Nepal-India relations. He said that instead of insisting on the acceptance of the report, Nepal could pursue the individual issues identified. Trends in the last two decades indicate that instead of really trying to address the outstanding issues in Nepal-India relations, Nepali leaders are just interested in politicising them and gaining personal mileage.Nepal’s relationship with India has become more and more of a paradox. Nepal’s dominant ethno-nationalism is anti-Indian. Indeed, Nepal has many unresolved issues with India, but it’s economic development hinges on closer connectivity with India, which in turn hinges on trusted political relationships and ability to untangle complex issues.Snubbed by India, Oli is now headed to the US, where he could still get to meet a lukewarm Modi. He hopes to gain stature and make an impression at several forums including the UNGA, where he is scheduled to deliver speeches. We can only wish our PM well. \n\nOn September 1, on the final day of the Nepali Congress Central Working Committee meeting, General Secretary Bishwa Prakash Sharma explicitly urged Sher Bahadur Deuba, the party president, to give up his aspirations to be the prime minister yet again.As per the seven-point agreement between the Congress and the CPN-UML on July 1, UML Chairman KP Sharma Oli, the incumbent prime minister, will lead the government for the first two years. Then Congress chief Deuba will lead the government until the elections in November-December 2027. Sharma urged Deuba to leave the prime minister’s post for another senior Congress leader. Deuba reportedly rejected the proposal outright.“I will not give up the position just because someone so desires,” Deuba reportedly said in response.Sharma, one of the two general secretaries of the country’s oldest political party, had proposed an exit policy in his contemporary political proposal tabled at the Mahasamiti meeting in February for the leaders holding state positions such as president, prime minister, ministers.Besides Sharma's proposal, the Mahasamiti also endorsed the papers submitted by Vice-president Purna Bahadur Khadka and General Secretary Gagan Thapa. However, it also gave room for the central committee to modify the proposal. When the central committee approved Khadka’s policy proposal and Thapa’s organisational proposal with minor changes, Sharma’s paper was pushed back to be considered while amending the national constitution.Sharma proposed one term for the [country’s] President, two terms for the prime minister, three terms for ministers, and four terms for lawmakers. Sharma’s proposal on term limits on persons serving as the country’s president or the prime minister is a national rather than the party’s issue, so it has been deferred, according to party leaders. Most of the Congress central leaders who spoke at the meeting, which lasted almost a month with gaps in between, claimed that fixing a time limit for the leadership was contrary to the democratic principle that the party champions.UML chief whip Mahesh Bartaula also says that since politics is a voluntary job, the politicians should be able to contribute to the society for as long as they want. “Nonetheless, the exit policy proposal is thought-provoking,” Bartaula told the Post. As a new generation of leaders is yet to be fully developed, the public still trusts the older crop of leaders, he argues. “Those vying for top positions are yet to gain the public’s credibility.”For Krishna Pokharel, a professor of political science, it would be unnatural to amend the constitution to address Sharma’s demand. “In countries where people directly elect their prime minister, amending the constitution to limit the executive head’s term could be reasonable” Pokharel told the Post. “However, in a country like Nepal where the parties choose the prime minister, exit policy should rather be mentioned in the party’s statute.” Had Nepali leaders internalised the spirit of the parliamentary system, their entry and exit points need not have been discussed. “The parliamentary system in Nepal has been vulgarised,” Pokharel added. According to political experts, despite the Congress leaders criticising the exit policy at the central committee, the proposal’s public appeal is growing. They see no alternative to its implementation, sooner or later. One reason for growing public disenchantment with political parties is that the same old faces have continued in leadership positions for a long time. If there were a term limit for a leader in a governmental or party position, people’s dissatisfaction would somehow be addressed.Experts say the recent political upheaval in Bangladesh and the political crisis of Sri Lanka two years ago were due to the continuous rule by a single person or a single family.One reason some democracies struggle is their political leaders’ unlimited hunger for power, Uddab Pyakurel, a political analyst, told the Post. “In Nordic countries, there is no need to set term limits for leaders as there is already a strong democratic culture there.” Despite having leaders like Donald Trump, American democracy still works, partly because of the term limits, Pyakurel reasoned. “If Nepal is to strengthen its democratic system, it must implement the exit policy for political leaders,” he said. Some political experts see problems even after introducing a term limit.Arguing that limiting the tenure for top positions alone is not enough to put curbs on autocratic tendencies, Khagendra Prasai, another political analyst, said: “The major issue is developing political mannerism and culture.”Calls for the top party leadership making way for a new generation are growing not just in the Congress. Even during the CPN (Maoist Centre) standing committee meeting last month, Deputy General Secretary Janardan Sharma questioned Pushpa Kamal Dahal’s uninterrupted leadership for nearly 35 years. Sharma even urged Dahal to resign the position. Experts say leaders with limited terms realise they must get a lot done within the given time at the top. There is no slow cooldown period. The current set of top party leaders—Deuba, Oli and Dahal in particular—have been in power for two or three decades, repeatedly assuming the country’s top executive position. Article 216 (7) of the Constitution of Nepal says a person elected mayor for two terms will not be eligible to be a candidate in future municipal elections. Article 215 (7) has a similar provision for chairpersons of rural municipalities.The constitution also has a two-term limit for President.While all other top governing posts come with fixed terms, there are limits on how many times the prime minister, chief ministers, ministers, and lawmakers can serve. This allows politicians to occupy office for as long as they choose, preventing the leadership handover to the next generation. In the view of Mighendra Bahadur Karki, executive director of the Centre for Nepal and Asia Studies (CNAS) at Tribhuvan University: “Leaders who know that their peers, even junior colleagues, may someday be their supervisors may be more thoughtful of their behaviour. Poor behaviour and status anxiety might be reduced, increasing the room for collaboration.” If senior leaders know that they need to bow out of the government or the party after a particular time, they are more likely to train and promote junior leaders to take their place, Karki told the Post. “This in turn will cultivate a healthy political culture.”But he warned that the question of term limit is not straightforward. “The exit policy, if it is to be implemented, should be system-centric rather than targeting particular leaders.” \nRae was the envoy to Kathmandu during the promulgation of the 2015 constitution and the subsequent blockade. In this conversation, Rae talks about the evolution of Nepal-India ties since the blockade, regional geopolitics, what the two countries get wrong about each other, how New Delhi views Nepali communist parties and the governments they lead, and the change (if any) in India’s neighbourhood policy since the start of Narendra Modi’s third term in office. \nKunwar has been the MD for just under three years. Before coming back to her homeland to join Daraz Nepal, she worked at different American companies, including Amazon, the world’s biggest e-commerce platform. In this conversation, Kunwar talks about the opportunities and challenges of running an e-commerce enterprise in Nepal, as well as the country’s overall business environment.  \nWhen the Ranjitkar group was established, they discovered this forgotten dance and devoted two years to researching it.Now, they are reintroducing it during Indra Jatra by training the new generation in this traditional art form. \nHe is known for his nationalist legacy, marked by the amendment of Nepal's map to include territories like Kalapani, Lipulekh, and Limpiyadhura, and his strong stance against India, especially during and after the 2015 Nepal blockade.But how did he rise to become the country's powerful man? \nPrakriti Bhattarai Basnet is a Master of Public Policy (MPP) candidate at the University of Oxford interested in the Digital Transformation of Governments, Cybersecurity, and Statecraft. She is a research assistant at the Blavatnik School of Government (one of the University of Oxford’s newest departments), which focuses on strengthening democracy by addressing threats to women in politics. Basnet is also a teaching fellow at the Harvard Kennedy School’s executive education program LSA-Public Narrative: Leadership, Storytelling, and Acton. In this conversation with the Post’s Timila Maharjan, Basnet discusses books that have helped her grow personally and professionally.How did you get into reading?My mother used to offer facials for women, going from house to house. At one of her clients' homes, she noticed that the daughter, who was around my age and attended St Mary's School, was always studying thick books. After discovering that these books were helpful for children's development, my mother started borrowing them for me. This sparked my love for books, but ‘Chicken Soup for the Soul’ ignited my passion for reading. Although access to those books was limited, I was captivated by the children's magazine ‘Muna’ and eagerly read every letter in ‘Kopila’.What kind of genre do you usually prefer? Choosing between genres is like choosing between my father and mother—I simply can’t. I enjoy reading all genres because each one stimulates the mind and soul in its unique way. Five years ago, I would have said non-fiction was my favourite, but now I believe reading should primarily be about enjoyment. In fiction, I have a particular fondness for dystopian novels. Recently, I’ve also been exploring Russian literature. This year, I read three of Dostoevsky’s works, and they have challenged my views on morality. I’ve hesitated to pick up another one because of how much they've shaken my beliefs. My growing interest in dystopian novels and Dostoevsky stems from how they help me reflect on my moral compass and question my beliefs.How has reading contributed to your personal and professional development?Every book I’ve read has left an imprint on me—some subtle, like a light trace on the sand, and others more significant, like a lasting scar—every opinion I hold or decision has been shaped by one book or another. On a personal level, reading has made me more empathetic and patient. Professionally, it has enriched my vocabulary and offered new perspectives for tackling challenges.Where do you prefer to read books, and why?I can’t read books anywhere else but at home. I don’t know where my home is because I have been moving around, but I prefer to read alone.Which book left an impression on you? And how has it influenced you?‘The Brothers Karamazov’ by Dostoevsky has affected me. I found reflections of myself in Alyosha, Ivan, and Dmitri—some aspects I utterly related to, while others were parts of myself I was hesitant to face. The struggle between good and evil, intertwined with themes of justice and forgiveness, made me confront my imperfections. It has even changed how I listen to others. The book has made me more like Alyosha, constantly seeking to understand what lies beneath the surface.Apart from reading, do you also enjoy writing?I experience imposter syndrome when it comes to writing. I create pieces but never share them. Although I want to pursue writing, I often feel that my work isn’t genuine and feels hypocritical. I need to learn to be honest about my emotions before writing.During lockdown, you went live on Instagram and read books to your followers. Why did you do that?If I’m being honest, it started because I was struggling with my sleep schedule. I saw many friends going through the same thing and thought, ‘Let's have a little story-time thing on Instagram before going to bed.’ We also wanted to raise awareness about some fantastic Nepali literature.Have your reading habits evolved since starting your studies at Oxford? Has it changed your approach to books?I haven’t had much time to read besides academic books and papers. Since arriving here and spending time with my friends, I’ve noticed that my ability to focus for long periods has improved significantly. It’s amusing how I expected to gravitate more towards non-fiction after coming here, but the people I’ve met have encouraged me to return to fiction. Their ability to quote Shakespeare, Austen, and Tolstoy during intense policy debates has inspired me.Have you encountered books that have changed your perspective on governance or public policy?Three books that I consumed and that transformed my perspective on policies are ‘Nudge: Improving Decisions about Health, Wealth, and Happiness’ by Richard H Thaler and Cass R Sunstein, ‘The Tragedy of Great Power Politics’ by John Mearsheimer, and ‘Governing the Commons: The Evolution of Institutions for Collective Action’ by Elinor Ostrom. I highly recommend ‘Nudge’ to everyone, as it uses behavioural economics to influence public policy, promoting small policy changes that can lead to significant improvements.Is there a book that everyone in public policy or leadership should read?Deborah Stone's ‘Policy Paradox: The Art of Political Decision Making’ highlights that policymaking is far more complex and nuanced than many realise. The book explains that policy decisions are not solely based on rationality but are influenced by various values that policymakers have consciously and unconsciously adopted.Are there any authors whose work resonates with your mission and values?I appreciate James C Scott’s work in ‘Seeing Like a State’. The book’s insights into large-scale project failures highlight the significance of local knowledge. I connect with this idea because urbanisation has often diminished the unique character of cities, and Scott’s book deepened my understanding of what it means to “see like a state.” Regarding Niccolò Machiavelli, people tend to be divided into two camps: those who admire him and those who think he could have benefited from therapy. Regardless, ‘The Prince’ offers valuable lessons in pragmatic governance.Which book are you currently reading? And why?I just submitted my final report, so I am reading something light. It’s called ‘Yellowface’ by RF Kuang. It’s straightforward but eccentric.Prakriti Bhattarai Basnet's five book recommendationsNudgeAuthor: Richard H Thaler and Cass R SunsteinPublisher: Yale University PressYear: 2008This book outlines how small nudges in policymaking can lead to subtle shifts that enable better decision-making.Crime and Punishment Author: Fyodor DostoevskyPublisher: The Russian MessengerYear: 1866Dostoevsky’s novel encourages self-reflection on morality, guilt, and redemption while exploring the internal conflicts of the human heart.Chirharan Author: Neelam Karki NiharikaPublisher: Sangri~la BooksYear: 2016It provides a glimpse into the lives of mythical characters through a feminist lens, highlighting their experiences and struggles.Deep Work Author: Cal NewportPublisher: Grand Central PublishingYear: 2016Young people struggling with popcorn brain syndrome should read this book to recognise the impact of reduced attention spans.QuietAuthor: Susan CainPublisher: CrownYear: 2012Cain’s book is for extroverts who secretly long for introversion, offering validation for those who balance both identities. \nThe Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP), the fourth largest in Parliament, is fiercely resisting what it claims are government moves to arrest its chair, Rabi Lamichhane, over allegations of his involvement in cooperatives fraud. But all the other national parties seem to be in favour of his prosecution. Among the seven national parties in Parliament, there is a growing consensus for holding Lamichhane accountable. A party needs to win at least one FPTP seat and get three percent proportional representation votes to get national party status.Ruling coalition partners such as the Nepali Congress, the CPN-UML, Ashok Rai’s Janata Samajbadi Party, and the Janamat Party believe that RSP chair Lamichhane should face the law. Additionally, the CPN (Maoist Centre), the main opposition in Parliament, along with the Rastriya Prajantra Party and Janata Samajbadi Party-Nepal (JSP-Nepal), both of which are outside the coalition, also support the parliamentary probe’s findings and advocate action against Lamichhane. The CPN (Unified Socialist), which is not a national party but has 10 seats in the lower house, has also joined the ranks of parties that want Lamichhane prosecuted. “Our party believes that, as a matter of principle, no innocent should be punished, and no guilty evade the law,” says the Maoist Centre Secretary Devendra Paudel.On the probe panel’s findings, Paudel said, “Evidence suggests that Lamichhane misused cooperative funds,” Paudel told the Post. “He should be held accountable for his actions as per the law.” A source close to Home Minister Ramesh Lekhak while talking to the Post said, “If everything goes as planned, the police will arrest Lamichhane soon.”However, during a recent interview with Kantipur Television’s Fireside program, Pushpa Kamal Dahal, the chairman of the Maoist Centre, was noncommittal on whether Lamichhane should be prosecuted for misusing cooperative funds.But party secretary Paudel said his party would take a stand against Lamichhane’s misuse of cooperative funds.Unified Socialist spokesperson Jagannath Khatiwada says that the probe panel’s recommendations should be implemented. “Although our party has yet to take an official position on it, I can say that our leaders are discussing the parliamentary probe report and there is a general consensus that the report’s recommendations should be implemented.”“The report suggests that the government should further investigate and prosecute four key people [Rabi Lamichhane, GB Rai, Chhabi Joshi, and Kumar Ramtel] involved in the misuse of multiple cooperative funds, and our party supports the report,” Khatiwada told the Post. “Those proven guilty should be booked under the prevailing laws.” While Rai is on the run, Ramtel is in judicial custody of Kaski police. After arresting Joshi, Police are now waiting for the government’s green light to arrest Lamichhane, who has twice served as deputy prime minister and home minister.The Janata Samajbadi Party-Nepal (JSP-Nepal), led by Upendra Yadav, also views Lamichhane as culpable in the misuse of the cooperative funds and disputes the RSP’s claim that he got a clean chit from the parliamentary special probe. “Our party does not want to disrespect any political leaders as such, but that does not mean a guilty individual should escape legal repercussions,” Manish Kumar Suman, the party central spokesperson, told the Post. “The report clearly indicates Lamichhane’s involvement in misusing cooperative funds, so there is no question of him getting a clear chit, unlike what the RSP leaders claim.” Rastriya Prajatantra Party Vice President Dhruba Bahadur Pradhan says the parliamentary probe panel, which investigated crisis-ridden cooperatives, has done its job and submitted a report and now it is the government’s responsibility to act on the recommendations.“As for our party’s position, Lamichhane should be prosecuted under the prevailing laws, as per the special committee’s report,” Pradhan told the Post. Lamichhane is accused of siphoning funds from multiple cooperatives to run the Gorkha Media Network, which operated the Galaxy 4k Television channel. The channel shut down last year. Chairman GB (Gitendra Babu) Rai and managing director Lamichhane jointly ran the media company before Lamichhane quit it to join politics in June 2022. On September 16, the parliamentary special committee submitted its report to Speaker Ghimire, who forwarded it to the government on the same day. On September 19, the Cabinet owned the report and ordered responsible ministries to act based on its findings. The probe panel’s report does not directly implicate Lamichhane in rerouting cooperative funds into the media, but it does label him guilty of using cooperative funds for Gorkha Media Network. The panel has recommended that the government prosecute Lamichhane; his business partner Rai; one of the founders of Gorkha Media Company, Chhabi Joshi; and board member Kumar Ramtel. As the panel report could not establish a direct link between Lamichhane and the rerouting of cooperative funds, RSP leaders interpret it as a ‘clean chit’ for their party chief. But leaders from other parties reject this claim.“The way RSP leaders are trying to interpret the probe panel’s report is distortion,” Pradhan said.Based on the report, the crime division of Nepal Police arrested Joshi, former deputy inspector general of Nepal Police and one of the founders of Gorkha Media Network, on the orders of Home Minister Ramesh Lekhak on Sunday. Following this, RSP chair Lamichhane organised a gathering of party sympathisers at his office to condemn the government amid rumours of his impending arrest. While addressing supporters at the RSP headquarters in Balaju, Kathmandu on Sunday evening, he urged them to be prepared to defend their new political force, claiming that a plan was afoot to ‘finish Rabi Lamichhane and the Rastriya Swatantra Party.’The erstwhile main opposition party, Nepali Congress, had continuously disrupted the parliamentary proceedings for over two months demanding a probe into the cooperatives scam, especially its connections to the Gorkha Media Network. In response, the immediate past government led by Maoist Centre chair Dahal had formed the parliamentary special probe panel.  \nRepresentatives at the first national conference of the Rastriya Swatantra Party saw factionalism within the party.Some of the representatives who arrived in Kathmandu three days ago for the two-day gathering starting on Tuesday said that growing factionalism is not healthy for the new political outfit promising to challenge traditional forces like the Nepali Congress and the CPN-UML.“We were told that factionalism existed in our party in various forms, but we denied such claims. However, during our three days in Kathmandu, we witnessed it,” a group of party members told the Post. It seems that President Rabi Lamichhane and Vice-president Swarnim Wagle are not in the same boat on how the party should function, they added.RSP acting spokesperson Manish Jha explains that it is the lack of synchronisation—rather than differences—between the leaders. “People from various schools of thought came together to form the RSP. It is true that we lack synchronisation, but it would be wrong to portray it as differences.”Another leader of the party said on condition of anonymity that the party has two schools of thought—one based on democratic principles and the other opposed to it.RSP acting general secretary Kabindra Burlakoti claims that the party is united.In conversations with the Post, representatives from Kathmandu Valley, Pokhara and Chitwan sounded more optimistic with the central leadership while those from remote areas were confused over their take on the party’s central leadership.The representatives from Madhesh were mild in their opinion about the leadership.Moreover, representatives were also not very positive about the way the central leadership is investing their energy to claim that Lamichhane had got a clean chit from the parliamentary special committee formed to investigate crisis-ridden cooperatives.The probe panel, which submitted its report to the House of Representatives, has recommended the government prosecute Lamichhane, along with his former business partner GB (Gitendra Babu) Rai, board member of the media Kumar Ramtel and initial founder Chhabi Lal Joshi as per the prevailing laws. The inquiry committee, however, has said it couldn’t establish Lamichhane’s role in rerouting the cooperatives fund to Gorkha Media Network.“It would have been better had the central leadership waited to see how the government would take action,” the group of representatives from western Nepal told the Post. “In case Lamichhane is booked under the law, it could be counterproductive for the party in the long run.”The political campaign started by the RSP won’t get stalled even without Lamichhane, the representatives said, expressing their confidence in the party’s longevity.Lamichhane also presented a political report incorporating proposed statutory changes, the party’s commitments to voters, policy agenda presented by Swarnim Wagle at the Jaleshwar meeting and the conclusion drawn from the closed session of the national conference.Lamichhane’s report states that the policy paper presented in Jaleshwar defined ‘constitutional socialism’ as the party’s political ideology. Lamichhane also accuses the ruling Nepali Congress and CPN-UML of trying to lead the country to a two-party system by polarising smaller parties. “On the pretext of administrative reform, they are planning to wipe out the existence of small parties,” the report reads. “Potentially, this step can bring together new parties that want to be an alternative political force sooner or later.”Asked about RSP’s possible alliance with other parties, Burlakoti said though they are not in talks with the main opposition CPN (Maoist Centre), they are in regular contact with several independent candidates of last election.Asked if they are in discussion with Kathmandu Metropolitan City Mayor Balendra Shah, who won the 2022 local election independently, Burlakoti said: “Strategic moves are not to be disclosed.”However, when the national conference concluded after Lamichhane presented his report, representatives arriving from around the country were displeased.“This is not the way a party functions,” a representative told the Post, asking not to be named for fears of reprisal.When leaders put themselves at the centre and cadres in the periphery, the party’s downfall begins, another representative said. Acting General Secretary Burlakoti, however, defended the party leadership. “Our national conference was designed this way,” Burlakoti said. The report presented by the chair will be discussed in the party’s Mahakali-Mechi campaign that will start soon, he added.“At the national conference, we gave 5 percent of the total representatives (1500) time to speak, but those who spoke exceeded that number,” Burlakoti said.The conference, however, passed Lamichhane’s report. On Wednesday, Lamichhane announced the date of the party’s first general convention. It will be held on May 8-10 at a yet-undecided venue.“I would like to inform you that the Central Committee has become the general convention organising committee,” Burlakoti said. Lamichhane also announced the ‘Mahakali-Mechi Campaign’ to interact with the general public.In his report, Lamichhane has proposed a person not affiliated to any party to be elected the country’s president, directly elected executive head, or the prime minister. He also proposes giving the nation’s vice president the responsibility to chair the National Assembly.While the paper bats for a fully proportional electoral system, it says provincial assemblies cannot be accepted in the current shape.However, this does not mean the RSP is against the federal structure gained through the sacrifice of thousands of people, another representative said. “Our party has no strength to amend the constitution and scrap the federal structure. Therefore, for the time being, voices are growing among the party members about accepting the present political structure,” Khemraj Koirala, a conference representative from Kailali told the Post.Party members also suggested downsizing the number of ministers to make the provincial system functional, Koirala said.The report also stands for reducing the number of municipalities to less than 500, from the current 753. \nThe coalition government of the CPN-UML and the Nepali Congress has reiterated its commitment to review the achievements made and weaknesses observed in the course of implementing the constitution in the past nine years.The two ruling parties have pledged to amend the constitution based on a broader understanding made through discussions, dialogues and consultations with political parties, civil society, intelligentsia, constitutional experts and the public.The parties have said such amendments will be made mainly based on the findings of the review and experiences of implementing it. Moreover, the parties said that establishing political stability in the country would be the major objective of the amendment.The two ruling parties made the commitments in the common minimum programme of the government, which was submitted to Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli and Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba on Wednesday evening. The parties had earlier formed a four-member panel to draft the government’s programme based on a seven-point agreement reached between the Congress and the UML in the first week of July. Party general secretary Gagan Thapa and spokesperson Prakash Sharan Mahat from Congress, and party deputy general secretaries Pradeep Gyawali and Bishnu Rimal from the CPN-UML were tasked to prepare the document. They jointly submitted the document to the two party chiefs and made it public.“The achievements of the 2006 movement and the fundamental pillars of this constitution including federal, republic and inclusive governance system will be further institutionalised and strengthened,” the document says.The seven-page document is divided into eight subtitles—safeguarding national interest and independent foreign policy; protection, implementation and amendment of the constitution; good governance and quality service delivery; dynamic economy and development; ensuring social justice and fundamental rights; youth partnership; transitional justice, sustainable peace and social harmony; and miscellaneous.The coalition has pledged to set up a high-powered cooperative regulatory body as per the recommendation of the parliamentary inquiry committee to address the problems seen in the cooperative sector.“Taking action against those involved in misusing funds from cooperatives, the return of depositors’ money will be ensured,” the common minimum programme states.The ruling parties have pledged to punish corrupt people irrespective of the individuals’ power and positions. On the economic front, the coalition has vowed to expedite generation and transmission of hydroelectricity and further intensify the electrification process. \nThe erstwhile Pushpa Kamal Dahal government on April 12 constituted a committee led by Om Prakash Mishra, a former chief justice, to nominate candidates to the Truth and Reconciliation Commission and the Commission of Investigation on Enforced Disappeared Persons. While the government picked four members for the committee, the fifth member is either the chairperson of the National Human Rights Commission or someone nominated by him. Initially, the commission had insisted that revision of the Enforced Disappearance Enquiry, Truth and Reconciliation Commission Act was a precondition for its participation in the committee, but following the Act’s amendment, it agreed to join the Mishra panel. However, three weeks after President Ramchandra Paudel authenticated the bill to amend the Act that the federal parliament endorsed, the constitutional human rights watchdog has yet to recommend its representative. Its officials said they are waiting for a formal request from the Ministry of Law, Justice and Parliamentary Affairs, as they expect a new letter in the changed context.“We have been told the ministry would send a new request letter for our representative, given the new context following the amendment to the Act,” said a commission member. The revised Act states that the recommendation committee has two months to make nominations for the chairpersons and members of the two commissions. It has already been five months since the Mishra-led panel was formed. However, a senior official at the law ministry said he does not think a new process needs to start just because the Act has been amended. “The two month countdown began the day the revised Act was enacted,” said the official. “I also don’t think the ministry told the commission that it would send a new request letter. If such a message was conveyed, it may have come from the political level.” Those involved in forging all-party consensus on the amendment say tensions between the CPN-UML and the CPN (Maoist Centre) have stalled the transitional justice process. Relations between the two parties have not been cordial ever since the formation of the new ruling alliance. The UML has consistently referred to the Maoist insurgency as ‘violence’, while the Maoist Centre has warned that the present KP Sharma Oli government could meet the same fate as Sheikh Hasina Wazed, the immediate past prime minister of Bangladesh.“The tussle between the two parties has directly affected the ongoing process,” one leader involved in the negotiations told the Post. “Oli doesn't seem as interested as he was earlier.”The committee was formed in May amid reservations from conflict-era victims of human rights violations and human rights defenders, who demanded that the Act be amended before selecting office bearers. The government, however, argued that forming the committee was necessary as per the Supreme Court’s March 12 order to the government to select office bearers for the two commissions within a month.The court had asked the government to constitute task forces within the commissions to conduct preliminary investigations into the victims’ complaints until the office bearers were appointed.Following the court’s order, the victims and human rights defenders demanded the government and the parties endorse the legal amendments by the top court’s deadline before starting the selection process. However, the amendment bill couldn’t be endorsed within the deadline, prompting the government to form a committee based on existing law.Following the committee’s formation, the victims and human rights defenders requested the government to halt the selection process until the Act was amended. They also urged the national rights watchdog to hold off on sending its representative.The two commissions have been defunct since July 2022, when the government decided to extend their terms without retaining their chairmen and members. The government claimed the bill to amend the transitional justice law would be endorsed by October 2022, and the appointments made based on the revised Act.But it took over two years for the federal parliament to endorse the bill. The victims and human rights defenders are closely watching who will be appointed to the commissions.The Truth Commission has received 63,718 complaints, while the commission on disappearances is sitting on around 2,400 cases. The new teams will have four years to accomplish their tasks, though there are provisions for their extension. The commissions that were formed in 2015 have done nothing other than collect complaints and conduct preliminary investigations on some of them.  \nTicket bookings for public transport during the Dashain festival will open this Saturday. Following discussions with stakeholders, the Department of Transport Management announced that tickets will be available online and at counters to manage the expected surge of nearly two million travellers leaving the Kathmandu Valley for the festivities.According to the department’s Director General, Rajiv Pokharel, transport operators will facilitate online bookings. “We have instructed operators to arrange online bookings wherever possible,” he said. “For counter bookings, passengers must obtain tickets only from official staff wearing uniforms and identification badges.”Around two million people are estimated to leave the Kathmandu Valley during Dashain. The department has introduced 20-point directives to ensure safe and hassle-free travel. Key measures include mandatory checks for alcohol consumption by drivers at major entry and exit points and the requirement for two drivers on long-distance routes. Additionally, those under 18 cannot work as assistant drivers.To assist travellers during Dashain, Tihar, and Chhath festivals, citizen help desks will be established at major locations such as Nagdhunga, Kalanki, Swayambhu, Halchowk, Machhapokhari, Gongabu Bus Park, Chabahil, Tilganga, Koteshwar, Jagati, Satdobato, Balkhu, Dakshinkali, Sundhara, and Sangha in Kavre. An inspection team comprising officials from various agencies will monitor travel arrangements with support from provincial transport ministries.Public transport operating on long and medium-distance routes must follow a designated queue system. Transport expert Ashish Gajurel noted that although bookings are open each year, passengers face difficulties. \"Bus operators don’t increase the number of buses during Dashain, despite rising demand. Authorities must increase the number of buses to ease travel,\" he said.Saroj Sitaula, senior vice-president of the Federation of Nepalese National Transport Entrepreneurs, however, argued that ‘unnecessary’ vehicle checks should be avoided to prevent inconvenience for passengers and drivers. He also highlighted the need to repair potholes on roads to ensure smooth travel.Earlier, Minister for Physical Infrastructure and Transport Devendra Dahal instructed the Department of Roads to complete road repairs nationwide before Ghatasthapana, the first day of the 15-day Dashain festival. The department reported that repairs are underway but have been delayed by the monsoon.The Narayanghat-Butwal road section, part of the East-West Highway, remains a major concern, with only 52.7 percent of its upgrade completed after six years of construction and multiple deadline extensions. The Meteorological Forecasting Division of the Department of Hydrology and Meteorology has predicted chances of rainfall in various places of the country for a couple of days more, raising concerns about travel difficulties during Dashain. Other problematic sections include Nagdhunga-Mugling and Mugling-Pokhara, with landslides and potholes reported along various highways, including the Mid-Hill, Madan Bhandari, Hulaki, and BP highways. \nPanic gripped locals in ward 12 of Chandragiri Municipality, Kathmandu, on Thursday morning after a suspicious object was found in the locality.The suspicious object was spotted in front of Balambu Secondary School, sparking fears of a bomb threat.Locals informed the police, and a bomb disposal team from the Nepal Army arrived at the scene. According to the NA Directorate of Public Relations and Information, the team disposed of the suspicious object, which turned out to be a pressure cooker.   \nKathmandu Metropolitan City has extended the area to prohibit building any structure on either side of the rivers in its territory.In a notice on Wednesday, the city office stated that construction of any structure has been barred on the additional 20 meters from the existing prohibited area.According to the metropolis notice, if the city has, under the existing rule, prohibited any construction on 20 meters from the area marked as river, the prohibited area will now be altogether 40 meters on either side of the waterway.The metropolis said the decision was taken based on a recent Supreme Court verdict that directed the authorities concerned to prohibit construction within an additional 20 metres from riverbanks in the Kathmandu Valley.Currently, construction is permitted only 20 metres beyond major riverbanks in the Kathmandu metropolis.The notice issued by the metropolis states, “No construction will be permitted on an additional 20 metres of land on either side of the river, and ongoing construction will be halted.”It has also asked one and all not to release contaminated water, including sewage, into Bagmati River and its tributaries. “Private and government buildings, as well as commercial properties, must install soak pits for groundwater recharge,” it said. “Waste must not be disposed of in the rivers. Non-compliance will lead to legal action under existing laws.” \nThe rhythmic beat of the Dha echoes through a Bhaktapur alley, blending with the energetic footsteps of dancers. Bhaktapur, which sees jatras and festivals round the year, is no stranger to music, dance and celebrations. But this is not an ordinary occasion. The performers in question are Lakhe dancers who are reviving the Ranjitkar Lakhe dance after a century.The young dancers are preparing for Indra Jatra this year, where mask-clad Lakhe dancers roam the streets to rid the community of hardships and suffering. Lakhe, demon deities revered as protectors of people and crops, are thought to reside in the demonic mask. As the dancer dons the mask, the spirit is said to take over.Bhaktapur was once a key site for the Ranjitkar Lakhe performances, but the art form vanished from the city after the 1934 earthquake.“Bhaktapur suffered the most damage during the 1934 earthquake,\" says Ganesh Ram Ranjit, treasurer of the Ranjitkar Group’s Bhaktapur branch. “The destruction left residents struggling to recover for a decade, making it nearly impossible to perform the costly Lakhe dance.”The Ranjitkar Group discovered the extinct dance in the year the group was established. They located a Lakhe temple in Bhaktapur that had closed after the earthquake. After two years of research, they learned that performing the Lakhe dance was seen as a good omen in Bhaktapur and involved hosting community feasts. However, the high cost of this tradition forced many to sell their properties, rendering it unfeasible in the city’s post-earthquake conditions. Over time, the dance was abandoned as more lands supporting these cultural events were lost during rapid urbanisation.“There was a significant decline in our engagement with our cultural heritage,” says Rabi Shakya, a sculptor and Lakhe dance teacher training the new dancers. “The encouraging change now is the strong interest from the new generation, which is making it possible to revive intangible heritage like this dance.”After 100 years, the Ranjitkar Lakhe Dance is making a return to Bhaktapur at this year’s Indra Jatra.“It’s challenging to accurately re-enact the dance since it hasn’t been seen in a century,” Shakya notes. “As a sculptor, I drew inspiration from Bhaktapur’s revered Shree Navadurga Bhawani to create the Lakhe’s mask.” Similarly, the dance was choreographed by studying Lakhe dances from Kathmandu, Patan, and Banepa within the Ranjitkar community, and combining them with traditional steps from Bhaktapur Lakhe dances.“As for the musical instruments, we are using traditional instruments like Dha, Dhime, and Ponga, which are said to excite the Lakhe,” says Rajendra Maharjan, Lakhe dance teacher and musician.Maharjan is one of the experienced Newari arts teachers working to revive the lost Lakhe dance. He is involved in training young students in cultural arts and is now dedicated to the Ranjitkar dance training, with the students practising together nearly every day.“Becoming a Lakhe performer involves more than just wearing the costume and mask,” said Sudin Ranjit, a Lakhe dance student. “We must train extensively with our teachers, and it demands a lot of hard work.”To Ranjit, a resident of Bhaktapur, the training is more than learning a new craft; it is a matter of protecting culture. Growing up only interested in instruments, he slowly understood how important continuing cultural practices like Lakhe dances is for their community.“The dance will not only bolster Bhaktapur’s cultural pride but also boost tourism and create jobs,” says Dr Purushottam Lochan Shrestha, a professor and researcher specialising in Bhaktapur and Newari culture.Shrestha notes that reviving the dance would offer employment to everyone involved, from the dancers and the sculptor making the masks to those participating in the rituals. “Economic centres throughout the city, from small businesses to large industries, will benefit from the influx of tourists attracted by the Lakhe dance,” Shrestha adds, commending the Ranjitkar group's initiative.Once the Ranjitkar community revitalises the Lakhe dance, the Ranjitkar group plans to set up a new Guthi house with a fresh community fund and organise annual events for the dance.“The Lakhe dance won’t let them separate,” Shakya remarks.In today’s globalised world, where identity often merges into a homogenised blend, shared cultural practices provide a sense of connection and belonging. This new Lakhe dance embodies that spirit of togetherness for the community involved.“Reviving the dance after 100 years,” Shakya says, “is about preserving our culture for the next 300 years.” \nThe Lions Club of Kathmandu Corporate, Nepal MD325-D has felicitated various personalities as part of its endeavour to recognise the contribution of the individuals and business entities for the society.As part of its campaign, the Lions Club of Kathmandu honoured Prateek Pradhan with Social Journalism Award, Sylapa T Rimponche with Social Spiritual Award, Erika Gurung with Social Player Award, Ramesh Corporation with Social Corporate House Award, Rajendra Malla with Social Corporate Leader Award and Rajesh Hamal with Social Celebrity Award.Likewise, Chandra Ghimire is honoured with Social Bureaucratic Award, Binod Das with Sports Management Award, Anil Kedia with Social Academic Award, Mohan Ojha with Social Management Award and Surya Nepal with Corporate Social Responsibility Award.The Lionism embarked in Nepal in 1971 as the Lions Club of Biratnagar under the stewardship of former Prime Minister Matrika Prasad Koirala.The Lions Clubs International says it has over 2,000 clubs operating across the nation. \nFive years ago, on September 30, 2019, when KP Sharma Oli was prime minister for the second time, the government declared the entire country open-defecation free amid much fanfare. However, years later, thousands of people from across the country are getting infected with diarrheal diseases, including scores from cholera.Rautahat is among the nine districts reporting cholera outbreaks this year. Ward 4 of Rajpur Municipality has reported over 100 cases of diarrheal infection and hospitalisation. However, the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division said only 12 people from the municipality had so far contracted cholera.“Over 100 diarrheal patients from the municipality’s ward 4 have been hospitalised,” Khusid Ahmad, a health worker at the municipality, told the Post over the phone from Rautahat. “Contaminated drinking water could be the culprit for the cholera outbreak there. Samples of drinking water collected from affected areas have been sent for lab tests.”Apart from Rautahat, eight other districts—Lalitpur, Kathmandu, Kailali, Pyuthan, Makawanpur, Rolpa, Sindhupalchok, and Achham—have also reported cholera outbreaks this year. So far, the number of diarrheal patients who have contracted cholera is 95. Interestingly, most of the districts that have witnessed outbreaks of deadly cholera this year had years ago been declared open defecation-free.The Vibrio cholera 01 Ogawa serotype has been confirmed in the stool samples of the infected patients. Doctors say that detected cases of cholera infection could be just the tip of the iceberg, as most positive cases are being reported from the districts with active surveillance.Public health experts say outbreaks of cholera in multiple districts, even five years after the country was declared open defecation-free, show a huge gap between official declarations and progress on the ground.They say outbreaks of diarrheal diseases, including cholera, are directly linked to drinking water, sanitation, and hygiene conditions, and the country was declared open defecation-free without improving water and sanitation conditions.“Without ensuring the quality of drinking water and sanitation, among other things, authorities rushed to declare the entire country free from open defecation,” said Dr Mingmar Gyelgen Sherpa, former director general at the Department of Health Services. “Instead of improving basic water and sanitation infrastructure, we’ve focussed too much on outbreak management, and this is the wrong approach.”Even though toilets have been built in most households, open defecation is still widespread in many places. Drinking water samples collected from various parts of the country, including from the districts of the Kathmandu Valley, have been found contaminated with faecal coliform, which means the water the public uses for drinking is unsafe. The presence of faecal coliform, a microscopic organism that thrives in the intestines of warm-blooded animals or their faeces, indicates sewage contamination in the drinking water, according to doctors.A previous study had shown that 81 percent of water samples collected in the Kathmandu Valley were contaminated with deadly microbes.“We only focussed on expanding coverage of drinking water but did not pay attention to ensuring its safety,” said Dr Meghnath Dhimal, chief researcher at the Nepal Health Research Council. “Authorities concerned must also focus on improving the quality.”Experts say improving public hygiene is essential to ensuring water quality and avoiding diarrheal ailments. Awareness drives and health education play a crucial role in changing behaviours, which requires years of investment and continuous efforts.Along with investment in health education, attention should go to building climate-resilient infrastructures for drinking water and sanitation, as water resources have been contaminated by floodwaters in many districts. The effects of climate change have increased adverse events, including floods, which in turn have contaminated the source of drinking water, making people vulnerable to infection with diarrheal ailments.“Multiple agencies of the three tiers of government and non-governmental sectors have to make more effort to prevent diarrhoea outbreaks,” said Sherpa. “But there seems to be a lack of coordination among government agencies.” The World Health Organisation also stresses on a multifaceted approach as a key to controlling cholera and reducing deaths. \nUS President Joe Biden will announce on Tuesday the donation of 1 million mpox vaccine doses and at least $500 million to African countries to support their response to the outbreak, according to a senior administration official.Biden will make the announcement in New York, where he is attending the United Nations General Assembly, and call on other countries to follow suit, the person told Reuters.In August, the World Health Organization declared mpox a global public health emergency for the second time in two years, following an outbreak of the viral infection in the Democratic Republic of Congo that has spread to neighbouring countries and beyond, including India, raising alarm.“It wouldn’t be a huge surprise if there were a case in the United States, either,” the official said, noting that recent cuts in pandemic support by Congress may hamper a domestic response.“We’re really squeezing right now to be able to respond effectively in this moment. And I think anticipating potentially additional cuts in the future will make it more and more difficult for us to have a robust response to these types of outbreaks.”Mpox can spread through close contact. Usually mild, it is fatal in rare cases. It causes flu-like symptoms and pus-filled lesions on the body.The outbreak in Congo began with the spread of an endemic strain, known as clade I. But a new variant, clade Ib, appears to spread more easily through routine close contact, including sexual contact.The expectation is that the US donated doses will be of the Bavarian Nordic vaccine known as Jynneos in the United States, and many will come from a stockpile in the United States. The 1 million doses is in addition to the 60,000 previously donated shots.The US official said the administration expects Gavi, a public-private alliance which co-funds vaccine purchases for low-income countries, to distribute the donated vaccines.“We feel really strongly that Gavi is the multilateral institution that is best positioned to procure and equitably distribute vaccines,” the official said.Last week, Gavi said it will buy 500,000 doses of Bavarian Nordic's vaccine, its first purchase to help battle the outbreak.The Biden administration is also pushing for more vaccines to be manufactured in low and middle-income countries, and is working with Brazil to identify how the Group of 20 club of nations can support the mpox response.There is not currently a manufacturer in Africa that is able to make the complex drug substance needed to make the vaccine, the US official said. \nAt least 190 women from 51 districts died of complications during childbirth in the fiscal year 2023-024, data provided by the Family Welfare Division under the Department of Health Services show. The actual number of maternal deaths due to birth-related complications could be much higher, as maternal and perinatal death surveillance is being carried out in 51 districts only, officials say.“Maternal deaths from childbirth-related complications could be significantly underreported, as we are only tracking cases in 51 districts,” said Nisha Joshi, a public health official at the division. “We have no data on maternal and perinatal deaths in the rest of the districts.”In the fiscal year 2022-023, 191 maternal deaths were recorded across 49 districts. Nepal reduced the maternal mortality rate from 239 per 100,000 births in 2016 to 151 per 100,000 in 2021, according to the national census carried out by the National Statistics Office. Earlier, the country had reduced the maternal mortality rate from 539 per 100,000 births in 1996 to 239 per 100,000 births in 2016—for which the country even received a Millennium Development Goals award. The health target under the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals is to reduce the maternal mortality rate to 75 per 100,000 births by 2030.The latest census report has shown that 622 maternal deaths were recorded in a year. Officials at the Health Ministry concede that the number of deaths reported from 51 districts is only around 30 percent of the total maternal deaths occurring across the country.They complained that the lack of maternal and perinatal death surveillance programmes in all districts is the main reason for the underreporting of maternal deaths. “Due to budget constraints, we could not expand the maternal and perinatal death surveillance to other districts this year,” said Joshi. “We also have problems in the reporting system, and deaths that occur in villages of the districts without surveillance programmes go unreported.”Maternal health experts say that concerned authorities are keeping themselves in the dark by not conducting studies in all districts. “Without knowing the actual situation, effective planning is not possible, which means efforts to reduce ongoing deaths may not succeed,” said Dr Ganesh Dangal, a maternal health expert. A huge budget is not necessary to carry out death surveillance. So this programme should be enforced mandatorily in all districts immediately.”Maternal and perinatal death surveillance is a key intervention for improving maternal, perinatal, and neonatal survival rates. Experts say such surveillance provides an understanding of the number and causes of deaths, enabling more targeted and effective interventions.Nepal strives to reduce the deaths of mothers and babies. However, it lacks maternal and perinatal death surveillance in all districts.Perinatal death is the death of a baby between 22 weeks of gestation (or weighing 500g) and seven days after birth.The World Health Organisation said that maternal and perinatal death surveillance and response (MPDSR) is an essential quality improvement intervention, which permits the identification, notification, quantification and determination of causes and avoidability of maternal and neonatal deaths and stillbirth to orient the measures necessary for their prevention.According to the UN health body, systematic analyses of overall mortality trends and events and contributing factors leading to individual deaths can identify barriers in health systems and inspire local solutions to prevent such deaths in the future.Studies carried out in the past show that excessive bleeding after childbirth, pre-eclampsia and eclampsia (pregnancy-related high blood pressure disorders) are some of the reasons for maternal deaths.The World Health Organisation said postpartum haemorrhage is the leading cause of maternal mortality in low-income countries and the primary cause of nearly a quarter of all maternal deaths globally. Most deaths resulting from the said complication occur during the first 24 hours after birth.Gynaecologists say tears in the cervix or tissues of the vagina, tear in a blood vessel in the uterus, bleeding in hidden tissue area or space in the pelvis, blood clotting disorders, and placenta problems are among the causes of postpartum haemorrhage.Every year, over 600,000 women deliver babies in Nepal. \nJapanese encephalitis outbreak in Nepal has killed 17 since June, with 29 districts reporting infections and 12 experiencing deaths, prompting health officials to seek vaccine aid due to high child mortality and low vaccination rates.\nA Kathmandu woman's lead poisoning diagnosis highlights a rise in heavy metal poisoning cases linked to dietary supplements, ayurvedic medicines, and other sources, raising concerns about the lack of antidotes in Nepal.\nDusit Princess Kathmandu hosts a 5-day trout festival at SOI restaurant, featuring 12 unique dishes showcasing flavors from Nepal, India, the Orient, and various cuisines, highlighting the versatility of locally sourced trout.\nA young baker's initial misadventures lead to a passion for understanding the science behind baking, resulting in tips and tricks to overcome common baking challenges.\nIn the face of prevalent judgment and safety concerns, LGBTQIA+ individuals have found a haven in Inclusive Galaxy Restaurant in Kathmandu, a space that echoes the legacy of the Stonewall Riots, fostering a sense of community, acceptance, and hope for a more inclusive society.\nNepali chef Aditya Mishra promotes Nepali cuisine in New York through his restaurant 'The Sewing Tin,' using modern culinary techniques to elevate traditional dishes like kachaila and chatamari.\nCeleus Baral exudes a serene aura when you meet her, and when she tells you she bakes, it makes sense. Even during a brief encounter, you can tell she has the patience needed to be a baker.“You can eyeball cooking, but baking is chemistry. You have to be meticulous. You cannot rush it, or it does not turn out as expected,” says the 21-year-old environment science student. She also runs the online baking shop Bakeleus. Recently, she has also started selling her baked goods beyond her online shop, with her first stall appearing at The Yellow House’s Night Market. Bakeleus’s menu lists a variety of offerings, including jams, granola, tarts, cakes, cookies, cupcakes and brownies. Baral began baking in 2020, during the lockdown, and launched her online shop last year.She grows much of the produce she incorporates into her baking, and believes we should all understand the origins of our food. “This connection fosters gratitude and a deeper appreciation for nature,” she says. Her background in environmental science, coupled with her affinity for the natural world, imbues her creations with a unique artistic sensibility. Each item she bakes is a testament to her creativity and experimentation, as she believes consistent practice is the key to mastery.Despite the demands of being a full-time student, Baral strives to accommodate orders, typically requiring a minimum of 72 hours' notice for delivery. She is a passionate and discerning individual, evident in the love she infuses into her baking. Additionally, Baral advocates for a zero-waste policy at home, ensuring that every scrap of food and all household items are recycled.Three easy to bake recipes you can try at homeMini carrot cakes Ingredients:38 g milk or yoghurt35 g all-purpose flour1/4 tea spoon ground cinnamon1/8 tea spoon ground gingerA pinch of cardamom1 tea spoon baking powder½ tea spoon fine sea salt2 large eggs, at room temperature27 g granulated sugar13 g brown sugar (or 39 g of regular granulated sugar)1 tea spoon vanilla extract27 g extra virgin olive oil33 g carrots, peeled and shreddedChopped walnutsCandied lemon or orange slices (optional for garnish)Cream cheese frosting56.5 g unsalted butter, softened113.5 g cream cheese, softened1/2 teaspoon vanilla extractA pinch of salt250 g powdered sugarDirections:For the cake:Preheat the oven to 195°C.

Yet, pockets of the past remain—small, peaceful neighbourhoods where houses are still made of wood, paths are made of stone tiles, and the stillness of a world that wants to stay intact and immobile. These places are known for tourism, culture, and the restoration of community pride. One such stop is the quiet village of Khokana in southern Lalitpur.Khokana is comparatively close to the mainland urban Lalitpur; from the ring road junction of Bagdole, it takes only a 10-minute drive to reach there. From the airport, you can take a cab directly to Khokana, which will take around half an hour. Get your cameras and hiking boots ready; the area is filled with historical artefacts and hiking trails.However, it is vastly different from the city. It is much nearer to the hills, where stone-paved paths, which could easily be goat trails, are rare in today’s Kathmandu.One such goat trail leads to Sikali temple, a major attraction of the area and accessible only on foot. The pavements are lined with big and small temples on each side, along with ponds that serve as clean water sources and a location for religious rituals. The houses are made of bricks and wood. The concrete invasion, although present, is minimal. Scattered every few hundred metres are small mustard oil mills, co-operative businesses of the locals of Khokana that have existed since medieval times.A site well-recognised for its historical significance, Khokana was even proposed to be made a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1996. Sikali TempleAround an hour’s walk from the historic town, Sikali Temple can be reached, which is also the location for its famed Sikali Jatra.While it can be reached through any public vehicle, a more holistic and adventurous route is to follow the goat trails on the outskirts of Khokana. This route, albeit long, allows for great hiking opportunities, scenic views of the hills surrounding the Kathmandu Valley, and a close-up view of the mediaeval but well-maintained architecture of the local houses.Even if you lose the way, which is very possible, the locals are very welcoming and more than willing to guide you. The main temple itself is three stories tall, and built in the Pagoda style, a common style in many temples in the valley.It is surrounded by a lush grass field which plays the stage to the Sikali Jatra held every year. The temple, like many religious spots around Khokana, is dedicated to the local deity Shree Rudrayani.The Sikali Jatra, a five-day festival that serves as an alternative to Dashain for the Khokana locals, is filled with chariot dances, battle enactments, and storytelling celebrations in the worship of Goddess Rudrayani.Starting from Ghatasthapana in mid to late September, the Jatra is vibrant and an essential experience for every visitor. Historical Khokana townKhokana’s historical town is located around 5 minutes walking distance from the local bus park. The town complex, paved with hand-made stone tiles, is graced with the Indrayanee temple but also has many red-bricked houses built in the local Newari architecture, some of them centuries old.One such house is the ‘Khokana Museum’. Although closed, it is widely popular for being the first house to be lit with electricity in Nepal, as Chandra Shamsher did in 1911.The stand-holder of the first light bulb can still be seen, serving as a historical monument for everyone to see.Similarly, the town complex is also filled with Guthi houses, small ponds, and even the local Ward office. While the Ward office provides a wealth of information for visitors interested in the area’s history, the Guthi halls symbolise the strong community support culture of the locals.The ponds, a notable one present right opposite the Indrayanee temple, have stone taps and remind us of primitive ways of obtaining clean water—a practice many locals are still engaged in.Yet, these ponds are also religious locations, especially used in rituals in the Sikali Jatra.Finally, a stroll through the complex allows visitors to explore old houses and historical artefacts in the serene quietness of Khokana, while the small outlets and Choila places nearby allow you to enjoy the spicy duck or chicken delicacies at the same time.Overall, the historical complex is enough to transport visitors back to a glimpse of the medieval past of the Kathmandu Valley. Mustard oil millsThe most well-known feature of Khokana is its mustard oil mills, which have been operational for hundreds of years and have been using the same methods of preparation since their inception.These mills, scattered throughout Khokana, are often community-owned, and even the ones owned by certain individuals have almost exclusively employed locals.Despite the advent of modern machinery, there is still substantial demand for their products due to the assured guarantee.When I visited one such mill, the local staff informed me that the furnace and oil presser used by them were 300 years old, given by the Patan royalty even before the Shahs became king.In addition to buying pure, organically created mustard oil and pellets, visiting these oil mills offers many educational benefits for international and local tourists alike.Khokana offers visitors a unique glimpse into a preserved bubble of the past through its tranquillity, preservation of ancient lifestyle and cultural elements, and remarkable self-sustenance.  \n“How much oxygen do you have for the summit?”I think this is the kind of question a film producer would ask. But when you're on the mountain, the answer is never clear.I have worked for a long time in the film industry and different art areas, especially photography and engraving.Working in various fields and drawing inspiration from them has become a new normal for me. I have made this approach my way of life without even realising it.I took responsibility for producing the last movie I worked on and shot the behind-the-scenes footage for a documentary. By doing so, I witnessed the entire shooting process and the journey of a movie.In the snowy highlands of Turkey, we had to endure the consequences of the changing climate to shoot ‘About Dry Grasses’, directed by Nuri Bilge Ceylan. The highlands used to be snowy in January, but by the time we got there in the same month, there was no snow. Nature was changing. It was responding to what was happening—to what humanity had done to it. In the end, it snowed, and we shot the intense snow scenes we wanted. But since most of our days were sunny, unlike what the director wanted, we had to shoot in the sunset and sunrise hours. As crew members, we spent many days waiting for the sun to set.Production requires creating opportunities, finding solutions, and being creative for a work of art to come true. For this, patience, endurance, calmness, and timing are necessary. On the other hand, nature wanted us to listen to it and wait for the right time.During that time, I witnessed many of nature's lessons. For example, I experienced extreme cold for the first time. We endured temperatures ranging from -33 degrees to +55 degrees. By listening to nature, surrendering to its forces, and working within its limits, we managed to persevere.No matter how much you prepare or plan during the pre-production phase, if you are working in nature, remember that nature will always have the final say.The film was completed, released, and connected with audiences. Its success at Cannes 2023 was followed by my trip to the North Pole for my project. I returned with a mix of wonderful developments, joys, and challenges. During this process, I experienced life and death, happiness and sadness, losses and awards.I realised the value of being able to breathe comfortably a few days after my father's chemotherapy ended. Just a few days earlier, he had said, \"Well done, my daughter. I'm glad you went!\" All the anxiety and hard work, filled with fears at the beginning, were finally behind me.Before going to Everest, when I was on the verge of giving up, defeated by my fears, I remembered my father's words. Everest reminded me of what he said while struggling to breathe, adding a turning point to my life.What does it mean to say ‘life’s turning point?’ How many turning points can there be in life?Who am I, and what am I doing in this world? How well do I know my own limits? Can I find answers to these big questions? These thoughts sparked my dream of journeying to Everest. Now, after returning, I can say that it turned my life around.“How much oxygen do you need for the summit?” sounds more like “How much do you need to hold on to life?” How many reasons do you find that give meaning to your life, keep you alive, and allow you to breathe? How much can you endure in the face of obstacles, and can you keep believing that a solution will eventually come your way?Can these questions be separated from the idea of measuring and assessing something, from learning its quantity and financial value? Can everything be known with certainty? Should the journey be fully understood in advance, with all its promises laid out? Should it be viewed like a purchase with a price tag, asking, “Is this journey worth this much?”I had never trekked before and had no climbing experience. I had lived at sea level my entire life and had never been to a high altitude.However, this journey was not only about the physical climb but also an inner discovery. After losing my father to lung cancer, his breathing difficulties taught me the fragility of breath, life, and existence. I also mentally prepared myself for the physical challenges I might face. Despite all my concerns, could this journey help me understand the cycle of life and the resilience of the soul?So, how could I make this trek possible? How could I land in Nepal? Despite all the economic difficulties and the many things I felt needed organising, I did my best and believed in it.Since I was embarking on this journey, I felt I should share about my travels and inspire others.Starting with photography, cinema, and engraving, which are already integral parts of my life, I dreamed of documenting and sharing the inspiring aspects of this journey.After months of correspondence and dreaming, it all came true. Finally, I embarked on the journey with the goal of creating photographs, engravings, and documentaries. I learned a great deal from my travels in Nepal, from the people I met, and from every moments I witnessed. I felt incredibly fortunate to have been able to honour my father’s memory with the peace and serenity I experienced in the Himalayas.During my 15-day journey to Everest Base Camp, I encountered nature’s masterpieces at every turn. As concerns like “How will I endure?” and “How will I finish?” started to weigh on me, the mountains suddenly parted with the clouds and gazed down at me.It was amazing to witness the appearance of ‘Gods’ that I had never seen before, in such immense size and in such a close, awe-inspiring manner beside me during that silent walk.As someone who came from one of the most crowded cities in the world, Istanbul, while I struggled with my daily questions and uncertainties, trying to control everything, they stood there calmly, as if answering me.They were just there—before and after.My guide, Lakhpa Sherpa, always reminded me not to worry about how high we were, how long it would take to reach our accommodation, or what the weather would be like. He encouraged me to live in the moment, and he was right.He advised me to focus on my breathing, not to get thirsty, to eat enough, and to appreciate the extraordinary beauty of the journey. In the mountains, plans dissolve and each moment is embraced as it comes.All the good wishes, prayers, and everything encountered along the way were for the journey itself. The mountain was full of life, secrets, and everything I had wondered about.This 15-day journey to Everest Base Camp was a solo adventure, yet I wouldn't have been able to complete it without my guide, Lhakpa, and my porter. Additionally, I was fortunate enough to experience the hospitality, generosity, and honesty at Trekkers Paradise, which organised the entire journey and provided guidance.I witnessed how dedication and sincerity are crucial in completing a journey safely and healthily. Ghanshyam Sharma, from Trekkers Paradise and Sauraj Jhingan, a climber who summited the Everest in 2018, shared their experiences with me during the journey.They experienced the 2015 earthquake while they were at the Everest Base Camp.As a filmmaker, their role as actors, and attention to detail played a significant role in bringing my dream photography and documentary project to life.The sponsors of my journey were Turkish Airlines, The North Face, Apple, Canon, and Stanley. My supporters include Oscar International College and Nepal Film Campus. Throughout the journey, I shared many experiences, memories, and countless photos and images with my students.On my way back home after 21 days, I celebrated my birthday on the plane. From the right window, the Himalayas bid me farewell. I felt like I had opened a new chapter in my life, and I was certain that I would return.I had made many friends and memories in Nepal.For now, I will be working on a documentary and preparing for a photography and engraving exhibition titled ‘My Soul Beyond the Mountain’.To the Himalayas: This summer was spent with you, but we will meet again soon. \nWe spent five days in Sri Lanka two weeks ago, driving up and down the island, covering almost 70 percent of its territory. Our tour spanned over 1,000 kilometres, including hills, beach spots, and heritage and religious sites.Our first stop in Sri Lanka was Colombo’s Bandaranaike International Airport. We were greeted by a warm and humid breeze when we exited the airport. The host briefed us (a group of journalists) that heavy rainfall has affected areas across Sri Lanka since mid-May 2024. Rain and storms intensified on June 1, with the most significant effects in the south and west of the country. We were lucky to have no rain in the forecast.On the first night, we checked into the lavish Jetwing Lake resort, an opulent sanctuary amidst the lush landscape. The resort’s expansive grounds were a retreat, offering a glimpse of Sri Lanka's natural beauty. We feasted on delicious cuisine, every bite exploding with flavour, introducing us to the island’s famed culinary delights. On June 7, early morning, the sun shone brightly, previewing the promise of an incredible journey ahead. We set off early the following day, eager to explore the mysteries of this enchanting island. As we ventured further into the heart of Sri Lanka, the landscape revealed its majestic nature. We were astounded by seeing Pidurangala Rock, a 200-metre-high granite colossus just a kilometre north of Sigiriya. The short hike to Pidurangala Rock offered breathtaking views of Sigiriya and beyond. We climbed the steep steps and soon were rewarded with a breathtaking panoramic view of the surrounding landscape. It took us 30 minutes to climb. The sight took our breaths away and left us humbled in the presence of such grandeur. From the top are glorious vistas of the surrounding landscape and an incredible view of the majestic Sigiriya Rock. From there, Sigiriya Lion’s Rock is visible, standing alone. This was the place where demon king Ravana had his palace in the Treta Yuga. Believed to have been built 50 centuries ago, the palace is said to have had a unique lift for Ravana and his visitors. Ravana imprisoned Sita in one of the caves at the bottom of this humongous boulder. Sigiriya is a fifth-century fortress in Sri Lanka carved out of an inselberg, a hill of hard volcanic rock that soared high above the surrounding jungle. We spent two hours atop the rock, mainly taking photographs. We descended from Pidurangala Rock, filled with awe and a sense of accomplishment.The journey ahead seemed even more enticing as we ventured along the winding roads, heading towards our next destination.Cash-strapped Sri Lanka plunged into its worst financial crisis in more than seven decades in 2022, with a severe dollar shortage sending inflation soaring to a high of 70 percent, its currency to record lows, and its economy contracting 7.3 percent.Thanks to the growing number of tourists, Sri Lanka is now bouncing back.In Jetwing Lake, we met Kasun Pradeep Somasiri, a receptionist. He briefed us that the resort is now 50 percent occupied. “That’s a better figure now as we are recovering.”The travel and tourism sector is a significant income generator for Sri Lanka. However, the economic crisis, the Ukraine–Russia war, and China’s zero-Covid policy have jeopardised the industry.Tourism accounted for more than 12 percent of the country’s GDP in 2019 and was the third-largest source of foreign exchange reserves, behind worker remittances and the apparel industry.Sri Lanka was poised to be one of the world’s best holiday destinations due to its rich culture, wealth of natural resources, and diversity of accessible experiences.However, tourism-dependent Sri Lanka suffered its first major setback with the Easter bombings 2019. This led to the collapse of inbound tourism flows as international arrivals declined by 18 percent year-on-year, and tourist expenditure fell by 17.7 percent that year. This was immediately followed by two years of pandemic restrictions. Inbound visitors fell to just 116,600 in 2021.An acute balance of payments crisis forced Sri Lanka to preemptively default on foreign debt of over $50 billion in April 2022, triggering a crippling economic contraction with spiralling inflation.“Tourism is gaining momentum,” says Somasiri. “The British and Chinese have started to return to Sri Lanka.”January-August is the peak season for foreigners. “From December to April, local people travel for holiday purposes,” says Somasiri. Before we started the tour to other religious sites, our tour guide, Sampath Mayadunne, told us, “Don't take selfies with your back to Buddha.” Turning your back on a Buddha statue and some other religious sites to take photos and videos is a strict no-no.The most common sight across Sri Lanka is the tank cascades system, an ancient irrigation infrastructure. The system is a network of small tanks draining to large reservoirs that store rainwater and surface runoff for later use.“These infrastructures were built by its ancient kings over 2,000 years ago to solve the water scarcity in the country’s dry zone,” says Mayadunne.On day two, we travelled to Ranweli Spice Garden in Matale. This garden is famous for its rare spices and herbs. A tour of the gardens will show you the cultivation, harvesting, cleaning, and packaging process, as well as the health benefits and uses of the herbs.On the way, we saw a colourful Muthumariamman Hindu temple, boasting hundreds of detailed sculptures in a rich mosaic of colour.In Kandy, we visited the Temple of the Tooth Relic (Sri Dalada Maligawa), one of the most sacred places of worship in the Buddhist world. It was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1988.The temple sustained damage from bombings by Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna in 1989 and by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam in 1998. However, it was fully restored each time.We then headed to Jetwing St Andrew’s, a luxurious 5-star property in Sri Lanka’s hill country of Nuwara Eliya, situated at 1,900 metres above sea level. During our stay in Kandy, we immersed ourselves in the city's charm and the serenity of the countryside. On the third day, early morning, we travelled to Nuwara Eliya, the area famous for tea estates that give many Nepalis the feeling that they have come to Kanyam, Ilam, in eastern Nepal.We visited a tea factory called Damro Labookellie Tea Centre, the oldest tea centre in Sri Lanka. Due to its cold climate, it is the most important area for tea production in Sri Lanka.In this tea factory, they make white and black tea, while the green tea is processed in another tea factory and then sent to Damro.After the tea factory tour and the tea tasting, we headed to Galle, our next resting point.We encountered narrow, winding, and maze-like streets and alleys in Nuwara Eliya, known as ‘Little England’. The town has preserved almost all its British-era buildings and is calm and beautiful. On our way to Galle, at the roadside, our tour guide stopped us at the famed Sita temple, which has Hanuman's footprints and is the place where Sita, wife of Lord Rama, was held captive by the demon king Ravana after he abducted her from India.We were at Sita Eliya, a temple named Sri Seethai Amman.When we reached the Hindu temple, rich in vibrant colours and architectural elements, it was full of devotees. The water stream adjoining the temple is believed to be where Sita bathed. Large footprints are found on the stones in the stream, and there is a saying that those belong to Hanuman, who came spying to find Sita’s whereabouts.In Ella, Ravana’s waterfalls are significant in the Rama-Ravana story. The cascade charms visitors from all over the globe. The waterfall is easily accessible and is known to have hidden caves at the top, which are believed to have been used as Ravana's residence.The 25-metre-tall waterfall is a beautiful cascade that provides the perfect backdrop for a photo to remember your Ramayana trail adventures in Sri Lanka. A short pilgrimage tour ended there, and it was now time for an adventure. Though it was not part of our itinerary, our guide decided to tour us on a train ride.Though short, only six kilometres from Ella to Demodera, it was thrilling. Everyone screamed in unison like kids on a fair ride to hear the echoes in the dark every time we passed through the tunnels. The sound of the train is subtly different inside a tunnel. For the first-timer, the darkness and shouts inside the tunnels when the train passes would be scary, like a horror movie.The train we boarded wasn’t crowded, but people had already filled the doorway, ready for the scenic journey.With the shrill sound of a whistle, the train slowly pulled away from the platform at Ella, passing houses, coconut trees and green fields.As the train progressed, tourists and locals were leaning out the windows and crowding to hang out the doors. I joined the crowd and hung out on a train. A short excitement ended there.After lunch, we headed to Galle and reached Jetwing Lighthouse. As soon as our group entered the hotel, they shouted with excitement.The hotel is on a rocky outcrop three miles west of Galle. Waves crash over giant boulders in front of it and produce howling winds.We were at Galle’s 17th-century fort five minutes from the hotel on day four. In the Bay of Galle on the southwest coast of Sri Lanka, Galle Fort was built first in 1588 by the Portuguese and lavishly rebuilt by the Dutch during the 17th century. It is a historical, archaeological and architectural heritage monument that maintains a perfect appearance even after more than 436 years.We then reached Hikkaduwa Beach, a popular beach destination on the southern coast of Sri Lanka. On the way, we saw a 30-metre-high Big Buddha Statue. It is a replica of the 6th-century Buddhas of Bamiyan destroyed by the Taliban in Afghanistan. It was created using the earliest known sketches of the statue. It was built in remembrance of the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami victims.We then travelled through the 222-kilometre-long Southern Expressway, Sri Lanka's first expressway linking the capital, Colombo, with Galle, Matara, and Hambantota, significant cities south of the island.On day five, we reached Colombo, the capital of Sri Lanka. Jetwing Colombo Seven hosted us in the bustling capital. We took a city tour early morning and visited Bally's Casino at night.On day six, we returned to Kathmandu early in the morning on a Sri Lankan Airlines flight, the airline that organised the trip in coordination with Jetwing Hotels Limited, a Sri Lankan hotel chain.National flag carrier Nepal Airlines, in its previous avatar as Royal Nepal Airlines, used to operate direct flights to Colombo during the 1980s. However, the carrier suspended operations following an armed movement by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) in Sri Lanka. There had been no direct air links between the two countries for decades.In 2016, Himalaya Airlines started a chartered flight that lasted a few months due to low traffic movement between the two countries. Sri Lankan Airlines started operating direct flights to Kathmandu in August 2021.“The main objective of this media tour is to increase tourism in both countries for mutual benefit. We want to draw Nepalis for pilgrims and leisure activities,” says Nilina Pathirana, Country Manager at Srilankan Airlines in Nepal.“We have understood that Nepali travellers tend to travel to Bangkok, Vietnam, Malaysia, Dubai, and Maldives. Nepalis have quite minimal knowledge about Sri Lanka and the religious connection between Lanka and Nepal. We want to promote Nepal and Sri Lanka jointly. This will be a win-win business,” added Pathirana.The airline said it currently carries 60 percent of the passengers from Nepal to Sri Lanka and beyond destinations like Tokyo, Sydney, Melbourne, and other Middle Eastern destinations. The return airfare for a 3.5-hour-long flight starts at Rs74,000. “We have a four-night, five-day package that begins from Rs80,000, depending on the properties and extended itineraries,” says Pathirana.Nepalis must submit certain required documents for visa processing, like their passport copy and bank statement. Due to this government-to-government policy, only Nepalis must obtain a prior visa. Otherwise, Sri Lankans are required to have a visa upon arrival.“The other best thing is that Sri Lankan Airlines can be involved with the visa process or facilitate the Nepalis tourists. Our main intention is to have a sustainable market in Kathmandu and make it a daily flight,” says Pathirana. \nMundhum Trek in Koshi province in the eastern part of Nepal is a new cultural walking trail. It passes through several indigenous ethnic villages and landscapes in Khotang and Bhojpur districts. This trail goes up to an elevation of 4,200 metres to the viewpoint of Silchung Peak and takes one through the settlements of the Kirati people. This route starts from Diktel Bazaar and passes through beautiful settlements like Chakhewa, Rawa Dhap, Salpa Bhanjyang, Silchung and Hanspokhari before ending in Bhojpur. There are some hotels in Diktel but trekkers are advised to carry tents. The trail offers panoramic views of most of the eight-thousanders, including Everest, Lhotse, Makalu, Cho Oyu and Kanchenjunga mountains. The spring season, March through May, is highly recommended for the trek.Janaki Mandir Janaki Mandir at Janakpur in Madhesh province was constructed in 1874 and is a blend of Mughal and local architecture. The temple is a three-storey building and has 60 rooms, making it the largest temple in Nepal. Pilgrims flock here by the thousands to pay homage to Janaki Mandir—Janaki being the other name of Sita, the daughter of King Janak. The temple houses an idol of Sita which was found near Ayodhya, the kingdom of Ram. The marriage anniversary of Lord Ram and Sita is celebrated in Janakpur every year on Vivaha Panchami, which falls in December. In the southwest corner of Janaki Mandir is the Vivaha Mandap, which has been built at the site where the marriage of Ram and Sita is said to have taken place. Another well-known temple in the vicinity is Ram Mandir, which is built in pagoda style and is hence different from the other temples in Janakpur that generally bear resemblance to Mughal architecture. It houses a female statue, said to be of Yogamaya, which has the reputation of being one of the most beautiful images of female forms in Nepal. Other holy sites of interest include the Laxman Temple, Sankat Mochan Temple and Hanuman Temple.Kuri Village, Kalinchok Kuri village, a popular tourist destination around 150 km from Kathmandu, lies at an altitude of 3,842 metres above sea level in Kalinchowk of Dolakha district, in Bagmati province. People visit the place to enjoy the snow during the winter besides the mesmerising landscapes and splendid panoramic view of the Himalayan range. Kalinchok gets snow mainly at the end of December and the snowfall continues till the end of February or mid-March. When there is snow, it is difficult for jeeps, buses and cars to reach the top of Kuri village. Chains are wrapped around the wheels of vehicles and specially modified jeeps with highly experienced drivers are used to carry visitors. There are several hotels and restaurants in the area. The road up to Kuri has also improved over the years.Annapurna Base Camp Annapurna Base Camp trek, in Gandaki province, makes for a picturesque journey that takes you to the foothills of the Annapurna South, up to 4,130 metres above sea level. The five-day trek (seven days for slow walkers) offers rich cultural diversities, typical Nepali villages and the flora and fauna nestled at the foothills of Annapurna. The distance from Pokhara to Annapurna Base Camp is approximately 81 kilometres. It is among the shortest and most budget-friendly treks in Nepal. For Nepalis, lodging costs around $5 to $10 per day. For foreigners, the overall cost of the trek ranges from $800 to $1500 on average per person. Annapurna Base Camp trek can be done at any time throughout the year as each season offers a different trekking experience. The ideal time for the trek depends on your weather preferences and what you expect from it. However, autumn (September to October) and spring (March to May) are considered the two best seasons for the trek, as the days at the time are warm and bright with clear skies.Bardiya National Park Bardiya National Park, located in the southern Tarai belt of Lumbini province, is home to one of the most elusive and majestic animals on earth—the Royal Bengal Tiger. The park, which covers an area of 968 square kilometres, is considered one of the most important protected areas in the country. It is a prime destination for those looking to catch a glimpse of a tiger. A bit of luck and patience will offer a good chance to see the Bengal Tiger. The jungle safari also offers one the opportunity to spot Asian elephants and the greater one-horned rhinoceros. The rare Gangetic river dolphins are occasionally spotted on rafting trips along the Geruwa River, the eastern channel of the Karnali river. Besides, visitors can enjoy the homestays and explore local Tharu culture. The right time to visit the park is from mid-September to mid-December and mid-February to May.Khaptad National Park Khaptad National Park in Sudurpaschim province is a protected area in the far western region. It stretches over four districts of Bajhang, Bajura, Achham and Doti and ranges in elevation from 1,400 to 3,300 metres. The park can be visited throughout the year. Trekkers are advised to bring their tents, food and other supplies. The Nepal Tourism Board says of late, social media has been increasingly influencing Nepali travellers to go to Khaptad. Since the far-flung Khaptad National Park is still offbeat for many travellers, the area remains pristine and fresh. The seasons of spring (March-May) and autumn (October-November) are the ideal times to visit the park. The temperature ranges from 10°c to 20°c offering pleasant trekking weather. The monsoon begins in June and lasts until September and during this time, roads often become muddy and slippery. From December to February, winter brings snow and chilling winds to the park.Limi Valley \nOnce again, my heart swelled with joy when my hometown came into view.Arriving at Lalikharka after the treacherous journey through Pauwa Bhanjyang and the bustling Kanchhi Dokan, Phidim, the headquarters of Panchthar district, revealed itself like a surprise gift. My home town, Phidim, is unique in the fact that it reveals to travellers approaching it from uphill. As the vehicle descends the mountain road, it slowly comes into view, its houses and buildings recognisable for the native son.This Dashain, I undertook the much-awaited trip to my hometown with my wife Kabita and daughter Aarohi. Little did I anticipate the transformation that awaited me.The moment I got out of the jeep, I noticed that Phidim, nestled in the lush hills, has undergone a remarkable transformation over the years. As I guided my family to my home, which had suffered damages in the 1989 quake that struck eastern Nepal, I found that old, mud and stone houses had been replaced by concrete buildings. The place was vastly different from the one I remembered.Arriving at my childhood home felt like reuniting with an old friend. Navigating its nooks and crannies with my daughter, we delved into the history of the house, a symbol of my cherished memories.My wife had visited Phidim years ago, spending a month with my parents. She, too, recalled beautiful moments she had had in the town. I asked the tenant about the neighbours and acquaintances. Some had died, while others had left for good.A call to local journalist Giriraj Banskota led me to the school grounds, where memories flooded back. This was where I spent my teenage years, playing ball, learning to kick, and watching major tournaments. Here, I even encountered a group of Western climbers headed to Kanchenjunga, the world’s third-highest mountain. I remember being awed by their shiny yellow tents, headlights and strange smell. I remember practising my tutephuteko Angrezi with the climbers. Birendra Shield, an annual sports tournament named after the late king, brought ace players from various schools in Panchthar district. The district also hosted Yuba Mela, an annual three-day fair to commemorate the birthday of the king, organising football tournaments in which teams from as far as Sunsari and Taplejung participated. I never excelled at dribbling balls. A boy growing up in a seven-member family, I soon found my interest in literature. In the late 1980s, Phidim hosted a major literary festival. In the run-up to the 1990 pro-democracy protest, walls were painted with anti-monarchy slogans, local politicians were arrested. I took my family to my school, Naya Namuna Secondary School. It was Saturday, so the school was closed. I peeked through the steel gate and wall, imagining myself labouring over classes. Memories are hazy, but what I remember most is going out of the school—to quiz contests with me leading the school team, to essay competitions at the District Education Office and to play carom board, a national pastime, in a nearby shopfront. Returning to the main street, the demolition of a landmark gate made me reflect on how cities transform, shedding old landmarks for new identities. Navigating narrow alleyways, I felt like a stranger in my own hometown. Multistory buildings have emerged and roads have been paved, reshaping the town. It’s the same place with a different face, leaving me nostalgic for the Phidim of my memories.We finally reached Shivalaya temple, which I told my wife and daughter was one of my cherished hangouts. A giant statue of Falgunanda (the Kirant leader’s birthday is celebrated on November 10) stood before the steps to the temple. Though my wife suspected I came here to smoke, in reality, I visited the temple in the evening to meet friends and talk about issues that mattered most to us at the time. It also offered a panoramic view of the town (I could not take my family to Gadhi Danda, a hillock across the Shivalaya).Towards the end of my journey, I felt sad about Phidim’s lack of prospects. To my dismay, I found that people have been leaving the town in droves. Despite blacktopped roads and multi-story buildings, Phidim faces a troubling reality. The lack of quality higher education and specialist healthcare has driven people away, echoing the circumstances that led me to Kathmandu years ago. Conversations with locals confirmed a mass exodus from the town, a trend that raises concerns about Phidim's future.My conversations with familiar strangers led me to conclude that Phidim has transformed into a transit town for pilgrims heading to Pathibhara Devi Temple, which is around 255 kilometres north in Taplejung district. I met dozens of people headed to the holy site. While pilgrims see it as a stopover, for me, it was a homecoming. The realisation dawned that Phidim is, perhaps, in a state of transition, trading its rustic charm for the hallmarks of urbanisation. While I left Phidim for higher education in Kathmandu, people from rural areas have flocked to the town in search of better opportunities, bringing life and energy to the once quiet community.As we bid adieu to my hometown, I couldn’t help but reflect on the inevitability of leaving a place, no matter how enamoured one is with it. Passing Kanchhi Dokan, I pointed out Kanchnajungha and Kumbhakarna to my daughter—symbols of my childhood. Phidim, now a blend of nostalgia and change, remains etched in my heart, a testament to the intricate dance between memory and evolution. \nNepal Police Club defeated Karnali Province 3-0 to preserve their unbeaten run in the ANFA Women’s League at the ANFA Complex in Lalitpur on Wednesday.Nirmala Upadhyaya, Manisha Raut and Samjhana Lawati scored for Police, who have already qualified for the Super League.The victory against already eliminated Karnali also ensured Police at least a third-placed finish in the ten-ten standings. Police have 18 points from eight matches with five wins and three draws.Karnali are in the ninth position.Defending champions Armed Police Force lead the standings with 22 points and are the only other team to have preserved their unbeaten run after eight rounds.Tribhuvan Army Club occupy the second position with 19 points.The top five teams at the end of single round robin league progress to the Super League, which will be played in a double round robin format. The top four teams at the end of the Super League will play Qualifiers, Eliminator and final.At Satdobato, Police went in front in the 44th minute through Upadhyaya’s tight angle effort after Karnali players failed to clear Ghim Kumari Gurung’s corner. Raut doubled Police’s lead ten minutes into the second half, taking advantage of a howler from Karnali goalkeeper Lila Joshi. The goalie failed to properly grab an easy free kick from Gurung allowing Raut to seize possession of the ball and slam into the back of the net.Lawati added the third in the 82nd minute from another set piece, sending home a rebound after Raut’s free kick hit the crossbar.The remaining two spots for the Super League will be decided in the final round, with fourth-placed Waling Municipality (12 points) and fifth-placed Koshi Province (11 points) in the main fray.Bagmati Youth Club (10 points), Sankata (eight points) and Chandrapur Municipality (eight points) also have slim chances but they could find themselves eliminated without playing their final first round match if Waling beat Chandrapur and Koshi win against bottom-placed Sudurpaschim on Thursday.Even if Waling vs Chandrapur and Koshi vs Sudurpaschim results go other way—which is very unlikely because Chandrapur are struggling with just one victory and winless Sudurpaschim being the easiest target—Bagmati must get past challenge from a relentless APF to progress.Sankata’s hopes hang on a thin rope as they must beat Police and hope Koshi falter against Sudurpaschim. \nNepal ended their Canada Tri-series of the ICC Men’s Cricket World Cup League 2 without a victory after their last match of the series was abandoned without a ball bowled due to rain.The no result gave Nepal their first point of the League 2 following a five-match losing streak that stretched back to February.Nepal have lost six of their eight matches and sit in the seventh position in the eight-team standing with three points. Their only victory of the second edition of the League 2 came in the inaugural tri-series at the TU Cricket Ground when they thrashed the Netherlands by nine wickets. Rohit Paudel’s Nepal lost twice against Namibia and the second leg against the Dutch in the home tri-series. In Canada, they lost the series opener against the hosts by 103 runs and faced a one-wicket defeat against Oman in the second match. Nepal also lost to Canada in the third match of the series by five wickets.Canada lead the standings with 14 points with seven wins and four losses. Oman are sixth with six points. Their match against Scotland had also yielded no result.Nepal next play a T20I tri-series against the same sides (Canada and Oman) before heading to the United States to participate in the US Tri-Series, which also involves Scotland.US are second with 12 points. They have six victories and two losses.Scotland are fourth on nine points with four wins and two losses. \nChandra Bhandari scored a hat-trick as Tribhuvan Army Club defeated Waling Municipality 8-0 at the ANFA Complex in Lalitpur on Tuesday that guaranteed them at least second position in the ANFA Women’s League.Bimala BK and Amisha Karki scored a brace in their dominant display at Satdobato that gave Army 19 points from eight matches.Army have already qualified for the Super League and will now aim to dethrone defending champions and leaders Armed Police Force Club from the top of the ten team standings when they take on already-eliminated Karnali Province in their final league match on Friday.APF have 22 points and can progress to the Super League as table toppers if they defeat or draw against Bagmati Youth Club in their last first round match, also scheduled for Friday.Bagmati beat Sankata 3-1 in the day’s other action to climb to sixth position that also boosted their hopes to reach the second round. However, they face a formidable challenge in their next fixture against a relentless APF.Nepal Police Club, who have two games in hand, have also qualified for the second round with 15 points.Despite the defeat, Waling occupy the fourth spot with 12 points and can ensure a top-five finish with a victory against Chandrapur on Thursday.Koshi are fifth with a game in hand and are the most favoured side to progress because they have an easy match-up against tournament’s weakest side Supurpaschim, who are still winless and sit at the bottom. For Sankata, Tuesday’s defeat against Bagmati is a big blow to their hopes of advancing to the next round. They must defeat Police and hope Koshi falter against Sudurpaschim to stand any chance of progressing. Army are one of the strongest and clinical sides in the league and on Tuesday, they showed their intent for their maiden women’s league title, handing Waling their biggest defeat of the season.Army went in front in the 38th minute when Waling goalkeeper Sanjina Majhi failed to make a routine save, allowing BK’s long-ranged strike to slip into the net.Bhandari doubled Army’s lead in the 43rd minute, sending a low shot past advancing Majhi after Karki set her up.Army went into the break 3-0 up, courtesy of an own goal from Fatumah Nakasumba, who put a corner from Hima Chaudhary into her own post.Bhandari furthered Army’s lead in the 54th minute following a well-coordinated team effort, which was followed by Karki’s two goals in the 62nd and 71st minute, both assisted by Dipa Shahi.Bhandari completed her hat-trick three minutes later, converting a pass from substitute Dikshya Gurung.BK then netted her second and Army’s eighth goal in the 90th with a stunning long-range effort.Sankata were looking to cap a dream season by reaching the second round in their league debut but Gifty Acheampong’s double and a late goal from Pushpa Kumari Khadka left them in the seventh position, three behind fifth-placed Koshi.Senegalese Acheampong gave Bagmati the lead in the 68th minute with a brilliant volley and furthered the lead in the 76th minute with a solo effort.Temilope Jeniffer Owoeye reduced the deficit in the 83rd minute with a powerful shot after Mamata Pun put her through.Bagmati should have extended the lead to 3-0 when they were awarded a penalty in the first minute of stoppage time but their captain Divya Yasmali Magar missed it.But Khadka put the result beyond doubt in dying seconds tapping in a cross from Gifty. \nDefending champions Armed Police Force Club demolished Sudurpaschim Province 19-0 in the most lopsided win of the ANFA Women’s League at the ANFA Complex on Monday.Rashmi Kumari Ghising and Anita KC scored four goals each, while Preeti Rai netted a hat-trick for APF. Sabita Rana Magar and Kusum Khatiwada were at the double; and Anita Basnet, Saru Limbu and Renuka Hamal also found the net. APF’s one came from an own goal from Sudurpaschim’s Sumi Hangma Rai.The win also helped APF open up a six-point lead at the summit of the ten-team standings. APF have 22 points from eight matches. APF are also the team to score the highest number of goals in the league this season, with 46 goals to their name. They have conceded only two.APF’s 19-0 victory against Sudurpaschim is the biggest victory of the season so far. The previous biggest victory of the season was Army 14-0 success, also against Sudurpaschim.Winless Sudurpaschim have now conceded 65 goals in eight matches against their three goals scored (one each against Army, Waling and Bagmati Youth Club).They were also embarrassed 9-0 by Nepal Police Club, while their lowest margin loss came against Karnali Province when they suffered a 3-0 defeat.APF knew Sudurpaschim were the easiest target and took full advantage of it to go 11-0 up at half-time, with their three goals coming in the injury time. Their first-half goal rush also included an own goal from Rai in the 39th minute.Anita KC completed her hat-trick in the first half—her two goals came in the 45+2 and 45+3 minutes—and found her fourth goal in the 76th minute.Ghising, whose opening goal in the 8th minute opened the floodgates, accomplished a hat-trick two minutes into the second half and netted her fourth in the 76 minute. Ghising now leads the goal scoring chart with 13 goals.Waling Municipality’s Uganda forward Jackline Nassali is second in the list with seven goals.Preeti Rai, who found her first goal in the fourth minute of the first half injury time scored two freekicks in the 64th and 67th minute in a carbon copy fashion.Anita Basnet, Sabita Rana Magar and Saru Limbu all got on the scoresheet before the break.Kusum Khatiwada, who replaced Saru Limbu in the second half , scored twice in the 82nd minute and 86th minute, while Renuka Hamal also got on the score sheet in the 90th minute.Earlier, Chandrapur Municipality and Koshi Province shared points after playing a 1-1 draw, also at the ANFA Complex.Sunita Sunar put Chandrapur ahead in the 51st minute but Mamata Raut equalised in the 80th minute to snatch a draw for Koshi.The draw moved Chandrapur up to seventh position with eight points. Koshi stayed in fifth position with 11 points. \nPrime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra and her predecessor Srettha Thavisin both posted social media comments applauding the long-awaited enactment of the Marriage Equality Bill after it received royal endorsement.The landmark legislation, published in the Royal Gazette on Tuesday evening, grants same-sex couples the same legal rights and protections as heterosexual couples.A 120-day moratorium has been implemented to allow for necessary legal adjustments, meaning the law will come into force on January 22, 2025.On Tuesday, Paetongtarn posted on the X platform: “For every love… Congratulations to everyone’s love. #LoveWins”She went on to thank all parties for pushing for the bill, adding that it is a joint battle for everyone. The PM then retweeted an X post from Srettha:“Another important step for Thai society: The Equal Marriage Bill has passed! Equality and fairness are now tangible in Thailand, and gender diversity will finally be fully accepted. Congratulations!”The law, a culmination of two decades of efforts by activists and political parties, was approved by the Senate in June.Its final stamp of approval makes Thailand the first country in Southeast Asia and the third in Asia to recognise same-sex marriages.“The family institution is a vital unit for social development and enhancing citizen’s quality of life. However, the establishment of a family under the Civil and Commercial Code is limited to relationships between a man and a woman, which does not align with the current society where individuals of diverse genders can coexist as families, providing care and support for one another in ways that are no different from marriages between men and women,” an explanation of the law published in the Royal Gazette read.“It is suitable to amend certain provisions in the Civil and Commercial Code to allow individuals of diverse genders to engage in engagement and marriage, which will grant them equal rights, duties, and family status as couples consisting of a man and a woman. This aims to strengthen families formed between individuals of any gender. It is therefore necessary to enact this law, except on matters where other laws already address specific family or inheritance issues.”- In association with the Asia News Network \nIsraeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz on Thursday rejected proposals for a ceasefire with Hezbollah after the United States and France called for a 21-day halt in the fighting that has alarmed Lebanon and raised fears of a ground invasion.“here will be no ceasefire in the north. We will continue to fight against the Hezbollah terrorist organization with all our strength until victory and the safe return of the residents of the north to their homes,” he said in a statement on the social media platform X.He dashed hopes for a peaceful settlement after Lebanese Prime Minister Najib Mikati had expressed hope that a ceasefire could be reached soon.The United States, France and several allies called for the immediate 21-day ceasefire across the Israel-Lebanon border while also expressing support for a ceasefire in Gaza following intense discussions at the United Nations on Wednesday.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, heading to New York to address the United Nations, said he had not yet given his response to the truce proposal and had instructed the army to fight on. Hardliners in his government said Israel should reject the truce and keep hitting Hezbollah.Meanwhile, there was no let-up in violence. Israeli airstrikes overnight hit around 75 Hezbollah targets in the Bekaa Valley and southern Lebanon, including weapons storage facilities and ready-to-fire launchers, the Israeli military said on Thursday.In the latest deadly strike, at least 23 Syrians, most of them women and children, were killed when Israel hit a three-story building in the Lebanese town of Younine overnight, the town’s mayor, Ali Qusas, told Reuters. Lebanon is home to around 1.5 million Syrians who fled civil war there.The Israeli military said dozens of Hezbollah targets were attacked, including terrorists, military buildings and weapons depots, in several areas on Thursday morning.Around 45 projectiles were fired from Lebanon towards the western Galilee area, some of which were intercepted with the rest falling on open ground, said the Israeli military.Netanyahu repeated pledges to ensure that tens of thousands of Israelis evacuated from northern border areas can return home. Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, who heads one of two nationalist-religious factions in the governing coalition, said Hezbollah should be crushed and that only its surrender would make it possible for the evacuees to return.Mikati welcomed the call for a truce but said the key to its implementation was whether Israel, which has been moving troops closer to Lebanon, is committed to enforcing international resolutions.Asked if a ceasefire could be secured soon, Mikati told Reuters: “Hopefully, yes.”Mikati’s caretaker administration includes ministers chosen by Hezbollah, widely seen as the country’s most powerful political force. \nTrade unions will lead protests across Spain on Thursday in an effort to force an agreement between the government and the business sector over a reduction in working hours amid pushback from employers concerned about a rise in costs.Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez’s Socialists are seeking to persuade businesses to buy into a plan to reduce the working week by 2.5 hours from 40 hours that they say will boost productivity.The European Union must close the productivity gap between its member states to keep pace with economic rivals the United States and China, former European Central Bank chief Mario Draghi said in a report this month produced for the European Commission.To secure the backing of employers, the government has offered a hiring bonus for small businesses with less than 10 employees to offset the reduction in working hours while maintaining the same level of service, according to a source involved in the negotiations.Madrid can approve the reduction without consensus and a senior government source said they will do so before the end of 2024.The offer calculates the working week on an annual basis, so workers in sectors where it is difficult to adapt shifts such as hospitality can accrue hours that can later be compensated for in the form of holidays.Spaniards work more hours than most Europeans. According to Eurostat, the average working week in Spain was 36.4 hours in 2023, compared to the European Union average of 36.1 hours.Labour Minister Yolanda Diaz has said that reducing working hours will increase productivity, an area where Spain has traditionally lagged behind its European counterparts.Business owners fear the proposal will mean employees work fewer hours for the same pay as before.The impact of similar measures in other countries is unclear.France in 2000 introduced a 35-hour work week expecting it would create hundreds of thousands of jobs. But data shows an increase in the cost of labour, making French workers more expensive in relative terms and companies less competitive. \nThe United States, France and several allies called for an immediate 21-day ceasefire across the Israel-Lebanon border while also expressing support for a ceasefire in Gaza following intense discussions at the United Nations on Wednesday.The ceasefire would apply to the Israel-Lebanon “Blue Line,” the demarcation line between Lebanon and Israel, and would allow the parties to negotiate towards a potential diplomatic resolution of the conflict, a senior Biden administration official said.“We call on all parties, including the governments of Israel and Lebanon, to endorse the temporary ceasefire immediately,” according to a joint statement of the countries released by the White House.The allies that signed the joint statement included Australia, United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia and the European Union.Israel widened its airstrikes in Lebanon on Wednesday and at least 72 people were killed, according to a Reuters compilation of Lebanese health ministry statements. The ministry earlier said at least 223 were wounded.Israel’s military chief said a ground assault was possible, raising fears the conflict could spark a wider Middle East war.Over the last several months, Washington has been engaging with officials in Israel and Lebanon to reduce hostilities, the senior White House official said.“We have had those discussions for quite some time,” the official said, adding Washington and its allies were aiming to convert those discussions into a broader agreement during this 21-day ceasefire period.The official said Biden had been focused on the possibility of a ceasefire “in almost every conversation he had with world leaders” at the United Nations General Assembly this week.Based on discussions with Israelis and Lebanese, the US and its allies felt this was the right time for a call for a ceasefire, the official added.Israel’s UN Ambassador Danny Danon told reporters before a UN Security Council meeting on Wednesday that Israel would welcome a ceasefire and preferred a diplomatic solution. He then told the Security Council that Iran was the nexus of violence in the region and peace required dismantling the threat.Iran’s Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi told reporters before the council meeting that his country supported Hezbollah and would not remain indifferent if the conflict in Lebanon spiraled.Lebanese Prime Minister Najib Mikati called on the Security Council to put pressure on Israel for “an immediate ceasefire on all fronts.” Asked if a ceasefire can be reached soon, he told Reuters: “Hopefully, yes.”World leaders voiced concern that the conflict - running in parallel to Israel’s war in Gaza against Palestinian Hamas militants also backed by Iran - was escalating rapidly as the death toll rose in Lebanon and thousands fled their homes.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was due to arrive in New York on Thursday and address the UN General Assembly on Friday.LEBANON CONFLICT PUTS PRESSURE ON BIDEN, HARRISThe US administration has for nearly a year sought unsuccessfully to secure a ceasefire in Gaza.The conflict has been costly politically for US President Joe Biden and by extension Vice President Kamala Harris’ presidential campaign with the violence in Lebanon increasing pressure on his administration to find a diplomatic solution.Earlier on Wednesday Israel shot down a missile that the Iranian-backed Hezbollah movement said it had aimed at the headquarters of the Mossad intelligence agency near Israel’s biggest city, Tel Aviv.Israeli officials said a heavy missile had headed towards civilian areas in Tel Aviv, not the Mossad HQ, before being shot down.“You hear the jets overhead; we have been striking all day,” General Herzi Halevi told Israeli troops on the border with Lebanon, according to a military statement.“This is both to prepare the ground for your possible entry and to continue degrading Hezbollah.” A Pentagon spokesperson said an Israeli ground incursion did not appear imminent.As many as half a million people may have been displaced in Lebanon, its foreign minister said. In Beirut, thousands of people displaced from southern Lebanon were sheltering in schools and other buildings.ISRAELI AIRSTRIKES TARGET HEZBOLLAH LEADERSIsraeli airstrikes this week have targeted Hezbollah leaders and hit hundreds of sites deep inside Lebanon, where hundreds of thousands have fled the border region, while the group has fired barrages of rockets into Israel.Mourners thronged a funeral on Wednesday in Beirut’s suburbs for two senior Hezbollah commanders killed in Israeli strikes the day before. Fighters in fatigues carried the flag-covered coffins as a band played. The crowd chanted Hezbollah slogans and some wept.Israel said its warplanes were hitting south Lebanon and the Bekaa Valley, a Hezbollah stronghold further north, and that it was calling up two more reserve brigades for operations on Israel’s northern border.In a video message that made no comment on diplomatic efforts to secure a ceasefire, Netanyahu said Hezbollah was being hit harder than it could ever have imagined.Israel has made a priority of securing its northern border and allowing the return there of some 70,000 residents displaced by near-daily exchanges of fire since war broke out in October between Israel and Hamas in Gaza on Israel’s southern border.Lebanese hospitals have filled with the wounded since Monday, when Israeli bombing killed more than 550 people in Lebanon’s deadliest day since its civil war ended in 1990. \nIn 2008 Matina Shakya was only three years old when she was appointed as the Kumari of Kathmandu. She was succeeded by Trishna Shakya as the new Kumari in 2017.Kumaris are revered as goddesses of beauty and strength in certain Hindu and Buddhist traditions. Worshipping young girls as Kumaris is a 2,000-year-old practice in Nepal. Since the 13th century, when the Malla kings ruled, the Newars of the Kathmandu Valley have been worshipping Kumari, a girl from the Shakya/Bajracharya community chosen to embody the divine energy of goddess Taleju Bhawani. The reign of a Kumari ends when she starts menstruating. So long as she is serving as the Kumari, she is believed to be the nation’s divine protector, safeguarding it from evil. Matina, 18, is now in her first year of college, studying for a bachelor’s degree in management. Her father, Pratapman Shakya, when asked about having a daughter who is the only living the goddess in the world said, “Not having your own daughter live in the same house as you seemed a little unfair, but we feel very proud to call ourselves the parents of the royal Kumari who is revered by people all over the world.”On March 9, 2023, he, along with Matina, were getting ready for a special function held to honour all former Kumaris from across Nepal. “There are often events to honour Matina as she was the royal Kumari, but this one was dedicated to all former Kumaris from different areas. There are 129 living Kumaris in all,” he added. Besides Kathmandu, Kumari tradition is followed in Bhaktapur, Lalitpur, and Kirtipur, among other cities.According to him, this was the first time an event like this was organised and the Deputy Mayor of Kathmandu, Sunita Dangol, was also in attendance.Throughout the year, many people line up outside the ‘Kumari Ghar’ to get a chance to visit the Kumari and get her blessings. Many foreigners stand out in the yard to catch a glimpse of her. Nepali people believe that if a Kumari smiles at you, it is a bad omen.Everyday, a tutor visits the Kumari to help her continue with her education as she is not allowed to step outside the Kumari Ghar. She takes her exams and does her homework from the Kumari Ghar itself. She also has the freedom to play inside the Kumari Ghar. Many former kumaris have pursued careers in their fields of interest or studied after their term ends, and they continue to be treated with the same respect. The tradition of Kumari has evolved over time. In the past Kumaris did not enjoy these freedoms.Because of various superstitious beliefs, Kumaris were not fully educated and were forbidden from getting married because of the belief that the groom would die soon if he married an ex-Kumari. They led secluded lives, were restricted from participating in normal childhood activities, and focused solely on their religious duties.However, now, these myths have been dispelled. Modern understanding has shifted to recognise that Kumaris, after stepping down from their divine role, have the freedom to marry and lead a normal life. The perception of Kumaris as isolated figures has evolved, with a focus on providing them with a more balanced upbringing. There have been initiatives to integrate Kumaris into regular social and educational settings, allowing them to have a more holistic and fulfilling childhood experience. “Matina was already familiar with the students from the school that she attended after her term as Kumari ended,” said Shakya. “The kids visited the Kumari Ghar frequently so that she could have a smooth transition,” he added. According to Gautam Prasad Shakya, who has been living as a caretaker in the Kumari Ghar, the changes made to the tradition are minor. “The traditions of Kumari have mostly stayed the same. All the rituals are still practised like in the old days,” he said.On 6 May 2005, Pun Devi Maharjan, a lawyer, filed a case in the Supreme Court claiming that the traditional practice of electing young girls as Kumaris, or “goddesses’, who are expected to follow certain social restrictions and appear at religious festivals, violated the rights of the child. Quoting Maharjan’s complaint, Puskar Mathema writes in Yuwamanch Monthly of October 2007, “If Kumari tradition is continued, it will undermine the fundamental rights as well the freedoms of children guaranteed by the constitution and child rights treaties. Apart from this, it will have a negative impact on their physical and mental development.”The case continued while Nepal overthrew the monarchy and declared itself a secular state in 2007. When the judgement was pronounced in 2008, the goddess was still in her role, now giving blessings to the country’s President. The court ordered that the Kumaris and ex-Kumaris receive better benefits and arrangements and ordered the government to improve their support and allowances.In April 2006, Prof Chunda Bajracharya filed a petition at the Supreme Court against Maharjan’s petition, who had argued against the Kumari tradition. Bajracharya contended that the tradition should be preserved as heritage due to its over 100 years of history.“People who don’t understand the culture shouldn’t comment on it,” she stated. Bajracharya also criticised the human right activists who contended that Kumaris were only allowed to wear the colour red. “People who say Kumaris are forced to wear red clothing all the time, are the same people who send their kids to schools in uniform,” she said.“After the 2008 court verdict, there have been a lot of improvements. Now, a teacher visits the Kumari Ghar daily to tutor the Kumari, who is expected to complete school assignments and sit periodic exams. All the former Kumaris now get benefits like scholarships and special pensions,” she added.Bajracharya is currently a professor of literature at the Tribhuvan University in Kathmandu.“The only significant change that the court verdict brought to the tradition was in terms of her education,” said Gautam Prasad Shakya, the caretaker. “Kumaris were tutored long before the case, but the case helped formalise this arrangement. After the court verdict, the time between 12 pm and 4 pm was designated as the Kumari’s tuition time,” he added.After the verdict, there was a concerted effort to provide Kumaris with access to quality education, enabling them to develop the skills and knowledge needed to lead fulfilling lives beyond their divine roles. There was also a shift towards ensuring that the Kumari's living quarters are comfortable, safe, and conducive to her overall well-being.Moreover, the selection process for the Kumari underwent reforms in the aftermath of the Pun Devi Maharjan case. There was a push for greater transparency, accountability, and inclusivity in the selection of the Kumari, with an emphasis on ensuring that the process was fair, respectful, and free from undue influence.Efforts were made to support their transition into adulthood, including providing them with comprehensive resources for education, vocation, and social integration. This shift aimed to address the challenges faced by former Kumaris and empower them to lead independent and fulfilling lives after their divine service.“The Kumari tradition has evolved over time. During the tenure of my daughter, we saw a lot of improvements. Even after her time as Kumari, Matina continued to get a lot of government support,” said Shakya, former Kumari Matina’s father.“Some people argue that child rights are being violated, but all of her rights are being upheld inside the Kumari Ghar. This is a unique and respected aspect of Nepali culture, and I don’t believe it violates any of my child’s rights.”While the Kumari tradition continues, its practices have evolved. “She enjoys this normal life and it didn’t take her long to adjust as well,” says Matina’s father, on her transition from the revered Kumari to the ordinary Matina. \nWhat animals did Juddha Shumsher have in his zoo?“We only have records of animals from the mid-1960s,” says Ganesh Koirala, who has been employed at the Central Zoo for the past 36 years and currently serves as its information officer and programme officer. “That too I hand-copied from an old torn-down file that I came across.”Today, the Central Zoo, which sprawls across six hectares in Jawalakhel, Lalitpur, houses as many as 1,298 wild animals of different species of mammals, reptiles, fishes and birds from Nepal and around the world—from tiger, rhinoceros, hippopotamus and red panda to its recent attraction: a pair of chimpanzees.After enduring decades of neglect under various government bodies, with its animals and infrastructure scraping along in a deplorable state, the zoo received a new lease of life with improved infrastructure and animal care in 1995, when it came under the management of the King Mahendra Trust for Nature Conservation (KMTNC), now known as the National Trust for Nature Conservation, in 1995.Today, the Central Zoo is an entertainment venue, one of the most happening places in the Kathmandu valley. Flocked by thousands of daily visitors, the zoo now also hosts rescued animals and those in need of rehabilitation. It is also a site for conservation education.But when Juddha Shumsher Rana (prime minister from 1932–1945) built the Jawalakhel Zoological Garden on the premises of his Jawalakhel Durbar (where Nepal Administrative Staff College stands today) in 1932, he did so purely for private interests—as a space of entertainment and amusement for him and his family.Built in the semi-wilderness of Jawalakhel around a historical pond dating to the 17th century during the reign of King Siddhi Narsingh Malla, the zoo also became the space he could use to show his respect for two women he revered, his mother and sister-in-law, and indulge in one of his favourite pastimes—gambling.Today, the Central Zoo, nestled in the heart of Jawalakhel's sprawling crowd, does not go unnoticed, and its story is well told. But what passions drove Juddha to build the zoo? What was its original layout? What animals did it have in the beginning? And how did Juddha spend time there?“I remember once seeing a small board that read ‘Jawalakhel Zoological Garden’,” Koirala says. “I don’t know whether it was from Juddha’s time or was made in the later years. It must surely be that Juddha built the zoo out of influence from the British given how this term was used by them.”Koirala adds, “There is a former employee, now an elderly gentleman who worked in the zoo in the 1960s. He surely has some stories from Juddha’s time.”Birds, beasts and palacesTo trace the birth of Jawalakhel Zoological Garden, one has to look at the history of Nepal’s rulers owning birds and animals.Like rulers around the world, Nepal’s royalty kept wild and exotic birds and animals in captivity as a source of pleasure and mark of wealth and power. The book ‘Social History of Nepal’ by historians TR Vaidya, Tri Ratna Manandhar and Shankar Lal Joshi details how Mallas during the mediaeval Kathmandu Valley to Ranas and Shahs in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries owned rare, exotic creatures. In 1708, a rhinoceros in Kathmandu Valley broke the iron chain in which it was bound and killed its tamer. In 1714, Bhaktapur’s King Bhupatindra Malla gifted a camel and an elephant to Kantipur’s King Bhaskar Malla to build peace.Among Shahs, King Rana Bahadur Shah in particular was reputed for his collection of birds and animals. He also owned a zoo outside his palace in Basantapur Durbar Square, where the Nepal Bank Limited stands in New Road today. The zoo contained “tiger, bear, monkey, elephant, horse, deer… heron, peacock… pigeon, wild dogs, rabbits, rats, mongoose.”Jung Bahadur Rana’s zoo on the premises of his Thapathali Durbar hosted a variety of birds and animals collected during his hunting expeditions as well as those brought from abroad. Jung Bahadur himself used to “supervise and inspect it”. Juddha Shumsher likewise had his own collection of creatures which steadily expanded into a zoological garden. Seeking wilderness in his Jawalakhel DurbarJuddha’s biographer Ishwari Prasad writes in ‘The Life and Times of Maharaja Juddha Shumsher Jung Bahadur Rana’ that between 1933 and 1940, Juddha shot 433 tigers, 33 rhinoceros and 93 leopards. An insatiable big-game hunter, Juddha had a deep fondness for being in the wild and among wild animals, and from this came, according to oral history prevalent among members of Kathmandu’s Rana community including Juddha’s descendants, the desire to own a zoo.Built in 1752, Schönbrunn Zoo in Vienna, the world’s first modern zoo, was already over 100 years old when Juddha was born in 1875. London Zoo opened in 1828 and Alipore Zoological Garden (Kolkata Zoo) in 1875. Nawab Wajid Ali Shah Zoological Garden (Lucknow Zoo) was established in 1921. Juddha’s inspiration, his descendants say, was most likely reinforced by his tours to zoological gardens during his visits to England in 1908 and to different Indian cities.An article titled ‘Central zoo in state of neglect’ published in The Kathmandu Post in 1996 says that Juddha one day “received a pair of leopards as a gift”, cementing his desire to own a zoo. A report ‘Central Zoo Master Plan’ prepared by the KMTNC in 1996 says that Juddha decided to build a zoo in an epiphany when he saw that some animals “including deer, a few rhinos, and some tigers had been collected from the Tarai and kept in Kathmandu” could be put into one compound in the “lonely piece of land with a large 16th [sic] century Malla period Pokhari”.The pond lay still and serene surrounded by green wilderness ever since Patan’s King Siddhi Narsingh Malla built it in the 1600s. On the grounds surrounding this pond, the Newars from Na:Tole, Pulchowk and surroundings had their devisthans where, for centuries, they gathered to perform their religious ceremonies during Basanta Panchami and Bhoto Jatra even after this area fell within the Jawalakhel Durbar.For the palace, the ground served as its extended garden along with a horse and elephant stable. Subodh Rana, 69, grandson of Juddha Shumsher, recalled his father Kiran Shumsher telling him that Juddha and his family sometimes also used the scenic grounds for picnics. If there was any spot where Juddha wanted to build a menagerie, it would be around this Pokhari (pond). One day, he called his grandson General Maheshwar Shumsher Rana and deputed him to the task of doing just this.The zoo’s layout—except for the small plots of lands acquired later—that was in place when it came under KMTNC's management was, the present and retired zoo officials believe, mostly the same as it was built by Maheshwar and so offers a peek into how Juddha’s zoo must have been like. Pond in the middle of the ground surrounded by enclosures—the southern bank housing mainly larger animals, and cages for birds positioned on the northern banks.From pigeons to the king of the jungleWhat animals and birds did the enclosures at Juddha’s zoo house?“We cannot tell for sure,” Koirala says.Once it came under government ownership, the zoo was tossed from one institution to the other for lack of interest and knowledge on the right institution to manage it. Amid all this chaos, documents were possibly lost and the zoo has no concrete record about the animals that Juddha must have once taken amusement at, said Koirala.Mukti Narayan Shrestha, 82, a retired secretary of the Nepal government, joined the Central Zoo in 1970 as a veterinarian when many original structures of the zoo were still intact. Shrestha also worked with an elderly khardar who, he says, was employed in the zoo since the time of Juddha and was about to retire when he joined.“In those days where the purpose of menageries was exclusively for exhibition and pleasure with no regard for the welfare and recreation of animals and birds, the cages were tiny and iron-barred,” Shrestha says.Elephant, horses, deer, monkeys, tiger, rhinoceros, clouded leopard, red panda, bear, palm civet (nir biralo), four-horned antelope, Himalayan goral, pheasants, Himalayan monal—from the mythical and the majestic, the gentle and friendly to the fiery and ferocious, Juddha’s zoo boasted them all, Shrestha says.Shrestha’s account is not different from the anecdotes passed down to other retired and present zoo officials and the members of the Rana community, who also detail the rare and the exotic fauna, like the gharial crocodile and porcupine, even the jungle’s king—creatures, they say, that Juddha must have received from foreigners as gifts—appearing alongside domestic birds like pigeons.Tidbits of published information also confirm that the zoo had a good collection of exotic birds and animals from Nepal and abroad. One such suggestion comes from Kalyan Shumsher’s ‘Shree Teen Juddha Mahima’ published during Juddha’s reign in 1943.“One need not travel abroad to see the incredible birds and animals found in foreign countries,” he writes. “It will suffice to see [those creatures] right here in the zoo opened by His Holiness Shree 3 [Juddha] in Jawalakhel.”Among these incredible creatures, one reigned supreme—lion, the king of the jungle.For one, it would not have satiated Juddha to build a zoo and not have the jungle’s king exhibited in it. Juddha hence must have done everything possible to ensure one for the zoo. Infrastructure at the zoo suggests that the lion indeed lived at Juddha’s zoo or, in the least, during the Rana regime.“Where bear habitat lies today, there were two dome-shaped attached enclosures with a holding room, constructed in the classic architecture that many enclosures in the British zoos had in the past. They had brick walls and lime plaster,” Koirala says. “These were built to house a lion in one cage and a tiger in the other.”Near these enclosures stood another cage that remains intact today, with the head of a roaring lion carved out of the wall on the top of its iron bars. Zoo officials as well as members of the Rana community believe that Juddha had this exhibit built to specifically house a lion.Remarkably, these Juddha-era infrastructural spaces are corroborated by a rare piece of photographic evidence. A 1946 photo of the zoo shows a lion while a Kathmandu mother and her sons stand in front of its cage.Juddha’s place of piety and playThe zoo was not merely a space that Juddha sought out for amusement and retreat in the outpost of his palace; he also used this place to express his deepest affection.This affection spills right at the zoo’s entrance, in the form of the life-size statue of Karma Kumari Devi, wife of Juddha’s elder brother and Rana Prime Minister Dev Shumsher. Karma Kumari stands tall in her regal costume shaded by a wide canopy. Juddha revered Karma Kumari because it was she who raised him and looked after his mother Juhar Kumari Devi after the death of his father Dhir Shumsher. On another prominent part of the zoo on the south-east, Juhar Kumari’s enthroned statue overlooks the pond. Juddha had commissioned the London-based sculptor Domenico Antonio Tonelli to cast these statues.When Karma Kumari’s statue was unveiled is not clear, but Juhar Kumari’s statue was unveiled by Juddha amid a grand function in 1935 on Jawalakhel’s most auspicious day, Bhoto Jatra. It was attended by the British Resident Frederick Bailey.“On June 28, 1935, at Jawalakhel Durbar… the pond nearby looked very scenic,” says a Gorkhapatra news report titled ‘Statue installation’ dated July 5, 1935. “Because it was the day of Bhoto Jatra of Machhindranath… and moreover since an ideal woman’s statue was being unveiled, there was a crowd of lakhs of people.”Less than fifty metres from Karma Kumari’s statue stands a one-story building with a pagoda roof that today serves as the zoo’s meeting hall. Juddha, an avid gambler, found the scenic semi-wilderness covered in trees and filled with the sounds of wildlife to be a perfect place to relish the game. So he built a building with twelve doors on its four sides allowing him and his fellow gambling compatriots the freedom to enter through a particular door that they thought would bring luck. He called it his Juwa Ghar, the gambling house, and built it with the sole purpose of indulging in the game he loved. Roar of lion reverberates in KathmanduThe sounds of the animals and birds in the zoo rose up in the Jawalakhel sky. Every day, until much later in the 1970s, roar of the zoo’s lion (there were later other lions) diffused to far corners of the Valley, merging the zoo with the spirit of Kathmandu and informing the city folks of its presence.But was the zoo open to the public as well?“I think once it was built, the zoo was open for the public,” Subodh Rana said. “It is unlikely that Juddha Shumsher built such a large zoo and kept it only for his family.”For one, Kalyan Shumsher mentioning that one “need not travel abroad to see the incredible birds and animals found in foreign countries” suggests that the public had at least some access to the zoo. Of course, the Newar community from Na:Tole, Pulchowk and surrounding areas were permitted inside the zoo on the days of their guthi functions on Basanta Panchami and Bhoto Jatra.As the zoo was established at the back of the ground where Bhoto Jatra celebrations happen, it naturally filled with revellers on this day in addition to the guthi ritual observers as testified by the Gorkhapatra report. The photo of the mother and her sons also bear testimony that the zoo was not entirely closed to the public.What is widely believed, though, is that the zoo officially came under government ownership after Nepal became a democracy in 1951. And it would still be a few more years before it was open to the public in 1956.In 1945, Juddha gave up his power and eventually retired in Dehradun, India, where he died in 1952. With time, Jawalakhel Zoological Garden became the Central Zoo. It would take many avatars—a neglected site of crammed, unmaintained cages with sad eyes of emaciated creatures staring from behind the bars, a focal point of animal diplomacy, particularly during the period of monarchy, to, in its recent decades, a space of conservation and education.When all this was happening, the city sprawled around Jawalakhel, subduing the lion’s roar with its noise. More wildlife from around the country and the world came—creatures captured from the wild, those sold by circuses, those rescued from traffickers. Fate would bring these creatures to the care of generations of Kathmandu folks, intertwining each other’s joys and sorrows. After the tale of Juddha’s Jawalakhel Zoological Garden, there would be these stories to tell. Sitting around a table inside Juddha’s Juwa Ghar, Koirala and other zoo officials begin unfolding these stories before me. \nNepal’s book market is no stranger to the popular Bangladeshi-Swedish writer Taslima Nasrin. Almost all of her books have been translated into Nepali, but Nasrin herself says that they are all unauthorised translations. “All books [Nepali translations] are pirated versions,” Nasrin told the Post in a Whatsapp conversation. Nasrin, who is currently in exile in India after facing death threats in Bangladesh following the publication of her novel Lajja (Shame), said that she or her publishers have never allowed anyone the right to translate her books into Nepali. “I don’t know of any such Nepali publishers. No one asked for permission and no one has paid [me] royalty.”Translating and publishing books without permission from authors or publishers is a punishable crime. But Nepal’s book market is full of such unauthorised translations and prints of books written by the who’s who of the world literature. Such endeavours haven’t just hurt the authors but also the readers, says Ajit Baral, publisher of the Kathmandu-based Fineprint publication. “These translations are poor,” Baral says. “Tomes with 1200–1300 pages have been trimmed to 200–300 pages. An example is the biography of Bill Clinton.”Another popular book that has seen unauthorised Nepali translation is the biography of Steve Jobs by Walter Isaacson.“We have no official deal in place for a [Nepali] translation of Steve Jobs,” Peppa Mignone, associate agent of the CAA, the translation authority of the biography, said in an email interview with the Post.The book’s Nepali translation is published by Panchpokhari Publication House. The translated book identifies the translator thus: “Achyut Koirala, who has a master’s in English literature, is primarily a journalist. He is currently affiliated with Nagarik daily. He keeps a close tab on international history, politics and culture and has written scripts and dialogues for half a dozen Nepali films. He has published over a dozen non-fiction books.”Koirala, who admits to the unauthorised translation, claims that he hasn’t just translated the book but has also done ‘creative writing’ with it.‘Rich Dad Poor Dad’, written by Robert Kiyosaki and Sharon Lechter, is among the books that’s perennially on the bestseller list across the world. Upon investigation, the Post found three Nepali translations of the book—all unauthorised. One of them is translated by Dilip Kumar Shrestha and published by the same firm, the Panchpokhari Publication House. Another Nepali iteration of the book is published by Book For All publication and translated by Kopila MD. Yet another Nepali version is translated by one Sudheer Dixit and published by Plata Publication, Kathmandu.In an email conversation with the Post, Ronson Taylor, who oversees the international rights at The Rich Dad Company, said, “At this point in time, we do not have a relationship with an established publisher in the [Nepali] language market. If there are any Rich Dad Poor Dad books currently for sale in the Nepali market, they are pirated.”Basanta Thapa, a writer and translator, says that many books are being translated of late to make easy money. “But how would the quality of these unauthorised translations be!” Thapa wonders. “Readers who haven’t read the original wouldn’t know the faults in the translated versions.” Thapa says that any translator worth his salt aims to ‘recreate’ a book and it takes much work to do that.Taslima’s books are the major victimsTaslima’s memoir Uttal Hawa has been translated into Nepali as ‘Sangharsha’, literally Struggle, and is published by Khoji Publication House. Even though the book in its cover claims that it is an authorised translation from the English version Wild Wind, it is a pirated one. The book is translated by Bikash Basnet and edited by Bhogiraj Chamling. A revised version of the book is edited by Sangeet Srota (Yam Bahadur Chhetri).The same publication house has also published the Nepali translation of the book’s sequel as ‘Prem ra Jeevan’. Publisher Sushil Chalise says that while he is aware that one needs to receive permission from the author or the publisher to translate a book, his efforts to contact Taslima were unsuccessful. Therefore, he had published the version the translator made available to him. Translator Basnet, too, admits he translated the book without Taslima’s permission. “About a decade back, we didn’t know how to ask for permission,” he said.Nepal has the Copyright Act (2002) in place. Before it, there was the The Patent, Design and Trade Mark Act, 2022 (1965) that included intellectual property in its 2006 revision. Even the Muluki Ain (Civil Code) of 1910 BS had a provision about copyright. Moreover, it goes without saying that translating somebody else’s work without permission is immoral.Likewise, Indigo Ink Pvt Ltd has published a Nepali translation of Taslima’s anthology of essays No Country for Women as ‘Aaimai ko Kunai Desh Chhaina’. The book is translated by Krishna Giri and edited by Pramod Pradhan. “I have no idea about the agreement between the publisher and translator,” Pradhan, who is also a children’s book writer, says. “I just copy-edited it upon request.”Bishnukumar Poudel, publisher of Indigo Ink, however, claims that he is still trying to take translation rights for the book. “We translated the book long ago,” he says. “We are still trying to get translation rights.”Indigo is also publishing unauthorised translations under its imprints All Book Store Pvt Ltd, Book for All and Plata Publication. It has published two versions of Rich Dad Poor Dad under those shadow imprints. But Plata Publication is not registered in the Company Registrar’s Office.Pradhan says that many foreign books have had unauthorised translations in Nepali and their quality is poor. Those books are translated not from the original language but from a second or third language, so these translations are bound to have problems, he says. “After I learned that those were unauthorised translations, I have stopped editing them,” Pradhan said.Indian author Shiv Khera’s You Can Win has been translated into Nepali by Bloomsbury India and has granted the distribution rights to Ekta Books. But the book’s unauthorised translations are also found in the market and they don’t even mention the name of the publisher and translator. What is interesting is they mention that it’d be illegal to republish the book, or an excerpt of it, without the author’s permission.The Nepali translation of the book, which was poorly written and rife with inaccuracies, had landed the publisher at court. After a complaint was filed at the District Court Kathmandu in 2066BS on the charge that the publisher violated the copyrights and economic rights, the court had issued a verdict on Mangsir 11 that year, charging a fine of Rs10,000, Rs20,000 and Rs30,000 to the defendants Netra Prasad Pokharel, Narayan Prasad Bhusal, and Bhagwati Risal and Bishnu Silwal, respectively.Baral, the Fineprint publisher, says that international publishers wouldn’t demand much for translation rights given Nepal’s small market, but Nepali publishers do not bother to reach out to them. “Publishers who put out unauthorised translations and sell them at 50 percent discount have troubled publishers like us,” he said.Fineprint has published authorised translated versions of books such as Leaving Microsoft to Change the World by John Wood, Healed by Manisha Koirala, and Hippie by Paulo Coelho. The publication house is also set to release the Nepali translation of Israeli historian Yuval Noah Harari’s bestseller Sapiens. Translated into Nepali by Dinesh Kafle, the book’s translation right was acquired at the cost of USD1300, Baral said. Likewise, the publication acquired the translation rights of Sadhguru’s Inner Engineering at IRS93,000, he added.Baral says that publication of unauthorised translations is an immoral and illegal work. “This phenomenon not just hampers Nepal’s fledgling book publishing industry but also tarnishes the country’s reputation in the global market,” Baral said.Thapa, the writer and translator, points out the lack of regulatory mechanisms in the country. “We don’t have an agency that regulates the quality of translations being done,” he says. “Nobody compares the translation with the original. We need a dedicated authority to enhance the quality of translation.” Universities, Nepal Academy and other stakeholders can play a role to uplift the translation sector, he adds.One’s pain, another’s pleasureWhen the author Suketu Mehta was travelling through Mumbai, a young man approached him with a handful of books while his vehicle was stuck in traffic. Brandishing Maximum City, written by none other than Mehta himself, the young man requested the author to buy a copy. Suketu leafed through the book and said, “This is a pirated copy and I’m the author of this book.” The youth wasn’t bothered and replied, “Okay, you can buy it at a discount.”This anecdote was shared to the Post by Mehta’s friend, the author and professor Amitava Kumar, in an email exchange.Most of these pirated books are imported into Nepal from India while the retailers of original books are finding themselves increasingly in trouble. “We sell original copies but many readers doubt us as well, given the ubiquity of pirated versions,” says Anjan Shrestha, operator of Education Book House, Jamal.Ramchandra Timothy, chair of Thapathali-based Ekta Books Pvt Ltd, said that the phenomenon of piracy has tarnished Nepal’s image internationally. “There was a time when Bangladesh would be known as ‘piracy king’,” he said. “Now there's a risk Nepal would take the crown.”As tax increases, so does piracyThe government decision to impose a 10 percent tax on book imports in fiscal year 2019-20 led to a proliferation of pirated book markets, booksellers say. After the decision, booksellers started to cut back on imports and that led to the entry of a new crop of pirated booksellers, a trader in Kathmandu says. But following widespread backlash, then finance minister Bishnu Paudel struck down the policy.“After the government’s decision, we stopped importing books for a while,” says Shrestha of Education Books. “The import of books went down for about two years. Then the pirates stepped in to fill the gap. It was about that time that pirated copies of biographies and memoirs of Obamas and Jai Shettys became omnipresent in the market.”Pirated copies of classics by Roald Dahl and JK Rowling also made an entry in the Nepali market. Then the phenomenon only saw a rise.Since the customs department does not levy duty on foreign books and also does not care to differentiate between the pirated and original copies, unauthorised books have found a safe haven in Nepali market.The government doesn’t levy any customs duty on books and newspapers published by foreign publishers abroad. The importers should only pay Rs565 at the customs points. But Nepali publishers have to pay 10 percent tax to import books printed in India.James Taylor, director of Communications and Freedom to Publish of the International Publishers Association, says that the government, publishers, writers and readers should join hands to control widespread piracy. “The government should realise that book publishing and reading culture contribute to the country’s economy as well,” he said, adding that the government should seize pirated books and close websites that sell pirated ebooks.Nandan Jha, executive vice chair of Penguin Random House India’s sales, production and business department, says that piracy has emerged as a big challenge for publishers of late and has harmed the authors, publishers, distributors, printers, readers and other stakeholders. “To confront piracy, all the stakeholders should launch a special joint effort,” Jha told the Post in an email exchange.Piracy has proliferated in the Nepali market to such an extent that the publishers of such books and unauthorised translations keep whatever ISBN numbers they like, often conflicting with other books, and still get off scot free. If scanned or searched on the internet, the ISBN number gives details on the author of the book, what the book is about, and its price, among others.Bijay Sharma, information officer at TU Library, says, “Keeping ISBN number at one’s will is illegal. If anyone files a complaint, we can punish them.”By the lawThe Muluki Ain-1910 BS had mandated that a publisher take permission of Gorkha Bhasa Prakashini Samiti before publishing any material. The Copyrights Act came into effect in 2022 BS and was amended in 2054 BS. In 2059 BS, a new Act was promulgated and it is still effective now. Authorities are currently working to amend the Act to give the registrar’s office more autonomy regarding copyright.According to the 2059 BS Act, copyright violations are considered government cases. In such cases, plaintiffs should file a complaint with the police. The Act’s clause 25 has various conditions that amount to violation of copyright. The Act’s subclause A says that if a publisher produces or copies material in writing or sound and sells or distributes it, it amounts to violation of copyright.Likewise, the Act’s clause 26 prevents selling of unauthorised material. The clause restricts the ‘importation of copies of work or sound recording, either made in a foreign country or sourced otherwise, into Nepal for business purpose shall not be permitted if preparation of such copies would be considered illegal if they were prepared in Nepal.’If anyone infringes upon protected rights, they are liable to punishment but the provision’s implementation remains lax.The law gives the authority to district court to take legal action against copyright violators.Advocate Parshuram Koirala says that if the government becomes more proactive, it can punish violators on the basis of the 2059 BS Act and thereby control the phenomenon of intellectual theft and copyright violations. “Creation is a crucial part of humanity’s benefit,” he says. “If intellectual property is not protected effectively, then there’d be no inspiration to create something.”Bal Bahadur Mukhiya, a professor at Nepal Law Campus, suggests the inclusion of rules about digital piracy in law, and also the clauses of various related international treaties and agreements that Nepal is part of.“In the US, a teacher or professor should pay a certain revenue even to photocopy a chapter of some text for teaching purposes,” Mukhiya says. “But in Nepal, those who photocopy an entire book and sell it go scot free.”(This report is prepared in collaboration with the Centre for Investigative Journalism, Nepal.) \nThe election for Sri Lanka’s executive presidency was held on September 21. As was widely expected, Anura Kumara Dissanayake from the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP)—a part of the 20-group alliance National Peoples Power (NPP) coalition—was elected president. This was the first time in the country’s history that no candidate secured the mandatory 50 percent vote to get elected, requiring the counting of second preferential votes. The two traditional political parties—the United National Party (UNP) and the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP)—have been extinct from electoral politics since the 2019 election. Two new parties—Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna, led by the Rajapaksa family and Samagi Jana Balawegaya, led by Sajith Premadasa, had risen out of their ashes. The UNP chairman, Ranil Wickremesinghe, the sitting president who independently contested this election, lost the race. This was not the first time JVP contested the presidential election. Rohana Wijeweera, the influential leader of JVP who spearheaded the insurrection, had contested in the 1982 presidential election and received the third-largest votes. Anura Dissanayake contested the 2019 election but didn’t win, receiving only 3.2 percent of the votes. This election was truly historic due to the remarkable victory of JVP. JVP’s pastThe JVP has been in electoral politics since the late 1990s. It has a violent past as it was responsible for two insurrections—1971 and 1988—that were fiercely repressed by the Sri Lankan state, resulting in more than 30,000 deaths of its cadres. As a Marxist Leninist party, its politics are based on class struggle and found a niche in the late 1980s when it championed Sinhala nationalism as the country witnessed Tamil insurgency. The JVP later abandoned its revolutionary path and entered electoral politics. In 1994, it supported the left-leaning SLFP. In 2000, it supported Chandrika Kumaratunga’s People’s Alliance (PA) government from the outside. The PA transformed into UPFA after it allied with the JVP, which won 38 seats in the parliament. However, this alliance did not sustain. The JVP pressurised Rajapaksa to ban the Liberation Tigers of Tamil (LTTE) and abandon the cease-fire brokered by the Norwegians and the peace process. The party forced him to find alternatives to sustain the majority in the parliament and reduce dependency on them as both contested to gratify the Sinhala Buddhist constituency. In 2008, the JVP split over the party’s support of the Rajapaksa regime.Dissanayake as presidentThe JVP has come a long way since its revolutionary days. After the elimination of the LTTE, it diluted its Sinhala nationalist stance; nevertheless, it is opposed to any devolution of power to the Tamils under the 1987 Indo-Sri Lanka Accord, which it had bitterly opposed. This is one of the reasons why the Tamils mostly voted for Sajith Premadasa, as they were continuously suspicious of JVP. It was JVP that moved to the court in Sri Lanka against the merger of the northern and eastern provinces, which was a major demand of the Tamils and provided under the Indo-Sri Lanka Accord of 1987, leading to the demerger in 2007.Notably, the JVP played an important role in rallying the working class and the poor when Sri Lanka declared bankruptcy to eventually force Gotabaya Rajapaksa out of the presidency in 2022. This protest, or Janatha Aragalaya, as it is popularly known, gave the JVP a popular boost as Dissanayake projected himself as an alternative to the tried and tested political parties. It made corruption its main plank in this election—an issue that aragalaya highlighted, apart from endearing the working class with his pro-poor promises.The JVP’s election manifesto promised to investigate political killings, enforced disappearances and abductions and expand efforts of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission to address violence caused by racial and religious extremism. The manifesto of a ‘harmonious Sri Lankan nation’ without discrimination does not recognise the Tamil political demand. The call for ‘inclusivity’ remains a majoritarian project.Election promises and economyThe abolition of the executive presidency has long been on the cards in Sri Lanka. In 2015, after Maithripala Sirisena became president and formed the National Unity Government with Ranil Wikremesinghe as Prime Minister, the president’s power was diluted and transferred to the Parliament, yet he remained powerful. During Gotabaya Rajapaksa’s short-lived regime, much of the powers divested from the president were restored through the 20th Amendment to the Constitution. So, it would be important to see the JVP’s approach to establishing parliamentary democracy. The NPP’s manifesto promises to end pensions, special allowances and benefits for retired presidents and their spouses and abolish the 5-year pension and duty-free vehicle licenses for Members of Parliament, which the party thinks drain the national resources. It has also promised to keep the cabinet size to 25 ministers. But managing government expenditures and efficient tax administration will likely help President Dissanayake put the economy back on track.Between January 2022 and September 2023, 535,000 Sri Lankans sought employment outside the country, and labour force participation was reduced due to the closure of micro, small and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs). Expanding the domestic market to absorb the youth and increase productivity is a challenge. Government data shows that 49.6 percent of the labour force is engaged in the service sector, 25.4 percent in the agriculture sector and 25.0 percent in the industry sector. Inflation has reduced, but poverty has increased and the negative GDP is growing at the rate of 2.2 percent. Dissanayake’s populist slogan to tax the rich and reduce the economic burden caught the people's imagination, especially of the youth, who are tired of the traditional parties and their persisting corrupt ways. The economy remains a major challenge, however, signs of recovery are present as the International Monetary Fund (IMF)-mandated reforms are put in place. Reworking on debt restructuring would delay the much needed release of funds. On September 19, Sri Lanka worked out a deal with creditors to restructure a $12.5 billion international bond. How Dissanayake balances his promise to provide relief to the poor while continuing with the IMF reform process needs to be seen. To implement many of his electoral promises, he would require the support of the majority in parliament, which he does not currently have. The parliamentary election, now scheduled to be held in November, therefore, would be crucial to JVP’s political ascendency. \nIn what may be the only presidential debate before November’s election, Donald Trump and Kamala Harris squared off in Philadelphia on September 10. Topics discussed ranged from the economy to border security, abortion rights to the bizarre but debunked claims about Haitian immigrants consuming cats and dogs, the Taliban, and Ukraine. Since then, many polls and pundits have declared Harris the “winner” of the debate.What does that actually mean, though? The US presidential debates are one of the major four-yearly “shows,” like the World Cup soccer, the UEFA Euro Cup, and the Olympics, in my opinion. The public continues to pay close attention to presidential debates despite technological advancements, the emergence of social media, and streaming platforms. In fact, two of the three most watched presidential debates in American history took place in 2016 (between Trump and Hillary Clinton, with 84.4 million viewers) and 2020 (between Trump and Joe Biden, with 73.1 million viewers). Debating is in our DNA. Nearly three millennia-old, Homer’s Iliad begins with Agamemnon and Achilles squabbling over inherited authority versus talent. While Plato had opposed rhetoric to dialectic, his pragmatic student Aristotle compared the two.Dialectic is primarily philosophical; rhetoric is political; dialectic comprises question-and-answer exchanges and the rhetoric of a predetermined speech. Debates have a profound history in American democracy. There was no moderator present during the seven inperson for the US Senate between Abraham Lincoln and Stephen A. Douglas in 1858! Each discussion was opened by one of the candidates in turn for an hour, followed by a one-and-a-half-hour rebuttal from the other contender and then a half-hour response from the first candidate to close it out. Howard K. Smith moderated the first ever televised presidential debate between John F Kennedy and Richard M Nixon in Chicago in 1960. The two candidates, however, never interrupted one another, launched personal jabs, or questioned one another’s mental health or allegiance to the country.They never called the other person a clown, a liar, or even a socialist; they never even suggested that the other person was a radical Marxist or a covert fanatic. The inaugural debate between Governor Mitt Romney and President Barack Obama in 2012 demonstrates how respectfully and sporadically they interrupted one another. Has the debating culture become more crude, devious, and uncivilised over time, particularly in this post-truth era? In fact, things were completely turned upside down in 2016 after Trump and Clinton’s awful performances in their first debate in Las Vegas failed to inspire voters. Furthermore, many analysts deemed the first of Trump and Biden’s presidential debates in Cleveland in 2020 to be “unwatchable” because it frequently dropped to unexpectedly low levels. The altercation between the two candidates resembled a schoolyard brawl. The crucial query is, however, can presidential debates actually have an impact on changing voter behaviour? Overall, the answer may be basically “no.”After analysing pre- and post-election surveys from 1952 to 2017, Vincent Pons of Harvard Business School and Caroline Le PennecCaldichoury of the University of California, Berkeley demonstrated that voter choice was not greatly impacted by televised debates. In a 2019 article, Pons was quoted as saying, “There’s this perception that debates are this great democratic tool where voters can find out what candidates stand for and how good they really are.” However, “we find that debates don’t have any effect on any group of voters.” Professors of communication at the University of Missouri, Mitchell McKinney and Benjamin Warner, examined survey responses from undergraduate students attending US universities between 2000 and 2012 and found that 86.3 percent of respondents’ choices of candidates remained the same both before and after watching the debate.Just 7 percent of respondents who were unsure made a choice after watching the discussion, while only 3.5 percent changed their opinions. Well, that could make a difference in a close contest! Who knows? It’s interesting to note that independents and undecided voters, who are most likely to be affected by the debates, are also the least likely to watch them. Indeed, those who watch debates are often among the most politically involved, so they probably already had their opinions formed before the discussion even started. For these folks, watching debates mostly serves as a spectator sport, with little to no impact on their opinions of the candidates other than seeing how their favourite performs.The inaugural 2020 presidential debate was held on September 29. Voting analysis platform FiveThirtyEight’s average showed that, as of September 28, Biden had 50.1 percent of the support while Trump had 43.2 percent. On September 30, Biden’s percentage was 50.5 percent, while Trump’s was 42.9 percent. Similarly, there was little difference in the polling results before and after the second debate. On 26 September 2016, Clinton and Trump faced off in their tense first debate.Most experts suggested that Clinton had dominated the debate. But according to FiveThirtyEight’s poll average, that performance barely moved the needle. On September 25, Trump’s percentage was at 40.5 percent, and Clinton’s was at 42.4 percent. On September 27, Clinton’s polling position was 42.5 percent, while Trump’s was 41 percent. The same may be said of the other two 2016 debates. Nevertheless, debates are important because they reveal the issues that candidates value most, which gives voters hints about how to form their views. Reaction to debate issues and narratives generally drives the week after the debate. Crucially, there are still unanswered concerns regarding the likelihood that any opinion changes resulting from the debate will last.The amount of postdebate campaign communication frequently overwhelms any discernible consequences of the events relatively fast. Furthermore, due to earlier access to ballots in different states, even small post-debate changes could be consequential in 2024. There have been instances, though, where debates have helped a certain candidate’s chances. Ask Barack Obama. In 2008, within a few days of the first debate on September 26, Obama managed to take a significant lead. The Pew Research Centre reports that shortly after the debate, Obama’s support increased to 49 from 46 percent. This undoubtedly gave his presidential campaign more impetus. In actuality, presidential debates can affect voters’ perceptions of a candidate, as demonstrated by the cases of Obama in 2008 and Kennedy in 1960. Kennedy participated in four presidential debates in 1960 alongside Republican Nixon, who served as outgoing President Dwight Eisenhower’s vice president.Though Nixon performed better among those who listened on the radio, a commonly accepted narrative that arose from those debates says that the younger, more vivacious Kennedy gained popularity over Nixon among those who watched the debates on television. According to a Purdue University study, one explanation for this could be that Kennedy “appeared better on television than Nixon.” Furthermore, despite the fact that debates typically have a small impact, 2024 has already shown to be different. Joe Biden decided not to run for re-election after his dismal performance in the June 27 debate utterly turned the race upside down.A few minutes into the debate, the Democratic Party experienced a profound, widespread, and very aggressive panic. Immediately after the debate, some in the party started urging Biden to withdraw from the presidential contest. Though highly unusual, Biden’s withdrawal was a seminal event in American history. From a different perspective, that debate effectively shifted the momentum in favour of the Democrats, which would not have been straightforward perhaps had Kamala Harris been chosen at the outset! Whatever the situation, let’s enjoy how the fantastic four-year show has evolved.-The Statesman (India)/ANN \nPrime Minister Khadga Prasad Sharma Oli was initiated into Marxist-Leninist-Maoist (MLM) politics of Jhapali Naxals quite early in his life. He began his political career by participating in what is euphemistically called the “elimination of class enemies”. He was caught, prosecuted, found guilty of involvement in manslaughter and was sent to rigorous imprisonment. Premier Sharma Oli received all his adult education in incarceration. He has been socialised with some of the most hardened criminals in the harshest of conditions. Adult education in a prison isn’t the most appropriate way of acquiring social refinement. He received a royal pardon after spending 14 years in various jails and came out a bitter man determined to succeed.Once one understands the ‘education’ of the Khas-Arya chieftain Sharma Oli, it becomes easy to make sense of his earthy proverbs, insulting turns of phrases and bigoted expressions. He chooses his words carefully so as to hurt his target without sounding explicitly abusive, profane or slanderous. He once used a Newari phrase, Maka Phui, to dismiss the movement of Janjati because a translated version in any other language would have sounded inappropriate and insulting. He termed the human chain of Madheshis in 2015 as Makhe Sanglo. A literal translation of the expression would be ‘a chain of flies’, but the simile in Nepali language also means the net that a spider weaves to catch flies. The entire Khas-Arya intelligentsia comes out in full force to protect its chieftain with a charitable explanation whenever Sharma Oli spouts any calumny that has the potential of having a double meaning. Unfortunately, what he recently said about Nepal’s land ‘neighbours’ lacks any nuance. Frustrated with not getting the attention that he thinks he deserves, he let out a stream of invectives that were clearly not meant for the Chinese. He said in Nepali that he doesn’t want the relationship to be chhudra and jaali with its neighbour.Clearly, words have been carefully chosen, and sentences meticulously crafted to cover the intended impact of the statement. According to Pragya Nepali Brihat Shabdakosh, jaali can also mean fraudulent and hypocritical behaviour. The term chhudra literally means being mean, but it also suggests being ‘mean-spirited, vile, ignominious and dishonest’. It is possible that Sharma Oli has nothing but good intentions for Nepal’s southern neighbour, but his increasingly harsh statements are unlikely to do much good to improve bilateral relations. The courtesy extended to him for a meeting in New York may just be an opportunity for the Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi to show that Nepal is not yet off the radar of India’s Neighbourhood First policy. But unless the tongue at the top level of Nepal is restrained, it’s extremely unlikely that concerned minds from both countries can manage longstanding irritants.Border rowThe textbook system of Nepal is basically uniform, with a slightly guided freedom for private schools to add some other teaching material of their choice. The Ministry of Education sanctions the contents, and the Janak Education Material Centre (JEMC)—a parastatal with a monopoly over the production and distribution of textbooks—takes them to schools all over the country. The JMEC hadn’t produced a single geography book till the second decade of the 21st century that had Lipulekh and Limpiyadhura anywhere on it. What exactly changed in 2020 that prompted the then Pratinidhi Sabha to unilaterally amend an existing map enshrined in every bilateral and multilateral agreement till then? Other than the paroxysm of jingoism, it’s difficult to come up with a logical answer.Sovereign countries acquire or lose territory primarily through four means—war, settlement, reward or occupation. The last time Nepal fought a war with the East India Company, it lost considerable territory. There has been no fresh border settlement between Kathmandu and New Delhi. Since the Kashmir imbroglio, no international agency has been allowed to interfere in South Asia; hence, the question of a tribunal rewarding Nepal doesn’t arise. As far as the occupation goes, Indians clearly have an advantage at the source of Mahakali. All claims based on the disputed documents of the colonial era are play acting at best.Premier Sharma Oli probably never attended a proper school for long. He can thus be forgiven for not knowing much about Nepal’s academic, official and diplomatic maps that had been in circulation till 2020. However, the parliament that adopted the revised version was full of learned scholars who had attended some of the best universities in the world. When a chauvinistic director also writes the script, fear of being labelled ‘anti-national’ drives all possible dissenters into silent acquiescence. Treaty tantrumsIt’s extremely difficult, even if not outright impossible, to resolve competing claims over contested territories. Irrespective of the nature, no government can afford to appear as if it’s giving up control over even a small piece of land. Despots fear the judgement of history, though King Mahendra apparently didn’t and had little hesitation in bartering away a bit of it to the north and the west to acquire international support for his absolutist regime. Democratic rulers are afraid of the voters’ wrath. All one can do about border disputes is let them fester until the line of actual control ultimately acquires international legitimacy and domestic acceptance almost by default. Unlike the sanctity of territorial boundaries, treaties between consenting countries aren’t written in stone. The 1969 Vienna Convention defines a treaty as \"an international agreement concluded between States in written form and governed by international law”. When ground realities change, competent signatories to the instrument can renegotiate terms, reach to an agreement and decide to incorporate mutually agreed-upon amendments into the existing treaty or replace it with a new one. Such instruments usually require ratification by sovereign authorities of consenting countries.The Treaty of Peace and Friendship between the Government of India and the Government of Nepal was signed on July 31, 1950, in Kathmandu. The instrument has a termination clause: “This Treaty shall remain in force until it is terminated by either party by giving one year's notice.” Perhaps India interprets any attempt at amendment as its termination and is hesitant to formulate a new treaty altogether.A lot has changed in Nepal since the 1950s. King Birendra’s Zone of Peace proposal was meant to circumvent the treaty without terminating it. When the Eminent Persons’ Group was formed in January 2016, perhaps Kathmandu and New Delhi had different expectations from their recommendations. Even though the report hasn’t been made public, the South Block probably expects its contents about the treaty of 1950 disagreeable and has decided not to open it. The clamour in Kathmandu that it be accepted in New Delhi is akin to flogging a dead horse: Unless forced upon one party by another or mutually agreed upon, no changes in bilateral relationship are practicable.Perhaps it’s a little too early and too much to expect that a brief meeting between Premier Sharma Oli and Indian Prime Minister Modi in New York could clear the misunderstanding between two of the closest countries in the world. Ancient ties take long to transform. \nOn Sunday, Nepal’s Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli met his Indian counterpart Narendra Modi on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly in New York. Although there was little in terms of outcomes, it was nonetheless an important meeting. Top Indian leaders and bureaucrats have been reluctant to engage with Oli following his 2020 initiative to insert into the Nepali national charter a map of Nepal incorporating Kalapani. The Indians were also upset, unsurprisingly, when Oli, during his previous stint as prime minister, mocked the official Indian emblem, saying it represented the adage ‘Singhamev Jayate’ (power alone triumphs) rather than ‘Satyamev Jayate’ (truth alone triumphs). Separately, the CPN-UML chief riled the BJP establishment when he baselessly claimed that Lord Ram was born in Nepal’s Thori rather than India’s Ayodhya. So India has good reasons not to trust Oli. Yet the way it was consistently rebuffing Oli’s recent overtures for a bilateral meeting with Modi was unbecoming too. The Indians may not particularly like Oli, ‘China’s man’ in the reckoning of many Indian analysts. Yet they also cannot refuse to engage with the elected leader of a traditionally close partner country. Given the closeness of their relationship, Nepal and India have no option but to continue to engage at all levels, at all times. For instance, Sunday’s meeting may not have led to anything more substantive than Modi’s assurance that he will soon visit Nepal. But just the fact that the two leaders met is loaded with symbolism. India, which claims undisputed leadership of South Asia, cannot fulfil that role by sidelining the democratically elected leaders of its neighbouring countries. Such an approach will also be a mockery of Modi’s Neighbourhood First policy. It is vital for heads of government to talk as that sends a positive message down the official chain of command, opening up many new avenues of cooperation. For Oli, the meeting was also a matter of optics. Just like Modi likes to buttress his image at home by presenting himself as a rock star in his mass rallies abroad, Nepali leaders do so through their engagements with top world leaders, particularly those of India and China. Prime Minister Oli will now no doubt play up his meeting with Modi, while trying to rubbish the claim that India somehow wants to see him gone soon.Whatever the case, it is wonderful that the Nepali and Indian prime ministers are talking. This time, the Nepali side could not discuss its preferred issues like Kalapani and Eminent Persons' Group (EPG). But these issues can be brought up at different bilateral mechanisms between the two countries that the two prime ministers agreed to revive on Sunday. In the larger scheme of things, India’s leadership of the South Asian region has again come under scrutiny following the ignominious fall of one of its darlings, Sheikh Hasina of Bangladesh. The lesson for New Delhi is clear enough: Stop trying to pick favourites in the neighbourhood. That will only backfire in the long run. A better course of action for India would be to continue to engage all democratic constituencies in the region and let the democratic process take its own natural course—be it in Bangladesh, Sri Lanka or Nepal. On the part of Nepali leaders, they must forswear their dual nature whereby they become the most ardent anti-India critics, only to later try to cosy up to New Delhi when it is politically expedient for them to do so.  \nAccording to a recent report published in this daily, at least 440 people have died by falling off cliffs in 10 districts of Karnali Province in the past 11 years. Salyan district topped the list with 117 deaths. Police said six people died in similar incidents in Karnali in the first two months of the current fiscal year 2024-25. A large number of other people were badly injured. Many of them lost their lives or limbs when they fell from cliffs and trees in the course of foraging for grass and firewood. People in this province, which is mostly covered in hills and mountains, often die while traversing risky roads and even while walking along treacherous paths carved into dizzying cliffs. It is a matter of shame for Nepal that a large number of its people are dying in the course of just going about their daily lives. This is not a problem specific to Karnali Province. People are killed in similar incidents across the country. Also, falls are taken as a serious problem around the globe, though the nature of incidents differ. It is the second leading cause of unintentional injury deaths worldwide. According to the World Health Organisation, each year, an estimated 684,000 individuals die from falls globally—and over 80 percent of these deaths are in low- and middle-income countries. A study titled “Fall injuries in Nepal: A countrywide population-based survey” identifies falls as a ‘crucial public health concern’.When it comes to safety measures, Nepalis in general seem negligent and the degree of negligence is more concerning in remote regions like Karnali. This calls for a serious awareness drive in order to make people take precautions and prevent such incidents. There must be more robust safety arrangements in accident-prone areas, and the rules must be strictly enforced. Extra effort is needed when such campaigns are run in low-literacy areas. Youth literacy in the Karnali Province is 66.17 percent, even as the national rate is 85 percent; the population of those in absolute poverty in the province is 28.9 percent, even as the national ratio is 18.7 percent.The provincial and local governments themselves need to devise plans and programmes to address this problem as they understand the local complications, people’s necessities, and the kind of alternative arrangements needed. When it comes to deaths from falls, the priority should obviously be prevention. For that, the local authorities need to devise alternative paths to more treacherous routes, fence off certain places and quickly repair the essential roads. In some cases, they may even need to restrict people’s movements in particularly dangerous zones.As vital is to properly handle the injuries after the incidents and prevent the condition of the injured from getting worse. Right now, many places in Karnali lack even basic healthcare services. Some injuries get worse when people either don’t know how to handle the injured people or don’t have access to stretchers to carry them. Carrying severely injured people long distances for treatment is particularly difficult. Many deaths and injuries could be avoided if only the local health facilities were equipped a little better, both in terms of equipment and manpower.  \nNepal's COVID-19 lockdown accelerated its transition to a cashless economy, bringing benefits like reduced corruption and increased convenience, despite ongoing challenges with taxation and internet costs.\nA parliamentary committee has uncovered a cooperative scam involving the misappropriation of Rs2.58 billion, with Rabi Lamichhane directly implicated in embezzling cooperative funds through his media company, leading to the government implementing the report's recommendations and launching investigations.\nNepal marks its ninth Constitution Day, prompting discussions on amending the constitution; constitutional expert Purna Man Shakya highlights crucial considerations, including broad consensus, a thorough review process, and addressing concerns of marginalized communities.\nNepal's legal recognition of queer rights, including same-sex marriage, is contrasted with ongoing social and cultural challenges, and the narrative of progressiveness is seen as limiting further change.\nNepal's Federal Parliament amended the Enforced Disappearances and Reconciliation Act, aligning with Supreme Court directives and addressing international concerns, paving the way for the completion of the peace process and the establishment of two transitional justice commissions.\nThe Meteorological Forecasting Division has predicted generally to mostly cloudy conditions across the country on Thursday.The met office said that light to moderate rainfall is expected in many areas in a weather bulletin. Thunderstorms are also likely in several provinces, with warnings of heavy rainfall at isolated locations.Likewise, light to moderate rain accompanied by thunder and lightning is expected in parts of all provinces. Heavy rainfall is forecast at one or two places in Koshi, Madhesh, Lumbini, Karnali, and Sudurpaschim provinces. Likewise, heavy to very heavy rainfall is expected at one or two locations in Koshi, Madhesh, Lumbini, and Sudurpaschim provinces.Tonight, similar weather patterns will continue with generally to mostly cloudy skies across the country. Light to moderate rain and thunderstorms are likely in Koshi, Madhesh, Bagmati, Gandaki, and Sudurpaschim provinces, with some showers expected in other areas. Heavy to very heavy rainfall is forecasted at one or two locations in Koshi, Madhesh, Bagmati, Gandaki, and Lumbini provinces.The monsoon low-pressure system remains positioned south of its average location, bringing the country under the influence of monsoon winds. Additionally, a low-pressure system developed over the Bay of Bengal is affecting Nepal’s weather conditions.On Wednesday, Dipayal recorded the highest maximum temperature at 33.4°C, while Jomsom experienced the lowest minimum temperature at 13.5°C. Lumle registered the highest rainfall at 128.1 mm, followed by Pokhara with 71.6 mm and Biratnagar with 57.9 mm. \nGenerally cloudy conditions with light to moderate rainfall and thunder, with a chance of heavy rain in four provinces; partly cloudy with light rain in most parts of the country tonight, with possible heavy rainfall in four provinces.\nAn effect of a low-pressure system developed over the Bay of Bengal will cause light to moderate rainfall throughout the country from Thursday to Saturday.According to the Meteorological Forecasting Division of the Department of Hydrology and Meteorology, a few places in Gandaki, Lumbini, and Sudurpaschim provinces and a couple of regions in Koshi Province could also witness extremely heavy rainfall.“Moisture coming from the Bay of Bengal caused partial to general cloudy conditions on Tuesday in many places throughout the country, and some places of the western part of Lumbini Province and Tarai region of Sudurpaschim Province witnessed light to moderate rainfall with a thunderstorm,” said Pratibha Manandhar, a senior meteorologist. “A few places in all provinces will witness light to moderate rainfall and thunderstorms on Wednesday as well.”The Met Office said there is a chance of heavy rainfall in a few places of Sudurpaschim and one to two places of Koshi, Bagmati, Gandaki, and Lumbini Province on Wednesday. One to two places of Sudurpaschim Province could witness extremely heavy rainfall also.“The weather will remain general to completely cloudy from Thursday to Saturday, and most places across the country will witness light to moderate rainfall,” reads the special bulletin issued by the division.Red alerts have been issued in Ilam and Panchthar of Koshi Province; Tanahun, Lamjung, Kaski, Syangja, Parbat, Baglung and Myagdi of Gandaki Province; Palpa, Gulmi, Arghakhanchi, Pyuthan, Rukum East, Rolpa, Dang, Bardia and Banke of Lumbini Province; Surkhet, Salyan, Rukum-West, Jajarkot, Dailekh of Karnali Province; and Kailali, Kanchanpur, Dadeldhura and Doti districts of Sudurpaschim Province.According to Met officials, a red warning means looming extreme weather conditions. Excessive rainfall, floods, landslides, and inundation will likely cause widespread damage. For the general public, it is a message to keep themselves and others safe from the extreme weather consequences and not to travel in risky zones.An orange alert has been issued in 42 districts, including all districts of Bagmati Province.An orange warning also means moderate risks. Experts say severe situations due to extreme weather events are very likely in the districts. For the general public, it is a message to prepare plans for potential emergencies. As the probability of extreme weather events is high, people are also requested not to travel in risky zones—landslide-prone areas and riverbanks, among others. The department has cautioned the public about risks of land erosion, debris flow and inundation in urban areas and in the Tarai.“Everyday life, agriculture, health, tourism, road and air transport could also be affected,” the bulletin stated.The monsoon season in Nepal generally begins on June 13 and ends on September 23. This year, the clouds from the south entered Nepal from the western region on June 10, three days ahead of the usual onset date. Last year, the weather phenomenon started on June 14, a day prior to the normal onset day.The monsoon season, which delivers around 80 percent of the country’s total annual rainfall, generally lasts 105 days. But, in recent years, it has been taking more time to withdraw.This year, too, monsoon rainfall will be prolonged by at least five days. “We cannot rule out rainfall during Dashain,” said Manandhar.As predicted before the onset of monsoon, Nepal recorded above-average rainfall this season.According to the Met office data, the country received 1,514.5 millimetres of rainfall as of Tuesday since the monsoon entered on June 10, 102.4 percent—2.4 percent above the average monsoon rainfall.Normally, the country receives an average of 1,472 mm of rainfall in the four months—June, July, August, and September. Last year, however, the country witnessed only 1,303 mm of rainfall in the season, 88.5 percent of the average.Nepal is one of the world’s most vulnerable countries to the climate crisis and has witnessed multiple extreme weather events over the past decade and a half.Evidence suggests that maximum temperatures in Nepal are rising faster, at 0.056 degrees Celsius a year, compared to the annual global average rise of 0.03 degrees Celsius.Experts say extreme weather events—excessive rainfall in a short period, continuous rains for several days after the monsoon, dry spells, droughts, below-average precipitation, and above-normal winter temperatures—have become more frequent in Nepal. \n\nBe elaborative as possible.
