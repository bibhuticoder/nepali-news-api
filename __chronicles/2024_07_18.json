Write it in the form of inspiring story not news article or event.\n    \n    Story:\nOnce upon a time, nestled between the towering peaks of the Himalayas and the lush jungles of the Terai, there was a country named Nepal. Though still a developing nation, Nepal was a land of profound beauty and deep-rooted cultural heritage. The residents of Nepal faced many challenges, but beneath these hardships lay a resilient spirit and an unyielding hope for the future.\n\nThis enchanting land, where Mount Everest reaches towards the skies and the air carries a mix of incense and cool mountain breezes, was more than a geographical marvel. It was a mosaic of cultures, languages, and traditions, a testament to human endeavor against all odds. Nepal's history, from the unification under King Prithvi Narayan Shah to its transformation into a federal democratic republic, told a story of aspiration and endurance.\n\nIn recent years, the people of Nepal, with their indomitable will, had taken strides towards rebuilding and reimagining their country. They turned their struggles into stepping stones, each challenge a chapter in their ongoing saga. The shift from a monarchy to a republic had not only changed governance but had woven a new tapestry of democratic values and collective decision-making.\n\nEconomically, while agriculture continued to sustain a large part of its population, Nepal had begun to harness the potential of its picturesque landscapes, developing sustainable tourism that promised to preserve their natural heritage while boosting local economies. Communities living in the shadows of the Himalayas had become stewards of the earth, protecting the biodiversity that made their country unique.\n\nEach day brought new stories. Whether it was a festival in Kathmandu, a technological advance in Pokhara, or a conservation effort in Chitwan, these events were threads in the vibrant quilt of Nepali life. These stories, updated daily, reflected the pulse of progress and the spirit of hope that characterized this resilient nation.\n\nAnd so, as Nepal moved forward, each moment was not just a passage of time but a promise of potential, a narrative of a nation perennially climbing towards tomorrow, guided by the legacy of its past and the dreams of its future.\n\nNews events:\nAt a time when the transitional justice commissions have been defunct for more than two years, Nepal Police has started inquiries about the victims of enforced disappearance, their family members say.On Monday, a police team from Lalitpur visited the houses of such victims in the Thecho area where they asked the families if the missing persons had returned or if they had established any contacts. The team also reached Nagma Mali’s house to inquire about the whereabouts of her father. Nandagopal Mali, who was arrested by the security forces, has been missing since June 22, 2004.“I was not home when the police arrived. Later they called to ask if I had any updates on my father,\" she told the Post. \"It came as a shock and I suspect the police have taken up the issue as the transitional justice commissions remain defunct. It is a worrying sign if true.\"Victims’ rights advocates say the police who went door to door on Monday claimed to have received a circular from the Police Headquarters to study the situation.\"The victims have reported that the police who visited their place said they were doing their job as directed by the central office,\" Suman Adhikari, founding chairperson of the Conflict Victims Common Platform, told the Post. \"What is the government trying to do by mobilising the security agency to look into war-era cases while keeping the transitional justice commissions defunct?”The Truth and Reconciliation Commission and the Commission for the Investigation of Enforced Disappeared Persons (CIEDP) have been paralysed since July 2022, after the government decided to extend their terms without retaining their chairmen and members. The CIEDP has the responsibility to investigate the cases of enforced disappearances. Against the government’s claim that the bill to amend the Enforced Disappearances Enquiry, Truth and Reconciliation Commission Act would be endorsed by October 2022 and open the door for recruiting new office bearers, there has been no progress even after two years. The government has already given four extensions to the two commissions in two years.Through its last Cabinet meeting, the Pushpa Kamal Dahal government on July 19 extended their terms by another year. However, it is still unsure when the Act gets amended and the defunct commissions get their office bearers. The government employees deployed to the commissions lack authority to conduct works other than day-to-day administration.The Dahal government on April 12 had formed a committee to recommend the office bearers for the two commissions. However, it is yet to hold its first meeting as the National Human Rights Commission has refused to send its representatives until there is commitment from the government and the political parties to endorse the amendment.“Rather than using intimidation tactics by mobilising the police, the government should work towards a proper revision in the Act and ensuring that the two commissions become functional,” said Adhikari.Nepal Police, however, denied having issued any such circular recently. “Finding the missing persons is our job, which we always do. However, there has been no circular to subordinate offices to carry out inquiries targeting the missing people from the conflict time,”Dan Bahadur Karki, the Nepal Police spokesperson, told the Post. “There are separate commissions to look into these matters.”The commissions were formed in February 2015 with a two-year deadline to investigate cases of atrocities committed during the war. But nine years since, their terms have been extended for around 10 times without any tangible results.The commission on disappearances got a total of 3,223 complaints. However, it has shortlisted only 2,506 cases for investigation after a study that the other complaints did not fall within its jurisdiction. \nNepal, India and Bangladesh have agreed to sign an agreement on July 28 on the export of Nepal’s 40MW of electricity to Bangladesh via India.Officials from the Nepal Electricity Authority (NEA), the Bangladesh Power Development Board (BPDB) and the NTPC Vidyut Vyapar Nigam Ltd (NVVN) of India will sign the agreement at a function in Kathmandu.Minister for Energy, Water Resources and Irrigation Dipak Khadka of Nepal; Power Minister Manohar Lal of India; and Power, Energy and Mineral Resources Minister Nasrul Hamid of Bangladesh are scheduled to witness the signing ceremony in Kathmandu, NEA Spokesperson Nabinraj Singh said.“After the signing ceremony in the Capital, joint secretary and secretary level meetings will be held on July 29 and 30, respectively, to expedite the process,” Singh said.The meetings of the joint-secretary level Nepal-Bangladesh Joint Working Group (JWG) and the secretary level Joint Steering Committee (JSC) will expedite the work as per the agreement.Nepal and Bangladesh will finalise the deal six years after they reached an understanding on energy cooperation. With this agreement, the NEA will export 40MW hydroelectricity to Bangladesh from June 15 to November 15 every year.As per the agreement, Nepal is estimated to sell 144,000 MWh (megawatt-hour) electricity in five months at the rate of 6.4 US cents a unit.Nepal will transmit the energy to India through the 400KV Dhalkebar-Muzaffarpur cross-border transmission line and before India transmits the equivalent to Bangladesh. The NEA will calculate the quantum of exported energy at the Mazaffarpur point. The NEA estimates an earning of around Rs330 million for the country through the sale. Nepal needs to use Indian transmission facilities to transmit the electricity as Nepal and Bangladesh aren’t directly linked to each other. Energy trade between the two countries became possible only after India was ready to facilitate the process.A month ago, a meeting of the ‘Cabinet Committee on Government Purchase’ of Bangladesh had approved a proposal to import 40 MW of electricity from Nepal. The proposal was put forth by the Power Division of the Bangladesh Power Development Board (BPDB). \nAsturni Dagoura turned 75 last May. She spent more than half of her life as a Kamaiya, indentured labourer, in her landlord’s property where her children were born, grew up, eventually following in her footsteps as Kamaiyas themselves. It wasn’t long before she was able to get the family together. She was married at the age of eight to Krishna Bahadur, who also worked as a Kamaiya in a landlord’s house at Badikhalla of Krishnapur Municipality. Asturni did not know how much money he had borrowed or how long he had been there, but she joined him after their marriage.The practice of such form of slavery (Kamaiya), which is unthinkable in the 21st century, was prevalent across the western Tarai districts of Dang, Banke, Bardiya, Kailali and Kanchanpur, predominantly among the Tharu community. Although the government had announced the liberation of Kamaiyas in the year 2000, the freed families languished in camps for years in lack of effective rehabilitation programmes. In the past there was fear of epidemics like malaria in the Tarai. Migration was the only way to escape epidemics. Managing land, cattle, and finding accommodation in a new place was challenging. Those who could not manage often worked as labourers in other people’s fields to eke out a living. During those times, those who earned a living by working in other people’s fields were traditionally known as Kamashu (Kamaiya) in the Tharu language.After the 1960s, many people from the hilly communities started migrating to the Tarai. After that, the landlords started exploiting the Tharu community. In the beginning, those who had a lot of land would allocate land and grain to the indentured workers. But as even landowners struggled due to dwindling land and income, inhumane treatment started as they could not even provide enough for food. According to a study done by Ram Bahadur Chhetri in 2008, Kamaiya practice has existed for around 200 years in Nepal. Before that, the tribal Tharus owned plenty of land. Over time, as their land dwindled, they started living as Kamaiyas. They were responsible for all household chores, from farming to cattle grazing, at the estates where they worked. Men ploughed, dug, fetched and chopped firewood, while women farmed, washed clothes, and tended to the cattle.Asturni worked from dawn to dusk. She would rise at 4 in the morning to clean the barn, feed the cattle, cut the grass and wash the clothes. After that, she would work on the farm. For all this work, the moneylender would give a certain amount of paddy and wheat, which would be insufficient. If they asked for more food, their loan would increase, making it almost impossible to escape. Now, Asturni’s daily life has changed. She doesn’t have to work from morning till evening and her family is together. All are engaged in their own profession. She no longer has to toil like a slave. On July 17, 2000, the Nepal Government announced the liberation of Kamaiyas. But after the announcement, there was confusion for some time. The freed workers were housed in camps and there was no work. Without employment, finding enough food became a problem. Gradually, the government began distributing land for rehabilitation.Then they began to feel that they were free. “After we got the land, we decided to live,” said Asturni, “then we gradually started working from farming.” When the freedom of Kamaiyas was announced, 2,462 family records were collected in Kanchanpur. Then in 2002, around 2,000 families were collected and the number of freed Kamaiyas’ families in this district reached about 4,500.Initially, they were kept in nine camps, and later rehabilitated by providing each family plots ranging from half kattha to five kattha (around 170 square metres to 1700 square metres of land) in different places of the district. The size of the allotted land depended on its value, proximity to markets, and location—rural or urban areas.However, most of the rehabilitated Kamaiya settlements are situated along riverbanks, so there is a risk of flooding.A year after their liberation, under the rehabilitation programme, Asturni’s family was allotted five kattha of land (1700 square metres) on the bank of Chaudhar River in Ashapur area of Bedkot Municipality in Kanchanpur district. After that, her sons, who were working in different places as Kamaiyas, reunited with the family at the same place. Asturni was very happy to have the entire family together. Vikram, her eldest son, lived as a Kamaiya in Daiji of Bedkot Municipality, while her middle child, Bal Bahadur was in Krishnapur municipality, and the youngest, Man Bahadur lived in Samadaiji in Bedkot. After their liberation, all of them received land in the same area.They had received land on the bank of the Chaudhar River, where flooding and erosion occurred during the rainy season. There was a settlement of people from the hill community nearby. Man Bahadur Dagoura recounted how people from the community threatened them claiming that the riverside land belonged to them.Now a lot has changed in Ashapur. The houses that were built during the rehabilitation of the freed Kamaiyas have all been replaced with concrete houses. Flooded fields have been turned into safe farmlands by constructing embankments. Some residents are engaged in vegetable farming, others as masons, while some have gone to India for employment. Everyone is engaged in some profession. Three people are employed overseas.Initially, a total of 16 families were rehabilitated in the area, but now the number of families has reached 36. There are 15 masons with 15-20 others working as their assistants.“Now we can do what we want. The income is also good,” said Man Bahadur, adding, “This has changed the lives of us all.” He has built a concrete house at the cost of over Rs2 million earned from vegetable farming, and sends his son to school. He grows seasonal and non-seasonal vegetables on his own five kattha and additional 10 kattha of rented land. He says that he earned a net profit of around Rs400,000-500,000 a year.Bal Bahadur Dagoura, who spent his 30 years as a Kamaiya, is now a construction worker. After the announcement of the Kamaiya liberation, various organisations provided skill training and Bal Bahadur learned masonry.Janaki Chaudhari of Ashapur vividly recalls her former landlord’s harsh treatment. She was forced to lift heavy loads, even while pregnant. “The pain and suffering we faced while working as Kamaiya is unspeakable,” said Janaki, who is now engaged in commercial vegetable farming. She says she earns up to Rs250,000 per season. \nThe Kathmandu Metropolitan City has resumed pavement widening in the New Road area from Wednesday. Officials at the Public Construction Department under the metropolis said that the contractor resumed the work after the High Court, Patan issued an interim order paving the way for following an interim order from the High Court, Patan allowing the work to proceed. “Now there is no obstruction from locals nor from federal government agencies,” said Baburam Bhattarai, a member of the City Planning Commission under the KMC. “We hope that the project will be completed at the earliest.”The metropolis had awarded a contract to widen the sidewalks by 1.5 metres along both sides of the road section between the New Road gate and the Juddha Statue roundabout in the last fiscal year. The work started in the New Road area in May, but a jurisdictional dispute between the city office and the Road Division, Kathmandu, caused the project to come to a halt. The division confiscated contractors' equipment, and the federal government deployed police in to prevent the city office from working. Some local residents, too, had demonstrated against the pavement widening plan. The division had even repaired the parts of roads cut for pavement expansion.And on June 9, the metropolis moved the High Court challenging the breach of jurisdiction by the road division, which is a federal agency, and its intervention in the city’s work.City officials were already frustrated by the years-long delay by federal agencies in completing another project, the widening of Kathmandu’s Ring Road in the Kalanki-Maharajgunj section, which has caused huge inconvenience to the public due to dust and mud.Mayor Balendra Shah then directed city officials to dump truckloads of dirt from the Ring Road section in front of the main entrance of the Road Division office at Minbhawan, accusing federal agencies of delaying the work.The 8.2km Kalanki-Maharajgunj section was set to be widened by the Chinese government, and the work was initially planned to start in early 2020, but the project has not progressed even after years due to Covid and delays in clearing the power poles and in some cases structures along the right of way.Regarding the jurisdiction dispute over the sidewalk widening work in the city, a division bench of judges Dhurba Raj Nand and Prakash Kharel at the High Court Patan issued an interim order in favour of the metropolis on Sunday.The City office has already widening pavements by 1 metre on both sides in the Bhrikutimandap area. “Neither did the federal government agency intervene, nor did locals object while expanding pavement in the Bhrikutimandap area by narrowing the road,” said Bhattarai. “Further decisions on pavement widening in other areas like Thamel, Handigaun and others will be taken after collecting public feedback.”Officials said that the long-term plan is to restrict motor vehicles altogether in the New Road area due to heavy pedestrian traffic. “We have also been working to find a solution to the parking problem and weighing various options including setting up multi-storey parking facilities,” said Bhattarai, who is also an urban planner.Officials said that pavements in the New Road area, which always remain crowded, should be widened to ensure free pedestrian movement. Officials claimed that New Road residents have also requested the city office to expand the pavement.According to city officials, local residents have, from time to time, complained about feeling unsafe and experiencing sexual harassment on the narrow and crowded sidewalks. \nBelahiya border point in southwest Nepal has been made a hassle-free crossing point, at least for Indian travellers.Following many complaints from unhappy travellers, especially Indians who visit Nepal in private vehicles, the district administration has started providing service through a one-window system.The district administration launched an integrated checkpoint, a new facility, last Wednesday. Indian tourists, who don’t require passports, and drive across the border are not subjected to lengthy customs waits to get a temporary vehicle pass.Under the new system, police and customs officials will jointly conduct security checks and issue a security clearance card.Tourism entrepreneurs hailed the government initiative, stating that such a fast-track system would send a positive message and help bring more tourists from India to Nepal. Earlier, Indian tourists who came via road had to undergo repeated checks, and their vehicles were searched multiple times. “All the checks are now completed at one place. After the clearance, the Indian vehicles will not require additional checks within Rupandehi district,” said Ganesh Aryal, chief district officer of Rupandehi. “But if the security personnel have suspicions, they can conduct a check at any time.”The vehicles which have been issued the ‘yellow card’ can go anywhere hassle-free, Aryal said.The system is basically for Indian tourists, who are not put through the immigration process or need to have their passports stamped like tourists from third countries do. Belahiya is a major entry point. It is the gateway to Lumbini, the birthplace of the Buddha, and receives nearly 80 percent of overland foreign tourists. The point also attracts many Indian visitors, as Chitwan and Pokhara are easily accessible from there. These destinations are becoming most popular for Indian tourists of late.Tourism entrepreneurs say that once the six-lane Narayanghat-Butwal road is completed, Nepal could receive millions of Indian visitors.The government has recently allowed Indian visitors to pay in Nepal through the quick response (QR) code system, reducing the hassle of carrying banknotes.The international airport in Bhairahawa is also waiting for commercial operation.Ek Narayan Aryal, secretary at the home ministry, inaugurated the integrated checkpoint on Wednesday amid a ceremony. He said that Rupandehi had started an excellent work.“We have taken tourism as a basis for the country’s prosperity. We are willing to welcome as many tourists as possible, but the environment also needs to be conducive,” said Aryal.Aryal underscored the need for such a system nationwide. “Expanding such facilities to all border points will create an easy environment for tourists.”“The ministry will do what is necessary to expand such a facility nationwide.” Indian tourist flow has increased in destinations like Pokhara, Chitwan, Kathmandu and Lumbini. Nepal and India share 1,800 km of border points.Khel Raj Pandey, mayor of Butwal Sub-metropolitan City, said creating a tourist-friendly environment was essential. “We complain about why tourists are not coming, but we don’t do anything to facilitate their visit.”“Tourists need to be provided with hassle-free services.”Istiyaq Ahmed Khan, mayor of Siddharthanagar municipality, said many tourists travelling to Nepal using private vehicles complain about the limitation on carrying currency.“We have demanded that the home secretary allow Indian tourists to carry at least Rs200,000.” Currently, Indians entering Nepal are not allowed to carry more than INR25,000. Lawmakers have also urged the government to remove restrictions on the amount of currency Indian tourists can use while visiting Nepal.Krishna Prasad Sharma, president of Lumbini Chambers of Commerce and Industry, said that the cash-carrying limitation by Indian tourists needs to be removed. “We want to bring as many tourists as possible to the country but also restrict them from spending here,” he said. “It’s a ridiculous policy.”India is Nepal's top tourism source market. In 2023, over 300,000 Indian tourists entered Nepal via air transport.However, the overland Indian visitors’ survey conducted in 2017 by the Nepal Tourism Board showed that 1.36 million Indian tourists travelled to Nepal through the surface route.The number may be even more significant now.Though the issue in Belahiya has been settled, tourism entrepreneurs said Indian tourists entering from the Jamunaha border point of Nepalgunj, Banke, also face similar hassles.After getting customs clearance, Indian vehicles need to visit another checkpoint to obtain a route permit. Since most Indian tourists come to Nepal in private cars, getting route permits can be problematic.Thakurdwara, a tourist centre in Bardiya, also has many Indian tourists.But complaints about that point are also galore. The checks on the highways are frequent and tiresome, even after they have completed all formalities at the customs point.Travel trade entrepreneurs say the security personnel's behaviour towards the Indian tourists is strange. \nPrime Minister KP Sharma Oli will go for a floor test on Sunday, barely a week after taking the oath of office.Oli, who was sworn into the top executive position by President Ramchandra Paudel on Monday, decided to go for the test earlier than expected “in order to execute his work plan more confidently,” said Mahesh Bartuala, chief whip of the Oli-led CPN-UML. He has also been assigned to coordinate among the ruling parties on parliamentary matters.Oli, as the parliamentary party leader of the UML, had appointed Bartuala as chief whip of the ruling party as per the party charter. The prime minister consulted ministers and party leaders before deciding to schedule the floor test.After taking the vote of confidence, Oli plans to address the nation the same day, highlighting the objectives and priorities of the new government.On the same day, a hearing on a writ petition challenging his appointment is due at the Supreme Court.Advocates Deepak Adhikari, Khagendra Prasad Chapagain and Shailendra Kumar Gupta filed the petition on Monday seeking a mandamus order to annul the appointment for being unconstitutional.The petitioners argue that the President must call for the formation of a new government under Article 76(3) after the one formed under Article 76(2) fails to secure a vote of confidence.The Office of the President, the federal parliament secretariat, Nepali Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba and Prime Minister Oli are among the defendants named in the petition.Govinda Prasad Ghimire, information officer at the Supreme Court, said a preliminary hearing on the petition has been scheduled for July 21.The prime minister will address the nation and take part in a question-answer session in the House, said Bartuala. In order to expedite his works, the prime minister is gaining the confidence of majority parliamentarians as soon as possible, he added.Oli was appointed prime minister as per Article 76(2) of the constitution, and the prime minister thus appointed must take the vote of confidence within 30 days. Article 76(2) states that in cases where no party has a clear majority in the House, the President shall appoint as prime minister “a member of the House who can command a majority with the support of two or more parties”. As per Article 76(3), the President appoints the parliamentary party leader of the largest party the prime minister. The leader then has to seek a vote of confidence within 30 days.Ahead of the vote, Oli, who aims for the support of more than two thirds of House members, is going to meet the leaders of several fringe parties, including Rajendra Lingden of the Rastriya Prajatantra Party, Upendra Yadav of the Janata Samajbadi Party, and CK Raut of the Janamat Party.Though both Yadav and Raut are positive about extending support to Oli, the RPP is still undecided, said a UML leader. Since the ruling Nepali Congress and UML, the two largest parties in the House of Representatives, have already extended support to the chief minister of Madhesh Province, a Janamat Party member, “we expect the party to vote for Oli on Sunday,” said the UML leader. Yadav’s position has yet to be known.Oli is certain to secure a majority in favour of his trust motion. On Sunday, he was appointed prime minister on the basis of the signatures collected from 166 lawmakers. The prime minister needs at least 138 votes in the 275-member House to retain his position. Oli, along with 21 Cabinet ministers, took the oath of office on Monday. This is Oli’s fourth stint as the country’s chief executive. First appointed the prime minister in October 2015 (until August 2016), Oli was head of the government from February 2018 to May 2021 and from May 2021 to July 2021.Meanwhile, Prime Minister Oli has started appointing his secretariat members. Rajesh Bajracharya is the chief personal assistant to the prime minister. He has been working closely with Oli for over a decade.After the vote of confidence, the prime minister is planning to appoint more advisers and members of his private secretariat. These include chief political adviser, foreign relations adviser and press adviser. Bishnu Rimal is said to return as the chief political adviser. Rimal also served Oli in the same capacity earlier.On Wednesday, on the recommendation of the prime minister, President Paudel appointed senior advocate Ramesh Badal as the new attorney general.Oli had entrusted Badal to negotiate with Congress leaders before the two parties signed a seven-point deal on July 1. Earlier, Badal served in the Oli government as attorney general from March 19, 2021 to July 13, 2021.According to the Office of the President, Badal was appointed to the position as per Article 157(2) of the constitution. The attorney general is the government’s chief legal adviser. Dinmani Pokharel, who was appointed attorney general by the Pushpa Kamal Dahal-led government in December 2022, had resigned on Tuesday. His resignation followed the customary tradition of the legal adviser quitting with the change in government. Pokharel had courted controversy for issuing a letter to then deputy prime minister and home minister Rabi Lamichhane, stating that no cases had been filed against him in the cooperatives fraud case. \nFormer US President Donald Trump has returned from the jaws of death, albeit with a chipped ear, after he suffered a gunshot at a rally in Pennsylvania. Coming on the heels of a poor performance in the first televised live debate by his opposition presidential candidate Joe Biden, the attack has helped the controversial Republican politician consolidate his vote bank. Luckily for him, he could raise his fist and chant “Fight, fight, fight” before being frisked away by Secret Service agents, bettering his chances of returning to the White House as undecided voters seem to buy his arguments about a plot against America. Violence against a candidate at the cusp of election only generates sympathy for them; having seen death up-close, Trump is now eyeing a resurrection of his political career.But no debate in the social media age follows the straight dichotomy of good versus evil or victim versus perpetrator. Taking cue from Trump’s own modus operandi of creating what he calls “alternative facts,” conspiracy theorists and some of his detractors have been calling the attack a plot by Trump himself to gain public sympathy. An old photo of him, with both his ears intact, has been doing the rounds on the internet, claiming that he was not injured at all. After all, this is the same man who was indicted for instigating an attack on Capitol Hill and trying to overturn the 2020 US presidential election results. From investigating crimes by him to now investigating a crime against him, US law enforcement and investigation agencies have an unexpected, rather strange, task in their hands.But amid the din of which of the old men returns to the White House as the 47th president of the United States of America or the motive of the 20-year-old Republican voter-turned-gunman or even the misgivings about Trump’s victimhood, an age-old question of gun culture has made a comeback. American gun culture has a central role in the assassination attempt on Trump, and Trump himself is one of the fiercest defenders of such a culture. And if anyone thinks Trump will now rethink his love for guns, one of his advisers, Chris LaCivita, has clarified that the ex-president will continue to protect gun rights. For the Republicans, the constitutional guarantee offered by the Second Amendment for individuals to carry guns is sacrosanct; Trump will potentially continue to exploit the Americans’ emotional attachment to the gun as a self-defense instrument.Such is the gun obsession in the United States, even after seeing the assassination of four presidents—Abraham Lincoln, James A. Garfield, William McKinley and John F. Kennedy—and assassination attempts on Gerald Ford, Ronald Reagan, Bill Clinton and George W Bush, among others, the country is helpless to do much about it. The comfort of amnesia is too dear to America when it comes to dealing with the tough question of gun violence. And with a morally repugnant record of supplying arms to Israel in its attempts to wipe out the Palestinians, Trump’s opponent and sitting president Joe Biden is lost for words. The United States should really unite to wipe out gun culture. \nThe second Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation (BIMSTEC) Foreign Ministers’ retreat was held in Delhi on July 11-12. This was when the BIMSTEC initiative slowed down, with each country having other priorities. Many saw BIMSTEC as an alternative to SAARC, as the regional organisation was revived as a cooperation vehicle in the Eastern part of South Asia. It now has a Secretary General with a Secretariat based in Dhaka and adopted a charter only recently, even though the organisation came into existence in 1997. Yet efforts are being made for regular meetings and dialogues among the officials of states to take the initiative forward and make progress on the 14 priority areas.Pushing the agenda forwardSince 2023, the BIMSTEC Foreign Ministers’ retreat has become a regular event. Founded in 1997, the organisation held its fifth summit in Colombo in March 2022, where the charter was adopted after more than 20 years. This reflects the lack of commitment of member countries to take the process forward. While India sees BIMSTEC as a vehicle for its Act East policy to engage with South East Asia and as a gateway for the South Asian region, Myanmar and Thailand’s expectations are limited as they are already a part of ASEAN. Bangladesh, which has projected itself as the hub of connectivity and has a Look East policy, is also the lead country for connectivity projects and has been an active member of the group. For Nepal and Bhutan, BIMSTEC acts as a forum to improve their foreign policy interests and provide these countries with access to the sea through multiple countries within a regional framework. The BIMSTEC region brings together 167 billion people, incorporating 22 percent of the world population and a combined GDP of $3.71 trillion. India and BIMSTECWhile the organisation moves slowly, ironing out differences between member states to establish seamless trade and connectivity, India has prioritised BIMSTEC in its foreign policy—from BIMSTEC outreach in the BRICS meeting that India hosted at Goa to inviting the BIMSTEC leaders to attend the swearing-in of Prime Minister Modi’s government in 2019. India hosted the first meeting of the BIMSTEC Energy Centre governing board in Bengaluru in 2023 to suggest a road map for meaningful intra-BIMSTEC cooperation, among other issues. India is the lead country in BIMSTEC, collaborating in transport and communication. For India, BIMSTEC promises to connect its North-East terrain to the growing regional markets in South-East Asia. It promises connectivity and access to the port in the North-East region. While regional connectivity within the BIMSTEC framework is taking time to fructify, India is already working within the sub-regional and bilateral frameworks. For example, its effort to establish connectivity with Bangladesh would go a long way as a building block for BIMSTEC connectivity. It is similarly engaged with both Nepal and Bhutan to build road, rail, waterways and grid connectivity.It is speaking of the land bridge with Sri Lanka and underwater cables, as well as the restart of ferry services with Myanmar. It is engaged in the Kaladan multimodal project and has access to Sittwe Port, inaugurated in May 2023 and has been operationalised. The trilateral highway promises to link India to Thailand through Myanmar. After the Arakan Army captured the Paletwa township near the Mizoram border, the road project of nearly 110 km connecting Peletwa to Zorinpui at Mizoram will be in cold store for some time. The Arakan Army has said they would want the project to continue and harness mutual benefit; India is closely watching the situation. It has completed 70 percent of the trilateral highway, but the security situation in the Sagaing Region of Myanmar has not allowed the completion of the project. Once built, this project will help the BIMSTEC member states.Transport, connectivity and tradeEnabling the environment to conduct trade remains a priority. The Framework Agreement on the BIMSTEC Free Trade Area (FTA) was signed on February 8, 2004, but has yet to conclude an FTA. There have been discussions to remove tariff and non-tariff barriers, rule of origin, standardise trade and progressively move towards including the service sector. A BIMSTEC Trade Negotiating Committee (TNC) has been formed. The BIMSTEC Trade Facilitation Strategic Framework 2030 points out, “India and Thailand have the most advanced facilitation environment in the region, followed by Bangladesh, Myanmar, and Sri Lanka”, emphasising a structured pathway to enhance regional trade.Transport and electricity grid connectivity among the members of the Bangladesh-Bhutan-India-Nepal subregion would constitute a significant building bloc, leading to the advancement of some of the BIMSTEC agenda. In 2022, the member states adopted BIMSTEC's Master Plan for Transport Connectivity and are planning to establish a ‘Coastal Shipping ecosystem, of port facilities, of ferry services in the Bay of Bengal, as also power grid interconnectivity and a regional motor vehicles agreement’. According to BIMSTEC energy outlook 2035, between 2014 and 2019, the energy supply in the region has grown at an average rate of 10.72 percent.BIMSTEC was once touted as an alternative to SAARC, even though the geographical spread of member countries is different. The Bay of Bengal, part of the Indian Ocean, remains a primary focus area of the BIMSTEC countries. The potential for sea-borne trade with the cheapest transportation cost remains attractive, given the instability in Myanmar. The first meeting of the working group on coastal shipping discussed the agreement in November 2017. A consensus on the agreement has yet to arrive. Coastal shipping agreements already exist between India and Bangladesh. India is already using Sittwe port in Myanmar under a bilateral arrangement. Vishakhapatnam port is now open to Nepal for its external trade. An MoU was signed between the Port Authority of Thailand to use Ranong Port in Western Thailand and the Port Trusts of Visakhapatnam, Kolkata and Chennai in 2019 during the BIMSTEC Conclave of Ports.Security CooperationExternal powers are showing increasing interest in the Bay of Bengal region. China is already building a port in Myanmar to access the Bay of Bengal through Myanmar. There is an increasing interest of the US in this region as a part of its Indo-Pacific strategy.Combating international terrorism, transnational crime and drug trafficking remains a major concern in this region because of the Golden Triangle. The situation in Myanmar has also added to this concern.The Tri-Services HADR PANEX series of exercises among the BIMSTEC countries also enhances individual countries’ capacity to deal with natural calamities and other challenges at home. National security adviser-level meetings also facilitate dialogue between the member countries on the security challenges that the region faces. These meetings also complement the Colombo Security Conclave, which discusses security issues among the Indian Ocean littorals. Intra-regional tourism can be increased through visa liberalisation, which will also contribute to people-to-people contact.The second Foreign Ministers’ retreat in Delhi is essential to take the process forward. However, given the slow progress, BIMSTEC has yet to make its mark. There are several bilateral disputes between the member countries, but those have never posed a challenge to cooperation, as seen in the SAARC context. The pace of the summit meeting has acquired gravitas. Thailand is going to host the sixth summit in September. Given the region’s economic and trade potential, it is expected that the leaders of member countries rise to the occasion to make the cooperation in Eastern South Asia a grand success. \nWhen the Indonesian monsoon arrived in November 2023, Nahale, 52, began planting corn in her field. A woman farmer with a disability, she relied on rainwater as a primary water source. The rain abruptly ceased, however, causing the plants to wither and perish. Nahale lost all her seeds and suffered significant economic losses. Unaware that climate change was the culprit behind these unpredictable weather patterns, she continued with her usual planting schedule. But unlike previous seasons, the rain came at different intervals, leading to devastating crop failure. People with disabilities, specifically women and older people, are often disproportionately affected by the impacts of climate change. There are around 1.3 billion people in the world with disabilities. Approximately 23.3 million are in Indonesia. Climate change is already having a severe impact on Indonesia’s economy. Agriculture, fisheries, water supply and healthcare are all affected.In 2024, the estimated financial loss so far was around 115.53 trillion Rupiah (upward of $US7 billion), with more significant losses expected. Climate change has caused prolonged droughts and reduced water availability in many parts of Indonesia, particularly Eastern Indonesia. In East Nusa Tenggara, the water availability is as low as 1,098.08 m3/capita/year, affecting more than 5 million people in the province.Water insecurityClimate change drives water and food insecurity, particularly affecting vulnerable communities. Crucially, women face extreme difficulties in accessing water for household needs, agriculture and livestock. Droughts exacerbate the challenge as it becomes increasingly difficult for women to find sufficient water sources to fulfil these essential requirements. These conditions have profoundly affected the agricultural sector with multiple crop failures due to shifting weather patterns and water scarcity. El Nino worsened conditions, further challenging East Nusa Tenggara’s vulnerable agricultural sector. This puts farmers into financial stress. Disabled farmers, like Nahale, are especially vulnerable, along with women generally and the elderly.Their incomes have seen a considerable decline, leading to increased debts and interest payments to banks or cooperatives. As the family head, with the responsibility of providing for their families’ needs, Nahale and other women with disabilities or elderly women who face similar situations have limited time to take care of their own well-being, leading to health insecurities.Nona, Nabaga and NabungaTake the case of Nona, a 47-year-old woman with a disability and a member of a minority tribe. After the death of her husband, who was the primary breadwinner, she was left with three children to support. She then became a motorbike taxi rider to drop passengers from her village to the cities. However, Nona’s job was affected by climate change because of the rapid shift in weather patterns, she could not go out to deliver her service to her customers because of sudden rain during the day. This puts her family in economic hardship because of income loss.To survive, she had to develop her cooking skills and sought assistance from a cooperative to access credit for starting a small catering business. However, this puts her in a debt situation. Nona's journey reflects how individuals like her must adapt and find alternative ways to make a living amid the effects of climate change.The strategy of increasing women's economic empowerment through diversification of livelihood becomes important to counter the adverse effects of climate change.Nabaga, a 76-year-old female farmer with physical disability, also has experienced crop failure and turned to IKAT weaving to make ends meet. However, Nabaga faces challenges in marketing her IKAT weaving products and needs support in accessing broader markets to ensure viable sales.Extreme weather events caused by climate change hamper the ability of the disabled, older people and women, to access healthcare. Nabunga, 70, from Kupang, with a mental disability, is unable to receive crucial health services. Her name is not listed in the government-based data as a person with disability who is eligible to receive social aid and health services, which puts her at heightened risk and increases her vulnerability during disasters caused by climate change. She finds solace and assistance from the supportive community around her and church. Hers is not an isolated case.Government intervention is vital to provide these vulnerable women with essential social protection and welfare support. The Indonesian government ratified the Paris Agreement—a legally binding international treaty that serves as a guideline for nations to address and reduce climate change impacts—in 2016 to significantly show its commitment to adapt, mitigate and develop its climate goals as part of global climate actions.However, climate change-related planning, policy-making and actions have not adequately considered the overlaps between climate change, disabilities, age, gender and social inclusion. The detrimental impact on most vulnerable community members is the lack of necessary support to cope effectively with climate change's effects. The government could consider the connections between climate change, disabilities, gender, age and social inclusion in its planning processes to achieve meaningful participation and ensure the protection of society's most vulnerable members.Women such as Nahale, Nona, Nabaga and Nabunga are vulnerable because they face related challenges brought on by climate change. The government could empower these women and millions like them by providing essential social protection and welfare support.Considering multiple, overlapping factors can help avoid exacerbating their multiple vulnerabilities due to climate change. These considerations will pave the way for a more comprehensive and inclusive approach to climate change adaptation and mitigation efforts. This approach will achieve three objectives: Enhance the marginalised community's resilience, foster a more equitable and sustainable response to climate change and achieve the sustainable development goals.Ultimately, the approach will enable policies and actions to address different vulnerable communities' specific needs and challenges in Eastern Indonesia. -360info \nAfter the formation of the federal Cabinet on Monday, Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli has been criticised for not being inclusive while constituting the team of the country’s highest executive. In his 22-member Council of Ministers, Oli picked only two women while he didn’t choose a single Dalit member. There are a few things for which even those from developed countries praise Nepal and in which we Nepalis can take great pride. The inclusive constitution of Nepal promulgated in 2015 and the laws formulated in line with the charter are quite progressive. Dalits, women and other oppressed communities fought long for their representation. But it was after the success of the people’s movement in 2006 that the enforcement of inclusive policy in state agencies started to be strengthened. And the constitution formally institutionalised the achievements of the political and other movements.Unfortunately, the spirit is gradually dying. It’s not only Oli who has ignored the call for inclusivity in his Cabinet. The same trend had been in evidence in the past. The immediate past prime minister and CPN (Maoist Centre) chair Pushpa Kamal Dahal, who often boasts of introducing an inclusive system in the country, didn’t appoint a single minister from the Dalit community in his last Cabinet. This is a serious concern. Having a progressive constitution and laws doesn’t mean much if the leaders in the driving seats of the executive agencies trample on its spirit. If there is a community that is most discriminated against, it is the Dalits and they therefore deserve priority for representation under an inclusive system. Worryingly, leaders not only disregard the constitutional spirit but don’t follow even minimum criteria while picking ministers, lawmakers or other officials for important posts. Aspirants for ministerial berths rather often resort to various shenanigans to impress top leaders, promoting unhealthy practices in politics. We urge the prime minister to try to correct this egregious mistake in the days ahead.The new prime minister has also stood out for something positive though. He was quick to form a full-fledged Cabinet. In the past, prime ministers would initially appoint a few ministers and take weeks, if not months, to give the Cabinet a full shape. The factional feuds within the prime minister’s party for ministerial berths and bickering between coalition partners over power sharing would frustrate the public. The heads of the government would oversee a dozen ministries, hampering the government’s functioning. Prime Minister Oli’s appointment of all his team members on the day of swearing-in means the government can function in a full-fledged way from day one. Also, in his first Cabinet meeting on Monday, Oli gave ministers specific deadlines to accomplish given tasks. Unlike in the previous Cabinets, Oli has also chosen more experienced ministers in his team.Prime Minister Oli and Nepali Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba are among the senior-most leaders who have been in power on and off since the restoration of democracy in 1990. Deuba was home minister in the first post-1990 government and Oli succeeded Deuba in 1994. They know how things work at Singhadurbar. The Congress and UML leaders have given various rationales for the coming together of the two largest parties in the federal parliament. If they can make a mark in governance and service delivery, they would have gone a long way towards fulfilling their promises.  \nThe weather across the country is forecast to be partly to generally cloudy on Thursday.Light to moderate rain accompanied by thunder and lightning is expected in several parts of Koshi Province, Bagmati Province, Karnali Province and Gandaki Province, as well as at one or two places in the rest of the provinces.The meteorological forecasting division has warned of heavy rainfall in some parts of Koshi, Bagmati and Sudur Paschim provinces.Tonight, the weather is expected to remain generally cloudy throughout the country.Likewise, moderate rain with thunder and lightning is likely to occur at some places in Koshi Province, Bagmati Province, Gandaki Province, Karnali Province and Sudur Pashchim Province, as well as at one or two places in the rest of the provinces.Heavy rainfall is expected at one or two places in Koshi, Madhesh, Gandaki and Sudur Pashchim provinces.The maximum temperature on Tuesday was recorded at 36.3 degrees Celsius in Dhangadi, while Jomsom’s lowest recorded temperature was 15.5 degrees Celsius. \nSunaina Rana is a classical Hatha Yoga teacher and a spiritual seeker. She completed her Isha Hatha Yoga teacher training in 2015 and has since dedicated her time to providing yoga classes in India and Nepal. She also volunteers at the Isha Yoga Center in Tamil Nadu, India, founded by Sadhguru. As part of Sadhguru’s foundation, Rana resonates with their mission to raise human consciousness and establish spiritual infrastructure globally, fostering spiritual growth and well-being for all. Rana is currently in Nepal and will provide Hatha yoga classes in Kupondole Heights, Sanepa, from the end of July until the end of September. In this conversation with the Post’s Sanskriti Pokharel, Rana discusses the role of books in her spiritual journey, factors that drew her towards yoga and takeaways from volunteering at the Isha yoga centre. Which books have had the most impact on your practice of yoga?As a Hatha yoga teacher and spiritual seeker, the most profound impact of yoga comes from consistent daily practice.Books have also been instrumental in offering inspiration and motivation. Some of the books which have helped me are ‘Mystic Musings’ by Sadhguru, ‘Life and Death’ by Jiddu Krishnamurti, ‘Awareness’ by Osho and ‘Jonathan Livingston Seagull’ by Richard Bach. Does yoga help in day-to-day life and emotional well-being? Yoga has played a tremendous role in my day-to-day life. It has helped me manage stress and anxiety. For example, if a situation upsets and angers me, my perspective completely shifts after a yoga session. As a result, I feel much more settled and balanced.What pulled you towards yoga and spirituality? Since childhood, I have been connected to prayer, chanting the Hanuman Chalisa before bed as my nightly ritual. However, in my late teenage years, I began to feel disconnected from these prayers. I wanted to understand more and uncover the science behind such chants.Nine years ago, when I aspired to go to the US to pursue my master’s, my body felt sluggish and stagnant due to a lack of physical exercise. I wanted to change that as I did not feel good in my body.The health benefits of yoga attracted me to it. Additionally, I came across marketing videos of the five-month Hatha yoga teacher training on social media, and the trainees' experiences with the teacher captivated me. I decided to start a new spiritual journey by enrolling in the Hatha yoga teacher training certified by Isha Hatha School of Yoga.After completing the transformative five-month journey, I participated in several advanced three-day programs and a more intensive seven-day Samyama silence program with Sadhguru.During the Samyama silence program, I experienced profound spiritual dimensions that touched me and revealed that life could be experienced beyond the body and mind. This realisation led me to pursue the path of a full-time spiritual seeker and dedicate my life to Sadhguru’s mission of spreading meditation and yoga worldwide.How do you counter the stream of thoughts during your sadhana practice? When I began my sadhana nine years ago, my mind was flooded with incessant thoughts, like an explosion. Today, while I still have thoughts during sadhana, they have significantly diminished, and the experience of bliss and meditation is much stronger.Because of my consistent practice, my thoughts have reduced and are less disturbing. I’ve noticed that the more persistent and dedicated I am to my sadhana, the better I manage the stream of thoughts. How has reading contributed to your development as a spiritual seeker?Whenever I lack motivation and inspiration, I turn to books. For a seeker like me, reading offers diverse perspectives and reminds me of the importance of being aware, conscious, and balanced.In moments when my emotions are out of control and when negativity threatens to consume me, I turn to transformative books like ‘Inner Engineering’ and ‘Mystic Musings’ by Sadhguru. These books give me wisdom and knowledge, guiding me to clarity and stability.What is one major takeaway from your volunteering experience at the main office of Isha Foundation in Coimbatore, Tamil Nadu?It's been nearly a decade since I volunteered at the Isha Foundation. I find it an incredibly unique way of approaching life—a special and noble path to self-transformation.Witnessing thousands of individuals enter deep states of meditation is profoundly touching. Being part of this journey, where I gradually become free from my compulsions and see others striving for the same, has been a significant takeaway for me.Living in the ashram teaches us to transcend our likes and dislikes. By minimising the focus on our individual preferences, we learn to respond to situations based on their requirements rather than our desires.This approach is crucial because it shifts our focus from ourselves to the demands of the present moment. It's not an easy path to follow, but with conscious practice, we gradually become less bound by our identity and gain the flexibility to adapt to any situation.I haven't fully mastered this yet, but this lesson holds immense significance in my spiritual journey and remains one of the most valuable lessons I learned at the Isha Foundation.Sunaina Rana’s book recommendationsDeath: An Inside StoryAuthor: Sadhguru Publisher: Penguin AnandaYear: 2020This book eased my fear of death, both my own and that of loved ones, breaking its taboo for me.

But they have yet to win a single match in the competition. In both editions, they finished the group stage winless and at the bottom of the table.However, Nepal could change that bitter history when they face the UAE in the tournament opener.“Our first target is to defeat the UAE,” Nepal skipper Indu Barma said. But the task will be a difficult one.The UAE are making their second appearance at the Asia Cup. But under captain Esha Oza, they have emerged as the strongest side among the associated nations.The UAE qualified for the Asia Cup as the winners of the ACC Premier Cup in February. Nepal initially failed to make the Asia Cup but was later included in the main event as one of the two semi-finalists—the other being Thailand—following the expansion of the tournament to eight teams by the Asian Cricket Council.Two years ago, the UAE and Nepal crossed paths in the ACC T20 Women’s Championship semi-finals. The UAE progressed to the final ahead of Nepal due to a superior net run rate in the group stage after their match yielded no result due to rain. The UAE went on to defeat Malaysia in the final to make their Asia Cup debut.In the 2023 ICC Women's T20 World Cup Asia Qualifier as well, the match between Nepal and the UAE was abandoned due to rain. However, the UAE finished the group on top and ahead of Nepal due to net run rate. Both the UAE and Nepal progressed to the knockouts as the top two teams. Nepal fell to Thailand in the semis but UAE won the tournament and progressed to the global qualifier (2024 ICC Women's T20 World Cup Qualifier).The UAE also had a blistering run in the T20 World Cup qualifier but ultimately failed in their mission to make their T20 World Cup debut after they were undone by Sri Lanka in the semi-finals.Nepal may have received a boost in their confidence when they defeated Sri Lanka Development Squad in the final and third T20 practice match to avoid series sweep, but their recent form suggests that UAE will still be heavily favoured.According to Barma, if Nepal defeat the UAE, their next goal will be trying to pull off an upset against the big teams and reach the semi-finals.But things are not as easy as it seems.Nepal next play Pakistan, who were runners-up in both editions Nepal participated, next Sunday and cricket’s powerhouse India on July 23.In the 2016 edition, when all six participating teams were in a single group, Pakistan had bundled Nepal for 47 runs before winning the match by nine wickets.Nepal were also humiliated by India in their next group match when the Indians wrapped up Nepal for just 21 runs to win by 99 runs. Nepal were chasing 121.India have won seven out of eight editions of the Asia Cup since its inauguration in 2004. Bangladesh won 2018 edition defeating India by three wickets.Rubina Chhetri, who is now Nepal’s most capped women’s cricketer with 55 appearances in the national team, and Sita Rana Magar were both in Nepal’s squad in 2016.But Rana Magar hopes Nepal women’s team will be a lot better this time as they have also drawn inspiration from the men's team who recently participated in the T20 World Cup.“Our plan is not just to participate in the tournament. We have a feeling that our team can play a good game against big teams like our men’s team,” said Rana Magar.“We have gained clarity on how to bat for a full 20 overs and how to bowl the ball through mentoring. There are positive changes in the team.”Former captain Chhetri is in fine form. The batting allrounder has scored 741 runs from 46 innings for Nepal and will bring inspiration to Asia Cup from her outstanding Premier Cup when she scored an unbeaten 118 against the Maldives in their record total of 227-4 to become Nepal’s first player to score a century in women’s T20Is. Chhetri is also the first Nepali player to score a century in women’s T20Is.Chhetri, who scored 17 (17), 28 (43) and 37 (26) in three warm-up matches against Sri Lanka, will form the core of Nepal’s batting unit alongside Barma and Rana Magar.Pacer Kabita Joshi also impressed with the ball in the warm-up, while Sabnam Rai and Kritika Marasini will lead the spin threat for Nepal. \nUS President Joe Biden, under pressure from fellow Democrats to drop his re-election campaign, tested positive for Covid-19 while visiting Las Vegas on Wednesday and is self-isolating after experiencing mild symptoms, the White House said.White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre announced the positive test for the 81-year-old Democrat after Biden cancelled a speech due to the diagnosis.“He is vaccinated and boosted and experiencing mild symptoms,” Jean-Pierre said.As he boarded Air Force One to depart Las Vegas to recuperate in Delaware, Biden told reporters: “Good, I feel good.” But he climbed the stairs slowly, holding the railing tightly and pausing a few steps in and again towards the top.The illness comes at a crucial time for Biden, who has been losing ground in battleground states against Republican Donald Trump, who is headlining a triumphant convention this week after he survived an assassination attempt on Saturday. The White House said Biden planned to spend a long weekend at his Delaware beach house. It was unclear how long the sickness would keep him for the campaign trail.Minutes after the announcement, the president’s motorcade was on the move to the Las Vegas airport after taping a radio interview in the city.Biden had greeted a couple of dozen people at a Mexican restaurant prior to going into the radio interview. He was running late to deliver a speech to Latino civil rights group UnidosUS when the organizer, Janet Murguia, announced he had tested positive for Covid.There were groans in the conference room at the news.“He said to tell my folks that we’re not going to get rid of him that quickly, we’re going to have a chance to hear from him in the future directly,” Murguia said.Biden, who had spent two nights in Vegas on the campaign trail, is locked in a battle with some fellow Democrats who worry he is too old to seek re-election and want him to step aside in favor of another candidate.He has been defiant in the face of the calls to quit the race, telling one interviewer that only the “Lord Almighty” could persuade him to go.“He will be returning to Delaware where he will self-isolate and will continue to carry out all of his duties fully during that time,” said Jean-Pierre.Biden suffered a blow earlier on Wednesday when a prominent Democratic member of the US House of Representatives, Adam Schiff of California, said it was time for him to “pass the torch” to someone else.Some 40% of Democratic registered voters said Biden should drop his reelection bid, in a Reuters/Ipsos poll concluded on Tuesday. Some 65% of independent registered voters agreed with them.Some 58% of Democratic registered voters told the poll they believed Biden is too old to work in government - 70% of independent registered voters agreed.The White House cited Biden’s doctor as saying he had been suffering from upper respiratory symptoms earlier in the afternoon.“He felt OK for his first event of the day, but given that he was not feeling better, point of care testing for Covid-19 was conducted and the results were positive for the Covid-19 virus,” the statement said.The White House said Biden will be self-isolating in accordance with Centres for Disease Control guidelines.His symptoms are mild and he has received an initial dose of Paxlovid, the doctor said.Biden’s last bout with Covid began in July 2022. He tested positive on July 21, recovered on July 27, tested positive with a rebound case on July 30 and was finally cleared on August 7. \nGermany will halve military aid to Ukraine in 2025 despite ongoing conflict and concerns over Republican candidate Trump's potential return, relying on Group of Seven loans and depleted military stocks.\nPresident Paudel appointed Ramesh Badal as the new Attorney General on Wednesday, replacing Dinmani Pokharel who resigned after the formation of a new government.\nThe Nepali Embassy in Dhaka has issued an advisory for Nepali students studying in Bangladesh regarding their safety in light of the recent protests across the country.Earlier today, the Bangladeshi government announced indefinite shutdowns of all public and private universities after student protests against a quota system for government jobs turned deadly this week, leaving at least six people dead and scores injured.The embassy urged students to stay indoors and obey the instructions of their respective university and college administrations.“The students are also requested to contact the embassy in case the administrators ask them to move to safer places or if the situation at their current accommodation is unsafe,” the notice reads.The embassy also said that they are closely monitoring the situation and are in constant contact with concerned government agencies and college administrative bodies for the safety of Nepali students.Contacts to reach the embassyYojana Bamjan, second secretary at the Nepali Embassy in Dhaka: +8801880691013Riya Chhetri: +8801745407958 \nNepal's imports from China surged 34.8% in the past fiscal year, driven by electric vehicles, while imports from India declined 3.1% due to export curbs, resulting in an 1.8% drop in Nepal's total imports despite a rise in informal cross-border trade with India.\nThe National Human Rights Commission advocates for expanding the Enforced Disappearances Enquiry, Truth and Reconciliation Commission Act to encompass war crimes, crimes against humanity, and child soldier issues, while ensuring justice for victims and reduced sentencing for cooperating perpetrators.\nIn the 1980s, Mohan Bikram Singh's split from Nirmal Lama led to a decade-long Maoist conflict under Pushpa Kamal Dahal, who became Prime Minister in 2022 but now faces an impending downfall due to waning popularity and electoral system reforms.\nThe International Monetary Fund (IMF) has warned that Nepal’s economy, still reeling from subdued domestic demand and post‑pandemic balance sheet repairs, may face an increasingly gloomy and uncertain outlook, mainly due to fragile political stability and cooperatives failure.The global lender, which provides policy advice and financing to its members to foster growth and financial stability, said Nepal’s fragile political stability could disrupt policy continuity and reform implementation. Nepal is set to elect the new prime minister next week. Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal is almost certain to fail the trust vote. This will be his fifth trust vote in a year and a half. The CPN-UML withdrew its support to the government on July 3 after it ditched its coalition with the CPN (Maoist Centre) and joined hands with the Nepali Congress to form a new government.This is the fourth time in Nepal’s political history that two major parties are forming a government without a powerful opposition, which observers say weakens democracy's effective functioning.On Tuesday, the IMF completed the fourth review under its four‑year extended credit facility, allowing Nepal to withdraw $41.3 million to help the country's economic recovery.This brings total disbursements under the extended credit facility for budget support to $247.7 million.The IMF executive board approved the extended credit facility arrangement for Nepal on January 12, 2022. The approved amount totals $371.6 million, which is 180 percent of Nepal’s special drawing rights quota (SDR) of 282.42 million.“Nepal’s economy continues to face challenges,” said the statement issued by the IMF on Thursday. It said that Nepal’s growth projected at 3 percent in the fiscal year 2023-24 remains below potential due to subdued domestic demand and post‑pandemic balance sheet repairs. The IMF has talked about Nepal’s cooperatives sector for the first time.In the statement, the IMF warned about the intensification of financial sector vulnerabilities, such as a further rise in non-performing loans. In this context, “more failures of cooperative lenders could endanger the banking system's soundness,” the IMF said.According to experts and bankers interviewed by the Post, cooperatives, which the government once embraced as one of the three pillars of the economy, are now threatening the economy.In Nepal, millions of small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are heavily involved in cooperatives, and their failure could not only damage the fragile economy, but also harm social harmony, say experts. Cooperatives are involved in sectors ranging from dairy and livestock to tailoring and retail.Recently, thousands of victims of cooperatives fraud have staged protests in various parts of the country, demanding the return of deposits embezzled by cooperative operators. Hundreds of such depositors came to Kathmandu and staged protests. The government recently signed an agreement with them, promising to solve their problems as soon as possible.“The problem in the cooperative sector will shake up the banking sector. But if there is a wise move, the banking sector can absorb the shock,” said Upendra Poudyal, president of the Confederation of Banks and Financial Institutions Nepal. He said that the regulation of cooperatives has already been delayed. “We have seen that cooperatives are being operated for personal gains. A limited number of people took the benefit.” “Now, the central bank should begin with a single threshold. Limit the number and start supervision.” As of mid-March, there are 31,450 cooperatives in Nepal, with 7.38 million members. The deposit mobilisation in cooperatives amounted to Rs478 billion, while credit mobilisation stood at Rs405 billion. They currently employ 94,000 people.In a recent interview, Kashi Raj Dahal, immediate past chairman of the Crisis-ridden Cooperatives Management Committee, a government agency, told the Post that globally, most cooperatives work in productive sectors like food production, dairy, fruits and other agricultural activities. “But in Nepal, around 25,000 cooperatives are involved only in financial activities, mainly collecting deposits and issuing loans. Such cooperatives are now in crisis. Over 15,000 are registered to collect deposits. Even others registered as multi-purpose cooperatives primarily engage in savings and credits. Around 500 cooperatives are currently in trouble.”The Dahal-led government has promised the return of at least Rs500,000 to each depositor by recovering it from the directors' assets. Yet doubts persist about whether depositors will get back their money. Some economists have warned about potential mass protests if the cooperatives issue is not taken seriously.The IMF has also warned that the failure to raise the execution rate of large-scale projects would deprive the economy of much-needed stimulus and weigh on growth. On the pessimistic side, the IMF said that economic activity is expected to increase, reaching 4.9 percent in 2024-25, supported by more robust domestic demand. The statement reads that the cautiously accommodative monetary policy stance, the planned increase in capital expenditures in the 2024-25 budget, additional hydropower generation, and a continued rise in tourist arrivals are expected to boost domestic demand and growth. Inflation is expected to remain within the Nepal Rastra Bank’s (NRB) target ceiling of 5.5 percent.“Nepal has made important strides on its economic reform agenda. Decisive actions in monetary policy, bank regulation and rolling off Covid support policies played a major role in overcoming urgent balance of payments pressure in 2021-22,” said Bo Li, deputy managing director of IMF. “Reserves continue to rise without the need to use distortive import restrictions. Despite revenue shortfalls, fiscal discipline was maintained in 2022-23 and 2023-24. Bank supervision and regulation have improved by rolling out new supervisory information systems. Nepal’s medium-term outlook remains favourable as strategic investments in infrastructure, especially in the energy sector, are expected to support potential growth.”The IMF said that strengthening public investment management would support the needed boost to capital spending. Enhancing fiscal transparency will help contain fiscal risks and strengthen medium-term fiscal sustainability.“As monetary policy transmission is still weak in a context of balance sheet repair, a cautious and data-dependent monetary policy remains appropriate to preserve price and external stability,” the IMF said.  \nHe is known for his nationalist legacy, marked by the amendment of Nepal's map to include territories like Kalapani, Lipulekh, and Limpiyadhura, and his strong stance against India, especially during and after the 2015 Nepal blockade.But how did he rise to become the country's powerful man? \nPyakuryal holds a Phd in Public Affairs from the University of Akron, US. In this interview, they discuss Nepal’s elusive political stability, the narratives governing Nepali politics, the role of patriarchy, and the trends in Nepali politics Pyakuryal will be closely following in the years ahead. \n\n\nPushpa Kamal Dahal, the chairman of CPN (Maoist Centre) and the immediate past prime minister, was accused of causing a split in the Janata Samajbadi Party Nepal (JSP-Nepal), one of his coalition partners.JSP-Nepal was not only a coalition partner in the Dahal government but also one of the founding members of the Socialist Front Nepal, which was established on July 8, 2023, amid a special function in Kathmandu.Dahal’s Maoist Centre, the CPN (Unified Socialist), led by Madhav Kumar Nepal, JSP-Nepal of Upendra Yadav and Nepal Communist Party of Netra Bikram Chand ‘Biplab’ had come together to form the Front.As leaders held a meeting of the Front at the office of Unified Socialist on Tuesday, Yadav remained conspicuously absent. Meanwhile, Mahindra Raya Yadav of Nepal Sanghiya Samajbadi Party attended the meeting as the new entrant of the Front.The JSP-Nepal chief boycotted the meeting as he held a serious grudge against Dahal. Former prime minister Dahal is not only accused of masterminding the split of JSP-Nepal but is also blamed for weakening the Socialist Front while in power.Soon after the party split, JSP-Nepal chair Upendra Yadav questioned the Front's relevance. Janata Samajbadi Party, formed by a splinter faction of JSP-Nepal, however, has not joined the Front. The new outfit, which is led by Ashok Rai, has seven lawmakers in the federal parliament while the mother party led by Yadav has five.CPN (Unified Socialist) leader and National Assembly lawmaker Beduram Bhusal, however, claims there is no ground to accuse Dahal. “It is true that despite being a member of the Front, member parties have taken arbitrary decisions favourable to their party,” Bhusal told the Post. “But this does not mean that Dahal had tried to foil the Front.”Agni Sapkota, the Maoist Centre leader who attended the Front’s meeting on Tuesday, told the Post that the members, who had met after a hiatus, took stock of the changed political scenario.“At the meeting, we concluded that the Congress-UML alliance can undermine the achievements in the name of constitution amendment, though their agreement is yet to be made public,” Sapkota told the Post. “We have decided to critically analyse every move of the newly formed government.”Tuesday's meeting of the Front also constituted a four-member task force to review the Front’s journey and suggest a way forward. The task force consists of Khadga Bishwakarma from Chand’ party, Ganga Narayan Shrestha from Nepal Samajbadi Party, Pramesh Hamal from Unified Socialist and Dev Gurung from Maoist Centre. They have been given a 15-day timeframe to submit their report.Meanwhile, detractors question the Front’s relevance. Manish Kumar Suman, a JSP-Nepal leader, said that the relevance of the Socialist Front ended after Dahal publicly accepted playing a role to split the JSP-Nepal. “Dahal is trying to activate the Front out of desperation after being ousted from power,” Suman said.Soon after the JSP-Nepal split on May 5, Dahal, while speaking at a function of his party, had said he would do anything to remain in power, indicating his role in the party split. The JSP-Nepal was split on the pretext that some lawmakers from JSP-Nepal and Unified Socialist were approaching the then main opposition Nepali Congress to form a government while both the fringe parties were in the Dahal government.But Bhusal said that the JSP-Nepal leaders might have provided such harsh assessment of the Front as they were in pain of party division, which is natural.Socialist Front was formed with a spirit to strengthen collaboration between the left-leaning political parties. But Dahal used it for his political gain, Suman accused. “Only after being ousted from the government did Dahal try to activate the Socialist Front,” he said.Dahal was ousted from the government after he failed to win the parliament’s trust after his coalition’s largest partner, the CPN-UML, reached a deal with Nepali Congress on July 1 to form the new government.The Front was formed after years of discussion among some left-leaning political parties. However, Baburam Bhattarai, a longtime advocate of the socialist front, was later left out. Instead of Bhattarai, the Netra Bikram Chand ‘Biplav'-led Communist Party of Nepal was inducted into the bloc.When formed last year, the Socialist Front had 54 members in Parliament. The Maoist Centre was the largest among them, with 32 seats, followed by JSP-Nepal, with 12 seats at the time, and Unified Socialist’s 10 seats. But now the Front only has 43 members, including Mahindra Raya Yadav, the chair of Nepal Sanghiya Samajbadi Party. Bhusal, the Unified Socialist vice-chair, argued that the number of lawmakers does not affect the Front’s functioning. “The Front was established to strengthen collaboration between the like-minded left-leaning parties so it has nothing to do with the Parliamentary affairs,” Bhusal said.The primary concept paper of the alliance says that the Socialist Front was established with “a basic commitment to federalism, democracy, republicanism, inclusion, and secularism—the five basic key features of the Constitution of Nepal.” Though the Front vowed to release the detailed concept later, it has yet to do so.The primary concept paper released during the inauguration on July 8 last year also states ‘amending the constitution’ as one of its objectives. However, the Maoist Centre, the leading force of the Socialist Front, is criticising the Congress-UML coalition government for including the constitutional amendment as one of its objectives.But Maoist Centre leaders claimed the constitution amendment mentioned in their concept paper is different from what the Congress-UML alliance is trying to do.“It is true that the primary concept paper released by Front last year also mentions the constitution amendment, but it is with the forward looking approach, but the objective of the Congress-UML alliance is different,” Sapkota argued. “We suspect they want to abolish the Proportional Representation system from the electoral system apart from other achievements, which would be a regressive move. We won’t let it happen.”Krishna Pokharel, a professor of political science, echoed Sapkota. “The Socialist Front was advocating for enriching the constitution and making it more progressive by amending it, but the objective of the Congress-UML alliance is different,” Pokharel said.Dahal harped on the idea of forming the Socialist Front after the dissolution of the Nepal Communist Party, considered to be the most powerful communist force in Nepal’s history, in early 2021.During a meeting held on March 22, the Front's member parties decided to try to get the CPN-UML, the largest communist party, on board the Socialist Front. They floated the idea as Dahal at the time ditched the Congress and brought the UML on board the ruling coalition.Now with the UML ditching the Maoist Centre and forming the government with Congress, the chances of their participation in the Front has ended for now. But then, the UML, the country’s largest communist party, was never so positive about the idea of forming Socialist Front. \nPrime Minister KP Oli has instructed his ministers to set deadlines for their work and bring about visible changes within a month.Addressing the first Cabinet meeting on Monday after taking oath of office and secrecy from President Ramchandra Paudel, Oli urged his cabinet colleagues to work with urgency.Along with Oli, other 21 cabinet ministers also took oath of office and secrecy on Monday at a function at the President Office.“The prime minister clearly instructed us to achieve visible change and show concrete results within one month,” said Prithvi Subba Gurung, Minister for Communication and Information.The Cabinet meeting also appointed Minister Gurung as government spokesperson. But the government has decided to make public the Cabinet decisions only after 24 hours.Besides urging his Cabinet colleagues to demonstrate results within a month, the prime minister stressed the need for the government to instill hope within six months that the government is doing a good job. The prime minister also called for visible improvements across all indicators within one year, while urging ministers to enhance coordination.Gurung announced the government’s new policy of not releasing Cabinet decisions immediately. Earlier, decisions were made public soon after each Cabinet meeting.Successive governments have adopted different approaches about releasing Cabinet decisions.“Cabinet decisions will be kept confidential for 24 hours. Since we have set the rule, neither the prime minister, nor ministers can disclose them before that. Why should we immediately publicise what we are doing? It is your responsibility to learn about it after 24 hours. If we release information prematurely, that will go against our policy of confidentiality,” said Gurung after the Cabinet meeting.“If anything requires to be made public immediately, it will be announced after the Cabinet’s decision,” said Gurung.The meeting also decided to upgrade the Kirtipur-based cricket ground to a stadium, Prime Minister Oli announced on his Facebook account, adding that the construction would be completed within 300 days.The new stadium in Kirtipur will feature state-of-art amenities such as parapets for spectators, floodlights for night games, among other things and will be completed within the 300 days, Oli wrote on Facebook. Despite cricket’s growing popularity in Nepal, inadequate infrastructure has affected both players’ confidence and spectators’ enjoyment of the game. Similarly, the Cabinet also decided to compensate family members if a member goes missing and remains unlocated for ten days, with an equal amount provided for a deceased person.Minister Gurung clarified that this compensation applies mainly to people missing in landslides, floods and other natural calamities where bodies are not found within ten days. And the compensation for those injured in such disasters will be different.“This is a new decision,” said Gurung. “But in the previous guidelines, those who go missing in natural calamities were not compensated.” The meeting also entrusted Liladevi Gadtaula as acting chief secretary until a new chief secretary is appointed. This is for the first time that the government has appointed a woman as acting chief secretary. \nNewly appointed foreign minister Arzu Rana has said that boundary disputes should be resolved through facts and evidence, avoiding unnecessary conflicts with neighbouring countries.While taking charge of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Monday, Rana, the country’s fourth foreign minister, said unlike in the past, it is no longer necessary to take decisions on boundary issues solely based on the inspection of border pillars.“We will resolve the boundary dispute with India based on geography, history and new scientific maps prepared on the basis of the global positioning system [GPS]. We have more information, facts and evidence now than in the past, so there is no need to bicker over which boundary pillar was where,” Rana told reporters after assuming the office of foreign minister. “The facts are there, so we can resolve all our border issues,” she said. “As per my briefing, the Mahakali serves as a border river, and both countries [Nepal and India] have access to it, so there is always a dispute.” “This is a transboundary issue, which we must clearly understand. Hopefully, something will happen in our lifetime. Resolution to the problem will be found on the basis of geography, history and GPS. There’s no magic solution. As I said, we are in a delicate geopolitical location so must act very carefully. We have survived as a nation for a long time, and need to continue to do so, not just for today or tomorrow, but for thousands of years,” said Rana. Prior to Rana, three women, namely Bimala Rai Poudyal, Sujata Koirala, and Sahana Pradhan, had taken charge of the foreign ministry.Rana, the spouse of Nepali Congress chief and former prime minister Sher Bahadur Deuba, has worn several hats in the past, including experience in social fields and parliamentary affairs. Nepal has a longstanding boundary dispute with India, and ongoing issues with China. Due to the lack of joint inspection since 2006, officials do not have records of such disputes on the northern border.“Regarding Kalapani, Limpiyadhura and Lipulek, we can sit with India and reach a resolution,” said the foreign minister, who will face daunting foreign policy challenges in the rapidly changing geopolitical landscape. On the first day of her office, the minister was asked how she would address boundary issues with India. She said geopolitics is a complex issue, and she does not rely on magic to resolve such disputes.She described her new role as “historic” and said she would use the opportunity in a constructive way.Rana stressed the importance of preserving Nepal’s legacy of never being colonised. “Ours is a small, landlocked country situated between two giants, so we have to maintain balanced relations with all,” she added. “Our ancestors have protected our country throughout history. The legacy must be upheld for generations to come.” Rana also stated that she plans to focus on executing economic diplomacy and implementing international treaties, agreements and commitments. Also, she committed to secure the repatriation of Nepali youths serving in the Russian Army, and to initiating efforts for the safe release of Bipin Joshi, who is believed to be in Hamas captivity since October 7 last year. \nCPN-UML chair KP Sharma Oli was sworn in as the prime minister of Nepal for the fourth time amid a function at the President’s Office in Sheetal Niwas on Monday. President Ramchandra Paudel administered the oath of office and secrecy to Prime Minister Oli. President Paudel on Sunday had appointed Oli as the prime minister under Article 76 (2) of the constitution as there were no other claimants for the post. After CPN (Maoist Centre) chair Pushpa Kamal Dahal, the immediate past prime minister, was unable to secure the trust of the House of Representatives during a floor test on Friday, President Paudel had invited political parties to form a new government under Article 76 (2) of the constitution on the same evening, setting a Sunday deadline for submitting claims at the President’s Office.With no other contender, Oli had in his support submitted the signatures of 166 lawmakers (Nepali Congress’ 88 and UML’s 78). The minimum number needed to form a government is 138 in the 275-strong House of Representatives.Soon after the swearing-in ceremony on Monday, Prime Minister Oli formed a full 22-member Cabinet, including two deputy prime ministers. Among the 22 members including the prime minister, 10 are from the Congress, while nine represent the UML. The other parties in the Cabinet are the Janata Samajabadi Party (JSP), led by Ashok Rai, and Loktantrik Samajbadi Party (LSP), which have two and one ministries, respectively. Shortly after Oli’s swearing-in, President Paudel also administered the oath of office and secrecy to the newly appointed ministers. Based on Article 76 (9) of the constitution, President Paudel, on the recommendation of the prime minister, administered the oath of office and secrecy to the ministers.Article 76 (9) stipulates that the President shall, on the recommendation of the prime minister, constitute the Council of Ministers comprising a maximum of 25 ministers, including the prime minister, in accordance with the inclusive principle from among the members of federal Parliament.Despite the Article based on which the prime minister recommended the ministers clearly stating that the council of ministers should be in line with the inclusive principle, that is not the case.In the 25-member council of ministers, Prime Minister Oli can still appoint three ministers.“The prime minister still can appoint three full Cabinet ministers or ministers of state to fulfil the requirement enshrined by the constitution for the council of ministers,” Purnaman Shakya, a professor of constitutional law, told the Post. “But ministers of state can only participate in Cabinet meetings in the absence of their line ministers.”In Monday’s Cabinet, Prakash Man Singh of the Congress and Bishnu Prasad Paudel of the UML were inducted as deputy prime ministers. They will also head the Ministry of Urban Development and the Ministry of Finance, respectively.In the 22-member Cabinet formed under Oli’s leadership, there are only two women. There is no representation from the Dalit and Muslim communities.In the 22-member Cabinet, 13 are from the Khas Arya community, and there are three members from Janajati and five from Madheshi communities.Nepal has incorporated proportional representation and inclusion as integral parts of the constitution. This was done to prevent the overrepresentation of one community at the policy-making level. But the country has failed to abide by its charter.“What an irony! Not a single Dalit get a berth in the new Cabinet formed by the so-called champions of inclusive democracy,” Lokraj Baral, a professor of political science, wrote on social media.Likewise, Bhimarjun Acharya, a constitutional expert, also questioned the new Cabinet's inclusiveness.“Everyone did a lot of politics in the name of Dalits, and the communists even more so. Dalits were not given any place in yesterday’s government led by Pushpa Kamal Dahal nor in today’s government led by Oli,” Acharya wrote on social media. “I request that Dalits be represented in the Council of Ministers immediately.” When the Post questioned Dalit members of the Congress and the UML parties, they said they were not the right people to comment on the issue.As per the National Population and Housing Census 2021, 13.2 percent of the national population are Dalits while Muslims comprise 4.86 percent of the population.Yet Dalit activists find fault with this silent approach. It is precisely because the Dalit politicians do not strongly raise the issue of their inclusion that this trend prevails, they say.“There are a few other reasons why Dalits are sidelined from mainstream politics. One is because of a weakened Dalit movement,” Purna Darnal, a Dalit activist, told the Post. “When the Maoist Centre, a political party that championed inclusiveness in Nepali politics, refused to be inclusive in the Cabinet formed in their leadership, why would other parties do so?”Darnal added that it is a matter of shame that the two biggest parties in the country practice such blatant exclusion while choosing ministers.Nine of the 10 ministers from the Congress are male. When dividing them into clusters, seven are Khas Arya, and one each are Janajati, Tharu and Madheshi.Likewise, eight of the nine ministers of UML are male. Six are from the Khas Arya community, two are Janajati, and one is a Madheshi. \nAs CPN-UML chairperson KP Sharma Oli becomes the country’s prime minister for the fourth time, he also carries a chequered history from his previous terms as the country’s chief executive.When he first took the seat at Singha Durbar in October 2015, wresting it from Sushil Koirala, violent protests were rife in the Tarai/Madhesh region in the wake of the promulgation of the Constitution of Nepal. The situation had been more difficult due to India’s blockade. A few months into Oli’s tenure, the southern neighbour withdrew its blockade while the constitution was amended to address the concerns of the agitating communities. Though the Madhesh-based parties boycotted voting on the constitution amendment, it had partially addressed the concerns of the dissenting groups. His government also signed a historic Trade and Transit Agreement with China, ending Nepal’s sole dependence on India for third-country trade.Oli’s nationalist graph as prime minister for 10 months between October 2015 to August 2016 went up so high that his CPN-UML not only emerged the largest party from the 2017 election but was very close to the majority mark on its own. When Oli moved into Baluwatar for the second time in February 2018, he had an even stronger electoral mandate. After a merger with the CPN (Maoist Centre) two months later, the Nepal Communist Party that he jointly led with Pushpa Kamal Dahal enjoyed a near two-thirds majority in the House of Representatives. Oli’s prime ministership started with high hopes and excitement as he was leading a majority government for the first time in around two decades. As Oli was set to lead the government for a full five-year term, the hope was that decades of political instability would end, the constitution would be implemented and the federal system strengthened. The expectations, however, were short-lived. Oli started demonstrating his authoritarian streak right after taking charge as the executive head. He brought the National Intelligence Department, the Department of Revenue Investigation and the Department of Money Laundering under the purview of the Prime Minister’s Office.His intolerance for dissent became apparent when he banned protests at Maitighar, near Singha Durbar, the government’s seat. His government then prepared a slew of bills aiming to muzzle the media, curtail freedom of expression and shrink civic space. He had contested the elections by selling big dreams—railway connecting China, Nepal’s own ship in the high seas, and distribution of gas through pipelines, among other things. But none of these dreams even came close to fruition. Having realised he had failed to deliver as promised even two years after coming to power, he played another nationalist card—amending the constitution to show Kalapani, Lipulekh and Limpiyadhura in Nepal’s map—which his predecessors never dared to do. While it has been registered as a historic move in the country, it antagonised New Delhi.Oli’s unilateral style of running government and leading the party forced Pushpa Kamal Dahal and Madhav Kumar Nepal to ally against him, leading to a split in the Nepal Communist Party. After failing to keep the NCP united, Oli tried to dissolve the House—twice in under six months.His decision to trample on the constitution to stay in led to his humiliating exit from the government. He was ousted by the Supreme Court. Political analysts say Oli has a historic opportunity to right the previous wrongs. “The Congress-UML alliance has generated high hopes and provides an opportunity for Oli to correct his past mistakes,” Uddhab Pyakurel, who teaches political sociology at Kathmandu University, told the Post. “However, Oli’s recent statements [on House dissolution] show he is still not in the mood for course correction. He has no regrets about his wrongdoings.”Oli has repeatedly defended his move to dissolve the House even until last month. The Congress-UML alliance stands on the foundation for stability. But how can the person who couldn’t give stability even when he commanded a majority government ensure stable government now, says Pyakurel. “Trust in the new government will be low as the parties have kept secret even the agreement that led to its formation,” he says.However, some analysts say it would not be easy for the incumbent not to deliver. “There is a strong voice within both the Congress and the UML that it is futile to form a government that cannot deliver. So the pressure to perform will come from both the ruling alliance as well as the opposition,” says Sanjeev Humagain, who teaches PhD students in politics and international relations at Tribhuvan University.“The Congress-UML coalition has the political capital needed to deliver. The bureaucracy too will find it difficult not to cooperate with the government of two major forces. I see a positive environment for delivery.” \nIn a bid to prevent garbage from piling up on streets during the monsoon, the Kathmandu Metropolitan City has deployed heavy equipment including bulldozers, excavators, and loaders, to clear the road to the landfill site. Officials said the move aims to ensure smooth transfer of waste as roads to the landfill often become impassable during the monsoon, preventing the passage of garbage trucks.“We have deployed three excavators, two bulldozers and two loaders to clear landslide debris along the road to the Bancharedanda landfill,” said Rabinman Shrestha, chief of the Environment Department at the metropolis. “Also, we have kept five more vehicles on standby for immediate deployment if needed.”Every year, during monsoon season, the road to landfill sites gets obstructed in multiple places, obstructing the transfer of house waste collected in the three districts of the capital city—Kathmandu, Lalitpur, and Bhaktapur. Apart from these, some local levels of Kavrepalanchok also discard garbage at the landfill site at Bancharedanda.The metropolis officials said that they had purchased 10 high-pressure pumps to drain floodwaters from inundated settlements.“Five pumps have already been sent to the high-risk areas along riversides,” said Shrestha. “These can quickly pump away floodwaters.”The city office started repairing the Sisdole road leading to the Bancharedanda landfill in Nuwakot district just a few weeks before the start of the monsoon. Officials said Rs30 million had been allocated for repairs, which included fixing potholes, concreting roads, and other works.Around 200 metres of road near the Sisdole area, which is often damaged by garbage trucks and excavators, will be concretised, according to officials.Besides monsoon-induced road obstructions, garbage disposal is sometimes disrupted due to obstructions by the residents living in settlements near and around the landfill site. These obstructions cause weeks-long halt to door-to-door garbage collection, leading people in the Valley to discard their trash on streets.Officials said that a high-pressure pump is being used to prevent the overflow of leachate from the dumping ground.Landfill leachate is a hazardous liquid containing harmful bacteria, chemicals and other components. It forms when rainwater passes through a landfill or when organic matter decomposes naturally.Officials say the leachate needs to be re-injected into the landfill, which quickens the decomposition process of the landfill waste and prevents the liquid from flowing into the river. The City office has also started segregating degradable and bio-non-degradable waste materials from households in its seven wards. Wards 5, 7, 10, 12, 24 and 27 have been segregating the waste materials generated in the households. The city office has also arranged separate trucks for collecting segregated waste materials from the households.Degradable waste materials are being turned into compost at the KMC’s waste transfer station. Officials said that the metropolis has also been using reagents to expedite the compost-making process.The city office recently sold non-degradable waste worth Rs700,000.Waste segregation at the source was one of the measures Mayor Balendra Shah touted as a solution to Kathmandu’s chronic garbage problem. After he assumed office, Shah asked city residents to start segregating waste at the source. They started doing so, using separate bins in their homes. But the plan didn’t work, largely due to a lack of preparations on the KMC’s part.The Kathmandu Valley generates over 1,200 tonnes of solid waste every day, nearly 60 percent of which comes from the KMC alone. Experts say 60 percent of organic waste originating in the Valley can be converted into compost and the remaining 30 percent of non-degradable waste can be recycled. \nIn a bid to lessen the spread of the dengue virus during the ongoing monsoon season, the Kathmandu Metropolitan City has decided to continue the drive to destroy mosquito larvae and breeding grounds. Officials at the health department of the city office said on Friday that they have just completed a week-long drive in all 32 wards of the metropolis and plan to continue these efforts in the coming days as well.“Every Wednesday, our health volunteers will visit households and open spaces to destroy mosquito breeding grounds,” said Rishi Bhusal, epidemic prevention and control focal person at the metropolis. “Decisions on preventive measures including launching search and destroy drives will depend on the spread of virus and intensity of rainfall in the coming days.”Dengue is a viral disease transmitted by female Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes. The same vectors also transmit chikungunya, yellow fever, and Zika virus, according to the World Health Organisation.According to data provided by the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division, at least 1,268 people from 72 districts have been infected with the dengue virus since January this year. Among the 72 districts that reported dengue outbreaks, Kathmandu has the highest number of cases: 141. Public health experts say reported cases could be just the tip of the iceberg, as around 80 percent of those infected are asymptomatic. Many people infected with dengue show mild symptoms and can be treated with paracetamol at home.Dengue symptoms include mild to high fever, severe muscle pain, rashes, severe headache, and pain in the eyes. Patients with these symptoms are advised to seek immediate treatment. While there is no specific cure for the disease, early detection and proper medical care can prevent death.Nepal reported its first dengue case in a foreigner in 2004 in the Chitwan district. Since then, an increasing number of dengue infections have been reported from many districts, including major dengue outbreaks. Last year, at least 20 persons died, and more than 52,000 were infected by the virus, which had spread to all 77 districts.In 2022, a total of 88 people died, and over 54,000 were infected by the virus across the country. During that period, hospitals in the Kathmandu Valley were overwhelmed with dengue patients, and pharmacies ran out of paracetamol, the most widely used medicine to treat fever.In 2019, the disease killed at least six people and more than 16,000 were hospitalised across the country. The virus had spread to 68 districts at the time.Though the post-monsoon period is considered the dengue epidemic season, the deadly disease has already become endemic in Nepal, as outbreaks of the virus are reported every month, including in the winter months.Officials at the health department said that 654 health workers, including female community health volunteers, were deployed in the week-long campaign, which concluded on Friday.“Volunteers and health workers who were deployed to the door-to-door campaign checked the mosquito breeding grounds and the larvae, made people aware about the risks and destroyed the breeding grounds,” said Bhusal. Health workers reported that storage places for scrap materials, discarded cups, and plastic in open spaces, and unused lands as potential hotspots for the dengue virus in the coming days. Health workers have warned owners of these sites that action will be taken if mosquito larvae are found against the owner of the storage place if mosquito larvae were found.Dengue-transmitting mosquitoes breed in clean water and bite people in daylight. Uncovered water tanks and discarded objects, such as plastic cups and bottles, could be breeding grounds for these mosquitoes.Public health experts say now is the right time to prepare for and prevent possible outbreaks. Health ministry officials said they have alerted all related agencies to the risk of a dengue outbreak. \nThe Kathmandu Metropolitan City has imparted mental health screening training to doctors and paramedics serving at urban health promotion centres.Officials at the Health Department in the metropolis hope that the move will help hundreds of patients with mental health issues in the city to get timely treatment.“Getting free treatment for mental health problems comes under the right to get free basic health care services,” said Sajina Maharjan, acting head of the department. “Mental health problem screening training to doctors and paramedics will help in the timely diagnosis of the problems and start of early treatment.”At least 32 doctors serving at the urban health promotion centres under the city office and dozens of paramedics participated in five-day screening training. The metropolis has upgraded its urban health clinics to urban health promotion centres and started providing services through medical doctors. “Due to the lack of doctors at our urban health promotion centres, patients suffering from mental health problems have been deprived of timely treatment,” said Nali Bajracharya, a senior public health officer at the department. “Now patients having mental health issues and seeking care at our health centres will also get mental health treatment.”Though neither the federal government agency nor the city office has data on the number of people suffering from mental health problems in the metropolis, doctors estimated that a lot of people could be suffering from various forms of mental health problems—anxiety, depression and others.Officials say that they are also planning to provide free medication to patients with mental health problems.Health workers say that many city dwellers, despite having mental health problems, do not seek treatment and instead turn to drugs and substances to cope. Due to the entrenched social stigma, fear of discrimination and other factors, many patients in Nepal do not talk about their mental health issues.The general tendency among people to conceal mental health issues due to the stigma attached to it has also forced patients to opt for substance abuse, doctors say.They say that while drugs and alcohol may provide temporary relief from stress, they are not a solution and can adversely affect mental health and well-being in the long run.“Treatment in the initial stage of mental illness helps patients achieve better results. For that, early diagnosis is crucial,” said Dr Pomawati Thapa, chief of the Non-communicable Disease and Mental Health Section at the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division. “Other local units should also follow the initiative to provide mental health screening training to health workers, including doctors.”Nepal is among the countries with highest rates of suicide, which is an extreme manifestation of a mental health problem.According to Nepal Police data, 6,993 people took their own lives in the fiscal year 2022-2023. This accounts for more than 19 deaths on average daily. Fifty-six percent of those who die by suicide are men.Doctors say that people do not attempt suicide for a single reason, but due to a complex situation arising from multiple problems.An increasing number of people are struggling with mental problems owing to the rising cost of living and the struggle to manage even their most basic needs, such as food, housing, healthcare and jobs, experts say.Whatever the cause, suicides and suicide attempts have a ripple effect, impacting families, friends, colleagues, communities and societies, doctors say.A study carried out by the Nepal Health Research Council in the past shows that about 13 percent of Nepalis suffer from some form of mental disorder. This means around one in eight Nepalis has mental health issues. Moreover, the country simply does not have enough experts to treat mental health problems, it added.Studies show the magnitude of suffering, the burden and costs for individuals, families and societies arising from mental health disorders are alarming in Nepal.“No doubt, mental health problems have been emerging as a major cause of morbidity and mortality in our country,” said Thapa. “All local governments must take initiative to address the problems. Only the federal government agencies cannot do much.”The World Health Organisation says that one in four people in the world has been affected by mental or neurological disorders at some point in their lives, and around 450 million people currently suffer from such conditions, placing mental disorders among the leading causes of ill health and disability worldwide. \nDuring the 2022 local level election, people of Kathmandu elected independent candidate Balendra Shah as their mayor for five years. Sunita Dangol of the CPN-UML secured the position of KMC deputy mayor in the same election. When they began their term, many suspected that the two—an independent mayor and his party-affiliated deputy—wouldn’t have cordial relations. But, in the last two years of their term, there has been no visible disagreement between them. They proved their sceptics wrong.Deputy Mayor Dangol kept mum when Mayor Shah accused her party chair, KP Sharma Oli, of policy corruption in the Giri Bandhu Tea Estate land scam.Moreover, Shah expressed his anger on June 3 over the government’s intervention in his plan to widen pavements in the New Road area. Deputy Prime Minister Raghubir Mahaseth of the UML leads the Ministry of Physical Infrastructure and Transport, which maintains major roads.After the ministry intervened in the municipal plan to expand the sidewalk on New Road, Shah took to social media and wrote, “Honourable KP Oli jyu, don’t hoodwink people by engineering yet another scam to hide a scam of Rs10,000 crore [Rs100 billion].”He further added, “You have reassured those who had made advance payments to buy land of Giri Bandhu Tea Estate that they would get the land within two years.” “If one looks at the policy corruption in the tea estate, it appears not a single leaf would stir without Oli’s nod,” Shah wrote.A few days prior to the incident, Mayor Shah had engaged in a heated debate with Chinkaji Maharjan, a UML member and chairman of KMC’s ward 22, over the sidewalk expansion plan.Dangol remained quiet on the issue thus far. However, at the city council meeting on Monday, which also discussed KMC's policies and programmes for the fiscal year 2024-25, she criticised Mayor Shah for his remarks.“This should be the first time the deputy mayor opposed the public behavior and statement of the mayor,” a Kathmandu ward chairperson told the Post on the condition of anonymity.Dangol had her initial plan to contest the mayor position independently but the UML gave her the deputy mayor’s ticket.Speaking during the Monday discussion, Deputy Mayor Dangol said, addressing Mayor Shah, “Your and mine voices are being heard and watched by Nepalis worldwide. Therefore, those of us who want to come to politics should think about our expression,” Dangol remarked. “We should maintain the image and dignity of the institution we represent.”She also emphasised the need to accommodate the voices of everyone in an undertaking.Though the representatives of Kathmandu Metropolitan City claim that Dangol's Monday statement was unusual, they deny any rift between the two leaders of the local government. “City council’s is an internal meeting of the KMC where various issues arise. We settle those issues internally,” Nabin Manandhar, the KMC spokesperson and ward 17 chairman from the Nepali Congress, told the Post. “Having an opinion does not necessarily mean criticism.”Rajesh Kumar Shrestha, chair of KMC ward 19, seconded Manandhar.However, local representatives of Kathmandu have been questioning Shah for his ‘lone-wolf’ manner of leading the institution.“We should develop a working relationship that welcomes everyone’s spirit,” Dangol told the council meeting. “If one thinks they are in a position and everything should be done as they say, it will only lead to trouble.”She added, “While working in a team, we definitely have a different opinion, but different opinions should be respected.”At the meeting, referring to Mayor Shah's past statements, council member Anita Karki asked him, saying, “What if the voters of Kathmandu set ablaze the Durbar where the KMC office lies?”In September last year, when the traffic police obstructed a KMC vehicle, later known to be used by his postpartum wife, Mayor Shah provocatively wrote on Facebook, threatening to burn Singha Durbar, the federal government’s central secretariat.Traffic police, under the federal government, had stopped the vehicle to check necessary documents on a Saturday.After the incident, Shah wrote on social media warning that if the government blocked KMC's vehicles again, he would set fire to Singha Durbar.Dangol said on Monday that she believed it was wrong to write on social media or make a statement inciting people to burn the Singha Durbar or the Bagh Durbar, where the KMC office is situated.Dangol, speaking at the city council meeting, also said there should be no polarisation between the representatives who were elected to develop Kathmandu. \nAD CLUB, a dynamic and autonomous entity under the Advertising Association of Nepal (AAN), hosted a successful networking event on July 12 to mark the establishment of its new board. AD CLUB is a hub for advertising and marketing professionals, a vital platform for individuals and organisations within the advertising and marketing communication landscape.

Chintamani Neupane, chairman of Siddhartha Hospitality Group and Kabindra Dhoj Joshi, CEO of Muktinath Capital, signed the agreement on behalf of their respective organisations.Siddhartha International Hotel Limited operates the luxurious Siddhartha Boutique Hotel in Baudha and the Siddhartha Vilasa in Bhairahawa. Siddhartha Hospitality oversees more than two dozen companies, including Siddhartha Vilasa (five-star), Siddhartha Vaibhav (four-star), and Siddhartha Vatika (three-star), along with ventures in hospitality education, restaurants, cottages, cafes, agricultural farms, trading, and IT services. \nThe International Monetary Fund (IMF) has inserted a separate annex on savings and credit cooperatives in its staff country report, flagging a risk to Nepal’s economy that could trigger social unrest if the ongoing problems are not sorted out.It said that several cooperatives have collapsed in the past six months, causing a loss or freezing of client savings and creating small-scale social unrest. The international financial institution released the full text of the IMF staff country report on Tuesday. It warned that problems in the savings and cooperatives sector are expanding.The main cause of the failure is investment in illiquid and underperforming assets of cooperatives, which impact repayment capacity, combined with some cases of fraud.The IMF said in the statement that a combination of large data gaps, weak governance, unsound credit and liquidity risk management, and a lack of licensing, effective regulation, monitoring, and supervision resulted in the failure and closure of multiple cooperatives.On May 28, the lower house formed a seven-member parliamentary committee to investigate cooperatives fraud.Immediate past home minister Rabi Lamichhane, who is also president of Rastriya Swatantra Party, has been accused of embezzling millions of rupees from multiple cooperatives while he headed the Gorkha Media Network before entering politics.The IMF said that authorities need a comprehensive strategy to deal with the issues in cooperatives.It said that over 14,000 cooperatives hold an estimated Rs478 billion of savings deposits, one-twelfth the size of banking sector deposits as of June 2023.“There is an increasing risk of negative spillovers to other cooperatives and the smallest regulated banks,” the IMF said. On Tuesday, a delegation of the Central Cooperatives and Poverty Alleviation Department of the ruling CPN-UML submitted a 12-point suggestion to the newly appointed minister for Land Management, Cooperatives and Poverty Alleviation, Balaram Adhikari. “We have suggested ensuring that depositors’ money is safe in cooperatives,” said Khagraj Adhikari, chief of the department and former chief minister of Gandaki Province. “We have demanded immediate action against the people involved in the irregularities and cooperatives fraud.” He said the cooperatives, which can be established as a strong economic pillar, need major reforms. The delegation has recommended forming a high-level, powerful task force to address the issues in the sector. The erstwhile Pushpa Kamal Dahal-led government, on May 28, while unveiling the budget for 2024-25, had promised to return at least Rs500,000 to each depositor by recovering it from the directors’ assets. Yet doubts persist over whether depositors will get their money back.Some economists have warned about potential mass protests if the cooperatives issue is not resolved soon.The IMF has recommended a strategy of central coordination of the 761 district and provincial cooperatives regulators to facilitate the cleanup of the problematic cooperatives. It said that reforms in the supervisory and regulatory architecture are needed. “Given likely limited resources, this strategy needs to ensure that the largest financially sound cooperatives remain stable and are appropriately regulated while dealing with problematic cooperatives.”Nepal has a large and vibrant cooperative sector regulated by many agencies. There are around 32,000 registered cooperatives. In addition to cooperatives, which focus on providing savings and loan services, cooperatives are active in areas such as agriculture, forestry and several other activities. These non-financial cooperatives can allocate up to 30 percent of their activities to savings and loan services. According to the IMF, there are more than 14,000 cooperatives and around 10,000 non-financial cooperatives that also provide financial services. As of June 2023, cooperatives held Rs478 billion in savings deposits and Rs426 billion in assets. Cooperatives are regulated based on their geographical scope—at the federal, provincial, or local level. As a result, there are a maximum of 761 different regulators. If a cooperative is declared problematic, the relevant regulator must appoint a Problematic Cooperatives Asset Management Committee. Since mid-2023, pressures in the Nepali cooperatives have been mounting. Gauri Bahadur Karki, former chair of the Special Court and the head of an inquiry commission formed in 2013 to investigate troubled saving and credit cooperatives, told the Post last year that cooperatives were in trouble after the government halted plotting of land in 2022. “Most cooperatives’ operation model involves investing in land and paying interest after generating profits from selling such land. With the government abruptly halting plotting, many cooperatives failed to sell the land, which resulted in their failure to pay promised interest, and the depositors who could not recover their money had to stage protests.”According to Karki, other problems included investing in land and misappropriation of funds by the cooperatives’ promoters.The IMF said that the Department of Land Management, Cooperatives and Poverty Alleviation, and subnational authorities are reportedly declaring an increasing number of cooperatives problematic, implying the need for decisive intervention to prevent further contagion. The IMF has recommended three kinds of steps to deal with the issue: immediate steps, near-term steps (within one year), and medium-term steps (1-2 years).In the immediate steps, the IMF has recommended halting the registration of new cooperatives. The current registration does not provide the same scrutiny as licensing, and adequate supervision is not currently guaranteed. It said a temporary stop on registering new cooperatives at federal, provincial, and local levels until the issues have been addressed and the licensing and supervisory process and capacity have been improved would be appropriate. “Resolution options in the strategy should follow the existing legal framework and could focus on liquidation combined with repayment of savings of failed cooperatives, possibly the transfer of assets and liabilities of failed cooperatives to healthy cooperatives or their continuation after restructuring.” Near-term steps involve tightening and enforcing existing regulatory requirements. The recent crisis reveals flaws in applying the legislative and regulatory framework. The bar for cooperatives must be raised while customising the requirements to the size and nature of the businesses and a realistic supervision capacity. Authorities could tighten existing regulatory requirements in capitalisation, liquidity, loan concentration, and governance. Cooperatives should be required to report regularly. They could be given a certain period to meet the requirements, and compliance with these needs to be closely monitored. The medium-term step involves starting to license cooperatives. As a proper authorisation and licensing process hasn’t been established under the current regime, licensing is needed for both existing cooperatives and new entities.The licensing regime should include a mechanism for the regulator to verify compliance and a process for treating cases of significant non-compliance (which could result in the withdrawal or suspension of the licence). The IMF has recommended ensuring that the Cooperatives Act includes creating a debt information centre, credit tribunal, and savings and guarantee fund for cooperatives. These institutions could be aligned with existing structures, the global organisation said. For example, the debt information centre could be set up within the Credit Information Bureau, allowing all financial institutions access to information on debtors. The savings and guarantee fund could be modelled on the Nepali Deposit Insurance System, which the country started in 2010. Under this scheme, deposit guarantee coverage is up to Rs500,000 per individual per member institution, applicable to savings and fixed deposits. \nIn a bid to lessen the high prevalence of anaemia among adolescent girls, the Ministry of Health and Population has decided to administer iron-folic acid to all girls aged between 10 and 19 from the ongoing fiscal year.The supplementation programme will be implemented in private schools from the new fiscal year, and female community health volunteers will administer the supplement tablets to girls, who do not go to schools, officials said.“All 27,90,562 girls aged between 10 and 19 years will be administered iron-folic acid,” said Lila Bikram Thapa, chief of the Nutrition Section at the Family Welfare Division under the Department of Health Services. “The supplement tablets have been supplied by agencies under the federal government. Provincial and local government agencies have been requested to coordinate with private schools and other stakeholders to implement the programme.”Anaemia is a condition in which blood produces low levels of haemoglobin or healthy red blood cells. Iron and other nutritional deficiencies, malaria, hookworm infection, chronic infections, and genetic conditions, including sickle cell diseases, are among the causes for anaemia. Studies show that 39 percent of girls aged 10 and 19 years and 21 percent of boys of the same age group suffer from anaemia in Nepal. Health authorities however, have been preparing the supplement administration programme only for girls.Health officials said that they have also been considering providing the supplement tablets to boys as well, as several countries have already started administering iron-folic acid to boys.Doctors say anaemia in adults can cause fatigue, lethargy, reduced physical productivity, and poor work performance. It is a major concern among pregnant women, as problems can lead to increased maternal mortality rates and poor birth outcomes.The Health Ministry has been providing the supplement at government schools across the country since 2016. Some local levels had already been administering the supplement tablets in private schools.Thapa said that all schools, whether government or private, will implement the supplementation programme from the new fiscal year. Under the programme, eligible girls will be administered a supplement tablet every week for three months. They will be administered the tablet again after three months and continued for 13 weeks. Thapa said that 26 supplement tablets will be administered per person in a year.The Nepal Demographic and Health Survey-2022 conducted by the ministry shows that 43 percent of the children aged between six to 59 months have been found to be anaemic—25 percent mildly anaemic, 18 percent moderately anaemic and one percent severely anaemic.The prevalence of anaemia in children aged between six to 59 months has decreased from 53 percent in 2016 to 43 percent in 2022. However, the trend has not been consistently downward. In 2006, around 48 percent of children were found to be anaemic. Prevalence of anaemia in the above-mentioned age group was found to be high—50.6 percent in the Madhesh Province, followed by 48.9 percent in Lumbini, 45.4 percent in Sudurpaschim, 42.5 percent in Bagmati, 39.8 percent in Karnali, 33.9 percent in Koshi and 30.7 percent in Gandaki Province.Women living in the Tarai region are more likely to be anaemic (45 percent) than those living in the hills (20 percent) and in the mountainous regions (23 percent), the survey showed. More than half the women (52 percent) are anaemic in the Madhesh Province.In the 1990s, 75 percent of pregnant women in Nepal were found to be suffering from anaemia.Anaemia during pregnancy increases the risk of foetal growth retardation and low birth weight, premature delivery, increased perinatal mortality, and reduced resistance to infection for both mother and baby. Thapa said anaemia is a serious concern for children as it can impair their cognitive development and can have long-term health and economic implications for society. He said that health agencies have been asked to conduct classes in schools to make students aware of hygienic behaviour, nutritious food, and the negative effects of junk food on health.Meanwhile, the Department of Drug Administration has recalled Folicare Tablet (folic acid tablet) batch TES-032 manufactured by Nepali pharmaceutical company Curex Pharmaceuticals Pvt Ltd due to quality issues. \nIn a bid to reduce patient deaths in hospital emergencies, the Ministry of Health and Population has started providing basic life support training to health workers.Officials hope that ongoing deaths in hospital emergencies would come down significantly once health workers were trained in basic life support.“Around 900 health workers, including medical doctors, nurses, paramedics, and health assistants, have already been trained with basic life support skills,” said Dr Prakash Budhathoky, spokesman for the ministry. “The remaining health workers will receive training in the new fiscal year.”Basic life support is a type of care that first responders, who could be health workers serving in hospital emergencies, provide to anyone suffering from cardiac arrest, respiratory distress and other life-threatening conditions.Experts say basic life support is very crucial in emergency situations—cardiac arrest, and trauma cases, among others. The procedure includes recognising and responding to emergency situations, seeking help, performing cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and providing breathing assistance.Chances of survival will be high if trained health workers respond to the cases first. Officials said that the number of patient deaths in emergencies could be reduced significantly if all health workers serving in hospital emergencies were trained with basic life support skills.“We will also encourage provincial governments to provide basic life support skills to health workers serving in provincial hospitals and health centres run by local units,” said Budhathoky. “Those serving in emergencies at private health facilities will also get this training.”Doctors say that basic life support skills can be effective in saving lives when provided promptly and correctly. Health officials say many health workers serving in emergencies of health facilities, especially those hired newly, do not have basic life support skills.Meanwhile, the Nepal Medical Council, the national regulatory body for medical doctors, said it is working to make continuous professional development training mandatory for licence renewal.“Doctors must pass a 100-mark test on ethics, basic life support, communication, infection control and the rational use of medicines,” said Dr Bishwa Raj Dawadi, the council member. “Gone are the days when one would remain a doctor simply by obtaining a medical degree. They must be updated with skills and new knowledge.”A few years ago, the Council made professional development training mandatory for all medical doctors. Failure to attend the course will result in non-renewal of the medical licence.Medical doctors undergo the training regularly, and the council assesses its effectiveness every five years to ensure that doctors providing health care services are updated in their profession.Professional training involves processes that act as refresher courses to update and enhance a doctor’s knowledge, skills, and experience, even after the completion of their formal degree. It can take the form of fellowships, seminars, workshops, conferences, and continuous medical education.The NMC said that CPD (continuous professional development training) is a lifelong process of learning and updating professional skills.Doctors also need to take effective communication skills training so that they can communicate with the families and relatives of patients about their condition and the treatment process, including surgeries. In recent years, there have been reports of scuffles between hospitals/doctors and the kin of patients in the event of a patient’s death. At times, situations have taken a nasty turn in which doctors have been manhandled and hospitals vandalised.The medical council said that implementation of the code of ethics has been a challenge thus far and that training such as the CPD could help in its effective enforcement. One of the problems the NMC is facing currently is its inability to prevent doctors and health institutions from advertising their skills and profession using mass media, which, according to the NMC, is against the code of ethics. \nIn a bid to support midwives and other healthcare personnel in ensuring safer births in low-resource settings, the Ministry of Health and Population has launched a “safe delivery app”.Officials hope that the mobile application will complement and enhance the ongoing capacity-building of health workers and help in reducing maternal and newborn deaths.“The Safe Delivery App provides up-to-date lifesaving procedures and practical guidance in the local language,” said Dr Bibek Kumar Lal, director of the Family Welfare Division under the Department of Health Services, at the launch of the Nepali version of the Safe Delivery App. “It aims to improve the quality of emergency obstetric and newborn care, and the main users will be our frontline health workers, especially nurses and midwives.”Officials at the division said that the government has collaborated with the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) and the Maternity Foundation (MF) to launch the Nepali version of the widely used digital health tool.Globally, every two minutes, a woman dies. In Nepal, two women die every day due to pregnancy-related complications—most of which are preventable, said Won Young Hong, a UNFPA representative in Nepal. “These are staggering numbers. UNFPA is pleased to work with the concerned stakeholders to localise this digital application so healthcare workers across Nepal can use it.”The Safe Delivery App is an evidence-based learning and training tool designed to support midwives, nurses, and other healthcare professionals to assist during births and to manage the most common complications. Among other features, it contains the latest clinical guidelines, animated instruction videos, descriptions of practical procedures, and action cards. It is free, and once downloaded on a smartphone or a tablet, it works offline, making it possible to be used even in the most remote areas. To date, more than 435,000 healthcare professionals across more than 70 countries have been reached through the Safe Delivery App and the accompanying programme worldwide, with Nepal being the latest country to introduce the App. “We will work with provincial governments and development partners to quickly roll out the App throughout Nepal,” said Lal.Nepal cut the maternal mortality rate from 539 per 100,000 births in 1996 to 239 per 100,000 births in 2016—for which the country even received a Millennium Award. According to the National Statistics Office report, the country has further reduced the number of deaths to 151 per 100,000 births in 2021. Maternal health experts, however, say that even if the country has made good progress in reducing maternal deaths, the current maternal mortality ratio is more than double the Sustainable Development Goals target, which is 70 maternal deaths per 100,000 live births by 2030.Neonatal deaths have not declined between 2016 and 2022, according to the Nepal Demographic and Health Survey-2022 carried out by the Ministry of Health and Population.The government’s target for the Sustainable Development Goals was to reduce neonatal mortality to 16 deaths per 1,000 live births by 2022 and 12 in every 1,000 live births by 2030.The SDGs, a follow-up on the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), aim to end poverty, hunger, and all forms of inequality worldwide by 2030, and Nepal has committed to meeting the goals.The health ministry has been taking several measures to reduce maternal and neonatal deaths, including installing an underfloor heating system at birthing centres, setting up special newborn care units, training doctors, nurses, and paramedics in the district hospitals and distributing non-pneumatic anti-shock garments to prevent maternal deaths from excessive bleeding.Besides, the ministry provides free service and travel allowances for those opting for institutional delivery and antenatal visits. It also distributes misoprostol, a medication used to treat postpartum bleeding in new mothers, through female community health volunteers. \nAs heavy monsoon rains cause chaos across the country, dengue cases are surging in several districts, including Kathmandu.According to the Health Office Kathmandu, around 18 people are infected with the dengue virus every day. Officials, however, admit that this number could be just the tip of the iceberg, as the office gets reports only from 18 health facilities.“Yes, the number of people infected with the dengue virus could be several times higher than suggested by the reports we are getting every day,” said Dr Arjun Sapkota, chief of the Health Office, Kathmandu. “We are working to make daily reporting of dengue cases mandatory for private health facilities as well.”Dengue is a viral disease transmitted by female Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes. The same vectors also transmit chikungunya, yellow fever, and Zika virus, according to the World Health Organisation.According to data provided by the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division, at least 1,432 people from 73 districts have been infected with the virus since January this year. Among the 73 districts that reported dengue outbreaks, Kathmandu has the highest number of cases with 159, followed by Jhapa with 120, Chitwan 83, Makawanpur 65, Tanahun and Doti 49 cases each, and Okhaldhunga and Sindhupalchowk 46 each.Sapkota informed that his office has sensitised the local bodies about the looming risk of a massive dengue outbreak in the coming days.“Mandatory reporting of dengue cases every day is among the preventive measures through which we can identify dengue hotspots,” said Sapkota. “This will help health workers target such measures in particular areas. Additionally, starting this week, we are resuming the “10 minutes at 10 am” initiative every Friday, during which mosquito breeding grounds will be destroyed.”Officials informed that several local units, including the Kathmandu Metropolitan City, have already started preventive measures against dengue. Dengue symptoms include mild to high fever, severe muscle pain, rashes, severe headache, and pain in the eyes. Patients with these symptoms are advised to seek immediate treatment. While there is no specific cure for the disease, early detection and proper medical care can prevent death.Doctors say many people infected with dengue show mild symptoms and can be treated with paracetamol at home.Nepal reported its first dengue case in a foreigner in 2004 in the Chitwan district. Since then, an increasing number of dengue infections, including major outbreaks, have been reported from many districts. Last year, at least 20 persons died, and more than 52,000 were infected by the virus, which had spread to all 77 districts.In 2022, a total of 88 people died, and over 54,000 were infected by the virus across the country. During that period, hospitals in the Kathmandu Valley were overwhelmed with dengue patients, and pharmacies ran out of paracetamol, the most widely used medicine to treat fever.In 2019, the disease killed at least six people and more than 16,000 were hospitalised across the country. The virus had spread to 68 districts at the time.Though the post-monsoon period is considered the dengue epidemic season, the deadly disease has already become endemic in Nepal, as outbreaks are reported every month, including in the winter months.According to health workers, storage places for scrap materials, discarded cups, plastic material tossed in open spaces, and unused lands will be potential hotspots for the dengue virus in the coming days. Health workers have warned the owners of these sites that action will be taken if mosquito larvae are found there.Dengue-transmitting mosquitoes breed in clean water and bite people in daylight. Uncovered water tanks and discarded objects, such as plastic cups and bottles, could be breeding grounds for these mosquitoes. \nWith monsoon havoc sweeping across the country, the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division has urged health workers to avoid taking leave during the season.Officials have warned that health facilities could be overwhelmed by patients in the coming days as outbreaks of waterborne and vector-borne diseases are expected, as floodwaters have contaminated most of the drinking water sources.“We have requested the provincial and local health authorities not to grant leave to health workers during the monsoon season,” said Dr Yadu Chandra Ghimire, director of the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division. “Health agencies have been cautioned about the looming risk of outbreaks of waterborne and vector-borne diseases in the coming days.”Torrential rainfall started Friday wreaking havoc in various places across the country. At least 14 people have died in disaster-related incidents—nine in landslides and five in floods—since Friday, according to the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Authority. Officials said 18 others have been injured, and four people are missing. Since the monsoon entered the country on June 10, at least 43 people have died in landslides and flood-related incidents. Lightning strikes killed as many as 19 people during this period.The monsoon season in Nepal is a time of epidemics during which thousands of people across the country become infected with water-borne and vector-borne diseases.The persistent rainfall that started on Friday not only destroyed houses and inundated settlements but also contaminated drinking water sources.Health officials warned that health facilities could witness an uptick in the number of viral fever cases, and waterborne diseases—diarrhoea, dysentery, food poisoning, and snake bites—in the coming days.“We have also requested central hospitals and medical colleges to be prepared for help during disease outbreaks,” said Ghimire. “As we don’t have enough doctors and health workers to deploy to control the outbreaks, we have to seek help from big hospitals and medical colleges.”Officials at the Ministry of Health and Population said that they have been raising awareness through all available means to inform people of the risks. “Essential medicines have been stockpiled, health workers have been asked to be ready for deployment to affected areas, anti-snake venom has been supplied to health facilities,” said Dr Prakash Budhathoki, spokesperson at the Health Ministry. “As of Sunday evening, no outbreaks have been reported.”According to health experts, sources of drinking water generally become contaminated in disaster-hit areas, and people displaced by natural disasters become highly vulnerable to infections with waterborne and vector-borne diseases. Every year, thousands of people get infected with vector-borne diseases such as dengue, kala-azar, malaria, and scrub typhus during this period. Last year, at least 20 persons died, and more than 52,000 were infected by the virus, which had spread to all 77 districts. According to data provided by the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division, at least 1,432 people from 73 districts have been infected with the dengue virus since January this year. Among the 73 districts that reported dengue outbreaks, Kathmandu has the highest number of cases: 159. Public health experts say reported cases could be just the tip of the iceberg, as around 80 percent of those infected are asymptomatic. Likewise, snakebite incidents and resulting deaths are also common during the season, but the phenomenon, which experts dub “a lurking invisible crisis”, remains grossly neglected. “Incidents of snakebites have started to surge over the last few weeks,” said Dr Rajiv Jha, director at Provincial Health Directorate of Madhesh Province. “Along with the surge in waterborne and vector-borne diseases in the coming days, we have anticipated a rise in snakebite cases.”Doctors say the only ways to prevent deaths from waterborne diseases, including diarrhoea, are to raise awareness and ensure safe drinking water.They say a combination of careful surveys, ensuring safe drinking water, maintaining sanitation and hygiene, social mobilisation and treatment are required to contain the spread of the diarrhoeal infection. \nI can vividly remember my first encounter with baking when I was 10 years old. We had just moved to our new home and got a cable connection. The cable opened a world of possibilities, as it gave me access to various contents.This was back in the late 2000s when YouTube would take hours to load, taunting us with its buffering screen. I was particularly drawn to travel and lifestyle channels, mainly TLC, Fox Life, and Food Network, which kept me informed about different foods and cultures. I don’t know why, but I was always drawn to desserts. It was fascinating to see how these miraculous treats made people smile at the end of the meal.Growing up in Nepal, I noticed that baking wasn't very common. While some families did have ovens, they were mostly multifunctional ones used primarily for heating food.I also noticed that most of our desserts didn't require an oven, as they could be made on a stovetop. So, you can imagine my excitement when my mom decided to buy an oven during one of her festive shopping sprees.I could finally feel the joy these channels portrayed. (I blame food writer Nigella Lawson for getting me hooked on a domestic lifestyle.) Then, one day, after watching one of the cooking episodes on television, I finally mustered enough strength and decided to bake something. I distinctly remember wanting to make a chocolate cake for myself after watching one of Rachel Allen’s bake series. I watched all the ingredients used in that recipe and scurried across my pantry, only to realise I didn’t have half of the stuff she mentioned. I then decided to improvise the recipe (a big mistake). I randomly combined the ingredients that I had in a mixing bowl and chucked the batter into my oven, hoping for a magical cake to pop out an hour later.After I saw the result an hour later, I was mortified. The cake was stuck in the pan, refusing to come out, and it was as dense as fudge. I convinced myself that the taste was what mattered most, but when I served a slice to my brother, he made a face of utter disgust.That was the day I realised that baking soda was not the same as baking powder.After this incident, I researched baking and found out it was technical. This was a blessing in disguise for me, as I loved science, and I started to view baking as a science experiment. I then reflected and evaluated how to perfect one's baking skills.I analysed my errors and noted down all the steps I did every time I baked. Home baking is a passion for many. The idea of turning a few simple ingredients into a delicious masterpiece is as enchanting as it sounds.Yet, for many of us, this seemingly magical process can often turn into a series of unfortunate events, leading to crumbled dreams and deflated ambitions. Dense cakes, burnt crusts, rock-hard cookies and unrisen bread, if you are an amateur baker, then you have seen it all. But why do these mishaps happen so often? And most importantly how do we overcome them?From my experience, behind every successful bake lies a series of challenges and mishaps that test even the most dedicated bakers. Baking has its own set of rules that you need to follow to get that scrumptious treat every time. So, to transform a recipe into an actual dish that will impress your friends and family, I am sharing with you some of the tips and tricks I learned from my tumultuous journey as a home baker.First things first, we have to look into the prime appliance that we are working with. Commercial ovens are of two types: one that runs on gas and the other that runs on electricity. We have to look at the oven present at our home and consider its pros and cons. The main benefits of a gas oven are its size and temperature control. One can quickly change the temperature just by twisting the knob, and it preheats much more quickly than an electric one. However, they are known to have uneven temperatures at times and release more humidity, making it harder to properly crisp or brown food. This can result in burnt edges and cold or hot spots. An electric oven, on the other hand, provides more even and consistent temperatures and doesn’t release as much moisture in the air.This dry oven environment makes it easier to brown your items, making it great for baking bread. However, while the dry oven results in more even cooking, you also run the risk of drying out cakes and other baked goods.Also, many people forget to preheat the oven before baking, which is crucial for maintaining an even temperature throughout the baking process. When baking cakes and bread, I like to place a small tray of water at the bottom of the oven to provide moisture and prevent the baked goods from drying out.An oven thermometer can be a baker's best friend, providing a true reading and ensuring your creations bake evenly. I also like rotating the pan midway while baking, as it allows for an even distribution of heat.The next thing people mess up on is measuring and the specificity of ingredients in a recipe. Our moms made our food with their instinct; it is something that they learned along the way, but when you are baking, you cannot instinctively add or omit a few steps.I think that is why we initially had problems with baking. In a culture where cooking comes instinctually, baking challenges us, to be precise. A gram of more or less of any ingredient can drastically alter the outcome. Different methods of measuring flour can yield different results.Every component in baking serves a distinct purpose and function. Flour offers structure, sugar adds sweetness and moisture, eggs bind things together, and butter enhances taste and texture. However, not all ingredients are created equally. For example, using salted butter instead of unsalted might change the taste profile of your meal.Similarly, different flours have varying protein concentrations, which affect the texture of baked goods. The type of sugar used also makes a difference. Granulated sugar, brown sugar, powdered sugar, and speciality sugars like turbinado or muscovado each add unique flavours to a bake.Understanding these nuances and how they interact is critical for getting the intended outcomes. Accurate measurement tools and techniques are essential, but mastering them can be a steep learning curve. So, I would recommend investing in a kitchen scale that allows for more accurate measurements by weight rather than volume.Moving on, leavening agents such as baking soda, baking powder, and yeast are required to make baked goods rise. However, they can also cause confusion and errors. Baking soda needs an acidic component to activate, but baking powder has both an acid and a base, making it self-activating.Using the wrong type of flour or sugar, or using them in incorrect proportions, can result in flat, overly raised, or collapsed cakes. Yeast, being a living organism, presents its challenges.The water temperature must be just right—not too hot to kill the yeast, nor too cold to inhibit its activity. Proofing times and conditions also need to be carefully managed to achieve the perfect rise.Bakers should also be careful about the way they mix ingredients. The method of mixing ingredients can significantly impact the final product. Over-mixing can develop too much gluten in cakes and pastries, leading to tough textures.Under-mixing can leave pockets of unincorporated ingredients, resulting in uneven bakes. Techniques like folding, creaming, and whipping each serve specific purposes and must be executed with care.Finally, home bakers must understand the importance of timing and patience in baking. Even a minute or two can make the difference between perfectly baked cookies and burnt edges.Recipes often provide a range for baking times, but factors like oven hot spots, pan material, and altitude can affect these times. It’s crucial to keep a close eye on your bakes and rely on visual and tactile cues, such as a cake pulling away from the sides of the pan or a toothpick coming out clean, to determine doneness.Baking is also an exercise in patience, a virtue not everyone possesses. Doughs need time to rest and rise, flavours need time to meld, and baked goods need time to cool before they can be enjoyed.Impatience can lead to underbaked centres, crumbling slices, and a general sense of frustration. Cultivating patience is as important as mastering any technique in the baker’s repertoire.Home baking is a journey full of ups and downs, but it comes with great rewards. The obstacles encountered teach valuable lessons in patience, precision, and perseverance.The satisfaction of success, the freedom to create, and the therapeutic benefits make the endeavour meaningful. Whether baking for oneself, loved ones, or as an artistic outlet, the journey is as fulfilling as the result. Embrace the flour-dusted countertops, occasional setbacks, and the joys of home bakingFor a beginner-friendly recipe that involves mixing ingredients and delivers amazing results, try my recipe for fudgy, nutty brownies that I call ‘Bliss Brownies’.Bliss Brownies150g unsalted butter plus extra for the tin150g chopped dark chocolate200g caster sugar½ tsp baking powder2 eggs80g cocoa powder150g plain flour70g mixture of nuts (walnuts and almonds)60g blended papayaMix all the ingredients (except the dark chocolate and nuts) in a blender or a food processor and blitz till you get a smooth paste.Fold the chocolate and the nuts into the brownie batter, making sure that the pieces are evenly mixed in.Grease a loaf pan with soft butter and dust with cocoa powder. Pour the batter into the loaf pan.Bake in a preheated oven at 170c for 40 minutes and let it cool in the oven for an hour. Enjoy with a cup of coffee or, as I like it, a scoop of vanilla ice cream. \nIn a world where acceptance and safety often seem difficult to attain, many queer individuals also struggle to find a safe space to express themselves. They have to hide their true self and face relentless judgement when going to public places like cafes and restaurants.This is the reality for countless LGBTQIA+ individuals. The need for a safe space for this community is not just a desire but a necessity—a space where one can be themselves. This struggle for safety and acceptance can be traced to crucial historical moments, such as the Stonewall Riots of 1969 in New York City.The Stonewall Inn was more than a bar; it was a refuge for the queer community. When police raided the bar, the community fought back. This series of violent confrontations, which began in the early hours of June 28, 1969, between police and gay rights activists, marked the beginning of the modern LGBTQIA+ rights movement. The spirit of Stonewall, the fight for dignity and the right to exist openly lives on in places like Inclusive Galaxy Restaurant in Kathmandu. Inclusive Galaxy beyond a restaurant is an ‘oasis’ for the queer community and beyond.Founded by Bishwaraj Adhikari, Mr Gay Handsome Nepal 2013, a human rights defender, the restaurant proves the power of safe spaces. It’s a place where the community can unite, free from the prejudice and hostility that often permeate their everyday lives.After years of working in the human rights sector, Adhikari and his partner developed the idea for Inclusive Galaxy. What began as a small cafe gradually evolved into a full-fledged restaurant, driven by the growing demand and support from the community.“In developed countries with strong LGBTQIA+ movements, you can find community areas like gay villages. These are created as safe spaces for people whose families and communities have excluded them. They also support new business ideas and pink tourism. I hope to see pink tourism develop in Nepal someday,” says Adhikari. His vision for Inclusive Galaxy goes beyond just being a restaurant. He aims to promote financial independence and empowerment within the queer community.Since its inception in February 2019, Inclusive Galaxy has become a key spot for many in Lazimpat, a relatively queer-friendly area in Kathmandu. The location is essential because the first LGBTQIA+ movement in Nepal started in 2001 through the Blue Diamond Society.Inclusive Galaxy, true to its name, welcomes everyone—queer and non-queer alike—to share a comfortable space. His vision was clear: to create a space where people of all genders and sexual identities could come together without fear of exclusion.“I didn’t want to make it exclusively for queer people because that would be excluding ourselves from society. Different groups need to live together and understand each other,” Adhikari explains.In the early days, the cafe attracted both queer and non-queer customers. However, when some of the residents learned about Adhikari’s identity and the nature of the clientele, there was a brief period of hesitation. “At first, I didn’t understand what was happening, but then I realised my identity was an issue for a few people. I believe people should be judged by others by their character, not by their gender or sexuality. Over time, as residents saw that we operated like any other cafe, they became more comfortable,” Adhikari reflects.Adhikari started Inclusive Galaxy to give queer individuals a place to be proud of themselves, counteracting the self-doubt and insecurity that hiding one’s identity can cause. This turned the cafe very quickly into a community hub. The journey was not without challenges, though. It was difficult to hire staff and cooks from the LGBTQIA+ community, and soon after the restaurant opened, the COVID pandemic made things even harder.Despite these difficulties, the doors of Inclusive Galaxy remained open. During the pandemic, many queer individuals, who were abandoned by their families or afraid to return home, found comfort at Inclusive Galaxy.Since many couldn’t afford to pay for meals, the restaurant provided free food from its resources. As the number of people needing meals grew to 20-30 daily, Adhikari started raising funds within the community.“During my time as an activist, many people came here not only for food but also to see an organisation where the queer community supports one another,” Adhikari says.“The time during COVID was difficult, but it brought me closer to the community.”Four years after its inception, the restaurant has garnered a loyal following. Sarosy Neupane, Miss Pink Nepal 2024 first runner-up, describes Inclusive Galaxy as her second home. She moved to Kathmandu to study in 2022. Being distant from her family, she started visiting Galaxy for meals that reminded her of home-cooked food. Over time, she grew attached to the café because of its welcoming atmosphere.“It’s heartwarming to see people from our community and different walks of life here. The founders even invite us to festivals like ‘Dahi Chiura Khane din,’” she shares.Neupane visits the cafe regularly and sometimes stays until 3 am, engrossed in conversations. “I hope more spaces like this can open in the future. If, unfortunately, this place were to close someday, I don’t think we’d have any other place to turn to,” she adds.Muna Chhetri, a trans woman who has been a loyal customer for three years, shares, “This is my safe space where I can truly be myself. I always feel judged in other restaurants, but that fear doesn’t exist here. It’s where even those who aren’t accepted at home can feel accepted.”Sahara Khadka Chhetri, owner of Pink Tiffany, Kathmandu’s first openly LGBTIQIA+ friendly restaurant and bar, frequently visits after managing the bar, appreciating the convenience of not cooking at home.She notes very few places like this cater to our community, and some even had to close during COVID. “As an entrepreneur, I know that sustaining these spaces is a challenge. But as more spaces like these open, they will make the way for a more inclusive and compassionate society.”The welcoming atmosphere at Inclusive Galaxy has also had a surprising effect on non-queer patrons. Samriddha Jung Rana, a twenty-year-old neighbour who identifies as straight, often visits the café and appreciates the importance of such spaces.“Previously, I didn’t know much about the queer community and didn’t care much. But now, coming into this café, I’ve been interested in their rights and issues. I’ve realised that we’re not so different after all. We are all human,” he remarks.The ventures like Inclusive Galaxy and Pink Tiffany have inspired hope for collaborative businesses between queer and non-queer groups. The recent initiative by the Nepal Tourism Board promoting Pink Tourism in April 2024 is a positive step. Still, Adhikari believes that more support is needed from the government and the private sector.Despite the progress, challenges remain. However, Adhikari remains optimistic about the future. He is working on plans to develop the restaurant into a homestay program in the future.“Like how different planets, asteroids, and stars make up a beautiful galaxy, people from all walks of life and identities make a beautiful society. I am happy that we are assimilating together in this space. We are not so different; we are all different and similar simultaneously,” he says. \nAditya Mishra is a Nepali chef and entrepreneur based in New York. Passionate about elevating Nepali cuisine globally, Mishra sharpened his culinary skills while staging at various Michelin-starred restaurants in the city during his time at culinary school. A recipient of the James Beard Foundation National Scholars Scholarship in 2023, Mishra’s early experiences inspired him to establish his own supper club, ‘The Sewing Tin’, alongside co-founder Akhil Upad.In an interview with Post’s Aarati Ray, Mishra discusses his restaurant in New York, serving Nepali cuisines there and the recipe for his signature dish.How did your cooking journey start in New York?At 14, I told my parents I wanted to be a chef, but they preferred I pursue a stable career like engineering, as many Nepali families do. So, I left for Louisiana in 2019 to study engineering.But, cooking never left my heart so, after a year, I left engineering college and moved to New York City. It’s been three and a half years and my parents only learned about it later. When my mom visited me in NYC and saw my dedication to cooking, she saw my passion and supported my decision.What sparked your interest in cooking from a young age?As a child, I was drawn to cooking shows on TLC. The glamour of cooking, eating, travelling and the prosperity of famous chefs was fascinating.Around age 16, I discovered Chef Anthony Bourdain’s groundbreaking book, ‘Kitchen Confidential’, which shed light on the reality of the culinary industry. I learned how he became a cultural icon in NYC, reshaping perceptions of chefs.I was also fascinated by chefs like Marco Pierre White, who was a mentor to Gordon Ramsay. Their stories of achieving fame while maintaining discipline intrigued me. But, as I grew older and entered the culinary world, I realised it was far from glamorous—it involved dedication and I am glad I persevered.How did the idea for The Sewing Tin originate?The concept of ‘The Sewing Tin’ came when I realised the stark contrast between the romanticised view of kitchen work and its harsh reality. Witnessing the struggles of many kitchen staff—economic hardships, immigration challenges and language barriers—I had to rediscover my love for cooking.During my internship at ‘Junoon’ restaurant, I met my co-founder, Akhil Upad, who shared my culinary enthusiasm despite his preparations for medical college. Together, we wanted to create a dining experience that was more personal and communal, offering fine dining with a sense of community.We wanted our food to tell stories, so we named our restaurant ‘The Sewing Tin’ inspired by the immigrant experience in NYC. When immigrants opened cookie boxes as kids, they often found sewing supplies instead of food.‘The Sewing Tin’ is like opening a cookie box and finding sewing supplies—something uniquely desi, or South Asian. How do you promote Nepali cuisine in New York City through The Sewing Tin?My partner is from Atlanta with Indian roots, while I come from Nepal, so our menu celebrates and reflects both cultures and heritage.We represent our respective cultures authentically. For example, we have a dish inspired by Newari cuisine called kachaila, similar to French Tartar. We present it as Tartar to make it accessible to our customers but infuse it with Nepali flavours, telling stories about its origins and giving diners a taste of my homeland.What do you think of the prospects of Nepali cuisine abroad?I’m on a mission to share Nepali food worldwide. I have served up dishes like chatamari and lamb sekuwa in my restaurant. But I’m still learning and want to explore more of Nepal’s cuisines. My big dream? To make Nepali cuisine reach more places because it’s got something special that can wow taste buds everywhere.How do you see the changes in restaurants in Nepal?The restaurant industry has deep roots in community and bringing people together, dating back centuries. While this core idea remains, modern restaurants have evolved, making changes to adapt to the times.Yet, in Nepal, despite the growing number of restaurants, many lack uniqueness and storytelling, focusing more on making money than fostering a sense of community.I’ve noticed a troubling trend of rising prices, especially for beloved dishes like momos, which makes people question if they're getting value for their money. It seems like profits are taking precedence over creating genuine, authentic culinary experiences.The industry is starting to lose the creativity and passion that once made it special. It might be time for chefs to shake things up, challenge the norm and bring fresh ideas to the table, revitalising the culinary scene with renewed energy and creativity.What challenges have you faced in New York as an outsider?Living in a bustling city like New York as an outsider has its challenges. But, this city is also full of opportunities for those who are passionate. If you stay true to your culture and want to share your story, opportunities are waiting for you.Even though it can be daunting because of the tough competition, the city appreciates determination and expertise. When I started my journey here, all I wanted to do was cook, eat and share the story of Nepal and its diverse cultures. Instead of focusing on the difficulties, I embraced the chance to follow my passion.What do you think about the criticism of blending Nepali food with modern culinary styles?Chefs care about their food—it’s like they’re sharing a story. They’ve put in a lot of effort to become skilled, so let them be creative. It’s okay to give helpful advice but don’t be mean just to criticise. Chefs shouldn’t also just copy what’s popular, they should cook what they truly love. That’s what makes food special and meaningful.Mishra’s signature dish:Confit Duck Chatamari A traditional Nepali delicacy with French influence.Ingredients:Duck (Legs and breast)Rice (soaked overnight)MayonnaiseWhole spices (cloves, cinnamon, cardamom, bay leaf)Red onionGarlicGingerMula ko achar (Fermented radish)ScallionsLemon juiceNepali pepperVinegarSaltSugarProcedure:For the Duck:Season duck with salt and pepper.Cook in a covered pan with whole spices, garlic, and ginger at low heat for 2 hours on a stove (270 degrees in the oven)Increase heat to crisp up the skin (approximately 15 minutes).Shred the duck meat.Confit Garlic Aioli:Mash cooked garlic and ginger and mix with mayonnaise, lemon juice, Nepali pepper and fermented radishes.Pickled Onions:Slice onions and cook in a mixture of vinegar, water, salt, sugar, and whole spices until softened (about 10 minutes).For the chatamari:Blend soaked rice to make a batter, let it ferment for 6 hours, and adjust consistency with water.Assembling:Cook chatamari batter in duck fat for 4 minutes.Top with shredded duck, aioli, pickled onions and scallions.Serve \nCeleus Baral exudes a serene aura when you meet her, and when she tells you she bakes, it makes sense. Even during a brief encounter, you can tell she has the patience needed to be a baker.“You can eyeball cooking, but baking is chemistry. You have to be meticulous. You cannot rush it, or it does not turn out as expected,” says the 21-year-old environment science student. She also runs the online baking shop Bakeleus. Recently, she has also started selling her baked goods beyond her online shop, with her first stall appearing at The Yellow House’s Night Market. Bakeleus’s menu lists a variety of offerings, including jams, granola, tarts, cakes, cookies, cupcakes and brownies. Baral began baking in 2020, during the lockdown, and launched her online shop last year.She grows much of the produce she incorporates into her baking, and believes we should all understand the origins of our food. “This connection fosters gratitude and a deeper appreciation for nature,” she says. Her background in environmental science, coupled with her affinity for the natural world, imbues her creations with a unique artistic sensibility. Each item she bakes is a testament to her creativity and experimentation, as she believes consistent practice is the key to mastery.Despite the demands of being a full-time student, Baral strives to accommodate orders, typically requiring a minimum of 72 hours' notice for delivery. She is a passionate and discerning individual, evident in the love she infuses into her baking. Additionally, Baral advocates for a zero-waste policy at home, ensuring that every scrap of food and all household items are recycled.Three easy to bake recipes you can try at homeMini carrot cakes Ingredients:38 g milk or yoghurt35 g all-purpose flour1/4 tea spoon ground cinnamon1/8 tea spoon ground gingerA pinch of cardamom1 tea spoon baking powder½ tea spoon fine sea salt2 large eggs, at room temperature27 g granulated sugar13 g brown sugar (or 39 g of regular granulated sugar)1 tea spoon vanilla extract27 g extra virgin olive oil33 g carrots, peeled and shreddedChopped walnutsCandied lemon or orange slices (optional for garnish)Cream cheese frosting56.5 g unsalted butter, softened113.5 g cream cheese, softened1/2 teaspoon vanilla extractA pinch of salt250 g powdered sugarDirections:For the cake:Preheat the oven to 195°C.

The vegetable is relatively cheap and used in almost all cuisines and curries. This ubiquity could perhaps be why someone might be snubbingly called an ‘aloo’ in Nepal, but the reference does not make potatoes less important.Why have them With zero fat, potatoes contain many important nutrients—vitamins B1, B6, Vitamin C, which is an antioxidant, minerals and fibre. Along with starch, it is a good source of potassium, copper, vitamin C, manganese, phosphorus, niacin, dietary fibre and pantothenic acid. Potassium derived from potatoes is an electrolyte that benefits the heart, muscles and nervous system. Potato skin contains fibre, which is important for digestive health.Compared to other vegetables, potatoes are more energy-dense. It is free of fat, gluten, cholesterol and sodium. The relatively cheap plant-based food is also a good source of carbohydrates. Filled with nutrients, one can get a lot of them by consuming potatoes.Sourcing of potatoesPotatoes thrive in diverse climatic conditions. The country cultivates potatoes on around 200,000 hectares of land—from the plains of Tarai to the mountainous region.Every year, Nepal churns out around 3,410,000 tons of the stuff. It also imports potatoes and potato products worth Rs 8.71 billion.“These imports include potato chips, frozen potatoes and fresh potatoes,” said Biswas Poudel, a senior technical officer at the National Potato Research Programme.As its cultivation is possible in diverse landscapes, even climate change does not affect potato farming, experts say. Types of potatoesRed and white potatoes are popular and widely available in the country. Lately, dark potatoes or blue potatoes are gaining popularity.“Red potatoes are highly popular,” said Poudel. “Potatoes that come in colour contain more nutrients. Darker potatoes are packed with antioxidants.”Potatoes that taste sweet are a good source of vitamin A, an important nutrient for immunity and eye health. Purple potatoes are rich in antioxidants, including anthocyanins that may prevent heart disease and cancer and boost brain health.Other benefits As potatoes contain important nutrients, they benefit human health in multiple ways. Iron, phosphorus, calcium, magnesium, and zinc contained in potatoes help the body build and maintain its structure and strength. Consumption of the vegetable that is rich in potassium, calcium and magnesium helps reduce blood pressure naturally. Potatoes also contain a significant amount of fibre, which helps in lowering cholesterol levels in the blood and ultimately lessens the risk of heart disease. Fibre also boosts digestive health.Compared to other green vegetables, farmers use only a minimal amount of pesticides in potatoes, making them safe to eat. Chips and french friesOf late potato chips and french fries are gaining popularity in Nepal. They are also popular dishes in most restaurants and people have even started making french fries at home. Children love potato chips the most. Intake of nutrients and micronutrients, fibre and antioxidants components depends on how potatoes were cooked or prepared for food.Consumption of a lot of chips and french fries can lead to added calories and unhealthy weight gain.“Fibre and antioxidant and other micronutrients of the potatoes may be lost while frying,” said Poudel. “As potatoes are a carbohydrate-rich vegetable, it is not necessary to consume them with rice, which many people do in Nepal.”Experts say diabetic people should limit their potato intake as they cause spikes in blood sugar. \nThe noise of ever-growing traffic, the breaking and mending of black-topped roads, and an ever-expanding concrete jungle are some features that one would associate with the Kathmandu Valley.It is a wildly growing urban forest quickly transforming into a busy metropolis where every inch of space is ready to be sold and built. Yet, pockets of the past remain—small, peaceful neighbourhoods where houses are still made of wood, paths are made of stone tiles, and the stillness of a world that wants to stay intact and immobile. These places are known for tourism, culture, and the restoration of community pride. One such stop is the quiet village of Khokana in southern Lalitpur.Khokana is comparatively close to the mainland urban Lalitpur; from the ring road junction of Bagdole, it takes only a 10-minute drive to reach there. From the airport, you can take a cab directly to Khokana, which will take around half an hour. Get your cameras and hiking boots ready; the area is filled with historical artefacts and hiking trails.However, it is vastly different from the city. It is much nearer to the hills, where stone-paved paths, which could easily be goat trails, are rare in today’s Kathmandu.One such goat trail leads to Sikali temple, a major attraction of the area and accessible only on foot. The pavements are lined with big and small temples on each side, along with ponds that serve as clean water sources and a location for religious rituals. The houses are made of bricks and wood. The concrete invasion, although present, is minimal. Scattered every few hundred metres are small mustard oil mills, co-operative businesses of the locals of Khokana that have existed since medieval times.A site well-recognised for its historical significance, Khokana was even proposed to be made a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1996. Sikali TempleAround an hour’s walk from the historic town, Sikali Temple can be reached, which is also the location for its famed Sikali Jatra.While it can be reached through any public vehicle, a more holistic and adventurous route is to follow the goat trails on the outskirts of Khokana. This route, albeit long, allows for great hiking opportunities, scenic views of the hills surrounding the Kathmandu Valley, and a close-up view of the mediaeval but well-maintained architecture of the local houses.Even if you lose the way, which is very possible, the locals are very welcoming and more than willing to guide you. The main temple itself is three stories tall, and built in the Pagoda style, a common style in many temples in the valley.It is surrounded by a lush grass field which plays the stage to the Sikali Jatra held every year. The temple, like many religious spots around Khokana, is dedicated to the local deity Shree Rudrayani.The Sikali Jatra, a five-day festival that serves as an alternative to Dashain for the Khokana locals, is filled with chariot dances, battle enactments, and storytelling celebrations in the worship of Goddess Rudrayani.Starting from Ghatasthapana in mid to late September, the Jatra is vibrant and an essential experience for every visitor. Historical Khokana townKhokana’s historical town is located around 5 minutes walking distance from the local bus park. The town complex, paved with hand-made stone tiles, is graced with the Indrayanee temple but also has many red-bricked houses built in the local Newari architecture, some of them centuries old.One such house is the ‘Khokana Museum’. Although closed, it is widely popular for being the first house to be lit with electricity in Nepal, as Chandra Shamsher did in 1911.The stand-holder of the first light bulb can still be seen, serving as a historical monument for everyone to see.Similarly, the town complex is also filled with Guthi houses, small ponds, and even the local Ward office. While the Ward office provides a wealth of information for visitors interested in the area’s history, the Guthi halls symbolise the strong community support culture of the locals.The ponds, a notable one present right opposite the Indrayanee temple, have stone taps and remind us of primitive ways of obtaining clean water—a practice many locals are still engaged in.Yet, these ponds are also religious locations, especially used in rituals in the Sikali Jatra.Finally, a stroll through the complex allows visitors to explore old houses and historical artefacts in the serene quietness of Khokana, while the small outlets and Choila places nearby allow you to enjoy the spicy duck or chicken delicacies at the same time.Overall, the historical complex is enough to transport visitors back to a glimpse of the medieval past of the Kathmandu Valley. Mustard oil millsThe most well-known feature of Khokana is its mustard oil mills, which have been operational for hundreds of years and have been using the same methods of preparation since their inception.These mills, scattered throughout Khokana, are often community-owned, and even the ones owned by certain individuals have almost exclusively employed locals.Despite the advent of modern machinery, there is still substantial demand for their products due to the assured guarantee.When I visited one such mill, the local staff informed me that the furnace and oil presser used by them were 300 years old, given by the Patan royalty even before the Shahs became king.In addition to buying pure, organically created mustard oil and pellets, visiting these oil mills offers many educational benefits for international and local tourists alike.Khokana offers visitors a unique glimpse into a preserved bubble of the past through its tranquillity, preservation of ancient lifestyle and cultural elements, and remarkable self-sustenance.  \n“How much oxygen do you have for the summit?”I think this is the kind of question a film producer would ask. But when you're on the mountain, the answer is never clear.I have worked for a long time in the film industry and different art areas, especially photography and engraving.Working in various fields and drawing inspiration from them has become a new normal for me. I have made this approach my way of life without even realising it.I took responsibility for producing the last movie I worked on and shot the behind-the-scenes footage for a documentary. By doing so, I witnessed the entire shooting process and the journey of a movie.In the snowy highlands of Turkey, we had to endure the consequences of the changing climate to shoot ‘About Dry Grasses’, directed by Nuri Bilge Ceylan. The highlands used to be snowy in January, but by the time we got there in the same month, there was no snow. Nature was changing. It was responding to what was happening—to what humanity had done to it. In the end, it snowed, and we shot the intense snow scenes we wanted. But since most of our days were sunny, unlike what the director wanted, we had to shoot in the sunset and sunrise hours. As crew members, we spent many days waiting for the sun to set.Production requires creating opportunities, finding solutions, and being creative for a work of art to come true. For this, patience, endurance, calmness, and timing are necessary. On the other hand, nature wanted us to listen to it and wait for the right time.During that time, I witnessed many of nature's lessons. For example, I experienced extreme cold for the first time. We endured temperatures ranging from -33 degrees to +55 degrees. By listening to nature, surrendering to its forces, and working within its limits, we managed to persevere.No matter how much you prepare or plan during the pre-production phase, if you are working in nature, remember that nature will always have the final say.The film was completed, released, and connected with audiences. Its success at Cannes 2023 was followed by my trip to the North Pole for my project. I returned with a mix of wonderful developments, joys, and challenges. During this process, I experienced life and death, happiness and sadness, losses and awards.I realised the value of being able to breathe comfortably a few days after my father's chemotherapy ended. Just a few days earlier, he had said, \"Well done, my daughter. I'm glad you went!\" All the anxiety and hard work, filled with fears at the beginning, were finally behind me.Before going to Everest, when I was on the verge of giving up, defeated by my fears, I remembered my father's words. Everest reminded me of what he said while struggling to breathe, adding a turning point to my life.What does it mean to say ‘life’s turning point?’ How many turning points can there be in life?Who am I, and what am I doing in this world? How well do I know my own limits? Can I find answers to these big questions? These thoughts sparked my dream of journeying to Everest. Now, after returning, I can say that it turned my life around.“How much oxygen do you need for the summit?” sounds more like “How much do you need to hold on to life?” How many reasons do you find that give meaning to your life, keep you alive, and allow you to breathe? How much can you endure in the face of obstacles, and can you keep believing that a solution will eventually come your way?Can these questions be separated from the idea of measuring and assessing something, from learning its quantity and financial value? Can everything be known with certainty? Should the journey be fully understood in advance, with all its promises laid out? Should it be viewed like a purchase with a price tag, asking, “Is this journey worth this much?”I had never trekked before and had no climbing experience. I had lived at sea level my entire life and had never been to a high altitude.However, this journey was not only about the physical climb but also an inner discovery. After losing my father to lung cancer, his breathing difficulties taught me the fragility of breath, life, and existence. I also mentally prepared myself for the physical challenges I might face. Despite all my concerns, could this journey help me understand the cycle of life and the resilience of the soul?So, how could I make this trek possible? How could I land in Nepal? Despite all the economic difficulties and the many things I felt needed organising, I did my best and believed in it.Since I was embarking on this journey, I felt I should share about my travels and inspire others.Starting with photography, cinema, and engraving, which are already integral parts of my life, I dreamed of documenting and sharing the inspiring aspects of this journey.After months of correspondence and dreaming, it all came true. Finally, I embarked on the journey with the goal of creating photographs, engravings, and documentaries. I learned a great deal from my travels in Nepal, from the people I met, and from every moments I witnessed. I felt incredibly fortunate to have been able to honour my father’s memory with the peace and serenity I experienced in the Himalayas.During my 15-day journey to Everest Base Camp, I encountered nature’s masterpieces at every turn. As concerns like “How will I endure?” and “How will I finish?” started to weigh on me, the mountains suddenly parted with the clouds and gazed down at me.It was amazing to witness the appearance of ‘Gods’ that I had never seen before, in such immense size and in such a close, awe-inspiring manner beside me during that silent walk.As someone who came from one of the most crowded cities in the world, Istanbul, while I struggled with my daily questions and uncertainties, trying to control everything, they stood there calmly, as if answering me.They were just there—before and after.My guide, Lakhpa Sherpa, always reminded me not to worry about how high we were, how long it would take to reach our accommodation, or what the weather would be like. He encouraged me to live in the moment, and he was right.He advised me to focus on my breathing, not to get thirsty, to eat enough, and to appreciate the extraordinary beauty of the journey. In the mountains, plans dissolve and each moment is embraced as it comes.All the good wishes, prayers, and everything encountered along the way were for the journey itself. The mountain was full of life, secrets, and everything I had wondered about.This 15-day journey to Everest Base Camp was a solo adventure, yet I wouldn't have been able to complete it without my guide, Lhakpa, and my porter. Additionally, I was fortunate enough to experience the hospitality, generosity, and honesty at Trekkers Paradise, which organised the entire journey and provided guidance.I witnessed how dedication and sincerity are crucial in completing a journey safely and healthily. Ghanshyam Sharma, from Trekkers Paradise and Sauraj Jhingan, a climber who summited the Everest in 2018, shared their experiences with me during the journey.They experienced the 2015 earthquake while they were at the Everest Base Camp.As a filmmaker, their role as actors, and attention to detail played a significant role in bringing my dream photography and documentary project to life.The sponsors of my journey were Turkish Airlines, The North Face, Apple, Canon, and Stanley. My supporters include Oscar International College and Nepal Film Campus. Throughout the journey, I shared many experiences, memories, and countless photos and images with my students.On my way back home after 21 days, I celebrated my birthday on the plane. From the right window, the Himalayas bid me farewell. I felt like I had opened a new chapter in my life, and I was certain that I would return.I had made many friends and memories in Nepal.For now, I will be working on a documentary and preparing for a photography and engraving exhibition titled ‘My Soul Beyond the Mountain’.To the Himalayas: This summer was spent with you, but we will meet again soon. \nWe spent five days in Sri Lanka two weeks ago, driving up and down the island, covering almost 70 percent of its territory. Our tour spanned over 1,000 kilometres, including hills, beach spots, and heritage and religious sites.Our first stop in Sri Lanka was Colombo’s Bandaranaike International Airport. We were greeted by a warm and humid breeze when we exited the airport. The host briefed us (a group of journalists) that heavy rainfall has affected areas across Sri Lanka since mid-May 2024. Rain and storms intensified on June 1, with the most significant effects in the south and west of the country. We were lucky to have no rain in the forecast.On the first night, we checked into the lavish Jetwing Lake resort, an opulent sanctuary amidst the lush landscape. The resort’s expansive grounds were a retreat, offering a glimpse of Sri Lanka's natural beauty. We feasted on delicious cuisine, every bite exploding with flavour, introducing us to the island’s famed culinary delights. On June 7, early morning, the sun shone brightly, previewing the promise of an incredible journey ahead. We set off early the following day, eager to explore the mysteries of this enchanting island. As we ventured further into the heart of Sri Lanka, the landscape revealed its majestic nature. We were astounded by seeing Pidurangala Rock, a 200-metre-high granite colossus just a kilometre north of Sigiriya. The short hike to Pidurangala Rock offered breathtaking views of Sigiriya and beyond. We climbed the steep steps and soon were rewarded with a breathtaking panoramic view of the surrounding landscape. It took us 30 minutes to climb. The sight took our breaths away and left us humbled in the presence of such grandeur. From the top are glorious vistas of the surrounding landscape and an incredible view of the majestic Sigiriya Rock. From there, Sigiriya Lion’s Rock is visible, standing alone. This was the place where demon king Ravana had his palace in the Treta Yuga. Believed to have been built 50 centuries ago, the palace is said to have had a unique lift for Ravana and his visitors. Ravana imprisoned Sita in one of the caves at the bottom of this humongous boulder. Sigiriya is a fifth-century fortress in Sri Lanka carved out of an inselberg, a hill of hard volcanic rock that soared high above the surrounding jungle. We spent two hours atop the rock, mainly taking photographs. We descended from Pidurangala Rock, filled with awe and a sense of accomplishment.The journey ahead seemed even more enticing as we ventured along the winding roads, heading towards our next destination.Cash-strapped Sri Lanka plunged into its worst financial crisis in more than seven decades in 2022, with a severe dollar shortage sending inflation soaring to a high of 70 percent, its currency to record lows, and its economy contracting 7.3 percent.Thanks to the growing number of tourists, Sri Lanka is now bouncing back.In Jetwing Lake, we met Kasun Pradeep Somasiri, a receptionist. He briefed us that the resort is now 50 percent occupied. “That’s a better figure now as we are recovering.”The travel and tourism sector is a significant income generator for Sri Lanka. However, the economic crisis, the Ukraine–Russia war, and China’s zero-Covid policy have jeopardised the industry.Tourism accounted for more than 12 percent of the country’s GDP in 2019 and was the third-largest source of foreign exchange reserves, behind worker remittances and the apparel industry.Sri Lanka was poised to be one of the world’s best holiday destinations due to its rich culture, wealth of natural resources, and diversity of accessible experiences.However, tourism-dependent Sri Lanka suffered its first major setback with the Easter bombings 2019. This led to the collapse of inbound tourism flows as international arrivals declined by 18 percent year-on-year, and tourist expenditure fell by 17.7 percent that year. This was immediately followed by two years of pandemic restrictions. Inbound visitors fell to just 116,600 in 2021.An acute balance of payments crisis forced Sri Lanka to preemptively default on foreign debt of over $50 billion in April 2022, triggering a crippling economic contraction with spiralling inflation.“Tourism is gaining momentum,” says Somasiri. “The British and Chinese have started to return to Sri Lanka.”January-August is the peak season for foreigners. “From December to April, local people travel for holiday purposes,” says Somasiri. Before we started the tour to other religious sites, our tour guide, Sampath Mayadunne, told us, “Don't take selfies with your back to Buddha.” Turning your back on a Buddha statue and some other religious sites to take photos and videos is a strict no-no.The most common sight across Sri Lanka is the tank cascades system, an ancient irrigation infrastructure. The system is a network of small tanks draining to large reservoirs that store rainwater and surface runoff for later use.“These infrastructures were built by its ancient kings over 2,000 years ago to solve the water scarcity in the country’s dry zone,” says Mayadunne.On day two, we travelled to Ranweli Spice Garden in Matale. This garden is famous for its rare spices and herbs. A tour of the gardens will show you the cultivation, harvesting, cleaning, and packaging process, as well as the health benefits and uses of the herbs.On the way, we saw a colourful Muthumariamman Hindu temple, boasting hundreds of detailed sculptures in a rich mosaic of colour.In Kandy, we visited the Temple of the Tooth Relic (Sri Dalada Maligawa), one of the most sacred places of worship in the Buddhist world. It was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1988.The temple sustained damage from bombings by Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna in 1989 and by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam in 1998. However, it was fully restored each time.We then headed to Jetwing St Andrew’s, a luxurious 5-star property in Sri Lanka’s hill country of Nuwara Eliya, situated at 1,900 metres above sea level. During our stay in Kandy, we immersed ourselves in the city's charm and the serenity of the countryside. On the third day, early morning, we travelled to Nuwara Eliya, the area famous for tea estates that give many Nepalis the feeling that they have come to Kanyam, Ilam, in eastern Nepal.We visited a tea factory called Damro Labookellie Tea Centre, the oldest tea centre in Sri Lanka. Due to its cold climate, it is the most important area for tea production in Sri Lanka.In this tea factory, they make white and black tea, while the green tea is processed in another tea factory and then sent to Damro.After the tea factory tour and the tea tasting, we headed to Galle, our next resting point.We encountered narrow, winding, and maze-like streets and alleys in Nuwara Eliya, known as ‘Little England’. The town has preserved almost all its British-era buildings and is calm and beautiful. On our way to Galle, at the roadside, our tour guide stopped us at the famed Sita temple, which has Hanuman's footprints and is the place where Sita, wife of Lord Rama, was held captive by the demon king Ravana after he abducted her from India.We were at Sita Eliya, a temple named Sri Seethai Amman.When we reached the Hindu temple, rich in vibrant colours and architectural elements, it was full of devotees. The water stream adjoining the temple is believed to be where Sita bathed. Large footprints are found on the stones in the stream, and there is a saying that those belong to Hanuman, who came spying to find Sita’s whereabouts.In Ella, Ravana’s waterfalls are significant in the Rama-Ravana story. The cascade charms visitors from all over the globe. The waterfall is easily accessible and is known to have hidden caves at the top, which are believed to have been used as Ravana's residence.The 25-metre-tall waterfall is a beautiful cascade that provides the perfect backdrop for a photo to remember your Ramayana trail adventures in Sri Lanka. A short pilgrimage tour ended there, and it was now time for an adventure. Though it was not part of our itinerary, our guide decided to tour us on a train ride.Though short, only six kilometres from Ella to Demodera, it was thrilling. Everyone screamed in unison like kids on a fair ride to hear the echoes in the dark every time we passed through the tunnels. The sound of the train is subtly different inside a tunnel. For the first-timer, the darkness and shouts inside the tunnels when the train passes would be scary, like a horror movie.The train we boarded wasn’t crowded, but people had already filled the doorway, ready for the scenic journey.With the shrill sound of a whistle, the train slowly pulled away from the platform at Ella, passing houses, coconut trees and green fields.As the train progressed, tourists and locals were leaning out the windows and crowding to hang out the doors. I joined the crowd and hung out on a train. A short excitement ended there.After lunch, we headed to Galle and reached Jetwing Lighthouse. As soon as our group entered the hotel, they shouted with excitement.The hotel is on a rocky outcrop three miles west of Galle. Waves crash over giant boulders in front of it and produce howling winds.We were at Galle’s 17th-century fort five minutes from the hotel on day four. In the Bay of Galle on the southwest coast of Sri Lanka, Galle Fort was built first in 1588 by the Portuguese and lavishly rebuilt by the Dutch during the 17th century. It is a historical, archaeological and architectural heritage monument that maintains a perfect appearance even after more than 436 years.We then reached Hikkaduwa Beach, a popular beach destination on the southern coast of Sri Lanka. On the way, we saw a 30-metre-high Big Buddha Statue. It is a replica of the 6th-century Buddhas of Bamiyan destroyed by the Taliban in Afghanistan. It was created using the earliest known sketches of the statue. It was built in remembrance of the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami victims.We then travelled through the 222-kilometre-long Southern Expressway, Sri Lanka's first expressway linking the capital, Colombo, with Galle, Matara, and Hambantota, significant cities south of the island.On day five, we reached Colombo, the capital of Sri Lanka. Jetwing Colombo Seven hosted us in the bustling capital. We took a city tour early morning and visited Bally's Casino at night.On day six, we returned to Kathmandu early in the morning on a Sri Lankan Airlines flight, the airline that organised the trip in coordination with Jetwing Hotels Limited, a Sri Lankan hotel chain.National flag carrier Nepal Airlines, in its previous avatar as Royal Nepal Airlines, used to operate direct flights to Colombo during the 1980s. However, the carrier suspended operations following an armed movement by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) in Sri Lanka. There had been no direct air links between the two countries for decades.In 2016, Himalaya Airlines started a chartered flight that lasted a few months due to low traffic movement between the two countries. Sri Lankan Airlines started operating direct flights to Kathmandu in August 2021.“The main objective of this media tour is to increase tourism in both countries for mutual benefit. We want to draw Nepalis for pilgrims and leisure activities,” says Nilina Pathirana, Country Manager at Srilankan Airlines in Nepal.“We have understood that Nepali travellers tend to travel to Bangkok, Vietnam, Malaysia, Dubai, and Maldives. Nepalis have quite minimal knowledge about Sri Lanka and the religious connection between Lanka and Nepal. We want to promote Nepal and Sri Lanka jointly. This will be a win-win business,” added Pathirana.The airline said it currently carries 60 percent of the passengers from Nepal to Sri Lanka and beyond destinations like Tokyo, Sydney, Melbourne, and other Middle Eastern destinations. The return airfare for a 3.5-hour-long flight starts at Rs74,000. “We have a four-night, five-day package that begins from Rs80,000, depending on the properties and extended itineraries,” says Pathirana.Nepalis must submit certain required documents for visa processing, like their passport copy and bank statement. Due to this government-to-government policy, only Nepalis must obtain a prior visa. Otherwise, Sri Lankans are required to have a visa upon arrival.“The other best thing is that Sri Lankan Airlines can be involved with the visa process or facilitate the Nepalis tourists. Our main intention is to have a sustainable market in Kathmandu and make it a daily flight,” says Pathirana. \nMundhum Trek in Koshi province in the eastern part of Nepal is a new cultural walking trail. It passes through several indigenous ethnic villages and landscapes in Khotang and Bhojpur districts. This trail goes up to an elevation of 4,200 metres to the viewpoint of Silchung Peak and takes one through the settlements of the Kirati people. This route starts from Diktel Bazaar and passes through beautiful settlements like Chakhewa, Rawa Dhap, Salpa Bhanjyang, Silchung and Hanspokhari before ending in Bhojpur. There are some hotels in Diktel but trekkers are advised to carry tents. The trail offers panoramic views of most of the eight-thousanders, including Everest, Lhotse, Makalu, Cho Oyu and Kanchenjunga mountains. The spring season, March through May, is highly recommended for the trek.Janaki Mandir Janaki Mandir at Janakpur in Madhesh province was constructed in 1874 and is a blend of Mughal and local architecture. The temple is a three-storey building and has 60 rooms, making it the largest temple in Nepal. Pilgrims flock here by the thousands to pay homage to Janaki Mandir—Janaki being the other name of Sita, the daughter of King Janak. The temple houses an idol of Sita which was found near Ayodhya, the kingdom of Ram. The marriage anniversary of Lord Ram and Sita is celebrated in Janakpur every year on Vivaha Panchami, which falls in December. In the southwest corner of Janaki Mandir is the Vivaha Mandap, which has been built at the site where the marriage of Ram and Sita is said to have taken place. Another well-known temple in the vicinity is Ram Mandir, which is built in pagoda style and is hence different from the other temples in Janakpur that generally bear resemblance to Mughal architecture. It houses a female statue, said to be of Yogamaya, which has the reputation of being one of the most beautiful images of female forms in Nepal. Other holy sites of interest include the Laxman Temple, Sankat Mochan Temple and Hanuman Temple.Kuri Village, Kalinchok Kuri village, a popular tourist destination around 150 km from Kathmandu, lies at an altitude of 3,842 metres above sea level in Kalinchowk of Dolakha district, in Bagmati province. People visit the place to enjoy the snow during the winter besides the mesmerising landscapes and splendid panoramic view of the Himalayan range. Kalinchok gets snow mainly at the end of December and the snowfall continues till the end of February or mid-March. When there is snow, it is difficult for jeeps, buses and cars to reach the top of Kuri village. Chains are wrapped around the wheels of vehicles and specially modified jeeps with highly experienced drivers are used to carry visitors. There are several hotels and restaurants in the area. The road up to Kuri has also improved over the years.Annapurna Base Camp Annapurna Base Camp trek, in Gandaki province, makes for a picturesque journey that takes you to the foothills of the Annapurna South, up to 4,130 metres above sea level. The five-day trek (seven days for slow walkers) offers rich cultural diversities, typical Nepali villages and the flora and fauna nestled at the foothills of Annapurna. The distance from Pokhara to Annapurna Base Camp is approximately 81 kilometres. It is among the shortest and most budget-friendly treks in Nepal. For Nepalis, lodging costs around $5 to $10 per day. For foreigners, the overall cost of the trek ranges from $800 to $1500 on average per person. Annapurna Base Camp trek can be done at any time throughout the year as each season offers a different trekking experience. The ideal time for the trek depends on your weather preferences and what you expect from it. However, autumn (September to October) and spring (March to May) are considered the two best seasons for the trek, as the days at the time are warm and bright with clear skies.Bardiya National Park Bardiya National Park, located in the southern Tarai belt of Lumbini province, is home to one of the most elusive and majestic animals on earth—the Royal Bengal Tiger. The park, which covers an area of 968 square kilometres, is considered one of the most important protected areas in the country. It is a prime destination for those looking to catch a glimpse of a tiger. A bit of luck and patience will offer a good chance to see the Bengal Tiger. The jungle safari also offers one the opportunity to spot Asian elephants and the greater one-horned rhinoceros. The rare Gangetic river dolphins are occasionally spotted on rafting trips along the Geruwa River, the eastern channel of the Karnali river. Besides, visitors can enjoy the homestays and explore local Tharu culture. The right time to visit the park is from mid-September to mid-December and mid-February to May.Khaptad National Park Khaptad National Park in Sudurpaschim province is a protected area in the far western region. It stretches over four districts of Bajhang, Bajura, Achham and Doti and ranges in elevation from 1,400 to 3,300 metres. The park can be visited throughout the year. Trekkers are advised to bring their tents, food and other supplies. The Nepal Tourism Board says of late, social media has been increasingly influencing Nepali travellers to go to Khaptad. Since the far-flung Khaptad National Park is still offbeat for many travellers, the area remains pristine and fresh. The seasons of spring (March-May) and autumn (October-November) are the ideal times to visit the park. The temperature ranges from 10°c to 20°c offering pleasant trekking weather. The monsoon begins in June and lasts until September and during this time, roads often become muddy and slippery. From December to February, winter brings snow and chilling winds to the park.Limi Valley \nOnce again, my heart swelled with joy when my hometown came into view.Arriving at Lalikharka after the treacherous journey through Pauwa Bhanjyang and the bustling Kanchhi Dokan, Phidim, the headquarters of Panchthar district, revealed itself like a surprise gift. My home town, Phidim, is unique in the fact that it reveals to travellers approaching it from uphill. As the vehicle descends the mountain road, it slowly comes into view, its houses and buildings recognisable for the native son.This Dashain, I undertook the much-awaited trip to my hometown with my wife Kabita and daughter Aarohi. Little did I anticipate the transformation that awaited me.The moment I got out of the jeep, I noticed that Phidim, nestled in the lush hills, has undergone a remarkable transformation over the years. As I guided my family to my home, which had suffered damages in the 1989 quake that struck eastern Nepal, I found that old, mud and stone houses had been replaced by concrete buildings. The place was vastly different from the one I remembered.Arriving at my childhood home felt like reuniting with an old friend. Navigating its nooks and crannies with my daughter, we delved into the history of the house, a symbol of my cherished memories.My wife had visited Phidim years ago, spending a month with my parents. She, too, recalled beautiful moments she had had in the town. I asked the tenant about the neighbours and acquaintances. Some had died, while others had left for good.A call to local journalist Giriraj Banskota led me to the school grounds, where memories flooded back. This was where I spent my teenage years, playing ball, learning to kick, and watching major tournaments. Here, I even encountered a group of Western climbers headed to Kanchenjunga, the world’s third-highest mountain. I remember being awed by their shiny yellow tents, headlights and strange smell. I remember practising my tutephuteko Angrezi with the climbers. Birendra Shield, an annual sports tournament named after the late king, brought ace players from various schools in Panchthar district. The district also hosted Yuba Mela, an annual three-day fair to commemorate the birthday of the king, organising football tournaments in which teams from as far as Sunsari and Taplejung participated. I never excelled at dribbling balls. A boy growing up in a seven-member family, I soon found my interest in literature. In the late 1980s, Phidim hosted a major literary festival. In the run-up to the 1990 pro-democracy protest, walls were painted with anti-monarchy slogans, local politicians were arrested. I took my family to my school, Naya Namuna Secondary School. It was Saturday, so the school was closed. I peeked through the steel gate and wall, imagining myself labouring over classes. Memories are hazy, but what I remember most is going out of the school—to quiz contests with me leading the school team, to essay competitions at the District Education Office and to play carom board, a national pastime, in a nearby shopfront. Returning to the main street, the demolition of a landmark gate made me reflect on how cities transform, shedding old landmarks for new identities. Navigating narrow alleyways, I felt like a stranger in my own hometown. Multistory buildings have emerged and roads have been paved, reshaping the town. It’s the same place with a different face, leaving me nostalgic for the Phidim of my memories.We finally reached Shivalaya temple, which I told my wife and daughter was one of my cherished hangouts. A giant statue of Falgunanda (the Kirant leader’s birthday is celebrated on November 10) stood before the steps to the temple. Though my wife suspected I came here to smoke, in reality, I visited the temple in the evening to meet friends and talk about issues that mattered most to us at the time. It also offered a panoramic view of the town (I could not take my family to Gadhi Danda, a hillock across the Shivalaya).Towards the end of my journey, I felt sad about Phidim’s lack of prospects. To my dismay, I found that people have been leaving the town in droves. Despite blacktopped roads and multi-story buildings, Phidim faces a troubling reality. The lack of quality higher education and specialist healthcare has driven people away, echoing the circumstances that led me to Kathmandu years ago. Conversations with locals confirmed a mass exodus from the town, a trend that raises concerns about Phidim's future.My conversations with familiar strangers led me to conclude that Phidim has transformed into a transit town for pilgrims heading to Pathibhara Devi Temple, which is around 255 kilometres north in Taplejung district. I met dozens of people headed to the holy site. While pilgrims see it as a stopover, for me, it was a homecoming. The realisation dawned that Phidim is, perhaps, in a state of transition, trading its rustic charm for the hallmarks of urbanisation. While I left Phidim for higher education in Kathmandu, people from rural areas have flocked to the town in search of better opportunities, bringing life and energy to the once quiet community.As we bid adieu to my hometown, I couldn’t help but reflect on the inevitability of leaving a place, no matter how enamoured one is with it. Passing Kanchhi Dokan, I pointed out Kanchnajungha and Kumbhakarna to my daughter—symbols of my childhood. Phidim, now a blend of nostalgia and change, remains etched in my heart, a testament to the intricate dance between memory and evolution. \nNepal national women’s cricket team defeated Sri Lanka Women Development Squad by two runs in their third T20 practice match in Surrey Village in Maggona on Tuesday.Indu Barma’s team bundled out Sri Lanka Women Development Squad, who were chasing 113, for 110 in 19.5 overs, with Kabita Joshi taking 3-16 and Kritika Marasini returning the match figures of 2-16.The win also prevented the host team from sweeping the three-match series. Nepal had lost the first T20 warm up game by 33 runs and the second by four wickets.Balasuriya top scored for Sri Lanka Development Squad with 38 runs off 36 balls, while Nethranjali made 26 facing 20 deliveries. Sri Lanka collapsed early when Kabita Kunwar trapped opener Karindi leg in front in the third over and Chhetri ran out Wijesinghe in the fourth over. Balasuriya steadied the ship, and with support from Nethranjali, the host team looked destined for another victory.But once Joshi dismissed Balasuriya in the 16th over and Nethranjali in the 18th, the Lankans’ hopes of completing a clean sweep faded.Skipper Barma also took a wicket.Earlier, Nepal posted 112-6 from 20 overs after choosing to bat first, thanks to Rubina Chhetri who revived Nepal’s innings after suddenly collapsing in the eighth over.Samjhana Khadka (10 off 20) and Sita Rana Magar (15 off 23) added 31 runs for the opening wicket to give Nepal a good start. Nepal found themselves in big trouble at 33-3 when they lost three quick wickets, including both openers, to Thennakone (2-21) in the eighth over.Bindu Rawal and Barma offered some resistance but the skipper too fell in the 13th over that left Nepal reeling at 52-4.But Chhetri partnered with Rawal to defy the Sri Lankan bowlers and guided Nepal past 100. Chhetri hit 37 runs off 26 balls, while Rawal contributed 20 off 31 balls.The victory will be a huge boost for Nepal ahead of their ACC Women’s T20 Asia Cup, which is set to begin on July 19.Nepal have been drawn in a tough group alongside the tournament’s most successful side and defending champions India, two-time runners up Pakistan and the United Arab Emirates.Nepal, who are still looking to register their first win at the biennial competition, will open their Asia Cup against the United Arab Emirates on Friday. They face Pakistan on July 21 and India on July 23.Nepal are making their third appearance at the Asia Cup. \nGerman player Thomas Mueller announces his retirement from international football after 14 years with the national team, following their exit from the European Championship.\nDefending champions Argentina grasped their 16th Copa America title after a 1-0 defeat over Colombia in extra time.\nSince the outbreak of conflict in Sudan in April 2023, over 10 million people have been displaced, with hunger cited as the primary driver of migration.\nDeadly protests over public sector job quotas in Bangladesh lead to university closures, police deployment, and political unrest.\nSix Vietnamese foreigners were found dead from cyanide poisoning in a Bangkok hotel room, with the suspected killer also deceased, due to a debt dispute and a swift investigation is underway.\nNepal's book market is flooded with unauthorized translations of renowned international authors, infringing their copyright and harming the industry's reputation, despite the existence of copyright laws.\nBharat Budha, chair of Putha Uttarganga Rural Municipality’s ward 10, knows that many youths from his village have made it to the United States via ‘tallo bato’—backdoor route—and that many are still on the way. He also knows that eight of them have been deported from the country and that they have lost a cumulative Rs45 million in the process. The deported youths say that they returned home empty-handed after facing unspeakable ordeals and lost Rs6 million each on average.The Tak village in Rukum East—a close-knit settlement of 425 houses—was considered the Maoists’ ‘base area’ during the insurgency. Village youths who reached the US through illegal routes and got deported have lost an estimated Rs40 million. The number of those who returned without completing the journey and the amount they lost remain unknown.To get to the US, the youths have taken loans at up to 36 percent interest per annum from their relatives and village landowners. In Tak village, at least one person each from half of the households has gone abroad, Budha said. “Youths started going to America about six-seven years ago,” he said. “If they could gather enough money, the whole village would try to go to the US.” Budha’s own son had reached the US illegally in 2017, spending Rs3.2 million.During the insurgency, outsize slogans of revolution would adorn the walls of houses in the village. Hoping for a better life, people from all walks of life helped out the Maoists. But now, village youths are paying the agents to illegally get to the US—a country that the Maoists used to call their ‘enemy’, an ‘imperialistic force’. This has cost the Tak village much and in multiple ways.Death of a dreamSome of the deported youths have chosen to flee the village altogether, burdened with debt and creditors’ pressure. At least five such families have already left, said a resident. The family of Ram Budha was one of them. On April 28, 2015, Ram, who had returned to Nepal after working in Malaysia for eight years, took the illegal route to the US. He travelled through arduous trails for months and finally arrived in the country. Upon reaching the country, he was detained and had to stay at the detention camp for 27 months. When his refugee application was rejected, he was deported to Nepal in mid-December 2019. He lost Rs4.5 million in the process. He now owes over Rs6 million to creditors. “After the creditors began to put pressure on me, I couldn’t live in the village peacefully,” said Ram, who currently runs a vegetable farm in Tarakeshwar, Kathmandu.While those who got to the US through illegal routes and fortunately got refugee status there narrate their stories with pride, those who have been deported or returned from half-way have tragic tales to tell.Nanda Kala Gharti, who lives in a small stone house on the upper flank of Tak village, spends her days in melancholy. Her husband, Dhanlal, had chosen to take the illegal route to the US, and Nanda Kala, a mother of four, is living with the repercussions of his decision. Dhanlal had got into the US after a six-month long arduous journey and was detained immediately. He had to spend four years in the detention camp, before he was deported to Nepal. He had already lost Rs6 million.Nanda Kala said they now have an insurmountable crisis in their hands. Pointing to her son, she exclaimed, “When will he grow up, go abroad and pay back the loans!”Dhanlal himself tried to go to Croatia once and spent 15 days in Kathmandu for the process. But after he was turned down, he returned home dejected. “Now we will submit the passport to another agent [for Dhanlal’s trip abroad],” Nanda Kala said. “There’s no point staying here.”Stories that echo each otherThe situation in Sisne Rural Municipality is similar to that of Putha Uttarganga. Here, one can hear plenty of stories of those who have tried to go to the US and those who are fighting refugee cases there. Krishna Regmi, chair of the rural municipality, personally knows seven people who have been deported from the US.Gangaram Khadka, a resident of Sisne-3, runs a bee and chicken farm. Like other young men in his village, Khadka had headed off to the US via an illegal route on 27 March, 2018. He had reached the US via the New Delhi-Moscow-Barcelona-Bogota-Panama-Costa Rica-Nicaragua-Honduras-Guatemala-Mexico route. When he finally arrived in the US, he was detained and had to spend 11 months in detention. He was deported on 15 March, 2019. He had handed over Rs3.2 millions to the agent and spent Rs2 million to fight the case to become a refugee. “It’s not possible for me to pay back the loan while working in Nepal,” he said. “I aim to pay back some interest and head off abroad again.”For six months after Khadka was deported, he had anxiety and headache, he said, adding the three people from his village who were deported like him are also struggling with their mental health.Tikaram Pun, a 40-year-old resident of Bohora village in Musikot-4, is also haunted by his past journey. In September 2017, he reached the US after crossing 17 countries with the help of organised human traffickers. Of the 41 people in his group, 31 were from Rukum East and Rukum West, he said. Pun, who was detained on arrival in the US, spent 24 months in a detention camp. His refugee application was also refused and so he was deported along with eight other Nepalis. “When I returned, I started having mental health problems. I still suffer from them,” he said. Pun is under pressure from creditors and relatives to pay back the Rs9.2 million loan he had taken for the task.Those who died on the wayA group of 10 Bangladeshis and seven Nepalis, including Rupak Bohora of Bafikot-3 in Rukum West, were on a mission to reach Costa Rica through Colombia, Caribbean Coast, Capuragana and Panama. But while they were crossing a sea, their boat capsized. As many as 12 died in the incident, including six Nepalis. Rupak’s wife, Geeta, learned about the incident only after six days, on 25 June, 2021.“I still don’t know what exactly happened,” said Geeta, who had been married off at age 19 and is now a mother of two daughters. The only thing she knows is that Rupak has died and she is now all alone. And that she has Rs5 million in loan taken for Rupak’s trip. She showed a picture of her husband on her phone to this scribe and said, “I only have memories.”Lack of political will and legal remediesThe concrete bridge over Chewang river is on the edge of Tak village. On the walls of the bridge are paintings of political theorists like Marx, Engels, Lenin, Stalin and Mao, and the iconic slogan, ‘Workers of the world, unite!’, below them. But the slogan appears to be at odds with life in the village. Given the phenomenon of illegal travels to the US through the help of organised human traffickers, the whole village appears to be emptying. Neither the local governments are concerned about the phenomenon nor are the political parties paying attention.Puniraj Gharti, chair of Putha Uttarganga Rural Municipality, said though the trend is worrying, there’s nothing he can do. “How could we stop them from making the trip when they are struggling to make a living in the village?” he said.Krishna Regmi, chair of Sisne Rural Municipality, said that the vicious cycle of poverty started after marijuana farming was banned in the country. Then the Maoist insurgency added to the woe, forcing youths to migrate. The signing of the peace agreement in 2006 didn’t herald any change in the economy either and youths are struggling to get jobs. Organised human traffickers are cashing in on this sorry state of affairs, Regmi said. “Meter byajis [usurious lenders] are also promoting this phenomenon,” he added.The phenomenon is equally rife in Dang’s Tulsipur and Ghorahi. Ramesh Kumar Pandey, chair of Ghorai-15, says that even though many heading to the US are swindled, no complaints are filed at the ward office. “Only those who attempt to go to Saudi Arabia or Qatar file the complaints,” he said.One can infer from Pandey’s statements that the families of such illegal travellers don’t want to publicise the ordeals of their family members. On the one hand, agents threaten them to not publicise the issue; on the other, they fear they themselves would be punished by law.According to the Anti-Human Trafficking Bureau, as many as 178 Nepalis, including 174 men, have been deported from the US in the five fiscal years after 2018-19. Of them, the highest 49 are from Rukum while 37 are from Dang. The data doesn’t include those who returned after making it to the half-way or those who have been fighting the legal battle in the US for refugee status. But this data is enough to show that many such youths are from the ‘base areas’ of the Maoist insurgency.SSP Jeevan Shrestha, chief of the bureau, said that data on the number of such victims and the amounts they have spent is hard to collect since complaints are rarely filed with the police. “This is human trafficking but for a lack of law, we are still compelled to launch the cases as per Human Trafficking and Transportation (Control) Act 2074 BS,” Shrestha said. “The Act provides a maximum penalty of Rs250,000 for the offenders and 50 percent of that as compensation to the victims.” Without specific law, police also invoke the theft and organised crime act to punish the offenders, he added.On the one hand, police receive no complaints; on the other, the phenomenon sees no control.Bhaskar Gautam, a political scientist, says the rise in cases of human trafficking in the insurgency’s ‘base areas’ is due to the political system’s abject failure.While the Maoists raised issues related to livelihood, nationalism and a new kind of democracy to fuel their war machine, after the peace process, it is livelihoods that have been hit the hardest, Gautam said. “The traditional way of life and economy took a hit during the insurgency,” he said. “Developments after the peace process also failed to address that. What sprang up was organised human trafficking.”(Mahesh KC in Rukum East and Durgalal KC in Dang contributed to this report.)This report is prepared in collaboration with the Center for Investigative Journalism-Nepal. \nGyanumaya BK had been suffering from severe backaches for a while. The resident of Pokhara-15, BK visited the Metrocity Hospital in Srijanachowk seeking treatment five months ago. The 69-year-old, who works as a labourer, has already spent over Rs50,000 on follow-up checkups and medications.BK spent eight days in the hospital in January and has been paying off loans she had taken to pay her bills and for follow-up visits to the hospital. Had BK been aware of the Health Facility Operation Standards-2020, which private hospitals must adhere to, she wouldn’t have had to borrow money to pay her medical bills. As per the regulations, hospitals must set aside 10 percent of their total beds to the underprivileged and needy.“I didn’t know hospitals were required to provide free treatment to those who can’t afford hospital stays,” BK said. “But even if I did, I would have to fight to get the service as the hospital won’t willingly offer me the service.”The Pokhara-based 50-bed hospital’s Chief Executive Officer Gyan Prasad Aryal admits that his hospital does not adhere to the mandate. “We don’t have explicit information from the health ministry on the Health Facility Operation Standards-2020,” said Aryal. “Moving forward, we will follow the instructions.” The hospital authorities say they give a 10-15 percent discount on the final hospital bill as opposed to dedicating 10 percent of their beds and free treatment and medications to the less privileged. Hospitals with 15 beds come under the jurisdiction of the local units while those with up to 50 beds fall under the ambit of the Provincial Health Directorate. Likewise, the Provincial Health Ministry oversees health facilities with over 50 beds.However, no regulatory body has data on whether health facilities are following government rules, especially Health Facility Operation Standards-2020. But it is an open secret that most private hospitals in Pokhara are not following the regulations.Pokhara Municipality Health Department Officer Yadunath Baral, Kaski District Health Officer Bhim Prasad Poudel, and Province Health Director Khim Bahadur Khadka all admit that local hospitals disregard the regulations. “Our monitoring and inspection is also lax, that’s why most hospitals ignore the rules,” he said. He says lack of manpower hampers effective inspection. “Our manpower is enough to conduct inspections in other districts, but not in Kaski, which has many private hospitals,” he said. “We need more people for that”. According to Baral, although the hospitals claim to offer a certain discount on final bills to the needy, they are unable to show the record of the discounts provided. “The hospitals claim they give discounts, but most hospitals have not even been able to show us the proof,” said Khadka. “Legal actions should be taken against the hospitals that fail to submit a monthly report on the free services for the poor. More importantly, they must be liable for flouting government standards that aim to benefit the poor.” The Provincial Health Directorate also does not have any data on the directive’s implementation at hospitals with more than 50 beds.The department’s chief of health services Dr Ramesh KC says that they have been working on updating information of health services in the Gandaki region. “Hospitals have failed to submit their mandatory monthly reports. We will seek that information when they come for new permits or permit renewal,” KC said. There are 27 privately-owned hospitals within the Pokhara Metropolitan City and 39 in the Gandaki region. Bharatpur Metropolitan City in Chitwan in Bagmati Province is also called the ‘medical city’  as it is home to 23 private hospitals with a total of 1,200 beds. Additionally, there are multiple large-scale government hospitals and two medical colleges—Chitwan Medical College and College of Medical Sciences—that also provide medical services. Had the Health Facility Operation Standards-2020 been followed by the 23 private hospitals, 120 patients would have received free health services every year, according to Durgadutta Chapagain, chief of the Chitwan Health Office.“Although the hospitals claim they provide the services, none have been able to provide convincing proof. Instead, we found them giving such discounts to patients who are close to hospital operators,” said Chapagain. “Our department validates the permits for new health facilities and re-registrations for hospitals with a 25-bed capacity. We have asked such public health service providers to put up posters or stickers reading ‘Discounts for the needy’ on the hospital premises so that patients know what services they can get on discount.”Meanwhile, Bikram Adhikari, Secretary of the Private Hospitals Coordination Committee in Chitwan, claims that the regulations are impractical. “There are a few services that hospitals can provide free of cost. You cannot expect hospitals to provide all services for free. That’s why there is a need to amend the existing regulations,” said Adhikari.The monitoring bodies’ inaction and lackadaisical approach to ensuring that public health services are accessible and affordable to all makes private hospitals blatantly ignore government mandates.Bharatpur Metropolitan City’s Deputy Mayor Chitrasen Adhikari says that although the metropolis is aware that private hospitals must allocate 10 percent of their beds for free treatment of poor people, the metropolis administration has yet to devise a monitoring mechanism. “We have not taken any steps towards that end, but we will soon,” he said.Just like Pokhara and Chitwan, Biratnagar is also plagued with the same problem. There are 32 private hospitals currently in operation in the metropolis. Deepak Bhattarai, statistical officer at the municipality’s health office, asserts that none of the health facilities met the set requirements. A monthly report submitted by the Biratnagar-based Nobel Medical College and Teaching Hospital, which has 750 beds, stated that the hospital had provided the said concession to more than 400 patients. “However, the report did not clarify how many of the 400 patients were provided free hospital beds and the services that come along with the beds, and how many were given discounts on their hospital bills,” Bhattarai said. “We found that hospital reports also include concessions provided to patients who sought outpatient, emergency, and X-ray services.”The hospital’s director Narayan Dahal claims to be following all government instructions. He says 10 percent hospital beds are set aside for needy patients who are not charged any treatment fees, while 10 percent of service seekers also get discounts.Although the Biratnagar Metropolis has directed all health facilities under its jurisdiction to allocate free beds and provide free services to the needy, inform service seekers about the government-provided services, and submit a list of all patients who have received the services, the directive is ignored more often than followed. According to Bhattarai, medical establishments must get a letter from the local unit before making any upgrades or purchasing any equipment. “But the hospitals have been found presenting fake documents in order to acquire such permits,” he said. “The metropolis has refused such permits to 12 private hospitals in the current fiscal year.”Butwal Sub-Metropolitan City in the Lumbini Province has also taken no concrete step to ensure private hospitals adhere to Health Facility Operation Standards-2020. Despite having the authority to carry out inspections, the sub-metropolis’ apathy has deprived hundreds of needy patients of various government services. The sub-metropolis with 17 wards has more than two dozen big hospitals in the Butwal bazaar area itself. Not one of them adheres to the government’s health regulations. But the sub-metropolis is yet to monitor these hospitals. Yubraj Pandey, chief of Butwal Sub Metropolitan’s health department, says they have been unable to inspect medical institutes due to a lack of a proper set of rules.“I have just been transferred here. Discussions are underway to prepare legal requirements,” he said. Private hospitals in Butwal only began filing their reports two months ago after a joint meeting, informs Chief of the Sub Metropolitan’s Education and Health Department Mitramani Khanal. Twenty-year-old Suraj BK of Sarawal Rural Municipality-2 in West Nawalparasi got into a motorcycle accident on April 26. He suffered injuries on both his legs and was taken to Zenus Hospital and Research Centre in Butwal. Suraj was handed a bill of Rs 70,000 for treatment but he did not have the money to clear the bill and sought the hospital’s help. “The hospital refused to provide any discount. They in fact refused to discharge me. I got my discharge papers only four days later after I paid almost Rs 100,000,” he said. “I had to get a loan to pay the hospital bills as my father, who is a farmer, did not have that kind of money.”Dr Sharda Singh, the hospital director, said Suraj did not qualify for a discount as he did not have a recommendation letter from the local unit. “Patients have to get a recommendation to avail of free services at private hospitals but Suraj could not bring one,” she said. “I was in the hospital bed for four days. I could not have secured a recommendation from the local unit in that state,” said Suraj. Ishwari Prasad Chapagain, a civil society leader of Rupandehi and a member of the Consumer Interest Protection Forum, says private hospitals in Butwal are more interested in making money than helping those in need. “They do not follow government mandates. They act as if they have to bear the expenses of providing free service to the poor when in fact they get tax rebates and such for such services,” he said. “The sub-metropolis also does not do the needful. Everyone is corrupt including the city officials.”  \nIn an adaptation of musical chairs repeatedly being played in Nepal since 2015, two performers take turns installing the third contestant on the throne after hush-hush parleys and midnight settlements. The winner this time is Khadga Prasad Sharma Oli, the unchallengeable supremo of the CPN-UML and the widely accepted chieftain of the Khas-Arya supremacists. Sher Bahadur Deuba, the chair of the Nepali Congress, figuratively carried Sharma Oli from his mansion at Balkot to the official quarters of the Prime Minister at Baluwatar. There is nothing dramatic about the political development and no surprising political shift in the power-sharing deal between the second and the largest party in Parliament under the leadership of the former. In Nepal, traditions of parliamentary procedure don’t apply, and conventions routinely fall by the wayside. The observance of ethical practices of democracy is often an exception rather than the rule.After the installation of the ethnonational chieftain as the chief executive, the jubilation in the dominant community is perhaps justified. The triumphant tone of the headline in one of the major newspapers in Nepali was unmistakable: “Ousted by mandamus, mandate reinstates”! Another editorialised it as an “opportunity for Oli” as if he hadn’t missed and misused one too many over three decades. A few other bigwigs of public life were equally celebratory, though mercifully less euphoric, about the return of Sharma Oli to the centre stage for the fourth time in less than a decade. A significant section of the dominant community is convinced that Sharma Oli is their best hope for the institutionalisation of the supremacist order that the 16-point conspiracy signed by four parties in 2015 had sought to establish for the continuation of Khas-Arya hegemony. In 2017, President Donald Trump coined a neologism with a midnight Tweet: “The state of our union was … covfefe.” The state of Nepal in the same year was so convoluted that I had to come up with an adjective to describe the prevalent supremacist atmosphere as “Oliological arguments that are neither logical nor illogical; but are doggedly obdurate, stubbornly bigoted, spiritedly jingoistic, determinedly prejudiced, indomitably chauvinistic, and unswervingly xenophobic in tone, tenor and intent.” All such propositions are beyond being true or false as they pander to the pleasurable prejudices of the existing order.Communal consensusNominally a democratic organisation espousing nationalistic socialism, the NC has always been a big tent party that offered shelter to the politicos swearing allegiance to a broad spectrum of ideologies. One could be a monarchist dyed in yellow, a pink socialist or a gilded capitalist, yet find ample space under the charismatic leadership of Bisheshwar Prasad Koirala. The definition of the “Nepali nation”, however, was common to all personal convictions of every politician.In keeping with the spirit of the anticolonial movements of the 1950s, the nationalistic aim of BP was the production of national unity with the voluntary erasure of diversities within the country. When Bedanand Jha of the Terai Congress talked about the political dimension of Pahadi domination, BP pitted Madhav Regmi against him and succeeded in mobilising the Madheshis to defeat all Madheshi contenders in the electoral fray. Benimadho Singh, a political novice, was picked to defeat the towering politician Bhadrakali Mishra. Nirgun Yadav happily vacated a constituency where Yadavs were in the majority to ensure the victory of Saroj Koirala.After the royal-military coup of 1960, the monarchists began a concerted campaign to defame the NC by questioning their nationalist credentials. The party was so much under pressure to prove its allegiance to the Pahadi identity that many of its Madheshi, Janajati and Dalit cadres began to flaunt ‘Nepali’ as their surname. When BP was the towering leader of South Asia, he could be seen in public in the white Churidar and black Sherwani ensemble. After adopting Daura-Suruwal upon becoming the Prime Minister, he was never seen in anything else, even when he was denied entry into the royal palace because the colour of his coat differed from the officially sanctioned shade for commoners.When Krishna Prasad Bhattarai went to New Delhi as the first Prime Minister of the country after the restoration of parliamentary democracy, he confronted a question about the exclusion of the Madheshis from the Nepali Army with an irrelevant retort that the Madheshis weren’t recruited as Gurkhas of foreign armies. Back home, the chutzpah of a descendant of the family priest of the Gorkhali royal family was celebrated as nationalistic. The long and short of the ideological examination is that the monarchists, the democrats, the Marxists and the Maoists subscribe to the same definition of Nepali nationality: The ethnonational supremacism of what has been constitutionally described as Khas-Arya community through the contested constitution of 2015. Due to the ethnonational solidarity around Nepalipan, perhaps a large section of the NC finds the control of Sharma Oli more comfortable than some of their own secular or somewhat less communal leaders.Alternative aspirationsThe Madheshis came to the streets in 2007 mainly because the Maoists and the mainstream parties had failed to address their aspirations of identity, representation and self-rule through the interim constitution. Divided between the territories under the control of Gorkhali expansionists and the East India Company (EIC) after the ratification of the treaty of Sugauli in 1816, the Madheshis continued to be a bewildered nation. Gorkhalis treated Madhesh as a productive territory to sustain their military. In the cost-benefit analysis of the EIC, the rate of return on the investment of holding on to the conquered territories in the flood-prone flatlands below the Churia ranges wasn’t worth the trouble. Abandoned by losers and winners alike, the Madheshis were left to their own devices for almost two centuries.Unlike the Pahadis in Madhesh, the Madheshis aren’t settlers in an alien land. The history of the Gorkhali conquest is hardly two centuries old, while the ancestors of the Maithils and the Awadhis have lived in the region for millennia. However, they hardly fall under the indigenous category in the sense of the Malaysian term bumiputera. The Tamils of Sri Lanka had to bear the burden of their association with British colonisers, but the Madheshis were at the forefront of struggles against Ranarchy and the absolutist regime of the Shahs.Despite sharing a racial lineage, the same people fought and got their separate states on the basis of religion and culture in India, Pakistan and Bangladesh. The Madheshis have no such collective memory of animosity with people across the international border. They are considered a permanent minority in their own land due to the hegemony of the ruling community.Apart from power-sharing, constitutional amendments to strengthen Khas-Arya supremacy appear to be the main agenda of the Sharma Oli government. Paradoxically, the Madheshis will probably be called upon to protect the constitution that they once burnt to register their protest because not doing so will create conditions for fresh confrontations and a further increase in state violence. Contemplating the fate of permanent minorities under the regime of a hegemonic majority, political theorist Mahmood Mamdani postulates, “… violence can be especially ferocious when one community comes to believe that it is the state.” Ruefully moans Cecil Day Lewis: It is the logic of our times, No subject for immortal verse – That we who lived by honest dreams Defend the bad against the worse. \nI recently attended the International Disability Arts Festival 2024 in Bangladesh, organised by the British Council. As a wheelchair user and disability advocate, I found the experience life-changing.When I arrived in Bangladesh, I didn’t see people with visible disabilities on the streets. No wheelchair users or people with visual impairments were in sight, and the overall accessibility was as bad as, if not worse than, what we have in Nepal. In Kathmandu, people with physical disabilities use modified scooters; in Bangladesh, I saw none. So, I was sceptical initially, thinking this might be another development sector’s attempt to appear inclusive without any substance.Breaking barriersMy doubts started fading with the first play I saw: “71 in Silence”. The play was about the Mukti Juddho, or the Bangladesh Liberation War, featuring wheelchair users and people with hearing and visual disabilities as actors. Their performances resonated with immense talent. Seeing them perform such complex movements and scenes, some even getting out of their wheelchairs and dancing on the floor, was inspiring. It was a big reminder of what can be achieved when barriers are removed and opportunities are given. Throughout the festival, actors with severe disabilities continued to take centre-stage not just as token representation but as lead performers. One of the standouts was the adaptation of William Shakespeare’s A Midsummer Night’s Dream, which was full of music and vibrance. The nearly house-full audience was captivated; the audience’s reaction to this play was unlike anything I'd seen in Nepal. There was a clear sense of awe and respect, not pity or discomfort. The audience were genuinely moved by the performers' talent and their storytelling. It made me wonder how we could create such an atmosphere of appreciation and understanding back home.One thing that impressed me was the plays’ creative use of sign language. In Nepal, we often have sign language interpreters standing at the side of the stage, making it difficult for deaf audiences to follow the action and the interpretation simultaneously. Here, the sign language was integrated into the performance. Characters would take turns interpreting sign language, making it a part of the play rather than a separate element. This made a big difference in inclusivity and accessibility. Incorporating this into Nepali theatres could be game-changing. But there are challenges. We would need to train the performers in sign language, which will take time and resources. There might also be resistance from those who are used to the traditional way. But the benefit—a more immersive experience for deaf audiences and a more inclusive show overall—will be worth it.From discomfort to confidenceI also met and talked to some performers, including a lead actor who walks using his hands and knees instead of a wheelchair. He is a final-year bachelor’s student and manages nine cows as part of his family’s livelihood. Acting has always been his passion, but he never had the chance to pursue it until this festival. Before becoming an actor, he felt uncomfortable about people staring at him while walking to his college. Now, with newfound confidence, he proudly returns those stares. He shared how even actors without disabilities look up to him as a mentor, which has been emotionally uplifting. Seeing so many people with disabilities from all over Bangladesh participating in these plays made me realise the importance of inclusive arts. It’s not just a leisure activity; it’s a tool for empowerment and changing societal perspectives. It also made me think of all the artists with disabilities in Nepal we are not tapping into. How many talents are we missing because we haven’t created the space? His journey from discomfort to confidence proves what happens when we open the arts to people with disabilities.The power of inclusive arts extends beyond Bangladesh. Traditional narratives that portrayed disabled characters as objects of pity or inspiration are being challenged. Instead, we're seeing more nuanced and authentic representations. However, progress is uneven. While some countries are making strides in inclusive policies for cultural spaces, others lag. The debate about disability inclusion in theatres is evolving, but it's clear that we need more than just accessibility ramps and sign language interpreters.Enabling the disabledIn Nepal, we have made some progress in making theatres more accessible to audiences with disabilities, introducing ramps and sign language interpreters. These are necessary but feel like tokenism—a box to tick rather than real inclusion. What is missing is the development of artists with disabilities themselves. Unlike what I saw in Bangladesh, I rarely see performers with disabilities on stage in Nepali theatre. We must go beyond making theatre accessible for audiences with disabilities and focus on developing artists with disabilities. This means training programmes, opportunities for artists with disabilities to lead creative projects and challenging the idea that disability is a barrier to creativity.I have been working with various people and organisations since 2019 to increase the cultural participation of people with disabilities in Nepal. Last year, I worked with the British Council to produce “Beyond the Norm”, a toolkit to make programmes and events more accessible to people with disabilities. It’s an easy-to-use document that all cultural practitioners should use. This year, my organisation is working with “Birds of Paradise” theatre, UK, on a disability theatre production. These are small steps through which I hope to support disability inclusion in the culture and arts sector as an audience and, more importantly, as creative professionals.One of the most impactful moments for me at the festival was a play in which the actor I met earlier was tangled in a rope and trying to move forward while others were pulling him back. That powerful scene portrayed how society holds people with disabilities back. His question “All the things you do are normal and beautiful, but what we do is different and abnormal. Why?” left the audience speechless. \nThe first edition of the Nepal Living Standards Survey (NLSS-I) 1995-96 aimed to create “unique opportunities to assess the poverty situation in the country and carry out many other research works by providing a large database at a single reference point.” Simultaneously, the survey operation aimed to contribute to the capacity building of the then Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS) in conducting sample surveys. In a sense, it was an experimentation and training opportunity created for the next generation of sample survey researchers. This, therefore, had obvious caveats on the robustness of its outcomes and usability of inferences.Last month, the National Statistical Office (NSO), the rebaptised CBS, published a report of the fourth edition of the Survey (NLSS-IV) 2023-24. The original objective of the NLSS to “assess the poverty situation” does not seem to have changed. However, in nearly three decades of exercises that published three editions—1996, 2004 and 2011—this government entity seems to have barely learned to conduct such sample-based surveys, improve its inferential credibility, and maintain research integrity while working with a disproportionately small sample of a large population.Unrepresentative samplingNo doubt, sample surveys, as against population surveys, are risky and can provide only indicative inference even if they are implemented with utmost professionalism and high precision research. Otherwise, they suffer from self-selection bias and inferential misrepresentation due to underrepresentation of data variation. Besides, creating a mini sample from an already available population dataset to inquire into the topic that the population sample itself could carry out better is a redundant exercise and a misuse of resources. First, the NLSS rituals on top of the National Census do not add any value to better understanding the country's socioeconomic realities. Second, the authenticity of small-sized sample surveys like the NLLS can be established if, and only if, their statistical outcomes are consistent with those of comprehensive surveys like censuses. The NLSS exercises have failed on both counts.For the NLSS-IV, data was collected from a sample of 9,600 out of 6.761 million households, or 0.14 percent. When it is disaggregated into selected 15 geographical domains, the average number of households surveyed in each domain is only 640. This is certainly a gross underrepresentation to statistically infer anything meaningful. For example, the NLSS-IV claims the proportion of households in Nepal receiving remittance income has reached 76.8 percent. It also argues that it is a dramatic increase from 23.4 percent in 1996 and 56.8 percent in 2011. Nevertheless, it is not only inconsistent with the National Census 2021 data but also does not reflect the actual ground reality. Inferential flawsThe Census 2021 states that the total number of individuals absent from home, possibly to be in a foreign country, is only 2.169 million. It is next to impossible to receive remittances by 5.192 million (76.8 percent of 6.761 million households recognised by the Census) households sent by only 2.169 million migrating individuals, including seasonal absentees. Among them, even if only one individual from each household is considered out of home and remits the earnings back, only 32 percent of the households are likely to receive any kind of remittance. The direct positive correlation between the outmigration of individuals and remittance income can no way be undermined or ruled out.There were similar inconsistencies in NLSS-2011 and Census-2011. The Census stated that the population away from the country then was only 1.921 million, while the NLSS-III claimed that nearly 57 percent of the 5.7 million households benefitted from the remittance receipts. As such, which inferences and conclusions should people believe in and use—the Census or the NLSS, both published by the same agency? There seems to be a great deal of confusion even in defining what essentially constitutes the 'remittance' for the purpose of this report.Even in determining the poverty line and poverty-related indicators—the sole stated objective of the NLSS exercise—both the data and inferences are messy, to say the least. It has adopted a new poverty line using 2022/23 as the base year. The updated line marginally increases the minimum income bar. A Nepali citizen is now classified as poor if her annual per capita total consumption expenditure is less than NRs72,908 annually, or Rs200 (USD 1.5 at 1 USD=NPR 133) per day. The report, at one instance, claims that Nepal has seen a significant reduction in poverty headcount over the last 12 years, from 25.16 percent in 2010-11 to 3.57 percent (vis-a-vis 2011 inflation-adjusted poverty line) in 2022-23. In the next paragraph, it says, “20.27 percent of the population in Nepal lives below the new poverty line”.The definitional relation in practice between the 'headcount' and the 'poverty line' is that the 'national poverty headcount ratio is the percentage of the population living below the national poverty line.' Then how do the claims that poverty declined to 3.57 percent while 20.27 percent of the population still languish below the poverty line by earning only USD 1.5 dollars a day stand together? Regardless of these purely data doctoring or data cooking machinations, the critical question is: Whether the poverty rate actually declined in reality or not.Extrapolations and excusesThese are only a few examples of research by a government agency that is dependent on a small set of data while resources are disproportionately used in clever tabulation and preparation of politically convenient reports to show progress in critical topics like poverty reduction. No research finding should be only a circus of data overexploitation and far-fetched extrapolation like this. Whenever the discrepancies in research outcomes of government agencies are called out, the instant response is to point fingers towards methodological differences or biased perceptions. Also, the “we are the government” mindset runs deep to prove their findings as sacrosanct and beyond question.Nepal is pathetically handicapped in data-based research. There is a clear dearth of institutions in the country, academic or otherwise, that have the technical capacity and financial resources to carry out large-scale, nationwide research to counter the spuriousness of many such government surveys and research outcomes. International development partners, for instance, the World Bank, which has been supporting the NLSS endeavours since the beginning in 1995, have hardly paid any attention to the fact that the effective presence of autonomous research institutions out of government influence can better contribute to national policymaking. A plethora of survey-based research norms and practices, specifically in government-owned agencies, must change now. \nNepal is not even halfway through this monsoon, and the rain has already brought deadly floods and landslides. As per official records, from June 10 to July 14, a total of 108 people have died, many more have been injured, and 3,552 families have been displaced across the country. The death toll is likely to mount as more bodies surface from the recent tragic Simaltal incident on the Mugling-Narayanghat road section (also called Madan Ashrit Highway), where a landslide swept two buses carrying 65 people into Trishuli River last week. It is unfortunate that our efforts to prevent human loss have been far from satisfactory. Constant politicking, lack of preparedness and a culture of dismissing expert research and suggestions on road construction all make monsoons a perfect storm of disasters. Take the Mugling-Narayanghat road. The road was widened without factoring in its geographical vulnerability and landslide risks, and the landslides there have only gotten worse in the past few years. Moreover, haphazard roads built above the major roads throughout the country have put many lives in danger, as happened during the Simaltal incident. As per a Setopati report, the debris flow brought about by the road construction in the settlements above the Simaltal area reportedly resulted in the incident.Geologists have consistently raised concerns about the risks associated with the highway; however, their words have fallen on deaf ears. In June of this year, the landslide risk assessment flagged 11 areas on the highway as zones that needed immediate study and 25 areas as prone to landslides. Similarly, according to Kaski district’s Disaster Response Plan (as reported by Himalkhabar), 25 settlements are in danger of flood and landslide in Pokhara Metropolitan City. As a part of their disaster preparedness, each district is mandated to prepare a disaster response plan. Despite this, when the time comes to act, they lack the necessary human resources, equipment, or budgetary support to prevent disasters and rescue people. We don’t have to look far to see how the country’s disaster preparedness has failed—Simaltal has received major attention in terms of rescue yet, as of now, neither the buses that were swept away nor most of those missing have been found. When it comes to dealing with disasters, our authorities have always adopted a wait-and-see approach. The Home Ministry, responsible for overseeing national disaster preparedness, issued a notice on preventive measures, including suspending the plying of vehicles at night in high-risk areas, only after the tragic incident on the Mugling-Narayanghat highway. These measures could still prove beneficial, but we need a long-term solution and pre-planning. As local governments are still ill-prepared to handle pre-disaster preparedness as well as post-disaster rescue efforts, it is up to the federal government to equip the community level bodies with enough budget and equipment. We have had enough of these life-threatening disasters. Even though it is already late, all three levels of government must heed the experts, engineers and geologists when constructing or widening roads. The much-needed slope stabilisation through bio-engineering should be done on the Mugling-Narayanghat highway and other risky paths without further delay. The governments should also prioritise rigorous monitoring and follow-ups on road construction. We cannot afford to lose any more lives to these disasters. \nKP Sharma Oli begins his fourth term as prime minister with a bit of baggage. Most infamously, during his third term, when the time came to hand over his prime ministership to his coalition partner as earlier agreed, Oli chose to dissolve the House of Representatives—twice—rather than voluntarily give up power. Thankfully, the Supreme Court stepped in to avert an untimely election. Rightly or not, Oli has over the years built a reputation for wheeling and dealing and for surrounding himself with yes-men. He is not someone comfortable reaching across the aisle. In fact, his stubborn and acerbic nature has made it easy for others, including his coalition partners during previous terms, to take offence. At 72 and in iffy health, Oli is also seen as someone whose time in Nepali politics has come and gone. On the external front, too, challenges galore. In recent times, ‘China’s man in Nepal’, as dubbed by the Indian media, has had a difficult relationship with New Delhi. Of course, he must be lauded for taking a dogged stand against the 2015-16 Indian blockade. But then Oli started spouting all kinds of nonsense like claiming that Lord Ram was born in Thori of Nepal rather than Ayodhya of India, unnecessarily needling the powerful BJP establishment. These are big hurdles no doubt. But they are not insurmountable. During the latest negotiations with Congress leaders, for instance, he is reported to have assured them that he has ‘matured’ and will refrain from taking juvenile steps like dissolving the House on a whim. He is also someone strongly wedded to the idea of a two-party polity, a strategy that suits many in the Congress just fine. (Whether it suits the country is a different thing.) As the agreement between the two big parties in the lead up to the formation of the new government is yet to be made public, it is hard to make definite predictions. Yet if Oli can channel his strong character to use the over two-thirds majority in the House for productive purposes, he can get a lot done. On India too, Oli was for long known as someone with personal rapport with top Indian leaders—and he still has the confidence and capacity to take personal initiative to mend fences. Disliked in Delhi and mistrusted in Beijing, Oli nonetheless will have his task cut out maintaining an increasingly difficult balance between the two neighbours.The priority for the new Oli government, just like it was for its predecessors, will be to breathe some life into a stagnant economy. A message of political stability given through a two-thirds majority will help. Yet both in and outside the country, there is a justified suspicion over the longevity of this ‘unnatural’ Congress-Communist coalition. Oli as prime minister must be ready to make some tough personal adjustments in order to stop the cycle of instability in government. This means not just reining in his natural tendency to rebuff critics and rely on a small coterie on all vital matters but reaching out to coalition partners and even the opposition parties as often as he can. In fact, if Oli tries to go it alone, before long this coalition too will implode. Whether while trying to revise the constitution, making important appointments, or crafting a budget, his government must be seen to be striving to engage the widest section of relevant stakeholders. The onus is on Oli to prove his critics wrong.  \nPrime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal is all set to go today. After being taken for a ride turn-by-turn by a distant third CPN (Maoist Centre) led by Dahal, the two big parties in Parliament—the Nepali Congress and the CPN-UML—have joined hands to form a coalition government. And with this, Dahal, who remained at or around the power centre for almost a decade even with his party performing poorly in polls, is pushed to the periphery—at least for a while. The overzealous commentaries about Dahal being thrown off the grid of power may, however, be premature. As per the current constitutional provisions, coalition culture is here to stay. And considering how adamant the political parties are in sticking to their morally corrupt politics, no one can tell if the impending Congress-UML coalition stays for the next three months or three years. As Dahal goes today, there does not seem to be much point assessing how well his coalition with the UML fared in just four months of its existence. It takes decades, even centuries, to build a nation. The five-year term of Parliament is the minimum required for a set of leaders to make some impactful decisions for the country. There certainly are provisions for changes in the government, even in the midst of the parliamentary term, but these should be exceptional cases. What we have got, however, is a perpetuity of the coalition culture. It is this perpetuity that has halted the nation-building process for decades now. With the same set of three old men playing the hot potato game around power, nation-building has become a staccato performance at best. Just as one performer comes to the stage and starts his performance, he is pushed to the sidelines in the middle of the act.Pushpa Kamal Dahal will perform the last scene of the four-month act that was his coalition. He will come on stage, search for UML chairperson KP Sharma Oli among the audience, and call him a betrayer. He will then look for the Nepali Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba and blame him for being power-hungry. Oli and Deuba will then take the stage by turns and blame Dahal for trying to take them for fools. Such acts have been repeatedly performed, with the same set of plots, performances and actors. There is certainly a new actor on the block, a television presenter who thought he had had enough of shouting out of the small screen. He stepped out of the screen into the field and competed with the old guards whose noses he wanted to break—as his infamous saying went.The moment Rabi Lamichhane came to the spotlight after an impressive electoral showing, the masks he had worn all along started falling off. After a while, he became the fourth old man in the club of politicians who see fault in everyone else besides themselves. Only that Lamichhane was louder, more contemptuous of the media, and as directionless as the other three when it came to envisioning a future for the nation. As Dahal is forced to step down and Oli is about to take the helm, it is worth pondering if this sordid cycle of drama will end anytime soon.  \nThe July 1 midnight deal between the Nepali Congress and the CPN-UML, the first and the second largest parties in the federal lower house respectively, turned national politics on its head. Pushpa Kamal Dahal was thrown out as prime minister and KP Oli assumed the country’s leadership. The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal asked Maoist Centre leader Ram Karki, who has cultivated an image of a rebel within the party, on his reading of the event. How do you see the CPN-UML’s rebuffing of the CPN (Maoist Centre) and formation of a new government with the Nepali Congress?If you see it from the perspective of those who believe in parliamentary democracy, this is wrong. In the system, the largest party is believed to have the public mandate to run the government and the second-biggest to be the main opposition. A weak opposition makes for a weak parliamentary system. The system isn’t an ideal one for us [communists]. The two parties have made a mockery of the system they advocate for. Why didn’t the Maoist party that championed progressive agendas implement them when in government?We should admit that we lost the moral authority to implement and execute those agendas. We could have implemented those ideals by mobilising peasants, working-class groups, and people from oppressed communities, but our grip and connection with them have loosened.Why did the party and the leadership distance itself from the working class?The state has two arms—coercive and persuasive. The Maoists succeeded in using coercive force. But you can’t use this all the time. One has to use persuasive force most of the time. When we joined mainstream politics, we were the leading political force. We were in power. At the time we should have changed our education sector. For that, we should have worked on our curriculum and trained teachers. Our educational system is guided by patriarchal and feudal values. We need to orient people to questioning and following science. The party couldn’t do so. Had we done so, we would now have a critical mass with us. The Maoist leaders lost the moral ground. When you preach lofty ideas, the public won’t listen to you. They instead watch your lifestyle. Earlier, the Congress and the UML leaders, who were outsiders in Kathmandu, got ‘polluted’ when they worked in collusion with the capital’s elites. We, too, got ‘polluted’ by hobnobbing with the two parties. The working class and oppressed communities that had helped the Maoist party fight the state felt betrayed. The leaders and the masses are separated now. The Maoist party was the true leader of the progressive agenda such as inclusion, federalism, secularism and republicanism. These ideas are still valid, but the party failed to honour them. It failed because it lost its strength and disconnected itself from the class it fought for. It tried to become the leader of all people. The oppressed communities felt betrayal, while the other classes didn’t accept the party because of our past. Do you think the Congress and the UML will try to undermine progressive agendas enshrined in the new constitution?They have also sold lofty ideas to the people in the past. A counter-revolution under the two parties’ leadership is not easy. Their rank and file won’t accept it. The Congress, in fact, is not only a political party but a collective where you find radical Hindus as well as hardcore secularists. It stays strong as long as it works as a unified force of various groups. But when it imitates communists and tries to be a rigid cadre-based party, it loses its space and strength. So the Congress can’t lead a counter-revolution against progressive ideas. Counter-revolution is not easy, but the reactionary forces have certainly succeeded in regaining their space.Observers and politicians from rival parties claim that the Maoist Centre is now in an existential crisis. Do you think it can make a comeback?More importantly, the space that used to be occupied by the Maoist party is now left unoccupied.Can’t the UML or other forces make inroads into that space?The UML is a tried and tested force. Even the Maoist Centre is now described as a tested force. How can older forces enter that space? A force mightier than the Maoists can emerge. As a Maoist party member, I still vow to rejuvenate and revive the Maoist Centre. I am trying to convince my fellow comrades to do that. But my voice hasn’t prevailed. I have been presenting my papers in the party’s general conventions. We still have a strong belief that sooner or later, we will prevail because we are raising valid issues.Various leftist groups have at various times tried to create a strong, united left political force in Nepal. Do you think ideas like socialism and communism still attract the youth?Some rebel voices within our parties take some initiatives to raise our collective voice to build pressure on party establishments. But this has been limited to theoretical debates and failed to translate into politics. A theory or philosophy is like an iron plate, while crafting a tool from that iron is politics. We haven’t been able to transform our ideas into political action. If a leader floats a political agenda, the people first study the leader’s integrity. If a leader with a strong moral authority proposes an idea, people trust and follow it. If Gandhi was wearing a suit and telling people to wear handwoven khadi, Indian people wouldn’t have followed him. Similarly, if Mao was using clothes, watches and vehicles from developed countries while preaching for simplicity, Chinese people wouldn’t have followed him.Our people don’t listen to our leaders because they don’t see the leaders walk the talk. Youths are always attracted by adventurism; they are receptive and sensitive to certain incidents. Now, they aren’t following us because they don’t find any adventure and newness in our ideas. If we do some soul searching and correct ourselves, the Maoist Centre still can lead the process to complete the unfinished progressive agendas. Is that possible under the current Maoist leadership that has lost its credibility while staying in power for long? Will the people trust them?People will judge them based on their actions. If the Maoist leaders were more credible, there would be no space for the Congress and UML to come together. Either one or the other force would seek the Maoist party’s support. They wouldn’t have dared to ignore the Maoist party that led progressive issues in the recent past. They were emboldened because of the Maoists’ diminishing influence. Therefore, we have to correct ourselves in practice.You said that the classes and communities the Maoist party used to lead now have no leader. Can new outfits occupy that space?The traditional parties—the Congress, the UML and the Maoist Centre–don’t have any strategic vision on where they want to see the country in 20 years. The new forces are worse. They hit a ball and wherever it reaches, shift the goalpost there. They carry the goalpost with them. New forces with such visions can’t replace old parties. History shows that Nepal has witnessed political upheavals in a gap of 10-15 years. In the past such tsunamis have changed the political systems. Now we have seen sparks of movements but they are scattered. New forces need an ideological weapon. The Maoists forgot to sharpen their ideological weapon over time by holding ideological debates and upgrading themselves. Another is intra-party democracy. A political party that doesn’t practise intra-party democracy can’t enforce democracy in society.From the perspectives of intra-party democracy, the Maoist Centre is probably the most undemocratic of major political forces. Why?In the Congress, you are free to speak, but you don’t have a say in execution. Communist parties are too centralised. The structure conceptualised around a century ago in the context of wars and other contexts hasn’t been updated. Even new parties are run by the party chiefs imitating the anomalies of traditional forces. A leader is praised if s/he takes immediate decisions, gets them endorsed from the party committees and implements them swiftly. Those who say they have to first discuss the issue in party committees are described as weak. Such a trend is killing intra-party democracy.Do you think the Congress-UML coalition will succeed?A coalition between the parties that don’t even have a common minimum programme is a coalition of opportunists. They don’t have a moral ground either. On ideological grounds, the Congress still cites the late BP Koirala because no other leader of the party has worked on the theoretical front for decades. Such is also the situation with communists. They still cite the theoretical works of the late Pushpa Lal Shrestha. The current alliance is not a principled one, it’s a collaboration between opportunists. So, don’t expect anything better.How do you evaluate the outgoing government?It did nothing for the class it represents. The prime minister’s secretariat might have prepared a list of ‘100 important achievements of the government’. But what is the government’s priority? It failed to even give skills to those going abroad in search of work. They would have found better work had we given them valuable skills. Not only the outgoing one but all the previous governments have failed. The Congress-UML alliance has said it wants to review the constitution and amend the charter when necessary. How do you see this idea?This will be backtracking from the present constitutional roadmap. It is dishonest to create hindrance in implementing the federal system and then suggest the system is a burden. Such moves would give space to those who want to raise questions on republic and secular systems. There is a strong faction that lobbies for Hindutwa in the Nepali Congress. It is no secret that the Congress and the UML were not in favour of republic, secular and federal systems. But later, they rode the popular wave. But they have still not internalised it, and there are some regressive elements in both the parties but the people, who have come too far, won’t backtrack.Don’t you think the coming together of Congress and UML may ensure political stability?Instability is okay for me because stability may not necessarily be good for a country like ours. See, a single leader has been ruling a party continuously for over 30 years. What if they rule the country in a similar way? Look at some countries where a single leader has ruled for decades. The current arrangement is better than such stability.Will the Maoist party chairman and prime minister, who didn’t even appoint a minister from a Dalit community, have the moral authority to again champion the agenda of the oppressed?Appointing a minister is again an ornamental approach to appease certain communities. What we should do is ensure the participation of oppressed communities in policymaking.But party chair Dahal may again seek ways to get back to power. Will he pay attention to these issues?We should stop this chase for power at all cost. We will say this in our party meetings. We should accept the reality that we have just 32 seats and so we won’t get sufficient space to implement any important programmes even if we join the government.The way your party chief remained in power for over 18 months using various tactics, was it right?If you see it through a parliamentarian’s lens, it looks quite smart. If you see it through a Marxist perspective, just becoming a prime minister is futile if you can’t implement your policies and strengthen republicanism and participatory democracy. \nThe Nepali Congress and the CPN-UML last week reached an agreement to form a coalition government under the leadership of UML chair KP Sharma Oli. As a part of the package, they also aim to make certain changes to the constitution. The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal asked Pradeep Gyawali, deputy general secretary of UML, the reasons behind the coming together of the two largest parties, how they plan to run the government and to review and amend the constitution.Many are seeing the Congress-UML alliance as something unusual. What factors brought the two largest parties together even as there is no crisis-like situation or a special task such as constitution writing?Definitely, in normal parliamentary practice, the two largest parties don’t forge an alliance to run a government. The party that gets the biggest mandate leads the government, and the other big party remains in the opposition to make the ruling force accountable. In Nepal, the country’s two major forces, the Congress and the UML, have also joined hands in certain junctures for certain purposes. They worked together to make the constitution in 1990, to conduct general elections in 1999, to complete transition after the 2006 people’s movement and to bring out the constitution in 2015. We felt a need for a similar collaboration this time around. After the November 2022 elections, we saw three alliances in our parliament. At first, Maoist Centre chair Pushpa Kamal Dahal became prime minister with our support, but he failed to abide by the agreement sincerely. He changed the coalition within a month. The subsequent alliance between the Congress and the Maoist Centre lasted for a year. He again sought the UML’s support. Within four months of the March 4 deal with the UML, he started yet another gameplan to join hands with the Congress under the pretext of forming a national consensus government. It was quite unusual for the prime minister himself to instigate instability in the government. He publicly boasted that he had a ‘magical number’ [32 seats in the House of Representatives]. He thought that he could employ the tactic of ‘use and throw’ with the two largest parties and rule the country for the full term. He was completely indifferent to people’s plight, the country’s pressing issues and service delivery. This was the height of irresponsibility. So, the UML and Congress leaders concluded that the time had come to intervene to ensure political stability and service delivery and make sure public frustration doesn’t get out of hand. Did external factors play a role? Recent statements by UML leaders suggest that the party has taken it seriously. When national forces are weak, the neighbouring countries and international forces become more cautious, even more so given Nepal’s geo-political situation. Some of their concerns are valid. They fear political instability in Nepal may have an adverse impact on their genuine issues. We have to take this naturally. Second, it is no secret that we have a long legacy of facing external interference. Sometimes such interventions are carried out covertly and sometimes overtly. Therefore, national forces should be strong. Some political parties and leaders have a tendency of seeking external forces’ support to fulfil their vested interests. In return, they serve the external forces’ undue interests. Formation of a government is a purely domestic affair, but in our case sometimes it also becomes an issue of geopolitical interest. It is said that the UML was spooked when it learned that Prime Minister Dahal had reportedly approached the Congress for a new alliance. This reportedly happened after Dahal returned from New Delhi following Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s swearing-in.We were taken by surprise when the Congress leaders told us that the prime minister had reached out to them with a proposal to form a national consensus government. We were informed about the development from the leaders of the main opposition party. When we reached the March 4 deal with the prime minister, we thought he came to us with a commitment to course correction. Based on that, we supported him almost unconditionally. We didn’t bargain while sharing ministerial portfolios and didn’t talk about the prime minister’s term. We had even thought of allowing Dahal to run the government for the full term if the government functioned well and people were satisfied. We hadn’t even imagined that we would have to think about changing the coalition within four months.We definitely had certain grievances such as a lack of consultation with our party and our lawmakers while preparing the government’s policies and programmes and while allocating budget. Our party chair brought up this issue with the prime minister. But our concerns weren’t addressed. They had already started to ignore us. There were several issues with the prime minister, but we were committed to the partnership. But they had already gone too far. Fortunately, the Congress leaders didn’t accept the offer and instead raised critical questions about the rationale behind the proposal. Basically, the Congress didn’t trust Prachanda ji [Dahal] and came to us. It concluded that Dahal didn’t come with the intent of solving the country’s problems but to manoeuvre between the Congress and the UML.Besides jointly running the government, constitution amendment is another major aspect of the latest Congress-UML deal. What are the provisions the parties want to change?There are four major objectives of this agreement. Safeguarding national interest; strengthening economy; improving governance and service delivery; and ensuring political stability. A debate has started that some constitutional provisions are not helping maintain political stability. What we have said is that it’s been almost a decade since the promulgation of this constitution. Some of its provisions are yet to be implemented. On the other hand, provincial governments complain that they have not been able to work in a full-fledged way because the federal government has still not made some laws they need. So, first, we will undertake a comprehensive review on the progress in the course of implementing the constitution and the challenges we faced in the past decade, among other things. While doing so, we will find out if there are provisions that have posed challenges in maintaining political stability and running a stable government and suggest amendments accordingly.So, it’s not only about the amendment but also about review, assessment and recommendation for amendment, if there is a need. Even if the amendment process begins, it will be limited to ensuring political stability and won’t touch other aspects of the statute. There is no need to over-react. For instance, some Maoist leaders are trying to make it a political issue by describing it as a regressive move. That is wrong.So as per the two-party deal, the statute will be reviewed but not necessarily amended?Yes, whether to go for amendments will depend on the findings of the review. No constitution in the world is perfect. Its success largely depends on the practitioners. So, first we have to differentiate between the role of the constitution and the practitioners. It is true that our society is divided over certain provisions of our constitution. All these issues will be considered, but the fundamental features of the constitution such as democracy, inclusion and federalism won’t be altered. Our priority would be to only remove hindrances in making the system more functional, people-oriented and productive.Of late, people are debating the electoral system, provincial structure and secularism. Will these issues also be dealt with?Federalism is a new system for us. In fact, it is still an in-the-making process in Nepal. We have to note some timelines while analysing the performance of provinces. After the provincial and federal elections in 2017, the first provincial governments were formed in 2018, and they worked for around three years in a stable way. With small cabinets, they worked genuinely to strengthen the provincial system. At the time, most provincial cabinets had around six to seven ministers. They weren’t severely criticised at the time. The wrong trends in the provinces started with the division of the then Nepal Communist Party and the fall of the NCP-led governments at the centre as well as provinces. We saw the trend of horse-trading in provinces. Small parties made unjustified bargaining for ministerial portfolios, chief ministers started splitting ministries and increasing the number of ministers in their cabinets. Also, the November 2022 polls again gave a fragmented verdict, further augmenting the instability and anomalies at the provincial level. So, the problem is the way we are handling things more than the provincial structures. The time isn’t ripe to seek an alternative to the provinces. As far as the electoral model is concerned, we included proportional electoral (PR) system after long debates and discussions. Based on three general elections held after 1990, a conclusion was drawn that the first-past-the-post (FPTP) model couldn’t properly represent the historically under-represented sections. The premise is still valid. Based on the achievements, we may exclude certain communities from the list. But that time hasn’t come. Two questions raised over the use of PR are valid. Is the system really doing justice to the strata and class of the society for which it was introduced? This is the question not about the PR system but the leaders who use it. Similarly, some questions: Is proportional representation required in executive as well because representation is basically vital for policy making? The forms and modalities of the PR system might be discussed, but no one has even thought of removing the inclusive system.Similar is the case with secularism. The spirit is to make the state patron of all religions in the country. However, some sections of society have often tried to misuse and misinterpret the new constitutional provision. They try to interpret secularism as openly allowing rampant religious conversion, and some have made it an excuse to attack the age-old Sanatan faith. For instance, if the President or prime minister visits Lumbini, gurudwara or a shrine of any other faith on certain occasions, that is taken positively, but when they visit Pashupatinath Temple, a section of people raise questions. These activities have made some people think that these attacks on our Sanatan faith are taking place because of the secular system. There is no problem in the constitutional provision because the statute added an explanatory note that states, “‘secular’ means religious, cultural freedoms, including protection of religion and culture handed down from time immemorial.” But some extremist activities have given wrong impressions.Some experts believe the problem of fragmented mandate can be addressed by increasing the threshold required for a political party to be eligible to get PR seats, which can be done by amending laws. Will the Congress-UML alliance opt for this?Yes, this is one feasible option. I am in favour of this. As per the existing provision, a political party can secure seats under the PR category by securing 3 percent votes in the federal parliament and 1.5 percent votes in provincial assemblies. If a political organisation doesn’t even represent 5 or 7 or 10 percent of the population, what can they contribute to the country? You do politics to represent a sizable population and get a public mandate. Otherwise, the presence of such groups would only promote unreasonable bargaining and instigate instability in governments. This can be one of the agenda of the discussion between the two parties.This time, leaders have made it transparent that chiefs of the two parties will lead the government on a rotational basis. But why have other details of the agreement not been made public?There hasn’t been topic-wise discussions on specific provisions. The broader understanding is to review and assess the implementation aspect of the constitution and move ahead based on the findings of the assessment. We have also made it clear that such an act will be guided only by the objective of ensuring political stability and we will not go beyond that. Who will undertake this type of constitution review?We haven’t worked on it in detail. We haven’t reached any understanding. Naturally, inputs will be taken from the constitution makers, experts on constitutional law and politicians involved in this field. But no decision has been made on its nitty-gritty.The Rastriya Prajatantra Party that wants to revive the Hindu kingdom was the first party to welcome the Congress-UML deal while the Maoist Centre has accused Congress and UML of making a regressive move. So don’t you think this affair is tricky?I don’t think the political parties will touch the issues that the RPP talks about, such as reinstatement of Hindu kingdom and dissolution of federalism. No one is thinking about that. Also, the questions raised by the Maoist leaders have no meaning. They are only trying to make a political agenda.It also seems that the Congress and the UML floated this idea of reviewing the constitution to make a case for the two largest parties to form the government.That’s not true. This question undermines the spirit of this agreement. If this system fails, people will raise questions mainly to the leaders of the Congress and the UML, not Prachanda. It’s not only about running the government. We were already in the government and it isn’t a big deal for the Congress to return to power. If democracy fails, the democratic forces will lose the most. So we are genuinely working on this. The Congress and the UML are historical rival forces in Nepali politics. How can the two work together in government?It is true that the Congress and the UML are the two major competitors of this country. But we have some converging factors. First, we both believe in a broader democratic framework. Sometimes, the Congress may give more emphasis on liberal values while we may push for more socialism-oriented programmes. But the common ground is democratic values. We also have the experience of successfully carrying out certain tasks jointly. We may have some friction but we also have experience of managing bitter intra-party fighting as well as inter-party rivalry.How will the ministerial portfolios be shared in the new coalition?We haven’t reached any agreement in detail. As we aim to make this a ‘national consensus government’ we are in favour of accommodating other parties. So it will depend on the number of parties that join the Cabinet. Our only concern is that ministerial allocations should be done in a way that doesn’t weaken the prime minister in order to ensure that the head of the government can deliver.How can a government without the Maoist Centre and some other parties be called a consensus government?We have to wait for that. Leaders of political parties that fiercely criticise the government also join the Cabinet under one or other pretext. Some political parties seemingly cannot exist without being in the government.  \nIn the Secondary Education Examinations (SEE) conducted this year, over 52 percent of students failed to graduate to grade 11. The National Examination Board had enforced the ‘non-graded’ category from this year. The underperformance of the majority of school students has stirred a fresh debate about the test system. The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal sat down with former National Planning Commission member Usha Jha, who led the committee that recommended the government to adopt the letter grading system.How do you analyse the SEE results published on Thursday?People have reacted to it with shock, not me. In fact, on the basis of the teaching system that is being practised in our schools, I think the results are good. We get the results based on what and how we teach students. Over 52 percent of students have been categorised as non-graded. We need to identify and address the causes behind the bad results. I have heard some people blame the letter grading system. This is wrong. A form of letter grading system was already there. We only suggested an upgraded form of the system. If we start blaming the system, we won’t find the real cause of the problem. What may be the real causes that you are hinting at?The first is the poor quality of teachers in our country. A form of letter grading system was there even before. But it had two loopholes. First, the government took an approach whereby all students would pass. That gave an impression to the students that they don’t need to study hard. That degraded the quality of their education. Second, there was a system of giving marks based on the students’ performances in theoretical and practical exams. Of the total 100 marks, the practical exams made up 35 marks. Most students were given maximum marks in the practical exams. That helped them get higher grades even if they didn’t do well in theoretical exams. This system encouraged students to neglect theoretical studies. That has caused huge damage to our education system. The letter grade system introduced this year has closed those loopholes. But the letter grading system requires a learning environment. The system was introduced without adequate preparation for its effective implementation. Also, the Covid pandemic disturbed preparatory works at the time. We should have drastically improved classroom teaching practices, and trained teachers across the country because their teaching methods are outdated. They weren’t trained on the grading system. They give lectures and encourage students to memorise while the letter grading system requires a thorough process and encourages result-oriented learning. It doesn’t prioritise marks. Our teachers and schools lacked the capacity to implement the new system. Teachers weren’t trained and prepared. Even now, most teachers don’t know what the letter grading system is. The system is necessary to make our students compete in global markets.While we upgraded the system, we didn’t upgrade the schools and teachers. Our teachers engage only in routine and formal responsibilities such as completing textbook courses before the examinations. This system should be properly internalised not only by teachers and students but also school management, palikas [local units] and parents of the students. Only then can it be effectively implemented. These are the major reasons behind the poor results. How is the students’ performance evaluated in the letter grading system?First, teachers should study a lot. They take reference of the subject matter from the textbook and teach students giving a broader perspective of the matter. They have to engage the students practically on the issue. The students should be regularly evaluated based on their participation and response in study and activities. The teachers should teach them and constantly monitor whether they are learning and making progress. The marking should be based on that. So, in this system, the examination starts from day 1 and everyday activities contribute to their marks. It also takes other activities such as behaviour, understanding, presentation into consideration. Therefore, it is called a regular assessment system based on a thorough process, unlike the traditional three-hour-long yearly examination method. If the teachers aren’t competent to carry out these activities, this idea can’t yield good results. They badly need capacity enhancement. The pedagogy should be remodelled.What was the rationale behind the decision to implement this system?One reason was to upgrade our education’s standard on par with the international standards and make our students fit for global markets. In the course of formulating this policy, we undertook a comprehensive research of international practices. Based on that evidence-based research, we submitted a report to then education minister Giriraj Mani Pokharel. The government studied and endorsed it. Basically, this system was introduced with an objective of upgrading our education system in the changed context. But we lacked preparations to implement this idea.We will make a mistake if we change this system. I heard that the education minister [Sumana Shrestha] decided to make some changes in the policy and allow all non-graded students to sit for chance examinations, whereas the system says only those students who secured non-grades in two subjects can retake exams for the same subjects. There is no point in changing the method to favour even the students who have failed in all the subjects. She should have made it clear what factors made her change the criteria overnight. I cannot understand why the minister made the decision in a haste without considering its impact.In fact, our next step should have been capacity enhancement of teachers. The minister took some right decisions such as separating teachers from political parties. But an incumbent minister changing a system that was implemented by a previous minister would cause a problem. She could have formed a panel to conduct a study to find if the letter grading system is the main cause behind the students’ underperformance. But changing a policy through an order didn’t look good.Results show our students are very poor in mathematics, science and English. What could be the reasons?This is unfortunate. We saw similar trends in previous years as well. Mathematics and science are becoming more challenging. One reason is the lack of sufficient teachers for these subjects. Also, some teachers are under-utilised. Some teachers don’t go to the schools. So special measures need to be taken to manage teachers mainly for these subjects. Otherwise, we will have similar results in the coming years.The committee under your leadership recommended that those getting a GPA below 1.6 have to choose technical courses and those willing to study Grade 11 must score above 1.6 GPA. What was the idea behind that recommendation?The idea was to end the situation of halting students’ study and activities because of their lower grades. We have a government body in the form of the Council for Technical Education and Vocational Training (CTEVT) which has been offering dozens of vocational training based on the needs and interests of people. So our youths can join a suitable CTEVT course. We need more people in vocational fields. Skilled people aren’t available in the country. A large number of people working in technical fields in Nepal are from India. We included the provision in consultation with CTEVT officials. Minister Giriraj Mani Pokharel had also prepared a broad plan to implement the letter grading system and integrate the vocational part in our education system. The present government should improve the education system by enhancing teachers’ capacity and encouraging youths to join vocational training to fill the gaps in the employment market. Are the infrastructure and resources available in our education system sufficient to implement the grading system?Some schools lack even essential resources while in some we find misuse or underuse of resources. So, our education ministry should carry out a comprehensive mapping and find where teachers are required, where they are underutilised and where they are idle. Then, the government can make optimum use of the teachers and make additional investment on need-basis. Such an approach will yield better results. In general, our academic institutions lack resources as there is a trend of allocating insufficient budgets for the education sector. Yes, the letter grading system needs more investment. We have to work on teachers’ capacity enhancement and to provide learning materials to students. When you make an activity participatory, you certainly need resources and investments.Do we need to review our teacher recruitment process and our pedagogy in the universities that produce teachers?The government can consider new requirements while recruiting teachers and train them accordingly. Also, we need to update our curriculum and pedagogy for courses such as BEd and MEd to produce quality teachers. I have doubts about the quality of our graduates, post-graduates and even PhD holders due to the poor teaching and learning environment of our academic institutions. There is a need for more coordination and collaboration between the government and universities to address such issues.In the end, I want to stress that the government should adopt a clear and consistent policy and avoid ad-hoc decisions. The letter grading system is the best and we should push for that despite the challenges in its implementation. Just that it should have been enforced after enhancing teachers’ capacity. The problems we have now are due to lack of preparation. \nThe government’s recent decision to recall ambassadors, particularly Nepal’s envoy to India, just ahead of Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal’s visit to New Delhi, courted widespread controversy. What are the takeaways of the prime minister’s Delhi visit? What is the progress in implementing the trade and transit agreement signed with China and with the BRI projects? Thira Lal Bhusal of the Post sat down with Rupak Sapkota, foreign affairs advisor to the prime minister, for some insights.The government’s decision to recall ambassadors from 11 countries at once has come under heavy criticism. Why did the government take such a decision?In general, it has become a practice of sorts to recall incumbent ambassadors and appoint new ones after changes in the government or in the ruling coalition. This has both merits and demerits. The country’s foreign policy doesn’t change with a change in government. But every government and coalition has its specific policies, programmes and priorities. Therefore, even other countries make changes in political appointments as per the government’s priorities. Our case is a bit different. Ruling coalitions are frequently changed, and so are ambassadors. As there is a high chance of our politics being governed by coalitions given our electoral system, it has become necessary to establish a rational system on ambassadorial appointment. Either the political appointees themselves should voluntarily quit the job and return home just like vice-chair and members of the National Planning Commission do. Or there should be a consensus among major political forces to allow our ambassadors to serve out the full term.The second option of allowing ambassadors to serve out their term sounds better, doesn’t it?Definitely. Some initiatives have been taken with the objective of making our diplomatic appointments more prestigious, merit-based and better-managed. The government in 2019 introduced some criteria on ambassadorial appointments. We have to put more effort into ensuring that our ambassadorial appointees have the capacity to effectively carry out diplomatic duties. Once we establish a system of appointing envoys based on merit and not out of political biases, we can create a situation of allowing them to serve for the full term. Then, a change of coalition wouldn’t affect their continuity. We need to develop such a political consensus, given our geopolitical sensitivity.But the ambassadors appointed in recent years and their activities in host countries have lowered the bar of our diplomacy.We have seen rapid and huge changes in power equations in the world. In view of that, we can see some countries have appointed former ministers and even prime ministers as envoys to the countries with whom they have vital relations. They also appoint such personalities as envoys for a special mission. So, we have to think about ambassadorial appointments from different perspectives based on the changed context. It is high time that all the political forces and leaders agree on a basic point that those who have in-depth understanding and expertise of the field and can work for the best interest of the country will be appointed the country’s ambassadors. If the individual is competent, the person’s affiliation to a political party may not be a problem. But whether the person can work in the best interest of the country must be considered before appointment.But the government itself doesn’t seem serious about maintaining diplomatic decorum. For instance, the June 6 Cabinet meeting decided to recall the ambassador from India just days ahead of the prime minister’s New Delhi visit. There were also reports that the prime minister made the decision reluctantly due to pressure from coalition partners. What is the real story?It is nothing more than a coincidence. There were discussions about making changes in the ambassadorial positions in line with the March 4 changes in the ruling coalition. But it was deferred as the government needed to accomplish some important tasks and convene events such as the investment summit. When the government decided to change our ambassadors, it just happened to coincide with the prime minister’s visit to New Delhi to attend the swearing-in ceremony of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. It was a coincidence. Despite the decision, the ambassador had sufficient time to properly conclude all his engagements and duties there. The way he facilitated the process during the prime minister’s visit doesn’t reflect any misgivings about the government’s decision. So, it should be taken as a course that is in keeping with our tradition. In recent decades, other countries have given top priority to economic diplomacy, but the selection of our envoys and their activities doesn’t reflect that. Why aren’t we thinking in that direction?Yes, diplomacy in the past used to be one-dimensional, or it was conducted mainly by one particular ministry—the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. These days, many other ministries are engaged with international agencies. Economic diplomacy, labour diplomacy, climate diplomacy and security affairs have become crucial. We have to increase coordination, cooperation and collaboration among relevant agencies to make our international relations more fruitful and in line with the policies and goals set by our government.We have seen profound changes in terms of approaches, perspectives and dynamics of diplomacy in recent decades. All countries have started to give more importance to the competence of diplomats also in view of the increased geopolitical competition and rivalry seen between world powers. Rapid innovation in science and technology has not only eased our lives but also added challenges. We have to handle so many diplomatic engagements. Similarly, the number of international forums where we have to engage are increasing. These days, multilateral diplomacy and engagements have become as important. Even minilateral forums have started to play vital roles in international relations as the world powers have adopted multiple strategies to create their spheres of influence. In the meantime, the role of public diplomacy has become influential. So, a diplomat today must be dynamic and efficient enough to grasp the international situation, understand the sensitivity of the host country, articulate our country’s views efficiently and work in national interest. Therefore, it has become vital to be extra careful while selecting ambassadors.You talked about better coordination but we don’t see any correction in the practice of bypassing the foreign ministry while working with international agencies.Definitely, the foreign ministry is our focal point for all international relations conducted by a ministry or agency of our country. There should be no dispute about that. We need to make the foreign ministry more resourceful. Then, the ministry will have more capacity and efficiency to handle issues related to security, finance, labour and climate.Why have we failed to maintain reciprocity in terms of diplomats’ relations with the leaders of host countries? For example, our ambassadors in some capitals don’t get to meet the host leaders for years while the foreign envoys in Kathmandu can meet our prime minister and foreign minister directly and instantly.We have to see it from two perspectives. One is the power structure. In international relations, we can see the reflection of the asymmetric power relations between the big powers and other countries. The more developed and resourceful country’s influence in a host country can be seen and felt. Second, despite being an envoy from an underdeveloped or a small country, one can have diplomatic relations based on the principle of sovereign equality. It depends on the individual diplomat as well.In Kathmandu, we often err when dealing with foreign envoys. We have to decide what level of importance to give them. Therefore, some initiatives have been taken to correct and maintain consistency by implementing a diplomatic code of conduct that aims to integrate all activities through the foreign ministry. Foreign envoys will follow the system if we implement it consistently, irrespective of changes in the government. For that, there should be a political understanding at the national level.Let’s move to Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal’s recent India visit. Though it was mainly to attend the swearing-in ceremony of Indian Prime Minister Modi, he held some important political meetings. What are the takeaways from the visit?The visit was important from bilateral, regional and international perspectives. Traditionally, foreign affairs was described as an extended form of domestic affairs. But these days, international affairs have influence over domestic affairs as well. So such meetings and dialogues at the prime minister’s level are important. They exchanged views in a very cordial atmosphere. Of late, we have maintained bilateral dialogues at the political level on a regular basis and that has helped remove misunderstandings. Our prime minister’s emphasis is to hold bilateral dialogues both at the political as well as diplomatic levels in order to settle differences. India has taken this spirit positively.Second, the two prime ministers discussed how to expedite the implementation of the agreements reached between Nepal and India during Prime Minister Dahal’s official visit a year ago. The issue was discussed during the meeting between Prime Minister Dahal and Indian External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar as well. They also expressed satisfaction over progress in the implementation of bilateral agreements mainly in energy trade, connectivity and investment. In recent years, we have seen progress in investment, economic and trade sectors. Yet we still have some differences on border issues. That is an important and positive development in Nepal-India relations in recent years. In the past, when we had some differences on political, border or other issues, that used to badly affect other aspects of our relations. But now, both the countries agree to resolve outstanding issues through dialogue and our trade and all other affairs are moving ahead smoothly. This is the encouraging part of our relations. But border disputes can sour our relations anytime, right? Is there a sense of urgency to resolve it once and for all?The prime minister is for activating the concerned bilateral mechanisms to resolve such issues. He has also invited Indian Prime Minister Modi to visit Nepal. We can expect the Indian prime minister’s Nepal visit in near future. We can make some progress in resolving some outstanding matters such as border issues during the high level visit. I believe we will move ahead in this direction.Any progress on submitting the report of the Eminent Persons’ Group?During the meetings, the prime minister raised overall bilateral issues that include the matter related to the EPG report. I think once the mechanisms are activated and start working, that will create a situation for the report’s submission.Nepal and Bangladesh are completing homework for greater energy trade. India’s facilitation is a must for that. Is there any progress on securing the southern neighbour’s support for that?Progress in energy cooperation is a major achievement of this tenure of the prime minister. The progress is not limited to the bilateral level but goes to the regional level. A Cabinet committee of the Bangladesh government earlier this month approved a proposal to import 40 megawatts of electricity from Nepal. At present, we will use India’s infrastructure to export energy to Bangladesh. But for the long term there is a plan to build a dedicated transmission line for that. This shows it is not only Nepal that is interested in exporting its energy but other countries in this region are also interested in importing Nepal’s electricity. We have also signed an agreement to build a cross border transmission line with China. The doors are being opened for regional trade of our energy. This development will make India more open to importing energy from Nepal.Why are we failing to expedite projects under the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) of China?The economic cooperation between Nepal and China has substantially increased after we joined the BRI framework. So, Nepal has been benefitting from the BRI. We see some concern about the lack of progress on certain infrastructure projects to be built under the BRI framework. In fact, we are in a better position to implement the projects because now we can decide what kind of BRI projects are good for us based on the experience of project development and implementation under the BRI in other countries.We are working to finalise the BRI implementation agreement. Nepal wants to move ahead by signing the implementation agreement and developing the projects. Nepal joined the BRI framework based on its need to diversify trade and connect to the world market. The reality is the same now. So, we need to sign the implementation plan and move ahead as soon as possible. When I attended the Boao Forum a few months ago, I found the Chinese authorities and other stakeholders holding debates to build quality and resilient infrastructure. They also have plans to support the capacity enhancement of human resources and transfer technology in the BRI member countries.People mainly link the BRI with big infrastructure projects such as railway, road and transmission connectivity but there is no significant progress on these fronts. What are the roadblocks?In Nepal, no big infrastructure project has been completed on time, be it the Melamchi drinking project, airports, hydropower or road projects. We haven’t developed the capacity to build big projects, and we don’t envision any plan to operate after building it. So, not only with China but also with other countries and agencies, we have to seek support for small and medium-size projects that we can efficiently build and operate. Also, the third version of the BRI action plan has included building not only big but small and smart projects under the framework. We have to push for that. As we build our capacity, we can gradually take up big projects. For instance, now we can build big hydro projects on our own. It wasn’t the case until some years ago. We developed expertise in hydropower by building many small projects in the past few decades and gradually enhanced our capacity. We have already faced problems in operating the Pokhara and Bhairahawa airports. Is there any progress in taking Chinese support to operate the airports?We have to see both aspects—domestic as well as international use—of the airports. The two airports have helped us upgrade the quality of our domestic air travel as the passengers have benefited due to the upgraded infrastructure. The number of domestic passengers in these airports has increased significantly.It is true that there is no progress in terms of operating them as international airports. The government is studying all possibilities of their use based on their unique features. We are exploring various options in international markets to attract adventure tourists to Pokhara. Chinese stakeholders are also holding some promotional activities in Pokhara. Chinese authorities have told us that they are consulting with their provincial bodies and exploring possibilities to run regular flights to Pokhara. Similarly, the government is mobilising our embassies and other stakeholders in certain countries having a large number of Buddhist tourists to operate flights to Bhairahawa, and we have received some positive responses. I believe we will be able to operate regular international flights from these two airports soon.It’s been eight years since we signed the trade and transit agreement with China, which was touted as a historic deal between the two countries. Why haven’t we been able to implement it?Some symbolic steps have been taken in this period. For instance, a shipment was received from a third country [Vietnam] using a Chinese port in September last year. Similar other initiatives have been taken but these are limited to symbolic gestures. We have to prepare infrastructure and some legal basis to implement the agreements in a more result-oriented way. A bilateral meeting is being held this week. The meeting is likely to discuss how to bring the trade and transit protocol in an effective way. This meeting will discuss various issues faced so far and will also pave the way forward. We have also proposed to form a ministerial-level mechanism to oversee overall bilateral issues. The upcoming meeting will sort out various issues.The Chinese side was conducting a feasibility study of the Keirung-Kathmandu cross-border railway project. What is the progress?There is progress in various projects that we are carrying out with Chinese support. The cross-border railway feasibility study is in the final stage. Likewise, the study on the Chhahare-Tokha tunnel project is ongoing. A Chinese team is arriving to conduct a feasibility study of the Hilsa-Simkot road. A process to award a contract to build a friendly bridge at Hilsa with Chinese grants has begun. A foundation stone will be laid there soon. Also, a study to build the Chilime-Rashuwagadhi-Keirung 220kV cross-border transmission line is beginning soon. \nThe government has decided to make the National ID Card mandatory in order to receive services from government and public institutions. In the first phase, the June 6 Cabinet meeting made the National ID card number mandatory in 28 districts. People including federal lawmakers criticised the decision saying that it was enforced without first distributing the cards. In this context, Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal sat down with Yubaraj Katel, director general of the Department of National ID and Civil Registration.Let’s begin with a basic question. Why do we need a National ID card while we already have citizenship certificate, driving license, passport and voting card?There is a fundamental difference between a citizenship card and National ID. Citizenship establishes whether you are a citizen of the country and it helps you identify yourself with some basic details. In Nepal, it was also widely used as a service card. Wherever you go, you have to show the citizenship card—to open a bank account or acquire a SIM card for a phone. If we study international practices, there are mainly two cards—one is an identity card and the other is a service card. In 2018, the Nepal government came up with the idea of distributing national identity cards with a unique digital number for each eligible citizen. The number can track not only the individual but also the person’s activities and movements. This project has various components. First is data collection. It has two categories—demographic data, such as the names of father, mother and other family members. Second is biometric data—fingerprints, eye retina and digital signature. The biometric data is crucial to create a unique identity of each individual and avoid duplication in the integrated national database. The National ID has these two types of data. The other tasks are enrollment of the data, printing and distribution of the cards and then providing services based on that. At present, people carry multiple cards in their pockets. The objective of this project is to replace all of them by a single card–National ID. The new card includes vital details of all other cards in its chip with 1GB storage capacity. The government wanted to trace people based on their unique individual numbers so that there is no need to print and carry multiple cards. There is a huge industry of printing separate cards for each and every service that is creating a jumble of information. The National ID will not only replace multiple cards but also help authorities control criminal activities like financial frauds by removing duplication. At present, government authorities have difficulty in tracing and identifying an individual and wrongdoers are benefitting from that situation.What cards will be replaced by the National ID?It has a chip with 1GB storage capacity where you can store your driving license, academic documents, voting card, insurance details, ATM card number, etc. For instance, if you go to a telecom company to acquire a SIM card, they will ask for a copy of your citizenship card. You can say, ‘no, I have a National ID card’. Once you give your number and fingerprint, they can immediately verify it through the system. Another objective is to help people get rid of filling up pages of forms for each service. International governance has a norm that says don’t ask citizens their information more than once. A state agency should seek the information once and provide it to other state agencies if they require it. People complain that many agencies don’t accept National ID. They still ask for a citizenship card for official record and verification. So, in practice, it didn’t help people reduce the number of cards in their pockets. In fact, it added one more.Therefore, the June 6 Cabinet decision made the use of National ID cards compulsory in 28 districts. Now, it is going to be essential to get social security allowances, pensions and claim health insurance. The Health Insurance Board has said it has become challenging for them to verify whether a claimant is the rightful one. The board has 8 million policyholders. We will give them our details. Then, they can cross-check the authenticity of a claimant. This will help avoid huge financial frauds. In fact, the government should have made it mandatory earlier.But people including lawmakers in the federal parliament have strongly opposed the decision saying that the government made National ID mandatory without first distributing the cards to the people.Nepal’s total population is over 30 million. Our principal stakeholders are citizenship card holders. Those 16-year-olds are eligible for citizenship cards. The Election Commission distributes voting cards to those above 18 years. We got the data from the commission and added 20 percent and estimated that we have 18.6 people above 16 years old. As of Friday, we have already distributed the National ID numbers to 14.9 million people. Now, as per our estimate, around 3.7 million people are yet to get the National ID. Millions of people are abroad. Thus, we are headed towards saturation point in terms of data collection and issuance of the numbers. One thing I want to stress is that people don’t need a hard copy of the National ID card. The number is sufficient. Printing cards is costly. We have to pay around 2 euro to procure a blank card. The cost of printing, delivery and other overhead expenses is added to that. With the task of printing over a billion copies of ID cards being too costly, even India discourages use of hard copy of the cards. You can create the QR code of your card, save it in your mobile or print it in a paper and scan it wherever you need it.Officials at our government agencies bring up the rule that makes it mandatory to present a physical copy of citizenship card or other documents for official works.Yes, we are trained and habituated in that way. Now we need to change. We must make offices paperless while developing a strong database system. We have been using citizenship cards to verify the identity of a person for a long time. Biometrics not only helps identify people but also trace their activities. Recently, Rs2 billion was found in the bank accounts of a 26-year-old man. The money was deposited in 56 bank accounts. He used 13 ATM cards and 17 phone numbers. Once the National ID card is implemented, transactions and movements of such wrongdoers will be easily traced and monitored. Identifying individuals accurately is crucial to ensure good governance and strengthen security. Many people have acquired fake citizenship cards. People even made fake passports. Implementation of National ID will control it. It is also related to our national image. It will help improve the status of our passport and add authenticity to our other documents as well.Once the National ID comes into wide use, our details will be traced and used by multiple agencies. State agencies and other institutions benefit from the integrated database as they can easily trace us. But how do you ensure our data isn’t misused and it doesn’t make us insecure?If you have a National ID card, you don’t need a hard copy of your driving licence. There is a backlog of around 2.1 million licences. The government has failed to print and distribute them. We told them, we have already procured 12 million cards. Of them, 3.2 million cards have already been printed and we still need to print around 8 million cards. Once the licence data is integrated with the National ID card, it will be shown there. Now, to come to your question, only the traffic authority can access the licence-related data. The device they use will trace only relevant data. Only an authorised agency will get access to the data and it can’t be used for anything other than the stated purpose. We give access to agencies like Nepal Rastra Bank, Nepal Telecommunication Authority and Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal. Then they regulate the things in their domain. No unauthorised body or individual can access it. Do the implementing agencies have infrastructure to use this technology?We are in a position to implement it in some parts of the country. Therefore, we are implementing it in phases. We are making it mandatory for certain services in 28 districts from mid-July. We should have started much earlier. It must be expedited.Lawmakers said in a Parliament meeting that the decision has ‘terrorised people’ in the 28 districts as locals feared they might be deprived of the services as the government has made National ID cards mandatory without first distributing them.We started the National ID registration process from 2018. Registration teams reached in each local ward except in Mugu and Humla districts of Karnali. It was carried out as a campaign. Even after the drive’s completion, the registration process was open in all the 77 districts, 54 area administration offices and in palika (local unit) centres. We also had registration centres in major downtowns. We receive data of around 4,000 registrations a day. So, there has been sufficient initiative and enough time to encourage people to get the number. Besides, if anyone in the 28 districts are still to get the ID number, they still have three months to register.You said only an ID number but no hard copy was needed to access any kind of service, right?Exactly. There is no provision that states one should produce a hard copy to get any service. You give the number and your biometrics to verify that you are the right person. Then, the official can crosscheck it in the database within seconds.Do all the implementing agencies have the devices that read the National ID cards?We have distributed 4,200 machines that read the cards in 333 local units of the 28 districts. Likewise, we have asked other local units and districts and some agencies such as banks to procure the devices and we have given the specifications based on their requirements. A device costs just around Rs 1,500. You can enter the number and place your thumbprint on it. We have trained relevant officials from all the local units for the purpose.How many cards can the department print at present?We can produce 1,500 cards an hour. But now we are producing only 1,800 a day. We have the strength to distribute 30,000 cards a day but are distributing only 5,000 a day.Again the same question. Then why are people not getting the cards?There is some communication gap. People who registered in 2018 or 2019 haven’t contacted us. We are giving them priority to clear the backlogs. But people who are newly-registered are showing more interest. So, we need to strike the right balance.When will the department be in a position to distribute the cards to all the people?At present, we can print 100,000 cards a month. We have a space to double the capacity. Meanwhile, people have now shown more interest. By enhancing our facilities’ capacity, we can print the pending 8 million cards in the next 40 months.What about election cards? Do we need to register for that and get the voting cards?In fact, the Election Commission doesn’t need to collect data and issue cards. We will talk to them. As a constitutional body, we have to readily make the data available for them. In fact, the National ID Card system can help the commission make voting arrangements for the Nepalis abroad because it can accurately identify the right person and can immediately update the integrated system here in Nepal about the votes cast in any country. This card will be helpful in conducting fair elections because the biometric data stored in this system will be perfect bases to identify the people and instantly update the activities in the database.You have emphasised replacement of other cards by the National ID cards. How long may it take to do so?We plan on giving priority to three sectors—banking, civil aviation and telecom. People right now need to fill separate forms for these services that have irked the service seekers. We have asked the bankers to buy the devices. We as a supplier are ready. Now the stakeholders should be ready too. It will benefit them because it helps control frauds.What if I don’t register for the National ID card?In the first place, you will be deprived of social security funds, pension, insurance policies. Likewise, the government will gradually make the card compulsory to receive many other services such as driving licence, land transaction, telephone numbers, bank accounts. How do you assure that our data stored in this system isn’t misused?See, the current practices make you more vulnerable. Because multiple agencies take your data for various purposes. Do they have a system to protect the data and ensure that it isn’t misused? But when your data is stored only by a dedicated government agency, it will be more secure as the agency is specialised for that. When other authorised agencies seek data, we give them access only to the relevant one. We have a National Identity Management Information System (NIMIS). We have maintained three layers of security—L1, L2, L3—to ensure foolproof security of the data. There are three servers.Are we dependent on any foreign company for any related service?So far, only one international vendor is involved but we are cutting down its involvement as well, with a plan to ultimately replace it by our own agency. The vendor now helps transfer collected data to the printing machine through the Automated Biometric Identification System (ABIS). But our plan is to do so through our own government agency or local vendor. We do all the other tasks. Security printing is done within the office basement where every movement of people is monitored and recorded. \nThe weather across the country is forecast to be generally cloudy on Wednesday.Light to moderate rain accompanied by thunder and lightning is expected in several parts of Koshi Province, Bagmati Province, Karnali Province and Gandaki Province, as well as at one or two places in the rest of the provinces.The meteorological forecasting division has warned of heavy rainfall in some parts of Gandaki, Bagmati and Karnali provinces.Tonight, the weather is expected to remain generally cloudy throughout the country, with light to moderate rainfall.Likewise, moderate rain with thunder and lightning is likely to occur at some places in Gandaki Province, Lumbini Province, Karnali Province and Sudur Pashchim Province, as well as at one or two places in the rest of the provinces.Heavy rainfall is expected at one or two places in Koshi, Lumbini, and Sudur Pashchim provinces.The maximum temperature on Tuesday was recorded at 36.7 degrees Celsius in Dhangadi, while Jomsom’s lowest recorded temperature was 16.0 degrees Celsius. \nThe weather across the country is forecast to be generally cloudy on Tuesday.Light to moderate rain accompanied by thunder and lightning is expected in several parts of Bagmati Province, Gandaki Province and Lumbini Province, as well as at one or two places in the rest of the provinces.The meteorological forecasting division has warned of heavy rainfall in some parts of Gandaki Province.Tonight, the weather is expected to remain generally cloudy throughout the country, with light to moderate rainfall.Likewise, moderate rain with thunder and lightning is likely to occur at some places in Bagmati Province Karnali Province, Sudur Pashchim Province, and Gandaki Province, as well as at one or two places in the rest of the provinces.Heavy rainfall is expected at one or two places in Koshi, Bagmati, Sudur Pashchim and Gandaki provinces.The maximum temperature on Monday was recorded at 36.4 degrees Celsius in Janakpur, while Jomsom’s lowest recorded temperature was 15.5 degrees Celsius. \nThe weather across the country is forecast to be partly to generally cloudy today.

Write it in the form of inspiring story not news article or event.\n    \n    Story:\nOnce upon a time, nestled between the towering peaks of the Himalayas and the lush jungles of the Terai, there was a country named Nepal. Though still a developing nation, Nepal was a land of profound beauty and deep-rooted cultural heritage. The residents of Nepal faced many challenges, but beneath these hardships lay a resilient spirit and an unyielding hope for the future.\n\nThis enchanting land, where Mount Everest reaches towards the skies and the air carries a mix of incense and cool mountain breezes, was more than a geographical marvel. It was a mosaic of cultures, languages, and traditions, a testament to human endeavor against all odds. Nepal's history, from the unification under King Prithvi Narayan Shah to its transformation into a federal democratic republic, told a story of aspiration and endurance.\n\nIn recent years, the people of Nepal, with their indomitable will, had taken strides towards rebuilding and reimagining their country. They turned their struggles into stepping stones, each challenge a chapter in their ongoing saga. The shift from a monarchy to a republic had not only changed governance but had woven a new tapestry of democratic values and collective decision-making.\n\nEconomically, while agriculture continued to sustain a large part of its population, Nepal had begun to harness the potential of its picturesque landscapes, developing sustainable tourism that promised to preserve their natural heritage while boosting local economies. Communities living in the shadows of the Himalayas had become stewards of the earth, protecting the biodiversity that made their country unique.\n\nEach day brought new stories. Whether it was a festival in Kathmandu, a technological advance in Pokhara, or a conservation effort in Chitwan, these events were threads in the vibrant quilt of Nepali life. These stories, updated daily, reflected the pulse of progress and the spirit of hope that characterized this resilient nation.\n\nAnd so, as Nepal moved forward, each moment was not just a passage of time but a promise of potential, a narrative of a nation perennially climbing towards tomorrow, guided by the legacy of its past and the dreams of its future.\n\nNews events:\nAt a time when the transitional justice commissions have been defunct for more than two years, Nepal Police has started inquiries about the victims of enforced disappearance, their family members say.On Monday, a police team from Lalitpur visited the houses of such victims in the Thecho area where they asked the families if the missing persons had returned or if they had established any contacts. The team also reached Nagma Mali’s house to inquire about the whereabouts of her father. Nandagopal Mali, who was arrested by the security forces, has been missing since June 22, 2004.“I was not home when the police arrived. Later they called to ask if I had any updates on my father,\" she told the Post. \"It came as a shock and I suspect the police have taken up the issue as the transitional justice commissions remain defunct. It is a worrying sign if true.\"Victims’ rights advocates say the police who went door to door on Monday claimed to have received a circular from the Police Headquarters to study the situation.\"The victims have reported that the police who visited their place said they were doing their job as directed by the central office,\" Suman Adhikari, founding chairperson of the Conflict Victims Common Platform, told the Post. \"What is the government trying to do by mobilising the security agency to look into war-era cases while keeping the transitional justice commissions defunct?”The Truth and Reconciliation Commission and the Commission for the Investigation of Enforced Disappeared Persons (CIEDP) have been paralysed since July 2022, after the government decided to extend their terms without retaining their chairmen and members. The CIEDP has the responsibility to investigate the cases of enforced disappearances. Against the government’s claim that the bill to amend the Enforced Disappearances Enquiry, Truth and Reconciliation Commission Act would be endorsed by October 2022 and open the door for recruiting new office bearers, there has been no progress even after two years. The government has already given four extensions to the two commissions in two years.Through its last Cabinet meeting, the Pushpa Kamal Dahal government on July 19 extended their terms by another year. However, it is still unsure when the Act gets amended and the defunct commissions get their office bearers. The government employees deployed to the commissions lack authority to conduct works other than day-to-day administration.The Dahal government on April 12 had formed a committee to recommend the office bearers for the two commissions. However, it is yet to hold its first meeting as the National Human Rights Commission has refused to send its representatives until there is commitment from the government and the political parties to endorse the amendment.“Rather than using intimidation tactics by mobilising the police, the government should work towards a proper revision in the Act and ensuring that the two commissions become functional,” said Adhikari.Nepal Police, however, denied having issued any such circular recently. “Finding the missing persons is our job, which we always do. However, there has been no circular to subordinate offices to carry out inquiries targeting the missing people from the conflict time,”Dan Bahadur Karki, the Nepal Police spokesperson, told the Post. “There are separate commissions to look into these matters.”The commissions were formed in February 2015 with a two-year deadline to investigate cases of atrocities committed during the war. But nine years since, their terms have been extended for around 10 times without any tangible results.The commission on disappearances got a total of 3,223 complaints. However, it has shortlisted only 2,506 cases for investigation after a study that the other complaints did not fall within its jurisdiction. \nNepal, India and Bangladesh have agreed to sign an agreement on July 28 on the export of Nepal’s 40MW of electricity to Bangladesh via India.Officials from the Nepal Electricity Authority (NEA), the Bangladesh Power Development Board (BPDB) and the NTPC Vidyut Vyapar Nigam Ltd (NVVN) of India will sign the agreement at a function in Kathmandu.Minister for Energy, Water Resources and Irrigation Dipak Khadka of Nepal; Power Minister Manohar Lal of India; and Power, Energy and Mineral Resources Minister Nasrul Hamid of Bangladesh are scheduled to witness the signing ceremony in Kathmandu, NEA Spokesperson Nabinraj Singh said.“After the signing ceremony in the Capital, joint secretary and secretary level meetings will be held on July 29 and 30, respectively, to expedite the process,” Singh said.The meetings of the joint-secretary level Nepal-Bangladesh Joint Working Group (JWG) and the secretary level Joint Steering Committee (JSC) will expedite the work as per the agreement.Nepal and Bangladesh will finalise the deal six years after they reached an understanding on energy cooperation. With this agreement, the NEA will export 40MW hydroelectricity to Bangladesh from June 15 to November 15 every year.As per the agreement, Nepal is estimated to sell 144,000 MWh (megawatt-hour) electricity in five months at the rate of 6.4 US cents a unit.Nepal will transmit the energy to India through the 400KV Dhalkebar-Muzaffarpur cross-border transmission line and before India transmits the equivalent to Bangladesh. The NEA will calculate the quantum of exported energy at the Mazaffarpur point. The NEA estimates an earning of around Rs330 million for the country through the sale. Nepal needs to use Indian transmission facilities to transmit the electricity as Nepal and Bangladesh aren’t directly linked to each other. Energy trade between the two countries became possible only after India was ready to facilitate the process.A month ago, a meeting of the ‘Cabinet Committee on Government Purchase’ of Bangladesh had approved a proposal to import 40 MW of electricity from Nepal. The proposal was put forth by the Power Division of the Bangladesh Power Development Board (BPDB). \nAsturni Dagoura turned 75 last May. She spent more than half of her life as a Kamaiya, indentured labourer, in her landlord’s property where her children were born, grew up, eventually following in her footsteps as Kamaiyas themselves. It wasn’t long before she was able to get the family together. She was married at the age of eight to Krishna Bahadur, who also worked as a Kamaiya in a landlord’s house at Badikhalla of Krishnapur Municipality. Asturni did not know how much money he had borrowed or how long he had been there, but she joined him after their marriage.The practice of such form of slavery (Kamaiya), which is unthinkable in the 21st century, was prevalent across the western Tarai districts of Dang, Banke, Bardiya, Kailali and Kanchanpur, predominantly among the Tharu community. Although the government had announced the liberation of Kamaiyas in the year 2000, the freed families languished in camps for years in lack of effective rehabilitation programmes. In the past there was fear of epidemics like malaria in the Tarai. Migration was the only way to escape epidemics. Managing land, cattle, and finding accommodation in a new place was challenging. Those who could not manage often worked as labourers in other people’s fields to eke out a living. During those times, those who earned a living by working in other people’s fields were traditionally known as Kamashu (Kamaiya) in the Tharu language.After the 1960s, many people from the hilly communities started migrating to the Tarai. After that, the landlords started exploiting the Tharu community. In the beginning, those who had a lot of land would allocate land and grain to the indentured workers. But as even landowners struggled due to dwindling land and income, inhumane treatment started as they could not even provide enough for food. According to a study done by Ram Bahadur Chhetri in 2008, Kamaiya practice has existed for around 200 years in Nepal. Before that, the tribal Tharus owned plenty of land. Over time, as their land dwindled, they started living as Kamaiyas. They were responsible for all household chores, from farming to cattle grazing, at the estates where they worked. Men ploughed, dug, fetched and chopped firewood, while women farmed, washed clothes, and tended to the cattle.Asturni worked from dawn to dusk. She would rise at 4 in the morning to clean the barn, feed the cattle, cut the grass and wash the clothes. After that, she would work on the farm. For all this work, the moneylender would give a certain amount of paddy and wheat, which would be insufficient. If they asked for more food, their loan would increase, making it almost impossible to escape. Now, Asturni’s daily life has changed. She doesn’t have to work from morning till evening and her family is together. All are engaged in their own profession. She no longer has to toil like a slave. On July 17, 2000, the Nepal Government announced the liberation of Kamaiyas. But after the announcement, there was confusion for some time. The freed workers were housed in camps and there was no work. Without employment, finding enough food became a problem. Gradually, the government began distributing land for rehabilitation.Then they began to feel that they were free. “After we got the land, we decided to live,” said Asturni, “then we gradually started working from farming.” When the freedom of Kamaiyas was announced, 2,462 family records were collected in Kanchanpur. Then in 2002, around 2,000 families were collected and the number of freed Kamaiyas’ families in this district reached about 4,500.Initially, they were kept in nine camps, and later rehabilitated by providing each family plots ranging from half kattha to five kattha (around 170 square metres to 1700 square metres of land) in different places of the district. The size of the allotted land depended on its value, proximity to markets, and location—rural or urban areas.However, most of the rehabilitated Kamaiya settlements are situated along riverbanks, so there is a risk of flooding.A year after their liberation, under the rehabilitation programme, Asturni’s family was allotted five kattha of land (1700 square metres) on the bank of Chaudhar River in Ashapur area of Bedkot Municipality in Kanchanpur district. After that, her sons, who were working in different places as Kamaiyas, reunited with the family at the same place. Asturni was very happy to have the entire family together. Vikram, her eldest son, lived as a Kamaiya in Daiji of Bedkot Municipality, while her middle child, Bal Bahadur was in Krishnapur municipality, and the youngest, Man Bahadur lived in Samadaiji in Bedkot. After their liberation, all of them received land in the same area.They had received land on the bank of the Chaudhar River, where flooding and erosion occurred during the rainy season. There was a settlement of people from the hill community nearby. Man Bahadur Dagoura recounted how people from the community threatened them claiming that the riverside land belonged to them.Now a lot has changed in Ashapur. The houses that were built during the rehabilitation of the freed Kamaiyas have all been replaced with concrete houses. Flooded fields have been turned into safe farmlands by constructing embankments. Some residents are engaged in vegetable farming, others as masons, while some have gone to India for employment. Everyone is engaged in some profession. Three people are employed overseas.Initially, a total of 16 families were rehabilitated in the area, but now the number of families has reached 36. There are 15 masons with 15-20 others working as their assistants.“Now we can do what we want. The income is also good,” said Man Bahadur, adding, “This has changed the lives of us all.” He has built a concrete house at the cost of over Rs2 million earned from vegetable farming, and sends his son to school. He grows seasonal and non-seasonal vegetables on his own five kattha and additional 10 kattha of rented land. He says that he earned a net profit of around Rs400,000-500,000 a year.Bal Bahadur Dagoura, who spent his 30 years as a Kamaiya, is now a construction worker. After the announcement of the Kamaiya liberation, various organisations provided skill training and Bal Bahadur learned masonry.Janaki Chaudhari of Ashapur vividly recalls her former landlord’s harsh treatment. She was forced to lift heavy loads, even while pregnant. “The pain and suffering we faced while working as Kamaiya is unspeakable,” said Janaki, who is now engaged in commercial vegetable farming. She says she earns up to Rs250,000 per season. \nThe Kathmandu Metropolitan City has resumed pavement widening in the New Road area from Wednesday. Officials at the Public Construction Department under the metropolis said that the contractor resumed the work after the High Court, Patan issued an interim order paving the way for following an interim order from the High Court, Patan allowing the work to proceed. “Now there is no obstruction from locals nor from federal government agencies,” said Baburam Bhattarai, a member of the City Planning Commission under the KMC. “We hope that the project will be completed at the earliest.”The metropolis had awarded a contract to widen the sidewalks by 1.5 metres along both sides of the road section between the New Road gate and the Juddha Statue roundabout in the last fiscal year. The work started in the New Road area in May, but a jurisdictional dispute between the city office and the Road Division, Kathmandu, caused the project to come to a halt. The division confiscated contractors' equipment, and the federal government deployed police in to prevent the city office from working. Some local residents, too, had demonstrated against the pavement widening plan. The division had even repaired the parts of roads cut for pavement expansion.And on June 9, the metropolis moved the High Court challenging the breach of jurisdiction by the road division, which is a federal agency, and its intervention in the city’s work.City officials were already frustrated by the years-long delay by federal agencies in completing another project, the widening of Kathmandu’s Ring Road in the Kalanki-Maharajgunj section, which has caused huge inconvenience to the public due to dust and mud.Mayor Balendra Shah then directed city officials to dump truckloads of dirt from the Ring Road section in front of the main entrance of the Road Division office at Minbhawan, accusing federal agencies of delaying the work.The 8.2km Kalanki-Maharajgunj section was set to be widened by the Chinese government, and the work was initially planned to start in early 2020, but the project has not progressed even after years due to Covid and delays in clearing the power poles and in some cases structures along the right of way.Regarding the jurisdiction dispute over the sidewalk widening work in the city, a division bench of judges Dhurba Raj Nand and Prakash Kharel at the High Court Patan issued an interim order in favour of the metropolis on Sunday.The City office has already widening pavements by 1 metre on both sides in the Bhrikutimandap area. “Neither did the federal government agency intervene, nor did locals object while expanding pavement in the Bhrikutimandap area by narrowing the road,” said Bhattarai. “Further decisions on pavement widening in other areas like Thamel, Handigaun and others will be taken after collecting public feedback.”Officials said that the long-term plan is to restrict motor vehicles altogether in the New Road area due to heavy pedestrian traffic. “We have also been working to find a solution to the parking problem and weighing various options including setting up multi-storey parking facilities,” said Bhattarai, who is also an urban planner.Officials said that pavements in the New Road area, which always remain crowded, should be widened to ensure free pedestrian movement. Officials claimed that New Road residents have also requested the city office to expand the pavement.According to city officials, local residents have, from time to time, complained about feeling unsafe and experiencing sexual harassment on the narrow and crowded sidewalks. \nBelahiya border point in southwest Nepal has been made a hassle-free crossing point, at least for Indian travellers.Following many complaints from unhappy travellers, especially Indians who visit Nepal in private vehicles, the district administration has started providing service through a one-window system.The district administration launched an integrated checkpoint, a new facility, last Wednesday. Indian tourists, who don’t require passports, and drive across the border are not subjected to lengthy customs waits to get a temporary vehicle pass.Under the new system, police and customs officials will jointly conduct security checks and issue a security clearance card.Tourism entrepreneurs hailed the government initiative, stating that such a fast-track system would send a positive message and help bring more tourists from India to Nepal. Earlier, Indian tourists who came via road had to undergo repeated checks, and their vehicles were searched multiple times. “All the checks are now completed at one place. After the clearance, the Indian vehicles will not require additional checks within Rupandehi district,” said Ganesh Aryal, chief district officer of Rupandehi. “But if the security personnel have suspicions, they can conduct a check at any time.”The vehicles which have been issued the ‘yellow card’ can go anywhere hassle-free, Aryal said.The system is basically for Indian tourists, who are not put through the immigration process or need to have their passports stamped like tourists from third countries do. Belahiya is a major entry point. It is the gateway to Lumbini, the birthplace of the Buddha, and receives nearly 80 percent of overland foreign tourists. The point also attracts many Indian visitors, as Chitwan and Pokhara are easily accessible from there. These destinations are becoming most popular for Indian tourists of late.Tourism entrepreneurs say that once the six-lane Narayanghat-Butwal road is completed, Nepal could receive millions of Indian visitors.The government has recently allowed Indian visitors to pay in Nepal through the quick response (QR) code system, reducing the hassle of carrying banknotes.The international airport in Bhairahawa is also waiting for commercial operation.Ek Narayan Aryal, secretary at the home ministry, inaugurated the integrated checkpoint on Wednesday amid a ceremony. He said that Rupandehi had started an excellent work.“We have taken tourism as a basis for the country’s prosperity. We are willing to welcome as many tourists as possible, but the environment also needs to be conducive,” said Aryal.Aryal underscored the need for such a system nationwide. “Expanding such facilities to all border points will create an easy environment for tourists.”“The ministry will do what is necessary to expand such a facility nationwide.” Indian tourist flow has increased in destinations like Pokhara, Chitwan, Kathmandu and Lumbini. Nepal and India share 1,800 km of border points.Khel Raj Pandey, mayor of Butwal Sub-metropolitan City, said creating a tourist-friendly environment was essential. “We complain about why tourists are not coming, but we don’t do anything to facilitate their visit.”“Tourists need to be provided with hassle-free services.”Istiyaq Ahmed Khan, mayor of Siddharthanagar municipality, said many tourists travelling to Nepal using private vehicles complain about the limitation on carrying currency.“We have demanded that the home secretary allow Indian tourists to carry at least Rs200,000.” Currently, Indians entering Nepal are not allowed to carry more than INR25,000. Lawmakers have also urged the government to remove restrictions on the amount of currency Indian tourists can use while visiting Nepal.Krishna Prasad Sharma, president of Lumbini Chambers of Commerce and Industry, said that the cash-carrying limitation by Indian tourists needs to be removed. “We want to bring as many tourists as possible to the country but also restrict them from spending here,” he said. “It’s a ridiculous policy.”India is Nepal's top tourism source market. In 2023, over 300,000 Indian tourists entered Nepal via air transport.However, the overland Indian visitors’ survey conducted in 2017 by the Nepal Tourism Board showed that 1.36 million Indian tourists travelled to Nepal through the surface route.The number may be even more significant now.Though the issue in Belahiya has been settled, tourism entrepreneurs said Indian tourists entering from the Jamunaha border point of Nepalgunj, Banke, also face similar hassles.After getting customs clearance, Indian vehicles need to visit another checkpoint to obtain a route permit. Since most Indian tourists come to Nepal in private cars, getting route permits can be problematic.Thakurdwara, a tourist centre in Bardiya, also has many Indian tourists.But complaints about that point are also galore. The checks on the highways are frequent and tiresome, even after they have completed all formalities at the customs point.Travel trade entrepreneurs say the security personnel's behaviour towards the Indian tourists is strange. \nPrime Minister KP Sharma Oli will go for a floor test on Sunday, barely a week after taking the oath of office.Oli, who was sworn into the top executive position by President Ramchandra Paudel on Monday, decided to go for the test earlier than expected “in order to execute his work plan more confidently,” said Mahesh Bartuala, chief whip of the Oli-led CPN-UML. He has also been assigned to coordinate among the ruling parties on parliamentary matters.Oli, as the parliamentary party leader of the UML, had appointed Bartuala as chief whip of the ruling party as per the party charter. The prime minister consulted ministers and party leaders before deciding to schedule the floor test.After taking the vote of confidence, Oli plans to address the nation the same day, highlighting the objectives and priorities of the new government.On the same day, a hearing on a writ petition challenging his appointment is due at the Supreme Court.Advocates Deepak Adhikari, Khagendra Prasad Chapagain and Shailendra Kumar Gupta filed the petition on Monday seeking a mandamus order to annul the appointment for being unconstitutional.The petitioners argue that the President must call for the formation of a new government under Article 76(3) after the one formed under Article 76(2) fails to secure a vote of confidence.The Office of the President, the federal parliament secretariat, Nepali Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba and Prime Minister Oli are among the defendants named in the petition.Govinda Prasad Ghimire, information officer at the Supreme Court, said a preliminary hearing on the petition has been scheduled for July 21.The prime minister will address the nation and take part in a question-answer session in the House, said Bartuala. In order to expedite his works, the prime minister is gaining the confidence of majority parliamentarians as soon as possible, he added.Oli was appointed prime minister as per Article 76(2) of the constitution, and the prime minister thus appointed must take the vote of confidence within 30 days. Article 76(2) states that in cases where no party has a clear majority in the House, the President shall appoint as prime minister “a member of the House who can command a majority with the support of two or more parties”. As per Article 76(3), the President appoints the parliamentary party leader of the largest party the prime minister. The leader then has to seek a vote of confidence within 30 days.Ahead of the vote, Oli, who aims for the support of more than two thirds of House members, is going to meet the leaders of several fringe parties, including Rajendra Lingden of the Rastriya Prajatantra Party, Upendra Yadav of the Janata Samajbadi Party, and CK Raut of the Janamat Party.Though both Yadav and Raut are positive about extending support to Oli, the RPP is still undecided, said a UML leader. Since the ruling Nepali Congress and UML, the two largest parties in the House of Representatives, have already extended support to the chief minister of Madhesh Province, a Janamat Party member, “we expect the party to vote for Oli on Sunday,” said the UML leader. Yadav’s position has yet to be known.Oli is certain to secure a majority in favour of his trust motion. On Sunday, he was appointed prime minister on the basis of the signatures collected from 166 lawmakers. The prime minister needs at least 138 votes in the 275-member House to retain his position. Oli, along with 21 Cabinet ministers, took the oath of office on Monday. This is Oli’s fourth stint as the country’s chief executive. First appointed the prime minister in October 2015 (until August 2016), Oli was head of the government from February 2018 to May 2021 and from May 2021 to July 2021.Meanwhile, Prime Minister Oli has started appointing his secretariat members. Rajesh Bajracharya is the chief personal assistant to the prime minister. He has been working closely with Oli for over a decade.After the vote of confidence, the prime minister is planning to appoint more advisers and members of his private secretariat. These include chief political adviser, foreign relations adviser and press adviser. Bishnu Rimal is said to return as the chief political adviser. Rimal also served Oli in the same capacity earlier.On Wednesday, on the recommendation of the prime minister, President Paudel appointed senior advocate Ramesh Badal as the new attorney general.Oli had entrusted Badal to negotiate with Congress leaders before the two parties signed a seven-point deal on July 1. Earlier, Badal served in the Oli government as attorney general from March 19, 2021 to July 13, 2021.According to the Office of the President, Badal was appointed to the position as per Article 157(2) of the constitution. The attorney general is the government’s chief legal adviser. Dinmani Pokharel, who was appointed attorney general by the Pushpa Kamal Dahal-led government in December 2022, had resigned on Tuesday. His resignation followed the customary tradition of the legal adviser quitting with the change in government. Pokharel had courted controversy for issuing a letter to then deputy prime minister and home minister Rabi Lamichhane, stating that no cases had been filed against him in the cooperatives fraud case. \nFormer US President Donald Trump has returned from the jaws of death, albeit with a chipped ear, after he suffered a gunshot at a rally in Pennsylvania. Coming on the heels of a poor performance in the first televised live debate by his opposition presidential candidate Joe Biden, the attack has helped the controversial Republican politician consolidate his vote bank. Luckily for him, he could raise his fist and chant “Fight, fight, fight” before being frisked away by Secret Service agents, bettering his chances of returning to the White House as undecided voters seem to buy his arguments about a plot against America. Violence against a candidate at the cusp of election only generates sympathy for them; having seen death up-close, Trump is now eyeing a resurrection of his political career.But no debate in the social media age follows the straight dichotomy of good versus evil or victim versus perpetrator. Taking cue from Trump’s own modus operandi of creating what he calls “alternative facts,” conspiracy theorists and some of his detractors have been calling the attack a plot by Trump himself to gain public sympathy. An old photo of him, with both his ears intact, has been doing the rounds on the internet, claiming that he was not injured at all. After all, this is the same man who was indicted for instigating an attack on Capitol Hill and trying to overturn the 2020 US presidential election results. From investigating crimes by him to now investigating a crime against him, US law enforcement and investigation agencies have an unexpected, rather strange, task in their hands.But amid the din of which of the old men returns to the White House as the 47th president of the United States of America or the motive of the 20-year-old Republican voter-turned-gunman or even the misgivings about Trump’s victimhood, an age-old question of gun culture has made a comeback. American gun culture has a central role in the assassination attempt on Trump, and Trump himself is one of the fiercest defenders of such a culture. And if anyone thinks Trump will now rethink his love for guns, one of his advisers, Chris LaCivita, has clarified that the ex-president will continue to protect gun rights. For the Republicans, the constitutional guarantee offered by the Second Amendment for individuals to carry guns is sacrosanct; Trump will potentially continue to exploit the Americans’ emotional attachment to the gun as a self-defense instrument.Such is the gun obsession in the United States, even after seeing the assassination of four presidents—Abraham Lincoln, James A. Garfield, William McKinley and John F. Kennedy—and assassination attempts on Gerald Ford, Ronald Reagan, Bill Clinton and George W Bush, among others, the country is helpless to do much about it. The comfort of amnesia is too dear to America when it comes to dealing with the tough question of gun violence. And with a morally repugnant record of supplying arms to Israel in its attempts to wipe out the Palestinians, Trump’s opponent and sitting president Joe Biden is lost for words. The United States should really unite to wipe out gun culture. \nThe second Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation (BIMSTEC) Foreign Ministers’ retreat was held in Delhi on July 11-12. This was when the BIMSTEC initiative slowed down, with each country having other priorities. Many saw BIMSTEC as an alternative to SAARC, as the regional organisation was revived as a cooperation vehicle in the Eastern part of South Asia. It now has a Secretary General with a Secretariat based in Dhaka and adopted a charter only recently, even though the organisation came into existence in 1997. Yet efforts are being made for regular meetings and dialogues among the officials of states to take the initiative forward and make progress on the 14 priority areas.Pushing the agenda forwardSince 2023, the BIMSTEC Foreign Ministers’ retreat has become a regular event. Founded in 1997, the organisation held its fifth summit in Colombo in March 2022, where the charter was adopted after more than 20 years. This reflects the lack of commitment of member countries to take the process forward. While India sees BIMSTEC as a vehicle for its Act East policy to engage with South East Asia and as a gateway for the South Asian region, Myanmar and Thailand’s expectations are limited as they are already a part of ASEAN. Bangladesh, which has projected itself as the hub of connectivity and has a Look East policy, is also the lead country for connectivity projects and has been an active member of the group. For Nepal and Bhutan, BIMSTEC acts as a forum to improve their foreign policy interests and provide these countries with access to the sea through multiple countries within a regional framework. The BIMSTEC region brings together 167 billion people, incorporating 22 percent of the world population and a combined GDP of $3.71 trillion. India and BIMSTECWhile the organisation moves slowly, ironing out differences between member states to establish seamless trade and connectivity, India has prioritised BIMSTEC in its foreign policy—from BIMSTEC outreach in the BRICS meeting that India hosted at Goa to inviting the BIMSTEC leaders to attend the swearing-in of Prime Minister Modi’s government in 2019. India hosted the first meeting of the BIMSTEC Energy Centre governing board in Bengaluru in 2023 to suggest a road map for meaningful intra-BIMSTEC cooperation, among other issues. India is the lead country in BIMSTEC, collaborating in transport and communication. For India, BIMSTEC promises to connect its North-East terrain to the growing regional markets in South-East Asia. It promises connectivity and access to the port in the North-East region. While regional connectivity within the BIMSTEC framework is taking time to fructify, India is already working within the sub-regional and bilateral frameworks. For example, its effort to establish connectivity with Bangladesh would go a long way as a building block for BIMSTEC connectivity. It is similarly engaged with both Nepal and Bhutan to build road, rail, waterways and grid connectivity.It is speaking of the land bridge with Sri Lanka and underwater cables, as well as the restart of ferry services with Myanmar. It is engaged in the Kaladan multimodal project and has access to Sittwe Port, inaugurated in May 2023 and has been operationalised. The trilateral highway promises to link India to Thailand through Myanmar. After the Arakan Army captured the Paletwa township near the Mizoram border, the road project of nearly 110 km connecting Peletwa to Zorinpui at Mizoram will be in cold store for some time. The Arakan Army has said they would want the project to continue and harness mutual benefit; India is closely watching the situation. It has completed 70 percent of the trilateral highway, but the security situation in the Sagaing Region of Myanmar has not allowed the completion of the project. Once built, this project will help the BIMSTEC member states.Transport, connectivity and tradeEnabling the environment to conduct trade remains a priority. The Framework Agreement on the BIMSTEC Free Trade Area (FTA) was signed on February 8, 2004, but has yet to conclude an FTA. There have been discussions to remove tariff and non-tariff barriers, rule of origin, standardise trade and progressively move towards including the service sector. A BIMSTEC Trade Negotiating Committee (TNC) has been formed. The BIMSTEC Trade Facilitation Strategic Framework 2030 points out, “India and Thailand have the most advanced facilitation environment in the region, followed by Bangladesh, Myanmar, and Sri Lanka”, emphasising a structured pathway to enhance regional trade.Transport and electricity grid connectivity among the members of the Bangladesh-Bhutan-India-Nepal subregion would constitute a significant building bloc, leading to the advancement of some of the BIMSTEC agenda. In 2022, the member states adopted BIMSTEC's Master Plan for Transport Connectivity and are planning to establish a ‘Coastal Shipping ecosystem, of port facilities, of ferry services in the Bay of Bengal, as also power grid interconnectivity and a regional motor vehicles agreement’. According to BIMSTEC energy outlook 2035, between 2014 and 2019, the energy supply in the region has grown at an average rate of 10.72 percent.BIMSTEC was once touted as an alternative to SAARC, even though the geographical spread of member countries is different. The Bay of Bengal, part of the Indian Ocean, remains a primary focus area of the BIMSTEC countries. The potential for sea-borne trade with the cheapest transportation cost remains attractive, given the instability in Myanmar. The first meeting of the working group on coastal shipping discussed the agreement in November 2017. A consensus on the agreement has yet to arrive. Coastal shipping agreements already exist between India and Bangladesh. India is already using Sittwe port in Myanmar under a bilateral arrangement. Vishakhapatnam port is now open to Nepal for its external trade. An MoU was signed between the Port Authority of Thailand to use Ranong Port in Western Thailand and the Port Trusts of Visakhapatnam, Kolkata and Chennai in 2019 during the BIMSTEC Conclave of Ports.Security CooperationExternal powers are showing increasing interest in the Bay of Bengal region. China is already building a port in Myanmar to access the Bay of Bengal through Myanmar. There is an increasing interest of the US in this region as a part of its Indo-Pacific strategy.Combating international terrorism, transnational crime and drug trafficking remains a major concern in this region because of the Golden Triangle. The situation in Myanmar has also added to this concern.The Tri-Services HADR PANEX series of exercises among the BIMSTEC countries also enhances individual countries’ capacity to deal with natural calamities and other challenges at home. National security adviser-level meetings also facilitate dialogue between the member countries on the security challenges that the region faces. These meetings also complement the Colombo Security Conclave, which discusses security issues among the Indian Ocean littorals. Intra-regional tourism can be increased through visa liberalisation, which will also contribute to people-to-people contact.The second Foreign Ministers’ retreat in Delhi is essential to take the process forward. However, given the slow progress, BIMSTEC has yet to make its mark. There are several bilateral disputes between the member countries, but those have never posed a challenge to cooperation, as seen in the SAARC context. The pace of the summit meeting has acquired gravitas. Thailand is going to host the sixth summit in September. Given the region’s economic and trade potential, it is expected that the leaders of member countries rise to the occasion to make the cooperation in Eastern South Asia a grand success. \nWhen the Indonesian monsoon arrived in November 2023, Nahale, 52, began planting corn in her field. A woman farmer with a disability, she relied on rainwater as a primary water source. The rain abruptly ceased, however, causing the plants to wither and perish. Nahale lost all her seeds and suffered significant economic losses. Unaware that climate change was the culprit behind these unpredictable weather patterns, she continued with her usual planting schedule. But unlike previous seasons, the rain came at different intervals, leading to devastating crop failure. People with disabilities, specifically women and older people, are often disproportionately affected by the impacts of climate change. There are around 1.3 billion people in the world with disabilities. Approximately 23.3 million are in Indonesia. Climate change is already having a severe impact on Indonesia’s economy. Agriculture, fisheries, water supply and healthcare are all affected.In 2024, the estimated financial loss so far was around 115.53 trillion Rupiah (upward of $US7 billion), with more significant losses expected. Climate change has caused prolonged droughts and reduced water availability in many parts of Indonesia, particularly Eastern Indonesia. In East Nusa Tenggara, the water availability is as low as 1,098.08 m3/capita/year, affecting more than 5 million people in the province.Water insecurityClimate change drives water and food insecurity, particularly affecting vulnerable communities. Crucially, women face extreme difficulties in accessing water for household needs, agriculture and livestock. Droughts exacerbate the challenge as it becomes increasingly difficult for women to find sufficient water sources to fulfil these essential requirements. These conditions have profoundly affected the agricultural sector with multiple crop failures due to shifting weather patterns and water scarcity. El Nino worsened conditions, further challenging East Nusa Tenggara’s vulnerable agricultural sector. This puts farmers into financial stress. Disabled farmers, like Nahale, are especially vulnerable, along with women generally and the elderly.Their incomes have seen a considerable decline, leading to increased debts and interest payments to banks or cooperatives. As the family head, with the responsibility of providing for their families’ needs, Nahale and other women with disabilities or elderly women who face similar situations have limited time to take care of their own well-being, leading to health insecurities.Nona, Nabaga and NabungaTake the case of Nona, a 47-year-old woman with a disability and a member of a minority tribe. After the death of her husband, who was the primary breadwinner, she was left with three children to support. She then became a motorbike taxi rider to drop passengers from her village to the cities. However, Nona’s job was affected by climate change because of the rapid shift in weather patterns, she could not go out to deliver her service to her customers because of sudden rain during the day. This puts her family in economic hardship because of income loss.To survive, she had to develop her cooking skills and sought assistance from a cooperative to access credit for starting a small catering business. However, this puts her in a debt situation. Nona's journey reflects how individuals like her must adapt and find alternative ways to make a living amid the effects of climate change.The strategy of increasing women's economic empowerment through diversification of livelihood becomes important to counter the adverse effects of climate change.Nabaga, a 76-year-old female farmer with physical disability, also has experienced crop failure and turned to IKAT weaving to make ends meet. However, Nabaga faces challenges in marketing her IKAT weaving products and needs support in accessing broader markets to ensure viable sales.Extreme weather events caused by climate change hamper the ability of the disabled, older people and women, to access healthcare. Nabunga, 70, from Kupang, with a mental disability, is unable to receive crucial health services. Her name is not listed in the government-based data as a person with disability who is eligible to receive social aid and health services, which puts her at heightened risk and increases her vulnerability during disasters caused by climate change. She finds solace and assistance from the supportive community around her and church. Hers is not an isolated case.Government intervention is vital to provide these vulnerable women with essential social protection and welfare support. The Indonesian government ratified the Paris Agreement—a legally binding international treaty that serves as a guideline for nations to address and reduce climate change impacts—in 2016 to significantly show its commitment to adapt, mitigate and develop its climate goals as part of global climate actions.However, climate change-related planning, policy-making and actions have not adequately considered the overlaps between climate change, disabilities, age, gender and social inclusion. The detrimental impact on most vulnerable community members is the lack of necessary support to cope effectively with climate change's effects. The government could consider the connections between climate change, disabilities, gender, age and social inclusion in its planning processes to achieve meaningful participation and ensure the protection of society's most vulnerable members.Women such as Nahale, Nona, Nabaga and Nabunga are vulnerable because they face related challenges brought on by climate change. The government could empower these women and millions like them by providing essential social protection and welfare support.Considering multiple, overlapping factors can help avoid exacerbating their multiple vulnerabilities due to climate change. These considerations will pave the way for a more comprehensive and inclusive approach to climate change adaptation and mitigation efforts. This approach will achieve three objectives: Enhance the marginalised community's resilience, foster a more equitable and sustainable response to climate change and achieve the sustainable development goals.Ultimately, the approach will enable policies and actions to address different vulnerable communities' specific needs and challenges in Eastern Indonesia. -360info \nAfter the formation of the federal Cabinet on Monday, Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli has been criticised for not being inclusive while constituting the team of the country’s highest executive. In his 22-member Council of Ministers, Oli picked only two women while he didn’t choose a single Dalit member. There are a few things for which even those from developed countries praise Nepal and in which we Nepalis can take great pride. The inclusive constitution of Nepal promulgated in 2015 and the laws formulated in line with the charter are quite progressive. Dalits, women and other oppressed communities fought long for their representation. But it was after the success of the people’s movement in 2006 that the enforcement of inclusive policy in state agencies started to be strengthened. And the constitution formally institutionalised the achievements of the political and other movements.Unfortunately, the spirit is gradually dying. It’s not only Oli who has ignored the call for inclusivity in his Cabinet. The same trend had been in evidence in the past. The immediate past prime minister and CPN (Maoist Centre) chair Pushpa Kamal Dahal, who often boasts of introducing an inclusive system in the country, didn’t appoint a single minister from the Dalit community in his last Cabinet. This is a serious concern. Having a progressive constitution and laws doesn’t mean much if the leaders in the driving seats of the executive agencies trample on its spirit. If there is a community that is most discriminated against, it is the Dalits and they therefore deserve priority for representation under an inclusive system. Worryingly, leaders not only disregard the constitutional spirit but don’t follow even minimum criteria while picking ministers, lawmakers or other officials for important posts. Aspirants for ministerial berths rather often resort to various shenanigans to impress top leaders, promoting unhealthy practices in politics. We urge the prime minister to try to correct this egregious mistake in the days ahead.The new prime minister has also stood out for something positive though. He was quick to form a full-fledged Cabinet. In the past, prime ministers would initially appoint a few ministers and take weeks, if not months, to give the Cabinet a full shape. The factional feuds within the prime minister’s party for ministerial berths and bickering between coalition partners over power sharing would frustrate the public. The heads of the government would oversee a dozen ministries, hampering the government’s functioning. Prime Minister Oli’s appointment of all his team members on the day of swearing-in means the government can function in a full-fledged way from day one. Also, in his first Cabinet meeting on Monday, Oli gave ministers specific deadlines to accomplish given tasks. Unlike in the previous Cabinets, Oli has also chosen more experienced ministers in his team.Prime Minister Oli and Nepali Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba are among the senior-most leaders who have been in power on and off since the restoration of democracy in 1990. Deuba was home minister in the first post-1990 government and Oli succeeded Deuba in 1994. They know how things work at Singhadurbar. The Congress and UML leaders have given various rationales for the coming together of the two largest parties in the federal parliament. If they can make a mark in governance and service delivery, they would have gone a long way towards fulfilling their promises.  \nThe weather across the country is forecast to be partly to generally cloudy on Thursday.Light to moderate rain accompanied by thunder and lightning is expected in several parts of Koshi Province, Bagmati Province, Karnali Province and Gandaki Province, as well as at one or two places in the rest of the provinces.The meteorological forecasting division has warned of heavy rainfall in some parts of Koshi, Bagmati and Sudur Paschim provinces.Tonight, the weather is expected to remain generally cloudy throughout the country.Likewise, moderate rain with thunder and lightning is likely to occur at some places in Koshi Province, Bagmati Province, Gandaki Province, Karnali Province and Sudur Pashchim Province, as well as at one or two places in the rest of the provinces.Heavy rainfall is expected at one or two places in Koshi, Madhesh, Gandaki and Sudur Pashchim provinces.The maximum temperature on Tuesday was recorded at 36.3 degrees Celsius in Dhangadi, while Jomsom’s lowest recorded temperature was 15.5 degrees Celsius. \nSunaina Rana is a classical Hatha Yoga teacher and a spiritual seeker. She completed her Isha Hatha Yoga teacher training in 2015 and has since dedicated her time to providing yoga classes in India and Nepal. She also volunteers at the Isha Yoga Center in Tamil Nadu, India, founded by Sadhguru. As part of Sadhguru’s foundation, Rana resonates with their mission to raise human consciousness and establish spiritual infrastructure globally, fostering spiritual growth and well-being for all. Rana is currently in Nepal and will provide Hatha yoga classes in Kupondole Heights, Sanepa, from the end of July until the end of September. In this conversation with the Post’s Sanskriti Pokharel, Rana discusses the role of books in her spiritual journey, factors that drew her towards yoga and takeaways from volunteering at the Isha yoga centre. Which books have had the most impact on your practice of yoga?As a Hatha yoga teacher and spiritual seeker, the most profound impact of yoga comes from consistent daily practice.Books have also been instrumental in offering inspiration and motivation. Some of the books which have helped me are ‘Mystic Musings’ by Sadhguru, ‘Life and Death’ by Jiddu Krishnamurti, ‘Awareness’ by Osho and ‘Jonathan Livingston Seagull’ by Richard Bach. Does yoga help in day-to-day life and emotional well-being? Yoga has played a tremendous role in my day-to-day life. It has helped me manage stress and anxiety. For example, if a situation upsets and angers me, my perspective completely shifts after a yoga session. As a result, I feel much more settled and balanced.What pulled you towards yoga and spirituality? Since childhood, I have been connected to prayer, chanting the Hanuman Chalisa before bed as my nightly ritual. However, in my late teenage years, I began to feel disconnected from these prayers. I wanted to understand more and uncover the science behind such chants.Nine years ago, when I aspired to go to the US to pursue my master’s, my body felt sluggish and stagnant due to a lack of physical exercise. I wanted to change that as I did not feel good in my body.The health benefits of yoga attracted me to it. Additionally, I came across marketing videos of the five-month Hatha yoga teacher training on social media, and the trainees' experiences with the teacher captivated me. I decided to start a new spiritual journey by enrolling in the Hatha yoga teacher training certified by Isha Hatha School of Yoga.After completing the transformative five-month journey, I participated in several advanced three-day programs and a more intensive seven-day Samyama silence program with Sadhguru.During the Samyama silence program, I experienced profound spiritual dimensions that touched me and revealed that life could be experienced beyond the body and mind. This realisation led me to pursue the path of a full-time spiritual seeker and dedicate my life to Sadhguru’s mission of spreading meditation and yoga worldwide.How do you counter the stream of thoughts during your sadhana practice? When I began my sadhana nine years ago, my mind was flooded with incessant thoughts, like an explosion. Today, while I still have thoughts during sadhana, they have significantly diminished, and the experience of bliss and meditation is much stronger.Because of my consistent practice, my thoughts have reduced and are less disturbing. I’ve noticed that the more persistent and dedicated I am to my sadhana, the better I manage the stream of thoughts. How has reading contributed to your development as a spiritual seeker?Whenever I lack motivation and inspiration, I turn to books. For a seeker like me, reading offers diverse perspectives and reminds me of the importance of being aware, conscious, and balanced.In moments when my emotions are out of control and when negativity threatens to consume me, I turn to transformative books like ‘Inner Engineering’ and ‘Mystic Musings’ by Sadhguru. These books give me wisdom and knowledge, guiding me to clarity and stability.What is one major takeaway from your volunteering experience at the main office of Isha Foundation in Coimbatore, Tamil Nadu?It's been nearly a decade since I volunteered at the Isha Foundation. I find it an incredibly unique way of approaching life—a special and noble path to self-transformation.Witnessing thousands of individuals enter deep states of meditation is profoundly touching. Being part of this journey, where I gradually become free from my compulsions and see others striving for the same, has been a significant takeaway for me.Living in the ashram teaches us to transcend our likes and dislikes. By minimising the focus on our individual preferences, we learn to respond to situations based on their requirements rather than our desires.This approach is crucial because it shifts our focus from ourselves to the demands of the present moment. It's not an easy path to follow, but with conscious practice, we gradually become less bound by our identity and gain the flexibility to adapt to any situation.I haven't fully mastered this yet, but this lesson holds immense significance in my spiritual journey and remains one of the most valuable lessons I learned at the Isha Foundation.Sunaina Rana’s book recommendationsDeath: An Inside StoryAuthor: Sadhguru Publisher: Penguin AnandaYear: 2020This book eased my fear of death, both my own and that of loved ones, breaking its taboo for me.

It’s a valuable resource for historians and anyone interested in Nepal’s history. \nNepal national women’s cricket team begin their much anticipated ACC Women’s T20 Asia Cup in Dambulla, Sri Lanka on Friday.They will be heavy underdogs as their group contains ACC Women’s Premier Cup champions the United Arab Emirates, two-time Asia Cup runners-up Pakistan and defending champions and tournament’s most successful side India.Nepal’s first aim will be to achieve a first ever win at the Asia Cup.Nepal are making their third appearance in the biennial tournament, after previously participating in 2012 in China and in 2016 in Thailand. But they have yet to win a single match in the competition. In both editions, they finished the group stage winless and at the bottom of the table.However, Nepal could change that bitter history when they face the UAE in the tournament opener.“Our first target is to defeat the UAE,” Nepal skipper Indu Barma said. But the task will be a difficult one.The UAE are making their second appearance at the Asia Cup. But under captain Esha Oza, they have emerged as the strongest side among the associated nations.The UAE qualified for the Asia Cup as the winners of the ACC Premier Cup in February. Nepal initially failed to make the Asia Cup but was later included in the main event as one of the two semi-finalists—the other being Thailand—following the expansion of the tournament to eight teams by the Asian Cricket Council.Two years ago, the UAE and Nepal crossed paths in the ACC T20 Women’s Championship semi-finals. The UAE progressed to the final ahead of Nepal due to a superior net run rate in the group stage after their match yielded no result due to rain. The UAE went on to defeat Malaysia in the final to make their Asia Cup debut.In the 2023 ICC Women's T20 World Cup Asia Qualifier as well, the match between Nepal and the UAE was abandoned due to rain. However, the UAE finished the group on top and ahead of Nepal due to net run rate. Both the UAE and Nepal progressed to the knockouts as the top two teams. Nepal fell to Thailand in the semis but UAE won the tournament and progressed to the global qualifier (2024 ICC Women's T20 World Cup Qualifier).The UAE also had a blistering run in the T20 World Cup qualifier but ultimately failed in their mission to make their T20 World Cup debut after they were undone by Sri Lanka in the semi-finals.Nepal may have received a boost in their confidence when they defeated Sri Lanka Development Squad in the final and third T20 practice match to avoid series sweep, but their recent form suggests that UAE will still be heavily favoured.According to Barma, if Nepal defeat the UAE, their next goal will be trying to pull off an upset against the big teams and reach the semi-finals.But things are not as easy as it seems.Nepal next play Pakistan, who were runners-up in both editions Nepal participated, next Sunday and cricket’s powerhouse India on July 23.In the 2016 edition, when all six participating teams were in a single group, Pakistan had bundled Nepal for 47 runs before winning the match by nine wickets.Nepal were also humiliated by India in their next group match when the Indians wrapped up Nepal for just 21 runs to win by 99 runs. Nepal were chasing 121.India have won seven out of eight editions of the Asia Cup since its inauguration in 2004. Bangladesh won 2018 edition defeating India by three wickets.Rubina Chhetri, who is now Nepal’s most capped women’s cricketer with 55 appearances in the national team, and Sita Rana Magar were both in Nepal’s squad in 2016.But Rana Magar hopes Nepal women’s team will be a lot better this time as they have also drawn inspiration from the men's team who recently participated in the T20 World Cup.“Our plan is not just to participate in the tournament. We have a feeling that our team can play a good game against big teams like our men’s team,” said Rana Magar.“We have gained clarity on how to bat for a full 20 overs and how to bowl the ball through mentoring. There are positive changes in the team.”Former captain Chhetri is in fine form. The batting allrounder has scored 741 runs from 46 innings for Nepal and will bring inspiration to Asia Cup from her outstanding Premier Cup when she scored an unbeaten 118 against the Maldives in their record total of 227-4 to become Nepal’s first player to score a century in women’s T20Is. Chhetri is also the first Nepali player to score a century in women’s T20Is.Chhetri, who scored 17 (17), 28 (43) and 37 (26) in three warm-up matches against Sri Lanka, will form the core of Nepal’s batting unit alongside Barma and Rana Magar.Pacer Kabita Joshi also impressed with the ball in the warm-up, while Sabnam Rai and Kritika Marasini will lead the spin threat for Nepal. \nUS President Joe Biden, under pressure from fellow Democrats to drop his re-election campaign, tested positive for Covid-19 while visiting Las Vegas on Wednesday and is self-isolating after experiencing mild symptoms, the White House said.White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre announced the positive test for the 81-year-old Democrat after Biden cancelled a speech due to the diagnosis.“He is vaccinated and boosted and experiencing mild symptoms,” Jean-Pierre said.As he boarded Air Force One to depart Las Vegas to recuperate in Delaware, Biden told reporters: “Good, I feel good.” But he climbed the stairs slowly, holding the railing tightly and pausing a few steps in and again towards the top.The illness comes at a crucial time for Biden, who has been losing ground in battleground states against Republican Donald Trump, who is headlining a triumphant convention this week after he survived an assassination attempt on Saturday. The White House said Biden planned to spend a long weekend at his Delaware beach house. It was unclear how long the sickness would keep him for the campaign trail.Minutes after the announcement, the president’s motorcade was on the move to the Las Vegas airport after taping a radio interview in the city.Biden had greeted a couple of dozen people at a Mexican restaurant prior to going into the radio interview. He was running late to deliver a speech to Latino civil rights group UnidosUS when the organizer, Janet Murguia, announced he had tested positive for Covid.There were groans in the conference room at the news.“He said to tell my folks that we’re not going to get rid of him that quickly, we’re going to have a chance to hear from him in the future directly,” Murguia said.Biden, who had spent two nights in Vegas on the campaign trail, is locked in a battle with some fellow Democrats who worry he is too old to seek re-election and want him to step aside in favor of another candidate.He has been defiant in the face of the calls to quit the race, telling one interviewer that only the “Lord Almighty” could persuade him to go.“He will be returning to Delaware where he will self-isolate and will continue to carry out all of his duties fully during that time,” said Jean-Pierre.Biden suffered a blow earlier on Wednesday when a prominent Democratic member of the US House of Representatives, Adam Schiff of California, said it was time for him to “pass the torch” to someone else.Some 40% of Democratic registered voters said Biden should drop his reelection bid, in a Reuters/Ipsos poll concluded on Tuesday. Some 65% of independent registered voters agreed with them.Some 58% of Democratic registered voters told the poll they believed Biden is too old to work in government - 70% of independent registered voters agreed.The White House cited Biden’s doctor as saying he had been suffering from upper respiratory symptoms earlier in the afternoon.“He felt OK for his first event of the day, but given that he was not feeling better, point of care testing for Covid-19 was conducted and the results were positive for the Covid-19 virus,” the statement said.The White House said Biden will be self-isolating in accordance with Centres for Disease Control guidelines.His symptoms are mild and he has received an initial dose of Paxlovid, the doctor said.Biden’s last bout with Covid began in July 2022. He tested positive on July 21, recovered on July 27, tested positive with a rebound case on July 30 and was finally cleared on August 7. \nGermany will halve military aid to Ukraine in 2025 despite ongoing conflict and concerns over Republican candidate Trump's potential return, relying on Group of Seven loans and depleted military stocks.\nPresident Paudel appointed Ramesh Badal as the new Attorney General on Wednesday, replacing Dinmani Pokharel who resigned after the formation of a new government.\nThe Nepali Embassy in Dhaka has issued an advisory for Nepali students studying in Bangladesh regarding their safety in light of the recent protests across the country.Earlier today, the Bangladeshi government announced indefinite shutdowns of all public and private universities after student protests against a quota system for government jobs turned deadly this week, leaving at least six people dead and scores injured.The embassy urged students to stay indoors and obey the instructions of their respective university and college administrations.“The students are also requested to contact the embassy in case the administrators ask them to move to safer places or if the situation at their current accommodation is unsafe,” the notice reads.The embassy also said that they are closely monitoring the situation and are in constant contact with concerned government agencies and college administrative bodies for the safety of Nepali students.Contacts to reach the embassyYojana Bamjan, second secretary at the Nepali Embassy in Dhaka: +8801880691013Riya Chhetri: +8801745407958 \nNepal's imports from China surged 34.8% in the past fiscal year, driven by electric vehicles, while imports from India declined 3.1% due to export curbs, resulting in an 1.8% drop in Nepal's total imports despite a rise in informal cross-border trade with India.\nThe National Human Rights Commission advocates for expanding the Enforced Disappearances Enquiry, Truth and Reconciliation Commission Act to encompass war crimes, crimes against humanity, and child soldier issues, while ensuring justice for victims and reduced sentencing for cooperating perpetrators.\nIn the 1980s, Mohan Bikram Singh's split from Nirmal Lama led to a decade-long Maoist conflict under Pushpa Kamal Dahal, who became Prime Minister in 2022 but now faces an impending downfall due to waning popularity and electoral system reforms.\nThe International Monetary Fund (IMF) has warned that Nepal’s economy, still reeling from subdued domestic demand and post‑pandemic balance sheet repairs, may face an increasingly gloomy and uncertain outlook, mainly due to fragile political stability and cooperatives failure.The global lender, which provides policy advice and financing to its members to foster growth and financial stability, said Nepal’s fragile political stability could disrupt policy continuity and reform implementation. Nepal is set to elect the new prime minister next week. Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal is almost certain to fail the trust vote. This will be his fifth trust vote in a year and a half. The CPN-UML withdrew its support to the government on July 3 after it ditched its coalition with the CPN (Maoist Centre) and joined hands with the Nepali Congress to form a new government.This is the fourth time in Nepal’s political history that two major parties are forming a government without a powerful opposition, which observers say weakens democracy's effective functioning.On Tuesday, the IMF completed the fourth review under its four‑year extended credit facility, allowing Nepal to withdraw $41.3 million to help the country's economic recovery.This brings total disbursements under the extended credit facility for budget support to $247.7 million.The IMF executive board approved the extended credit facility arrangement for Nepal on January 12, 2022. The approved amount totals $371.6 million, which is 180 percent of Nepal’s special drawing rights quota (SDR) of 282.42 million.“Nepal’s economy continues to face challenges,” said the statement issued by the IMF on Thursday. It said that Nepal’s growth projected at 3 percent in the fiscal year 2023-24 remains below potential due to subdued domestic demand and post‑pandemic balance sheet repairs. The IMF has talked about Nepal’s cooperatives sector for the first time.In the statement, the IMF warned about the intensification of financial sector vulnerabilities, such as a further rise in non-performing loans. In this context, “more failures of cooperative lenders could endanger the banking system's soundness,” the IMF said.According to experts and bankers interviewed by the Post, cooperatives, which the government once embraced as one of the three pillars of the economy, are now threatening the economy.In Nepal, millions of small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are heavily involved in cooperatives, and their failure could not only damage the fragile economy, but also harm social harmony, say experts. Cooperatives are involved in sectors ranging from dairy and livestock to tailoring and retail.Recently, thousands of victims of cooperatives fraud have staged protests in various parts of the country, demanding the return of deposits embezzled by cooperative operators. Hundreds of such depositors came to Kathmandu and staged protests. The government recently signed an agreement with them, promising to solve their problems as soon as possible.“The problem in the cooperative sector will shake up the banking sector. But if there is a wise move, the banking sector can absorb the shock,” said Upendra Poudyal, president of the Confederation of Banks and Financial Institutions Nepal. He said that the regulation of cooperatives has already been delayed. “We have seen that cooperatives are being operated for personal gains. A limited number of people took the benefit.” “Now, the central bank should begin with a single threshold. Limit the number and start supervision.” As of mid-March, there are 31,450 cooperatives in Nepal, with 7.38 million members. The deposit mobilisation in cooperatives amounted to Rs478 billion, while credit mobilisation stood at Rs405 billion. They currently employ 94,000 people.In a recent interview, Kashi Raj Dahal, immediate past chairman of the Crisis-ridden Cooperatives Management Committee, a government agency, told the Post that globally, most cooperatives work in productive sectors like food production, dairy, fruits and other agricultural activities. “But in Nepal, around 25,000 cooperatives are involved only in financial activities, mainly collecting deposits and issuing loans. Such cooperatives are now in crisis. Over 15,000 are registered to collect deposits. Even others registered as multi-purpose cooperatives primarily engage in savings and credits. Around 500 cooperatives are currently in trouble.”The Dahal-led government has promised the return of at least Rs500,000 to each depositor by recovering it from the directors' assets. Yet doubts persist about whether depositors will get back their money. Some economists have warned about potential mass protests if the cooperatives issue is not taken seriously.The IMF has also warned that the failure to raise the execution rate of large-scale projects would deprive the economy of much-needed stimulus and weigh on growth. On the pessimistic side, the IMF said that economic activity is expected to increase, reaching 4.9 percent in 2024-25, supported by more robust domestic demand. The statement reads that the cautiously accommodative monetary policy stance, the planned increase in capital expenditures in the 2024-25 budget, additional hydropower generation, and a continued rise in tourist arrivals are expected to boost domestic demand and growth. Inflation is expected to remain within the Nepal Rastra Bank’s (NRB) target ceiling of 5.5 percent.“Nepal has made important strides on its economic reform agenda. Decisive actions in monetary policy, bank regulation and rolling off Covid support policies played a major role in overcoming urgent balance of payments pressure in 2021-22,” said Bo Li, deputy managing director of IMF. “Reserves continue to rise without the need to use distortive import restrictions. Despite revenue shortfalls, fiscal discipline was maintained in 2022-23 and 2023-24. Bank supervision and regulation have improved by rolling out new supervisory information systems. Nepal’s medium-term outlook remains favourable as strategic investments in infrastructure, especially in the energy sector, are expected to support potential growth.”The IMF said that strengthening public investment management would support the needed boost to capital spending. Enhancing fiscal transparency will help contain fiscal risks and strengthen medium-term fiscal sustainability.“As monetary policy transmission is still weak in a context of balance sheet repair, a cautious and data-dependent monetary policy remains appropriate to preserve price and external stability,” the IMF said.  \nHe is known for his nationalist legacy, marked by the amendment of Nepal's map to include territories like Kalapani, Lipulekh, and Limpiyadhura, and his strong stance against India, especially during and after the 2015 Nepal blockade.But how did he rise to become the country's powerful man? \nPyakuryal holds a Phd in Public Affairs from the University of Akron, US. In this interview, they discuss Nepal’s elusive political stability, the narratives governing Nepali politics, the role of patriarchy, and the trends in Nepali politics Pyakuryal will be closely following in the years ahead. \n\n\nPushpa Kamal Dahal, the chairman of CPN (Maoist Centre) and the immediate past prime minister, was accused of causing a split in the Janata Samajbadi Party Nepal (JSP-Nepal), one of his coalition partners.JSP-Nepal was not only a coalition partner in the Dahal government but also one of the founding members of the Socialist Front Nepal, which was established on July 8, 2023, amid a special function in Kathmandu.Dahal’s Maoist Centre, the CPN (Unified Socialist), led by Madhav Kumar Nepal, JSP-Nepal of Upendra Yadav and Nepal Communist Party of Netra Bikram Chand ‘Biplab’ had come together to form the Front.As leaders held a meeting of the Front at the office of Unified Socialist on Tuesday, Yadav remained conspicuously absent. Meanwhile, Mahindra Raya Yadav of Nepal Sanghiya Samajbadi Party attended the meeting as the new entrant of the Front.The JSP-Nepal chief boycotted the meeting as he held a serious grudge against Dahal. Former prime minister Dahal is not only accused of masterminding the split of JSP-Nepal but is also blamed for weakening the Socialist Front while in power.Soon after the party split, JSP-Nepal chair Upendra Yadav questioned the Front's relevance. Janata Samajbadi Party, formed by a splinter faction of JSP-Nepal, however, has not joined the Front. The new outfit, which is led by Ashok Rai, has seven lawmakers in the federal parliament while the mother party led by Yadav has five.CPN (Unified Socialist) leader and National Assembly lawmaker Beduram Bhusal, however, claims there is no ground to accuse Dahal. “It is true that despite being a member of the Front, member parties have taken arbitrary decisions favourable to their party,” Bhusal told the Post. “But this does not mean that Dahal had tried to foil the Front.”Agni Sapkota, the Maoist Centre leader who attended the Front’s meeting on Tuesday, told the Post that the members, who had met after a hiatus, took stock of the changed political scenario.“At the meeting, we concluded that the Congress-UML alliance can undermine the achievements in the name of constitution amendment, though their agreement is yet to be made public,” Sapkota told the Post. “We have decided to critically analyse every move of the newly formed government.”Tuesday's meeting of the Front also constituted a four-member task force to review the Front’s journey and suggest a way forward. The task force consists of Khadga Bishwakarma from Chand’ party, Ganga Narayan Shrestha from Nepal Samajbadi Party, Pramesh Hamal from Unified Socialist and Dev Gurung from Maoist Centre. They have been given a 15-day timeframe to submit their report.Meanwhile, detractors question the Front’s relevance. Manish Kumar Suman, a JSP-Nepal leader, said that the relevance of the Socialist Front ended after Dahal publicly accepted playing a role to split the JSP-Nepal. “Dahal is trying to activate the Front out of desperation after being ousted from power,” Suman said.Soon after the JSP-Nepal split on May 5, Dahal, while speaking at a function of his party, had said he would do anything to remain in power, indicating his role in the party split. The JSP-Nepal was split on the pretext that some lawmakers from JSP-Nepal and Unified Socialist were approaching the then main opposition Nepali Congress to form a government while both the fringe parties were in the Dahal government.But Bhusal said that the JSP-Nepal leaders might have provided such harsh assessment of the Front as they were in pain of party division, which is natural.Socialist Front was formed with a spirit to strengthen collaboration between the left-leaning political parties. But Dahal used it for his political gain, Suman accused. “Only after being ousted from the government did Dahal try to activate the Socialist Front,” he said.Dahal was ousted from the government after he failed to win the parliament’s trust after his coalition’s largest partner, the CPN-UML, reached a deal with Nepali Congress on July 1 to form the new government.The Front was formed after years of discussion among some left-leaning political parties. However, Baburam Bhattarai, a longtime advocate of the socialist front, was later left out. Instead of Bhattarai, the Netra Bikram Chand ‘Biplav'-led Communist Party of Nepal was inducted into the bloc.When formed last year, the Socialist Front had 54 members in Parliament. The Maoist Centre was the largest among them, with 32 seats, followed by JSP-Nepal, with 12 seats at the time, and Unified Socialist’s 10 seats. But now the Front only has 43 members, including Mahindra Raya Yadav, the chair of Nepal Sanghiya Samajbadi Party. Bhusal, the Unified Socialist vice-chair, argued that the number of lawmakers does not affect the Front’s functioning. “The Front was established to strengthen collaboration between the like-minded left-leaning parties so it has nothing to do with the Parliamentary affairs,” Bhusal said.The primary concept paper of the alliance says that the Socialist Front was established with “a basic commitment to federalism, democracy, republicanism, inclusion, and secularism—the five basic key features of the Constitution of Nepal.” Though the Front vowed to release the detailed concept later, it has yet to do so.The primary concept paper released during the inauguration on July 8 last year also states ‘amending the constitution’ as one of its objectives. However, the Maoist Centre, the leading force of the Socialist Front, is criticising the Congress-UML coalition government for including the constitutional amendment as one of its objectives.But Maoist Centre leaders claimed the constitution amendment mentioned in their concept paper is different from what the Congress-UML alliance is trying to do.“It is true that the primary concept paper released by Front last year also mentions the constitution amendment, but it is with the forward looking approach, but the objective of the Congress-UML alliance is different,” Sapkota argued. “We suspect they want to abolish the Proportional Representation system from the electoral system apart from other achievements, which would be a regressive move. We won’t let it happen.”Krishna Pokharel, a professor of political science, echoed Sapkota. “The Socialist Front was advocating for enriching the constitution and making it more progressive by amending it, but the objective of the Congress-UML alliance is different,” Pokharel said.Dahal harped on the idea of forming the Socialist Front after the dissolution of the Nepal Communist Party, considered to be the most powerful communist force in Nepal’s history, in early 2021.During a meeting held on March 22, the Front's member parties decided to try to get the CPN-UML, the largest communist party, on board the Socialist Front. They floated the idea as Dahal at the time ditched the Congress and brought the UML on board the ruling coalition.Now with the UML ditching the Maoist Centre and forming the government with Congress, the chances of their participation in the Front has ended for now. But then, the UML, the country’s largest communist party, was never so positive about the idea of forming Socialist Front. \nPrime Minister KP Oli has instructed his ministers to set deadlines for their work and bring about visible changes within a month.Addressing the first Cabinet meeting on Monday after taking oath of office and secrecy from President Ramchandra Paudel, Oli urged his cabinet colleagues to work with urgency.Along with Oli, other 21 cabinet ministers also took oath of office and secrecy on Monday at a function at the President Office.“The prime minister clearly instructed us to achieve visible change and show concrete results within one month,” said Prithvi Subba Gurung, Minister for Communication and Information.The Cabinet meeting also appointed Minister Gurung as government spokesperson. But the government has decided to make public the Cabinet decisions only after 24 hours.Besides urging his Cabinet colleagues to demonstrate results within a month, the prime minister stressed the need for the government to instill hope within six months that the government is doing a good job. The prime minister also called for visible improvements across all indicators within one year, while urging ministers to enhance coordination.Gurung announced the government’s new policy of not releasing Cabinet decisions immediately. Earlier, decisions were made public soon after each Cabinet meeting.Successive governments have adopted different approaches about releasing Cabinet decisions.“Cabinet decisions will be kept confidential for 24 hours. Since we have set the rule, neither the prime minister, nor ministers can disclose them before that. Why should we immediately publicise what we are doing? It is your responsibility to learn about it after 24 hours. If we release information prematurely, that will go against our policy of confidentiality,” said Gurung after the Cabinet meeting.“If anything requires to be made public immediately, it will be announced after the Cabinet’s decision,” said Gurung.The meeting also decided to upgrade the Kirtipur-based cricket ground to a stadium, Prime Minister Oli announced on his Facebook account, adding that the construction would be completed within 300 days.The new stadium in Kirtipur will feature state-of-art amenities such as parapets for spectators, floodlights for night games, among other things and will be completed within the 300 days, Oli wrote on Facebook. Despite cricket’s growing popularity in Nepal, inadequate infrastructure has affected both players’ confidence and spectators’ enjoyment of the game. Similarly, the Cabinet also decided to compensate family members if a member goes missing and remains unlocated for ten days, with an equal amount provided for a deceased person.Minister Gurung clarified that this compensation applies mainly to people missing in landslides, floods and other natural calamities where bodies are not found within ten days. And the compensation for those injured in such disasters will be different.“This is a new decision,” said Gurung. “But in the previous guidelines, those who go missing in natural calamities were not compensated.” The meeting also entrusted Liladevi Gadtaula as acting chief secretary until a new chief secretary is appointed. This is for the first time that the government has appointed a woman as acting chief secretary. \nNewly appointed foreign minister Arzu Rana has said that boundary disputes should be resolved through facts and evidence, avoiding unnecessary conflicts with neighbouring countries.While taking charge of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Monday, Rana, the country’s fourth foreign minister, said unlike in the past, it is no longer necessary to take decisions on boundary issues solely based on the inspection of border pillars.“We will resolve the boundary dispute with India based on geography, history and new scientific maps prepared on the basis of the global positioning system [GPS]. We have more information, facts and evidence now than in the past, so there is no need to bicker over which boundary pillar was where,” Rana told reporters after assuming the office of foreign minister. “The facts are there, so we can resolve all our border issues,” she said. “As per my briefing, the Mahakali serves as a border river, and both countries [Nepal and India] have access to it, so there is always a dispute.” “This is a transboundary issue, which we must clearly understand. Hopefully, something will happen in our lifetime. Resolution to the problem will be found on the basis of geography, history and GPS. There’s no magic solution. As I said, we are in a delicate geopolitical location so must act very carefully. We have survived as a nation for a long time, and need to continue to do so, not just for today or tomorrow, but for thousands of years,” said Rana. Prior to Rana, three women, namely Bimala Rai Poudyal, Sujata Koirala, and Sahana Pradhan, had taken charge of the foreign ministry.Rana, the spouse of Nepali Congress chief and former prime minister Sher Bahadur Deuba, has worn several hats in the past, including experience in social fields and parliamentary affairs. Nepal has a longstanding boundary dispute with India, and ongoing issues with China. Due to the lack of joint inspection since 2006, officials do not have records of such disputes on the northern border.“Regarding Kalapani, Limpiyadhura and Lipulek, we can sit with India and reach a resolution,” said the foreign minister, who will face daunting foreign policy challenges in the rapidly changing geopolitical landscape. On the first day of her office, the minister was asked how she would address boundary issues with India. She said geopolitics is a complex issue, and she does not rely on magic to resolve such disputes.She described her new role as “historic” and said she would use the opportunity in a constructive way.Rana stressed the importance of preserving Nepal’s legacy of never being colonised. “Ours is a small, landlocked country situated between two giants, so we have to maintain balanced relations with all,” she added. “Our ancestors have protected our country throughout history. The legacy must be upheld for generations to come.” Rana also stated that she plans to focus on executing economic diplomacy and implementing international treaties, agreements and commitments. Also, she committed to secure the repatriation of Nepali youths serving in the Russian Army, and to initiating efforts for the safe release of Bipin Joshi, who is believed to be in Hamas captivity since October 7 last year. \nCPN-UML chair KP Sharma Oli was sworn in as the prime minister of Nepal for the fourth time amid a function at the President’s Office in Sheetal Niwas on Monday. President Ramchandra Paudel administered the oath of office and secrecy to Prime Minister Oli. President Paudel on Sunday had appointed Oli as the prime minister under Article 76 (2) of the constitution as there were no other claimants for the post. After CPN (Maoist Centre) chair Pushpa Kamal Dahal, the immediate past prime minister, was unable to secure the trust of the House of Representatives during a floor test on Friday, President Paudel had invited political parties to form a new government under Article 76 (2) of the constitution on the same evening, setting a Sunday deadline for submitting claims at the President’s Office.With no other contender, Oli had in his support submitted the signatures of 166 lawmakers (Nepali Congress’ 88 and UML’s 78). The minimum number needed to form a government is 138 in the 275-strong House of Representatives.Soon after the swearing-in ceremony on Monday, Prime Minister Oli formed a full 22-member Cabinet, including two deputy prime ministers. Among the 22 members including the prime minister, 10 are from the Congress, while nine represent the UML. The other parties in the Cabinet are the Janata Samajabadi Party (JSP), led by Ashok Rai, and Loktantrik Samajbadi Party (LSP), which have two and one ministries, respectively. Shortly after Oli’s swearing-in, President Paudel also administered the oath of office and secrecy to the newly appointed ministers. Based on Article 76 (9) of the constitution, President Paudel, on the recommendation of the prime minister, administered the oath of office and secrecy to the ministers.Article 76 (9) stipulates that the President shall, on the recommendation of the prime minister, constitute the Council of Ministers comprising a maximum of 25 ministers, including the prime minister, in accordance with the inclusive principle from among the members of federal Parliament.Despite the Article based on which the prime minister recommended the ministers clearly stating that the council of ministers should be in line with the inclusive principle, that is not the case.In the 25-member council of ministers, Prime Minister Oli can still appoint three ministers.“The prime minister still can appoint three full Cabinet ministers or ministers of state to fulfil the requirement enshrined by the constitution for the council of ministers,” Purnaman Shakya, a professor of constitutional law, told the Post. “But ministers of state can only participate in Cabinet meetings in the absence of their line ministers.”In Monday’s Cabinet, Prakash Man Singh of the Congress and Bishnu Prasad Paudel of the UML were inducted as deputy prime ministers. They will also head the Ministry of Urban Development and the Ministry of Finance, respectively.In the 22-member Cabinet formed under Oli’s leadership, there are only two women. There is no representation from the Dalit and Muslim communities.In the 22-member Cabinet, 13 are from the Khas Arya community, and there are three members from Janajati and five from Madheshi communities.Nepal has incorporated proportional representation and inclusion as integral parts of the constitution. This was done to prevent the overrepresentation of one community at the policy-making level. But the country has failed to abide by its charter.“What an irony! Not a single Dalit get a berth in the new Cabinet formed by the so-called champions of inclusive democracy,” Lokraj Baral, a professor of political science, wrote on social media.Likewise, Bhimarjun Acharya, a constitutional expert, also questioned the new Cabinet's inclusiveness.“Everyone did a lot of politics in the name of Dalits, and the communists even more so. Dalits were not given any place in yesterday’s government led by Pushpa Kamal Dahal nor in today’s government led by Oli,” Acharya wrote on social media. “I request that Dalits be represented in the Council of Ministers immediately.” When the Post questioned Dalit members of the Congress and the UML parties, they said they were not the right people to comment on the issue.As per the National Population and Housing Census 2021, 13.2 percent of the national population are Dalits while Muslims comprise 4.86 percent of the population.Yet Dalit activists find fault with this silent approach. It is precisely because the Dalit politicians do not strongly raise the issue of their inclusion that this trend prevails, they say.“There are a few other reasons why Dalits are sidelined from mainstream politics. One is because of a weakened Dalit movement,” Purna Darnal, a Dalit activist, told the Post. “When the Maoist Centre, a political party that championed inclusiveness in Nepali politics, refused to be inclusive in the Cabinet formed in their leadership, why would other parties do so?”Darnal added that it is a matter of shame that the two biggest parties in the country practice such blatant exclusion while choosing ministers.Nine of the 10 ministers from the Congress are male. When dividing them into clusters, seven are Khas Arya, and one each are Janajati, Tharu and Madheshi.Likewise, eight of the nine ministers of UML are male. Six are from the Khas Arya community, two are Janajati, and one is a Madheshi. \nAs CPN-UML chairperson KP Sharma Oli becomes the country’s prime minister for the fourth time, he also carries a chequered history from his previous terms as the country’s chief executive.When he first took the seat at Singha Durbar in October 2015, wresting it from Sushil Koirala, violent protests were rife in the Tarai/Madhesh region in the wake of the promulgation of the Constitution of Nepal. The situation had been more difficult due to India’s blockade. A few months into Oli’s tenure, the southern neighbour withdrew its blockade while the constitution was amended to address the concerns of the agitating communities. Though the Madhesh-based parties boycotted voting on the constitution amendment, it had partially addressed the concerns of the dissenting groups. His government also signed a historic Trade and Transit Agreement with China, ending Nepal’s sole dependence on India for third-country trade.Oli’s nationalist graph as prime minister for 10 months between October 2015 to August 2016 went up so high that his CPN-UML not only emerged the largest party from the 2017 election but was very close to the majority mark on its own. When Oli moved into Baluwatar for the second time in February 2018, he had an even stronger electoral mandate. After a merger with the CPN (Maoist Centre) two months later, the Nepal Communist Party that he jointly led with Pushpa Kamal Dahal enjoyed a near two-thirds majority in the House of Representatives. Oli’s prime ministership started with high hopes and excitement as he was leading a majority government for the first time in around two decades. As Oli was set to lead the government for a full five-year term, the hope was that decades of political instability would end, the constitution would be implemented and the federal system strengthened. The expectations, however, were short-lived. Oli started demonstrating his authoritarian streak right after taking charge as the executive head. He brought the National Intelligence Department, the Department of Revenue Investigation and the Department of Money Laundering under the purview of the Prime Minister’s Office.His intolerance for dissent became apparent when he banned protests at Maitighar, near Singha Durbar, the government’s seat. His government then prepared a slew of bills aiming to muzzle the media, curtail freedom of expression and shrink civic space. He had contested the elections by selling big dreams—railway connecting China, Nepal’s own ship in the high seas, and distribution of gas through pipelines, among other things. But none of these dreams even came close to fruition. Having realised he had failed to deliver as promised even two years after coming to power, he played another nationalist card—amending the constitution to show Kalapani, Lipulekh and Limpiyadhura in Nepal’s map—which his predecessors never dared to do. While it has been registered as a historic move in the country, it antagonised New Delhi.Oli’s unilateral style of running government and leading the party forced Pushpa Kamal Dahal and Madhav Kumar Nepal to ally against him, leading to a split in the Nepal Communist Party. After failing to keep the NCP united, Oli tried to dissolve the House—twice in under six months.His decision to trample on the constitution to stay in led to his humiliating exit from the government. He was ousted by the Supreme Court. Political analysts say Oli has a historic opportunity to right the previous wrongs. “The Congress-UML alliance has generated high hopes and provides an opportunity for Oli to correct his past mistakes,” Uddhab Pyakurel, who teaches political sociology at Kathmandu University, told the Post. “However, Oli’s recent statements [on House dissolution] show he is still not in the mood for course correction. He has no regrets about his wrongdoings.”Oli has repeatedly defended his move to dissolve the House even until last month. The Congress-UML alliance stands on the foundation for stability. But how can the person who couldn’t give stability even when he commanded a majority government ensure stable government now, says Pyakurel. “Trust in the new government will be low as the parties have kept secret even the agreement that led to its formation,” he says.However, some analysts say it would not be easy for the incumbent not to deliver. “There is a strong voice within both the Congress and the UML that it is futile to form a government that cannot deliver. So the pressure to perform will come from both the ruling alliance as well as the opposition,” says Sanjeev Humagain, who teaches PhD students in politics and international relations at Tribhuvan University.“The Congress-UML coalition has the political capital needed to deliver. The bureaucracy too will find it difficult not to cooperate with the government of two major forces. I see a positive environment for delivery.” \nIn a bid to prevent garbage from piling up on streets during the monsoon, the Kathmandu Metropolitan City has deployed heavy equipment including bulldozers, excavators, and loaders, to clear the road to the landfill site. Officials said the move aims to ensure smooth transfer of waste as roads to the landfill often become impassable during the monsoon, preventing the passage of garbage trucks.“We have deployed three excavators, two bulldozers and two loaders to clear landslide debris along the road to the Bancharedanda landfill,” said Rabinman Shrestha, chief of the Environment Department at the metropolis. “Also, we have kept five more vehicles on standby for immediate deployment if needed.”Every year, during monsoon season, the road to landfill sites gets obstructed in multiple places, obstructing the transfer of house waste collected in the three districts of the capital city—Kathmandu, Lalitpur, and Bhaktapur. Apart from these, some local levels of Kavrepalanchok also discard garbage at the landfill site at Bancharedanda.The metropolis officials said that they had purchased 10 high-pressure pumps to drain floodwaters from inundated settlements.“Five pumps have already been sent to the high-risk areas along riversides,” said Shrestha. “These can quickly pump away floodwaters.”The city office started repairing the Sisdole road leading to the Bancharedanda landfill in Nuwakot district just a few weeks before the start of the monsoon. Officials said Rs30 million had been allocated for repairs, which included fixing potholes, concreting roads, and other works.Around 200 metres of road near the Sisdole area, which is often damaged by garbage trucks and excavators, will be concretised, according to officials.Besides monsoon-induced road obstructions, garbage disposal is sometimes disrupted due to obstructions by the residents living in settlements near and around the landfill site. These obstructions cause weeks-long halt to door-to-door garbage collection, leading people in the Valley to discard their trash on streets.Officials said that a high-pressure pump is being used to prevent the overflow of leachate from the dumping ground.Landfill leachate is a hazardous liquid containing harmful bacteria, chemicals and other components. It forms when rainwater passes through a landfill or when organic matter decomposes naturally.Officials say the leachate needs to be re-injected into the landfill, which quickens the decomposition process of the landfill waste and prevents the liquid from flowing into the river. The City office has also started segregating degradable and bio-non-degradable waste materials from households in its seven wards. Wards 5, 7, 10, 12, 24 and 27 have been segregating the waste materials generated in the households. The city office has also arranged separate trucks for collecting segregated waste materials from the households.Degradable waste materials are being turned into compost at the KMC’s waste transfer station. Officials said that the metropolis has also been using reagents to expedite the compost-making process.The city office recently sold non-degradable waste worth Rs700,000.Waste segregation at the source was one of the measures Mayor Balendra Shah touted as a solution to Kathmandu’s chronic garbage problem. After he assumed office, Shah asked city residents to start segregating waste at the source. They started doing so, using separate bins in their homes. But the plan didn’t work, largely due to a lack of preparations on the KMC’s part.The Kathmandu Valley generates over 1,200 tonnes of solid waste every day, nearly 60 percent of which comes from the KMC alone. Experts say 60 percent of organic waste originating in the Valley can be converted into compost and the remaining 30 percent of non-degradable waste can be recycled. \nIn a bid to lessen the spread of the dengue virus during the ongoing monsoon season, the Kathmandu Metropolitan City has decided to continue the drive to destroy mosquito larvae and breeding grounds. Officials at the health department of the city office said on Friday that they have just completed a week-long drive in all 32 wards of the metropolis and plan to continue these efforts in the coming days as well.“Every Wednesday, our health volunteers will visit households and open spaces to destroy mosquito breeding grounds,” said Rishi Bhusal, epidemic prevention and control focal person at the metropolis. “Decisions on preventive measures including launching search and destroy drives will depend on the spread of virus and intensity of rainfall in the coming days.”Dengue is a viral disease transmitted by female Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes. The same vectors also transmit chikungunya, yellow fever, and Zika virus, according to the World Health Organisation.According to data provided by the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division, at least 1,268 people from 72 districts have been infected with the dengue virus since January this year. Among the 72 districts that reported dengue outbreaks, Kathmandu has the highest number of cases: 141. Public health experts say reported cases could be just the tip of the iceberg, as around 80 percent of those infected are asymptomatic. Many people infected with dengue show mild symptoms and can be treated with paracetamol at home.Dengue symptoms include mild to high fever, severe muscle pain, rashes, severe headache, and pain in the eyes. Patients with these symptoms are advised to seek immediate treatment. While there is no specific cure for the disease, early detection and proper medical care can prevent death.Nepal reported its first dengue case in a foreigner in 2004 in the Chitwan district. Since then, an increasing number of dengue infections have been reported from many districts, including major dengue outbreaks. Last year, at least 20 persons died, and more than 52,000 were infected by the virus, which had spread to all 77 districts.In 2022, a total of 88 people died, and over 54,000 were infected by the virus across the country. During that period, hospitals in the Kathmandu Valley were overwhelmed with dengue patients, and pharmacies ran out of paracetamol, the most widely used medicine to treat fever.In 2019, the disease killed at least six people and more than 16,000 were hospitalised across the country. The virus had spread to 68 districts at the time.Though the post-monsoon period is considered the dengue epidemic season, the deadly disease has already become endemic in Nepal, as outbreaks of the virus are reported every month, including in the winter months.Officials at the health department said that 654 health workers, including female community health volunteers, were deployed in the week-long campaign, which concluded on Friday.“Volunteers and health workers who were deployed to the door-to-door campaign checked the mosquito breeding grounds and the larvae, made people aware about the risks and destroyed the breeding grounds,” said Bhusal. Health workers reported that storage places for scrap materials, discarded cups, and plastic in open spaces, and unused lands as potential hotspots for the dengue virus in the coming days. Health workers have warned owners of these sites that action will be taken if mosquito larvae are found against the owner of the storage place if mosquito larvae were found.Dengue-transmitting mosquitoes breed in clean water and bite people in daylight. Uncovered water tanks and discarded objects, such as plastic cups and bottles, could be breeding grounds for these mosquitoes.Public health experts say now is the right time to prepare for and prevent possible outbreaks. Health ministry officials said they have alerted all related agencies to the risk of a dengue outbreak. \nThe Kathmandu Metropolitan City has imparted mental health screening training to doctors and paramedics serving at urban health promotion centres.Officials at the Health Department in the metropolis hope that the move will help hundreds of patients with mental health issues in the city to get timely treatment.“Getting free treatment for mental health problems comes under the right to get free basic health care services,” said Sajina Maharjan, acting head of the department. “Mental health problem screening training to doctors and paramedics will help in the timely diagnosis of the problems and start of early treatment.”At least 32 doctors serving at the urban health promotion centres under the city office and dozens of paramedics participated in five-day screening training. The metropolis has upgraded its urban health clinics to urban health promotion centres and started providing services through medical doctors. “Due to the lack of doctors at our urban health promotion centres, patients suffering from mental health problems have been deprived of timely treatment,” said Nali Bajracharya, a senior public health officer at the department. “Now patients having mental health issues and seeking care at our health centres will also get mental health treatment.”Though neither the federal government agency nor the city office has data on the number of people suffering from mental health problems in the metropolis, doctors estimated that a lot of people could be suffering from various forms of mental health problems—anxiety, depression and others.Officials say that they are also planning to provide free medication to patients with mental health problems.Health workers say that many city dwellers, despite having mental health problems, do not seek treatment and instead turn to drugs and substances to cope. Due to the entrenched social stigma, fear of discrimination and other factors, many patients in Nepal do not talk about their mental health issues.The general tendency among people to conceal mental health issues due to the stigma attached to it has also forced patients to opt for substance abuse, doctors say.They say that while drugs and alcohol may provide temporary relief from stress, they are not a solution and can adversely affect mental health and well-being in the long run.“Treatment in the initial stage of mental illness helps patients achieve better results. For that, early diagnosis is crucial,” said Dr Pomawati Thapa, chief of the Non-communicable Disease and Mental Health Section at the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division. “Other local units should also follow the initiative to provide mental health screening training to health workers, including doctors.”Nepal is among the countries with highest rates of suicide, which is an extreme manifestation of a mental health problem.According to Nepal Police data, 6,993 people took their own lives in the fiscal year 2022-2023. This accounts for more than 19 deaths on average daily. Fifty-six percent of those who die by suicide are men.Doctors say that people do not attempt suicide for a single reason, but due to a complex situation arising from multiple problems.An increasing number of people are struggling with mental problems owing to the rising cost of living and the struggle to manage even their most basic needs, such as food, housing, healthcare and jobs, experts say.Whatever the cause, suicides and suicide attempts have a ripple effect, impacting families, friends, colleagues, communities and societies, doctors say.A study carried out by the Nepal Health Research Council in the past shows that about 13 percent of Nepalis suffer from some form of mental disorder. This means around one in eight Nepalis has mental health issues. Moreover, the country simply does not have enough experts to treat mental health problems, it added.Studies show the magnitude of suffering, the burden and costs for individuals, families and societies arising from mental health disorders are alarming in Nepal.“No doubt, mental health problems have been emerging as a major cause of morbidity and mortality in our country,” said Thapa. “All local governments must take initiative to address the problems. Only the federal government agencies cannot do much.”The World Health Organisation says that one in four people in the world has been affected by mental or neurological disorders at some point in their lives, and around 450 million people currently suffer from such conditions, placing mental disorders among the leading causes of ill health and disability worldwide. \nDuring the 2022 local level election, people of Kathmandu elected independent candidate Balendra Shah as their mayor for five years. Sunita Dangol of the CPN-UML secured the position of KMC deputy mayor in the same election. When they began their term, many suspected that the two—an independent mayor and his party-affiliated deputy—wouldn’t have cordial relations. But, in the last two years of their term, there has been no visible disagreement between them. They proved their sceptics wrong.Deputy Mayor Dangol kept mum when Mayor Shah accused her party chair, KP Sharma Oli, of policy corruption in the Giri Bandhu Tea Estate land scam.Moreover, Shah expressed his anger on June 3 over the government’s intervention in his plan to widen pavements in the New Road area. Deputy Prime Minister Raghubir Mahaseth of the UML leads the Ministry of Physical Infrastructure and Transport, which maintains major roads.After the ministry intervened in the municipal plan to expand the sidewalk on New Road, Shah took to social media and wrote, “Honourable KP Oli jyu, don’t hoodwink people by engineering yet another scam to hide a scam of Rs10,000 crore [Rs100 billion].”He further added, “You have reassured those who had made advance payments to buy land of Giri Bandhu Tea Estate that they would get the land within two years.” “If one looks at the policy corruption in the tea estate, it appears not a single leaf would stir without Oli’s nod,” Shah wrote.A few days prior to the incident, Mayor Shah had engaged in a heated debate with Chinkaji Maharjan, a UML member and chairman of KMC’s ward 22, over the sidewalk expansion plan.Dangol remained quiet on the issue thus far. However, at the city council meeting on Monday, which also discussed KMC's policies and programmes for the fiscal year 2024-25, she criticised Mayor Shah for his remarks.“This should be the first time the deputy mayor opposed the public behavior and statement of the mayor,” a Kathmandu ward chairperson told the Post on the condition of anonymity.Dangol had her initial plan to contest the mayor position independently but the UML gave her the deputy mayor’s ticket.Speaking during the Monday discussion, Deputy Mayor Dangol said, addressing Mayor Shah, “Your and mine voices are being heard and watched by Nepalis worldwide. Therefore, those of us who want to come to politics should think about our expression,” Dangol remarked. “We should maintain the image and dignity of the institution we represent.”She also emphasised the need to accommodate the voices of everyone in an undertaking.Though the representatives of Kathmandu Metropolitan City claim that Dangol's Monday statement was unusual, they deny any rift between the two leaders of the local government. “City council’s is an internal meeting of the KMC where various issues arise. We settle those issues internally,” Nabin Manandhar, the KMC spokesperson and ward 17 chairman from the Nepali Congress, told the Post. “Having an opinion does not necessarily mean criticism.”Rajesh Kumar Shrestha, chair of KMC ward 19, seconded Manandhar.However, local representatives of Kathmandu have been questioning Shah for his ‘lone-wolf’ manner of leading the institution.“We should develop a working relationship that welcomes everyone’s spirit,” Dangol told the council meeting. “If one thinks they are in a position and everything should be done as they say, it will only lead to trouble.”She added, “While working in a team, we definitely have a different opinion, but different opinions should be respected.”At the meeting, referring to Mayor Shah's past statements, council member Anita Karki asked him, saying, “What if the voters of Kathmandu set ablaze the Durbar where the KMC office lies?”In September last year, when the traffic police obstructed a KMC vehicle, later known to be used by his postpartum wife, Mayor Shah provocatively wrote on Facebook, threatening to burn Singha Durbar, the federal government’s central secretariat.Traffic police, under the federal government, had stopped the vehicle to check necessary documents on a Saturday.After the incident, Shah wrote on social media warning that if the government blocked KMC's vehicles again, he would set fire to Singha Durbar.Dangol said on Monday that she believed it was wrong to write on social media or make a statement inciting people to burn the Singha Durbar or the Bagh Durbar, where the KMC office is situated.Dangol, speaking at the city council meeting, also said there should be no polarisation between the representatives who were elected to develop Kathmandu. \nAD CLUB, a dynamic and autonomous entity under the Advertising Association of Nepal (AAN), hosted a successful networking event on July 12 to mark the establishment of its new board. AD CLUB is a hub for advertising and marketing professionals, a vital platform for individuals and organisations within the advertising and marketing communication landscape.

Galaxy Z Flip6 (12+256 GB) is priced at Rs154,999, Galaxy Z Fold6 (12+256 GB) costs Rs234,999 and Galaxy Z Fold6 (12+512 GB) is priced at Rs249,999. \nSiddhartha International Hotel Limited, a prominent name in Nepal’s hospitality sector, is set to launch its initial public offering (IPO). The company has appointed Muktinath Capital as the issue manager. Chintamani Neupane, chairman of Siddhartha Hospitality Group and Kabindra Dhoj Joshi, CEO of Muktinath Capital, signed the agreement on behalf of their respective organisations.Siddhartha International Hotel Limited operates the luxurious Siddhartha Boutique Hotel in Baudha and the Siddhartha Vilasa in Bhairahawa. Siddhartha Hospitality oversees more than two dozen companies, including Siddhartha Vilasa (five-star), Siddhartha Vaibhav (four-star), and Siddhartha Vatika (three-star), along with ventures in hospitality education, restaurants, cottages, cafes, agricultural farms, trading, and IT services. \nThe International Monetary Fund (IMF) has inserted a separate annex on savings and credit cooperatives in its staff country report, flagging a risk to Nepal’s economy that could trigger social unrest if the ongoing problems are not sorted out.It said that several cooperatives have collapsed in the past six months, causing a loss or freezing of client savings and creating small-scale social unrest. The international financial institution released the full text of the IMF staff country report on Tuesday. It warned that problems in the savings and cooperatives sector are expanding.The main cause of the failure is investment in illiquid and underperforming assets of cooperatives, which impact repayment capacity, combined with some cases of fraud.The IMF said in the statement that a combination of large data gaps, weak governance, unsound credit and liquidity risk management, and a lack of licensing, effective regulation, monitoring, and supervision resulted in the failure and closure of multiple cooperatives.On May 28, the lower house formed a seven-member parliamentary committee to investigate cooperatives fraud.Immediate past home minister Rabi Lamichhane, who is also president of Rastriya Swatantra Party, has been accused of embezzling millions of rupees from multiple cooperatives while he headed the Gorkha Media Network before entering politics.The IMF said that authorities need a comprehensive strategy to deal with the issues in cooperatives.It said that over 14,000 cooperatives hold an estimated Rs478 billion of savings deposits, one-twelfth the size of banking sector deposits as of June 2023.“There is an increasing risk of negative spillovers to other cooperatives and the smallest regulated banks,” the IMF said. On Tuesday, a delegation of the Central Cooperatives and Poverty Alleviation Department of the ruling CPN-UML submitted a 12-point suggestion to the newly appointed minister for Land Management, Cooperatives and Poverty Alleviation, Balaram Adhikari. “We have suggested ensuring that depositors’ money is safe in cooperatives,” said Khagraj Adhikari, chief of the department and former chief minister of Gandaki Province. “We have demanded immediate action against the people involved in the irregularities and cooperatives fraud.” He said the cooperatives, which can be established as a strong economic pillar, need major reforms. The delegation has recommended forming a high-level, powerful task force to address the issues in the sector. The erstwhile Pushpa Kamal Dahal-led government, on May 28, while unveiling the budget for 2024-25, had promised to return at least Rs500,000 to each depositor by recovering it from the directors’ assets. Yet doubts persist over whether depositors will get their money back.Some economists have warned about potential mass protests if the cooperatives issue is not resolved soon.The IMF has recommended a strategy of central coordination of the 761 district and provincial cooperatives regulators to facilitate the cleanup of the problematic cooperatives. It said that reforms in the supervisory and regulatory architecture are needed. “Given likely limited resources, this strategy needs to ensure that the largest financially sound cooperatives remain stable and are appropriately regulated while dealing with problematic cooperatives.”Nepal has a large and vibrant cooperative sector regulated by many agencies. There are around 32,000 registered cooperatives. In addition to cooperatives, which focus on providing savings and loan services, cooperatives are active in areas such as agriculture, forestry and several other activities. These non-financial cooperatives can allocate up to 30 percent of their activities to savings and loan services. According to the IMF, there are more than 14,000 cooperatives and around 10,000 non-financial cooperatives that also provide financial services. As of June 2023, cooperatives held Rs478 billion in savings deposits and Rs426 billion in assets. Cooperatives are regulated based on their geographical scope—at the federal, provincial, or local level. As a result, there are a maximum of 761 different regulators. If a cooperative is declared problematic, the relevant regulator must appoint a Problematic Cooperatives Asset Management Committee. Since mid-2023, pressures in the Nepali cooperatives have been mounting. Gauri Bahadur Karki, former chair of the Special Court and the head of an inquiry commission formed in 2013 to investigate troubled saving and credit cooperatives, told the Post last year that cooperatives were in trouble after the government halted plotting of land in 2022. “Most cooperatives’ operation model involves investing in land and paying interest after generating profits from selling such land. With the government abruptly halting plotting, many cooperatives failed to sell the land, which resulted in their failure to pay promised interest, and the depositors who could not recover their money had to stage protests.”According to Karki, other problems included investing in land and misappropriation of funds by the cooperatives’ promoters.The IMF said that the Department of Land Management, Cooperatives and Poverty Alleviation, and subnational authorities are reportedly declaring an increasing number of cooperatives problematic, implying the need for decisive intervention to prevent further contagion. The IMF has recommended three kinds of steps to deal with the issue: immediate steps, near-term steps (within one year), and medium-term steps (1-2 years).In the immediate steps, the IMF has recommended halting the registration of new cooperatives. The current registration does not provide the same scrutiny as licensing, and adequate supervision is not currently guaranteed. It said a temporary stop on registering new cooperatives at federal, provincial, and local levels until the issues have been addressed and the licensing and supervisory process and capacity have been improved would be appropriate. “Resolution options in the strategy should follow the existing legal framework and could focus on liquidation combined with repayment of savings of failed cooperatives, possibly the transfer of assets and liabilities of failed cooperatives to healthy cooperatives or their continuation after restructuring.” Near-term steps involve tightening and enforcing existing regulatory requirements. The recent crisis reveals flaws in applying the legislative and regulatory framework. The bar for cooperatives must be raised while customising the requirements to the size and nature of the businesses and a realistic supervision capacity. Authorities could tighten existing regulatory requirements in capitalisation, liquidity, loan concentration, and governance. Cooperatives should be required to report regularly. They could be given a certain period to meet the requirements, and compliance with these needs to be closely monitored. The medium-term step involves starting to license cooperatives. As a proper authorisation and licensing process hasn’t been established under the current regime, licensing is needed for both existing cooperatives and new entities.The licensing regime should include a mechanism for the regulator to verify compliance and a process for treating cases of significant non-compliance (which could result in the withdrawal or suspension of the licence). The IMF has recommended ensuring that the Cooperatives Act includes creating a debt information centre, credit tribunal, and savings and guarantee fund for cooperatives. These institutions could be aligned with existing structures, the global organisation said. For example, the debt information centre could be set up within the Credit Information Bureau, allowing all financial institutions access to information on debtors. The savings and guarantee fund could be modelled on the Nepali Deposit Insurance System, which the country started in 2010. Under this scheme, deposit guarantee coverage is up to Rs500,000 per individual per member institution, applicable to savings and fixed deposits. \nIn a bid to lessen the high prevalence of anaemia among adolescent girls, the Ministry of Health and Population has decided to administer iron-folic acid to all girls aged between 10 and 19 from the ongoing fiscal year.The supplementation programme will be implemented in private schools from the new fiscal year, and female community health volunteers will administer the supplement tablets to girls, who do not go to schools, officials said.“All 27,90,562 girls aged between 10 and 19 years will be administered iron-folic acid,” said Lila Bikram Thapa, chief of the Nutrition Section at the Family Welfare Division under the Department of Health Services. “The supplement tablets have been supplied by agencies under the federal government. Provincial and local government agencies have been requested to coordinate with private schools and other stakeholders to implement the programme.”Anaemia is a condition in which blood produces low levels of haemoglobin or healthy red blood cells. Iron and other nutritional deficiencies, malaria, hookworm infection, chronic infections, and genetic conditions, including sickle cell diseases, are among the causes for anaemia. Studies show that 39 percent of girls aged 10 and 19 years and 21 percent of boys of the same age group suffer from anaemia in Nepal. Health authorities however, have been preparing the supplement administration programme only for girls.Health officials said that they have also been considering providing the supplement tablets to boys as well, as several countries have already started administering iron-folic acid to boys.Doctors say anaemia in adults can cause fatigue, lethargy, reduced physical productivity, and poor work performance. It is a major concern among pregnant women, as problems can lead to increased maternal mortality rates and poor birth outcomes.The Health Ministry has been providing the supplement at government schools across the country since 2016. Some local levels had already been administering the supplement tablets in private schools.Thapa said that all schools, whether government or private, will implement the supplementation programme from the new fiscal year. Under the programme, eligible girls will be administered a supplement tablet every week for three months. They will be administered the tablet again after three months and continued for 13 weeks. Thapa said that 26 supplement tablets will be administered per person in a year.The Nepal Demographic and Health Survey-2022 conducted by the ministry shows that 43 percent of the children aged between six to 59 months have been found to be anaemic—25 percent mildly anaemic, 18 percent moderately anaemic and one percent severely anaemic.The prevalence of anaemia in children aged between six to 59 months has decreased from 53 percent in 2016 to 43 percent in 2022. However, the trend has not been consistently downward. In 2006, around 48 percent of children were found to be anaemic. Prevalence of anaemia in the above-mentioned age group was found to be high—50.6 percent in the Madhesh Province, followed by 48.9 percent in Lumbini, 45.4 percent in Sudurpaschim, 42.5 percent in Bagmati, 39.8 percent in Karnali, 33.9 percent in Koshi and 30.7 percent in Gandaki Province.Women living in the Tarai region are more likely to be anaemic (45 percent) than those living in the hills (20 percent) and in the mountainous regions (23 percent), the survey showed. More than half the women (52 percent) are anaemic in the Madhesh Province.In the 1990s, 75 percent of pregnant women in Nepal were found to be suffering from anaemia.Anaemia during pregnancy increases the risk of foetal growth retardation and low birth weight, premature delivery, increased perinatal mortality, and reduced resistance to infection for both mother and baby. Thapa said anaemia is a serious concern for children as it can impair their cognitive development and can have long-term health and economic implications for society. He said that health agencies have been asked to conduct classes in schools to make students aware of hygienic behaviour, nutritious food, and the negative effects of junk food on health.Meanwhile, the Department of Drug Administration has recalled Folicare Tablet (folic acid tablet) batch TES-032 manufactured by Nepali pharmaceutical company Curex Pharmaceuticals Pvt Ltd due to quality issues. \nIn a bid to reduce patient deaths in hospital emergencies, the Ministry of Health and Population has started providing basic life support training to health workers.Officials hope that ongoing deaths in hospital emergencies would come down significantly once health workers were trained in basic life support.“Around 900 health workers, including medical doctors, nurses, paramedics, and health assistants, have already been trained with basic life support skills,” said Dr Prakash Budhathoky, spokesman for the ministry. “The remaining health workers will receive training in the new fiscal year.”Basic life support is a type of care that first responders, who could be health workers serving in hospital emergencies, provide to anyone suffering from cardiac arrest, respiratory distress and other life-threatening conditions.Experts say basic life support is very crucial in emergency situations—cardiac arrest, and trauma cases, among others. The procedure includes recognising and responding to emergency situations, seeking help, performing cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and providing breathing assistance.Chances of survival will be high if trained health workers respond to the cases first. Officials said that the number of patient deaths in emergencies could be reduced significantly if all health workers serving in hospital emergencies were trained with basic life support skills.“We will also encourage provincial governments to provide basic life support skills to health workers serving in provincial hospitals and health centres run by local units,” said Budhathoky. “Those serving in emergencies at private health facilities will also get this training.”Doctors say that basic life support skills can be effective in saving lives when provided promptly and correctly. Health officials say many health workers serving in emergencies of health facilities, especially those hired newly, do not have basic life support skills.Meanwhile, the Nepal Medical Council, the national regulatory body for medical doctors, said it is working to make continuous professional development training mandatory for licence renewal.“Doctors must pass a 100-mark test on ethics, basic life support, communication, infection control and the rational use of medicines,” said Dr Bishwa Raj Dawadi, the council member. “Gone are the days when one would remain a doctor simply by obtaining a medical degree. They must be updated with skills and new knowledge.”A few years ago, the Council made professional development training mandatory for all medical doctors. Failure to attend the course will result in non-renewal of the medical licence.Medical doctors undergo the training regularly, and the council assesses its effectiveness every five years to ensure that doctors providing health care services are updated in their profession.Professional training involves processes that act as refresher courses to update and enhance a doctor’s knowledge, skills, and experience, even after the completion of their formal degree. It can take the form of fellowships, seminars, workshops, conferences, and continuous medical education.The NMC said that CPD (continuous professional development training) is a lifelong process of learning and updating professional skills.Doctors also need to take effective communication skills training so that they can communicate with the families and relatives of patients about their condition and the treatment process, including surgeries. In recent years, there have been reports of scuffles between hospitals/doctors and the kin of patients in the event of a patient’s death. At times, situations have taken a nasty turn in which doctors have been manhandled and hospitals vandalised.The medical council said that implementation of the code of ethics has been a challenge thus far and that training such as the CPD could help in its effective enforcement. One of the problems the NMC is facing currently is its inability to prevent doctors and health institutions from advertising their skills and profession using mass media, which, according to the NMC, is against the code of ethics. \nIn a bid to support midwives and other healthcare personnel in ensuring safer births in low-resource settings, the Ministry of Health and Population has launched a “safe delivery app”.Officials hope that the mobile application will complement and enhance the ongoing capacity-building of health workers and help in reducing maternal and newborn deaths.“The Safe Delivery App provides up-to-date lifesaving procedures and practical guidance in the local language,” said Dr Bibek Kumar Lal, director of the Family Welfare Division under the Department of Health Services, at the launch of the Nepali version of the Safe Delivery App. “It aims to improve the quality of emergency obstetric and newborn care, and the main users will be our frontline health workers, especially nurses and midwives.”Officials at the division said that the government has collaborated with the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) and the Maternity Foundation (MF) to launch the Nepali version of the widely used digital health tool.Globally, every two minutes, a woman dies. In Nepal, two women die every day due to pregnancy-related complications—most of which are preventable, said Won Young Hong, a UNFPA representative in Nepal. “These are staggering numbers. UNFPA is pleased to work with the concerned stakeholders to localise this digital application so healthcare workers across Nepal can use it.”The Safe Delivery App is an evidence-based learning and training tool designed to support midwives, nurses, and other healthcare professionals to assist during births and to manage the most common complications. Among other features, it contains the latest clinical guidelines, animated instruction videos, descriptions of practical procedures, and action cards. It is free, and once downloaded on a smartphone or a tablet, it works offline, making it possible to be used even in the most remote areas. To date, more than 435,000 healthcare professionals across more than 70 countries have been reached through the Safe Delivery App and the accompanying programme worldwide, with Nepal being the latest country to introduce the App. “We will work with provincial governments and development partners to quickly roll out the App throughout Nepal,” said Lal.Nepal cut the maternal mortality rate from 539 per 100,000 births in 1996 to 239 per 100,000 births in 2016—for which the country even received a Millennium Award. According to the National Statistics Office report, the country has further reduced the number of deaths to 151 per 100,000 births in 2021. Maternal health experts, however, say that even if the country has made good progress in reducing maternal deaths, the current maternal mortality ratio is more than double the Sustainable Development Goals target, which is 70 maternal deaths per 100,000 live births by 2030.Neonatal deaths have not declined between 2016 and 2022, according to the Nepal Demographic and Health Survey-2022 carried out by the Ministry of Health and Population.The government’s target for the Sustainable Development Goals was to reduce neonatal mortality to 16 deaths per 1,000 live births by 2022 and 12 in every 1,000 live births by 2030.The SDGs, a follow-up on the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), aim to end poverty, hunger, and all forms of inequality worldwide by 2030, and Nepal has committed to meeting the goals.The health ministry has been taking several measures to reduce maternal and neonatal deaths, including installing an underfloor heating system at birthing centres, setting up special newborn care units, training doctors, nurses, and paramedics in the district hospitals and distributing non-pneumatic anti-shock garments to prevent maternal deaths from excessive bleeding.Besides, the ministry provides free service and travel allowances for those opting for institutional delivery and antenatal visits. It also distributes misoprostol, a medication used to treat postpartum bleeding in new mothers, through female community health volunteers. \nAs heavy monsoon rains cause chaos across the country, dengue cases are surging in several districts, including Kathmandu.According to the Health Office Kathmandu, around 18 people are infected with the dengue virus every day. Officials, however, admit that this number could be just the tip of the iceberg, as the office gets reports only from 18 health facilities.“Yes, the number of people infected with the dengue virus could be several times higher than suggested by the reports we are getting every day,” said Dr Arjun Sapkota, chief of the Health Office, Kathmandu. “We are working to make daily reporting of dengue cases mandatory for private health facilities as well.”Dengue is a viral disease transmitted by female Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes. The same vectors also transmit chikungunya, yellow fever, and Zika virus, according to the World Health Organisation.According to data provided by the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division, at least 1,432 people from 73 districts have been infected with the virus since January this year. Among the 73 districts that reported dengue outbreaks, Kathmandu has the highest number of cases with 159, followed by Jhapa with 120, Chitwan 83, Makawanpur 65, Tanahun and Doti 49 cases each, and Okhaldhunga and Sindhupalchowk 46 each.Sapkota informed that his office has sensitised the local bodies about the looming risk of a massive dengue outbreak in the coming days.“Mandatory reporting of dengue cases every day is among the preventive measures through which we can identify dengue hotspots,” said Sapkota. “This will help health workers target such measures in particular areas. Additionally, starting this week, we are resuming the “10 minutes at 10 am” initiative every Friday, during which mosquito breeding grounds will be destroyed.”Officials informed that several local units, including the Kathmandu Metropolitan City, have already started preventive measures against dengue. Dengue symptoms include mild to high fever, severe muscle pain, rashes, severe headache, and pain in the eyes. Patients with these symptoms are advised to seek immediate treatment. While there is no specific cure for the disease, early detection and proper medical care can prevent death.Doctors say many people infected with dengue show mild symptoms and can be treated with paracetamol at home.Nepal reported its first dengue case in a foreigner in 2004 in the Chitwan district. Since then, an increasing number of dengue infections, including major outbreaks, have been reported from many districts. Last year, at least 20 persons died, and more than 52,000 were infected by the virus, which had spread to all 77 districts.In 2022, a total of 88 people died, and over 54,000 were infected by the virus across the country. During that period, hospitals in the Kathmandu Valley were overwhelmed with dengue patients, and pharmacies ran out of paracetamol, the most widely used medicine to treat fever.In 2019, the disease killed at least six people and more than 16,000 were hospitalised across the country. The virus had spread to 68 districts at the time.Though the post-monsoon period is considered the dengue epidemic season, the deadly disease has already become endemic in Nepal, as outbreaks are reported every month, including in the winter months.According to health workers, storage places for scrap materials, discarded cups, plastic material tossed in open spaces, and unused lands will be potential hotspots for the dengue virus in the coming days. Health workers have warned the owners of these sites that action will be taken if mosquito larvae are found there.Dengue-transmitting mosquitoes breed in clean water and bite people in daylight. Uncovered water tanks and discarded objects, such as plastic cups and bottles, could be breeding grounds for these mosquitoes. \nWith monsoon havoc sweeping across the country, the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division has urged health workers to avoid taking leave during the season.Officials have warned that health facilities could be overwhelmed by patients in the coming days as outbreaks of waterborne and vector-borne diseases are expected, as floodwaters have contaminated most of the drinking water sources.“We have requested the provincial and local health authorities not to grant leave to health workers during the monsoon season,” said Dr Yadu Chandra Ghimire, director of the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division. “Health agencies have been cautioned about the looming risk of outbreaks of waterborne and vector-borne diseases in the coming days.”Torrential rainfall started Friday wreaking havoc in various places across the country. At least 14 people have died in disaster-related incidents—nine in landslides and five in floods—since Friday, according to the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Authority. Officials said 18 others have been injured, and four people are missing. Since the monsoon entered the country on June 10, at least 43 people have died in landslides and flood-related incidents. Lightning strikes killed as many as 19 people during this period.The monsoon season in Nepal is a time of epidemics during which thousands of people across the country become infected with water-borne and vector-borne diseases.The persistent rainfall that started on Friday not only destroyed houses and inundated settlements but also contaminated drinking water sources.Health officials warned that health facilities could witness an uptick in the number of viral fever cases, and waterborne diseases—diarrhoea, dysentery, food poisoning, and snake bites—in the coming days.“We have also requested central hospitals and medical colleges to be prepared for help during disease outbreaks,” said Ghimire. “As we don’t have enough doctors and health workers to deploy to control the outbreaks, we have to seek help from big hospitals and medical colleges.”Officials at the Ministry of Health and Population said that they have been raising awareness through all available means to inform people of the risks. “Essential medicines have been stockpiled, health workers have been asked to be ready for deployment to affected areas, anti-snake venom has been supplied to health facilities,” said Dr Prakash Budhathoki, spokesperson at the Health Ministry. “As of Sunday evening, no outbreaks have been reported.”According to health experts, sources of drinking water generally become contaminated in disaster-hit areas, and people displaced by natural disasters become highly vulnerable to infections with waterborne and vector-borne diseases. Every year, thousands of people get infected with vector-borne diseases such as dengue, kala-azar, malaria, and scrub typhus during this period. Last year, at least 20 persons died, and more than 52,000 were infected by the virus, which had spread to all 77 districts. According to data provided by the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division, at least 1,432 people from 73 districts have been infected with the dengue virus since January this year. Among the 73 districts that reported dengue outbreaks, Kathmandu has the highest number of cases: 159. Public health experts say reported cases could be just the tip of the iceberg, as around 80 percent of those infected are asymptomatic. Likewise, snakebite incidents and resulting deaths are also common during the season, but the phenomenon, which experts dub “a lurking invisible crisis”, remains grossly neglected. “Incidents of snakebites have started to surge over the last few weeks,” said Dr Rajiv Jha, director at Provincial Health Directorate of Madhesh Province. “Along with the surge in waterborne and vector-borne diseases in the coming days, we have anticipated a rise in snakebite cases.”Doctors say the only ways to prevent deaths from waterborne diseases, including diarrhoea, are to raise awareness and ensure safe drinking water.They say a combination of careful surveys, ensuring safe drinking water, maintaining sanitation and hygiene, social mobilisation and treatment are required to contain the spread of the diarrhoeal infection. \nI can vividly remember my first encounter with baking when I was 10 years old. We had just moved to our new home and got a cable connection. The cable opened a world of possibilities, as it gave me access to various contents.This was back in the late 2000s when YouTube would take hours to load, taunting us with its buffering screen. I was particularly drawn to travel and lifestyle channels, mainly TLC, Fox Life, and Food Network, which kept me informed about different foods and cultures. I don’t know why, but I was always drawn to desserts. It was fascinating to see how these miraculous treats made people smile at the end of the meal.Growing up in Nepal, I noticed that baking wasn't very common. While some families did have ovens, they were mostly multifunctional ones used primarily for heating food.I also noticed that most of our desserts didn't require an oven, as they could be made on a stovetop. So, you can imagine my excitement when my mom decided to buy an oven during one of her festive shopping sprees.I could finally feel the joy these channels portrayed. (I blame food writer Nigella Lawson for getting me hooked on a domestic lifestyle.) Then, one day, after watching one of the cooking episodes on television, I finally mustered enough strength and decided to bake something. I distinctly remember wanting to make a chocolate cake for myself after watching one of Rachel Allen’s bake series. I watched all the ingredients used in that recipe and scurried across my pantry, only to realise I didn’t have half of the stuff she mentioned. I then decided to improvise the recipe (a big mistake). I randomly combined the ingredients that I had in a mixing bowl and chucked the batter into my oven, hoping for a magical cake to pop out an hour later.After I saw the result an hour later, I was mortified. The cake was stuck in the pan, refusing to come out, and it was as dense as fudge. I convinced myself that the taste was what mattered most, but when I served a slice to my brother, he made a face of utter disgust.That was the day I realised that baking soda was not the same as baking powder.After this incident, I researched baking and found out it was technical. This was a blessing in disguise for me, as I loved science, and I started to view baking as a science experiment. I then reflected and evaluated how to perfect one's baking skills.I analysed my errors and noted down all the steps I did every time I baked. Home baking is a passion for many. The idea of turning a few simple ingredients into a delicious masterpiece is as enchanting as it sounds.Yet, for many of us, this seemingly magical process can often turn into a series of unfortunate events, leading to crumbled dreams and deflated ambitions. Dense cakes, burnt crusts, rock-hard cookies and unrisen bread, if you are an amateur baker, then you have seen it all. But why do these mishaps happen so often? And most importantly how do we overcome them?From my experience, behind every successful bake lies a series of challenges and mishaps that test even the most dedicated bakers. Baking has its own set of rules that you need to follow to get that scrumptious treat every time. So, to transform a recipe into an actual dish that will impress your friends and family, I am sharing with you some of the tips and tricks I learned from my tumultuous journey as a home baker.First things first, we have to look into the prime appliance that we are working with. Commercial ovens are of two types: one that runs on gas and the other that runs on electricity. We have to look at the oven present at our home and consider its pros and cons. The main benefits of a gas oven are its size and temperature control. One can quickly change the temperature just by twisting the knob, and it preheats much more quickly than an electric one. However, they are known to have uneven temperatures at times and release more humidity, making it harder to properly crisp or brown food. This can result in burnt edges and cold or hot spots. An electric oven, on the other hand, provides more even and consistent temperatures and doesn’t release as much moisture in the air.This dry oven environment makes it easier to brown your items, making it great for baking bread. However, while the dry oven results in more even cooking, you also run the risk of drying out cakes and other baked goods.Also, many people forget to preheat the oven before baking, which is crucial for maintaining an even temperature throughout the baking process. When baking cakes and bread, I like to place a small tray of water at the bottom of the oven to provide moisture and prevent the baked goods from drying out.An oven thermometer can be a baker's best friend, providing a true reading and ensuring your creations bake evenly. I also like rotating the pan midway while baking, as it allows for an even distribution of heat.The next thing people mess up on is measuring and the specificity of ingredients in a recipe. Our moms made our food with their instinct; it is something that they learned along the way, but when you are baking, you cannot instinctively add or omit a few steps.I think that is why we initially had problems with baking. In a culture where cooking comes instinctually, baking challenges us, to be precise. A gram of more or less of any ingredient can drastically alter the outcome. Different methods of measuring flour can yield different results.Every component in baking serves a distinct purpose and function. Flour offers structure, sugar adds sweetness and moisture, eggs bind things together, and butter enhances taste and texture. However, not all ingredients are created equally. For example, using salted butter instead of unsalted might change the taste profile of your meal.Similarly, different flours have varying protein concentrations, which affect the texture of baked goods. The type of sugar used also makes a difference. Granulated sugar, brown sugar, powdered sugar, and speciality sugars like turbinado or muscovado each add unique flavours to a bake.Understanding these nuances and how they interact is critical for getting the intended outcomes. Accurate measurement tools and techniques are essential, but mastering them can be a steep learning curve. So, I would recommend investing in a kitchen scale that allows for more accurate measurements by weight rather than volume.Moving on, leavening agents such as baking soda, baking powder, and yeast are required to make baked goods rise. However, they can also cause confusion and errors. Baking soda needs an acidic component to activate, but baking powder has both an acid and a base, making it self-activating.Using the wrong type of flour or sugar, or using them in incorrect proportions, can result in flat, overly raised, or collapsed cakes. Yeast, being a living organism, presents its challenges.The water temperature must be just right—not too hot to kill the yeast, nor too cold to inhibit its activity. Proofing times and conditions also need to be carefully managed to achieve the perfect rise.Bakers should also be careful about the way they mix ingredients. The method of mixing ingredients can significantly impact the final product. Over-mixing can develop too much gluten in cakes and pastries, leading to tough textures.Under-mixing can leave pockets of unincorporated ingredients, resulting in uneven bakes. Techniques like folding, creaming, and whipping each serve specific purposes and must be executed with care.Finally, home bakers must understand the importance of timing and patience in baking. Even a minute or two can make the difference between perfectly baked cookies and burnt edges.Recipes often provide a range for baking times, but factors like oven hot spots, pan material, and altitude can affect these times. It’s crucial to keep a close eye on your bakes and rely on visual and tactile cues, such as a cake pulling away from the sides of the pan or a toothpick coming out clean, to determine doneness.Baking is also an exercise in patience, a virtue not everyone possesses. Doughs need time to rest and rise, flavours need time to meld, and baked goods need time to cool before they can be enjoyed.Impatience can lead to underbaked centres, crumbling slices, and a general sense of frustration. Cultivating patience is as important as mastering any technique in the baker’s repertoire.Home baking is a journey full of ups and downs, but it comes with great rewards. The obstacles encountered teach valuable lessons in patience, precision, and perseverance.The satisfaction of success, the freedom to create, and the therapeutic benefits make the endeavour meaningful. Whether baking for oneself, loved ones, or as an artistic outlet, the journey is as fulfilling as the result. Embrace the flour-dusted countertops, occasional setbacks, and the joys of home bakingFor a beginner-friendly recipe that involves mixing ingredients and delivers amazing results, try my recipe for fudgy, nutty brownies that I call ‘Bliss Brownies’.Bliss Brownies150g unsalted butter plus extra for the tin150g chopped dark chocolate200g caster sugar½ tsp baking powder2 eggs80g cocoa powder150g plain flour70g mixture of nuts (walnuts and almonds)60g blended papayaMix all the ingredients (except the dark chocolate and nuts) in a blender or a food processor and blitz till you get a smooth paste.Fold the chocolate and the nuts into the brownie batter, making sure that the pieces are evenly mixed in.Grease a loaf pan with soft butter and dust with cocoa powder. Pour the batter into the loaf pan.Bake in a preheated oven at 170c for 40 minutes and let it cool in the oven for an hour. Enjoy with a cup of coffee or, as I like it, a scoop of vanilla ice cream. \nIn a world where acceptance and safety often seem difficult to attain, many queer individuals also struggle to find a safe space to express themselves. They have to hide their true self and face relentless judgement when going to public places like cafes and restaurants.This is the reality for countless LGBTQIA+ individuals. The need for a safe space for this community is not just a desire but a necessity—a space where one can be themselves. This struggle for safety and acceptance can be traced to crucial historical moments, such as the Stonewall Riots of 1969 in New York City.The Stonewall Inn was more than a bar; it was a refuge for the queer community. When police raided the bar, the community fought back. This series of violent confrontations, which began in the early hours of June 28, 1969, between police and gay rights activists, marked the beginning of the modern LGBTQIA+ rights movement. The spirit of Stonewall, the fight for dignity and the right to exist openly lives on in places like Inclusive Galaxy Restaurant in Kathmandu. Inclusive Galaxy beyond a restaurant is an ‘oasis’ for the queer community and beyond.Founded by Bishwaraj Adhikari, Mr Gay Handsome Nepal 2013, a human rights defender, the restaurant proves the power of safe spaces. It’s a place where the community can unite, free from the prejudice and hostility that often permeate their everyday lives.After years of working in the human rights sector, Adhikari and his partner developed the idea for Inclusive Galaxy. What began as a small cafe gradually evolved into a full-fledged restaurant, driven by the growing demand and support from the community.“In developed countries with strong LGBTQIA+ movements, you can find community areas like gay villages. These are created as safe spaces for people whose families and communities have excluded them. They also support new business ideas and pink tourism. I hope to see pink tourism develop in Nepal someday,” says Adhikari. His vision for Inclusive Galaxy goes beyond just being a restaurant. He aims to promote financial independence and empowerment within the queer community.Since its inception in February 2019, Inclusive Galaxy has become a key spot for many in Lazimpat, a relatively queer-friendly area in Kathmandu. The location is essential because the first LGBTQIA+ movement in Nepal started in 2001 through the Blue Diamond Society.Inclusive Galaxy, true to its name, welcomes everyone—queer and non-queer alike—to share a comfortable space. His vision was clear: to create a space where people of all genders and sexual identities could come together without fear of exclusion.“I didn’t want to make it exclusively for queer people because that would be excluding ourselves from society. Different groups need to live together and understand each other,” Adhikari explains.In the early days, the cafe attracted both queer and non-queer customers. However, when some of the residents learned about Adhikari’s identity and the nature of the clientele, there was a brief period of hesitation. “At first, I didn’t understand what was happening, but then I realised my identity was an issue for a few people. I believe people should be judged by others by their character, not by their gender or sexuality. Over time, as residents saw that we operated like any other cafe, they became more comfortable,” Adhikari reflects.Adhikari started Inclusive Galaxy to give queer individuals a place to be proud of themselves, counteracting the self-doubt and insecurity that hiding one’s identity can cause. This turned the cafe very quickly into a community hub. The journey was not without challenges, though. It was difficult to hire staff and cooks from the LGBTQIA+ community, and soon after the restaurant opened, the COVID pandemic made things even harder.Despite these difficulties, the doors of Inclusive Galaxy remained open. During the pandemic, many queer individuals, who were abandoned by their families or afraid to return home, found comfort at Inclusive Galaxy.Since many couldn’t afford to pay for meals, the restaurant provided free food from its resources. As the number of people needing meals grew to 20-30 daily, Adhikari started raising funds within the community.“During my time as an activist, many people came here not only for food but also to see an organisation where the queer community supports one another,” Adhikari says.“The time during COVID was difficult, but it brought me closer to the community.”Four years after its inception, the restaurant has garnered a loyal following. Sarosy Neupane, Miss Pink Nepal 2024 first runner-up, describes Inclusive Galaxy as her second home. She moved to Kathmandu to study in 2022. Being distant from her family, she started visiting Galaxy for meals that reminded her of home-cooked food. Over time, she grew attached to the café because of its welcoming atmosphere.“It’s heartwarming to see people from our community and different walks of life here. The founders even invite us to festivals like ‘Dahi Chiura Khane din,’” she shares.Neupane visits the cafe regularly and sometimes stays until 3 am, engrossed in conversations. “I hope more spaces like this can open in the future. If, unfortunately, this place were to close someday, I don’t think we’d have any other place to turn to,” she adds.Muna Chhetri, a trans woman who has been a loyal customer for three years, shares, “This is my safe space where I can truly be myself. I always feel judged in other restaurants, but that fear doesn’t exist here. It’s where even those who aren’t accepted at home can feel accepted.”Sahara Khadka Chhetri, owner of Pink Tiffany, Kathmandu’s first openly LGBTIQIA+ friendly restaurant and bar, frequently visits after managing the bar, appreciating the convenience of not cooking at home.She notes very few places like this cater to our community, and some even had to close during COVID. “As an entrepreneur, I know that sustaining these spaces is a challenge. But as more spaces like these open, they will make the way for a more inclusive and compassionate society.”The welcoming atmosphere at Inclusive Galaxy has also had a surprising effect on non-queer patrons. Samriddha Jung Rana, a twenty-year-old neighbour who identifies as straight, often visits the café and appreciates the importance of such spaces.“Previously, I didn’t know much about the queer community and didn’t care much. But now, coming into this café, I’ve been interested in their rights and issues. I’ve realised that we’re not so different after all. We are all human,” he remarks.The ventures like Inclusive Galaxy and Pink Tiffany have inspired hope for collaborative businesses between queer and non-queer groups. The recent initiative by the Nepal Tourism Board promoting Pink Tourism in April 2024 is a positive step. Still, Adhikari believes that more support is needed from the government and the private sector.Despite the progress, challenges remain. However, Adhikari remains optimistic about the future. He is working on plans to develop the restaurant into a homestay program in the future.“Like how different planets, asteroids, and stars make up a beautiful galaxy, people from all walks of life and identities make a beautiful society. I am happy that we are assimilating together in this space. We are not so different; we are all different and similar simultaneously,” he says. \nAditya Mishra is a Nepali chef and entrepreneur based in New York. Passionate about elevating Nepali cuisine globally, Mishra sharpened his culinary skills while staging at various Michelin-starred restaurants in the city during his time at culinary school. A recipient of the James Beard Foundation National Scholars Scholarship in 2023, Mishra’s early experiences inspired him to establish his own supper club, ‘The Sewing Tin’, alongside co-founder Akhil Upad.In an interview with Post’s Aarati Ray, Mishra discusses his restaurant in New York, serving Nepali cuisines there and the recipe for his signature dish.How did your cooking journey start in New York?At 14, I told my parents I wanted to be a chef, but they preferred I pursue a stable career like engineering, as many Nepali families do. So, I left for Louisiana in 2019 to study engineering.But, cooking never left my heart so, after a year, I left engineering college and moved to New York City. It’s been three and a half years and my parents only learned about it later. When my mom visited me in NYC and saw my dedication to cooking, she saw my passion and supported my decision.What sparked your interest in cooking from a young age?As a child, I was drawn to cooking shows on TLC. The glamour of cooking, eating, travelling and the prosperity of famous chefs was fascinating.Around age 16, I discovered Chef Anthony Bourdain’s groundbreaking book, ‘Kitchen Confidential’, which shed light on the reality of the culinary industry. I learned how he became a cultural icon in NYC, reshaping perceptions of chefs.I was also fascinated by chefs like Marco Pierre White, who was a mentor to Gordon Ramsay. Their stories of achieving fame while maintaining discipline intrigued me. But, as I grew older and entered the culinary world, I realised it was far from glamorous—it involved dedication and I am glad I persevered.How did the idea for The Sewing Tin originate?The concept of ‘The Sewing Tin’ came when I realised the stark contrast between the romanticised view of kitchen work and its harsh reality. Witnessing the struggles of many kitchen staff—economic hardships, immigration challenges and language barriers—I had to rediscover my love for cooking.During my internship at ‘Junoon’ restaurant, I met my co-founder, Akhil Upad, who shared my culinary enthusiasm despite his preparations for medical college. Together, we wanted to create a dining experience that was more personal and communal, offering fine dining with a sense of community.We wanted our food to tell stories, so we named our restaurant ‘The Sewing Tin’ inspired by the immigrant experience in NYC. When immigrants opened cookie boxes as kids, they often found sewing supplies instead of food.‘The Sewing Tin’ is like opening a cookie box and finding sewing supplies—something uniquely desi, or South Asian. How do you promote Nepali cuisine in New York City through The Sewing Tin?My partner is from Atlanta with Indian roots, while I come from Nepal, so our menu celebrates and reflects both cultures and heritage.We represent our respective cultures authentically. For example, we have a dish inspired by Newari cuisine called kachaila, similar to French Tartar. We present it as Tartar to make it accessible to our customers but infuse it with Nepali flavours, telling stories about its origins and giving diners a taste of my homeland.What do you think of the prospects of Nepali cuisine abroad?I’m on a mission to share Nepali food worldwide. I have served up dishes like chatamari and lamb sekuwa in my restaurant. But I’m still learning and want to explore more of Nepal’s cuisines. My big dream? To make Nepali cuisine reach more places because it’s got something special that can wow taste buds everywhere.How do you see the changes in restaurants in Nepal?The restaurant industry has deep roots in community and bringing people together, dating back centuries. While this core idea remains, modern restaurants have evolved, making changes to adapt to the times.Yet, in Nepal, despite the growing number of restaurants, many lack uniqueness and storytelling, focusing more on making money than fostering a sense of community.I’ve noticed a troubling trend of rising prices, especially for beloved dishes like momos, which makes people question if they're getting value for their money. It seems like profits are taking precedence over creating genuine, authentic culinary experiences.The industry is starting to lose the creativity and passion that once made it special. It might be time for chefs to shake things up, challenge the norm and bring fresh ideas to the table, revitalising the culinary scene with renewed energy and creativity.What challenges have you faced in New York as an outsider?Living in a bustling city like New York as an outsider has its challenges. But, this city is also full of opportunities for those who are passionate. If you stay true to your culture and want to share your story, opportunities are waiting for you.Even though it can be daunting because of the tough competition, the city appreciates determination and expertise. When I started my journey here, all I wanted to do was cook, eat and share the story of Nepal and its diverse cultures. Instead of focusing on the difficulties, I embraced the chance to follow my passion.What do you think about the criticism of blending Nepali food with modern culinary styles?Chefs care about their food—it’s like they’re sharing a story. They’ve put in a lot of effort to become skilled, so let them be creative. It’s okay to give helpful advice but don’t be mean just to criticise. Chefs shouldn’t also just copy what’s popular, they should cook what they truly love. That’s what makes food special and meaningful.Mishra’s signature dish:Confit Duck Chatamari A traditional Nepali delicacy with French influence.Ingredients:Duck (Legs and breast)Rice (soaked overnight)MayonnaiseWhole spices (cloves, cinnamon, cardamom, bay leaf)Red onionGarlicGingerMula ko achar (Fermented radish)ScallionsLemon juiceNepali pepperVinegarSaltSugarProcedure:For the Duck:Season duck with salt and pepper.Cook in a covered pan with whole spices, garlic, and ginger at low heat for 2 hours on a stove (270 degrees in the oven)Increase heat to crisp up the skin (approximately 15 minutes).Shred the duck meat.Confit Garlic Aioli:Mash cooked garlic and ginger and mix with mayonnaise, lemon juice, Nepali pepper and fermented radishes.Pickled Onions:Slice onions and cook in a mixture of vinegar, water, salt, sugar, and whole spices until softened (about 10 minutes).For the chatamari:Blend soaked rice to make a batter, let it ferment for 6 hours, and adjust consistency with water.Assembling:Cook chatamari batter in duck fat for 4 minutes.Top with shredded duck, aioli, pickled onions and scallions.Serve \nCeleus Baral exudes a serene aura when you meet her, and when she tells you she bakes, it makes sense. Even during a brief encounter, you can tell she has the patience needed to be a baker.“You can eyeball cooking, but baking is chemistry. You have to be meticulous. You cannot rush it, or it does not turn out as expected,” says the 21-year-old environment science student. She also runs the online baking shop Bakeleus. Recently, she has also started selling her baked goods beyond her online shop, with her first stall appearing at The Yellow House’s Night Market. Bakeleus’s menu lists a variety of offerings, including jams, granola, tarts, cakes, cookies, cupcakes and brownies. Baral began baking in 2020, during the lockdown, and launched her online shop last year.She grows much of the produce she incorporates into her baking, and believes we should all understand the origins of our food. “This connection fosters gratitude and a deeper appreciation for nature,” she says. Her background in environmental science, coupled with her affinity for the natural world, imbues her creations with a unique artistic sensibility. Each item she bakes is a testament to her creativity and experimentation, as she believes consistent practice is the key to mastery.Despite the demands of being a full-time student, Baral strives to accommodate orders, typically requiring a minimum of 72 hours' notice for delivery. She is a passionate and discerning individual, evident in the love she infuses into her baking. Additionally, Baral advocates for a zero-waste policy at home, ensuring that every scrap of food and all household items are recycled.Three easy to bake recipes you can try at homeMini carrot cakes Ingredients:38 g milk or yoghurt35 g all-purpose flour1/4 tea spoon ground cinnamon1/8 tea spoon ground gingerA pinch of cardamom1 tea spoon baking powder½ tea spoon fine sea salt2 large eggs, at room temperature27 g granulated sugar13 g brown sugar (or 39 g of regular granulated sugar)1 tea spoon vanilla extract27 g extra virgin olive oil33 g carrots, peeled and shreddedChopped walnutsCandied lemon or orange slices (optional for garnish)Cream cheese frosting56.5 g unsalted butter, softened113.5 g cream cheese, softened1/2 teaspoon vanilla extractA pinch of salt250 g powdered sugarDirections:For the cake:Preheat the oven to 195°C.

The vegetable is relatively cheap and used in almost all cuisines and curries. This ubiquity could perhaps be why someone might be snubbingly called an ‘aloo’ in Nepal, but the reference does not make potatoes less important.Why have them With zero fat, potatoes contain many important nutrients—vitamins B1, B6, Vitamin C, which is an antioxidant, minerals and fibre. Along with starch, it is a good source of potassium, copper, vitamin C, manganese, phosphorus, niacin, dietary fibre and pantothenic acid. Potassium derived from potatoes is an electrolyte that benefits the heart, muscles and nervous system. Potato skin contains fibre, which is important for digestive health.Compared to other vegetables, potatoes are more energy-dense. It is free of fat, gluten, cholesterol and sodium. The relatively cheap plant-based food is also a good source of carbohydrates. Filled with nutrients, one can get a lot of them by consuming potatoes.Sourcing of potatoesPotatoes thrive in diverse climatic conditions. The country cultivates potatoes on around 200,000 hectares of land—from the plains of Tarai to the mountainous region.Every year, Nepal churns out around 3,410,000 tons of the stuff. It also imports potatoes and potato products worth Rs 8.71 billion.“These imports include potato chips, frozen potatoes and fresh potatoes,” said Biswas Poudel, a senior technical officer at the National Potato Research Programme.As its cultivation is possible in diverse landscapes, even climate change does not affect potato farming, experts say. Types of potatoesRed and white potatoes are popular and widely available in the country. Lately, dark potatoes or blue potatoes are gaining popularity.“Red potatoes are highly popular,” said Poudel. “Potatoes that come in colour contain more nutrients. Darker potatoes are packed with antioxidants.”Potatoes that taste sweet are a good source of vitamin A, an important nutrient for immunity and eye health. Purple potatoes are rich in antioxidants, including anthocyanins that may prevent heart disease and cancer and boost brain health.Other benefits As potatoes contain important nutrients, they benefit human health in multiple ways. Iron, phosphorus, calcium, magnesium, and zinc contained in potatoes help the body build and maintain its structure and strength. Consumption of the vegetable that is rich in potassium, calcium and magnesium helps reduce blood pressure naturally. Potatoes also contain a significant amount of fibre, which helps in lowering cholesterol levels in the blood and ultimately lessens the risk of heart disease. Fibre also boosts digestive health.Compared to other green vegetables, farmers use only a minimal amount of pesticides in potatoes, making them safe to eat. Chips and french friesOf late potato chips and french fries are gaining popularity in Nepal. They are also popular dishes in most restaurants and people have even started making french fries at home. Children love potato chips the most. Intake of nutrients and micronutrients, fibre and antioxidants components depends on how potatoes were cooked or prepared for food.Consumption of a lot of chips and french fries can lead to added calories and unhealthy weight gain.“Fibre and antioxidant and other micronutrients of the potatoes may be lost while frying,” said Poudel. “As potatoes are a carbohydrate-rich vegetable, it is not necessary to consume them with rice, which many people do in Nepal.”Experts say diabetic people should limit their potato intake as they cause spikes in blood sugar. \nThe noise of ever-growing traffic, the breaking and mending of black-topped roads, and an ever-expanding concrete jungle are some features that one would associate with the Kathmandu Valley.It is a wildly growing urban forest quickly transforming into a busy metropolis where every inch of space is ready to be sold and built. Yet, pockets of the past remain—small, peaceful neighbourhoods where houses are still made of wood, paths are made of stone tiles, and the stillness of a world that wants to stay intact and immobile. These places are known for tourism, culture, and the restoration of community pride. One such stop is the quiet village of Khokana in southern Lalitpur.Khokana is comparatively close to the mainland urban Lalitpur; from the ring road junction of Bagdole, it takes only a 10-minute drive to reach there. From the airport, you can take a cab directly to Khokana, which will take around half an hour. Get your cameras and hiking boots ready; the area is filled with historical artefacts and hiking trails.However, it is vastly different from the city. It is much nearer to the hills, where stone-paved paths, which could easily be goat trails, are rare in today’s Kathmandu.One such goat trail leads to Sikali temple, a major attraction of the area and accessible only on foot. The pavements are lined with big and small temples on each side, along with ponds that serve as clean water sources and a location for religious rituals. The houses are made of bricks and wood. The concrete invasion, although present, is minimal. Scattered every few hundred metres are small mustard oil mills, co-operative businesses of the locals of Khokana that have existed since medieval times.A site well-recognised for its historical significance, Khokana was even proposed to be made a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1996. Sikali TempleAround an hour’s walk from the historic town, Sikali Temple can be reached, which is also the location for its famed Sikali Jatra.While it can be reached through any public vehicle, a more holistic and adventurous route is to follow the goat trails on the outskirts of Khokana. This route, albeit long, allows for great hiking opportunities, scenic views of the hills surrounding the Kathmandu Valley, and a close-up view of the mediaeval but well-maintained architecture of the local houses.Even if you lose the way, which is very possible, the locals are very welcoming and more than willing to guide you. The main temple itself is three stories tall, and built in the Pagoda style, a common style in many temples in the valley.It is surrounded by a lush grass field which plays the stage to the Sikali Jatra held every year. The temple, like many religious spots around Khokana, is dedicated to the local deity Shree Rudrayani.The Sikali Jatra, a five-day festival that serves as an alternative to Dashain for the Khokana locals, is filled with chariot dances, battle enactments, and storytelling celebrations in the worship of Goddess Rudrayani.Starting from Ghatasthapana in mid to late September, the Jatra is vibrant and an essential experience for every visitor. Historical Khokana townKhokana’s historical town is located around 5 minutes walking distance from the local bus park. The town complex, paved with hand-made stone tiles, is graced with the Indrayanee temple but also has many red-bricked houses built in the local Newari architecture, some of them centuries old.One such house is the ‘Khokana Museum’. Although closed, it is widely popular for being the first house to be lit with electricity in Nepal, as Chandra Shamsher did in 1911.The stand-holder of the first light bulb can still be seen, serving as a historical monument for everyone to see.Similarly, the town complex is also filled with Guthi houses, small ponds, and even the local Ward office. While the Ward office provides a wealth of information for visitors interested in the area’s history, the Guthi halls symbolise the strong community support culture of the locals.The ponds, a notable one present right opposite the Indrayanee temple, have stone taps and remind us of primitive ways of obtaining clean water—a practice many locals are still engaged in.Yet, these ponds are also religious locations, especially used in rituals in the Sikali Jatra.Finally, a stroll through the complex allows visitors to explore old houses and historical artefacts in the serene quietness of Khokana, while the small outlets and Choila places nearby allow you to enjoy the spicy duck or chicken delicacies at the same time.Overall, the historical complex is enough to transport visitors back to a glimpse of the medieval past of the Kathmandu Valley. Mustard oil millsThe most well-known feature of Khokana is its mustard oil mills, which have been operational for hundreds of years and have been using the same methods of preparation since their inception.These mills, scattered throughout Khokana, are often community-owned, and even the ones owned by certain individuals have almost exclusively employed locals.Despite the advent of modern machinery, there is still substantial demand for their products due to the assured guarantee.When I visited one such mill, the local staff informed me that the furnace and oil presser used by them were 300 years old, given by the Patan royalty even before the Shahs became king.In addition to buying pure, organically created mustard oil and pellets, visiting these oil mills offers many educational benefits for international and local tourists alike.Khokana offers visitors a unique glimpse into a preserved bubble of the past through its tranquillity, preservation of ancient lifestyle and cultural elements, and remarkable self-sustenance.  \n“How much oxygen do you have for the summit?”I think this is the kind of question a film producer would ask. But when you're on the mountain, the answer is never clear.I have worked for a long time in the film industry and different art areas, especially photography and engraving.Working in various fields and drawing inspiration from them has become a new normal for me. I have made this approach my way of life without even realising it.I took responsibility for producing the last movie I worked on and shot the behind-the-scenes footage for a documentary. By doing so, I witnessed the entire shooting process and the journey of a movie.In the snowy highlands of Turkey, we had to endure the consequences of the changing climate to shoot ‘About Dry Grasses’, directed by Nuri Bilge Ceylan. The highlands used to be snowy in January, but by the time we got there in the same month, there was no snow. Nature was changing. It was responding to what was happening—to what humanity had done to it. In the end, it snowed, and we shot the intense snow scenes we wanted. But since most of our days were sunny, unlike what the director wanted, we had to shoot in the sunset and sunrise hours. As crew members, we spent many days waiting for the sun to set.Production requires creating opportunities, finding solutions, and being creative for a work of art to come true. For this, patience, endurance, calmness, and timing are necessary. On the other hand, nature wanted us to listen to it and wait for the right time.During that time, I witnessed many of nature's lessons. For example, I experienced extreme cold for the first time. We endured temperatures ranging from -33 degrees to +55 degrees. By listening to nature, surrendering to its forces, and working within its limits, we managed to persevere.No matter how much you prepare or plan during the pre-production phase, if you are working in nature, remember that nature will always have the final say.The film was completed, released, and connected with audiences. Its success at Cannes 2023 was followed by my trip to the North Pole for my project. I returned with a mix of wonderful developments, joys, and challenges. During this process, I experienced life and death, happiness and sadness, losses and awards.I realised the value of being able to breathe comfortably a few days after my father's chemotherapy ended. Just a few days earlier, he had said, \"Well done, my daughter. I'm glad you went!\" All the anxiety and hard work, filled with fears at the beginning, were finally behind me.Before going to Everest, when I was on the verge of giving up, defeated by my fears, I remembered my father's words. Everest reminded me of what he said while struggling to breathe, adding a turning point to my life.What does it mean to say ‘life’s turning point?’ How many turning points can there be in life?Who am I, and what am I doing in this world? How well do I know my own limits? Can I find answers to these big questions? These thoughts sparked my dream of journeying to Everest. Now, after returning, I can say that it turned my life around.“How much oxygen do you need for the summit?” sounds more like “How much do you need to hold on to life?” How many reasons do you find that give meaning to your life, keep you alive, and allow you to breathe? How much can you endure in the face of obstacles, and can you keep believing that a solution will eventually come your way?Can these questions be separated from the idea of measuring and assessing something, from learning its quantity and financial value? Can everything be known with certainty? Should the journey be fully understood in advance, with all its promises laid out? Should it be viewed like a purchase with a price tag, asking, “Is this journey worth this much?”I had never trekked before and had no climbing experience. I had lived at sea level my entire life and had never been to a high altitude.However, this journey was not only about the physical climb but also an inner discovery. After losing my father to lung cancer, his breathing difficulties taught me the fragility of breath, life, and existence. I also mentally prepared myself for the physical challenges I might face. Despite all my concerns, could this journey help me understand the cycle of life and the resilience of the soul?So, how could I make this trek possible? How could I land in Nepal? Despite all the economic difficulties and the many things I felt needed organising, I did my best and believed in it.Since I was embarking on this journey, I felt I should share about my travels and inspire others.Starting with photography, cinema, and engraving, which are already integral parts of my life, I dreamed of documenting and sharing the inspiring aspects of this journey.After months of correspondence and dreaming, it all came true. Finally, I embarked on the journey with the goal of creating photographs, engravings, and documentaries. I learned a great deal from my travels in Nepal, from the people I met, and from every moments I witnessed. I felt incredibly fortunate to have been able to honour my father’s memory with the peace and serenity I experienced in the Himalayas.During my 15-day journey to Everest Base Camp, I encountered nature’s masterpieces at every turn. As concerns like “How will I endure?” and “How will I finish?” started to weigh on me, the mountains suddenly parted with the clouds and gazed down at me.It was amazing to witness the appearance of ‘Gods’ that I had never seen before, in such immense size and in such a close, awe-inspiring manner beside me during that silent walk.As someone who came from one of the most crowded cities in the world, Istanbul, while I struggled with my daily questions and uncertainties, trying to control everything, they stood there calmly, as if answering me.They were just there—before and after.My guide, Lakhpa Sherpa, always reminded me not to worry about how high we were, how long it would take to reach our accommodation, or what the weather would be like. He encouraged me to live in the moment, and he was right.He advised me to focus on my breathing, not to get thirsty, to eat enough, and to appreciate the extraordinary beauty of the journey. In the mountains, plans dissolve and each moment is embraced as it comes.All the good wishes, prayers, and everything encountered along the way were for the journey itself. The mountain was full of life, secrets, and everything I had wondered about.This 15-day journey to Everest Base Camp was a solo adventure, yet I wouldn't have been able to complete it without my guide, Lhakpa, and my porter. Additionally, I was fortunate enough to experience the hospitality, generosity, and honesty at Trekkers Paradise, which organised the entire journey and provided guidance.I witnessed how dedication and sincerity are crucial in completing a journey safely and healthily. Ghanshyam Sharma, from Trekkers Paradise and Sauraj Jhingan, a climber who summited the Everest in 2018, shared their experiences with me during the journey.They experienced the 2015 earthquake while they were at the Everest Base Camp.As a filmmaker, their role as actors, and attention to detail played a significant role in bringing my dream photography and documentary project to life.The sponsors of my journey were Turkish Airlines, The North Face, Apple, Canon, and Stanley. My supporters include Oscar International College and Nepal Film Campus. Throughout the journey, I shared many experiences, memories, and countless photos and images with my students.On my way back home after 21 days, I celebrated my birthday on the plane. From the right window, the Himalayas bid me farewell. I felt like I had opened a new chapter in my life, and I was certain that I would return.I had made many friends and memories in Nepal.For now, I will be working on a documentary and preparing for a photography and engraving exhibition titled ‘My Soul Beyond the Mountain’.To the Himalayas: This summer was spent with you, but we will meet again soon. \nWe spent five days in Sri Lanka two weeks ago, driving up and down the island, covering almost 70 percent of its territory. Our tour spanned over 1,000 kilometres, including hills, beach spots, and heritage and religious sites.Our first stop in Sri Lanka was Colombo’s Bandaranaike International Airport. We were greeted by a warm and humid breeze when we exited the airport. The host briefed us (a group of journalists) that heavy rainfall has affected areas across Sri Lanka since mid-May 2024. Rain and storms intensified on June 1, with the most significant effects in the south and west of the country. We were lucky to have no rain in the forecast.On the first night, we checked into the lavish Jetwing Lake resort, an opulent sanctuary amidst the lush landscape. The resort’s expansive grounds were a retreat, offering a glimpse of Sri Lanka's natural beauty. We feasted on delicious cuisine, every bite exploding with flavour, introducing us to the island’s famed culinary delights. On June 7, early morning, the sun shone brightly, previewing the promise of an incredible journey ahead. We set off early the following day, eager to explore the mysteries of this enchanting island. As we ventured further into the heart of Sri Lanka, the landscape revealed its majestic nature. We were astounded by seeing Pidurangala Rock, a 200-metre-high granite colossus just a kilometre north of Sigiriya. The short hike to Pidurangala Rock offered breathtaking views of Sigiriya and beyond. We climbed the steep steps and soon were rewarded with a breathtaking panoramic view of the surrounding landscape. It took us 30 minutes to climb. The sight took our breaths away and left us humbled in the presence of such grandeur. From the top are glorious vistas of the surrounding landscape and an incredible view of the majestic Sigiriya Rock. From there, Sigiriya Lion’s Rock is visible, standing alone. This was the place where demon king Ravana had his palace in the Treta Yuga. Believed to have been built 50 centuries ago, the palace is said to have had a unique lift for Ravana and his visitors. Ravana imprisoned Sita in one of the caves at the bottom of this humongous boulder. Sigiriya is a fifth-century fortress in Sri Lanka carved out of an inselberg, a hill of hard volcanic rock that soared high above the surrounding jungle. We spent two hours atop the rock, mainly taking photographs. We descended from Pidurangala Rock, filled with awe and a sense of accomplishment.The journey ahead seemed even more enticing as we ventured along the winding roads, heading towards our next destination.Cash-strapped Sri Lanka plunged into its worst financial crisis in more than seven decades in 2022, with a severe dollar shortage sending inflation soaring to a high of 70 percent, its currency to record lows, and its economy contracting 7.3 percent.Thanks to the growing number of tourists, Sri Lanka is now bouncing back.In Jetwing Lake, we met Kasun Pradeep Somasiri, a receptionist. He briefed us that the resort is now 50 percent occupied. “That’s a better figure now as we are recovering.”The travel and tourism sector is a significant income generator for Sri Lanka. However, the economic crisis, the Ukraine–Russia war, and China’s zero-Covid policy have jeopardised the industry.Tourism accounted for more than 12 percent of the country’s GDP in 2019 and was the third-largest source of foreign exchange reserves, behind worker remittances and the apparel industry.Sri Lanka was poised to be one of the world’s best holiday destinations due to its rich culture, wealth of natural resources, and diversity of accessible experiences.However, tourism-dependent Sri Lanka suffered its first major setback with the Easter bombings 2019. This led to the collapse of inbound tourism flows as international arrivals declined by 18 percent year-on-year, and tourist expenditure fell by 17.7 percent that year. This was immediately followed by two years of pandemic restrictions. Inbound visitors fell to just 116,600 in 2021.An acute balance of payments crisis forced Sri Lanka to preemptively default on foreign debt of over $50 billion in April 2022, triggering a crippling economic contraction with spiralling inflation.“Tourism is gaining momentum,” says Somasiri. “The British and Chinese have started to return to Sri Lanka.”January-August is the peak season for foreigners. “From December to April, local people travel for holiday purposes,” says Somasiri. Before we started the tour to other religious sites, our tour guide, Sampath Mayadunne, told us, “Don't take selfies with your back to Buddha.” Turning your back on a Buddha statue and some other religious sites to take photos and videos is a strict no-no.The most common sight across Sri Lanka is the tank cascades system, an ancient irrigation infrastructure. The system is a network of small tanks draining to large reservoirs that store rainwater and surface runoff for later use.“These infrastructures were built by its ancient kings over 2,000 years ago to solve the water scarcity in the country’s dry zone,” says Mayadunne.On day two, we travelled to Ranweli Spice Garden in Matale. This garden is famous for its rare spices and herbs. A tour of the gardens will show you the cultivation, harvesting, cleaning, and packaging process, as well as the health benefits and uses of the herbs.On the way, we saw a colourful Muthumariamman Hindu temple, boasting hundreds of detailed sculptures in a rich mosaic of colour.In Kandy, we visited the Temple of the Tooth Relic (Sri Dalada Maligawa), one of the most sacred places of worship in the Buddhist world. It was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1988.The temple sustained damage from bombings by Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna in 1989 and by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam in 1998. However, it was fully restored each time.We then headed to Jetwing St Andrew’s, a luxurious 5-star property in Sri Lanka’s hill country of Nuwara Eliya, situated at 1,900 metres above sea level. During our stay in Kandy, we immersed ourselves in the city's charm and the serenity of the countryside. On the third day, early morning, we travelled to Nuwara Eliya, the area famous for tea estates that give many Nepalis the feeling that they have come to Kanyam, Ilam, in eastern Nepal.We visited a tea factory called Damro Labookellie Tea Centre, the oldest tea centre in Sri Lanka. Due to its cold climate, it is the most important area for tea production in Sri Lanka.In this tea factory, they make white and black tea, while the green tea is processed in another tea factory and then sent to Damro.After the tea factory tour and the tea tasting, we headed to Galle, our next resting point.We encountered narrow, winding, and maze-like streets and alleys in Nuwara Eliya, known as ‘Little England’. The town has preserved almost all its British-era buildings and is calm and beautiful. On our way to Galle, at the roadside, our tour guide stopped us at the famed Sita temple, which has Hanuman's footprints and is the place where Sita, wife of Lord Rama, was held captive by the demon king Ravana after he abducted her from India.We were at Sita Eliya, a temple named Sri Seethai Amman.When we reached the Hindu temple, rich in vibrant colours and architectural elements, it was full of devotees. The water stream adjoining the temple is believed to be where Sita bathed. Large footprints are found on the stones in the stream, and there is a saying that those belong to Hanuman, who came spying to find Sita’s whereabouts.In Ella, Ravana’s waterfalls are significant in the Rama-Ravana story. The cascade charms visitors from all over the globe. The waterfall is easily accessible and is known to have hidden caves at the top, which are believed to have been used as Ravana's residence.The 25-metre-tall waterfall is a beautiful cascade that provides the perfect backdrop for a photo to remember your Ramayana trail adventures in Sri Lanka. A short pilgrimage tour ended there, and it was now time for an adventure. Though it was not part of our itinerary, our guide decided to tour us on a train ride.Though short, only six kilometres from Ella to Demodera, it was thrilling. Everyone screamed in unison like kids on a fair ride to hear the echoes in the dark every time we passed through the tunnels. The sound of the train is subtly different inside a tunnel. For the first-timer, the darkness and shouts inside the tunnels when the train passes would be scary, like a horror movie.The train we boarded wasn’t crowded, but people had already filled the doorway, ready for the scenic journey.With the shrill sound of a whistle, the train slowly pulled away from the platform at Ella, passing houses, coconut trees and green fields.As the train progressed, tourists and locals were leaning out the windows and crowding to hang out the doors. I joined the crowd and hung out on a train. A short excitement ended there.After lunch, we headed to Galle and reached Jetwing Lighthouse. As soon as our group entered the hotel, they shouted with excitement.The hotel is on a rocky outcrop three miles west of Galle. Waves crash over giant boulders in front of it and produce howling winds.We were at Galle’s 17th-century fort five minutes from the hotel on day four. In the Bay of Galle on the southwest coast of Sri Lanka, Galle Fort was built first in 1588 by the Portuguese and lavishly rebuilt by the Dutch during the 17th century. It is a historical, archaeological and architectural heritage monument that maintains a perfect appearance even after more than 436 years.We then reached Hikkaduwa Beach, a popular beach destination on the southern coast of Sri Lanka. On the way, we saw a 30-metre-high Big Buddha Statue. It is a replica of the 6th-century Buddhas of Bamiyan destroyed by the Taliban in Afghanistan. It was created using the earliest known sketches of the statue. It was built in remembrance of the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami victims.We then travelled through the 222-kilometre-long Southern Expressway, Sri Lanka's first expressway linking the capital, Colombo, with Galle, Matara, and Hambantota, significant cities south of the island.On day five, we reached Colombo, the capital of Sri Lanka. Jetwing Colombo Seven hosted us in the bustling capital. We took a city tour early morning and visited Bally's Casino at night.On day six, we returned to Kathmandu early in the morning on a Sri Lankan Airlines flight, the airline that organised the trip in coordination with Jetwing Hotels Limited, a Sri Lankan hotel chain.National flag carrier Nepal Airlines, in its previous avatar as Royal Nepal Airlines, used to operate direct flights to Colombo during the 1980s. However, the carrier suspended operations following an armed movement by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) in Sri Lanka. There had been no direct air links between the two countries for decades.In 2016, Himalaya Airlines started a chartered flight that lasted a few months due to low traffic movement between the two countries. Sri Lankan Airlines started operating direct flights to Kathmandu in August 2021.“The main objective of this media tour is to increase tourism in both countries for mutual benefit. We want to draw Nepalis for pilgrims and leisure activities,” says Nilina Pathirana, Country Manager at Srilankan Airlines in Nepal.“We have understood that Nepali travellers tend to travel to Bangkok, Vietnam, Malaysia, Dubai, and Maldives. Nepalis have quite minimal knowledge about Sri Lanka and the religious connection between Lanka and Nepal. We want to promote Nepal and Sri Lanka jointly. This will be a win-win business,” added Pathirana.The airline said it currently carries 60 percent of the passengers from Nepal to Sri Lanka and beyond destinations like Tokyo, Sydney, Melbourne, and other Middle Eastern destinations. The return airfare for a 3.5-hour-long flight starts at Rs74,000. “We have a four-night, five-day package that begins from Rs80,000, depending on the properties and extended itineraries,” says Pathirana.Nepalis must submit certain required documents for visa processing, like their passport copy and bank statement. Due to this government-to-government policy, only Nepalis must obtain a prior visa. Otherwise, Sri Lankans are required to have a visa upon arrival.“The other best thing is that Sri Lankan Airlines can be involved with the visa process or facilitate the Nepalis tourists. Our main intention is to have a sustainable market in Kathmandu and make it a daily flight,” says Pathirana. \nMundhum Trek in Koshi province in the eastern part of Nepal is a new cultural walking trail. It passes through several indigenous ethnic villages and landscapes in Khotang and Bhojpur districts. This trail goes up to an elevation of 4,200 metres to the viewpoint of Silchung Peak and takes one through the settlements of the Kirati people. This route starts from Diktel Bazaar and passes through beautiful settlements like Chakhewa, Rawa Dhap, Salpa Bhanjyang, Silchung and Hanspokhari before ending in Bhojpur. There are some hotels in Diktel but trekkers are advised to carry tents. The trail offers panoramic views of most of the eight-thousanders, including Everest, Lhotse, Makalu, Cho Oyu and Kanchenjunga mountains. The spring season, March through May, is highly recommended for the trek.Janaki Mandir Janaki Mandir at Janakpur in Madhesh province was constructed in 1874 and is a blend of Mughal and local architecture. The temple is a three-storey building and has 60 rooms, making it the largest temple in Nepal. Pilgrims flock here by the thousands to pay homage to Janaki Mandir—Janaki being the other name of Sita, the daughter of King Janak. The temple houses an idol of Sita which was found near Ayodhya, the kingdom of Ram. The marriage anniversary of Lord Ram and Sita is celebrated in Janakpur every year on Vivaha Panchami, which falls in December. In the southwest corner of Janaki Mandir is the Vivaha Mandap, which has been built at the site where the marriage of Ram and Sita is said to have taken place. Another well-known temple in the vicinity is Ram Mandir, which is built in pagoda style and is hence different from the other temples in Janakpur that generally bear resemblance to Mughal architecture. It houses a female statue, said to be of Yogamaya, which has the reputation of being one of the most beautiful images of female forms in Nepal. Other holy sites of interest include the Laxman Temple, Sankat Mochan Temple and Hanuman Temple.Kuri Village, Kalinchok Kuri village, a popular tourist destination around 150 km from Kathmandu, lies at an altitude of 3,842 metres above sea level in Kalinchowk of Dolakha district, in Bagmati province. People visit the place to enjoy the snow during the winter besides the mesmerising landscapes and splendid panoramic view of the Himalayan range. Kalinchok gets snow mainly at the end of December and the snowfall continues till the end of February or mid-March. When there is snow, it is difficult for jeeps, buses and cars to reach the top of Kuri village. Chains are wrapped around the wheels of vehicles and specially modified jeeps with highly experienced drivers are used to carry visitors. There are several hotels and restaurants in the area. The road up to Kuri has also improved over the years.Annapurna Base Camp Annapurna Base Camp trek, in Gandaki province, makes for a picturesque journey that takes you to the foothills of the Annapurna South, up to 4,130 metres above sea level. The five-day trek (seven days for slow walkers) offers rich cultural diversities, typical Nepali villages and the flora and fauna nestled at the foothills of Annapurna. The distance from Pokhara to Annapurna Base Camp is approximately 81 kilometres. It is among the shortest and most budget-friendly treks in Nepal. For Nepalis, lodging costs around $5 to $10 per day. For foreigners, the overall cost of the trek ranges from $800 to $1500 on average per person. Annapurna Base Camp trek can be done at any time throughout the year as each season offers a different trekking experience. The ideal time for the trek depends on your weather preferences and what you expect from it. However, autumn (September to October) and spring (March to May) are considered the two best seasons for the trek, as the days at the time are warm and bright with clear skies.Bardiya National Park Bardiya National Park, located in the southern Tarai belt of Lumbini province, is home to one of the most elusive and majestic animals on earth—the Royal Bengal Tiger. The park, which covers an area of 968 square kilometres, is considered one of the most important protected areas in the country. It is a prime destination for those looking to catch a glimpse of a tiger. A bit of luck and patience will offer a good chance to see the Bengal Tiger. The jungle safari also offers one the opportunity to spot Asian elephants and the greater one-horned rhinoceros. The rare Gangetic river dolphins are occasionally spotted on rafting trips along the Geruwa River, the eastern channel of the Karnali river. Besides, visitors can enjoy the homestays and explore local Tharu culture. The right time to visit the park is from mid-September to mid-December and mid-February to May.Khaptad National Park Khaptad National Park in Sudurpaschim province is a protected area in the far western region. It stretches over four districts of Bajhang, Bajura, Achham and Doti and ranges in elevation from 1,400 to 3,300 metres. The park can be visited throughout the year. Trekkers are advised to bring their tents, food and other supplies. The Nepal Tourism Board says of late, social media has been increasingly influencing Nepali travellers to go to Khaptad. Since the far-flung Khaptad National Park is still offbeat for many travellers, the area remains pristine and fresh. The seasons of spring (March-May) and autumn (October-November) are the ideal times to visit the park. The temperature ranges from 10°c to 20°c offering pleasant trekking weather. The monsoon begins in June and lasts until September and during this time, roads often become muddy and slippery. From December to February, winter brings snow and chilling winds to the park.Limi Valley \nOnce again, my heart swelled with joy when my hometown came into view.Arriving at Lalikharka after the treacherous journey through Pauwa Bhanjyang and the bustling Kanchhi Dokan, Phidim, the headquarters of Panchthar district, revealed itself like a surprise gift. My home town, Phidim, is unique in the fact that it reveals to travellers approaching it from uphill. As the vehicle descends the mountain road, it slowly comes into view, its houses and buildings recognisable for the native son.This Dashain, I undertook the much-awaited trip to my hometown with my wife Kabita and daughter Aarohi. Little did I anticipate the transformation that awaited me.The moment I got out of the jeep, I noticed that Phidim, nestled in the lush hills, has undergone a remarkable transformation over the years. As I guided my family to my home, which had suffered damages in the 1989 quake that struck eastern Nepal, I found that old, mud and stone houses had been replaced by concrete buildings. The place was vastly different from the one I remembered.Arriving at my childhood home felt like reuniting with an old friend. Navigating its nooks and crannies with my daughter, we delved into the history of the house, a symbol of my cherished memories.My wife had visited Phidim years ago, spending a month with my parents. She, too, recalled beautiful moments she had had in the town. I asked the tenant about the neighbours and acquaintances. Some had died, while others had left for good.A call to local journalist Giriraj Banskota led me to the school grounds, where memories flooded back. This was where I spent my teenage years, playing ball, learning to kick, and watching major tournaments. Here, I even encountered a group of Western climbers headed to Kanchenjunga, the world’s third-highest mountain. I remember being awed by their shiny yellow tents, headlights and strange smell. I remember practising my tutephuteko Angrezi with the climbers. Birendra Shield, an annual sports tournament named after the late king, brought ace players from various schools in Panchthar district. The district also hosted Yuba Mela, an annual three-day fair to commemorate the birthday of the king, organising football tournaments in which teams from as far as Sunsari and Taplejung participated. I never excelled at dribbling balls. A boy growing up in a seven-member family, I soon found my interest in literature. In the late 1980s, Phidim hosted a major literary festival. In the run-up to the 1990 pro-democracy protest, walls were painted with anti-monarchy slogans, local politicians were arrested. I took my family to my school, Naya Namuna Secondary School. It was Saturday, so the school was closed. I peeked through the steel gate and wall, imagining myself labouring over classes. Memories are hazy, but what I remember most is going out of the school—to quiz contests with me leading the school team, to essay competitions at the District Education Office and to play carom board, a national pastime, in a nearby shopfront. Returning to the main street, the demolition of a landmark gate made me reflect on how cities transform, shedding old landmarks for new identities. Navigating narrow alleyways, I felt like a stranger in my own hometown. Multistory buildings have emerged and roads have been paved, reshaping the town. It’s the same place with a different face, leaving me nostalgic for the Phidim of my memories.We finally reached Shivalaya temple, which I told my wife and daughter was one of my cherished hangouts. A giant statue of Falgunanda (the Kirant leader’s birthday is celebrated on November 10) stood before the steps to the temple. Though my wife suspected I came here to smoke, in reality, I visited the temple in the evening to meet friends and talk about issues that mattered most to us at the time. It also offered a panoramic view of the town (I could not take my family to Gadhi Danda, a hillock across the Shivalaya).Towards the end of my journey, I felt sad about Phidim’s lack of prospects. To my dismay, I found that people have been leaving the town in droves. Despite blacktopped roads and multi-story buildings, Phidim faces a troubling reality. The lack of quality higher education and specialist healthcare has driven people away, echoing the circumstances that led me to Kathmandu years ago. Conversations with locals confirmed a mass exodus from the town, a trend that raises concerns about Phidim's future.My conversations with familiar strangers led me to conclude that Phidim has transformed into a transit town for pilgrims heading to Pathibhara Devi Temple, which is around 255 kilometres north in Taplejung district. I met dozens of people headed to the holy site. While pilgrims see it as a stopover, for me, it was a homecoming. The realisation dawned that Phidim is, perhaps, in a state of transition, trading its rustic charm for the hallmarks of urbanisation. While I left Phidim for higher education in Kathmandu, people from rural areas have flocked to the town in search of better opportunities, bringing life and energy to the once quiet community.As we bid adieu to my hometown, I couldn’t help but reflect on the inevitability of leaving a place, no matter how enamoured one is with it. Passing Kanchhi Dokan, I pointed out Kanchnajungha and Kumbhakarna to my daughter—symbols of my childhood. Phidim, now a blend of nostalgia and change, remains etched in my heart, a testament to the intricate dance between memory and evolution. \nNepal national women’s cricket team defeated Sri Lanka Women Development Squad by two runs in their third T20 practice match in Surrey Village in Maggona on Tuesday.Indu Barma’s team bundled out Sri Lanka Women Development Squad, who were chasing 113, for 110 in 19.5 overs, with Kabita Joshi taking 3-16 and Kritika Marasini returning the match figures of 2-16.The win also prevented the host team from sweeping the three-match series. Nepal had lost the first T20 warm up game by 33 runs and the second by four wickets.Balasuriya top scored for Sri Lanka Development Squad with 38 runs off 36 balls, while Nethranjali made 26 facing 20 deliveries. Sri Lanka collapsed early when Kabita Kunwar trapped opener Karindi leg in front in the third over and Chhetri ran out Wijesinghe in the fourth over. Balasuriya steadied the ship, and with support from Nethranjali, the host team looked destined for another victory.But once Joshi dismissed Balasuriya in the 16th over and Nethranjali in the 18th, the Lankans’ hopes of completing a clean sweep faded.Skipper Barma also took a wicket.Earlier, Nepal posted 112-6 from 20 overs after choosing to bat first, thanks to Rubina Chhetri who revived Nepal’s innings after suddenly collapsing in the eighth over.Samjhana Khadka (10 off 20) and Sita Rana Magar (15 off 23) added 31 runs for the opening wicket to give Nepal a good start. Nepal found themselves in big trouble at 33-3 when they lost three quick wickets, including both openers, to Thennakone (2-21) in the eighth over.Bindu Rawal and Barma offered some resistance but the skipper too fell in the 13th over that left Nepal reeling at 52-4.But Chhetri partnered with Rawal to defy the Sri Lankan bowlers and guided Nepal past 100. Chhetri hit 37 runs off 26 balls, while Rawal contributed 20 off 31 balls.The victory will be a huge boost for Nepal ahead of their ACC Women’s T20 Asia Cup, which is set to begin on July 19.Nepal have been drawn in a tough group alongside the tournament’s most successful side and defending champions India, two-time runners up Pakistan and the United Arab Emirates.Nepal, who are still looking to register their first win at the biennial competition, will open their Asia Cup against the United Arab Emirates on Friday.

He also knows that eight of them have been deported from the country and that they have lost a cumulative Rs45 million in the process. The deported youths say that they returned home empty-handed after facing unspeakable ordeals and lost Rs6 million each on average.The Tak village in Rukum East—a close-knit settlement of 425 houses—was considered the Maoists’ ‘base area’ during the insurgency. Village youths who reached the US through illegal routes and got deported have lost an estimated Rs40 million. The number of those who returned without completing the journey and the amount they lost remain unknown.To get to the US, the youths have taken loans at up to 36 percent interest per annum from their relatives and village landowners. In Tak village, at least one person each from half of the households has gone abroad, Budha said. “Youths started going to America about six-seven years ago,” he said. “If they could gather enough money, the whole village would try to go to the US.” Budha’s own son had reached the US illegally in 2017, spending Rs3.2 million.During the insurgency, outsize slogans of revolution would adorn the walls of houses in the village. Hoping for a better life, people from all walks of life helped out the Maoists. But now, village youths are paying the agents to illegally get to the US—a country that the Maoists used to call their ‘enemy’, an ‘imperialistic force’. This has cost the Tak village much and in multiple ways.Death of a dreamSome of the deported youths have chosen to flee the village altogether, burdened with debt and creditors’ pressure. At least five such families have already left, said a resident. The family of Ram Budha was one of them. On April 28, 2015, Ram, who had returned to Nepal after working in Malaysia for eight years, took the illegal route to the US. He travelled through arduous trails for months and finally arrived in the country. Upon reaching the country, he was detained and had to stay at the detention camp for 27 months. When his refugee application was rejected, he was deported to Nepal in mid-December 2019. He lost Rs4.5 million in the process. He now owes over Rs6 million to creditors. “After the creditors began to put pressure on me, I couldn’t live in the village peacefully,” said Ram, who currently runs a vegetable farm in Tarakeshwar, Kathmandu.While those who got to the US through illegal routes and fortunately got refugee status there narrate their stories with pride, those who have been deported or returned from half-way have tragic tales to tell.Nanda Kala Gharti, who lives in a small stone house on the upper flank of Tak village, spends her days in melancholy. Her husband, Dhanlal, had chosen to take the illegal route to the US, and Nanda Kala, a mother of four, is living with the repercussions of his decision. Dhanlal had got into the US after a six-month long arduous journey and was detained immediately. He had to spend four years in the detention camp, before he was deported to Nepal. He had already lost Rs6 million.Nanda Kala said they now have an insurmountable crisis in their hands. Pointing to her son, she exclaimed, “When will he grow up, go abroad and pay back the loans!”Dhanlal himself tried to go to Croatia once and spent 15 days in Kathmandu for the process. But after he was turned down, he returned home dejected. “Now we will submit the passport to another agent [for Dhanlal’s trip abroad],” Nanda Kala said. “There’s no point staying here.”Stories that echo each otherThe situation in Sisne Rural Municipality is similar to that of Putha Uttarganga. Here, one can hear plenty of stories of those who have tried to go to the US and those who are fighting refugee cases there. Krishna Regmi, chair of the rural municipality, personally knows seven people who have been deported from the US.Gangaram Khadka, a resident of Sisne-3, runs a bee and chicken farm. Like other young men in his village, Khadka had headed off to the US via an illegal route on 27 March, 2018. He had reached the US via the New Delhi-Moscow-Barcelona-Bogota-Panama-Costa Rica-Nicaragua-Honduras-Guatemala-Mexico route. When he finally arrived in the US, he was detained and had to spend 11 months in detention. He was deported on 15 March, 2019. He had handed over Rs3.2 millions to the agent and spent Rs2 million to fight the case to become a refugee. “It’s not possible for me to pay back the loan while working in Nepal,” he said. “I aim to pay back some interest and head off abroad again.”For six months after Khadka was deported, he had anxiety and headache, he said, adding the three people from his village who were deported like him are also struggling with their mental health.Tikaram Pun, a 40-year-old resident of Bohora village in Musikot-4, is also haunted by his past journey. In September 2017, he reached the US after crossing 17 countries with the help of organised human traffickers. Of the 41 people in his group, 31 were from Rukum East and Rukum West, he said. Pun, who was detained on arrival in the US, spent 24 months in a detention camp. His refugee application was also refused and so he was deported along with eight other Nepalis. “When I returned, I started having mental health problems. I still suffer from them,” he said. Pun is under pressure from creditors and relatives to pay back the Rs9.2 million loan he had taken for the task.Those who died on the wayA group of 10 Bangladeshis and seven Nepalis, including Rupak Bohora of Bafikot-3 in Rukum West, were on a mission to reach Costa Rica through Colombia, Caribbean Coast, Capuragana and Panama. But while they were crossing a sea, their boat capsized. As many as 12 died in the incident, including six Nepalis. Rupak’s wife, Geeta, learned about the incident only after six days, on 25 June, 2021.“I still don’t know what exactly happened,” said Geeta, who had been married off at age 19 and is now a mother of two daughters. The only thing she knows is that Rupak has died and she is now all alone. And that she has Rs5 million in loan taken for Rupak’s trip. She showed a picture of her husband on her phone to this scribe and said, “I only have memories.”Lack of political will and legal remediesThe concrete bridge over Chewang river is on the edge of Tak village. On the walls of the bridge are paintings of political theorists like Marx, Engels, Lenin, Stalin and Mao, and the iconic slogan, ‘Workers of the world, unite!’, below them. But the slogan appears to be at odds with life in the village. Given the phenomenon of illegal travels to the US through the help of organised human traffickers, the whole village appears to be emptying. Neither the local governments are concerned about the phenomenon nor are the political parties paying attention.Puniraj Gharti, chair of Putha Uttarganga Rural Municipality, said though the trend is worrying, there’s nothing he can do. “How could we stop them from making the trip when they are struggling to make a living in the village?” he said.Krishna Regmi, chair of Sisne Rural Municipality, said that the vicious cycle of poverty started after marijuana farming was banned in the country. Then the Maoist insurgency added to the woe, forcing youths to migrate. The signing of the peace agreement in 2006 didn’t herald any change in the economy either and youths are struggling to get jobs. Organised human traffickers are cashing in on this sorry state of affairs, Regmi said. “Meter byajis [usurious lenders] are also promoting this phenomenon,” he added.The phenomenon is equally rife in Dang’s Tulsipur and Ghorahi. Ramesh Kumar Pandey, chair of Ghorai-15, says that even though many heading to the US are swindled, no complaints are filed at the ward office. “Only those who attempt to go to Saudi Arabia or Qatar file the complaints,” he said.One can infer from Pandey’s statements that the families of such illegal travellers don’t want to publicise the ordeals of their family members. On the one hand, agents threaten them to not publicise the issue; on the other, they fear they themselves would be punished by law.According to the Anti-Human Trafficking Bureau, as many as 178 Nepalis, including 174 men, have been deported from the US in the five fiscal years after 2018-19. Of them, the highest 49 are from Rukum while 37 are from Dang. The data doesn’t include those who returned after making it to the half-way or those who have been fighting the legal battle in the US for refugee status. But this data is enough to show that many such youths are from the ‘base areas’ of the Maoist insurgency.SSP Jeevan Shrestha, chief of the bureau, said that data on the number of such victims and the amounts they have spent is hard to collect since complaints are rarely filed with the police. “This is human trafficking but for a lack of law, we are still compelled to launch the cases as per Human Trafficking and Transportation (Control) Act 2074 BS,” Shrestha said. “The Act provides a maximum penalty of Rs250,000 for the offenders and 50 percent of that as compensation to the victims.” Without specific law, police also invoke the theft and organised crime act to punish the offenders, he added.On the one hand, police receive no complaints; on the other, the phenomenon sees no control.Bhaskar Gautam, a political scientist, says the rise in cases of human trafficking in the insurgency’s ‘base areas’ is due to the political system’s abject failure.While the Maoists raised issues related to livelihood, nationalism and a new kind of democracy to fuel their war machine, after the peace process, it is livelihoods that have been hit the hardest, Gautam said. “The traditional way of life and economy took a hit during the insurgency,” he said. “Developments after the peace process also failed to address that. What sprang up was organised human trafficking.”(Mahesh KC in Rukum East and Durgalal KC in Dang contributed to this report.)This report is prepared in collaboration with the Center for Investigative Journalism-Nepal. \nGyanumaya BK had been suffering from severe backaches for a while. The resident of Pokhara-15, BK visited the Metrocity Hospital in Srijanachowk seeking treatment five months ago. The 69-year-old, who works as a labourer, has already spent over Rs50,000 on follow-up checkups and medications.BK spent eight days in the hospital in January and has been paying off loans she had taken to pay her bills and for follow-up visits to the hospital. Had BK been aware of the Health Facility Operation Standards-2020, which private hospitals must adhere to, she wouldn’t have had to borrow money to pay her medical bills. As per the regulations, hospitals must set aside 10 percent of their total beds to the underprivileged and needy.“I didn’t know hospitals were required to provide free treatment to those who can’t afford hospital stays,” BK said. “But even if I did, I would have to fight to get the service as the hospital won’t willingly offer me the service.”The Pokhara-based 50-bed hospital’s Chief Executive Officer Gyan Prasad Aryal admits that his hospital does not adhere to the mandate. “We don’t have explicit information from the health ministry on the Health Facility Operation Standards-2020,” said Aryal. “Moving forward, we will follow the instructions.” The hospital authorities say they give a 10-15 percent discount on the final hospital bill as opposed to dedicating 10 percent of their beds and free treatment and medications to the less privileged. Hospitals with 15 beds come under the jurisdiction of the local units while those with up to 50 beds fall under the ambit of the Provincial Health Directorate. Likewise, the Provincial Health Ministry oversees health facilities with over 50 beds.However, no regulatory body has data on whether health facilities are following government rules, especially Health Facility Operation Standards-2020. But it is an open secret that most private hospitals in Pokhara are not following the regulations.Pokhara Municipality Health Department Officer Yadunath Baral, Kaski District Health Officer Bhim Prasad Poudel, and Province Health Director Khim Bahadur Khadka all admit that local hospitals disregard the regulations. “Our monitoring and inspection is also lax, that’s why most hospitals ignore the rules,” he said. He says lack of manpower hampers effective inspection. “Our manpower is enough to conduct inspections in other districts, but not in Kaski, which has many private hospitals,” he said. “We need more people for that”. According to Baral, although the hospitals claim to offer a certain discount on final bills to the needy, they are unable to show the record of the discounts provided. “The hospitals claim they give discounts, but most hospitals have not even been able to show us the proof,” said Khadka. “Legal actions should be taken against the hospitals that fail to submit a monthly report on the free services for the poor. More importantly, they must be liable for flouting government standards that aim to benefit the poor.” The Provincial Health Directorate also does not have any data on the directive’s implementation at hospitals with more than 50 beds.The department’s chief of health services Dr Ramesh KC says that they have been working on updating information of health services in the Gandaki region. “Hospitals have failed to submit their mandatory monthly reports. We will seek that information when they come for new permits or permit renewal,” KC said. There are 27 privately-owned hospitals within the Pokhara Metropolitan City and 39 in the Gandaki region. Bharatpur Metropolitan City in Chitwan in Bagmati Province is also called the ‘medical city’  as it is home to 23 private hospitals with a total of 1,200 beds. Additionally, there are multiple large-scale government hospitals and two medical colleges—Chitwan Medical College and College of Medical Sciences—that also provide medical services. Had the Health Facility Operation Standards-2020 been followed by the 23 private hospitals, 120 patients would have received free health services every year, according to Durgadutta Chapagain, chief of the Chitwan Health Office.“Although the hospitals claim they provide the services, none have been able to provide convincing proof. Instead, we found them giving such discounts to patients who are close to hospital operators,” said Chapagain. “Our department validates the permits for new health facilities and re-registrations for hospitals with a 25-bed capacity. We have asked such public health service providers to put up posters or stickers reading ‘Discounts for the needy’ on the hospital premises so that patients know what services they can get on discount.”Meanwhile, Bikram Adhikari, Secretary of the Private Hospitals Coordination Committee in Chitwan, claims that the regulations are impractical. “There are a few services that hospitals can provide free of cost. You cannot expect hospitals to provide all services for free. That’s why there is a need to amend the existing regulations,” said Adhikari.The monitoring bodies’ inaction and lackadaisical approach to ensuring that public health services are accessible and affordable to all makes private hospitals blatantly ignore government mandates.Bharatpur Metropolitan City’s Deputy Mayor Chitrasen Adhikari says that although the metropolis is aware that private hospitals must allocate 10 percent of their beds for free treatment of poor people, the metropolis administration has yet to devise a monitoring mechanism. “We have not taken any steps towards that end, but we will soon,” he said.Just like Pokhara and Chitwan, Biratnagar is also plagued with the same problem. There are 32 private hospitals currently in operation in the metropolis. Deepak Bhattarai, statistical officer at the municipality’s health office, asserts that none of the health facilities met the set requirements. A monthly report submitted by the Biratnagar-based Nobel Medical College and Teaching Hospital, which has 750 beds, stated that the hospital had provided the said concession to more than 400 patients. “However, the report did not clarify how many of the 400 patients were provided free hospital beds and the services that come along with the beds, and how many were given discounts on their hospital bills,” Bhattarai said. “We found that hospital reports also include concessions provided to patients who sought outpatient, emergency, and X-ray services.”The hospital’s director Narayan Dahal claims to be following all government instructions. He says 10 percent hospital beds are set aside for needy patients who are not charged any treatment fees, while 10 percent of service seekers also get discounts.Although the Biratnagar Metropolis has directed all health facilities under its jurisdiction to allocate free beds and provide free services to the needy, inform service seekers about the government-provided services, and submit a list of all patients who have received the services, the directive is ignored more often than followed. According to Bhattarai, medical establishments must get a letter from the local unit before making any upgrades or purchasing any equipment. “But the hospitals have been found presenting fake documents in order to acquire such permits,” he said. “The metropolis has refused such permits to 12 private hospitals in the current fiscal year.”Butwal Sub-Metropolitan City in the Lumbini Province has also taken no concrete step to ensure private hospitals adhere to Health Facility Operation Standards-2020. Despite having the authority to carry out inspections, the sub-metropolis’ apathy has deprived hundreds of needy patients of various government services. The sub-metropolis with 17 wards has more than two dozen big hospitals in the Butwal bazaar area itself. Not one of them adheres to the government’s health regulations. But the sub-metropolis is yet to monitor these hospitals. Yubraj Pandey, chief of Butwal Sub Metropolitan’s health department, says they have been unable to inspect medical institutes due to a lack of a proper set of rules.“I have just been transferred here. Discussions are underway to prepare legal requirements,” he said. Private hospitals in Butwal only began filing their reports two months ago after a joint meeting, informs Chief of the Sub Metropolitan’s Education and Health Department Mitramani Khanal. Twenty-year-old Suraj BK of Sarawal Rural Municipality-2 in West Nawalparasi got into a motorcycle accident on April 26. He suffered injuries on both his legs and was taken to Zenus Hospital and Research Centre in Butwal. Suraj was handed a bill of Rs 70,000 for treatment but he did not have the money to clear the bill and sought the hospital’s help. “The hospital refused to provide any discount. They in fact refused to discharge me. I got my discharge papers only four days later after I paid almost Rs 100,000,” he said. “I had to get a loan to pay the hospital bills as my father, who is a farmer, did not have that kind of money.”Dr Sharda Singh, the hospital director, said Suraj did not qualify for a discount as he did not have a recommendation letter from the local unit. “Patients have to get a recommendation to avail of free services at private hospitals but Suraj could not bring one,” she said. “I was in the hospital bed for four days. I could not have secured a recommendation from the local unit in that state,” said Suraj. Ishwari Prasad Chapagain, a civil society leader of Rupandehi and a member of the Consumer Interest Protection Forum, says private hospitals in Butwal are more interested in making money than helping those in need. “They do not follow government mandates. They act as if they have to bear the expenses of providing free service to the poor when in fact they get tax rebates and such for such services,” he said. “The sub-metropolis also does not do the needful. Everyone is corrupt including the city officials.”  \nIn an adaptation of musical chairs repeatedly being played in Nepal since 2015, two performers take turns installing the third contestant on the throne after hush-hush parleys and midnight settlements. The winner this time is Khadga Prasad Sharma Oli, the unchallengeable supremo of the CPN-UML and the widely accepted chieftain of the Khas-Arya supremacists. Sher Bahadur Deuba, the chair of the Nepali Congress, figuratively carried Sharma Oli from his mansion at Balkot to the official quarters of the Prime Minister at Baluwatar. There is nothing dramatic about the political development and no surprising political shift in the power-sharing deal between the second and the largest party in Parliament under the leadership of the former. In Nepal, traditions of parliamentary procedure don’t apply, and conventions routinely fall by the wayside. The observance of ethical practices of democracy is often an exception rather than the rule.After the installation of the ethnonational chieftain as the chief executive, the jubilation in the dominant community is perhaps justified. The triumphant tone of the headline in one of the major newspapers in Nepali was unmistakable: “Ousted by mandamus, mandate reinstates”! Another editorialised it as an “opportunity for Oli” as if he hadn’t missed and misused one too many over three decades. A few other bigwigs of public life were equally celebratory, though mercifully less euphoric, about the return of Sharma Oli to the centre stage for the fourth time in less than a decade. A significant section of the dominant community is convinced that Sharma Oli is their best hope for the institutionalisation of the supremacist order that the 16-point conspiracy signed by four parties in 2015 had sought to establish for the continuation of Khas-Arya hegemony. In 2017, President Donald Trump coined a neologism with a midnight Tweet: “The state of our union was … covfefe.” The state of Nepal in the same year was so convoluted that I had to come up with an adjective to describe the prevalent supremacist atmosphere as “Oliological arguments that are neither logical nor illogical; but are doggedly obdurate, stubbornly bigoted, spiritedly jingoistic, determinedly prejudiced, indomitably chauvinistic, and unswervingly xenophobic in tone, tenor and intent.” All such propositions are beyond being true or false as they pander to the pleasurable prejudices of the existing order.Communal consensusNominally a democratic organisation espousing nationalistic socialism, the NC has always been a big tent party that offered shelter to the politicos swearing allegiance to a broad spectrum of ideologies. One could be a monarchist dyed in yellow, a pink socialist or a gilded capitalist, yet find ample space under the charismatic leadership of Bisheshwar Prasad Koirala. The definition of the “Nepali nation”, however, was common to all personal convictions of every politician.In keeping with the spirit of the anticolonial movements of the 1950s, the nationalistic aim of BP was the production of national unity with the voluntary erasure of diversities within the country. When Bedanand Jha of the Terai Congress talked about the political dimension of Pahadi domination, BP pitted Madhav Regmi against him and succeeded in mobilising the Madheshis to defeat all Madheshi contenders in the electoral fray. Benimadho Singh, a political novice, was picked to defeat the towering politician Bhadrakali Mishra. Nirgun Yadav happily vacated a constituency where Yadavs were in the majority to ensure the victory of Saroj Koirala.After the royal-military coup of 1960, the monarchists began a concerted campaign to defame the NC by questioning their nationalist credentials. The party was so much under pressure to prove its allegiance to the Pahadi identity that many of its Madheshi, Janajati and Dalit cadres began to flaunt ‘Nepali’ as their surname. When BP was the towering leader of South Asia, he could be seen in public in the white Churidar and black Sherwani ensemble. After adopting Daura-Suruwal upon becoming the Prime Minister, he was never seen in anything else, even when he was denied entry into the royal palace because the colour of his coat differed from the officially sanctioned shade for commoners.When Krishna Prasad Bhattarai went to New Delhi as the first Prime Minister of the country after the restoration of parliamentary democracy, he confronted a question about the exclusion of the Madheshis from the Nepali Army with an irrelevant retort that the Madheshis weren’t recruited as Gurkhas of foreign armies. Back home, the chutzpah of a descendant of the family priest of the Gorkhali royal family was celebrated as nationalistic. The long and short of the ideological examination is that the monarchists, the democrats, the Marxists and the Maoists subscribe to the same definition of Nepali nationality: The ethnonational supremacism of what has been constitutionally described as Khas-Arya community through the contested constitution of 2015. Due to the ethnonational solidarity around Nepalipan, perhaps a large section of the NC finds the control of Sharma Oli more comfortable than some of their own secular or somewhat less communal leaders.Alternative aspirationsThe Madheshis came to the streets in 2007 mainly because the Maoists and the mainstream parties had failed to address their aspirations of identity, representation and self-rule through the interim constitution. Divided between the territories under the control of Gorkhali expansionists and the East India Company (EIC) after the ratification of the treaty of Sugauli in 1816, the Madheshis continued to be a bewildered nation. Gorkhalis treated Madhesh as a productive territory to sustain their military. In the cost-benefit analysis of the EIC, the rate of return on the investment of holding on to the conquered territories in the flood-prone flatlands below the Churia ranges wasn’t worth the trouble. Abandoned by losers and winners alike, the Madheshis were left to their own devices for almost two centuries.Unlike the Pahadis in Madhesh, the Madheshis aren’t settlers in an alien land. The history of the Gorkhali conquest is hardly two centuries old, while the ancestors of the Maithils and the Awadhis have lived in the region for millennia. However, they hardly fall under the indigenous category in the sense of the Malaysian term bumiputera. The Tamils of Sri Lanka had to bear the burden of their association with British colonisers, but the Madheshis were at the forefront of struggles against Ranarchy and the absolutist regime of the Shahs.Despite sharing a racial lineage, the same people fought and got their separate states on the basis of religion and culture in India, Pakistan and Bangladesh. The Madheshis have no such collective memory of animosity with people across the international border. They are considered a permanent minority in their own land due to the hegemony of the ruling community.Apart from power-sharing, constitutional amendments to strengthen Khas-Arya supremacy appear to be the main agenda of the Sharma Oli government. Paradoxically, the Madheshis will probably be called upon to protect the constitution that they once burnt to register their protest because not doing so will create conditions for fresh confrontations and a further increase in state violence. Contemplating the fate of permanent minorities under the regime of a hegemonic majority, political theorist Mahmood Mamdani postulates, “… violence can be especially ferocious when one community comes to believe that it is the state.” Ruefully moans Cecil Day Lewis: It is the logic of our times, No subject for immortal verse – That we who lived by honest dreams Defend the bad against the worse. \nI recently attended the International Disability Arts Festival 2024 in Bangladesh, organised by the British Council. As a wheelchair user and disability advocate, I found the experience life-changing.When I arrived in Bangladesh, I didn’t see people with visible disabilities on the streets. No wheelchair users or people with visual impairments were in sight, and the overall accessibility was as bad as, if not worse than, what we have in Nepal. In Kathmandu, people with physical disabilities use modified scooters; in Bangladesh, I saw none. So, I was sceptical initially, thinking this might be another development sector’s attempt to appear inclusive without any substance.Breaking barriersMy doubts started fading with the first play I saw: “71 in Silence”. The play was about the Mukti Juddho, or the Bangladesh Liberation War, featuring wheelchair users and people with hearing and visual disabilities as actors. Their performances resonated with immense talent. Seeing them perform such complex movements and scenes, some even getting out of their wheelchairs and dancing on the floor, was inspiring. It was a big reminder of what can be achieved when barriers are removed and opportunities are given. Throughout the festival, actors with severe disabilities continued to take centre-stage not just as token representation but as lead performers. One of the standouts was the adaptation of William Shakespeare’s A Midsummer Night’s Dream, which was full of music and vibrance. The nearly house-full audience was captivated; the audience’s reaction to this play was unlike anything I'd seen in Nepal. There was a clear sense of awe and respect, not pity or discomfort. The audience were genuinely moved by the performers' talent and their storytelling. It made me wonder how we could create such an atmosphere of appreciation and understanding back home.One thing that impressed me was the plays’ creative use of sign language. In Nepal, we often have sign language interpreters standing at the side of the stage, making it difficult for deaf audiences to follow the action and the interpretation simultaneously. Here, the sign language was integrated into the performance. Characters would take turns interpreting sign language, making it a part of the play rather than a separate element. This made a big difference in inclusivity and accessibility. Incorporating this into Nepali theatres could be game-changing. But there are challenges. We would need to train the performers in sign language, which will take time and resources. There might also be resistance from those who are used to the traditional way. But the benefit—a more immersive experience for deaf audiences and a more inclusive show overall—will be worth it.From discomfort to confidenceI also met and talked to some performers, including a lead actor who walks using his hands and knees instead of a wheelchair. He is a final-year bachelor’s student and manages nine cows as part of his family’s livelihood. Acting has always been his passion, but he never had the chance to pursue it until this festival. Before becoming an actor, he felt uncomfortable about people staring at him while walking to his college. Now, with newfound confidence, he proudly returns those stares. He shared how even actors without disabilities look up to him as a mentor, which has been emotionally uplifting. Seeing so many people with disabilities from all over Bangladesh participating in these plays made me realise the importance of inclusive arts. It’s not just a leisure activity; it’s a tool for empowerment and changing societal perspectives. It also made me think of all the artists with disabilities in Nepal we are not tapping into. How many talents are we missing because we haven’t created the space? His journey from discomfort to confidence proves what happens when we open the arts to people with disabilities.The power of inclusive arts extends beyond Bangladesh. Traditional narratives that portrayed disabled characters as objects of pity or inspiration are being challenged. Instead, we're seeing more nuanced and authentic representations. However, progress is uneven. While some countries are making strides in inclusive policies for cultural spaces, others lag. The debate about disability inclusion in theatres is evolving, but it's clear that we need more than just accessibility ramps and sign language interpreters.Enabling the disabledIn Nepal, we have made some progress in making theatres more accessible to audiences with disabilities, introducing ramps and sign language interpreters. These are necessary but feel like tokenism—a box to tick rather than real inclusion. What is missing is the development of artists with disabilities themselves. Unlike what I saw in Bangladesh, I rarely see performers with disabilities on stage in Nepali theatre. We must go beyond making theatre accessible for audiences with disabilities and focus on developing artists with disabilities. This means training programmes, opportunities for artists with disabilities to lead creative projects and challenging the idea that disability is a barrier to creativity.I have been working with various people and organisations since 2019 to increase the cultural participation of people with disabilities in Nepal. Last year, I worked with the British Council to produce “Beyond the Norm”, a toolkit to make programmes and events more accessible to people with disabilities. It’s an easy-to-use document that all cultural practitioners should use. This year, my organisation is working with “Birds of Paradise” theatre, UK, on a disability theatre production. These are small steps through which I hope to support disability inclusion in the culture and arts sector as an audience and, more importantly, as creative professionals.One of the most impactful moments for me at the festival was a play in which the actor I met earlier was tangled in a rope and trying to move forward while others were pulling him back. That powerful scene portrayed how society holds people with disabilities back. His question “All the things you do are normal and beautiful, but what we do is different and abnormal. Why?” left the audience speechless. \nThe first edition of the Nepal Living Standards Survey (NLSS-I) 1995-96 aimed to create “unique opportunities to assess the poverty situation in the country and carry out many other research works by providing a large database at a single reference point.” Simultaneously, the survey operation aimed to contribute to the capacity building of the then Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS) in conducting sample surveys. In a sense, it was an experimentation and training opportunity created for the next generation of sample survey researchers. This, therefore, had obvious caveats on the robustness of its outcomes and usability of inferences.Last month, the National Statistical Office (NSO), the rebaptised CBS, published a report of the fourth edition of the Survey (NLSS-IV) 2023-24. The original objective of the NLSS to “assess the poverty situation” does not seem to have changed. However, in nearly three decades of exercises that published three editions—1996, 2004 and 2011—this government entity seems to have barely learned to conduct such sample-based surveys, improve its inferential credibility, and maintain research integrity while working with a disproportionately small sample of a large population.Unrepresentative samplingNo doubt, sample surveys, as against population surveys, are risky and can provide only indicative inference even if they are implemented with utmost professionalism and high precision research. Otherwise, they suffer from self-selection bias and inferential misrepresentation due to underrepresentation of data variation. Besides, creating a mini sample from an already available population dataset to inquire into the topic that the population sample itself could carry out better is a redundant exercise and a misuse of resources. First, the NLSS rituals on top of the National Census do not add any value to better understanding the country's socioeconomic realities. Second, the authenticity of small-sized sample surveys like the NLLS can be established if, and only if, their statistical outcomes are consistent with those of comprehensive surveys like censuses. The NLSS exercises have failed on both counts.For the NLSS-IV, data was collected from a sample of 9,600 out of 6.761 million households, or 0.14 percent. When it is disaggregated into selected 15 geographical domains, the average number of households surveyed in each domain is only 640. This is certainly a gross underrepresentation to statistically infer anything meaningful. For example, the NLSS-IV claims the proportion of households in Nepal receiving remittance income has reached 76.8 percent. It also argues that it is a dramatic increase from 23.4 percent in 1996 and 56.8 percent in 2011. Nevertheless, it is not only inconsistent with the National Census 2021 data but also does not reflect the actual ground reality. Inferential flawsThe Census 2021 states that the total number of individuals absent from home, possibly to be in a foreign country, is only 2.169 million. It is next to impossible to receive remittances by 5.192 million (76.8 percent of 6.761 million households recognised by the Census) households sent by only 2.169 million migrating individuals, including seasonal absentees. Among them, even if only one individual from each household is considered out of home and remits the earnings back, only 32 percent of the households are likely to receive any kind of remittance. The direct positive correlation between the outmigration of individuals and remittance income can no way be undermined or ruled out.There were similar inconsistencies in NLSS-2011 and Census-2011. The Census stated that the population away from the country then was only 1.921 million, while the NLSS-III claimed that nearly 57 percent of the 5.7 million households benefitted from the remittance receipts. As such, which inferences and conclusions should people believe in and use—the Census or the NLSS, both published by the same agency? There seems to be a great deal of confusion even in defining what essentially constitutes the 'remittance' for the purpose of this report.Even in determining the poverty line and poverty-related indicators—the sole stated objective of the NLSS exercise—both the data and inferences are messy, to say the least. It has adopted a new poverty line using 2022/23 as the base year. The updated line marginally increases the minimum income bar. A Nepali citizen is now classified as poor if her annual per capita total consumption expenditure is less than NRs72,908 annually, or Rs200 (USD 1.5 at 1 USD=NPR 133) per day. The report, at one instance, claims that Nepal has seen a significant reduction in poverty headcount over the last 12 years, from 25.16 percent in 2010-11 to 3.57 percent (vis-a-vis 2011 inflation-adjusted poverty line) in 2022-23. In the next paragraph, it says, “20.27 percent of the population in Nepal lives below the new poverty line”.The definitional relation in practice between the 'headcount' and the 'poverty line' is that the 'national poverty headcount ratio is the percentage of the population living below the national poverty line.' Then how do the claims that poverty declined to 3.57 percent while 20.27 percent of the population still languish below the poverty line by earning only USD 1.5 dollars a day stand together? Regardless of these purely data doctoring or data cooking machinations, the critical question is: Whether the poverty rate actually declined in reality or not.Extrapolations and excusesThese are only a few examples of research by a government agency that is dependent on a small set of data while resources are disproportionately used in clever tabulation and preparation of politically convenient reports to show progress in critical topics like poverty reduction. No research finding should be only a circus of data overexploitation and far-fetched extrapolation like this. Whenever the discrepancies in research outcomes of government agencies are called out, the instant response is to point fingers towards methodological differences or biased perceptions. Also, the “we are the government” mindset runs deep to prove their findings as sacrosanct and beyond question.Nepal is pathetically handicapped in data-based research. There is a clear dearth of institutions in the country, academic or otherwise, that have the technical capacity and financial resources to carry out large-scale, nationwide research to counter the spuriousness of many such government surveys and research outcomes. International development partners, for instance, the World Bank, which has been supporting the NLSS endeavours since the beginning in 1995, have hardly paid any attention to the fact that the effective presence of autonomous research institutions out of government influence can better contribute to national policymaking. A plethora of survey-based research norms and practices, specifically in government-owned agencies, must change now. \nNepal is not even halfway through this monsoon, and the rain has already brought deadly floods and landslides. As per official records, from June 10 to July 14, a total of 108 people have died, many more have been injured, and 3,552 families have been displaced across the country. The death toll is likely to mount as more bodies surface from the recent tragic Simaltal incident on the Mugling-Narayanghat road section (also called Madan Ashrit Highway), where a landslide swept two buses carrying 65 people into Trishuli River last week. It is unfortunate that our efforts to prevent human loss have been far from satisfactory. Constant politicking, lack of preparedness and a culture of dismissing expert research and suggestions on road construction all make monsoons a perfect storm of disasters. Take the Mugling-Narayanghat road. The road was widened without factoring in its geographical vulnerability and landslide risks, and the landslides there have only gotten worse in the past few years. Moreover, haphazard roads built above the major roads throughout the country have put many lives in danger, as happened during the Simaltal incident. As per a Setopati report, the debris flow brought about by the road construction in the settlements above the Simaltal area reportedly resulted in the incident.Geologists have consistently raised concerns about the risks associated with the highway; however, their words have fallen on deaf ears. In June of this year, the landslide risk assessment flagged 11 areas on the highway as zones that needed immediate study and 25 areas as prone to landslides. Similarly, according to Kaski district’s Disaster Response Plan (as reported by Himalkhabar), 25 settlements are in danger of flood and landslide in Pokhara Metropolitan City. As a part of their disaster preparedness, each district is mandated to prepare a disaster response plan. Despite this, when the time comes to act, they lack the necessary human resources, equipment, or budgetary support to prevent disasters and rescue people. We don’t have to look far to see how the country’s disaster preparedness has failed—Simaltal has received major attention in terms of rescue yet, as of now, neither the buses that were swept away nor most of those missing have been found. When it comes to dealing with disasters, our authorities have always adopted a wait-and-see approach. The Home Ministry, responsible for overseeing national disaster preparedness, issued a notice on preventive measures, including suspending the plying of vehicles at night in high-risk areas, only after the tragic incident on the Mugling-Narayanghat highway. These measures could still prove beneficial, but we need a long-term solution and pre-planning. As local governments are still ill-prepared to handle pre-disaster preparedness as well as post-disaster rescue efforts, it is up to the federal government to equip the community level bodies with enough budget and equipment. We have had enough of these life-threatening disasters. Even though it is already late, all three levels of government must heed the experts, engineers and geologists when constructing or widening roads. The much-needed slope stabilisation through bio-engineering should be done on the Mugling-Narayanghat highway and other risky paths without further delay. The governments should also prioritise rigorous monitoring and follow-ups on road construction. We cannot afford to lose any more lives to these disasters. \nKP Sharma Oli begins his fourth term as prime minister with a bit of baggage. Most infamously, during his third term, when the time came to hand over his prime ministership to his coalition partner as earlier agreed, Oli chose to dissolve the House of Representatives—twice—rather than voluntarily give up power. Thankfully, the Supreme Court stepped in to avert an untimely election. Rightly or not, Oli has over the years built a reputation for wheeling and dealing and for surrounding himself with yes-men. He is not someone comfortable reaching across the aisle. In fact, his stubborn and acerbic nature has made it easy for others, including his coalition partners during previous terms, to take offence. At 72 and in iffy health, Oli is also seen as someone whose time in Nepali politics has come and gone. On the external front, too, challenges galore. In recent times, ‘China’s man in Nepal’, as dubbed by the Indian media, has had a difficult relationship with New Delhi. Of course, he must be lauded for taking a dogged stand against the 2015-16 Indian blockade. But then Oli started spouting all kinds of nonsense like claiming that Lord Ram was born in Thori of Nepal rather than Ayodhya of India, unnecessarily needling the powerful BJP establishment. These are big hurdles no doubt. But they are not insurmountable. During the latest negotiations with Congress leaders, for instance, he is reported to have assured them that he has ‘matured’ and will refrain from taking juvenile steps like dissolving the House on a whim. He is also someone strongly wedded to the idea of a two-party polity, a strategy that suits many in the Congress just fine. (Whether it suits the country is a different thing.) As the agreement between the two big parties in the lead up to the formation of the new government is yet to be made public, it is hard to make definite predictions. Yet if Oli can channel his strong character to use the over two-thirds majority in the House for productive purposes, he can get a lot done. On India too, Oli was for long known as someone with personal rapport with top Indian leaders—and he still has the confidence and capacity to take personal initiative to mend fences. Disliked in Delhi and mistrusted in Beijing, Oli nonetheless will have his task cut out maintaining an increasingly difficult balance between the two neighbours.The priority for the new Oli government, just like it was for its predecessors, will be to breathe some life into a stagnant economy. A message of political stability given through a two-thirds majority will help. Yet both in and outside the country, there is a justified suspicion over the longevity of this ‘unnatural’ Congress-Communist coalition. Oli as prime minister must be ready to make some tough personal adjustments in order to stop the cycle of instability in government. This means not just reining in his natural tendency to rebuff critics and rely on a small coterie on all vital matters but reaching out to coalition partners and even the opposition parties as often as he can. In fact, if Oli tries to go it alone, before long this coalition too will implode. Whether while trying to revise the constitution, making important appointments, or crafting a budget, his government must be seen to be striving to engage the widest section of relevant stakeholders. The onus is on Oli to prove his critics wrong.  \nPrime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal is all set to go today. After being taken for a ride turn-by-turn by a distant third CPN (Maoist Centre) led by Dahal, the two big parties in Parliament—the Nepali Congress and the CPN-UML—have joined hands to form a coalition government. And with this, Dahal, who remained at or around the power centre for almost a decade even with his party performing poorly in polls, is pushed to the periphery—at least for a while. The overzealous commentaries about Dahal being thrown off the grid of power may, however, be premature. As per the current constitutional provisions, coalition culture is here to stay. And considering how adamant the political parties are in sticking to their morally corrupt politics, no one can tell if the impending Congress-UML coalition stays for the next three months or three years. As Dahal goes today, there does not seem to be much point assessing how well his coalition with the UML fared in just four months of its existence. It takes decades, even centuries, to build a nation. The five-year term of Parliament is the minimum required for a set of leaders to make some impactful decisions for the country. There certainly are provisions for changes in the government, even in the midst of the parliamentary term, but these should be exceptional cases. What we have got, however, is a perpetuity of the coalition culture. It is this perpetuity that has halted the nation-building process for decades now. With the same set of three old men playing the hot potato game around power, nation-building has become a staccato performance at best. Just as one performer comes to the stage and starts his performance, he is pushed to the sidelines in the middle of the act.Pushpa Kamal Dahal will perform the last scene of the four-month act that was his coalition. He will come on stage, search for UML chairperson KP Sharma Oli among the audience, and call him a betrayer. He will then look for the Nepali Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba and blame him for being power-hungry. Oli and Deuba will then take the stage by turns and blame Dahal for trying to take them for fools. Such acts have been repeatedly performed, with the same set of plots, performances and actors. There is certainly a new actor on the block, a television presenter who thought he had had enough of shouting out of the small screen. He stepped out of the screen into the field and competed with the old guards whose noses he wanted to break—as his infamous saying went.The moment Rabi Lamichhane came to the spotlight after an impressive electoral showing, the masks he had worn all along started falling off. After a while, he became the fourth old man in the club of politicians who see fault in everyone else besides themselves. Only that Lamichhane was louder, more contemptuous of the media, and as directionless as the other three when it came to envisioning a future for the nation. As Dahal is forced to step down and Oli is about to take the helm, it is worth pondering if this sordid cycle of drama will end anytime soon.  \nThe July 1 midnight deal between the Nepali Congress and the CPN-UML, the first and the second largest parties in the federal lower house respectively, turned national politics on its head. Pushpa Kamal Dahal was thrown out as prime minister and KP Oli assumed the country’s leadership. The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal asked Maoist Centre leader Ram Karki, who has cultivated an image of a rebel within the party, on his reading of the event. How do you see the CPN-UML’s rebuffing of the CPN (Maoist Centre) and formation of a new government with the Nepali Congress?If you see it from the perspective of those who believe in parliamentary democracy, this is wrong. In the system, the largest party is believed to have the public mandate to run the government and the second-biggest to be the main opposition. A weak opposition makes for a weak parliamentary system. The system isn’t an ideal one for us [communists]. The two parties have made a mockery of the system they advocate for. Why didn’t the Maoist party that championed progressive agendas implement them when in government?We should admit that we lost the moral authority to implement and execute those agendas. We could have implemented those ideals by mobilising peasants, working-class groups, and people from oppressed communities, but our grip and connection with them have loosened.Why did the party and the leadership distance itself from the working class?The state has two arms—coercive and persuasive. The Maoists succeeded in using coercive force. But you can’t use this all the time. One has to use persuasive force most of the time. When we joined mainstream politics, we were the leading political force. We were in power. At the time we should have changed our education sector. For that, we should have worked on our curriculum and trained teachers. Our educational system is guided by patriarchal and feudal values. We need to orient people to questioning and following science. The party couldn’t do so. Had we done so, we would now have a critical mass with us. The Maoist leaders lost the moral ground. When you preach lofty ideas, the public won’t listen to you. They instead watch your lifestyle. Earlier, the Congress and the UML leaders, who were outsiders in Kathmandu, got ‘polluted’ when they worked in collusion with the capital’s elites. We, too, got ‘polluted’ by hobnobbing with the two parties. The working class and oppressed communities that had helped the Maoist party fight the state felt betrayed. The leaders and the masses are separated now. The Maoist party was the true leader of the progressive agenda such as inclusion, federalism, secularism and republicanism. These ideas are still valid, but the party failed to honour them. It failed because it lost its strength and disconnected itself from the class it fought for. It tried to become the leader of all people. The oppressed communities felt betrayal, while the other classes didn’t accept the party because of our past. Do you think the Congress and the UML will try to undermine progressive agendas enshrined in the new constitution?They have also sold lofty ideas to the people in the past. A counter-revolution under the two parties’ leadership is not easy. Their rank and file won’t accept it. The Congress, in fact, is not only a political party but a collective where you find radical Hindus as well as hardcore secularists. It stays strong as long as it works as a unified force of various groups. But when it imitates communists and tries to be a rigid cadre-based party, it loses its space and strength. So the Congress can’t lead a counter-revolution against progressive ideas. Counter-revolution is not easy, but the reactionary forces have certainly succeeded in regaining their space.Observers and politicians from rival parties claim that the Maoist Centre is now in an existential crisis. Do you think it can make a comeback?More importantly, the space that used to be occupied by the Maoist party is now left unoccupied.Can’t the UML or other forces make inroads into that space?The UML is a tried and tested force. Even the Maoist Centre is now described as a tested force. How can older forces enter that space? A force mightier than the Maoists can emerge. As a Maoist party member, I still vow to rejuvenate and revive the Maoist Centre. I am trying to convince my fellow comrades to do that. But my voice hasn’t prevailed. I have been presenting my papers in the party’s general conventions. We still have a strong belief that sooner or later, we will prevail because we are raising valid issues.Various leftist groups have at various times tried to create a strong, united left political force in Nepal. Do you think ideas like socialism and communism still attract the youth?Some rebel voices within our parties take some initiatives to raise our collective voice to build pressure on party establishments. But this has been limited to theoretical debates and failed to translate into politics. A theory or philosophy is like an iron plate, while crafting a tool from that iron is politics. We haven’t been able to transform our ideas into political action. If a leader floats a political agenda, the people first study the leader’s integrity. If a leader with a strong moral authority proposes an idea, people trust and follow it. If Gandhi was wearing a suit and telling people to wear handwoven khadi, Indian people wouldn’t have followed him. Similarly, if Mao was using clothes, watches and vehicles from developed countries while preaching for simplicity, Chinese people wouldn’t have followed him.Our people don’t listen to our leaders because they don’t see the leaders walk the talk. Youths are always attracted by adventurism; they are receptive and sensitive to certain incidents. Now, they aren’t following us because they don’t find any adventure and newness in our ideas. If we do some soul searching and correct ourselves, the Maoist Centre still can lead the process to complete the unfinished progressive agendas. Is that possible under the current Maoist leadership that has lost its credibility while staying in power for long? Will the people trust them?People will judge them based on their actions. If the Maoist leaders were more credible, there would be no space for the Congress and UML to come together. Either one or the other force would seek the Maoist party’s support. They wouldn’t have dared to ignore the Maoist party that led progressive issues in the recent past. They were emboldened because of the Maoists’ diminishing influence. Therefore, we have to correct ourselves in practice.You said that the classes and communities the Maoist party used to lead now have no leader. Can new outfits occupy that space?The traditional parties—the Congress, the UML and the Maoist Centre–don’t have any strategic vision on where they want to see the country in 20 years. The new forces are worse. They hit a ball and wherever it reaches, shift the goalpost there. They carry the goalpost with them. New forces with such visions can’t replace old parties. History shows that Nepal has witnessed political upheavals in a gap of 10-15 years. In the past such tsunamis have changed the political systems. Now we have seen sparks of movements but they are scattered. New forces need an ideological weapon. The Maoists forgot to sharpen their ideological weapon over time by holding ideological debates and upgrading themselves. Another is intra-party democracy. A political party that doesn’t practise intra-party democracy can’t enforce democracy in society.From the perspectives of intra-party democracy, the Maoist Centre is probably the most undemocratic of major political forces. Why?In the Congress, you are free to speak, but you don’t have a say in execution. Communist parties are too centralised. The structure conceptualised around a century ago in the context of wars and other contexts hasn’t been updated. Even new parties are run by the party chiefs imitating the anomalies of traditional forces. A leader is praised if s/he takes immediate decisions, gets them endorsed from the party committees and implements them swiftly. Those who say they have to first discuss the issue in party committees are described as weak. Such a trend is killing intra-party democracy.Do you think the Congress-UML coalition will succeed?A coalition between the parties that don’t even have a common minimum programme is a coalition of opportunists. They don’t have a moral ground either. On ideological grounds, the Congress still cites the late BP Koirala because no other leader of the party has worked on the theoretical front for decades. Such is also the situation with communists. They still cite the theoretical works of the late Pushpa Lal Shrestha. The current alliance is not a principled one, it’s a collaboration between opportunists. So, don’t expect anything better.How do you evaluate the outgoing government?It did nothing for the class it represents. The prime minister’s secretariat might have prepared a list of ‘100 important achievements of the government’. But what is the government’s priority? It failed to even give skills to those going abroad in search of work. They would have found better work had we given them valuable skills. Not only the outgoing one but all the previous governments have failed. The Congress-UML alliance has said it wants to review the constitution and amend the charter when necessary. How do you see this idea?This will be backtracking from the present constitutional roadmap. It is dishonest to create hindrance in implementing the federal system and then suggest the system is a burden. Such moves would give space to those who want to raise questions on republic and secular systems. There is a strong faction that lobbies for Hindutwa in the Nepali Congress. It is no secret that the Congress and the UML were not in favour of republic, secular and federal systems. But later, they rode the popular wave. But they have still not internalised it, and there are some regressive elements in both the parties but the people, who have come too far, won’t backtrack.Don’t you think the coming together of Congress and UML may ensure political stability?Instability is okay for me because stability may not necessarily be good for a country like ours. See, a single leader has been ruling a party continuously for over 30 years. What if they rule the country in a similar way? Look at some countries where a single leader has ruled for decades. The current arrangement is better than such stability.Will the Maoist party chairman and prime minister, who didn’t even appoint a minister from a Dalit community, have the moral authority to again champion the agenda of the oppressed?Appointing a minister is again an ornamental approach to appease certain communities. What we should do is ensure the participation of oppressed communities in policymaking.But party chair Dahal may again seek ways to get back to power. Will he pay attention to these issues?We should stop this chase for power at all cost. We will say this in our party meetings. We should accept the reality that we have just 32 seats and so we won’t get sufficient space to implement any important programmes even if we join the government.The way your party chief remained in power for over 18 months using various tactics, was it right?If you see it through a parliamentarian’s lens, it looks quite smart. If you see it through a Marxist perspective, just becoming a prime minister is futile if you can’t implement your policies and strengthen republicanism and participatory democracy. \nThe Nepali Congress and the CPN-UML last week reached an agreement to form a coalition government under the leadership of UML chair KP Sharma Oli. As a part of the package, they also aim to make certain changes to the constitution. The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal asked Pradeep Gyawali, deputy general secretary of UML, the reasons behind the coming together of the two largest parties, how they plan to run the government and to review and amend the constitution.Many are seeing the Congress-UML alliance as something unusual. What factors brought the two largest parties together even as there is no crisis-like situation or a special task such as constitution writing?Definitely, in normal parliamentary practice, the two largest parties don’t forge an alliance to run a government. The party that gets the biggest mandate leads the government, and the other big party remains in the opposition to make the ruling force accountable. In Nepal, the country’s two major forces, the Congress and the UML, have also joined hands in certain junctures for certain purposes. They worked together to make the constitution in 1990, to conduct general elections in 1999, to complete transition after the 2006 people’s movement and to bring out the constitution in 2015. We felt a need for a similar collaboration this time around. After the November 2022 elections, we saw three alliances in our parliament. At first, Maoist Centre chair Pushpa Kamal Dahal became prime minister with our support, but he failed to abide by the agreement sincerely. He changed the coalition within a month. The subsequent alliance between the Congress and the Maoist Centre lasted for a year. He again sought the UML’s support. Within four months of the March 4 deal with the UML, he started yet another gameplan to join hands with the Congress under the pretext of forming a national consensus government. It was quite unusual for the prime minister himself to instigate instability in the government. He publicly boasted that he had a ‘magical number’ [32 seats in the House of Representatives]. He thought that he could employ the tactic of ‘use and throw’ with the two largest parties and rule the country for the full term. He was completely indifferent to people’s plight, the country’s pressing issues and service delivery. This was the height of irresponsibility. So, the UML and Congress leaders concluded that the time had come to intervene to ensure political stability and service delivery and make sure public frustration doesn’t get out of hand. Did external factors play a role? Recent statements by UML leaders suggest that the party has taken it seriously. When national forces are weak, the neighbouring countries and international forces become more cautious, even more so given Nepal’s geo-political situation. Some of their concerns are valid. They fear political instability in Nepal may have an adverse impact on their genuine issues. We have to take this naturally. Second, it is no secret that we have a long legacy of facing external interference. Sometimes such interventions are carried out covertly and sometimes overtly. Therefore, national forces should be strong. Some political parties and leaders have a tendency of seeking external forces’ support to fulfil their vested interests. In return, they serve the external forces’ undue interests. Formation of a government is a purely domestic affair, but in our case sometimes it also becomes an issue of geopolitical interest. It is said that the UML was spooked when it learned that Prime Minister Dahal had reportedly approached the Congress for a new alliance. This reportedly happened after Dahal returned from New Delhi following Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s swearing-in.We were taken by surprise when the Congress leaders told us that the prime minister had reached out to them with a proposal to form a national consensus government. We were informed about the development from the leaders of the main opposition party. When we reached the March 4 deal with the prime minister, we thought he came to us with a commitment to course correction. Based on that, we supported him almost unconditionally. We didn’t bargain while sharing ministerial portfolios and didn’t talk about the prime minister’s term. We had even thought of allowing Dahal to run the government for the full term if the government functioned well and people were satisfied. We hadn’t even imagined that we would have to think about changing the coalition within four months.We definitely had certain grievances such as a lack of consultation with our party and our lawmakers while preparing the government’s policies and programmes and while allocating budget. Our party chair brought up this issue with the prime minister. But our concerns weren’t addressed. They had already started to ignore us. There were several issues with the prime minister, but we were committed to the partnership. But they had already gone too far. Fortunately, the Congress leaders didn’t accept the offer and instead raised critical questions about the rationale behind the proposal. Basically, the Congress didn’t trust Prachanda ji [Dahal] and came to us. It concluded that Dahal didn’t come with the intent of solving the country’s problems but to manoeuvre between the Congress and the UML.Besides jointly running the government, constitution amendment is another major aspect of the latest Congress-UML deal. What are the provisions the parties want to change?There are four major objectives of this agreement. Safeguarding national interest; strengthening economy; improving governance and service delivery; and ensuring political stability. A debate has started that some constitutional provisions are not helping maintain political stability. What we have said is that it’s been almost a decade since the promulgation of this constitution. Some of its provisions are yet to be implemented. On the other hand, provincial governments complain that they have not been able to work in a full-fledged way because the federal government has still not made some laws they need. So, first, we will undertake a comprehensive review on the progress in the course of implementing the constitution and the challenges we faced in the past decade, among other things. While doing so, we will find out if there are provisions that have posed challenges in maintaining political stability and running a stable government and suggest amendments accordingly.So, it’s not only about the amendment but also about review, assessment and recommendation for amendment, if there is a need. Even if the amendment process begins, it will be limited to ensuring political stability and won’t touch other aspects of the statute. There is no need to over-react. For instance, some Maoist leaders are trying to make it a political issue by describing it as a regressive move. That is wrong.So as per the two-party deal, the statute will be reviewed but not necessarily amended?Yes, whether to go for amendments will depend on the findings of the review. No constitution in the world is perfect. Its success largely depends on the practitioners. So, first we have to differentiate between the role of the constitution and the practitioners. It is true that our society is divided over certain provisions of our constitution. All these issues will be considered, but the fundamental features of the constitution such as democracy, inclusion and federalism won’t be altered. Our priority would be to only remove hindrances in making the system more functional, people-oriented and productive.Of late, people are debating the electoral system, provincial structure and secularism. Will these issues also be dealt with?Federalism is a new system for us. In fact, it is still an in-the-making process in Nepal. We have to note some timelines while analysing the performance of provinces. After the provincial and federal elections in 2017, the first provincial governments were formed in 2018, and they worked for around three years in a stable way. With small cabinets, they worked genuinely to strengthen the provincial system. At the time, most provincial cabinets had around six to seven ministers. They weren’t severely criticised at the time. The wrong trends in the provinces started with the division of the then Nepal Communist Party and the fall of the NCP-led governments at the centre as well as provinces. We saw the trend of horse-trading in provinces. Small parties made unjustified bargaining for ministerial portfolios, chief ministers started splitting ministries and increasing the number of ministers in their cabinets. Also, the November 2022 polls again gave a fragmented verdict, further augmenting the instability and anomalies at the provincial level. So, the problem is the way we are handling things more than the provincial structures. The time isn’t ripe to seek an alternative to the provinces. As far as the electoral model is concerned, we included proportional electoral (PR) system after long debates and discussions. Based on three general elections held after 1990, a conclusion was drawn that the first-past-the-post (FPTP) model couldn’t properly represent the historically under-represented sections. The premise is still valid. Based on the achievements, we may exclude certain communities from the list. But that time hasn’t come. Two questions raised over the use of PR are valid. Is the system really doing justice to the strata and class of the society for which it was introduced? This is the question not about the PR system but the leaders who use it. Similarly, some questions: Is proportional representation required in executive as well because representation is basically vital for policy making? The forms and modalities of the PR system might be discussed, but no one has even thought of removing the inclusive system.Similar is the case with secularism. The spirit is to make the state patron of all religions in the country. However, some sections of society have often tried to misuse and misinterpret the new constitutional provision. They try to interpret secularism as openly allowing rampant religious conversion, and some have made it an excuse to attack the age-old Sanatan faith. For instance, if the President or prime minister visits Lumbini, gurudwara or a shrine of any other faith on certain occasions, that is taken positively, but when they visit Pashupatinath Temple, a section of people raise questions. These activities have made some people think that these attacks on our Sanatan faith are taking place because of the secular system. There is no problem in the constitutional provision because the statute added an explanatory note that states, “‘secular’ means religious, cultural freedoms, including protection of religion and culture handed down from time immemorial.” But some extremist activities have given wrong impressions.Some experts believe the problem of fragmented mandate can be addressed by increasing the threshold required for a political party to be eligible to get PR seats, which can be done by amending laws. Will the Congress-UML alliance opt for this?Yes, this is one feasible option. I am in favour of this. As per the existing provision, a political party can secure seats under the PR category by securing 3 percent votes in the federal parliament and 1.5 percent votes in provincial assemblies. If a political organisation doesn’t even represent 5 or 7 or 10 percent of the population, what can they contribute to the country? You do politics to represent a sizable population and get a public mandate. Otherwise, the presence of such groups would only promote unreasonable bargaining and instigate instability in governments. This can be one of the agenda of the discussion between the two parties.This time, leaders have made it transparent that chiefs of the two parties will lead the government on a rotational basis. But why have other details of the agreement not been made public?There hasn’t been topic-wise discussions on specific provisions. The broader understanding is to review and assess the implementation aspect of the constitution and move ahead based on the findings of the assessment. We have also made it clear that such an act will be guided only by the objective of ensuring political stability and we will not go beyond that. Who will undertake this type of constitution review?We haven’t worked on it in detail. We haven’t reached any understanding. Naturally, inputs will be taken from the constitution makers, experts on constitutional law and politicians involved in this field. But no decision has been made on its nitty-gritty.The Rastriya Prajatantra Party that wants to revive the Hindu kingdom was the first party to welcome the Congress-UML deal while the Maoist Centre has accused Congress and UML of making a regressive move. So don’t you think this affair is tricky?I don’t think the political parties will touch the issues that the RPP talks about, such as reinstatement of Hindu kingdom and dissolution of federalism. No one is thinking about that. Also, the questions raised by the Maoist leaders have no meaning. They are only trying to make a political agenda.It also seems that the Congress and the UML floated this idea of reviewing the constitution to make a case for the two largest parties to form the government.That’s not true. This question undermines the spirit of this agreement. If this system fails, people will raise questions mainly to the leaders of the Congress and the UML, not Prachanda. It’s not only about running the government. We were already in the government and it isn’t a big deal for the Congress to return to power. If democracy fails, the democratic forces will lose the most. So we are genuinely working on this. The Congress and the UML are historical rival forces in Nepali politics. How can the two work together in government?It is true that the Congress and the UML are the two major competitors of this country. But we have some converging factors. First, we both believe in a broader democratic framework. Sometimes, the Congress may give more emphasis on liberal values while we may push for more socialism-oriented programmes. But the common ground is democratic values. We also have the experience of successfully carrying out certain tasks jointly. We may have some friction but we also have experience of managing bitter intra-party fighting as well as inter-party rivalry.How will the ministerial portfolios be shared in the new coalition?We haven’t reached any agreement in detail. As we aim to make this a ‘national consensus government’ we are in favour of accommodating other parties. So it will depend on the number of parties that join the Cabinet. Our only concern is that ministerial allocations should be done in a way that doesn’t weaken the prime minister in order to ensure that the head of the government can deliver.How can a government without the Maoist Centre and some other parties be called a consensus government?We have to wait for that. Leaders of political parties that fiercely criticise the government also join the Cabinet under one or other pretext. Some political parties seemingly cannot exist without being in the government.  \nIn the Secondary Education Examinations (SEE) conducted this year, over 52 percent of students failed to graduate to grade 11. The National Examination Board had enforced the ‘non-graded’ category from this year. The underperformance of the majority of school students has stirred a fresh debate about the test system. The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal sat down with former National Planning Commission member Usha Jha, who led the committee that recommended the government to adopt the letter grading system.How do you analyse the SEE results published on Thursday?People have reacted to it with shock, not me. In fact, on the basis of the teaching system that is being practised in our schools, I think the results are good. We get the results based on what and how we teach students. Over 52 percent of students have been categorised as non-graded. We need to identify and address the causes behind the bad results. I have heard some people blame the letter grading system. This is wrong. A form of letter grading system was already there. We only suggested an upgraded form of the system. If we start blaming the system, we won’t find the real cause of the problem. What may be the real causes that you are hinting at?The first is the poor quality of teachers in our country. A form of letter grading system was there even before. But it had two loopholes. First, the government took an approach whereby all students would pass. That gave an impression to the students that they don’t need to study hard. That degraded the quality of their education. Second, there was a system of giving marks based on the students’ performances in theoretical and practical exams. Of the total 100 marks, the practical exams made up 35 marks. Most students were given maximum marks in the practical exams. That helped them get higher grades even if they didn’t do well in theoretical exams. This system encouraged students to neglect theoretical studies. That has caused huge damage to our education system. The letter grade system introduced this year has closed those loopholes. But the letter grading system requires a learning environment. The system was introduced without adequate preparation for its effective implementation. Also, the Covid pandemic disturbed preparatory works at the time. We should have drastically improved classroom teaching practices, and trained teachers across the country because their teaching methods are outdated. They weren’t trained on the grading system. They give lectures and encourage students to memorise while the letter grading system requires a thorough process and encourages result-oriented learning. It doesn’t prioritise marks. Our teachers and schools lacked the capacity to implement the new system. Teachers weren’t trained and prepared. Even now, most teachers don’t know what the letter grading system is. The system is necessary to make our students compete in global markets.While we upgraded the system, we didn’t upgrade the schools and teachers. Our teachers engage only in routine and formal responsibilities such as completing textbook courses before the examinations. This system should be properly internalised not only by teachers and students but also school management, palikas [local units] and parents of the students. Only then can it be effectively implemented. These are the major reasons behind the poor results. How is the students’ performance evaluated in the letter grading system?First, teachers should study a lot. They take reference of the subject matter from the textbook and teach students giving a broader perspective of the matter. They have to engage the students practically on the issue. The students should be regularly evaluated based on their participation and response in study and activities. The teachers should teach them and constantly monitor whether they are learning and making progress. The marking should be based on that. So, in this system, the examination starts from day 1 and everyday activities contribute to their marks. It also takes other activities such as behaviour, understanding, presentation into consideration. Therefore, it is called a regular assessment system based on a thorough process, unlike the traditional three-hour-long yearly examination method. If the teachers aren’t competent to carry out these activities, this idea can’t yield good results. They badly need capacity enhancement. The pedagogy should be remodelled.What was the rationale behind the decision to implement this system?One reason was to upgrade our education’s standard on par with the international standards and make our students fit for global markets. In the course of formulating this policy, we undertook a comprehensive research of international practices. Based on that evidence-based research, we submitted a report to then education minister Giriraj Mani Pokharel. The government studied and endorsed it. Basically, this system was introduced with an objective of upgrading our education system in the changed context. But we lacked preparations to implement this idea.We will make a mistake if we change this system. I heard that the education minister [Sumana Shrestha] decided to make some changes in the policy and allow all non-graded students to sit for chance examinations, whereas the system says only those students who secured non-grades in two subjects can retake exams for the same subjects. There is no point in changing the method to favour even the students who have failed in all the subjects. She should have made it clear what factors made her change the criteria overnight. I cannot understand why the minister made the decision in a haste without considering its impact.In fact, our next step should have been capacity enhancement of teachers. The minister took some right decisions such as separating teachers from political parties. But an incumbent minister changing a system that was implemented by a previous minister would cause a problem. She could have formed a panel to conduct a study to find if the letter grading system is the main cause behind the students’ underperformance. But changing a policy through an order didn’t look good.Results show our students are very poor in mathematics, science and English. What could be the reasons?This is unfortunate. We saw similar trends in previous years as well. Mathematics and science are becoming more challenging. One reason is the lack of sufficient teachers for these subjects. Also, some teachers are under-utilised. Some teachers don’t go to the schools. So special measures need to be taken to manage teachers mainly for these subjects. Otherwise, we will have similar results in the coming years.The committee under your leadership recommended that those getting a GPA below 1.6 have to choose technical courses and those willing to study Grade 11 must score above 1.6 GPA. What was the idea behind that recommendation?The idea was to end the situation of halting students’ study and activities because of their lower grades. We have a government body in the form of the Council for Technical Education and Vocational Training (CTEVT) which has been offering dozens of vocational training based on the needs and interests of people. So our youths can join a suitable CTEVT course. We need more people in vocational fields. Skilled people aren’t available in the country. A large number of people working in technical fields in Nepal are from India. We included the provision in consultation with CTEVT officials. Minister Giriraj Mani Pokharel had also prepared a broad plan to implement the letter grading system and integrate the vocational part in our education system. The present government should improve the education system by enhancing teachers’ capacity and encouraging youths to join vocational training to fill the gaps in the employment market. Are the infrastructure and resources available in our education system sufficient to implement the grading system?Some schools lack even essential resources while in some we find misuse or underuse of resources. So, our education ministry should carry out a comprehensive mapping and find where teachers are required, where they are underutilised and where they are idle. Then, the government can make optimum use of the teachers and make additional investment on need-basis. Such an approach will yield better results. In general, our academic institutions lack resources as there is a trend of allocating insufficient budgets for the education sector. Yes, the letter grading system needs more investment. We have to work on teachers’ capacity enhancement and to provide learning materials to students. When you make an activity participatory, you certainly need resources and investments.Do we need to review our teacher recruitment process and our pedagogy in the universities that produce teachers?The government can consider new requirements while recruiting teachers and train them accordingly. Also, we need to update our curriculum and pedagogy for courses such as BEd and MEd to produce quality teachers. I have doubts about the quality of our graduates, post-graduates and even PhD holders due to the poor teaching and learning environment of our academic institutions. There is a need for more coordination and collaboration between the government and universities to address such issues.In the end, I want to stress that the government should adopt a clear and consistent policy and avoid ad-hoc decisions. The letter grading system is the best and we should push for that despite the challenges in its implementation. Just that it should have been enforced after enhancing teachers’ capacity. The problems we have now are due to lack of preparation. \nThe government’s recent decision to recall ambassadors, particularly Nepal’s envoy to India, just ahead of Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal’s visit to New Delhi, courted widespread controversy. What are the takeaways of the prime minister’s Delhi visit? What is the progress in implementing the trade and transit agreement signed with China and with the BRI projects? Thira Lal Bhusal of the Post sat down with Rupak Sapkota, foreign affairs advisor to the prime minister, for some insights.The government’s decision to recall ambassadors from 11 countries at once has come under heavy criticism. Why did the government take such a decision?In general, it has become a practice of sorts to recall incumbent ambassadors and appoint new ones after changes in the government or in the ruling coalition. This has both merits and demerits. The country’s foreign policy doesn’t change with a change in government. But every government and coalition has its specific policies, programmes and priorities. Therefore, even other countries make changes in political appointments as per the government’s priorities. Our case is a bit different. Ruling coalitions are frequently changed, and so are ambassadors. As there is a high chance of our politics being governed by coalitions given our electoral system, it has become necessary to establish a rational system on ambassadorial appointment. Either the political appointees themselves should voluntarily quit the job and return home just like vice-chair and members of the National Planning Commission do. Or there should be a consensus among major political forces to allow our ambassadors to serve out the full term.The second option of allowing ambassadors to serve out their term sounds better, doesn’t it?Definitely. Some initiatives have been taken with the objective of making our diplomatic appointments more prestigious, merit-based and better-managed. The government in 2019 introduced some criteria on ambassadorial appointments. We have to put more effort into ensuring that our ambassadorial appointees have the capacity to effectively carry out diplomatic duties. Once we establish a system of appointing envoys based on merit and not out of political biases, we can create a situation of allowing them to serve for the full term. Then, a change of coalition wouldn’t affect their continuity. We need to develop such a political consensus, given our geopolitical sensitivity.But the ambassadors appointed in recent years and their activities in host countries have lowered the bar of our diplomacy.We have seen rapid and huge changes in power equations in the world. In view of that, we can see some countries have appointed former ministers and even prime ministers as envoys to the countries with whom they have vital relations. They also appoint such personalities as envoys for a special mission. So, we have to think about ambassadorial appointments from different perspectives based on the changed context. It is high time that all the political forces and leaders agree on a basic point that those who have in-depth understanding and expertise of the field and can work for the best interest of the country will be appointed the country’s ambassadors. If the individual is competent, the person’s affiliation to a political party may not be a problem. But whether the person can work in the best interest of the country must be considered before appointment.But the government itself doesn’t seem serious about maintaining diplomatic decorum. For instance, the June 6 Cabinet meeting decided to recall the ambassador from India just days ahead of the prime minister’s New Delhi visit. There were also reports that the prime minister made the decision reluctantly due to pressure from coalition partners. What is the real story?It is nothing more than a coincidence. There were discussions about making changes in the ambassadorial positions in line with the March 4 changes in the ruling coalition. But it was deferred as the government needed to accomplish some important tasks and convene events such as the investment summit. When the government decided to change our ambassadors, it just happened to coincide with the prime minister’s visit to New Delhi to attend the swearing-in ceremony of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. It was a coincidence. Despite the decision, the ambassador had sufficient time to properly conclude all his engagements and duties there. The way he facilitated the process during the prime minister’s visit doesn’t reflect any misgivings about the government’s decision. So, it should be taken as a course that is in keeping with our tradition. In recent decades, other countries have given top priority to economic diplomacy, but the selection of our envoys and their activities doesn’t reflect that. Why aren’t we thinking in that direction?Yes, diplomacy in the past used to be one-dimensional, or it was conducted mainly by one particular ministry—the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. These days, many other ministries are engaged with international agencies. Economic diplomacy, labour diplomacy, climate diplomacy and security affairs have become crucial. We have to increase coordination, cooperation and collaboration among relevant agencies to make our international relations more fruitful and in line with the policies and goals set by our government.We have seen profound changes in terms of approaches, perspectives and dynamics of diplomacy in recent decades. All countries have started to give more importance to the competence of diplomats also in view of the increased geopolitical competition and rivalry seen between world powers. Rapid innovation in science and technology has not only eased our lives but also added challenges. We have to handle so many diplomatic engagements. Similarly, the number of international forums where we have to engage are increasing. These days, multilateral diplomacy and engagements have become as important. Even minilateral forums have started to play vital roles in international relations as the world powers have adopted multiple strategies to create their spheres of influence. In the meantime, the role of public diplomacy has become influential. So, a diplomat today must be dynamic and efficient enough to grasp the international situation, understand the sensitivity of the host country, articulate our country’s views efficiently and work in national interest. Therefore, it has become vital to be extra careful while selecting ambassadors.You talked about better coordination but we don’t see any correction in the practice of bypassing the foreign ministry while working with international agencies.Definitely, the foreign ministry is our focal point for all international relations conducted by a ministry or agency of our country. There should be no dispute about that. We need to make the foreign ministry more resourceful. Then, the ministry will have more capacity and efficiency to handle issues related to security, finance, labour and climate.Why have we failed to maintain reciprocity in terms of diplomats’ relations with the leaders of host countries? For example, our ambassadors in some capitals don’t get to meet the host leaders for years while the foreign envoys in Kathmandu can meet our prime minister and foreign minister directly and instantly.We have to see it from two perspectives. One is the power structure. In international relations, we can see the reflection of the asymmetric power relations between the big powers and other countries. The more developed and resourceful country’s influence in a host country can be seen and felt. Second, despite being an envoy from an underdeveloped or a small country, one can have diplomatic relations based on the principle of sovereign equality. It depends on the individual diplomat as well.In Kathmandu, we often err when dealing with foreign envoys. We have to decide what level of importance to give them. Therefore, some initiatives have been taken to correct and maintain consistency by implementing a diplomatic code of conduct that aims to integrate all activities through the foreign ministry. Foreign envoys will follow the system if we implement it consistently, irrespective of changes in the government. For that, there should be a political understanding at the national level.Let’s move to Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal’s recent India visit. Though it was mainly to attend the swearing-in ceremony of Indian Prime Minister Modi, he held some important political meetings. What are the takeaways from the visit?The visit was important from bilateral, regional and international perspectives. Traditionally, foreign affairs was described as an extended form of domestic affairs. But these days, international affairs have influence over domestic affairs as well. So such meetings and dialogues at the prime minister’s level are important. They exchanged views in a very cordial atmosphere. Of late, we have maintained bilateral dialogues at the political level on a regular basis and that has helped remove misunderstandings. Our prime minister’s emphasis is to hold bilateral dialogues both at the political as well as diplomatic levels in order to settle differences. India has taken this spirit positively.Second, the two prime ministers discussed how to expedite the implementation of the agreements reached between Nepal and India during Prime Minister Dahal’s official visit a year ago. The issue was discussed during the meeting between Prime Minister Dahal and Indian External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar as well. They also expressed satisfaction over progress in the implementation of bilateral agreements mainly in energy trade, connectivity and investment. In recent years, we have seen progress in investment, economic and trade sectors. Yet we still have some differences on border issues. That is an important and positive development in Nepal-India relations in recent years. In the past, when we had some differences on political, border or other issues, that used to badly affect other aspects of our relations. But now, both the countries agree to resolve outstanding issues through dialogue and our trade and all other affairs are moving ahead smoothly. This is the encouraging part of our relations. But border disputes can sour our relations anytime, right? Is there a sense of urgency to resolve it once and for all?The prime minister is for activating the concerned bilateral mechanisms to resolve such issues. He has also invited Indian Prime Minister Modi to visit Nepal. We can expect the Indian prime minister’s Nepal visit in near future. We can make some progress in resolving some outstanding matters such as border issues during the high level visit. I believe we will move ahead in this direction.Any progress on submitting the report of the Eminent Persons’ Group?During the meetings, the prime minister raised overall bilateral issues that include the matter related to the EPG report. I think once the mechanisms are activated and start working, that will create a situation for the report’s submission.Nepal and Bangladesh are completing homework for greater energy trade. India’s facilitation is a must for that. Is there any progress on securing the southern neighbour’s support for that?Progress in energy cooperation is a major achievement of this tenure of the prime minister. The progress is not limited to the bilateral level but goes to the regional level. A Cabinet committee of the Bangladesh government earlier this month approved a proposal to import 40 megawatts of electricity from Nepal. At present, we will use India’s infrastructure to export energy to Bangladesh. But for the long term there is a plan to build a dedicated transmission line for that. This shows it is not only Nepal that is interested in exporting its energy but other countries in this region are also interested in importing Nepal’s electricity. We have also signed an agreement to build a cross border transmission line with China. The doors are being opened for regional trade of our energy. This development will make India more open to importing energy from Nepal.Why are we failing to expedite projects under the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) of China?The economic cooperation between Nepal and China has substantially increased after we joined the BRI framework. So, Nepal has been benefitting from the BRI. We see some concern about the lack of progress on certain infrastructure projects to be built under the BRI framework. In fact, we are in a better position to implement the projects because now we can decide what kind of BRI projects are good for us based on the experience of project development and implementation under the BRI in other countries.We are working to finalise the BRI implementation agreement. Nepal wants to move ahead by signing the implementation agreement and developing the projects. Nepal joined the BRI framework based on its need to diversify trade and connect to the world market. The reality is the same now. So, we need to sign the implementation plan and move ahead as soon as possible. When I attended the Boao Forum a few months ago, I found the Chinese authorities and other stakeholders holding debates to build quality and resilient infrastructure. They also have plans to support the capacity enhancement of human resources and transfer technology in the BRI member countries.People mainly link the BRI with big infrastructure projects such as railway, road and transmission connectivity but there is no significant progress on these fronts. What are the roadblocks?In Nepal, no big infrastructure project has been completed on time, be it the Melamchi drinking project, airports, hydropower or road projects. We haven’t developed the capacity to build big projects, and we don’t envision any plan to operate after building it. So, not only with China but also with other countries and agencies, we have to seek support for small and medium-size projects that we can efficiently build and operate. Also, the third version of the BRI action plan has included building not only big but small and smart projects under the framework. We have to push for that. As we build our capacity, we can gradually take up big projects. For instance, now we can build big hydro projects on our own. It wasn’t the case until some years ago. We developed expertise in hydropower by building many small projects in the past few decades and gradually enhanced our capacity. We have already faced problems in operating the Pokhara and Bhairahawa airports. Is there any progress in taking Chinese support to operate the airports?We have to see both aspects—domestic as well as international use—of the airports. The two airports have helped us upgrade the quality of our domestic air travel as the passengers have benefited due to the upgraded infrastructure. The number of domestic passengers in these airports has increased significantly.It is true that there is no progress in terms of operating them as international airports. The government is studying all possibilities of their use based on their unique features. We are exploring various options in international markets to attract adventure tourists to Pokhara. Chinese stakeholders are also holding some promotional activities in Pokhara. Chinese authorities have told us that they are consulting with their provincial bodies and exploring possibilities to run regular flights to Pokhara. Similarly, the government is mobilising our embassies and other stakeholders in certain countries having a large number of Buddhist tourists to operate flights to Bhairahawa, and we have received some positive responses. I believe we will be able to operate regular international flights from these two airports soon.It’s been eight years since we signed the trade and transit agreement with China, which was touted as a historic deal between the two countries. Why haven’t we been able to implement it?Some symbolic steps have been taken in this period. For instance, a shipment was received from a third country [Vietnam] using a Chinese port in September last year. Similar other initiatives have been taken but these are limited to symbolic gestures. We have to prepare infrastructure and some legal basis to implement the agreements in a more result-oriented way. A bilateral meeting is being held this week. The meeting is likely to discuss how to bring the trade and transit protocol in an effective way. This meeting will discuss various issues faced so far and will also pave the way forward. We have also proposed to form a ministerial-level mechanism to oversee overall bilateral issues. The upcoming meeting will sort out various issues.The Chinese side was conducting a feasibility study of the Keirung-Kathmandu cross-border railway project. What is the progress?There is progress in various projects that we are carrying out with Chinese support. The cross-border railway feasibility study is in the final stage. Likewise, the study on the Chhahare-Tokha tunnel project is ongoing. A Chinese team is arriving to conduct a feasibility study of the Hilsa-Simkot road. A process to award a contract to build a friendly bridge at Hilsa with Chinese grants has begun. A foundation stone will be laid there soon. Also, a study to build the Chilime-Rashuwagadhi-Keirung 220kV cross-border transmission line is beginning soon. \nThe government has decided to make the National ID Card mandatory in order to receive services from government and public institutions. In the first phase, the June 6 Cabinet meeting made the National ID card number mandatory in 28 districts. People including federal lawmakers criticised the decision saying that it was enforced without first distributing the cards. In this context, Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal sat down with Yubaraj Katel, director general of the Department of National ID and Civil Registration.Let’s begin with a basic question. Why do we need a National ID card while we already have citizenship certificate, driving license, passport and voting card?There is a fundamental difference between a citizenship card and National ID. Citizenship establishes whether you are a citizen of the country and it helps you identify yourself with some basic details. In Nepal, it was also widely used as a service card. Wherever you go, you have to show the citizenship card—to open a bank account or acquire a SIM card for a phone. If we study international practices, there are mainly two cards—one is an identity card and the other is a service card. In 2018, the Nepal government came up with the idea of distributing national identity cards with a unique digital number for each eligible citizen. The number can track not only the individual but also the person’s activities and movements. This project has various components. First is data collection. It has two categories—demographic data, such as the names of father, mother and other family members. Second is biometric data—fingerprints, eye retina and digital signature. The biometric data is crucial to create a unique identity of each individual and avoid duplication in the integrated national database. The National ID has these two types of data. The other tasks are enrollment of the data, printing and distribution of the cards and then providing services based on that. At present, people carry multiple cards in their pockets. The objective of this project is to replace all of them by a single card–National ID. The new card includes vital details of all other cards in its chip with 1GB storage capacity. The government wanted to trace people based on their unique individual numbers so that there is no need to print and carry multiple cards. There is a huge industry of printing separate cards for each and every service that is creating a jumble of information. The National ID will not only replace multiple cards but also help authorities control criminal activities like financial frauds by removing duplication. At present, government authorities have difficulty in tracing and identifying an individual and wrongdoers are benefitting from that situation.What cards will be replaced by the National ID?It has a chip with 1GB storage capacity where you can store your driving license, academic documents, voting card, insurance details, ATM card number, etc. For instance, if you go to a telecom company to acquire a SIM card, they will ask for a copy of your citizenship card. You can say, ‘no, I have a National ID card’. Once you give your number and fingerprint, they can immediately verify it through the system. Another objective is to help people get rid of filling up pages of forms for each service. International governance has a norm that says don’t ask citizens their information more than once. A state agency should seek the information once and provide it to other state agencies if they require it. People complain that many agencies don’t accept National ID. They still ask for a citizenship card for official record and verification. So, in practice, it didn’t help people reduce the number of cards in their pockets. In fact, it added one more.Therefore, the June 6 Cabinet decision made the use of National ID cards compulsory in 28 districts. Now, it is going to be essential to get social security allowances, pensions and claim health insurance. The Health Insurance Board has said it has become challenging for them to verify whether a claimant is the rightful one. The board has 8 million policyholders. We will give them our details. Then, they can cross-check the authenticity of a claimant. This will help avoid huge financial frauds. In fact, the government should have made it mandatory earlier.But people including lawmakers in the federal parliament have strongly opposed the decision saying that the government made National ID mandatory without first distributing the cards to the people.Nepal’s total population is over 30 million. Our principal stakeholders are citizenship card holders. Those 16-year-olds are eligible for citizenship cards. The Election Commission distributes voting cards to those above 18 years. We got the data from the commission and added 20 percent and estimated that we have 18.6 people above 16 years old. As of Friday, we have already distributed the National ID numbers to 14.9 million people. Now, as per our estimate, around 3.7 million people are yet to get the National ID. Millions of people are abroad. Thus, we are headed towards saturation point in terms of data collection and issuance of the numbers. One thing I want to stress is that people don’t need a hard copy of the National ID card. The number is sufficient. Printing cards is costly. We have to pay around 2 euro to procure a blank card. The cost of printing, delivery and other overhead expenses is added to that. With the task of printing over a billion copies of ID cards being too costly, even India discourages use of hard copy of the cards. You can create the QR code of your card, save it in your mobile or print it in a paper and scan it wherever you need it.Officials at our government agencies bring up the rule that makes it mandatory to present a physical copy of citizenship card or other documents for official works.Yes, we are trained and habituated in that way. Now we need to change. We must make offices paperless while developing a strong database system. We have been using citizenship cards to verify the identity of a person for a long time. Biometrics not only helps identify people but also trace their activities. Recently, Rs2 billion was found in the bank accounts of a 26-year-old man. The money was deposited in 56 bank accounts. He used 13 ATM cards and 17 phone numbers. Once the National ID card is implemented, transactions and movements of such wrongdoers will be easily traced and monitored. Identifying individuals accurately is crucial to ensure good governance and strengthen security. Many people have acquired fake citizenship cards. People even made fake passports. Implementation of National ID will control it. It is also related to our national image. It will help improve the status of our passport and add authenticity to our other documents as well.Once the National ID comes into wide use, our details will be traced and used by multiple agencies. State agencies and other institutions benefit from the integrated database as they can easily trace us. But how do you ensure our data isn’t misused and it doesn’t make us insecure?If you have a National ID card, you don’t need a hard copy of your driving licence. There is a backlog of around 2.1 million licences. The government has failed to print and distribute them. We told them, we have already procured 12 million cards. Of them, 3.2 million cards have already been printed and we still need to print around 8 million cards. Once the licence data is integrated with the National ID card, it will be shown there. Now, to come to your question, only the traffic authority can access the licence-related data. The device they use will trace only relevant data. Only an authorised agency will get access to the data and it can’t be used for anything other than the stated purpose. We give access to agencies like Nepal Rastra Bank, Nepal Telecommunication Authority and Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal. Then they regulate the things in their domain. No unauthorised body or individual can access it. Do the implementing agencies have infrastructure to use this technology?We are in a position to implement it in some parts of the country. Therefore, we are implementing it in phases. We are making it mandatory for certain services in 28 districts from mid-July. We should have started much earlier. It must be expedited.Lawmakers said in a Parliament meeting that the decision has ‘terrorised people’ in the 28 districts as locals feared they might be deprived of the services as the government has made National ID cards mandatory without first distributing them.We started the National ID registration process from 2018. Registration teams reached in each local ward except in Mugu and Humla districts of Karnali. It was carried out as a campaign. Even after the drive’s completion, the registration process was open in all the 77 districts, 54 area administration offices and in palika (local unit) centres. We also had registration centres in major downtowns. We receive data of around 4,000 registrations a day. So, there has been sufficient initiative and enough time to encourage people to get the number. Besides, if anyone in the 28 districts are still to get the ID number, they still have three months to register.You said only an ID number but no hard copy was needed to access any kind of service, right?Exactly. There is no provision that states one should produce a hard copy to get any service. You give the number and your biometrics to verify that you are the right person. Then, the official can crosscheck it in the database within seconds.Do all the implementing agencies have the devices that read the National ID cards?We have distributed 4,200 machines that read the cards in 333 local units of the 28 districts. Likewise, we have asked other local units and districts and some agencies such as banks to procure the devices and we have given the specifications based on their requirements. A device costs just around Rs 1,500. You can enter the number and place your thumbprint on it. We have trained relevant officials from all the local units for the purpose.How many cards can the department print at present?We can produce 1,500 cards an hour. But now we are producing only 1,800 a day. We have the strength to distribute 30,000 cards a day but are distributing only 5,000 a day.Again the same question. Then why are people not getting the cards?There is some communication gap. People who registered in 2018 or 2019 haven’t contacted us. We are giving them priority to clear the backlogs. But people who are newly-registered are showing more interest. So, we need to strike the right balance.When will the department be in a position to distribute the cards to all the people?At present, we can print 100,000 cards a month. We have a space to double the capacity. Meanwhile, people have now shown more interest. By enhancing our facilities’ capacity, we can print the pending 8 million cards in the next 40 months.What about election cards? Do we need to register for that and get the voting cards?In fact, the Election Commission doesn’t need to collect data and issue cards. We will talk to them. As a constitutional body, we have to readily make the data available for them. In fact, the National ID Card system can help the commission make voting arrangements for the Nepalis abroad because it can accurately identify the right person and can immediately update the integrated system here in Nepal about the votes cast in any country. This card will be helpful in conducting fair elections because the biometric data stored in this system will be perfect bases to identify the people and instantly update the activities in the database.You have emphasised replacement of other cards by the National ID cards. How long may it take to do so?We plan on giving priority to three sectors—banking, civil aviation and telecom. People right now need to fill separate forms for these services that have irked the service seekers. We have asked the bankers to buy the devices. We as a supplier are ready. Now the stakeholders should be ready too. It will benefit them because it helps control frauds.What if I don’t register for the National ID card?In the first place, you will be deprived of social security funds, pension, insurance policies. Likewise, the government will gradually make the card compulsory to receive many other services such as driving licence, land transaction, telephone numbers, bank accounts. How do you assure that our data stored in this system isn’t misused?See, the current practices make you more vulnerable. Because multiple agencies take your data for various purposes. Do they have a system to protect the data and ensure that it isn’t misused? But when your data is stored only by a dedicated government agency, it will be more secure as the agency is specialised for that. When other authorised agencies seek data, we give them access only to the relevant one. We have a National Identity Management Information System (NIMIS). We have maintained three layers of security—L1, L2, L3—to ensure foolproof security of the data. There are three servers.Are we dependent on any foreign company for any related service?So far, only one international vendor is involved but we are cutting down its involvement as well, with a plan to ultimately replace it by our own agency. The vendor now helps transfer collected data to the printing machine through the Automated Biometric Identification System (ABIS). But our plan is to do so through our own government agency or local vendor. We do all the other tasks. Security printing is done within the office basement where every movement of people is monitored and recorded. \nThe weather across the country is forecast to be generally cloudy on Wednesday.Light to moderate rain accompanied by thunder and lightning is expected in several parts of Koshi Province, Bagmati Province, Karnali Province and Gandaki Province, as well as at one or two places in the rest of the provinces.The meteorological forecasting division has warned of heavy rainfall in some parts of Gandaki, Bagmati and Karnali provinces.Tonight, the weather is expected to remain generally cloudy throughout the country, with light to moderate rainfall.Likewise, moderate rain with thunder and lightning is likely to occur at some places in Gandaki Province, Lumbini Province, Karnali Province and Sudur Pashchim Province, as well as at one or two places in the rest of the provinces.Heavy rainfall is expected at one or two places in Koshi, Lumbini, and Sudur Pashchim provinces.The maximum temperature on Tuesday was recorded at 36.7 degrees Celsius in Dhangadi, while Jomsom’s lowest recorded temperature was 16.0 degrees Celsius. \nThe weather across the country is forecast to be generally cloudy on Tuesday.Light to moderate rain accompanied by thunder and lightning is expected in several parts of Bagmati Province, Gandaki Province and Lumbini Province, as well as at one or two places in the rest of the provinces.The meteorological forecasting division has warned of heavy rainfall in some parts of Gandaki Province.Tonight, the weather is expected to remain generally cloudy throughout the country, with light to moderate rainfall.Likewise, moderate rain with thunder and lightning is likely to occur at some places in Bagmati Province Karnali Province, Sudur Pashchim Province, and Gandaki Province, as well as at one or two places in the rest of the provinces.Heavy rainfall is expected at one or two places in Koshi, Bagmati, Sudur Pashchim and Gandaki provinces.The maximum temperature on Monday was recorded at 36.4 degrees Celsius in Janakpur, while Jomsom’s lowest recorded temperature was 15.5 degrees Celsius. \nThe weather across the country is forecast to be partly to generally cloudy today.
