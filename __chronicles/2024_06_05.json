In the story cover all the events as much as possible, try to weave them together, making a beautiful story.\n    Be elaborative as possible. I need more text. Text only no title or headings. Write it in the form of inspiring story not news article or event.\n    \n    Story:\nOnce upon a time, nestled between the towering peaks of the Himalayas and the lush jungles of the Terai, there was a country named Nepal. Though still a developing nation, Nepal was a land of profound beauty and deep-rooted cultural heritage. The residents of Nepal faced many challenges, but beneath these hardships lay a resilient spirit and an unyielding hope for the future.\n\nThis enchanting land, where Mount Everest reaches towards the skies and the air carries a mix of incense and cool mountain breezes, was more than a geographical marvel. It was a mosaic of cultures, languages, and traditions, a testament to human endeavor against all odds. Nepal's history, from the unification under King Prithvi Narayan Shah to its transformation into a federal democratic republic, told a story of aspiration and endurance.\n\nIn recent years, the people of Nepal, with their indomitable will, had taken strides towards rebuilding and reimagining their country. They turned their struggles into stepping stones, each challenge a chapter in their ongoing saga. The shift from a monarchy to a republic had not only changed governance but had woven a new tapestry of democratic values and collective decision-making.\n\nEconomically, while agriculture continued to sustain a large part of its population, Nepal had begun to harness the potential of its picturesque landscapes, developing sustainable tourism that promised to preserve their natural heritage while boosting local economies. Communities living in the shadows of the Himalayas had become stewards of the earth, protecting the biodiversity that made their country unique.\n\nEach day brought new stories. Whether it was a festival in Kathmandu, a technological advance in Pokhara, or a conservation effort in Chitwan, these events were threads in the vibrant quilt of Nepali life. These stories, updated daily, reflected the pulse of progress and the spirit of hope that characterized this resilient nation.\n\nAnd so, as Nepal moved forward, each moment was not just a passage of time but a promise of potential, a narrative of a nation perennially climbing towards tomorrow, guided by the legacy of its past and the dreams of its future.\n\nNews events:\nNepal lost their T20 World Cup opener to the Netherlands by six wickets, despite Rohit Paudel's 35-run knock and Max O'Dowd's 54* for the victors.\nPrime Minister Dahal plans a Cabinet reshuffle, considering replacements from coalition partners and potentially adding new faces from Nagarik Unmukti and Janamat parties, but faces resistance from the UML and Unified Socialist over a full ministerial change.\nExtreme heat in Nepal's Tarai region disrupts nationwide polio vaccination campaign for children born between April 2016 and October 2018, with officials expecting resumption after schools reopen and monsoon provides relief.\nPrime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal inaugurated the breakthrough of the Arun III Hydroelectric Project's headrace tunnel, marking the completion of a major milestone in the largest hydroelectric project in Nepal, which aims to provide clean energy and contribute to the economic development of the region.\nThe Supreme Court set June 26 as the verdict date for a writ petition challenging the government's decision to halt an investigation against former parliament speaker Agni Sapkota, accused of murdering Arjun Lama during the Maoist insurgency.\nOver a week after its formation, the parliamentary committee to investigate the misuse of public funds by various cooperatives has started drafting its working procedure necessary to commence the probe.The first meeting of the parliamentary panel on Wednesday tasked the officials of the Parliament Secretariat deputed at the committee to draft the working procedure by Thursday.“Our meeting on Friday will endorse the working procedure after reviewing the draft by the officials,” Ishwari Neupane, a member of the committee from the Nepali Congress, told the Post. “We will probably start the investigation from Sunday.”After weeks of negotiations between the ruling and the opposition parties, a seven-member committee under the leadership of CPN-UML lawmaker Surya Thapa was constituted on May 28 to investigate the embezzlement of deposits in dozens of cooperatives around the country.According to police investigations, billions of rupees from several cooperatives were transferred to the GB Rai-led Gorkha Media Network. He has fled the country, and Interpol has issued a diffusion notice against him.The committee is tasked with investigating credit cooperatives whose deposits were transferred to run the Gorkha Media Network and other organisations. \nMadhesh Chief Minister Saroj Kumar Yadav lost the position on Wednesday, 17 months after his appointment, after failing to secure the vote of confidence during the floor test in the provincial assembly.A meeting of the provincial assembly rejected the motion tabled by the chief minister seeking the trust of the assembly.Assembly Speaker Ramchandra Mandal announced that only 50 members of the assembly voted in favour of his motion while 53 voted against the chief minister. A total of 103 members were present at the meeting. In the 107-strong Madhesh Province, the support of 54 assembly members is required for a majority.Yadav, provincial assembly leader of the Janata Samajbadi Party-Nepal, which is led by Upendra Yadav, was appointed as the chief minister on January 11, 2023.The Yadav-led provincial government lost the majority after the CPN-UML and CPN (Maoist Centre) withdrew their support on May 12.The chief minister went for the floor test as per the mandatory provision of the constitution. This mandatory provision requires a chief minister to pass a floor test within 30 days if the party the chief minister represents splits or a coalition partner withdraws its support to the head of the provincial government.Earlier, Chief Minister Yadav had planned to defer the trust vote. He had requested the assembly reschedule the meeting for Monday, citing health reasons. However, he later became ready to face the assembly over fear of losing the position ‘automatically’. Leaders from rival parties had said that he would lose the position based on the date of the split of the JSP-Nepal. Last month, a group of leaders split the JSP-Nepal to form a new party under the leadership of Ashok Rai. The Election Commission recognised the Ashok Rai-led splinter group as a new party–Janata Samajbadi Party–on May 5. Then, the chief minister had become ready to secure a trust vote by today.There were also legal questions over the requirement as the Supreme Court has ordered the election body to halt the party registration process for the time being.Now, Province Chief Sumitra Bhandari will make a call for a government formation in accordance with Article 168(2) of the Constitution. The provision states that in cases where no party has a clear majority in the assembly under clause(1), the Province Head shall appoint as the chief minister a member of the assembly who can command a majority with the support of two or more parties representing the provincial assembly.The new chief minister will be required to secure the confidence of the provincial assembly within 30 days of the appointment.The Janata Samajbadi Party has been ousted from power six and a half years after the first provincial assembly elections. Previously, Lal Babu Raut of the party served a full five-year term.  \nNepal’s dairy farmers are facing renewed hardships with the government repeatedly failing to heed them. These farmers have asked for nothing more than the amount (around Rs5 billion) owed to them by private dairy companies since last August. For the same reason, the dairy farmers were compelled to spill milk in a March protest before reaching an agreement with three private dairy companies, the state-owned Dairy Development Cooperation (DDC) and the Ministry of Agriculture, to clear the payments by April 3. But all their effort went in vain, prompting them to plan yet another protest if their dues were not settled in the next two weeks.The plight of dairy farmers suggests utter neglect of this vital sector. Be it vegetable producers, sugarcane growers or dairy farmers, inadequate plans and policies to address their demands have left the farmers struggling. Reduced income has hit all aspects of the economy, and consumers are unable to buy dairy products. Even the sweltering heat, which would usually boost the demand for dairy products, has failed to do so. The government’s failure to address the core problem of the economy has had a significant impact on consumers and has spilled over to farmers.Market insiders have noted that the Pushpa Kamal Dahal-led government, without conducting proper market study, hiked the price of milk in March last year: Rs9.1 per litre in the minimum purchase price of raw milk paid to farmers, bringing the price up to Rs65.5. Following that, in the same month, DDC also set the price of half-litre milk at Rs48.50, by raising Rs5.50. However, this price is still high in Nepali market, leading many to import from the southern neighbour India. As a result, while Nepal produces over six million litres of milk a day with roughly 300,000 homes contributing, between 500,000 and 600,000 million litres go unsold due to the lack of market, as per the government’s economic survey (2023-24). The dairy farmers thus got no benefit from the price hike. The dairy companies, citing the economic crisis, don’t appear to have taken significant steps to solve this problem. They claim that their capacity to store butter is already exhausted, and they haven’t been able to buy milk and pay the farmers. During vital periods like these, the companies should have adequate storage systems to retain dairy products for high-demand times like Dashain and Tihar, explore international markets, and find new ways to attract consumers at home through quality dairy products. Additionally, the Central Dairy Cooperative Association—a key player in knocking the doors of the government to pay the rightful amount to the farmers—is yet to finalise measures to clear outstanding dues. It is not known why the government and private dairy companies haven’t settled the issue. Farmers who end up throwing milk on roads but fail to understand the demand-supply fluctuation are also to blame. Cooperatives and government authorities should work together to educate and encourage farmers to adopt agricultural insurance schemes, which cover 80 percent of the government subsidy. As an immediate measure, it is the state’s prime duty to pay attention to the farmers’ woes. Clearing the outstanding dues of Rs5 billion shouldn’t be much of a hassle considering that the sector contributes around five percent to the country’s gross domestic product.  \nThree populist parliamentarians—Oli, Lamichhane, and Shahi—manipulate popular sentiment to advance their political agendas, with Oli relying on cultural rhetoric, Lamichhane exploiting public discontent, and Shahi inciting anti-establishment sentiment.\nFossil fuels are being rapidly displaced by decarbonised sources of energy but not everyone is yet onboard. The resolution adopted at the end of COP28 last December was described as the \"beginning of the end\" for the fossil fuel era. While such an announcement was met with much cynicism, maybe it was indeed the turning point.The past six months have provided even more evidence that fossil fuels are being rapidly overcome by the new technologies of decarbonisation: Wind, solar, batteries and electric vehicles. These are now growing at super exponential rates showing that businesses, governments and communities are learning how to implement them in cities and regions.All fossil fuels are either plateauing or showing negative growth. The peaks for coal, oil and gas show how rapid their decline will be. The responses from the fossil fuel lobby have been largely of derision and instead of showing that they are in decline and must diversify into these new technologies, they have opted for even bigger growth targets.Many oil and gas projects are showing growth targets beyond 2050 into 2070, in a bid to find finance from a world that is more and more backing the net zero-only finance option as demand for fossil fuels declines.Fossil fuel lobby sows confusionThis is causing political chaos as governments are caught between supporting climate action and supporting big fossil fuel companies promising massive investment. This confuses the public. Australia is an example.In the two years since its election, the federal Labor government has created many innovative programs and funds to enable the energy transition. But at the same time it is backing oil and gas project expansion that is seven times more climate-damaging than the gains in climate mitigation from the other programs.Chevron's carbon capture and storage project at the Gorgon gas field—the biggest demonstration of the technology in the world—has failed to meet its targets, casting doubt on the continued use of gas.Overviews of the technology are increasingly casting doubts on its commercial viability. Due to their impact on the global climate it is hard to see more than a small fraction of the fossil fuel projects ever getting their finance. It’s thus likely the fossil fuel lobby strategy to push ahead—as though COP28 never happened—will begin to collapse. It's expected that COP29 will confirm the support for a rapid decline in fossil fuels.Risk of COP29 backfiringLike COP28 it will be convened by an oil and gas-based nation. But the data are beginning to make the campaigns for more fossil fuels look like childish tantrums. And the natural world has been fighting back with the climate causing severe storms like the huge floods that hit Dubai in the months after COP28. No place is safe from global warming.Finance will have the major stake as they must invest in returns that last into the 2050s and these are increasingly threatened by the data trends and the climate itself.The Australian oil and gas company Woodside had 58 percent of its shareholders vote down the company's climate strategy, including its dependence on carbon capture and storage. COP29 will backfire unless more is agreed to accelerate the phase out of fossil fuels.Fossil fuel companies will increasingly find that unless they seriously join the diversification of their investments, they will disappear.The examples of Orsted in Denmark and Neste in Finland have demonstrated diversification to renewable-based fuels is commercially feasible by companies that previously worked on fossil fuels. Much more is needed and can be expected at COP29.UN climate chief Simon Stielle has put the world on notice: \"We've got two years left to save the planet. As we inch towards the point of no return, each year takes on more importance than the last.\" But the first steps were taken at COP28 by recognising that the era of fossil fuels is over. \nChiefs and deputy chiefs of over 150 local units from across the country have gathered in Kathmandu for a common agenda—to protest against the federal government’s decision to cut the budget already allocated to them. They picketed the finance ministry at Singha Durbar on Sunday to mount pressure on the federal government to release the money. According to them, the budget earmarked under the title of equalisation grants was not distributed as earlier promised. Local units get the equalisation grants in three tranches. They were entitled to 25 percent of the total grants in the third instalment, but they got only seven percent. According to elected local representatives, the federal administration’s act of cutting the allocated budget has caused them multiple problems as they had initiated several development projects and other activities with a plan to pay with the money from the equalisation grants. With the abrupt disruption of the source, they are now in a spot of bother. The finance ministry might have its own arguments behind stopping the budget, most likely a shortfall of resources as successive governments have failed to rejuvenate the country’s economy after the covid pandemic. The Pushpa Kamal Dahal government has been a failure on the economic front as it couldn’t even meet the target of revenue collection set in the annual budget. Nepali authorities have failed to apply any innovative idea or explore new resources to fill the gap. The authorities in Kathmandu could have found other ways such as applying austerity measures at the centre so as to avoid budget cuts to the local units. For one, cutting local units’ budgets won’t help the government’s goal of increasing capital expenditures.There are several options to fund development and other activities at the district, constituency and local levels. Allocation of the budget through equalisation grants is one. It is a more scientific and rational way of resource distribution as it is done in line with clear working procedures of the National Natural Resources and Finance Commission. The latest status of human development indicators including the situation of education, health and drinking water of a particular local unit or province; the situation of balanced development there; that of disparity based on economic, social or any other discrimination; the condition of infrastructure in the province and local units; the existing status and prospect of revenue generation; and the need of expenditure for the sub-national units are the criteria considered while allocating funds.The commission also takes the population of a sub-national unit as a basis to allocate budget under this category. For instance, units with less than 10,000 people get Rs1.25 million while those with more than 10,000 and upto 2 million people get additional Rs125,000 for each 10,000 increment. This shows that distribution of money under equalisation grants is to an extent rational whereas several other programmes are infamous for doling out money based on recommendation and influence of powerful political leaders and top officials at Singha Durbar.By cutting resources to local units, the government is treading a regressive path by weakening sub-national administrations—at a time it needs to devolve more authorities and resources to strengthen them as per the spirit of the federal system. The local representatives, while speaking during the sit-in at the ministry, accused the authorities of shifting development and other responsibilities to the local units while centralising resources at Singha Durbar. They are right to say that such a tendency will neither strengthen the federal system nor does it sit well with the spirit of the new constitution.  \nExit polls could not accurately capture discontent among the social and economic castes that are ranked lower in India in key states, resulting in an overestimation of electoral support for Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s ruling party, two pollsters said.The findings led to turmoil in Indian stock markets on Tuesday, after rosier projections for Modi in the general election earlier boosted markets.Three of five polls initially projected Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party would win more than the 303 electoral seats it won in 2019, while the opposition “INDIA” alliance led by Rahul Gandhi’s Congress party would win 125 to 182 seats.The predictions boosted financial markets ahead of the release of elections results on Tuesday.However, vote counts showed much lower numbers - around 240 for the BJP and 293 for Modi’s alliance that includes regional parties. That caused the worst intraday fall in stocks since March 2020 on concerns over challenges for implementing economic reforms due to Modi’s dependence on allies.Pradeep Gupta, head of Axis My India poll agency, said the survey failed to capture a shift among voters in the less privileged sections of society in Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal and Maharashtra states, where 170 seats in total were up for grabs, and where BJP lost a whopping 45 seats, compared to 2019.“This is our mistake,” Gupta said.He noted many voters in those sections of society didn’t disclose their voting decisions for fear of being attacked by electoral workers who did not share their political views.“We could not predict as accurately as we are known for,” he said, referring to challenges in capturing how voters had swung in favour of the opposition from other regional parties.Over 900 people were deployed for face-to-face post-ballot interviews with a sample of 582,000 voters, with the response rate varying from 40-50% in urban areas and 70-80% in rural areas, Gupta said.Many women voters asked males in their families to respond on their behalf, resulting in wrong estimations of their voting decisions, he said.“We are wrong in 2024,” said Yashwant Deshmukh, head of CVoter polling agency, whose numbers were overestimated by about 50 seats in favour of Modi’s party amid incorrect projections for Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan.“I wish I could stop giving seat numbers but that’s a professional hazard” as the media keeps asking for those estimates, Deshmukh said. \nThe British Embassy in Kathmandu on Tuesday held an event to mark the centenary of the 1924 Mt Everest expedition.The British Embassy in Kathmandu said in a statement that a photo exhibition about the 1924 expedition was mounted at the embassy on Tuesday.Entitled ‘The Fight for Everest 1924,’ it was first displayed at the Kathmandu International Mountain Film Festival (Kimff) last week. The collection will be permanently displayed at the Pokhara-based International Mountain Museum.Speaking at the event at the embassy, Ambassador Rob Fenn commented that, although the 1924 expedition had not come to Kathmandu, Nepalis played an important role in it and “have continued to be pivotal in Everest attempts since.”“Britons are besotted with raw courage. It’s what has been drawing us to Nepal and to Nepalis for more than two hundred years,” he said.Ambassador Fenn shared news announced in the UK in December that Nepalis are now eligible to apply for expedition funding from the UK-based Mount Everest Foundation (www.mef.org.uk/news/mef-opens-grants-to-nepali-applicants). Since its inception in 1955, the MEF has provided funds to over 2,000 expeditions in remote locations and to scientists researching high-altitude medicine, glaciology and climate change. \nPrime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal, Nepali Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba and CPN-UML chair KP Sharma Oli have congratulated Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi for the third-term victory of Modi’s party in the 2024 elections.Dahal took to X to ‘note the successful completion of the world’s largest democratic exercise with the enthusiastic participation of the people of India’ as Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party won 240 seats in the 543-member lower house.The BJP-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) secured 293 seats, more than 20 ahead of the 272 needed to form a government.“Congratulations to PM @narendramodi on the electoral success of BJP and NDA in the Loksabha elections for the third consecutive term,” reads the prime minister’s post.Congress President Deuba, who is also the leader of the main opposition, took to social media X to congratulate the Indian prime minister. “Congratulations to @narendramodi ji, a great friend of Nepal, on securing a third consecutive term as Prime Minister of India following the BJP and NDA's victory,” former prime minister Deuba wrote on Wednesday. “Your leadership, dedication, and vision continue to inspire and shape a bright future for India.”Likewise, CPN-UML chair KP Sharma Oli joined the leaders to greet the Indian leader. “I congratulate the Indian people for their great democratic exercise. I wish for your continued success in driving India’s progress and prosperity,” former prime minister Oli said on X. \nA man attempted self-immolation in Kathmandu after allegedly setting his own family on fire on Tuesday.According to Deputy Superintendent of Police Keshav Thebe, 55-year-old Chanchal Bahadur Singh, in an inebriated state, sprinkled kerosene over his wife Bindu, and their three daughters, aged 24, 16 and eight, and set them on fire in Saraswatinagar of Chabahil.Singh then attempted self-immolation, police said.All of them have been admitted to the Kirtipur Hospital for treatment.The 24-year-old and the teenager have been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) as they have sustained 55 percent and 80 percent burns to their bodies, respectively.The others have sustained eight to 10 percent burn wounds, the hospital said. \nIsraeli shelling and airstrikes killed at least 19 people in central and south Gaza on Tuesday including two policemen who were helping protect humanitarian aid deliveries in the southern city of Rafah, Palestinian medics said.Seventeen of the deaths, they said, occurred in separate Israeli airstrikes on the al-Bureij and al-Maghazi refugee camps and the city of Deir-al-Balah in central Gaza, and by late Tuesday tanks were shelling an area just east of the al-Nusseirat camp, residents said.Some told Reuters via chat app that the renewed Israeli military push was sowing panic, with some families living in al-Maghazi starting to flee under tank fire, with four shells crashing near a clinic in the camp.In a brief statement issued earlier in the day, the Israeli military said jets were hitting Hamas militant targets in central Gaza while ground forces were operating “in a focused manner with guidance from intelligence” in the al-Bureij area.It gave no update on activity in Rafah, into which Israeli forces swept last month in what the military calls a limited operation to root out Hamas’ last intact combat units after almost eight months of devastating war in the Gaza Strip.The small city fringing Gaza’s southern border with Egypt had been sheltering about one million Palestinians who fled Israeli assaults in other parts of the enclave, but most have fled again in the face of Israel's tank-led advance.Israel launched an air and ground offensive in Gaza last October vowing to destroy Hamas after militants stormed across the border into southern Israel on October 7, killing around 1,200 people and taking more than 250 people hostage, according to Israeli tallies. About 120 hostages remain in Gaza.The Israeli military campaign has killed more than 36,000 people in densely populated Gaza, according to its health authorities, who say thousands more bodies are buried under rubble.Qatar said on Tuesday it had delivered an Israeli ceasefire proposal to Hamas that reflected a three-phase proposal presented on Friday by US President Joe Biden, and that the paper was now much closer to the positions of both sides.Qatar, which has been mediating on Gaza between Israel and Hamas, also stressed that there should be a clear position from both parties to clinch a deal, its foreign ministry spokesperson said in a press briefing.“The ceasefire deal should immediately end the long suffering of all people in Gaza and the hostages and their families and provide a roadmap for a permanent ceasefire and an end to the (humanitarian) crisis”, Majed al-Ansari said.However, a spokesman for Hamas, the Islamist militant group that has ruled Gaza since 2007, reiterated on Tuesday it could not agree to any deal unless Israel makes a “clear” commitment to a permanent truce and complete withdrawal from Gaza.For his part, Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu repeated that there can be no permanent peace unless Hamas is eradicated, as he struggles with profound political divisions at home over the US-backed truce proposal.An aide to Netanyahu said on Sunday Israel had accepted the framework advanced by Biden, though he described it as flawed and in need of much more work.On Tuesday, his biggest coalition partner said it would support such a deal even if it entails an overhaul of the war strategy. But Netanyahu’s far-right allies in the government threatened to bolt and bring it down if he wound down the Gaza war without having annihilated Hamas.Biden’s framework proposal involves in its first stage a six-week ceasefire when Israeli forces would withdraw from “all populated areas” of Gaza and some hostages - including the elderly and women - would be freed by Hamas in exchange for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners.Under that plan, Hamas and Israel would negotiate in the same phase a permanent ceasefire that Biden said would last “as long as Hamas lives up to its commitments.”In the second phase, Biden said there would be an exchange for all remaining living hostages, including male soldiers, Israeli forces would withdraw from Gaza and the permanent ceasefire would begin. The last stage of the plan would include the reconstruction of the shattered coastal enclave.Biden’s Middle East envoy, Brett McGurk, will travel to the region this week to push for a hostage deal and ceasefire, a US official told Reuters on Tuesday. \nIndian Prime Minister Narendra Modi was set to meet his allies on Wednesday to discuss forming the government, a day after his Hindu nationalist party lost its outright majority in parliament in a surprise election verdict.Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) won 240 seats on its own in the general election, 32 short of the halfway mark in the 543-member decision-making lower house, according to official results announced late on Tuesday.The outcome unnerved investors, with stocks falling steeply on Tuesday, since Modi would have to depend on disparate regional parties whose political loyalties have wavered over the years.The National Democratic Alliance (NDA) led by the BJP won 293 seats, more than 20 ahead of the 272 needed to form a government.The opposition INDIA alliance led by Rahul Gandhi’s centrist Congress party won 230 seats, more than forecast. Congress alone won 99, almost double the 52 it won in 2019 - a surprise jump that is expected to boost Gandhi's standing.The INDIA alliance was also expected to meet on Wednesday in New Delhi, and discuss a future course of action.But any efforts at government formation by the opposition were likely stymied by two of the BJP’s key allies endorsing Modi and saying their pre-poll alliance with the party was intact.Addressing a crowd of cheering party workers at the party headquarters late on Tuesday evening, Modi promised to work harder in his third term.“The blessings of the people for the third time after 10 years boosts our morale, gives new strength,” he said.TURNOUT TROUBLEModi was seeking one of India’s biggest mandates in the six-week-long election after most opinion polls conducted before voting began had predicted a big victory for him, driven by his personal popularity, free cereal for the poor, new roads and bridges, and his courting of majority Hindus.But a fall in voter turnout in the first stage of the seven- phase election worried the BJP, several party officials said. A pollster, who declined to be named citing private conversations, said he got calls from “panicked” BJP officials asking if “something was going wrong. Why aren’t people coming?”.At the same time, some analysts told TV debates that opposition attempts to woo the masses with promises of affirmative action, bigger handouts and more jobs were gaining traction.That is when Modi changed tack.Having earlier focused on economic development, India's image and such issues, he switched back to accusing the opposition of favouring minority Muslims at the cost of Hindus.“I believe that the polarising campaign that the prime minister ran this time, the kind of, you know, hyped-up media outreach that he did, I think these were all signs that he was worried,” said political commentator Arati Jerath.The BJP said Modi was their best bet to put their message across.“We discussed internally how our work, economic development, India’s global image and such things sometimes do not set the narrative,” said spokesperson Agarwal.“The politics is such that other things dictate the narrative, and the BJP must also respond accordingly. For our narrative to work, the prime minister is the best communicator.”However, with the BJP falling short of a majority on its own, its promises like a uniform civil code for all religions, opposed by some Muslims, and simultaneous state and national elections, will likely be put on the back burner. They could be replaced by policies aimed at more bread-and-butter issues as its allies could demand.“Modi has seemingly lost his aura of electoral invincibility,” said Michael Kugelman, director of the Washington-based Wilson Center's South Asia Institute think tank.“He remains highly popular, and his party likely would have done even worse if he weren’t leading it. This is a leader who has repeatedly bounced back from political and policy setbacks and retained large public mandates. With the results we’re seeing today, that narrative of resilience has been dealt a big blow.” \nThese days, I watch Nepali television news more frequently and read broadsheet papers and online news to observe the clash of dreams and reality, particularly in political events. The uncanny political developments in the country have propelled the speed of these events. Little worried by the indications of the erosion of the hard-earned democratic values and practices seen in political coalitions and the assault on media freedom, I briefly review the history of political leaders' dreams and failures in this column. I want to show that we, the people, bear the brunt of history’s tragic and farcical turns. An important shift has occurred in Nepali history from the tragic to the ludicrous. Karl Marx, in his famous work The Eighteenth Brumaire Of Louis Bonaparte, said, \"All the great events and characters of history occur twice, firstly as tragedy, secondly as farce.\" No communist leaders of Nepal appear to have referred to this book and Marx's prophetic statement except Baburam Bhattarai, the erstwhile Maoist leader and comrade of the current Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal, who has recently got the vote of confidence for the fourth time in 17 months. This is an interesting episode of political farce. Political parties and the cronies who are always proactive are reducing the democratic system established by people's sacrifice and dedication to a farce. That becomes clear if we watch the drama that happens in Parliament.There is a serious part to this historical shift. Marx also says, \"The social revolution of the nineteenth century cannot create its poetry from the past but only from the future”. This means that to draw strength and meaning from the past, you should create its poetry from the future. This is a little academic point. Repetition of historyThe Nepali democracy and those who have been given the responsibility to protect and use it precisely lack that vision of futurity; they do not perceive the poetry of the future. Their actions in parliament, narrow partisan behaviours, the reckless language they use, inadequate knowledge about the political dynamics of social change and the important time they squander away by acting irresponsibly all show that they lack the vision to create poetry from the future. I have begun to wonder whether the Nepali political parties will fully utilise the democratic political system to ameliorate the condition of the people of this land.The Nepali media fraternity says the sudden arrest of Kantipur Media Group Chairman Kailash Sirohiya on May 21, 2024, is unfair and \"motivated by personal vendetta.\" The agency in question is the coalition government led by Dahal and the Home Ministry. A certain revelation occurred to me after watching an interview with Bhattarai on Kantipur television on the same night. Bhattarai recalled one article he published in Kantipur in August 2001 about the royal massacre. I was mourning my mother's death in my village, Sabala of Terathum. I read that article to my elder brother and Nepali Congress district leader, Laya Prasad Subedi, who totally agreed with Bhattarai's analysis. The underground Maoist leader Bhattarai has said in that article the murders were the result of a \"political conspiracy\". Kailash Sirohiya and his co-publisher, Binod Raj Gyawali, and the editor-in-chief of Kantipur, Yubaraj Ghimire, were arrested for publishing that. Bhattarai said in the interview that he was stunned by the drama of Sirohiya's arrest, which shows an uncanny repetition of history. This time, he said, “Prachanda is in the position of the king, and the same media person is arrested, as the common opinion says, for publishing news stories about Prachanda's government.” Bhattarai also revealed that in a prime ministerial system like ours, no such decision is taken without the prime minister's consent. It is not the minister but the prime minister who can make such decisions, he explained.Whatever the position of parties and the leaders at the current moment of history, those who have followed the political history know that Bhattarai has always made decisions according to his understanding, conscience and interpretation of history. Bhattarai had declared that he was leaving the Maoist party because, metaphorically, it was not safe to live in the red-labelled house, which was a category of the badly damaged buildings after the earthquakes of 2015. I am dismayed by the performances of Pushpa Kamal Dahal. I am getting more and more disillusioned by his actions and those of the other communist leaders of different groups who are all in the coalition now. They include communist stalwarts like Dahal, KP Sharma Oli and Madhav Kumar Nepal. There is no point in talking about the behaviour of the individual ministers, whose sense of history and the missions often don't come to the fore. The coalition’s leader and a major actor Dahal is at the centre of the decisions in this system if we believe the interpretation of the former prime minister Bhattarai.It is challenging for all political leaders to maintain a history of their choice and to live up to the expectations of the people. Dahal is no exception. I want to recall one event here. Dahal had attended the Hindustan Times Leadership Summit in Delhi in the third week of November 2006. Some people told me about him when I attended a literary conference in Delhi after that event. One professor, impressed with Dahal’s metamorphosis, gave me the news published in the paper. It cites Dahal saying, \"I have lived my life in jungle, now I will lead my life in light.\" Another report said, ''Nepal's firebrand Maoist leader Prachanda on Saturday said the political battle in the 21st century will be fought over democracy, which at present is in deep crisis.\" A euphoric Dahal, by his transformation, said while addressing the second session on the second day of the fourth Hindustan Times Leadership Summit in Delhi, \"Democracy will rule the world\". The report also said, \"The former Indian prime minister and admirer of Prachanda I. K. Gujaral says he had read about many epic stories about revolution and Prachanda has shown it by accomplishing an epic battle in Nepal.\"History says Dahal and other leaders have clearly failed to deliver. His and his various coalitions’ actions show that staying in power is their only goal. What has begun to worry nonpartisan academics and writers like us is that the power coalitions and groups only work with what Bertrand Russell calls the “lust for power.” The time has come for the free media, legal activists and civil society to be vigilant about protecting democracy.  \nThe Speaker of the House of Representatives is expected to run parliamentary proceedings impartially following democratic norms. In parliamentary tradition, after being elected, the Speaker dissociates himself or herself from the party that gave the election ticket to maintain neutrality.Speakers in Nepal, however, have often run into controversies. They have also been accused of failing to maintain neutrality while conducting parliamentary business. At times, they are accused of working at the behest of the mother party.The Speaker’s role becomes crucial in minimising inter-party rivalry that often leads to a political deadlock. Some Speakers such as Daman Nath Dhungana and Subas Nembang have successfully played that role as well.The incumbent Speaker Devraj Ghimire also faces the charge of failing to demonstrate an impartial role.On Saturday, Ghimire addressed a gathering organised by a provincial chapter of the Federation of Nepali Journalists where he said since Parliament had been held hostage, “some measures may need to be taken”. He went on to say that the government may be forced to introduce the fiscal budget through an ordinance should the House deadlock prolong.His controversial statement came ahead of political leaders’ consultations on the day as they tried to find a way out of the impasse. Soon afterwards, Ghimire attended a meeting convened by Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal with CPN-UML chair KP Sharma Oli, and Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Home Affairs Rabi Lamichhane, who is also the Rastriya Swatantra Party chief.The opposition leaders have fiercely criticised the Speaker mainly after the May 16 incident when the Congress and the UML lawmakers had a scuffle during the House meeting. A UML lawmaker, Ghimire formally disassociated himself from the party after being elected the Speaker in early 2023.Experts on parliamentary affairs say Speaker candidates must be picked carefully, analysing if they can do justice to the top position of the legislature. When the Speakers are selected on the basis of their relations with party leaders, they often take decisions to suit the leaders they are grateful to.Speaker is a crucial constitutional position, former Speaker Daman Nath Dhungana told the Post. But political parties often give the post to someone from the party so as to satisfy their aspirations.On May 15, UML chair Oli hinted that as Congress lawmakers had continuously been barring Home Minister Lamichhane from speaking in the House, the situation would be changed. Congress, the main opposition party, has been disrupting the House proceedings, demanding a parliamentary inquiry against Lamichhane in his alleged connections with cooperative funds embezzlement. \"It is unacceptable to us that only the Congress speaks in the meeting. Congress is not the only party in Parliament,” Oli said at the UML parliamentary party meeting on May 15. “Home Minister Lamichhane will speak at the parliament meeting tomorrow; if not, our party will speak.”The next day, Speaker Ghimire allowed Home Minister Lamichhane to go to the rostrum and make his statement while Congress lawmakers were already chanting slogans. Then the situation turned tense and resulted in a scuffle.Though Congress allowed President Ramchandra Paudel to present the government’s policies and programmes on May 14, it obstructed the motion to thank the head of state for the task, as per the parliamentary tradition.After the May 16 incident, Congress General Secretary Gagan Thapa criticised Speaker Ghimire for his role in Parliament. “Why did the Speaker take the House proceedings ahead forcefully when the main opposition was protesting?” Thapa said. “Whatever happened in the House is unfortunate, and the Speaker should bear the responsibility.” However, former Speaker Taranath Ranabhat, also a former general secretary of the Congress, does not agree with Thapa. Speakers should not be held squarely responsible for their role in Parliament, said Ranabhat.“Parliamentarians represent their parties, but the Speaker's role is like a referee,” Ranabhat told the Post. “When trying to bring everyone together, sometimes the Speaker might try to favour some parties to win their confidence which might be uncomfortable for others. However, the Speaker's role should not be questioned on that basis alone.”Earlier, the roles played by former Speakers Agni Prasad Sapkota and Krishna Bahadur Mahara—both from the Maoist Centre—became controversial too. Then-finance minister Janardan Sharma, a Maoist Centre leader, tabled the substitution bill related to budget ordinances in Parliament in September 2021, amid protests of the main opposition UML. Speaker Sapkota had allowed Sharma to table the bill amid obstruction from the UML.The UML also accused Speaker Sapkota of aiding the party’s split. The UML at the time had urged the Speaker to sack 14 UML lawmakers, who defected to form the CPN (Unified Socialist) under Madhav Kumar Nepal. However, the Speaker refused to formalise the UML’s decision. The UML persistently protested in Parliament demanding Sapkota’s resignation as Speaker.In January 2019, Speaker Mahara was accused of siding with the ruling party during the passage of the National Medical Education Bill, even though the Congress had contested some of the bill's clauses. Additionally, he came under fire for not allowing Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba to voice his opinion in the House before inviting then-prime minister Oli to speak on the contentious Guthi Bill. Ramchandra Paudel, a former Congress leader who became the Speaker after the 1996 midterm election, even faced impeachment for his role in Parliament. An impeachment motion was registered against him on September 23, 1998, for aiding the passage of a bill amid obstructions from the main opposition UML.In principle, the Speaker shouldn’t carry forward the House business even if a single parliamentarian raises his hand, says Hari Bahadur Thapa, a senior journalist who has followed Parliament for more than two decades.The Speaker has the right to marshal security personnel against a parliamentarian if they disrupt the House proceedings, but s/he cannot carry forward the House business when there is an obstruction, Thapa told the Post. \nThe current key financial indicators in Nepal are highly paradoxical and worrisome. According to the latest data released by the Nepal Rastra Bank, the central bank of Nepal, deposits in banks and financial institutions (BFIs) have crossed the Rs6.16 trillion mark, while credit disbursement is Rs5.12 trillion. These two figures are 108 and 92 percent of Nepal's estimated Rs5.7 trillion gross domestic product (GDP), respectively. This means that even after maintaining mandatory cash ratios with the central bank—which amounts to around Rs3.6 trillion in aggregate—about Rs6.5 trillion is available as loanable liquidity in the banking system. This, indeed, should have been a god-sent historical opportunity to catapult Nepal to the next level of economic activities and growth. Sadly, that does not seem to be on the anvil.Now, the loan uptake by the entrepreneurs and investors is very slow. The credit growth is 2 percent slower than the deposit growth. The effective interest rate is still in double digits, hovering between 10 to 12 percent. For small borrowers who generally rely on microfinance institutions and credit cooperatives, the cost of funds is at least 20 percent. High interest rate is apparently one of the key deterrents to potential borrowers. Also, a higher amount of deposit collection compared to loan disbursement is taking a toll on the profitability of the BFIs.On one hand, despite most BFIs’ favourable loanable liquidity position, they are unwilling to cut the interest rate for fear of a further decline in profitability. Such practices blatantly compromise the principle of price determination in a free and complete market based on the quantity of funds demanded and supplied. On the other hand, non-performing loans (NPL) of the BFIs are rapidly growing. The total NPL was 3.6 percent of the total loan disbursement last January, which has now risen to 4.8 percent. In nominal terms, approximately Rs250 billion worth of loans is slipping into the risky zone. As its obvious aftermath, the number of borrowers blacklisted for their default on timely repayment is reported to be about 200 per day. This inescapable trap to businesses is created due to the growing number of business closures and increasing financial losses in those businesses struggling to survive. Economy in recessionTechnically, a recession is defined as a decline in GDP growth for two consecutive quarters. However, to the great relief of the ruling political leaders and bureaucracy, Nepal does not produce quarterly GDP growth data. If the annual growth forecasts like the recent ones from the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank, which predicted Nepal's growth rate to be no more than 4 percent in 2024, are to be trusted, Nepal is clearly in a recessionary trajectory. Other disappointing trends in real income, industrial output, employment rate, wholesale and retail sales and overall service sector performance confirm that the economy went downhill in several successive quarters to arrive at this stage.Other rather subjective but evident recession traits are manifested in the form of pervasive plummeting of the consumers' confidence, investors' confidence, overall market confidence, and trust deficit on the incumbent government's sincerity as the principal agent supposed to work for the economic betterment of the country.The gapsThe economic revival looks challenging even in several years if the government fails to take bold countercyclical measures, mainly in revenue collection, capital expenditure and implementing fiscal federalism. And the monetary policy must improve corporate governance in the banking sector, which private sector players dominate by more than 90 percent. This is exactly where effective coordination between fiscal and monetary policies is indispensable.On the fiscal policy side, if the tax policy to find new revenue sources is not comprehensively recalibrated, the collected revenue, like in recent years, will continue to fall short of even meeting the current expenditures, let alone augmenting the capital expenditure and saving the country from default on sovereign debt servicing. The capital allocation in the federal budget is pathetic, persistently at less than 20 percent of total earmarks. Worse, the spending capacity has effectively come down to about 40 percent of even such a low allocation.Despite federalism devolving the constitutional authority to sub-national levels to devise 'their own' public procurement laws, timely completion of contractual procedures of the projects has been extremely tardy. The complications are added by the vested interests of the people in executive power in awarding contracts with apparent conflict of interest. When the government, as the single largest procurer, fails to spend its capital budget transparently, the cash flow in the financial market is bound to shrink. This has direct ramifications on the liquidity positions of the BFIs. The persistent failure of the governments at all three tiers to carry out the capital expenditure as outlined has a cumulative adverse impact.Trust the systemA sincere effort to put fiscal federalism into practice in the true spirit of the federal polity and state architecture will certainly solve several critical issues related to fiscal resource management at the provincial or municipal levels. For instance, reasonably effective management of the bond market at the centre helps generate resources for development expenditure. In allocation, the disbursement may be proportionate to the absorption capacity of an individual administrative unit like a ministry or a federal unit like a municipality. This would ameliorate a number of pending constraints faced by the entire financial system of the country. It is already too late to consider the legislation to empower competent municipalities to issue their own development bonds so as to enhance the fiscal policy independence of the local governments and increase the stakeholder ownership of the executed projects.To conclude, two critical steps are inevitable to rescue the economy from the brink of a deeper recession. One, a stimulus package with an amalgam of fiscal and monetary incentives is necessary. The business-as-usual budget will not solve new challenges to the economy, like the rapidly depleting base of state income. Two, the impending credit risk in BFIs will be far larger if the businesses are not put back on track by enabling them to unlock their full potential, now an existential threat due to the engulfing recession. \nSunday marked the seventh year of the signing of the Belt and Road Initiative between Nepal and China yet the two sides are still struggling to finalise the implementation plan of the BRI that China proposed in early 2020.Nepal and China signed a memorandum of understanding on the One Belt One Road, later known as BRI, a flagship initiative of Chinese President Xi Jinping, on May 12, 2017, subject to renewal every three years.Still, there is a divergence of views on whether Nepal needs a dedicated BRI implementation plan to execute the projects under the Chinese initiative, senior government leaders and officials told the Post. Hence there is no clarity over when and how the implementation plan will be signed.The draft titled “Implementation Plan on Jointly Building the Belt and Road Initiative between the Government of the People’s Republic of China and the Government of Nepal” is currently under the purview of the National Planning Commission for its redrafting/processing.There was a general understanding between Nepal and China to sign the BRI implementation plan during the China visit of Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal in September last year as well as during the visit of Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs, Narayan Kaji Shrestha, in March this year. But there was little progress on both the visits and the signing was indefinitely postponed.The draft of the BRI implementation plan is not ready yet, DPM Shrestha said. It is said to be in the final stage of completion. Shrestha says he tried to push the plan in his interactions with the Chinese side but there has been no progress.One senior government official told the Post that the elections in India are the primary reason the plan has not made headway in China.No sensitive decision that may hurt relations with India and China will be taken around election time, said an official at the prime minister’s office who is privy to the issue.Shrestha said that projects under the BRI will be selected only after the plan’s signing.“It is our position that we will select a new set of projects only after signing the BRI implementation plan,” Shrestha told the Post.Asked about the nine projects selected during the tenure of KP Sharma Oli as the prime minister in 2019-20, Shrestha said they now have only referential value.The text of the BRI implementation plan, which Nepal first received in early 2020 after Chinese President Xi Jinping’s Nepal visit, is a comprehensive document that outlines nine clusters: economic cooperation, agriculture, education, connectivity, trade, investment, tourism, culture, and people-to-people cooperation.It said that the two sides would identify projects, discuss the investment modality and the way to execute it. After several rounds of exchanging text and comments, the Chinese side in October 2021 sent their draft to the Sher Bahadur Deuba government.After Deuba became the prime minister, China’s State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi came to Nepal on an official visit. He then shared that Beijing has reservations over the financing modality of the projects to be undertaken under the BRI; Nepal had made it clear that it cannot afford loans with over 1 percent interest to implement the projects, and the country prioritised grants and concessional loans.“The country’s economic situation has not improved. We are not in a position to take loans from anywhere including China as they would increase pressure on the weak Nepali economy,” said an official at the Prime Minister’s Office.Amid the delays, China last year started the “Silkroad Roadster” in Nepal, focusing on some small-scale projects.Nepal gave continuity to its old position when Prime Minister Dahal visited China in September-October last year.“When the issue of BRI was discussed in Beijing during the prime minister’s trip, we told the Chinese authorities that we will sign the implementation plan at an ‘appropriate’ time,” former foreign minister NP Saud, a Nepali Congress leader, said. “We also conveyed to the Chinese officials and leaders that our preference is grant, not loan.”The Congress and other political parties have called for a national consensus on vital issues like the BRI or any other development or economic vehicle with far-reaching consequences for the country. Apart from the investment modality, Nepal also has reservations over a clause of the BRI implementation plan dealing with security concerns.A former minister familiar with the plan expresses reservations over the text handed over by the Chinese, which Nepal wants to amend before signing or avoid. The document’s sub-section 12 titled ‘Other Areas’ under section 3 named ‘Cooperation Priorities’ mentions that “the two sides will strengthen legal cooperation and actively carry out diverse legal exchanges and capacity building in order to facilitate B&R [belt and road] cooperation”.It also says “the two sides will implement relevant agreements on law enforcement cooperation and strengthen security cooperation through joint training, information exchange, and capacity building, including for disaster management”.Beijing accords the BRI top foreign policy priority. In every high-level visit and meeting between Nepal and China, the initiative gets traction.Although there is no clear provision on whether the two sides should renew the agreement by exchanging correspondence, officials at the finance ministry said that would be the diplomatically correct way to go about it.There are concerns over the BRI’s stalled momentum in Nepal. The initiative’s stated focus is connectivity, trade, development strategies, and policy dialogues for cooperation in the fields of economy, environment, technology and culture.The agreement also aims to facilitate transit transport, logistics, transport network security and related infrastructure development through joint study and promote cross-border projects including railway, road, civil aviation, power grid, information and communication. The MoU also states that the two sides would conclude the joint feasibility study of China-Nepal Free Trade Agreement shortly and, if viable, start negotiations on a Free Trade Agreement to open up more markets and expand bilateral trade.Other stated areas of agreed cooperation are establishing cross-border economic cooperation zones at the existing ports, and improving the investment landscape with a view to developing mega projects in the areas of power generation, water conservation, road, railway line, cross-border transmission line, information and communication technology and infrastructure, besides customs and quarantine.Nepal also had a shaky position on the BRI in the past. After signing the deal in 2017, the government formed two committees headed by the foreign and finance secretaries to negotiate with China on the projects selected under the initiative. The finance secretary was tasked with project selection.As per the Cabinet’s mandate, the finance secretary-led committee picked 35 projects to be funded under the BRI. Then-prime minister KP Sharma Oli read out this list during his meeting with Chinese counterpart Li Keqiang. Later, the Chinese side urged Kathmandu to cut the number of projects to a single digit, whereupon the list was pared down to nine projects.A former finance ministry official who was involved in several negotiations with the Chinese side said most of the nine projects were related to connectivity and infrastructure. In 2019, during the second BRI Conference in China, its outcome document listed Trans-Himalayan Multi-Dimensional Connectivity Network under the BRI. (Former President Bidya Devi Bhandari had attended the conference.) Then, when Chinese President Xi visited Kathmandu in October 2019, the two sides agreed to enhance cooperation under the BRI.They agreed “to intensify implementation of the Memorandum of Understanding on Cooperation under the Belt and Road Initiative to enhance connectivity, encompassing such vital components as ports, roads, railways, aviation and communications within the overarching framework of the Trans-Himalayan Multi-Dimensional Connectivity Network with a view to significantly contributing to Nepal’s development agenda of graduating from a Least Developed Country,” according to a joint statement issued after Xi’s visit to Kathmandu.The Chinese side was keen to carry out the feasibility study of Kerung-Kathmandu railway under the BRI, the former finance ministry official said. “But we have shifting priorities on selecting and negotiating other projects.”The feasibility study of the Kerung-Kathmandu railway has already begun with a Chinese grant and it is expected to conclude by 2026 June, said Rohit Kumar Bisural, director general at Department of Railways.“As per our agreement, the feasibility study of the cross border railway should be completed by 2026 June. There are various studies on the ground. Nepali engineers and technical staff are not directly involved but they are supporting the Chinese technicians as required. There are no glitches. Once the study is complete, we will jointly write a report,” said Bisural.A joint secretary at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs told the Post that no tangible progress has been made in the past seven years in implementing the BRI plan and no agreement is likely anytime soon either.“This calls for consensus among the political parties as it is not just a matter of the government or one party,” said the joint-secretary. “The BRI is unlikely to move forward in Nepal anytime soon because there is no discussion, consultation and consensus among the major parties.”Mahendra Bahadur Pandey, former foreign minister and Nepal’s ex-ambassador to China, said many leaders and officials have blamed high-interest loans for not taking the BRI forward but that is not the reason.“We do not complete projects on time. If we did, we could easily pay back the loan and interest to China and other lending countries. Our leaders also fear the reaction of other countries [to accepting any kind of Chinese help],” said Pandey.“We have ‘fear psychosis’ while taking economic support,” he said. “Nepalis are scared that India, China or the United States will be angry if the country takes support from any one of them.” “We have to accept foreign support by taking neighbours and major powers into confidence,” Pandey said. \nEducation in Every Home’s report titled ‘Diversity, Equity and Inclusion in Nepal’s Textbooks’ highlights the lack of diversity, inclusivity, and inaccuracies in these textbooks.  The findings include egregious mistakes in textbooks like the inclusion of a letter Abraham Lincloln supposedly wrote—dating to a time 17 years after his assassination, to assertions like Brazil has tigers, elephants and rhinos while Germany has tigers and monkeys. The books display a clear bias in favour of Brahmin Chhetri males, while women make up just 18 percent of all people profiled. While 80 percent of all bylines are male, the presence of marginalised communities, especially Dalits, is nearly non-existent.  \n**Summarization:**\n\n[Subject or Event] underwent [Key Action(s)] leading to [Consequence or Outcome] in [Timeframe].\nLed by a Mandarin speaker with a Chinese politics master's degree, the Araniko Project explores Nepal-China relations through Mandarin primary sources.\nNepali institutions organized \"Project Sambad,\" a platform for critical discussions on Nepali society and policy-making, with its first event in Kathmandu on March 14-15.\nSince 2017, Upendra Yadav's Janata Samajbadi Party-Nepal has consistently led the Madhesh provincial government, yet experts criticize its governance, accusing it of failing to promote federalism and other crucial reforms.\nKP Sharma Oli criticized Finance Minister Barsha Man Pun's budget for not aligning with the socialist principles of the constitution and instructed lawmakers to scrutinize it, highlighting concerns about a lack of consultations among ruling coalition partners.\nParliament formed a 7-member committee to investigate misuse of public funds by cooperatives after overcoming numerous obstacles and discussions, but the investigation's commencement remains uncertain despite establishing terms of reference.\nThe current political equation is experiencing turbulence from the provincial to central level, and managing dissatisfaction within ruling parties has become a Herculean task for Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal and KP Sharma Oli, the UML chair and key architect of the ruling coalition.After Madhav Kumar Nepal, the chair of the coalition member CPN (Unified Socialist), joined a meeting of opposition parties on Wednesday called by the main opposition Nepali Congress chief Sher Bahadur Deuba, it sent shockwaves through the ruling coalition. This prompted Dahal and Oli to meet Nepal on Friday to discuss the matter.On Thursday, Prime Minister Dahal called on Jhala Nath Khanal, another senior leader of Unified Socialist, and discussed the possibility of the Nepal faction lending support to the main opposition in pursuit of a more advantageous deal.But, according to Khanal, he assured the prime minister that his party would remain within the present ruling alliance and had no intention of quitting the government. The Unified Socialist has two ministers in the federal Cabinet and the party played a crucial role in forming governments in Sudurpaschim and Koshi provinces as well now both Dahal and Oli are looking for similar kinds of support from the party to form a new government in the Madhesh province.But Nepal’s party has its own grievances. “The UML is not cooperating with our chief minister in Sudurpaschim,” said Jagannath Khatiwada, spokesperson of the Unified Socialist. “And, they have not bothered to ask us for our ministerial nominees for the new Koshi Cabinet.” Dirgha Sodari of Unified Socialist is the chief minister of Sudurpaschim, but the UML has not provided him its list of ministerial candidates. While in the Koshi province, Chief Minister Hikmat Karki has not reached out to the UML for the Unified Socialist for ministerial nominations, according to party sources.On Wednesday, opposition parties sought support from Nepal to ensure the continuity of the sitting chief minister Saroj Yadav of the Janata Samajbadi Party in Madhesh Province. “Both Dahal and Oli feared that we might extend support to Yadav,” Khatiwada said.Khatiwada expressed dissatisfaction with the ruling coalition saying, “Although we are in the federal coalition, we are not consulted before taking any decision.”During a meeting of the party’s parliamentary committee on Friday, the prime minister claimed that Nepal had consulted him before attending the meeting with opposition parties.“Nepalji is very much with us, and there is no chance of any change in the coalition,” Dahal said at the meeting. However, UML has taken serious objection to Nepal’s participation in the meeting of the opposition parties. The UML’s concern seems valid as Nepal in recent weeks has been publicly airing his dissatisfaction against the government and the coalition over “continued neglect” of his party by the ruling coalition leaders.According to a leader of the Maoist Centre, Oli expressed his reservations over Nepal’s participation in the meeting of the opposition parties. “It does not look good,” Oli said to Nepal during their meeting on Friday, according to a UML source. “While you are part of the government, you are also participating in opposition party meetings. This is objectionable.”Opposition parties are waiting for the Supreme Court’s verdict regarding the split of Upendra Yadav’s Janata Samajbadi Party Nepal. The party was part of the government, but after the division, a faction led by Ashok Rai is the government and the other faction led by Upendra Yadav is not. Yadav challenged the legality of the split in the court. During the Maoist Centre’s parliamentary party meeting on Friday, Nepal’s participation in the opposition parties' meeting was one of the topics of discussion, and some lawmakers wanted to hear from the prime minister about Nepal's potential move, according to a Maoist Centre leader. “Nepalji had informed me before participating in the meeting of the opposition parties. Do not have doubts about the stability of the government, it is very much intact. He did not attend the meeting to join the opposition alliance,” Dahal said in the party’s meeting, although his remarks raised concerns about the future of the current ruling alliance. Recently, the prime minister secured a vote of confidence with comfortable support. Despite this, he felt the need to reassure his party leaders that the government remains stable and no one is going to unseat him anytime soon. Barely hours after making this claim, Dahal, joined by Oli held a meeting with Nepal at the prime minister’s office and sought his assurance in forming a new government in the Madhesh province.But the Unified Socialist has yet to take a formal decision on whether to support the opposition’s candidate, current chief minister Yadav, or the federal coalition’s candidate from CK Raut’s Janamat Party. Raut’s party is eying the post with support from CPN-UML and the Maoist Centre.“It’s all about give-and-take and bargaining,” said Khatiwada, adding, “If we get credible assurances from the prime minister and Oli that they will provide full support and cooperation at both the centre and provinces, then we will support the process of forming the new government in Madhesh province.” \nA standoff between Road Division, Kathmandu, and Kathmandu Metropolitan City at New Road ended without any untoward incident on Monday after the federal government deployed a massive police force.The city police, deployed in huge numbers to stop the division’s workers from repairing the road section between New Road gate and Juddha Salik destroyed by the metropolis, were backed off after federal police intervened.“We are committed to executing an order of the metropolis to expand pedestrian lanes in the New Road area,” said Raju Nath Pandey, chief of City Police. “We backed off, as we cannot scuffle with the federal police force. Everybody knows who deployed the federal police and what their intention is. There are hundreds of places in Kathmandu where road conditions are not good, but the Road Division has hurried to fix the parts we cut for expansion of the sidewalks.”The dispute between the two agencies—Road Division and Kathmandu metropolis—over expanding pedestrian lanes and not letting cutting road sections spiraled into Monday’s standoff.Some ten days ago, the metropolis cut 1.5 metres on both sides of roads in New Road to expand footpaths.The division intervened and stopped the metropolis workers from cutting the roads, saying that the road section comes under its jurisdiction and that the city office has not taken approval for the footpath expansion.Mayor Balendra Shah then directed officials to dump truckloads of dirt and trash in front of the main entrance of the Road Division office, blaming the agencies for delayed road expansion work from Kalanki to Maharajgunj which had caused problems for the public.Taking to social media, Kathmandu Mayor Shah blamed Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Physical Infrastructure and Transport Raghubir Mahaseth for not expediting the road expansion.“If your direct order can stop an ongoing project, it can also complete the work,” Shah said.“For the past 15 years, the citizens of Kathmandu have had to breathe in dusty air and face hardships in the name of Ring Road expansion,” reads Shah’s status posted on social media.Mayor Shah also sarcastically warned that the KMC would send a truckload of dust as a gift to Minister Mahaseth every day until the work along the Ring Road section is expedited.“It does not look good for only the public to suffer. I will continue to send a truckload of dust to you as a ‘gift’ every day until the work is resumed. Please accept it as love,” Shah wrote.The 8.2km Kalanki-Maharajgunj section was to be widened by the Chinese government, and the work was initially planned to start in early 2020, but the project has not progressed even after years.The Road Division, which picked up the dust and garbage dumped by the metropolis on its own, criticised the metropolis for its act.“The behaviour of the largest and responsible local government of the country mocks the rule of law, and this kind of behaviour in a violent and chaotic manner will never enhance the dignity of the metropolis,” reads the statement issued by the division.The division later issued an ultimatum to the KMC, asking it to fix the damaged parts of the roads within two days.When the metropolis ignored the ultimatum, the division itself repaired the damaged parts taking the help of federal police forces.“The metropolis dug up the roads without taking approval from our office. Instead of seeking approval, it gave us notice about its decision,” said Pramod Khatiwada, information officer at the division. “As the monsoon is about to start and the New Road area is one of the busiest road sections, it was our responsibility to repair it.”When asked if metropolis officials are committed to expanding the pavements, Khatiwada said that he hoped concerned officials would “come to their senses” and sort out the disputes, obtaining approval from concerned agencies.“They should first hold discussions with officials and higher agencies and convince them why they need to expand the footpath and take over the road section from us,” said Khatiwada. “We hope that the city office will not repeat the same mistake again and again.”Metropolis officials said that footpaths in new road areas, which always remain busy and packed, should be widened enough so that pedestrians can move freely. Officials claimed that locals from the New Road area have also requested the city office for the expansion.“Locals have also complained about insecurity and sexual harassment in walking on the footpath,” said Sunita Maharjan, elected ward member of Ward 24 of the metropolis. “Locals from our ward have no objection to the expansion of the footpath. The metropolis has started expansion works in demand of the public.”Sobha Malakar, a local from the Indrachowk area, said that it is very difficult to walk on the narrow pavement in the New Road area. Most of the locals of Ward 24 demanded the expansion of the footpaths with the city office. “It is very difficult to walk freely on the footpath in the New Road area,” said Malakar. “Walking on the footpath is very suffocating in the area. Women and girls walk on the road risking collision with vehicles.”Some people supported the Road Division's moves to prevent the city office from expanding the footpath on Monday. Locals of Ward 24 said that those not seeking pavement expansion are from other wards who fear that the already narrowed roads in their area would be further narrowed.“Those who had protested for parking in New Road have been protesting against the expansion of the footpath,” reads Mayor Shah’s status posted on social media.He asked the public to consider how the road will be narrowed for driving when a sidewalk is made only of parts that were used for parking in the past. \nThe Commission for the Investigation of Abuse of Authority on Monday filed a graft case at the Special Court against 14 individuals, including Gajendra Maharjan, the mayor of Godawari Municipality in Lalitpur.The case has been filed against them, charging them with causing a revenue loss of Rs1.04 billion to the state coffers while approving tenders for the extraction of sand and stones from the fiscal year 2018-19 to 2022-23.The CIAA has named Maharjan, the then administrative officer, along with other people’s representatives and contractors, as defendants in the case. Information Officer at the Special Court, Yagya Raj Regmi, said the CIAA had filed the case on the charge of causing revenue loss by awarding contracts at rates lower than those fixed by the government.Maharjan, who was elected mayor from the Nepali Congress, is serving his second term as the municipal chief. \nMany countries worldwide have started using smart systems, including artificial intelligence, to manage chaotic traffic. Nepal, however, has chosen to deploy traffic rule violators as traffic rule keepers.What concerns legal experts, former law enforcement officials, and the chair of the State Affairs and Good Governance Committee of House of Representatives is the individual whim and fantasy of Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Home Affairs Ravi Lamichhane, who issued a direction under agencies concerned under his ministry to enforce the decision to deploy rule violators on the road for traffic management.“Stop ruling people at an individual whim. This is neither Rana nor Shah regime or military rule,” said Ramhari Khatiwada, chairman of the State Affairs and Good Governance Committee of the House. “Home minister should stop humiliating people, and he too is not above the law.”Khatiwada said that he had sought time with Home Minister Lamichhane to discuss the issue on Friday but he did not give him time. He said that the government should formulate a law first and bring regulations if it thinks deploying rule violators for traffic management is necessary.The Metropolitan Traffic Police Division of Kathmandu said that it had deployed 1,302 people who were booked for traffic rules violations, including drunk driving, on Wednesday.“We are only implementing the instructions of the higher agency,” said Jeevan Kumar Shrestha, the division’s spokesperson. “We provided basic instructions to the rule violators and deployed them on streets for traffic management.”When asked if rules violators would help traffic police manage Kathmandu’s traffic, Shrestha said that even the traffic police, who received one to one-and-a-half years of training, sometimes could not handle the traffic chaos.Former senior officials at Nepal Police also questioned the intention of the home minister to force traffic rule violators to stay on the roads. They say that existing law doesn't support the home minister’s decision, and it also jeopardises the safety of those being deployed on the streets.“The decision to deploy rule violators is against the will of the people, which is against the provision that the state will not force anyone to serve against their will,” said Hemanta Malla, former deputy inspector general of Nepal Police. “This decision can be challenged in court.”Managing traffic is an expert’s job. Traffic police, who have worked for years in Valley's traffic management, also sometimes find the job challenging. Legal experts said that the home minister should bring law and regulation first if he thinks the valley's traffic would be better managed by forcing rule violators to stay on the roads.“The decision is against the principle of the rule of law. People cannot be forced to follow the home minister’s irrational directions,” said Raju Chapagain, a constitutional lawyer. “Respective committee of the House, National Human Rights Commission and other concerned agencies should take note of this decision and direct the concerned agencies to stop ruling people at individual whims.” \nOver 7,000 children between six and eight years of age are out of school in the Kathmandu district and could miss the inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) in the ongoing immunisation drive, health authorities estimate.Officials said they only have an estimation of the number of children in that age bracket but do not know their whereabouts.“Children in the floating population, of parents working in construction sectors and factories or of those residing in slum settlements, who do not go to school, are the high-risk groups but they could be deprived of the vaccination programme,” said Dr Arjun Sapkota, chief of the Health Office, Kathmandu.“We will run a vaccination programme in health facilities on the last day of the campaign, but we are unsure if all the children missing the vaccine will get inoculated.”The Ministry of Health and Population launched a nationwide immunisation drive on Sunday, targeting over 1.46 million children born between April 2016 and October 2018 who have missed the inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) due to a global shortage. Those children were administered only Type-1 and Type-3 polio oral vaccines and had missed the Type-2 polio vaccine.Officials at the Immunisation Section of the Family Welfare Division under the Department of Health Services estimated that thousands of children throughout the country neither go to school nor participate in health care programmes.“Providing health care services, including routine vaccines, to those populations is the most challenging task,” said Dr Abhiyan Gautam, the section chief. “Chances of those groups missing the services, including the routine vaccines, are always there. We will send health workers to the at-risk areas to find such children.”Healthworkers found over 74,000 children out of school nationwide during the measles-rubella campaign launched in February. “We are aware of the children who are out of school,” said Gautam. “Floating population, scattered slums, working-class people, lack of awareness and poor access to health workers are major challenges to health workers. We will send health workers to the areas designated as risk zones.”Nepal has been polio-free since 2010, but the World Health Organisation officially gave the status on March 27, 2014, after maintaining zero polio cases for three consecutive years.After introducing the IPV vaccine in September 2014, the country switched to the bivalent oral poliovirus vaccine (bOPV0) from the trivalent oral poliovirus vaccine (tOPV). The trivalent oral poliovirus vaccine contains all three types of poliovirus: Type-1, Type-2, and Type-3. The current oral poliovirus vaccine is made up of live, attenuated poliovirus. The trivalent poliovirus vaccine was effective against all three types of poliovirus. However, the Type-2 component of this vaccine can lead to the circulation of vaccine-derived viruses. Its use was linked to a vaccine associated with paralytic polio, a condition in which children develop paralysis.Nepal became the first country in South Asia to incorporate the IPV vaccine in its routine immunisation programme in line with the UN health body’s endgame strategic plan to eliminate the risk of vaccine-derived poliovirus and phase out all oral polio vaccines in the routine immunisation programme.IPV consists of inactivated poliovirus strains of all three poliovirus types.Health officials say that children should continuously receive the bivalent poliovirus vaccine, even if they are administered the IPV vaccine, as the bivalent poliovirus vaccine is also necessary for intestinal immunity, while IPV provides mucosal immunity.The government's number one priority is childhood immunisation, under which 13 types of vaccines are given free of charge against a range of diseases, including measles-rubella, pneumonia, tuberculosis, diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus, hepatitis B, rotavirus, Japanese encephalitis, and typhoid, under the regular immunisation programme.Regular immunisation is one of the most successful programmes in Nepal, with a high coverage rate. The country has demonstrated remarkable progress in reducing the under-five mortality rate and the regular immunisation programme is credited with that.However, the Nepal Demographic and Health Survey-2022, carried out by the Ministry of Health and Population, showed that at least four percent of the children aged between 12 and 23 months received no vaccine at all. This figure was one percent in 2016. The Ministry of Health and Population said that the nationwide vaccine coverage rate for polio is 95 percent. \nVidushi Rana has been appointed the new Honorary Consul of the Republic of Iceland in Nepal. The event also marked the inauguration of the new Consulate premises in Kathmandu. Dignitaries from various sectors graced the welcome event, reflecting the importance of this diplomatic milestone. Gudni Bragason, ambassador of the Republic of Iceland, as a special guest underscored the need to strengthen bilateral relations between Nepal and Iceland. Rana expressed her gratitude and commitment to fostering stronger relations between Nepal and Iceland. She highlighted the mutual benefits of enhanced diplomatic and economic ties and looked forward to her role in promoting cultural and commercial exchanges between the two nations.  \nThe Central Dairy Cooperatives Association has issued an ultimatum to the government, stating that it would launch a protest if dairy farmers are not paid their outstanding dues by dairy companies within the next two weeks.Amar Bahadur Kunwar, president of the association, said that despite an agreement signed between the government and dairy cooperatives to settle the farmers' dues, the cooperatives, especially those associated with private dairy companies, have breached the agreement, causing the problem.Private and state-owned dairies owe around Rs5 billion to farmers, said Kunwar.On March 4, three private dairy associations—Central Dairy Cooperatives Association, Nepal Dairy Association, and Dairy Industry Association—the state-owned Dairy Development Corporation, and the Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock Development, had signed a trilateral agreement to pay farmers their dues.There, however, were no single representatives of the farmers during the signing of the agreement.Under the agreement, farmers who have not received payments since August last year were to receive a payment for six months or until mid-January by April 3. “The agreement was a lie,” said Kunwar.\"We have on Monday, notified in advance to the Dairy Development Board, Dairy Development Corporation, Nepal Dairy Association, Nepal Dairy Industry Association, Agriculture Ministry, Prime Minister’s Office and Finance Ministry about our protest plan and its consequences,” said Kunwar. “We have given a 15-day ultimatum to clear the payment, or else we will launch a stern protest.”Surya Prasad Paudel, general manager of the Dairy Development Corporation, said, “We borrowed Rs300 million in credit from the government and cleared the farmers due till December last year. We still owe more than Rs1 billion to dairy farmers since January.”In February, the corporation sought a bailout fund amounting to Rs300 million from the Finance Ministry. Subsequently, in March, the government decided to provide the credit.The corporation said the stock of butter and powdered milk has piled up due to low demand in the market, and as a result, the cash flow has stopped. Despite the summer heat, the demand for dairy products has not improved. The corporation has also issued a tender for the sale of butter and powdered milk. “Let's see how much we can sell,” Paudel said.Despite the summer season, the demand for dairy products has not fully picked up. “The low demand will not help us generate the income needed to pay the farmers,” Paudel said.Market insiders say that the Dahal-led government, without conducting proper studies, hiked the price of milk for two consecutive years to encourage farmers to produce milk. They said the consumer price of dairy products has become too high, as people's incomes have not improved, resulting in a slowdown in sales.On March 3 last year, the government hiked the minimum purchase price of raw milk paid to farmers by Rs9.1 per litre to Rs65.5. Later in the same month, the DDC increased the price of half-litre of standard milk that comes in a blue packet by Rs5.50 to Rs48.50.Demand for dairy products started falling as soon as the prices were hiked. “People's incomes have dropped. They cannot afford to buy a litre of milk that costs over Rs100. The curd price has jumped to Rs200 per litre, and the prices of other dairy products have also increased,\" said Madhav Timalsina, president of the Consumer Investigation Forum. “An unfair price on dairy products benefits neither consumers nor farmers.”Both state-owned and private dairies have been saying that the ongoing economic slowdown has dampened dairy demand, resulting in stopped cash flow and rising liabilities to farmers as products remained unsold for months.The corporation is yet to finalise the strategies regarding clearing the remaining dues, Paudel said.Kunwar of the Central Dairy Cooperative Association said that the association does not make the payment, but it facilitates settling the payment from the dairy industry and other problems. The association does not know why the dairy industry is not able to settle the payment as per the agreement.According to Peasants' Coalition Nepal, the association of dairy farmers, farmers in eastern Tarai are facing even greater hardships as it has been nearly a year since they received any payments. The farmers of Jhapa and Biratnagar [Morang] have not received their payments for months. The farmers of Chitwan are also struggling. \nThe United States Agency for International Development (USAID) Nepal brought together 100 Nepali business leaders at the Kathmandu Marriott Hotel on Friday to celebrate Menstrual Hygiene Day.The event celebrated the commitment by Nepal’s industrial and private sector leaders, emphasising the impact of creating menstruation-friendly workplaces, the organiser said in a statement.During the event, dignified workplace advisory board members and directors of the Annapurna Media Network Sachan J Thapa and Subha Khanal pledged Rs1 million worth of media spotlight to the dignified workplace programme in Nepal.Likewise, the Executive Director of Jasmine Hygiene Punit Sarda pledged Rs1 million worth of sanitary pads to the programme.Speaking at the event, USAID Nepal Health Office Director Patricia Mengech said USAID is proud of the partnership with the private sector to dignify menstruation across the country and improve the sexual and reproductive health of women workers in Nepal.“This support is part of a long-standing partnership, dating back over 70 years, between the US government and Nepal to improve the health care and wellbeing of Nepalis,” she said.Dignified workplace advisory board member Gaurav Agarwal, who is Director of Everest Hospitality and Chairman of the Shikhar Insurance Board, reiterated that he believes that a dignified workplace where women are respected and taken care of, including their menstrual hygiene needs, is a human right. \nA powerful storm on Friday and Saturday destroyed most of the banana crop in eastern Chitwan, the banana association said, claiming it was the worst loss the growers had ever faced.The Chitwan Banana Producers Association has estimated that the damage could reach around Rs120 million. With vast stretches of banana farms destroyed, producers warn of imminent shortages of bananas. Ashika Malla of Tulsipur, Chitwan, who leases land and grows bananas on 11 bigah (7.45 hectares), said his crop would be ready for market in the next few weeks. But his hope shattered.“Now, nobody will buy it. It’s neither matured nor ripened. It’s a big loss.\" Malla has yet to assess the full extent of the damage. Besides crop losses, he would need nearly Rs1 million to clear the fallen banana trees and plant new ones. \"It's a big blow,” said Bishnu Hari Panta, former president of the Chitwan Banana Producers Association. Farmers say there are considerable economic consequences for this sector because only a few banana plants are left standing in the eastern part of Chitwan. It would take about seven months to start production again, and even then, it would not be back to normal.Farmers have suffered loss, and they could face a double whammy. For the last one and a half years, most have not received insurance payouts.\"We are not sure of getting the insurance payout anytime soon,\" said Panta. \"Farmers are in big distress,\" he said, adding that the government should immediately release the insurance payout. In Chitwan, banana plantation covers 3,500 bigha (2,370 hectares). Most of the plantations are in the eastern part of Chitwan. \"The eastern part of Chiwan suffered a big loss. The loss in the western part, however, is nominal,\" said Janak Raj Pant, general secretary of the association.Experts say that climate change is making storms more intense and devastating.Apart from droughts and floods, storms and hailstorms are also increasing in Nepal and are considered a major climate-related disaster.According to the National Climate Change Survey 2022, the second of its kind, released by the National Statistics Office recently, the economic losses in both farm and off-farm sectors in the last five years, as reported by households, excluding significant infrastructure damages, amounted to Rs415.44 billion.The survey report said that drought had been reported as the major disaster, affecting 65.4 percent of households, followed by diseases and insects at 54.3 percent, storms at 46.2 percent, hailstorms at 32.6 percent, floods at 28.5 percent, cold waves at 21.7 percent, landslides at 21.5 percent, and inundation at 17.5 percent.Farmers in Chitwan lament the government’s policy on insurance. Since March 14, non-life insurance companies have stopped settling claims for insured farm products after failing to receive government premium subsidies.The government is yet to clear around Rs3 billion under this heading to non-life insurance companies.“The non-payment issue in the agriculture sector has put us in difficulties. Since companies have totally stopped farm insurance, it will erode the confidence of the farmers towards insurance,” Pujan Adhikary, director of the insurance development and promotion division of the Nepal Insurance Authority, recently told a meeting.“Smallholder farmers and rural communities cannot manage climate risks by themselves without adequate financial instruments.”Crop insurance was introduced in Nepal with much fanfare. The government has been formulating directives to implement crop and livestock insurance since January 2013.Under the scheme, the government provided a 50 percent subsidy on the premium in the first year and raised it to 75 percent in the second year.The premium subsidy was again reduced to 50 percent and raised to 80 percent in 2021.When the insurance scheme started ten years ago, there were 802 claims. In the last fiscal year, the annual claims reached 36,000. The Ministry for Agriculture and Livestock Development said that the insurance scheme resumed on May 30 following a meeting chaired by Agriculture Minister Jwala Kumari Sah. In a statement, the ministry said it would immediately release Rs970 million to the insurance companies, and the remaining dues will be settled within this fiscal year or by mid-July.“The insurance companies have agreed to resume the scheme,” the ministry said in a statement. \nThe 16th five-year periodic plan, proposed by the National Planning Commission, aims to reduce neonatal deaths to 13 from the existing 21 in every 1,000 live births. Public health experts, however, are sceptical of its success, as neonatal deaths have not declined since 2016, and the measures taken at present are not sufficient to lessen the ongoing death rates.“Both the Nepal Demographic and Health Survey-2022 and the finance ministry’s recent report show neonatal deaths constantly high,” said Dr Shyam Raj Upreti, former director general at the Department of Health Services. “It will not be easy to pick high-hanging fruits. It requires a lot of investments and micro planning, which are currently lacking.”A recent report by the Ministry of Finance shows that 21 neonates die in every 1,000 live births, the same results shown by the Nepal Demographic and Health Survey-2022, carried out by the Ministry of Health and Population.The government’s target for Sustainable Development Goals is to reduce neonatal mortality to 12 deaths per every 1,000 live births by 2030.The SDGs, a follow-up on the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), aim to end poverty, hunger, and all forms of inequality in the world by 2030. Nepal has committed to meeting the goals.The 16th five-year plan, which starts next fiscal year and ends in 2029, is aligned with the SDG targets.Public health experts say meeting the goal is easier said than done. Most health facilities having birthing centres lack neonatal units, trained human resources, and quality services.“Without ensuring quality services, which require trained human resources and advanced facilities, among others, it is impossible to reduce neonatal deaths,” said Upreti. “The government has made various plans to reduce child deaths—including neonatal deaths—but does not pay much attention to their effective implementation.”The finance ministry’s recent report shows that the institutional delivery rate increased to 80 percent from 79 percent last year. The rise in institutional deliveries has contributed to lessening the maternal mortality rate, which is 151 in every 100,000 live births.“Fifty percent of the neonates die in the first 24 hours of birth,” said Dr Abhiyan Gautam, chief of the Immunisation Section at the Family Welfare Division of the Department of Health Services. “Most of our health facilities, including birthing centres, lack proper infrastructures.”Study shows that 85 percent of all deaths among children under the age of five in Nepal take place before a child’s first birthday, with 64 percent occurring during the first month of life.Along with trained human resources, infrastructures and quality services, deaths of neonates are also linked to the antenatal care visit of pregnant women, access to health facilities, timely referral system and others, experts say. The government has been taking various measures to reduce neonatal deaths, including planning to set up a ‘special newborn care unit’ in all district hospitals throughout the country. For that, concerned agencies under the health ministry have imparted training to all doctors, nurses and paramedics serving in Nuwakot, Dhading, Sindhupalchok and Makawanpur district hospitals.Special newborn care units are general units designed to care for newborn children who fall ill shortly after birth. Doctors, nurses, and paramedics monitor ailing children admitted to the unit.The health ministry has installed an underfloor heating system at birthing centres in four mountain districts to curb postpartum and neonatal deaths there.Underfloor heating is a form of central heating that ensures indoor climate control for thermal comfort. It uses an electrical heating cable installed underneath the flooring.Hypothermia, infection, low birth weight, premature birth, and abnormal birth asphyxia are among the leading causes of neonatal deaths, doctors say.Some of the programmes being undertaken to lower child mortality include newborn care, kangaroo care, exclusive breastfeeding, infection prevention, chlorhexidine for umbilical cord care, and free neonatal care. “Whatever the achievements we made so far were achieved by the measures taken as of now,” said Upreti. “The ongoing programme may not achieve further progress. Government must implement the programmes and plans to prevent more deaths.” \nThe government has allocated Rs86.24 billion to the health sector for the upcoming fiscal year, around a 2.5 percent increase from the 83.99 billion allocated for the current fiscal year.The new allocation is only around 4.6 percent of the total budget.Funds have been allocated to give continuity to most of the ongoing programmes—safe motherhood programmes, free essential medicines, setting up basic health care centres in all wards throughout the country, and financial relief to people from difficult and expensive diseases—cardiovascular disease, cancer, renal failure, Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, head and spinal injury, sickle cell anaemia, and stroke. The health budget also includes grants to Tribhuvan University Teaching Hospital, Nepal Police Hospital, Nepal Army Hospital, Civil Hospital, and others. The national budget has announced a few new programmes, including the establishment of the Sita Dahal Memorial College of Naturopathy and Yogic Science under Kathmandu University. Sita Dahal is the late wife of Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal, who died in July last year. Health experts said that the incumbent government neglected the health sector this year, too, as a slight increase in the annual budget does not help to continue the existing health programme.“How can we achieve the Sustainable Development Goals targets from the budget allocated to the health care sectors?” said Mahendra Prasad Shrestha, former chief specialist at the Ministry of Health and Population. “We need to bring qualitative change, and for that, huge investments are required.”Several healthcare programmes, including safe motherhood programmes, child health programmes, tuberculosis control, nutrition, vector control programmes, epidemic control, non-communicable diseases, and mental health programmes, have already been affected by the cut in the previous year’s budget.Likewise, the budget doesn't address the growing burden of non-communicable diseases.Non-communicable diseases—such as heart disease, stroke, cancer, diabetes, and chronic lung disease—have emerged as major public health problems of late, accounting for 71 percent of deaths in the country.A 2019 study by the Nepal Health Research Council on the prevalence of noncommunicable diseases, which primarily focused on behavioural risk factors—tobacco and alcohol consumption, biological risk factors, raised blood pressure, overweight, obesity, abnormal lipid prevalence, coronary artery disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and diabetes—found non-communicable diseases have emerged as a major killer.Nepal has witnessed several outbreaks in recent years—dengue, cholera diarrheal diseases, and other vector-borne diseases. The country has failed to achieve the malaria elimination target.“Every hour, one person commits suicide, the burden of non-communicable diseases has increased alarmingly, and neonatal deaths have not declined in the past several years,” said Shrestha. “Several programmes of health, including a free screening of cervical cancer and renal problems in the state-run health facilities, could not be implemented due to various reasons. The budget allocated for health even does not support continuing the ongoing programmes.”Experts caution that budgetary cuts in crucial healthcare programmes would have a long-term impact and could affect the achievements made over the years.“The government has not allocated the health budget to strengthen the federal structures,” said Dr Padam Bahadur Chand, former chief of the Policy Planning and International Cooperation Division at the Ministry of Health. “Most of the health budget will be spent on the salaries of the staffers.” \nNepal on Friday confirmed the spread of the Covid sub-lineages KP.1, KP.2, KP.3, and KP.4 in the country.All the sub-variants are offshoots of the Omicron variant, which is considered responsible for the surge in new cases of coronavirus in the last few weeks.The National Public Health Laboratory, which carried out whole-genome sequencing on swab samples of coronavirus-infected persons, said that 31 out of 42 swab samples tested positive for different sub-lineages.According to a statement issued by the laboratory, the KP.2 sub-variant was confirmed in 17 swab samples, KP.1 in 12, and KP.3 and KP.4 in one sample each. Similarly, Omicron’s JN.1 was detected in 7 swab samples, and BA.2 was detected in 2 swab samples.“The Omicron’s variants JN.1 and KP.2 have high prevalence, which accounts for nearly 40 percent of samples run for sequencing,” reads the statement.The KP.2 is a member of a group of SARS-CoV-2 variants, also called “FliRT” variants.Whole-genome sequencing is a comprehensive method of analysing the entire DNA sequence of an organism’s genes. Researchers believe that whole-genome sequencing of coronavirus could be instrumental in tracking the virus's severity and properties.Nepal confirmed the spread of the JN.1 sub-variant of the coronavirus in the country in January. Given its rapid spread around the globe, the World Health Organisation classifies JN.1 as a separate ‘variant of interest’. However, the UN health body said that based on available data, “the additional public health risk posed by JN.1 is currently evaluated as low”.The UN health body has classified KP.2 as a variant under monitoring. There is no indication that KP.1 and KP.2 are more transmissible or cause more severe disease than other circulating variants. Swab samples were collected from Covid-infected persons in April and May, according to the laboratory.Hospitals in Kathmandu had reported a surge in serious cases of Covid infection in April. Doctors attending the infected patients had said that elderly people and those with underlying conditions were getting severe.Health authorities nationwide have stopped active case findings, including contact tracing and free testing for all, after the second wave of the pandemic subsided in 2021. Hospitals have been carrying out tests only on those seeking polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing to go abroad or seriously ailing patients with respiratory illness. Several countries, including India and Singapore, have reported infection with the KP.2 and KP.1 sub-variants of the coronavirus. According to media reports, India has recorded 324 cases of Covid, including 290 cases of KP.2 and 34 cases of KP.1.Experts say almost all variants of the coronavirus present in India have found their way into Nepal. Even if the JN.1 sub-variant is not as deadly as the Delta variant, the virus still poses a serious threat to the elderly and people with compromised immunity.Over 12,000 people died, and hundreds of thousands were infected in the first, second and third waves of the Covid pandemic. \nHealth authorities have failed to locate the whereabouts of over 1,500 girls who were jabbed with the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine once but did not show up for a second dose.Officials at the Ministry of Health and Population said that health agencies in all seven provinces have been making phone calls and requesting them to come for a second dose of the vaccine.“Hundreds of girls aged between 14 and 15 years did not show up for the second dose of HPV vaccine, as they were preparing for secondary education examinations (SEE),” said Dr Abhiyan Gautam, chief of the Immunisation Section at the Family Welfare Division under the Department of Health Services. “After they completed the exam, some returned to their homes and others to cities for further studies.”The health ministry’s data shows 9,980 girls between 14 and 15 years of age from the seven provinces were jabbed with the first dose of the HPV vaccine in a pilot programme launched in September last year. Those who were administered the first dose were supposed to take the second dose of vaccine in six months.Health authorities first launched the second dose vaccination in federal hospitals in all the provinces, but due to a low uptake, they sent vaccinators to schools. The vaccination programme was suspended later after vaccinators failed to track the girls who were administered the first dose.Officials hoped that girls would seek a second dose of the vaccine after completing the SEE examination, but that too did not happen.Human papillomavirus is a viral infection that spreads through skin contact. The virus causes cervical cancer, which is the second most common cancer in the developing world and a major cause of death among Nepali women. Hundreds of women get diagnosed with cervical cancer every year in Nepal.According to the BP Koirala Memorial Cancer Hospital in Bharatpur, more than 700 women suffering from cervical cancer seek treatment at the hospital every year.Doctors say most cervical cancer cases are associated with HPV, a sexually transmitted infection and that widespread immunisation could reduce the impact of cervical and other cancers caused by the HPV worldwide.Countries like Bhutan, Sri Lanka, Thailand and the Maldives have introduced the HPV vaccine nationally, while India and Indonesia have introduced it in some districts.In 2016, Nepal piloted HPV vaccination in Chitwan and Kaski districts. All girls aged between 11 and 13 years were then given two doses of the vaccine.Experts say early treatment prevents up to 80 percent of cervical cancer.HPV vaccination was also included in the government’s policies and programmes for the next fiscal year 2024-25, which is a repetition of the past several years. Health ministry officials, who used to claim that HPV vaccination would be available to all eligible girls in 2022, said a nationwide HPV vaccination drive is likely in 2025 only.The ministry plans to inoculate around 1.7 million girls between 10 and 14 years with the HPV vaccine through nationwide drives and also make it part of regular immunisation.According to officials, the Global Alliance for Vaccine and Immunisation (GAVI) has agreed to provide HPV vaccine doses. Once the campaign is completed, the vaccine will be included in the government’s routine immunisation programme.Nepal submitted a proposal to GAVI in July last year requesting free HPV doses so that the vaccine could be included on the regular immunisation list. Ministry officials say they have proposed a budget for nationwide HPV vaccination campaigns in 2025.Officials say that GAVI has already agreed to provide required vaccine doses, but the problem is their availability. The World Health Organisation says HPV vaccination is recommended as part of a coordinated strategy to prevent cervical cancer and other diseases caused by the virus.The UN health body says HPV is responsible for more than 70 percent of cervical cancer cases in women. Countries that have included the HPV vaccine in their regular immunisation list have successfully reduced cervical cancer cases in women, according to doctors. \nAditya Mishra is a Nepali chef and entrepreneur based in New York. Passionate about elevating Nepali cuisine globally, Mishra sharpened his culinary skills while staging at various Michelin-starred restaurants in the city during his time at culinary school. A recipient of the James Beard Foundation National Scholars Scholarship in 2023, Mishra’s early experiences inspired him to establish his own supper club, ‘The Sewing Tin’, alongside co-founder Akhil Upad.In an interview with Post’s Aarati Ray, Mishra discusses his restaurant in New York, serving Nepali cuisines there and the recipe for his signature dish.How did your cooking journey start in New York?At 14, I told my parents I wanted to be a chef, but they preferred I pursue a stable career like engineering, as many Nepali families do. So, I left for Louisiana in 2019 to study engineering.But, cooking never left my heart so, after a year, I left engineering college and moved to New York City. It’s been three and a half years and my parents only learned about it later. When my mom visited me in NYC and saw my dedication to cooking, she saw my passion and supported my decision.What sparked your interest in cooking from a young age?As a child, I was drawn to cooking shows on TLC. The glamour of cooking, eating, travelling and the prosperity of famous chefs was fascinating.Around age 16, I discovered Chef Anthony Bourdain’s groundbreaking book, ‘Kitchen Confidential’, which shed light on the reality of the culinary industry. I learned how he became a cultural icon in NYC, reshaping perceptions of chefs.I was also fascinated by chefs like Marco Pierre White, who was a mentor to Gordon Ramsay. Their stories of achieving fame while maintaining discipline intrigued me. But, as I grew older and entered the culinary world, I realised it was far from glamorous—it involved dedication and I am glad I persevered.How did the idea for The Sewing Tin originate?The concept of ‘The Sewing Tin’ came when I realised the stark contrast between the romanticised view of kitchen work and its harsh reality. Witnessing the struggles of many kitchen staff—economic hardships, immigration challenges and language barriers—I had to rediscover my love for cooking.During my internship at ‘Junoon’ restaurant, I met my co-founder, Akhil Upad, who shared my culinary enthusiasm despite his preparations for medical college. Together, we wanted to create a dining experience that was more personal and communal, offering fine dining with a sense of community.We wanted our food to tell stories, so we named our restaurant ‘The Sewing Tin’ inspired by the immigrant experience in NYC. When immigrants opened cookie boxes as kids, they often found sewing supplies instead of food.‘The Sewing Tin’ is like opening a cookie box and finding sewing supplies—something uniquely desi, or South Asian. How do you promote Nepali cuisine in New York City through The Sewing Tin?My partner is from Atlanta with Indian roots, while I come from Nepal, so our menu celebrates and reflects both cultures and heritage.We represent our respective cultures authentically. For example, we have a dish inspired by Newari cuisine called kachaila, similar to French Tartar. We present it as Tartar to make it accessible to our customers but infuse it with Nepali flavours, telling stories about its origins and giving diners a taste of my homeland.What do you think of the prospects of Nepali cuisine abroad?I’m on a mission to share Nepali food worldwide. I have served up dishes like chatamari and lamb sekuwa in my restaurant. But I’m still learning and want to explore more of Nepal’s cuisines. My big dream? To make Nepali cuisine reach more places because it’s got something special that can wow taste buds everywhere.How do you see the changes in restaurants in Nepal?The restaurant industry has deep roots in community and bringing people together, dating back centuries. While this core idea remains, modern restaurants have evolved, making changes to adapt to the times.Yet, in Nepal, despite the growing number of restaurants, many lack uniqueness and storytelling, focusing more on making money than fostering a sense of community.I’ve noticed a troubling trend of rising prices, especially for beloved dishes like momos, which makes people question if they're getting value for their money. It seems like profits are taking precedence over creating genuine, authentic culinary experiences.The industry is starting to lose the creativity and passion that once made it special. It might be time for chefs to shake things up, challenge the norm and bring fresh ideas to the table, revitalising the culinary scene with renewed energy and creativity.What challenges have you faced in New York as an outsider?Living in a bustling city like New York as an outsider has its challenges. But, this city is also full of opportunities for those who are passionate. If you stay true to your culture and want to share your story, opportunities are waiting for you.Even though it can be daunting because of the tough competition, the city appreciates determination and expertise. When I started my journey here, all I wanted to do was cook, eat and share the story of Nepal and its diverse cultures. Instead of focusing on the difficulties, I embraced the chance to follow my passion.What do you think about the criticism of blending Nepali food with modern culinary styles?Chefs care about their food—it’s like they’re sharing a story. They’ve put in a lot of effort to become skilled, so let them be creative. It’s okay to give helpful advice but don’t be mean just to criticise. Chefs shouldn’t also just copy what’s popular, they should cook what they truly love. That’s what makes food special and meaningful.Mishra’s signature dish:Confit Duck Chatamari A traditional Nepali delicacy with French influence.Ingredients:Duck (Legs and breast)Rice (soaked overnight)MayonnaiseWhole spices (cloves, cinnamon, cardamom, bay leaf)Red onionGarlicGingerMula ko achar (Fermented radish)ScallionsLemon juiceNepali pepperVinegarSaltSugarProcedure:For the Duck:Season duck with salt and pepper.Cook in a covered pan with whole spices, garlic, and ginger at low heat for 2 hours on a stove (270 degrees in the oven)Increase heat to crisp up the skin (approximately 15 minutes).Shred the duck meat.Confit Garlic Aioli:Mash cooked garlic and ginger and mix with mayonnaise, lemon juice, Nepali pepper and fermented radishes.Pickled Onions:Slice onions and cook in a mixture of vinegar, water, salt, sugar, and whole spices until softened (about 10 minutes).For the chatamari:Blend soaked rice to make a batter, let it ferment for 6 hours, and adjust consistency with water.Assembling:Cook chatamari batter in duck fat for 4 minutes.Top with shredded duck, aioli, pickled onions and scallions.Serve \nCeleus Baral exudes a serene aura when you meet her, and when she tells you she bakes, it makes sense. Even during a brief encounter, you can tell she has the patience needed to be a baker.“You can eyeball cooking, but baking is chemistry. You have to be meticulous. You cannot rush it, or it does not turn out as expected,” says the 21-year-old environment science student. She also runs the online baking shop Bakeleus. Recently, she has also started selling her baked goods beyond her online shop, with her first stall appearing at The Yellow House’s Night Market. Bakeleus’s menu lists a variety of offerings, including jams, granola, tarts, cakes, cookies, cupcakes and brownies. Baral began baking in 2020, during the lockdown, and launched her online shop last year.She grows much of the produce she incorporates into her baking, and believes we should all understand the origins of our food. “This connection fosters gratitude and a deeper appreciation for nature,” she says. Her background in environmental science, coupled with her affinity for the natural world, imbues her creations with a unique artistic sensibility. Each item she bakes is a testament to her creativity and experimentation, as she believes consistent practice is the key to mastery.Despite the demands of being a full-time student, Baral strives to accommodate orders, typically requiring a minimum of 72 hours' notice for delivery. She is a passionate and discerning individual, evident in the love she infuses into her baking.

The vegetable is relatively cheap and used in almost all cuisines and curries. This ubiquity could perhaps be why someone might be snubbingly called an ‘aloo’ in Nepal, but the reference does not make potatoes less important.Why have them With zero fat, potatoes contain many important nutrients—vitamins B1, B6, Vitamin C, which is an antioxidant, minerals and fibre. Along with starch, it is a good source of potassium, copper, vitamin C, manganese, phosphorus, niacin, dietary fibre and pantothenic acid. Potassium derived from potatoes is an electrolyte that benefits the heart, muscles and nervous system. Potato skin contains fibre, which is important for digestive health.Compared to other vegetables, potatoes are more energy-dense. It is free of fat, gluten, cholesterol and sodium. The relatively cheap plant-based food is also a good source of carbohydrates. Filled with nutrients, one can get a lot of them by consuming potatoes.Sourcing of potatoesPotatoes thrive in diverse climatic conditions. The country cultivates potatoes on around 200,000 hectares of land—from the plains of Tarai to the mountainous region.Every year, Nepal churns out around 3,410,000 tons of the stuff. It also imports potatoes and potato products worth Rs 8.71 billion.“These imports include potato chips, frozen potatoes and fresh potatoes,” said Biswas Poudel, a senior technical officer at the National Potato Research Programme.As its cultivation is possible in diverse landscapes, even climate change does not affect potato farming, experts say. Types of potatoesRed and white potatoes are popular and widely available in the country. Lately, dark potatoes or blue potatoes are gaining popularity.“Red potatoes are highly popular,” said Poudel. “Potatoes that come in colour contain more nutrients. Darker potatoes are packed with antioxidants.”Potatoes that taste sweet are a good source of vitamin A, an important nutrient for immunity and eye health. Purple potatoes are rich in antioxidants, including anthocyanins that may prevent heart disease and cancer and boost brain health.Other benefits As potatoes contain important nutrients, they benefit human health in multiple ways. Iron, phosphorus, calcium, magnesium, and zinc contained in potatoes help the body build and maintain its structure and strength. Consumption of the vegetable that is rich in potassium, calcium and magnesium helps reduce blood pressure naturally. Potatoes also contain a significant amount of fibre, which helps in lowering cholesterol levels in the blood and ultimately lessens the risk of heart disease. Fibre also boosts digestive health.Compared to other green vegetables, farmers use only a minimal amount of pesticides in potatoes, making them safe to eat. Chips and french friesOf late potato chips and french fries are gaining popularity in Nepal. They are also popular dishes in most restaurants and people have even started making french fries at home. Children love potato chips the most. Intake of nutrients and micronutrients, fibre and antioxidants components depends on how potatoes were cooked or prepared for food.Consumption of a lot of chips and french fries can lead to added calories and unhealthy weight gain.“Fibre and antioxidant and other micronutrients of the potatoes may be lost while frying,” said Poudel. “As potatoes are a carbohydrate-rich vegetable, it is not necessary to consume them with rice, which many people do in Nepal.”Experts say diabetic people should limit their potato intake as they cause spikes in blood sugar. \nChicken eggs are a healthy, nutritious superfood, containing most of the minerals and vitamins a body needs. They are relatively cheap as well. They are a complete source of protein, credited with a reduction in malnutrition in children and pregnant women in recent years in Nepal.According to nutritionists, consuming eggs daily has multiple benefits including weight loss, reduced blood pressure and protection against infections.Sourcing of our eggs Nepal is self-reliant on chicken eggs. According to the Nepal Egg Producers Association, poultry farmers in the country produce 3.1 million eggs a day.“Our production is sufficient to meet domestic demand,” said Shiva Ram KC, chairman of the association.Sizes and types Eggs are mostly available in two sizes—big and medium. Big-sized eggs cost Rs450 a crate (30 eggs) while medium-sized ones cost Rs435 a crate. Pastured eggs or eggs from local chickens are also available but they cost more than double the price of eggs produced in poultry farms. These are called Omega-3-enriched eggs, which are more nutritious than those produced on farms. Nutritionists say such eggs contain higher amounts of Omega-3 fat and are high in vitamins A and E. Omega-3 fatty acids are also known to reduce blood levels of triglycerides, a well-known risk factor for heart disease. As pastured eggs are scarce, one has to directly contact farmers to buy them. Officials at the Department of Food Technology said that generally, pastured eggs are not produced in bulk, but they may be made available through some trusted suppliers. Why have them, and how many? As chicken eggs are rich in protein, most minerals and vitamins, there are multiple reasons to take them. A whole egg contains Vitamin A, Vitamin B9, Vitamin B5, Vitamin B 12, Vitamin B 2, Vitamin D, E, B6, minerals—phosphorus, selenium, calcium and zinc.“A healthy adult can eat 1–2 eggs a day without hesitation,” said Dr Atul Upadhyay, a nutritionist. “A whole egg contains almost all the nutrients a body needs.”What about the quality of eggs? No agency in the country is checking the quality of the eggs being sent to the market. The issue of excessive use of antibiotics in chicken is often raised but no one talks about the presence of antibiotic residue in eggs.Studies in other countries including India show high levels of antibiotic-resistant pathogens in chickens raised for meat and eggs.The Department of Food Technology and Quality Control examines the quality of processed foods containing eggs but does not check the quality of eggs per se. Experts say there is no mechanism in the country to ascertain the quality of eggs. It is also difficult to determine the quality of eggs by merely looking at them, for instance whether they have thick or thin shells.Other benefits Eggs help in weight loss and strengthening prenatal bone. They increase mental energy. The lutein in the eggs enhances skin’s moisture and the protein helps tighten the skin. Egg yolk boosts skin complexion, as they are high in fatty acids, nutritionists say.Daily consumption of eggs might lower the risk of stroke. Antioxidants lutein and zeaxanthin contained in eggs help prevent eye diseases like cataracts and age-related muscle degeneration. Choline in eggs is important for pregnant women and breastfeeding mothers, as it helps with baby’s brain development. \nLocated in Bakhundole, Lalitpur, Piano Piano South stands as a serene oasis offering a delightful escape from the city’s hustle and bustle.

It passes through several indigenous ethnic villages and landscapes in Khotang and Bhojpur districts. This trail goes up to an elevation of 4,200 metres to the viewpoint of Silchung Peak and takes one through the settlements of the Kirati people. This route starts from Diktel Bazaar and passes through beautiful settlements like Chakhewa, Rawa Dhap, Salpa Bhanjyang, Silchung and Hanspokhari before ending in Bhojpur. There are some hotels in Diktel but trekkers are advised to carry tents. The trail offers panoramic views of most of the eight-thousanders, including Everest, Lhotse, Makalu, Cho Oyu and Kanchenjunga mountains. The spring season, March through May, is highly recommended for the trek.Janaki Mandir Janaki Mandir at Janakpur in Madhesh province was constructed in 1874 and is a blend of Mughal and local architecture. The temple is a three-storey building and has 60 rooms, making it the largest temple in Nepal. Pilgrims flock here by the thousands to pay homage to Janaki Mandir—Janaki being the other name of Sita, the daughter of King Janak. The temple houses an idol of Sita which was found near Ayodhya, the kingdom of Ram. The marriage anniversary of Lord Ram and Sita is celebrated in Janakpur every year on Vivaha Panchami, which falls in December. In the southwest corner of Janaki Mandir is the Vivaha Mandap, which has been built at the site where the marriage of Ram and Sita is said to have taken place. Another well-known temple in the vicinity is Ram Mandir, which is built in pagoda style and is hence different from the other temples in Janakpur that generally bear resemblance to Mughal architecture. It houses a female statue, said to be of Yogamaya, which has the reputation of being one of the most beautiful images of female forms in Nepal. Other holy sites of interest include the Laxman Temple, Sankat Mochan Temple and Hanuman Temple.Kuri Village, Kalinchok Kuri village, a popular tourist destination around 150 km from Kathmandu, lies at an altitude of 3,842 metres above sea level in Kalinchowk of Dolakha district, in Bagmati province. People visit the place to enjoy the snow during the winter besides the mesmerising landscapes and splendid panoramic view of the Himalayan range. Kalinchok gets snow mainly at the end of December and the snowfall continues till the end of February or mid-March. When there is snow, it is difficult for jeeps, buses and cars to reach the top of Kuri village. Chains are wrapped around the wheels of vehicles and specially modified jeeps with highly experienced drivers are used to carry visitors. There are several hotels and restaurants in the area. The road up to Kuri has also improved over the years.Annapurna Base Camp Annapurna Base Camp trek, in Gandaki province, makes for a picturesque journey that takes you to the foothills of the Annapurna South, up to 4,130 metres above sea level. The five-day trek (seven days for slow walkers) offers rich cultural diversities, typical Nepali villages and the flora and fauna nestled at the foothills of Annapurna. The distance from Pokhara to Annapurna Base Camp is approximately 81 kilometres. It is among the shortest and most budget-friendly treks in Nepal. For Nepalis, lodging costs around $5 to $10 per day. For foreigners, the overall cost of the trek ranges from $800 to $1500 on average per person. Annapurna Base Camp trek can be done at any time throughout the year as each season offers a different trekking experience. The ideal time for the trek depends on your weather preferences and what you expect from it. However, autumn (September to October) and spring (March to May) are considered the two best seasons for the trek, as the days at the time are warm and bright with clear skies.Bardiya National Park Bardiya National Park, located in the southern Tarai belt of Lumbini province, is home to one of the most elusive and majestic animals on earth—the Royal Bengal Tiger. The park, which covers an area of 968 square kilometres, is considered one of the most important protected areas in the country. It is a prime destination for those looking to catch a glimpse of a tiger. A bit of luck and patience will offer a good chance to see the Bengal Tiger. The jungle safari also offers one the opportunity to spot Asian elephants and the greater one-horned rhinoceros. The rare Gangetic river dolphins are occasionally spotted on rafting trips along the Geruwa River, the eastern channel of the Karnali river. Besides, visitors can enjoy the homestays and explore local Tharu culture. The right time to visit the park is from mid-September to mid-December and mid-February to May.Khaptad National Park Khaptad National Park in Sudurpaschim province is a protected area in the far western region. It stretches over four districts of Bajhang, Bajura, Achham and Doti and ranges in elevation from 1,400 to 3,300 metres. The park can be visited throughout the year. Trekkers are advised to bring their tents, food and other supplies. The Nepal Tourism Board says of late, social media has been increasingly influencing Nepali travellers to go to Khaptad. Since the far-flung Khaptad National Park is still offbeat for many travellers, the area remains pristine and fresh. The seasons of spring (March-May) and autumn (October-November) are the ideal times to visit the park. The temperature ranges from 10°c to 20°c offering pleasant trekking weather. The monsoon begins in June and lasts until September and during this time, roads often become muddy and slippery. From December to February, winter brings snow and chilling winds to the park.Limi Valley \nOnce again, my heart swelled with joy when my hometown came into view.Arriving at Lalikharka after the treacherous journey through Pauwa Bhanjyang and the bustling Kanchhi Dokan, Phidim, the headquarters of Panchthar district, revealed itself like a surprise gift. My home town, Phidim, is unique in the fact that it reveals to travellers approaching it from uphill. As the vehicle descends the mountain road, it slowly comes into view, its houses and buildings recognisable for the native son.This Dashain, I undertook the much-awaited trip to my hometown with my wife Kabita and daughter Aarohi. Little did I anticipate the transformation that awaited me.The moment I got out of the jeep, I noticed that Phidim, nestled in the lush hills, has undergone a remarkable transformation over the years. As I guided my family to my home, which had suffered damages in the 1989 quake that struck eastern Nepal, I found that old, mud and stone houses had been replaced by concrete buildings. The place was vastly different from the one I remembered.Arriving at my childhood home felt like reuniting with an old friend. Navigating its nooks and crannies with my daughter, we delved into the history of the house, a symbol of my cherished memories.My wife had visited Phidim years ago, spending a month with my parents. She, too, recalled beautiful moments she had had in the town. I asked the tenant about the neighbours and acquaintances. Some had died, while others had left for good.A call to local journalist Giriraj Banskota led me to the school grounds, where memories flooded back. This was where I spent my teenage years, playing ball, learning to kick, and watching major tournaments. Here, I even encountered a group of Western climbers headed to Kanchenjunga, the world’s third-highest mountain. I remember being awed by their shiny yellow tents, headlights and strange smell. I remember practising my tutephuteko Angrezi with the climbers. Birendra Shield, an annual sports tournament named after the late king, brought ace players from various schools in Panchthar district. The district also hosted Yuba Mela, an annual three-day fair to commemorate the birthday of the king, organising football tournaments in which teams from as far as Sunsari and Taplejung participated. I never excelled at dribbling balls. A boy growing up in a seven-member family, I soon found my interest in literature. In the late 1980s, Phidim hosted a major literary festival. In the run-up to the 1990 pro-democracy protest, walls were painted with anti-monarchy slogans, local politicians were arrested. I took my family to my school, Naya Namuna Secondary School. It was Saturday, so the school was closed. I peeked through the steel gate and wall, imagining myself labouring over classes. Memories are hazy, but what I remember most is going out of the school—to quiz contests with me leading the school team, to essay competitions at the District Education Office and to play carom board, a national pastime, in a nearby shopfront. Returning to the main street, the demolition of a landmark gate made me reflect on how cities transform, shedding old landmarks for new identities. Navigating narrow alleyways, I felt like a stranger in my own hometown. Multistory buildings have emerged and roads have been paved, reshaping the town. It’s the same place with a different face, leaving me nostalgic for the Phidim of my memories.We finally reached Shivalaya temple, which I told my wife and daughter was one of my cherished hangouts. A giant statue of Falgunanda (the Kirant leader’s birthday is celebrated on November 10) stood before the steps to the temple. Though my wife suspected I came here to smoke, in reality, I visited the temple in the evening to meet friends and talk about issues that mattered most to us at the time. It also offered a panoramic view of the town (I could not take my family to Gadhi Danda, a hillock across the Shivalaya).Towards the end of my journey, I felt sad about Phidim’s lack of prospects. To my dismay, I found that people have been leaving the town in droves. Despite blacktopped roads and multi-story buildings, Phidim faces a troubling reality. The lack of quality higher education and specialist healthcare has driven people away, echoing the circumstances that led me to Kathmandu years ago. Conversations with locals confirmed a mass exodus from the town, a trend that raises concerns about Phidim's future.My conversations with familiar strangers led me to conclude that Phidim has transformed into a transit town for pilgrims heading to Pathibhara Devi Temple, which is around 255 kilometres north in Taplejung district. I met dozens of people headed to the holy site. While pilgrims see it as a stopover, for me, it was a homecoming. The realisation dawned that Phidim is, perhaps, in a state of transition, trading its rustic charm for the hallmarks of urbanisation. While I left Phidim for higher education in Kathmandu, people from rural areas have flocked to the town in search of better opportunities, bringing life and energy to the once quiet community.As we bid adieu to my hometown, I couldn’t help but reflect on the inevitability of leaving a place, no matter how enamoured one is with it. Passing Kanchhi Dokan, I pointed out Kanchnajungha and Kumbhakarna to my daughter—symbols of my childhood. Phidim, now a blend of nostalgia and change, remains etched in my heart, a testament to the intricate dance between memory and evolution. \nThe gate leading inside the city of Lucknow proudly declares, “Muskuraiye aap Lucknow mein hain” (Smile because you are in Lucknow). During my brief stay, the city lived upto its promise. Known as the city of Nawabs, with a rich history going centuries back, the city is abuzz with autos, rickshaws, honks of public buses and the constant loud sounds of the metro going over your head, irritable honks of public buses and food that leaves you wanting more.In such a happening place stands Bara Imambara, built in 1784 by Asaf-ud-Daula. ‘Bara’ means big, and ‘Imambara’ is a building with a big hall where people assemble for mourning congregations. This building was originally built to provide employment for the public because, at that period, the country was going through a famine, and it was seen as a relief project. I walked through the grand entrance gate known as Rumi Darwaza (Turkish Gate), wiping my sweat and fighting the Lucknow heat, entering the vast complex. Echoing in all corners was a voice from the speaker that kept reminding the visitors of the many rules inside the historical place. I tried not to let the wonder overwhelm me as I walked through the complex. To my right stood the elegant Asafi Mosque, recently painted in cream-like white. Its design is visually pleasing and a testament to the Mughal era’s artistic finesse. Its walls are adorned with intricate calligraphy and elegant designs, reminiscent of a time when such aesthetics held great importance. I couldn’t help but admire the tremendous effort the craftsmen put into bringing the Nawab’s vision to life, meticulously crafting the elegant domes which seemed to touch the sky. The mosque’s serene atmosphere stands in stark contrast to the bustling city just beyond its walls.Upon stepping into the main hall—known as Asafi Hall—I was immediately struck by its sheer size. It is vast and impressive, appearing to stretch into eternity, and its massive arched roof seemed to defy gravity. What’s even more intriguing is that it stands without the support of pillars or beams. The interlocking system of bricks, a hidden secret, upholds this colossal structure, leaving one in awe of the brilliance of the builders of the past.This very hall houses a large vaulted central chamber with the tomb of Asaf-ud-Daula. Standing beside his tomb was a chilling moment, knowing that the remains of a great historical figure was resting just a few feet below. After scanning the large hall, the guide took me to my favourite part of the Imambara—the labyrinth or the Bhool Bhulaiyaa. This labyrinth sits right above the main hall, and because the hall is unsupported, the ceiling had to be lightweight, so the hollow labyrinth was born. It is quite impossible to figure out the Bhool Bhulaiyaa on your own, as it is a confusing network of corridors and staircases. So, it is necessary to have the company and guidance of a guide.As I moved with my guide through the maze, I thought I could feel the presence of the past inhabitants who had walked through these confusing passageways. What fascinated me most was the maze’s design: every sound, no matter how faint, echoed through the structure, enhancing its aura of mystery.The guide whispered from a distance, his head close to the wall, and the sound reached my ears, even though he was out of sight. It felt as if the walls carried the whispers. We exchanged astonished glances. When the guide reappeared, he smiled and remarked, “Now, you understand why they say that walls have ears.”Exiting the maze, I climbed to the roof, which offered a breathtaking view of Lucknow. The city spread out in front of me, its modern skyline contrasting the monument’s historic charm. It was a moment of reflection, contemplating how centuries had passed, and yet, Bara Imambara stood as a timeless witness to the changing tides of history. As I stood there, taking it all in, I felt recharged by the air coming in from all directions. After descending from the terrace, my brisk guide led me to the final stop in the Imambara, Shahi Baoli (Stepwell). Also referred to as the royal stepwell, it sits underground and is another example of architectural brilliance in the complex. This didn’t surprise me much since it was built at a time when architecture wasn’t just functional but also a work of art.The moment I descended the steps that led me underground, I noticed the sudden drop in temperature. The Shahi Baoli served as a cool refuge during the blistering summer day. The well-planned architecture of the Baoli allowed it to naturally regulate its temperature. The way to the main well is locked, but visitors can throw coins through jail-like doors into the well in order to try out their luck, much like we do in Davis Falls in Pokhara.Entering the underground corridors, I felt a slight chill because it was cold and dimly lit. I turned on my phone’s flashlight and saw the walls adorned with intricate Mughal carvings. Upon reaching a spot where we could see the well, the guide informed us that the well acted as a CCTV camera at the time. He explained that individuals inside the structure could discreetly observe those entering, as their reflections would be visible on the well’s water, but the people entering could not see the people inside the building.I waited to see that happen, and when a group entered through the gate, I was stunned; their faces were perfectly mirrored on the water’s surface, showcasing the ingenuity behind the well’s design, serving both as a water source and a security measure.My experience at Bara Imambara was a delightful one. I had never seen such a remarkable work of architecture before—it is beautiful, interesting and ahead of its time. \nSerene, snow-capped mountains set against the bluest skies. It’s a heavenly sight in pictures but mighty hard to climb in real life. Climbing Everest, Annapurna, or Manaslu means enduring freezing cold, biting air, and days of physical and mental strain until you reach the summit. The journey is a slippery path of rocks, rivers, and bridges, navigated skillfully by experienced trekkers, locals, and guides. In 2022, Nepal welcomed 15,781 trekkers, highlighting the importance of climbing and trekking guides for the country's economy.For new trekkers, understanding the trek can be confusing. If you’re anxious about missing something in your backpack or need motivation to start a trek, here are tips from two seasoned guides to help you grasp the essentials.Meet Luckme Syangden, a 25-year-old climbing guide with extensive experience in the treacherous heights of Everest. According to Syangden, maintaining a positive mindset is the first step towards a successful climb, both before and throughout the entire process.Preparation for the journeyTrekking is undeniably demanding, both physically and mentally. However, maintaining a ‘can-do’ attitude can go a long way in pushing people to their destination, says Syangden. “We never force the people to push through if we think they’ve reached their limits, but we do try to use ourselves as an example to show that they can,” says Syangden. According to Syangden, when you’re guiding so many people through the process of climbing, you realise that everybody is different; their bodies have different needs and limitations. So it’s important to move forward while assessing their physical and mental well-being. “We always maintain a strong, positive mindset ourselves and strive to inspire our trekkers with the same optimism. Rushing them when they’re unwell isn’t our approach,” says Syangden.Manu Rai, 32, has been a trekking guide for three years. Her passion for physical activities and exploring the vast landscapes of her village led her to this profession. Rai, an avid walker and traveller, found her calling when she met fellow adventure enthusiasts who shared her love for hiking and trekking. According to Rai, engaging in physical activities and regular workouts can significantly enhance the strength needed for embarking confidently on a trek.For novice trekkers, it’s advisable to begin preparing at least a month prior to the trek. Joining a gym or engaging in physical activities like walking can make a significant difference. Start with a 20-minute walk on the first day and gradually extend the duration as the trek approaches. This gradual increase helps in building strength, endurance, and confidence. Additionally, regular stretching is essential to loosen the muscles, reducing the risk of injuries while navigating challenging terrains. Personally, I've found going to the gym and incorporating squats into my routine immensely beneficial in strengthening my leg muscles. Backpacking essentialsWhen backpacking, packing wisely is key. Rai advises opting for light yet warm clothing instead of bulky jackets to reduce the load. She recommends essentials like down jackets, caps, goggles, sunglasses, sunscreen, a stick, warmer, gloves, socks, and sturdy boots. Syangden, who also carries the same essentials, stresses the importance of carrying a safety knife and period supplies for female trekkers.Managing periods during treksManaging periods during treks can be challenging, as Syangden points out. “I carry all of the supplies that I need, but as you can imagine, handling period cramps and all the other symptoms while trekking through gruelling mountains is no easy task. I just do my best to power through it all,” says Syangden.Handling altitude sickness and injuriesRai advises trekkers to rest and wait if altitude sickness strikes. Carrying painkillers and paracetamol is essential. If conditions worsen, trekkers can choose to halt their trip. In such cases, communication with fellow travellers and guides is key. Guides can also arrange transportation for the trekker’s return if needed. Effective communication with trekkers and guidesSyangden highlights the importance of communication and building positive relationships with fellow trekkers. Over her journey from being a beginner to a seasoned guide, she has learned that talking and fostering a friendly rapport with clients significantly smoothens the trek.“In my initial guiding days, communication was tough, but now I can confidently lead trekking groups,” Syangden states.Challenges faced by a female trekkersBoth Syangden and Rai acknowledge the challenges faced by female trekkers. They often encounter underestimation and demeaning comments questioning their trekking abilities. Syangden has personally dealt with such remarks, reflecting a wider issue where being a woman is wrongly linked to an inability to handle the physical demands of trekking. Becoming a trekking guideTrekkers and adventure-seekers may come to the realisation that their love for the mountains and hills can translate itself to a profession that not only supports their own passion but also that of those enthusiastic about the secrets of the mountains. According to both Syangden and Rai, the first step is to connect with a trekking association and enrol in a trekking guide course. Rai explains that this course covers essential skills like map reading, navigation, guiding techniques, geography, safety measures, and environmental knowledge.Additionally, Syangden, who is currently undergoing a climbing course, mentions that colleges now offer bachelor’s programmes in mountaineering, providing a comprehensive education for aspiring guides. \nFive young female travellers, Binita Jirel, Menuka Gurung, Juliana Shrestha, Rejina Tamang, and Shanti Rai, noticed a gap in the outdoor industry for a women-specific platform. So, they set out to build a platform that would encourage and empower women to travel the world and launched Duluwa Outdoors in 2021.The organisation’s social media posts generate much interest from women who want to travel alone but haven’t yet. The platform has become a hub for women to connect and share experiences. Shrestha discussed the possibilities of solo travelling for women in Nepal and her tips to individuals who are just starting their journey with the Post.Is travelling alone safe in Nepal? Since it has long been a well-liked vacation spot (for international tourists), Nepal has seen a lot of solo travellers. Besides the large number of foreigners exploring the Himalayas during their gap years, many Nepalis also travel the country solo. Most of them finish their journeys safely. So yes, Nepal is pretty safe for solo travelling.An example many overlook while talking about females travelling solo in Nepal is women travelling from their house to their parent’s house alone. This has been happening for decades and is a common thing most married women do multiple times in their lives. I say everyone should try travelling by themselves at least once in their life. I’m happy to see that many young people are travelling solo these days.What are some good solo travel destinations in Nepal?It’s tough to pick out just ten, as preferences vary from person to person. If you’re new to travelling alone, consider starting small with activities like going to the movies or having dinner alone. You could also begin hiking to places like Shivapuri, Namo Buddha, or Champadevi in Kathmandu.As you become more comfortable with solo travel, you can take short trips, like a long weekend in Pokhara-Bandipur. Make sure you consider nearby resources and the availability of transportation before you start your trips. When you return, I encourage you to reflect on your journey and see what you’ve learned—about yourself and the world. Then challenge yourself a little bit more. Nepal has so much to offer from trekking in the mountains. The Annapurna area is a great place to start. The trails are accessible and well-maintained, with plenty of facilities. You’ll also find other trekkers to connect with along the way. For those interested in exploring the valleys and towns along the hills, try places like Illam, Dharan-Dhankuta, and Palpa.Finally, for those looking to experience Nepal’s rich wildlife, destinations like Chitwan, Bardiya, and Shuklaphanta are all great choices.What are your tips for people who are just starting to travel alone?Plan at all times! Do your research on the fundamentals of travel, including transportation, lodging, connectivity, risk assessment, and activities.It’s also crucial to understand the type of trail or journey you’re taking so that you can dress appropriately and prepare for any potential risks, such as altitude sickness or accidents.Remember to budget appropriately and always have an emergency fund and research prices of essentials to avoid getting ripped off.What are some travel safety tips you swear by?Safety is a personal and situational concern that frequently arises when women travel alone.If you are just starting out, I’d advise you to get to a settlement before it gets dark—by 4:30-5:00 pm—when you are on long treks. Stay there overnight and continue on your journey the next morning.Be wary of wild animal attacks or possible natural disasters when you’re out in the wilderness. I would also suggest you consider taking a wilderness first aid course.Most importantly, be wary of other people. Trust your gut. If you think someone is suspect, keep your distance. Keep your loved ones, friends, or anyone else in your support network informed of your whereabouts, especially if you’re going to be in a place without service. Let them know when you might get service again so they won’t worry. \nNepal will aim to impress at the 2024 ICC Men’s T20 World Cup in the United States and the West Indies when they launch their campaign against the Netherlands at the Grand Prairie Stadium in Dallas on Tuesday.Drawn in Group D, the Rhinos will play their next group matches against Sri Lanka in Florida on June 12, followed by clashes against South Africa on June 15 and against Bangladesh on June 17 in the Caribbean. Nepal, ranked 17th in the men’s T20I, are one of the top four highest-placed associated nations in the tournament. The young guns, led by 21-year-old captain Rohit Paudel, have the potential to cause an upset at the cricket tournament’s biggest stage and will aim to make history by progressing from the group stage.The top two teams from each of the four groups will reach the Super Eight stage. But their recent form—and a group including three full member nations and surprise elements the Netherlands—suggests that making it into the Super Eight will be difficult.Nepal will be making their first appearance at the World Cup since the World T20 in Bangladesh in 2014. They have never qualified for the 50-over Cricket World Cup and are the least experienced side in the group.They are heading into the World Cup following a series of disappointing results, including the ACC Men’s T20 Premier Cup debacle and a heavy 63-run warm-up defeat against Canada.Inconsistencies with the bat have been one of their biggest headaches so far.Openers Kushal Bhurtel and Aasif Sheikh have failed to live up to the billing lately, resulting in a failure to give the team a good start. Three years ago, on April 17, 2021, when the duo fearlessly put on a record-breaking 116-run opening stand against the Netherlands in their T20I debut in Kirtipur during the Nepal Tri-Nation T20I Series, the impression was that Nepal had finally found the missing piece of their top batting order.However, questions have been raised over their form as the opening duo has failed to build any impressive partnership recently, especially this year.Bhurtel—despite being one of the three Nepali batters alongside Paudel and Dipendra Singh Airee to have crossed 1,000 T20I runs—is experiencing the worst year of his career and is showing no signs of improvement. In his last four T20I innings, he was dismissed for three ducks in a row during the Premier Cup, and for 10 runs against Canada during the World Cup warm-up. In between, he played knocks of 16, 2, 1 and 13 against West Indies A.Shiekh has also been unsteady with the bat. He scored a fifty against West Indies A and 22 against Canada in the World Cup warm-up but failed to cross double-digit figures in his previous four outings.Nepal’s batting display will heavily rely on skipper Paudel, who usually bats at number three, and big-hitter finisher Airee.Paudel is the most consistent batter in the Nepal squad. He is at his prime and entering the World Cup having scored 265 runs in his four innings that included a century and two half-centuries against West Indies A.Allrounder Airee holds the record for fastest T20I fifty. More recently, he entered the elite club when he smashed six sixes in an over against Qatar during the T20I Premier Cup, becoming the only third man to do so after Yuvraj Singh in 2007 and Keiron Pollard in 2021.Airee will certainly be the trump card of Nepal’s batting order at the World Cup.Kushal Malla, whose 34-ball hundred against Mongolia is the second fastest T20I century, is also expected to kindle fireworks.Nepal’s bowling unit will be another key strength at the World Cup, as they demonstrated in the warm-up game against Canada. They proved effective in the middle overs and struck five times in the space of 27 deliveries to limit Canada from 111-2 in the 14th over to 135-7 in the 18th over.All-rounder Sompal Kami—the only player from Nepal’s 2014 World Cup squad to feature in the 2024 edition—will bring hordes of experience in the bowling department and will lead the fast bowling alongside cult hero Karan KC, who is the highest wicket-taker in Nepal’s squad with 90 wickets from 68 innings.Lalit Rajbanshi will lead the spin threat alongside Sagar Dhakal, who is proving his worth by taking seven wickets in his last four matches.However, all eyes will be on Abinash Bohara, who will be crucial for Nepal at the back end of the innings as the majority of his wickets have come in the death overs. Since making his debut in 2019, Bohara has taken 74 wickets from 56 innings, which is the third highest for Nepal.Nepal will still be the heavy underdogs in the group, especially against 2014 world champions Sri Lanka and 2009 and 2014 semi-finalists South Africa. This will be the first time Nepal will face Sri Lanka and South Africa. Paudel, who is the youngest captain in the United States and the West Indies among the 20 participating nations, believes Nepal can do well at the World Cup. “I have faith in my team. They will give their best, be it in opening batting or other departments,” said Paudel, who added that the role of openers would be important. “It is upon the opening batters to get the team off to a good start,” he added.“In T20 cricket, no team is really a favourite. The Netherlands defeated Sri Lanka in the warm-up game. The United States beat Bangladesh twice for a historic 2-1 series victory. That’s why I believe we can and we will [compete].”If Nepal are to build momentum for the Super Eight stage, they will need to overcome their first hurdle against familiar foes Netherlands, who are making their fifth appearance at the T20 World Cup. But it will not be an easy task against the tricky Dutch, who are on the verge of completing a hat-trick of wins against the Proteas after defeating them in the 2022 T20 World Cup and the 2023 Cricket World Cup.“Our team is focused on the Netherlands match because it is very important for us to win that game and carry the thrust to the following matches. Our players are also well aware of their respective roles,” Paudel added.Nepal can also present a thrilling challenge to a Bangladesh team, who are reeling after hitting a new low after losing a series against inexperienced and tournament debutants, the US. The Tigers also lost to Zimbabwe by eight wickets in a T20I series earlier this month.This will be the second meeting between Nepal and Bangladesh. In fact, Bangladesh defeated Nepal by eight wickets in the group stage of the 2014 World Cup and progressed into the second round. The Bangladeshis have never made it to the knockout stages across eight editions of the tournament. \nNepal’s leg spinner Sandeep Lamichhane’s hopes to participate in the 2024 ICC Men’s T20 World Cup in the United States and the West Indies all but ended after the US Embassy in Kathmandu rejected him a visa for a second time in ten days.The embassy had called Lamichhane for an interview for a second time on Thursday afternoon following a diplomatic note sent by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.Cricket Association of Nepal (CAN) had requested the government and other stakeholders to take initiatives after Lamichhane was initially denied a visa last week.CAN confirmed Lamichhane’s visa denial in a press release on Thursday.“Despite taking necessary initiatives, along with the diplomatic note, from the government of Nepal, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ministry of Youth and Sports, National Sports Council, CAN and International Cricket Council (ICC) for cricketer Sandeep Lamichhane’s visit to participate in the 2024 ICC Men's T20 World Cup in the United States and West Indies, the US Embassy has expressed its inability to give travel permission (visa) to national player Lamichhane to play the World Cup,” CAN stated. After initially denying visa to Lamichhane, the embassy had said it could not comment on individual visa cases ‘as visa records are confidential under US law.’“The US Embassy in Kathmandu and other US consular posts around the world have made a concerted effort to ensure that members of national cricket teams who qualify for the appropriate visa class are able to travel in time to compete in the World Cup,” the embassy said last week.“We cannot comment on individual visa cases as visa records are confidential under US law.”Lamichhane’s supporters had taken to streets on Wednesday to express their disappointment over visa denial to the cricketer.The country’s cricket governing body had submitted a list of only 14 players to the ICC on the May 25 deadline, leaving one slot for Lamichhane in hope that the cricketer would get a visa.The former national cricket team captain was not included in the provisional squad because the Kathmandu District Court had convicted him of raping a girl in a hotel in Kathmandu in August 2022 and had sentenced him to eight years in jail in January this year.CAN had lifted suspension on Lamichhane clearing his path to participate in the national and international cricket after Patan High Court acquited him of rape on appeal earlier this month.The cricket body had immediately started preparation to send Lamichhane to the US after lifting his ban.CAN had also talked to the ICC and secured approval from the world cricket governing body to include Lamichhane in the World Cup squad if he received a visa.Before the rape trial, Lamichhane had enjoyed a glittering career. He is the first and the only Nepali cricketer to play in the Indian Premier League. He was also sought after by T20 leagues around the globe. However, Lamichhane’s success came to a sudden fall when ‘Gaushala 26’—the name police gave to the victim—filed a rape complaint against him.Lamichhane was in Trinidad & Tobago to play in the Caribbean Premier League from Jamaica Tallawahs when the rape complaint was filed.Following the rape charge and subsequent arrest warrant issued by the Kathmandu District Court, CAN had dismissed Lamichhane as national captain and suspended him from cricket.He returned to the national team in February last year and participated in the ICC Men’s Cricket World Cup League 2 home tri-series against Namibia and Scotland, after he was freed on bail.He also travelled to Zimbabwe in June last year to participate in the ICC Cricket World Cup Qualifier and to India to play the 2023 Asia Cup three months later.Lamichhane was part of the squad that reached the semi finals of the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup Asia Qualifier in October last year to book their ticket to the T20 World Cup after a decade. Nepal made their World Cup debut in World T20 in Bangladesh in 2014.He was again suspended from cricketing activities after Kathmandu District Court convicted him in the rape charge.Lamichhane’s visa rejections means the current 15-member team, who are already in the United States, will likely play the T20 World Cup.Nepal, drawn in Group D, begin their T20 World Cup against the Netherlands on June 4 in Dallas, followed by group matches against Sri Lanka on June 12, South Africa on June 15 and Bangladesh on June 17.The US will host 16 group games in three venues—Florida, Texas and New York—while the rest of the tournament including the Super Eight stage, semi-finals and the final will be held in the West Indies. \nNepal will take on the United States on Thursday in their final warmup match in Dallas ahead of the 2024 ICC Men’s T20 World Cup. The Rhinos are scheduled to begin their World Cup campaign by playing against the Netherlands on June 4.On Wednesday, the Nepali squad, including nine players who attended the training session, exerted themselves at the Mustangs Cricket Academy in Dallas. The team was notably relieved by the return of Dipendra Singh Airee, whose presence is expected to significantly bolster the squad’s performance. Airee had sustained an ankle injury in St. Vincent, West Indies. His absence extended to the practice match in Houston, US, where he was unable to participate.“Airee has returned to training today and looked in good form. So he will play against the United States,” said skipper Rohit Paudel after the training.Nepal began their preparations for the 2024 ICC Men’s T20 World Cup with a heavy 63-run warm-up defeat against Canada at the Grand Prairie Stadium in Texas on Monday. “We are ready for the match against the United States. We have struggled in the batting in power plays,” said Paudel. “I am confident that we will also do well in the World Cup with these two warm up games.”Paudel stressed Nepal’s unique advantage in these warm up matches, particularly since they are taking place on the same ground where Nepal will face the Netherlands on June 4. According to him, this provides the team with a valuable opportunity to familiarise themselves with the conditions and make strategies accordingly.This will mark the United States’ first warm up game ahead of the World Cup. Their previous warm up match against Bangladesh was washed out by rain, with no single ball bowled. The United States will begin their World Cup campaign against Canada in the inaugural match of the tournament on June 1.Photos: Hemanta Shrestha \nNepal began their preparations for the 2024 ICC Men’s T20 World Cup with a heavy 63-run warm up defeat against Canada at the Grand Prairie Stadium in Texas on Monday, thanks to their batting consistencies that have come back to haunt them since the turn of the year.Last year, Nepal’s batting won the hearts of many when they pulled off a sensational comeback to win 11 out of 12 matches of the ICC Men’s Cricket World Cup League 2 and qualified for the ICC Men’s Cricket World Cup Qualifier. The Rhinos also qualified for their maiden Asia Cup and ended the year by securing their ticket to the T20 World Cup for the first time since 2014.But all that steel and resilience now seem to have suddenly vanished into the thin air.The year 2024 has been a rollercoaster ride for Rohit Paudel’s Rhinos, even in their roaring and perfect hunting ground—TU Cricket Ground, Kirtipur. They opened the League 2 with a loss against Namibia which ended their 15-match winning streak at home and won only one of their four matches of the home tri-series.They also failed to qualify for the 2025 Asia Cup last month and a four-wicket defeat to less fancied side Hong Kong in the third-place playoff of the ACC Men’s T20 Premier Cup also banished them out of the 2024 ACC Emerging Teams Asia Cup.One of their memorable moments came when they swept the three-match bilateral series against Canada in Kirtipur in their opening event of the year.However, their batting has been characterised by unsteadiness since and it was out in the open again against Canada in their first warm-up match of the T20 World Cup.Nepal’s bowling unit has been their strength always and proved key in the middle overs on Monday as well when they struck five times in the space of 27 deliveries limiting Canada from 111-2 in the 14th over to 135-7 in the 18th over, with Abinash Bohara taking 2-27, and Karan KC, Sompal Kami, Gulsan Jha, Lalit Rajbanshi and Sagar Dhakal all picking up one wicket each.Nicholas Kriton’s 50 runs off 39 balls and opener Navneet Dhaliwal’s 32 runs off 27 balls had driven Canada past 100 to give them a great start.Despite a tight bowling from Nepal, Ravinderpal Singh’s explosive 17-ball 41 guided Canada to 183-7.Nepal could never stay in the chase of an 184-run target.Opener Kushal Bhurtel and Aasif Sheikh struggled again and departed making 10 (16) and 22 (22), respectively.Skipper Paudel has been the most consistent batter for Nepal. He was Nepal’s leading run-scorer last year with 403 T20I runs from 13 innings and was facing Canada having scored 265 runs from four innings that included a century and two half-centuries—all of which came during the five-match T20 series West Indies A.He was out for a duck in his last outing—the fifth T20 against West Indies A—and failed to make a mark again after being dismissed for one.Sundeep Jora (6), Jha (0), Kami (4), Dhakal (5) and Bohara (0) all handled the bat poorly and returned to the pavilion with single digit scores, as Nepal could not only manage 120 runs.Canada’s Dilon Heyliger returned the match figures of 4-20 in this 2.3 over spell. Jeremy Gordon and Saad Bin Zafar took two wickets each while Kaleem Sana and Pragat Singh pocketed one wicket apiece.Malla and Dipendra Singh Airee also had a golden year in 2023.During the Asian Games, Malla scored a century off just 34 balls against Mongolia. The score stands as the second fastest T20I century. Malla scored 402 runs in his 12 innings last year. After struggling with the bat most of this year, he is regaining his shape gradually at a perfect time. He top-scored against Canada with 37 runs off 30 balls, carrying his form from this last match against West Indies A where he scored a valiant 37 not out off 18 balls.Airee is Nepal’s highest run-scorer in the T20Is with 1626 runs from 56 innings. He scored a 50 off just nine balls against Mongolia last year to break the record for fastest fifty in T20s. A month ago, the big-hitting finisher smashed six sixes in an over during the Premier Cup against Qatar, joining the ranks of Yuvraj Singh and Kieron Pollard in achieving the rare feat in men’s T20I. Airee did not bat against Canada.Anil Sah’s batting does not look like a bigger concern. He was outstanding again and comfortably scored 24 runs off 16 balls. He returned to the national team for Nepal’s home series against Canada in February and immediately made an impact with a fifty and an unbeaten century. Although he lost his form following the Canada series win, he has refound his confidence lately. He scored a half-century against West Indies A in what was his last inning before the Canada warm up.Nepal will face co-hosts United States in their second warm-up game on Thursday.Nepal, drawn in Group D, begin their T20 World Cup against the Netherlands on June 4 in Dallas, followed by group matches against Sri Lanka on June 12, South Africa on June 15 and Bangladesh on June 17.Nepal are making only their second appearance at a cricket World Cup—their first since World T20 in Bangladesh in 2014. \nNarendra Modi's alliance is projected for a narrow parliamentary majority, with BJP falling short of its own majority and financial markets in turmoil due to uncertainty over policy-making and governance.\nIndian stocks plummeted ~8% as vote counting shows PM Modi's BJP unlikely to win a majority, leading to market uncertainty with Nifty and BSE indices posting significant losses.\nNepal's book market is rampant with unauthorized translations of popular international works, including those by Bangladeshi-Swedish author Taslima Nasrin, despite copyright laws prohibiting such practices, compromising the quality of literature and harming authors and legitimate publishers.\nBharat Budha, chair of Putha Uttarganga Rural Municipality’s ward 10, knows that many youths from his village have made it to the United States via ‘tallo bato’—backdoor route—and that many are still on the way. He also knows that eight of them have been deported from the country and that they have lost a cumulative Rs45 million in the process. The deported youths say that they returned home empty-handed after facing unspeakable ordeals and lost Rs6 million each on average.The Tak village in Rukum East—a close-knit settlement of 425 houses—was considered the Maoists’ ‘base area’ during the insurgency. Village youths who reached the US through illegal routes and got deported have lost an estimated Rs40 million. The number of those who returned without completing the journey and the amount they lost remain unknown.To get to the US, the youths have taken loans at up to 36 percent interest per annum from their relatives and village landowners. In Tak village, at least one person each from half of the households has gone abroad, Budha said. “Youths started going to America about six-seven years ago,” he said. “If they could gather enough money, the whole village would try to go to the US.” Budha’s own son had reached the US illegally in 2017, spending Rs3.2 million.During the insurgency, outsize slogans of revolution would adorn the walls of houses in the village. Hoping for a better life, people from all walks of life helped out the Maoists. But now, village youths are paying the agents to illegally get to the US—a country that the Maoists used to call their ‘enemy’, an ‘imperialistic force’. This has cost the Tak village much and in multiple ways.Death of a dreamSome of the deported youths have chosen to flee the village altogether, burdened with debt and creditors’ pressure. At least five such families have already left, said a resident. The family of Ram Budha was one of them. On April 28, 2015, Ram, who had returned to Nepal after working in Malaysia for eight years, took the illegal route to the US. He travelled through arduous trails for months and finally arrived in the country. Upon reaching the country, he was detained and had to stay at the detention camp for 27 months. When his refugee application was rejected, he was deported to Nepal in mid-December 2019. He lost Rs4.5 million in the process. He now owes over Rs6 million to creditors. “After the creditors began to put pressure on me, I couldn’t live in the village peacefully,” said Ram, who currently runs a vegetable farm in Tarakeshwar, Kathmandu.While those who got to the US through illegal routes and fortunately got refugee status there narrate their stories with pride, those who have been deported or returned from half-way have tragic tales to tell.Nanda Kala Gharti, who lives in a small stone house on the upper flank of Tak village, spends her days in melancholy. Her husband, Dhanlal, had chosen to take the illegal route to the US, and Nanda Kala, a mother of four, is living with the repercussions of his decision. Dhanlal had got into the US after a six-month long arduous journey and was detained immediately. He had to spend four years in the detention camp, before he was deported to Nepal. He had already lost Rs6 million.Nanda Kala said they now have an insurmountable crisis in their hands. Pointing to her son, she exclaimed, “When will he grow up, go abroad and pay back the loans!”Dhanlal himself tried to go to Croatia once and spent 15 days in Kathmandu for the process. But after he was turned down, he returned home dejected. “Now we will submit the passport to another agent [for Dhanlal’s trip abroad],” Nanda Kala said. “There’s no point staying here.”Stories that echo each otherThe situation in Sisne Rural Municipality is similar to that of Putha Uttarganga. Here, one can hear plenty of stories of those who have tried to go to the US and those who are fighting refugee cases there. Krishna Regmi, chair of the rural municipality, personally knows seven people who have been deported from the US.Gangaram Khadka, a resident of Sisne-3, runs a bee and chicken farm. Like other young men in his village, Khadka had headed off to the US via an illegal route on 27 March, 2018. He had reached the US via the New Delhi-Moscow-Barcelona-Bogota-Panama-Costa Rica-Nicaragua-Honduras-Guatemala-Mexico route. When he finally arrived in the US, he was detained and had to spend 11 months in detention. He was deported on 15 March, 2019. He had handed over Rs3.2 millions to the agent and spent Rs2 million to fight the case to become a refugee. “It’s not possible for me to pay back the loan while working in Nepal,” he said. “I aim to pay back some interest and head off abroad again.”For six months after Khadka was deported, he had anxiety and headache, he said, adding the three people from his village who were deported like him are also struggling with their mental health.Tikaram Pun, a 40-year-old resident of Bohora village in Musikot-4, is also haunted by his past journey. In September 2017, he reached the US after crossing 17 countries with the help of organised human traffickers. Of the 41 people in his group, 31 were from Rukum East and Rukum West, he said. Pun, who was detained on arrival in the US, spent 24 months in a detention camp. His refugee application was also refused and so he was deported along with eight other Nepalis. “When I returned, I started having mental health problems. I still suffer from them,” he said. Pun is under pressure from creditors and relatives to pay back the Rs9.2 million loan he had taken for the task.Those who died on the wayA group of 10 Bangladeshis and seven Nepalis, including Rupak Bohora of Bafikot-3 in Rukum West, were on a mission to reach Costa Rica through Colombia, Caribbean Coast, Capuragana and Panama. But while they were crossing a sea, their boat capsized. As many as 12 died in the incident, including six Nepalis. Rupak’s wife, Geeta, learned about the incident only after six days, on 25 June, 2021.“I still don’t know what exactly happened,” said Geeta, who had been married off at age 19 and is now a mother of two daughters. The only thing she knows is that Rupak has died and she is now all alone. And that she has Rs5 million in loan taken for Rupak’s trip. She showed a picture of her husband on her phone to this scribe and said, “I only have memories.”Lack of political will and legal remediesThe concrete bridge over Chewang river is on the edge of Tak village. On the walls of the bridge are paintings of political theorists like Marx, Engels, Lenin, Stalin and Mao, and the iconic slogan, ‘Workers of the world, unite!’, below them. But the slogan appears to be at odds with life in the village. Given the phenomenon of illegal travels to the US through the help of organised human traffickers, the whole village appears to be emptying. Neither the local governments are concerned about the phenomenon nor are the political parties paying attention.Puniraj Gharti, chair of Putha Uttarganga Rural Municipality, said though the trend is worrying, there’s nothing he can do. “How could we stop them from making the trip when they are struggling to make a living in the village?” he said.Krishna Regmi, chair of Sisne Rural Municipality, said that the vicious cycle of poverty started after marijuana farming was banned in the country. Then the Maoist insurgency added to the woe, forcing youths to migrate. The signing of the peace agreement in 2006 didn’t herald any change in the economy either and youths are struggling to get jobs. Organised human traffickers are cashing in on this sorry state of affairs, Regmi said. “Meter byajis [usurious lenders] are also promoting this phenomenon,” he added.The phenomenon is equally rife in Dang’s Tulsipur and Ghorahi. Ramesh Kumar Pandey, chair of Ghorai-15, says that even though many heading to the US are swindled, no complaints are filed at the ward office. “Only those who attempt to go to Saudi Arabia or Qatar file the complaints,” he said.One can infer from Pandey’s statements that the families of such illegal travellers don’t want to publicise the ordeals of their family members. On the one hand, agents threaten them to not publicise the issue; on the other, they fear they themselves would be punished by law.According to the Anti-Human Trafficking Bureau, as many as 178 Nepalis, including 174 men, have been deported from the US in the five fiscal years after 2018-19. Of them, the highest 49 are from Rukum while 37 are from Dang. The data doesn’t include those who returned after making it to the half-way or those who have been fighting the legal battle in the US for refugee status. But this data is enough to show that many such youths are from the ‘base areas’ of the Maoist insurgency.SSP Jeevan Shrestha, chief of the bureau, said that data on the number of such victims and the amounts they have spent is hard to collect since complaints are rarely filed with the police. “This is human trafficking but for a lack of law, we are still compelled to launch the cases as per Human Trafficking and Transportation (Control) Act 2074 BS,” Shrestha said. “The Act provides a maximum penalty of Rs250,000 for the offenders and 50 percent of that as compensation to the victims.” Without specific law, police also invoke the theft and organised crime act to punish the offenders, he added.On the one hand, police receive no complaints; on the other, the phenomenon sees no control.Bhaskar Gautam, a political scientist, says the rise in cases of human trafficking in the insurgency’s ‘base areas’ is due to the political system’s abject failure.While the Maoists raised issues related to livelihood, nationalism and a new kind of democracy to fuel their war machine, after the peace process, it is livelihoods that have been hit the hardest, Gautam said. “The traditional way of life and economy took a hit during the insurgency,” he said. “Developments after the peace process also failed to address that. What sprang up was organised human trafficking.”(Mahesh KC in Rukum East and Durgalal KC in Dang contributed to this report.)This report is prepared in collaboration with the Center for Investigative Journalism-Nepal. \nGyanumaya BK, a 69-year-old laborer, is stuck paying debts due to excessive medical expenses despite hospitals being mandated to provide free treatment to the underprivileged, which most private hospitals in Pokhara, Chitwan, Biratnagar, and Butwal disregard due to lax monitoring by regulatory bodies.\nNepal's FY2024-25 budget acknowledges economic challenges but lacks credible solutions, resulting in a huge deficit and limited transformative project funding.\nWhile Ireland, Norway, and Spain recently recognized Palestine with pre-1967 borders, Nepal has already recognized Palestine in 1988 and has not revoked its recognition.\nPatriarchal male political figures have repeatedly marginalized strong, independent women in politics, silencing their voices and undermining their leadership abilities.\nNepal faces a public health crisis with the continued availability of tainted Indian spices, despite a ban, exposing consumers to cancer-causing ethylene oxide and raising concerns about the lack of food safety regulations.\nAmidst opposition pressure and media scrutiny, a parliamentary committee has been formed to investigate allegations of cooperative fraud against Home Minister Rabi Lamichhane, excluding his name despite being central to the case.\nKailash Sirohiya, arrested for alleged document forgery, is released after 9 days, exposing a crisis in civic engagement due to fears of silencing critical voices and democratic backsliding.\nLawmaker Jivan Pariyar, a joint general secretary of the Nepali Congress, the main opposition, was a member of the four-member taskforce that prepared the terms of reference (ToR) of the parliamentary committee to probe the cooperative scam. The taskforce finalised it after a prolonged dispute over whether to categorically mention Deputy Prime Minister and Home Minister Rabi Lamichhane’s name while defining the committee’s jurisdiction. The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal talked to him about the ToR finalisation process and other aspects of the probe. It took weeks to finalise the ToR and jurisdiction of the parliamentary committee formed to probe the cooperative scam. How did you finally reach an agreement? I will give a brief context first. Cases of cooperative frauds had been made public even in the past. But this time, some groups and gangs were seen to be working in an organised way to embezzle billions of rupees deposited by common people. Some established people, including those active in politics, were found to be misusing the people’s hard-earned money. This issue was thus urgent and our party Nepali Congress raised it strongly in Parliament. We had raised this issue even when we were in the government [before March 4]. We had raised it with erstwhile home minister Narayankaji Shrestha in parliamentary committees and other platforms. We had talked to him about the involvement of lawmakers and other politicians in such scams.But the Congress raised this issue more strongly after the party quit the government.This is true, and for a good reason. We demanded a parliamentary committee to probe this issue after our party’s exit from the government because Rabi Lamichhane, someone linked with some big cooperative scams, became home minister. We raised this issue after he was allowed to lead the same ministry and police agencies that were supposed to be investigating the scams. Earlier, various agencies within Nepal Police and other government bodies were looking into the matter. Erstwhile home minister Shrestha had assured us of an independent and fair investigation. Lamichhane transferred police officials who were investigating the scams, and tried to protect cooperative operators involved in wrongdoing. Based on all these activities, we concluded that a parliamentary probe committee is a must and we firmly stood for the same. Initially, we raised this issue in Parliament without obstructing House proceedings but the government compelled us to disrupt the meetings after it refused to address our concerns. The prime minister tried to give Lamichhane a clean chit by saying that he was not involved in the cooperative scams. Also, the Nepal Police chief at a parliamentary committee meeting said that the home minister wasn’t under investigation as he had done nothing wrong. In the meantime, the attorney general issued a letter stating that no cooperative-related case was registered against Lamichhane. It became clear that the government agencies wouldn’t investigate the issue independently. Then, we raised the issue strongly and we even had to obstruct Parliament meetings. After the pressure, top leaders from the ruling as well as opposition parties agreed to form a parliamentary committee to investigate the matter. The leaders formed a task force led by Law, Justice and Parliamentary Affairs Minister Padam Giri and entrusted us with preparing the committee’s ToR and defining its jurisdiction.But at the task force meetings, members from the ruling parties lobbied to define the committee’s jurisdiction in a way that only allowed for investigation into the wrongdoings of cooperatives and their operators but not those involved in syphoning money from there through illegal means. They argued that only those who issued the loans should be made liable, not those who obtained it. Their intent was to protect Rabi Lamichhane. But I insisted that our duty is to find where the common people’s money has been spent or misused and then to return the money to the depositors. I insisted on investigating Lamichhane as various studies have shown his involvement in the misuse of depositors’ money.Then, we started exchanging written proposals. We exchanged and discussed many such proposals in writing. We insisted on mentioning the names of Lamichhane and the Gorkha Media Network—where Lamichhane and GB Rai invested tens of millions of cooperatives’ money—and ensuring that the depositors get their money back. After a long negotiation, members from the UML became a bit flexible. But the Rastriya Swatantra Party of Lamichhane continued to be rigid. Then, we finally agreed to mention the names of the cooperatives from where Lamichhane and his former colleagues had obtained money and to name Gorkha Media Network but not Lamichhane.But won’t keeping out the name of the sitting home minister create more confusion and disputes?There is no need to be confused. The ToR has stated the name of Gorkha Media Network, where Lamichhane and his team invested the money they got from the cooperatives, and the ToR’s Annex-2 has a list of cooperatives from where they obtained the money. It has also stated that “responsible officials of the company” involved in such transactions would also be investigated. Even other firms and individuals linked to the transactions will be probed. So there is no chance of keeping Lamichhane away from investigation. The committee’s jurisdiction defined in the ToR is clear on this.Will your party ask for Lamichhane’s resignation after the committee starts investigating him?Our party is yet to formally demand the home minister’s resignation. But questions have been raised about him in Parliament, in various public platforms and in the media. Also, the general public has raised this issue. He knows the committee will summon him for interrogation. A few months ago, when a minister [from Congress] was summoned by the Commission for Investigation of Abuse of Authority, Lamichhane was the one who strongly demanded the minister’s resignation in Parliament. He will soon face the parliamentary inquiry committee. Let’s see how he faces it. Leaders from ruling parties including the prime minister have accused the Congress of personally targeting Lamichhane after he refused to join a Congress-led coalition in which he was offered the prime ministerial position.Leaders from new parties should understand that political leaders engage in dialogue with all political forces. Some meetings are convened in a strategic way. This is natural in a democracy. Also, Lamichhane met with our party president. But they spread a rumour that our party president offered him the prime ministerial position. That’s not true. The argument that we targeted him after he refused to join our coalition is baseless. The Congress has officially decided that the probe committee can investigate any of our members suspected of wrongdoings. Has any other party made such a decision officially? We have also officially challenged the home minister to prove the allegations he labelled at our party leaders from Parliament’s rostrum. We have also challenged him to investigate and prove the charges.When the names of head and members of the parliamentary probe committee became public, many thought that the parties didn’t give due importance to the panel as they nominated relatively low-profile lawmakers. Why didn’t the parties choose powerful leaders to investigate a national crisis of this magnitude?This is a wrong perception. All members are federal parliamentarians. They shouldn’t be judged based on their personalities and profiles. The committee is powerful because it has a mandate from the House, and its jurisdiction and the ToR give it power. What we should carefully follow is their work. They can invite experts and specialists—such as chartered accountants, bankers, account specialists—if they require technical expertise during the investigation.Lamichhane himself is chair of the fourth-largest party, which has a decisive role in the ruling coalition. Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal and CPN-UML chair KP Sharma Oli had initially ruled out any need of investigation into the home minister. In this context, can the committee members freely conduct the investigation?I am confident that even the committee member from the RSP can’t defend his leader when the documents and facts show that the money was illegally released. How can other members protect him? I believe they will conduct the investigation independently and come up with a consensus report. Documents, facts and figures guide investigation. This isn’t like leaders giving statements on public platforms. We are not saying he must be proven guilty as the Congress has blamed him. He may prove to be innocent after investigation. We should accept if the evidence proves Lamichhane innocent. The bottom line is that the investigation should be fair. Many Congress leaders are also involved in cooperative scams and other corruption cases. So people suspect that leaders will eventually trade off and the probe panel will be only an eyewash.This investigation cannot be weakened under any pretext. I am saying this based on the documents and evidence I have studied. Also, the media and other stakeholders such as the study report of Pokhara Metropolitan City and the investigation report of Rupandehi District Police, among others, have already made ample evidence public. It’s not easy to acquit the guilty.What will Congress’ approach be if the committee, where ruling parties have a majority, fails to decide by consensus and members take decisions on a majority basis?In the seven-member panel, there are two members from our party and one from the Rastriya Prajatantra Party. If those from the ruling parties pushed for a wrong decision based on their majority, members from opposition parties will counter that and register their differing views. If such a situation arises they will be free to make the reality public and they can even bring out a different report.Was Congress under pressure to reach an agreement as there were reports that the government was preparing to unveil the budget through ordinance citing opposition’s House obstruction?We weren’t worried about that. In fact, the prime minister’s initiatives and his seriousness to end the House deadlock played a crucial role in helping us reach this agreement. \nAmnesty International's Secretary-General's visit to Nepal highlights the global backsliding of human rights, particularly in civic space, use of force against protests, impunity, and authoritarianism, while also addressing concerns over Nepal's transitional justice process and climate change vulnerability.\nThe CPN (Unified Socialist) prepares for its first general convention amidst poor performance, ineffectiveness in government, and internal leadership tensions, while seeking to clarify policy positions and address concerns about relevance and stability in the coalition.\nUN Resident Coordinator Hanaa Singer-Hamdy highlights Nepal's progress in poverty reduction, health, and education, but acknowledges ongoing challenges in poverty, inequality, and infrastructure, while expressing optimism about LDC graduation and SDG attainment with continued partnerships and resource mobilization.\nThe federal parliament's budget session commences amidst unresolved differences over forming a probe committee on cooperative fraud allegations against Home Minister Rabi Lamichhane, with concerns about the House's productivity due to pending bills awaiting approval.\nPartly cloudy to generally cloudy weather with chances of light rain and snowfall in some areas, and clear skies elsewhere; maximum temperature recorded at 40.4°C in Dhangadi and minimum temperature at 9.5°C in Jomsom.\nRainfall in Kathmandu Valley due to local winds brought relief from the heat, while the monsoon is expected to arrive on June 13.\nToday, the weather will be generally cloudy throughout the country.Koshi, Madhesh, Bagmati and Gandaki provinces along with other hilly regions will experience partly to generally cloudy weather while the rest of the country will be partly cloudy.Light to moderate rain with thunder and lightning is likely to occur at a few places in Koshi, Madhesh, Bagmati, Gandaki and Lumbini provinces.Gandaki and Lumbini provinces will also experience gusty winds, the Meteorological Forecasting Division said.There are also chances of light snowfall in the high hilly and mountainous regions of the country.The weather will remain partly to generally cloudy in Koshi, Madhesh and Gandaki provinces, while light to moderate rain with thunder and lightning has also been forecast in these areas tonight.The rest of the country will be partly cloudy to mainly fair.As of Monday evening, Nepalgunj experienced the warmest day in the country with temperatures rising to 40.2 degrees Celsius.

Write it in the form of inspiring story not news article or event.\n    \n    Story:\nOnce upon a time, nestled between the towering peaks of the Himalayas and the lush jungles of the Terai, there was a country named Nepal. Though still a developing nation, Nepal was a land of profound beauty and deep-rooted cultural heritage. The residents of Nepal faced many challenges, but beneath these hardships lay a resilient spirit and an unyielding hope for the future.\n\nThis enchanting land, where Mount Everest reaches towards the skies and the air carries a mix of incense and cool mountain breezes, was more than a geographical marvel. It was a mosaic of cultures, languages, and traditions, a testament to human endeavor against all odds. Nepal's history, from the unification under King Prithvi Narayan Shah to its transformation into a federal democratic republic, told a story of aspiration and endurance.\n\nIn recent years, the people of Nepal, with their indomitable will, had taken strides towards rebuilding and reimagining their country. They turned their struggles into stepping stones, each challenge a chapter in their ongoing saga. The shift from a monarchy to a republic had not only changed governance but had woven a new tapestry of democratic values and collective decision-making.\n\nEconomically, while agriculture continued to sustain a large part of its population, Nepal had begun to harness the potential of its picturesque landscapes, developing sustainable tourism that promised to preserve their natural heritage while boosting local economies. Communities living in the shadows of the Himalayas had become stewards of the earth, protecting the biodiversity that made their country unique.\n\nEach day brought new stories. Whether it was a festival in Kathmandu, a technological advance in Pokhara, or a conservation effort in Chitwan, these events were threads in the vibrant quilt of Nepali life. These stories, updated daily, reflected the pulse of progress and the spirit of hope that characterized this resilient nation.\n\nAnd so, as Nepal moved forward, each moment was not just a passage of time but a promise of potential, a narrative of a nation perennially climbing towards tomorrow, guided by the legacy of its past and the dreams of its future.\n\nNews events:\nNepal lost their T20 World Cup opener to the Netherlands by six wickets, despite Rohit Paudel's 35-run knock and Max O'Dowd's 54* for the victors.\nPrime Minister Dahal plans a Cabinet reshuffle, considering replacements from coalition partners and potentially adding new faces from Nagarik Unmukti and Janamat parties, but faces resistance from the UML and Unified Socialist over a full ministerial change.\nExtreme heat in Nepal's Tarai region disrupts nationwide polio vaccination campaign for children born between April 2016 and October 2018, with officials expecting resumption after schools reopen and monsoon provides relief.\nPrime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal inaugurated the breakthrough of the Arun III Hydroelectric Project's headrace tunnel, marking the completion of a major milestone in the largest hydroelectric project in Nepal, which aims to provide clean energy and contribute to the economic development of the region.\nThe Supreme Court set June 26 as the verdict date for a writ petition challenging the government's decision to halt an investigation against former parliament speaker Agni Sapkota, accused of murdering Arjun Lama during the Maoist insurgency.\nOver a week after its formation, the parliamentary committee to investigate the misuse of public funds by various cooperatives has started drafting its working procedure necessary to commence the probe.The first meeting of the parliamentary panel on Wednesday tasked the officials of the Parliament Secretariat deputed at the committee to draft the working procedure by Thursday.“Our meeting on Friday will endorse the working procedure after reviewing the draft by the officials,” Ishwari Neupane, a member of the committee from the Nepali Congress, told the Post. “We will probably start the investigation from Sunday.”After weeks of negotiations between the ruling and the opposition parties, a seven-member committee under the leadership of CPN-UML lawmaker Surya Thapa was constituted on May 28 to investigate the embezzlement of deposits in dozens of cooperatives around the country.According to police investigations, billions of rupees from several cooperatives were transferred to the GB Rai-led Gorkha Media Network. He has fled the country, and Interpol has issued a diffusion notice against him.The committee is tasked with investigating credit cooperatives whose deposits were transferred to run the Gorkha Media Network and other organisations. \nMadhesh Chief Minister Saroj Kumar Yadav lost the position on Wednesday, 17 months after his appointment, after failing to secure the vote of confidence during the floor test in the provincial assembly.A meeting of the provincial assembly rejected the motion tabled by the chief minister seeking the trust of the assembly.Assembly Speaker Ramchandra Mandal announced that only 50 members of the assembly voted in favour of his motion while 53 voted against the chief minister. A total of 103 members were present at the meeting. In the 107-strong Madhesh Province, the support of 54 assembly members is required for a majority.Yadav, provincial assembly leader of the Janata Samajbadi Party-Nepal, which is led by Upendra Yadav, was appointed as the chief minister on January 11, 2023.The Yadav-led provincial government lost the majority after the CPN-UML and CPN (Maoist Centre) withdrew their support on May 12.The chief minister went for the floor test as per the mandatory provision of the constitution. This mandatory provision requires a chief minister to pass a floor test within 30 days if the party the chief minister represents splits or a coalition partner withdraws its support to the head of the provincial government.Earlier, Chief Minister Yadav had planned to defer the trust vote. He had requested the assembly reschedule the meeting for Monday, citing health reasons. However, he later became ready to face the assembly over fear of losing the position ‘automatically’. Leaders from rival parties had said that he would lose the position based on the date of the split of the JSP-Nepal. Last month, a group of leaders split the JSP-Nepal to form a new party under the leadership of Ashok Rai. The Election Commission recognised the Ashok Rai-led splinter group as a new party–Janata Samajbadi Party–on May 5. Then, the chief minister had become ready to secure a trust vote by today.There were also legal questions over the requirement as the Supreme Court has ordered the election body to halt the party registration process for the time being.Now, Province Chief Sumitra Bhandari will make a call for a government formation in accordance with Article 168(2) of the Constitution. The provision states that in cases where no party has a clear majority in the assembly under clause(1), the Province Head shall appoint as the chief minister a member of the assembly who can command a majority with the support of two or more parties representing the provincial assembly.The new chief minister will be required to secure the confidence of the provincial assembly within 30 days of the appointment.The Janata Samajbadi Party has been ousted from power six and a half years after the first provincial assembly elections. Previously, Lal Babu Raut of the party served a full five-year term.  \nNepal’s dairy farmers are facing renewed hardships with the government repeatedly failing to heed them. These farmers have asked for nothing more than the amount (around Rs5 billion) owed to them by private dairy companies since last August. For the same reason, the dairy farmers were compelled to spill milk in a March protest before reaching an agreement with three private dairy companies, the state-owned Dairy Development Cooperation (DDC) and the Ministry of Agriculture, to clear the payments by April 3. But all their effort went in vain, prompting them to plan yet another protest if their dues were not settled in the next two weeks.The plight of dairy farmers suggests utter neglect of this vital sector. Be it vegetable producers, sugarcane growers or dairy farmers, inadequate plans and policies to address their demands have left the farmers struggling. Reduced income has hit all aspects of the economy, and consumers are unable to buy dairy products. Even the sweltering heat, which would usually boost the demand for dairy products, has failed to do so. The government’s failure to address the core problem of the economy has had a significant impact on consumers and has spilled over to farmers.Market insiders have noted that the Pushpa Kamal Dahal-led government, without conducting proper market study, hiked the price of milk in March last year: Rs9.1 per litre in the minimum purchase price of raw milk paid to farmers, bringing the price up to Rs65.5. Following that, in the same month, DDC also set the price of half-litre milk at Rs48.50, by raising Rs5.50. However, this price is still high in Nepali market, leading many to import from the southern neighbour India. As a result, while Nepal produces over six million litres of milk a day with roughly 300,000 homes contributing, between 500,000 and 600,000 million litres go unsold due to the lack of market, as per the government’s economic survey (2023-24). The dairy farmers thus got no benefit from the price hike. The dairy companies, citing the economic crisis, don’t appear to have taken significant steps to solve this problem. They claim that their capacity to store butter is already exhausted, and they haven’t been able to buy milk and pay the farmers. During vital periods like these, the companies should have adequate storage systems to retain dairy products for high-demand times like Dashain and Tihar, explore international markets, and find new ways to attract consumers at home through quality dairy products. Additionally, the Central Dairy Cooperative Association—a key player in knocking the doors of the government to pay the rightful amount to the farmers—is yet to finalise measures to clear outstanding dues. It is not known why the government and private dairy companies haven’t settled the issue. Farmers who end up throwing milk on roads but fail to understand the demand-supply fluctuation are also to blame. Cooperatives and government authorities should work together to educate and encourage farmers to adopt agricultural insurance schemes, which cover 80 percent of the government subsidy. As an immediate measure, it is the state’s prime duty to pay attention to the farmers’ woes. Clearing the outstanding dues of Rs5 billion shouldn’t be much of a hassle considering that the sector contributes around five percent to the country’s gross domestic product.  \nThree populist parliamentarians—Oli, Lamichhane, and Shahi—manipulate popular sentiment to advance their political agendas, with Oli relying on cultural rhetoric, Lamichhane exploiting public discontent, and Shahi inciting anti-establishment sentiment.\nFossil fuels are being rapidly displaced by decarbonised sources of energy but not everyone is yet onboard. The resolution adopted at the end of COP28 last December was described as the \"beginning of the end\" for the fossil fuel era. While such an announcement was met with much cynicism, maybe it was indeed the turning point.The past six months have provided even more evidence that fossil fuels are being rapidly overcome by the new technologies of decarbonisation: Wind, solar, batteries and electric vehicles. These are now growing at super exponential rates showing that businesses, governments and communities are learning how to implement them in cities and regions.All fossil fuels are either plateauing or showing negative growth. The peaks for coal, oil and gas show how rapid their decline will be. The responses from the fossil fuel lobby have been largely of derision and instead of showing that they are in decline and must diversify into these new technologies, they have opted for even bigger growth targets.Many oil and gas projects are showing growth targets beyond 2050 into 2070, in a bid to find finance from a world that is more and more backing the net zero-only finance option as demand for fossil fuels declines.Fossil fuel lobby sows confusionThis is causing political chaos as governments are caught between supporting climate action and supporting big fossil fuel companies promising massive investment. This confuses the public. Australia is an example.In the two years since its election, the federal Labor government has created many innovative programs and funds to enable the energy transition. But at the same time it is backing oil and gas project expansion that is seven times more climate-damaging than the gains in climate mitigation from the other programs.Chevron's carbon capture and storage project at the Gorgon gas field—the biggest demonstration of the technology in the world—has failed to meet its targets, casting doubt on the continued use of gas.Overviews of the technology are increasingly casting doubts on its commercial viability. Due to their impact on the global climate it is hard to see more than a small fraction of the fossil fuel projects ever getting their finance. It’s thus likely the fossil fuel lobby strategy to push ahead—as though COP28 never happened—will begin to collapse. It's expected that COP29 will confirm the support for a rapid decline in fossil fuels.Risk of COP29 backfiringLike COP28 it will be convened by an oil and gas-based nation. But the data are beginning to make the campaigns for more fossil fuels look like childish tantrums. And the natural world has been fighting back with the climate causing severe storms like the huge floods that hit Dubai in the months after COP28. No place is safe from global warming.Finance will have the major stake as they must invest in returns that last into the 2050s and these are increasingly threatened by the data trends and the climate itself.The Australian oil and gas company Woodside had 58 percent of its shareholders vote down the company's climate strategy, including its dependence on carbon capture and storage. COP29 will backfire unless more is agreed to accelerate the phase out of fossil fuels.Fossil fuel companies will increasingly find that unless they seriously join the diversification of their investments, they will disappear.The examples of Orsted in Denmark and Neste in Finland have demonstrated diversification to renewable-based fuels is commercially feasible by companies that previously worked on fossil fuels. Much more is needed and can be expected at COP29.UN climate chief Simon Stielle has put the world on notice: \"We've got two years left to save the planet. As we inch towards the point of no return, each year takes on more importance than the last.\" But the first steps were taken at COP28 by recognising that the era of fossil fuels is over. \nChiefs and deputy chiefs of over 150 local units from across the country have gathered in Kathmandu for a common agenda—to protest against the federal government’s decision to cut the budget already allocated to them. They picketed the finance ministry at Singha Durbar on Sunday to mount pressure on the federal government to release the money. According to them, the budget earmarked under the title of equalisation grants was not distributed as earlier promised. Local units get the equalisation grants in three tranches. They were entitled to 25 percent of the total grants in the third instalment, but they got only seven percent. According to elected local representatives, the federal administration’s act of cutting the allocated budget has caused them multiple problems as they had initiated several development projects and other activities with a plan to pay with the money from the equalisation grants. With the abrupt disruption of the source, they are now in a spot of bother. The finance ministry might have its own arguments behind stopping the budget, most likely a shortfall of resources as successive governments have failed to rejuvenate the country’s economy after the covid pandemic. The Pushpa Kamal Dahal government has been a failure on the economic front as it couldn’t even meet the target of revenue collection set in the annual budget. Nepali authorities have failed to apply any innovative idea or explore new resources to fill the gap. The authorities in Kathmandu could have found other ways such as applying austerity measures at the centre so as to avoid budget cuts to the local units. For one, cutting local units’ budgets won’t help the government’s goal of increasing capital expenditures.There are several options to fund development and other activities at the district, constituency and local levels. Allocation of the budget through equalisation grants is one. It is a more scientific and rational way of resource distribution as it is done in line with clear working procedures of the National Natural Resources and Finance Commission. The latest status of human development indicators including the situation of education, health and drinking water of a particular local unit or province; the situation of balanced development there; that of disparity based on economic, social or any other discrimination; the condition of infrastructure in the province and local units; the existing status and prospect of revenue generation; and the need of expenditure for the sub-national units are the criteria considered while allocating funds.The commission also takes the population of a sub-national unit as a basis to allocate budget under this category. For instance, units with less than 10,000 people get Rs1.25 million while those with more than 10,000 and upto 2 million people get additional Rs125,000 for each 10,000 increment. This shows that distribution of money under equalisation grants is to an extent rational whereas several other programmes are infamous for doling out money based on recommendation and influence of powerful political leaders and top officials at Singha Durbar.By cutting resources to local units, the government is treading a regressive path by weakening sub-national administrations—at a time it needs to devolve more authorities and resources to strengthen them as per the spirit of the federal system. The local representatives, while speaking during the sit-in at the ministry, accused the authorities of shifting development and other responsibilities to the local units while centralising resources at Singha Durbar. They are right to say that such a tendency will neither strengthen the federal system nor does it sit well with the spirit of the new constitution.  \nExit polls could not accurately capture discontent among the social and economic castes that are ranked lower in India in key states, resulting in an overestimation of electoral support for Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s ruling party, two pollsters said.The findings led to turmoil in Indian stock markets on Tuesday, after rosier projections for Modi in the general election earlier boosted markets.Three of five polls initially projected Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party would win more than the 303 electoral seats it won in 2019, while the opposition “INDIA” alliance led by Rahul Gandhi’s Congress party would win 125 to 182 seats.The predictions boosted financial markets ahead of the release of elections results on Tuesday.However, vote counts showed much lower numbers - around 240 for the BJP and 293 for Modi’s alliance that includes regional parties. That caused the worst intraday fall in stocks since March 2020 on concerns over challenges for implementing economic reforms due to Modi’s dependence on allies.Pradeep Gupta, head of Axis My India poll agency, said the survey failed to capture a shift among voters in the less privileged sections of society in Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal and Maharashtra states, where 170 seats in total were up for grabs, and where BJP lost a whopping 45 seats, compared to 2019.“This is our mistake,” Gupta said.He noted many voters in those sections of society didn’t disclose their voting decisions for fear of being attacked by electoral workers who did not share their political views.“We could not predict as accurately as we are known for,” he said, referring to challenges in capturing how voters had swung in favour of the opposition from other regional parties.Over 900 people were deployed for face-to-face post-ballot interviews with a sample of 582,000 voters, with the response rate varying from 40-50% in urban areas and 70-80% in rural areas, Gupta said.Many women voters asked males in their families to respond on their behalf, resulting in wrong estimations of their voting decisions, he said.“We are wrong in 2024,” said Yashwant Deshmukh, head of CVoter polling agency, whose numbers were overestimated by about 50 seats in favour of Modi’s party amid incorrect projections for Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan.“I wish I could stop giving seat numbers but that’s a professional hazard” as the media keeps asking for those estimates, Deshmukh said. \nThe British Embassy in Kathmandu on Tuesday held an event to mark the centenary of the 1924 Mt Everest expedition.The British Embassy in Kathmandu said in a statement that a photo exhibition about the 1924 expedition was mounted at the embassy on Tuesday.Entitled ‘The Fight for Everest 1924,’ it was first displayed at the Kathmandu International Mountain Film Festival (Kimff) last week. The collection will be permanently displayed at the Pokhara-based International Mountain Museum.Speaking at the event at the embassy, Ambassador Rob Fenn commented that, although the 1924 expedition had not come to Kathmandu, Nepalis played an important role in it and “have continued to be pivotal in Everest attempts since.”“Britons are besotted with raw courage. It’s what has been drawing us to Nepal and to Nepalis for more than two hundred years,” he said.Ambassador Fenn shared news announced in the UK in December that Nepalis are now eligible to apply for expedition funding from the UK-based Mount Everest Foundation (www.mef.org.uk/news/mef-opens-grants-to-nepali-applicants). Since its inception in 1955, the MEF has provided funds to over 2,000 expeditions in remote locations and to scientists researching high-altitude medicine, glaciology and climate change. \nPrime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal, Nepali Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba and CPN-UML chair KP Sharma Oli have congratulated Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi for the third-term victory of Modi’s party in the 2024 elections.Dahal took to X to ‘note the successful completion of the world’s largest democratic exercise with the enthusiastic participation of the people of India’ as Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party won 240 seats in the 543-member lower house.The BJP-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) secured 293 seats, more than 20 ahead of the 272 needed to form a government.“Congratulations to PM @narendramodi on the electoral success of BJP and NDA in the Loksabha elections for the third consecutive term,” reads the prime minister’s post.Congress President Deuba, who is also the leader of the main opposition, took to social media X to congratulate the Indian prime minister. “Congratulations to @narendramodi ji, a great friend of Nepal, on securing a third consecutive term as Prime Minister of India following the BJP and NDA's victory,” former prime minister Deuba wrote on Wednesday. “Your leadership, dedication, and vision continue to inspire and shape a bright future for India.”Likewise, CPN-UML chair KP Sharma Oli joined the leaders to greet the Indian leader. “I congratulate the Indian people for their great democratic exercise. I wish for your continued success in driving India’s progress and prosperity,” former prime minister Oli said on X. \nA man attempted self-immolation in Kathmandu after allegedly setting his own family on fire on Tuesday.According to Deputy Superintendent of Police Keshav Thebe, 55-year-old Chanchal Bahadur Singh, in an inebriated state, sprinkled kerosene over his wife Bindu, and their three daughters, aged 24, 16 and eight, and set them on fire in Saraswatinagar of Chabahil.Singh then attempted self-immolation, police said.All of them have been admitted to the Kirtipur Hospital for treatment.The 24-year-old and the teenager have been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) as they have sustained 55 percent and 80 percent burns to their bodies, respectively.The others have sustained eight to 10 percent burn wounds, the hospital said. \nIsraeli shelling and airstrikes killed at least 19 people in central and south Gaza on Tuesday including two policemen who were helping protect humanitarian aid deliveries in the southern city of Rafah, Palestinian medics said.Seventeen of the deaths, they said, occurred in separate Israeli airstrikes on the al-Bureij and al-Maghazi refugee camps and the city of Deir-al-Balah in central Gaza, and by late Tuesday tanks were shelling an area just east of the al-Nusseirat camp, residents said.Some told Reuters via chat app that the renewed Israeli military push was sowing panic, with some families living in al-Maghazi starting to flee under tank fire, with four shells crashing near a clinic in the camp.In a brief statement issued earlier in the day, the Israeli military said jets were hitting Hamas militant targets in central Gaza while ground forces were operating “in a focused manner with guidance from intelligence” in the al-Bureij area.It gave no update on activity in Rafah, into which Israeli forces swept last month in what the military calls a limited operation to root out Hamas’ last intact combat units after almost eight months of devastating war in the Gaza Strip.The small city fringing Gaza’s southern border with Egypt had been sheltering about one million Palestinians who fled Israeli assaults in other parts of the enclave, but most have fled again in the face of Israel's tank-led advance.Israel launched an air and ground offensive in Gaza last October vowing to destroy Hamas after militants stormed across the border into southern Israel on October 7, killing around 1,200 people and taking more than 250 people hostage, according to Israeli tallies. About 120 hostages remain in Gaza.The Israeli military campaign has killed more than 36,000 people in densely populated Gaza, according to its health authorities, who say thousands more bodies are buried under rubble.Qatar said on Tuesday it had delivered an Israeli ceasefire proposal to Hamas that reflected a three-phase proposal presented on Friday by US President Joe Biden, and that the paper was now much closer to the positions of both sides.Qatar, which has been mediating on Gaza between Israel and Hamas, also stressed that there should be a clear position from both parties to clinch a deal, its foreign ministry spokesperson said in a press briefing.“The ceasefire deal should immediately end the long suffering of all people in Gaza and the hostages and their families and provide a roadmap for a permanent ceasefire and an end to the (humanitarian) crisis”, Majed al-Ansari said.However, a spokesman for Hamas, the Islamist militant group that has ruled Gaza since 2007, reiterated on Tuesday it could not agree to any deal unless Israel makes a “clear” commitment to a permanent truce and complete withdrawal from Gaza.For his part, Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu repeated that there can be no permanent peace unless Hamas is eradicated, as he struggles with profound political divisions at home over the US-backed truce proposal.An aide to Netanyahu said on Sunday Israel had accepted the framework advanced by Biden, though he described it as flawed and in need of much more work.On Tuesday, his biggest coalition partner said it would support such a deal even if it entails an overhaul of the war strategy. But Netanyahu’s far-right allies in the government threatened to bolt and bring it down if he wound down the Gaza war without having annihilated Hamas.Biden’s framework proposal involves in its first stage a six-week ceasefire when Israeli forces would withdraw from “all populated areas” of Gaza and some hostages - including the elderly and women - would be freed by Hamas in exchange for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners.Under that plan, Hamas and Israel would negotiate in the same phase a permanent ceasefire that Biden said would last “as long as Hamas lives up to its commitments.”In the second phase, Biden said there would be an exchange for all remaining living hostages, including male soldiers, Israeli forces would withdraw from Gaza and the permanent ceasefire would begin. The last stage of the plan would include the reconstruction of the shattered coastal enclave.Biden’s Middle East envoy, Brett McGurk, will travel to the region this week to push for a hostage deal and ceasefire, a US official told Reuters on Tuesday. \nIndian Prime Minister Narendra Modi was set to meet his allies on Wednesday to discuss forming the government, a day after his Hindu nationalist party lost its outright majority in parliament in a surprise election verdict.Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) won 240 seats on its own in the general election, 32 short of the halfway mark in the 543-member decision-making lower house, according to official results announced late on Tuesday.The outcome unnerved investors, with stocks falling steeply on Tuesday, since Modi would have to depend on disparate regional parties whose political loyalties have wavered over the years.The National Democratic Alliance (NDA) led by the BJP won 293 seats, more than 20 ahead of the 272 needed to form a government.The opposition INDIA alliance led by Rahul Gandhi’s centrist Congress party won 230 seats, more than forecast. Congress alone won 99, almost double the 52 it won in 2019 - a surprise jump that is expected to boost Gandhi's standing.The INDIA alliance was also expected to meet on Wednesday in New Delhi, and discuss a future course of action.But any efforts at government formation by the opposition were likely stymied by two of the BJP’s key allies endorsing Modi and saying their pre-poll alliance with the party was intact.Addressing a crowd of cheering party workers at the party headquarters late on Tuesday evening, Modi promised to work harder in his third term.“The blessings of the people for the third time after 10 years boosts our morale, gives new strength,” he said.TURNOUT TROUBLEModi was seeking one of India’s biggest mandates in the six-week-long election after most opinion polls conducted before voting began had predicted a big victory for him, driven by his personal popularity, free cereal for the poor, new roads and bridges, and his courting of majority Hindus.But a fall in voter turnout in the first stage of the seven- phase election worried the BJP, several party officials said. A pollster, who declined to be named citing private conversations, said he got calls from “panicked” BJP officials asking if “something was going wrong. Why aren’t people coming?”.At the same time, some analysts told TV debates that opposition attempts to woo the masses with promises of affirmative action, bigger handouts and more jobs were gaining traction.That is when Modi changed tack.Having earlier focused on economic development, India's image and such issues, he switched back to accusing the opposition of favouring minority Muslims at the cost of Hindus.“I believe that the polarising campaign that the prime minister ran this time, the kind of, you know, hyped-up media outreach that he did, I think these were all signs that he was worried,” said political commentator Arati Jerath.The BJP said Modi was their best bet to put their message across.“We discussed internally how our work, economic development, India’s global image and such things sometimes do not set the narrative,” said spokesperson Agarwal.“The politics is such that other things dictate the narrative, and the BJP must also respond accordingly. For our narrative to work, the prime minister is the best communicator.”However, with the BJP falling short of a majority on its own, its promises like a uniform civil code for all religions, opposed by some Muslims, and simultaneous state and national elections, will likely be put on the back burner. They could be replaced by policies aimed at more bread-and-butter issues as its allies could demand.“Modi has seemingly lost his aura of electoral invincibility,” said Michael Kugelman, director of the Washington-based Wilson Center's South Asia Institute think tank.“He remains highly popular, and his party likely would have done even worse if he weren’t leading it. This is a leader who has repeatedly bounced back from political and policy setbacks and retained large public mandates. With the results we’re seeing today, that narrative of resilience has been dealt a big blow.” \nThese days, I watch Nepali television news more frequently and read broadsheet papers and online news to observe the clash of dreams and reality, particularly in political events. The uncanny political developments in the country have propelled the speed of these events. Little worried by the indications of the erosion of the hard-earned democratic values and practices seen in political coalitions and the assault on media freedom, I briefly review the history of political leaders' dreams and failures in this column. I want to show that we, the people, bear the brunt of history’s tragic and farcical turns. An important shift has occurred in Nepali history from the tragic to the ludicrous. Karl Marx, in his famous work The Eighteenth Brumaire Of Louis Bonaparte, said, \"All the great events and characters of history occur twice, firstly as tragedy, secondly as farce.\" No communist leaders of Nepal appear to have referred to this book and Marx's prophetic statement except Baburam Bhattarai, the erstwhile Maoist leader and comrade of the current Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal, who has recently got the vote of confidence for the fourth time in 17 months. This is an interesting episode of political farce. Political parties and the cronies who are always proactive are reducing the democratic system established by people's sacrifice and dedication to a farce. That becomes clear if we watch the drama that happens in Parliament.There is a serious part to this historical shift. Marx also says, \"The social revolution of the nineteenth century cannot create its poetry from the past but only from the future”. This means that to draw strength and meaning from the past, you should create its poetry from the future. This is a little academic point. Repetition of historyThe Nepali democracy and those who have been given the responsibility to protect and use it precisely lack that vision of futurity; they do not perceive the poetry of the future. Their actions in parliament, narrow partisan behaviours, the reckless language they use, inadequate knowledge about the political dynamics of social change and the important time they squander away by acting irresponsibly all show that they lack the vision to create poetry from the future. I have begun to wonder whether the Nepali political parties will fully utilise the democratic political system to ameliorate the condition of the people of this land.The Nepali media fraternity says the sudden arrest of Kantipur Media Group Chairman Kailash Sirohiya on May 21, 2024, is unfair and \"motivated by personal vendetta.\" The agency in question is the coalition government led by Dahal and the Home Ministry. A certain revelation occurred to me after watching an interview with Bhattarai on Kantipur television on the same night. Bhattarai recalled one article he published in Kantipur in August 2001 about the royal massacre. I was mourning my mother's death in my village, Sabala of Terathum. I read that article to my elder brother and Nepali Congress district leader, Laya Prasad Subedi, who totally agreed with Bhattarai's analysis. The underground Maoist leader Bhattarai has said in that article the murders were the result of a \"political conspiracy\". Kailash Sirohiya and his co-publisher, Binod Raj Gyawali, and the editor-in-chief of Kantipur, Yubaraj Ghimire, were arrested for publishing that. Bhattarai said in the interview that he was stunned by the drama of Sirohiya's arrest, which shows an uncanny repetition of history. This time, he said, “Prachanda is in the position of the king, and the same media person is arrested, as the common opinion says, for publishing news stories about Prachanda's government.” Bhattarai also revealed that in a prime ministerial system like ours, no such decision is taken without the prime minister's consent. It is not the minister but the prime minister who can make such decisions, he explained.Whatever the position of parties and the leaders at the current moment of history, those who have followed the political history know that Bhattarai has always made decisions according to his understanding, conscience and interpretation of history. Bhattarai had declared that he was leaving the Maoist party because, metaphorically, it was not safe to live in the red-labelled house, which was a category of the badly damaged buildings after the earthquakes of 2015. I am dismayed by the performances of Pushpa Kamal Dahal. I am getting more and more disillusioned by his actions and those of the other communist leaders of different groups who are all in the coalition now. They include communist stalwarts like Dahal, KP Sharma Oli and Madhav Kumar Nepal. There is no point in talking about the behaviour of the individual ministers, whose sense of history and the missions often don't come to the fore. The coalition’s leader and a major actor Dahal is at the centre of the decisions in this system if we believe the interpretation of the former prime minister Bhattarai.It is challenging for all political leaders to maintain a history of their choice and to live up to the expectations of the people. Dahal is no exception. I want to recall one event here. Dahal had attended the Hindustan Times Leadership Summit in Delhi in the third week of November 2006. Some people told me about him when I attended a literary conference in Delhi after that event. One professor, impressed with Dahal’s metamorphosis, gave me the news published in the paper. It cites Dahal saying, \"I have lived my life in jungle, now I will lead my life in light.\" Another report said, ''Nepal's firebrand Maoist leader Prachanda on Saturday said the political battle in the 21st century will be fought over democracy, which at present is in deep crisis.\" A euphoric Dahal, by his transformation, said while addressing the second session on the second day of the fourth Hindustan Times Leadership Summit in Delhi, \"Democracy will rule the world\". The report also said, \"The former Indian prime minister and admirer of Prachanda I. K. Gujaral says he had read about many epic stories about revolution and Prachanda has shown it by accomplishing an epic battle in Nepal.\"History says Dahal and other leaders have clearly failed to deliver. His and his various coalitions’ actions show that staying in power is their only goal. What has begun to worry nonpartisan academics and writers like us is that the power coalitions and groups only work with what Bertrand Russell calls the “lust for power.” The time has come for the free media, legal activists and civil society to be vigilant about protecting democracy.  \nThe Speaker of the House of Representatives is expected to run parliamentary proceedings impartially following democratic norms. In parliamentary tradition, after being elected, the Speaker dissociates himself or herself from the party that gave the election ticket to maintain neutrality.Speakers in Nepal, however, have often run into controversies. They have also been accused of failing to maintain neutrality while conducting parliamentary business. At times, they are accused of working at the behest of the mother party.The Speaker’s role becomes crucial in minimising inter-party rivalry that often leads to a political deadlock. Some Speakers such as Daman Nath Dhungana and Subas Nembang have successfully played that role as well.The incumbent Speaker Devraj Ghimire also faces the charge of failing to demonstrate an impartial role.On Saturday, Ghimire addressed a gathering organised by a provincial chapter of the Federation of Nepali Journalists where he said since Parliament had been held hostage, “some measures may need to be taken”. He went on to say that the government may be forced to introduce the fiscal budget through an ordinance should the House deadlock prolong.His controversial statement came ahead of political leaders’ consultations on the day as they tried to find a way out of the impasse. Soon afterwards, Ghimire attended a meeting convened by Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal with CPN-UML chair KP Sharma Oli, and Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Home Affairs Rabi Lamichhane, who is also the Rastriya Swatantra Party chief.The opposition leaders have fiercely criticised the Speaker mainly after the May 16 incident when the Congress and the UML lawmakers had a scuffle during the House meeting. A UML lawmaker, Ghimire formally disassociated himself from the party after being elected the Speaker in early 2023.Experts on parliamentary affairs say Speaker candidates must be picked carefully, analysing if they can do justice to the top position of the legislature. When the Speakers are selected on the basis of their relations with party leaders, they often take decisions to suit the leaders they are grateful to.Speaker is a crucial constitutional position, former Speaker Daman Nath Dhungana told the Post. But political parties often give the post to someone from the party so as to satisfy their aspirations.On May 15, UML chair Oli hinted that as Congress lawmakers had continuously been barring Home Minister Lamichhane from speaking in the House, the situation would be changed. Congress, the main opposition party, has been disrupting the House proceedings, demanding a parliamentary inquiry against Lamichhane in his alleged connections with cooperative funds embezzlement. \"It is unacceptable to us that only the Congress speaks in the meeting. Congress is not the only party in Parliament,” Oli said at the UML parliamentary party meeting on May 15. “Home Minister Lamichhane will speak at the parliament meeting tomorrow; if not, our party will speak.”The next day, Speaker Ghimire allowed Home Minister Lamichhane to go to the rostrum and make his statement while Congress lawmakers were already chanting slogans. Then the situation turned tense and resulted in a scuffle.Though Congress allowed President Ramchandra Paudel to present the government’s policies and programmes on May 14, it obstructed the motion to thank the head of state for the task, as per the parliamentary tradition.After the May 16 incident, Congress General Secretary Gagan Thapa criticised Speaker Ghimire for his role in Parliament. “Why did the Speaker take the House proceedings ahead forcefully when the main opposition was protesting?” Thapa said. “Whatever happened in the House is unfortunate, and the Speaker should bear the responsibility.” However, former Speaker Taranath Ranabhat, also a former general secretary of the Congress, does not agree with Thapa. Speakers should not be held squarely responsible for their role in Parliament, said Ranabhat.“Parliamentarians represent their parties, but the Speaker's role is like a referee,” Ranabhat told the Post. “When trying to bring everyone together, sometimes the Speaker might try to favour some parties to win their confidence which might be uncomfortable for others. However, the Speaker's role should not be questioned on that basis alone.”Earlier, the roles played by former Speakers Agni Prasad Sapkota and Krishna Bahadur Mahara—both from the Maoist Centre—became controversial too. Then-finance minister Janardan Sharma, a Maoist Centre leader, tabled the substitution bill related to budget ordinances in Parliament in September 2021, amid protests of the main opposition UML. Speaker Sapkota had allowed Sharma to table the bill amid obstruction from the UML.The UML also accused Speaker Sapkota of aiding the party’s split. The UML at the time had urged the Speaker to sack 14 UML lawmakers, who defected to form the CPN (Unified Socialist) under Madhav Kumar Nepal. However, the Speaker refused to formalise the UML’s decision. The UML persistently protested in Parliament demanding Sapkota’s resignation as Speaker.In January 2019, Speaker Mahara was accused of siding with the ruling party during the passage of the National Medical Education Bill, even though the Congress had contested some of the bill's clauses. Additionally, he came under fire for not allowing Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba to voice his opinion in the House before inviting then-prime minister Oli to speak on the contentious Guthi Bill. Ramchandra Paudel, a former Congress leader who became the Speaker after the 1996 midterm election, even faced impeachment for his role in Parliament. An impeachment motion was registered against him on September 23, 1998, for aiding the passage of a bill amid obstructions from the main opposition UML.In principle, the Speaker shouldn’t carry forward the House business even if a single parliamentarian raises his hand, says Hari Bahadur Thapa, a senior journalist who has followed Parliament for more than two decades.The Speaker has the right to marshal security personnel against a parliamentarian if they disrupt the House proceedings, but s/he cannot carry forward the House business when there is an obstruction, Thapa told the Post. \nThe current key financial indicators in Nepal are highly paradoxical and worrisome. According to the latest data released by the Nepal Rastra Bank, the central bank of Nepal, deposits in banks and financial institutions (BFIs) have crossed the Rs6.16 trillion mark, while credit disbursement is Rs5.12 trillion. These two figures are 108 and 92 percent of Nepal's estimated Rs5.7 trillion gross domestic product (GDP), respectively. This means that even after maintaining mandatory cash ratios with the central bank—which amounts to around Rs3.6 trillion in aggregate—about Rs6.5 trillion is available as loanable liquidity in the banking system. This, indeed, should have been a god-sent historical opportunity to catapult Nepal to the next level of economic activities and growth. Sadly, that does not seem to be on the anvil.Now, the loan uptake by the entrepreneurs and investors is very slow. The credit growth is 2 percent slower than the deposit growth. The effective interest rate is still in double digits, hovering between 10 to 12 percent. For small borrowers who generally rely on microfinance institutions and credit cooperatives, the cost of funds is at least 20 percent. High interest rate is apparently one of the key deterrents to potential borrowers. Also, a higher amount of deposit collection compared to loan disbursement is taking a toll on the profitability of the BFIs.On one hand, despite most BFIs’ favourable loanable liquidity position, they are unwilling to cut the interest rate for fear of a further decline in profitability. Such practices blatantly compromise the principle of price determination in a free and complete market based on the quantity of funds demanded and supplied. On the other hand, non-performing loans (NPL) of the BFIs are rapidly growing. The total NPL was 3.6 percent of the total loan disbursement last January, which has now risen to 4.8 percent. In nominal terms, approximately Rs250 billion worth of loans is slipping into the risky zone. As its obvious aftermath, the number of borrowers blacklisted for their default on timely repayment is reported to be about 200 per day. This inescapable trap to businesses is created due to the growing number of business closures and increasing financial losses in those businesses struggling to survive. Economy in recessionTechnically, a recession is defined as a decline in GDP growth for two consecutive quarters. However, to the great relief of the ruling political leaders and bureaucracy, Nepal does not produce quarterly GDP growth data. If the annual growth forecasts like the recent ones from the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank, which predicted Nepal's growth rate to be no more than 4 percent in 2024, are to be trusted, Nepal is clearly in a recessionary trajectory. Other disappointing trends in real income, industrial output, employment rate, wholesale and retail sales and overall service sector performance confirm that the economy went downhill in several successive quarters to arrive at this stage.Other rather subjective but evident recession traits are manifested in the form of pervasive plummeting of the consumers' confidence, investors' confidence, overall market confidence, and trust deficit on the incumbent government's sincerity as the principal agent supposed to work for the economic betterment of the country.The gapsThe economic revival looks challenging even in several years if the government fails to take bold countercyclical measures, mainly in revenue collection, capital expenditure and implementing fiscal federalism. And the monetary policy must improve corporate governance in the banking sector, which private sector players dominate by more than 90 percent. This is exactly where effective coordination between fiscal and monetary policies is indispensable.On the fiscal policy side, if the tax policy to find new revenue sources is not comprehensively recalibrated, the collected revenue, like in recent years, will continue to fall short of even meeting the current expenditures, let alone augmenting the capital expenditure and saving the country from default on sovereign debt servicing. The capital allocation in the federal budget is pathetic, persistently at less than 20 percent of total earmarks. Worse, the spending capacity has effectively come down to about 40 percent of even such a low allocation.Despite federalism devolving the constitutional authority to sub-national levels to devise 'their own' public procurement laws, timely completion of contractual procedures of the projects has been extremely tardy. The complications are added by the vested interests of the people in executive power in awarding contracts with apparent conflict of interest. When the government, as the single largest procurer, fails to spend its capital budget transparently, the cash flow in the financial market is bound to shrink. This has direct ramifications on the liquidity positions of the BFIs. The persistent failure of the governments at all three tiers to carry out the capital expenditure as outlined has a cumulative adverse impact.Trust the systemA sincere effort to put fiscal federalism into practice in the true spirit of the federal polity and state architecture will certainly solve several critical issues related to fiscal resource management at the provincial or municipal levels. For instance, reasonably effective management of the bond market at the centre helps generate resources for development expenditure. In allocation, the disbursement may be proportionate to the absorption capacity of an individual administrative unit like a ministry or a federal unit like a municipality. This would ameliorate a number of pending constraints faced by the entire financial system of the country. It is already too late to consider the legislation to empower competent municipalities to issue their own development bonds so as to enhance the fiscal policy independence of the local governments and increase the stakeholder ownership of the executed projects.To conclude, two critical steps are inevitable to rescue the economy from the brink of a deeper recession. One, a stimulus package with an amalgam of fiscal and monetary incentives is necessary. The business-as-usual budget will not solve new challenges to the economy, like the rapidly depleting base of state income. Two, the impending credit risk in BFIs will be far larger if the businesses are not put back on track by enabling them to unlock their full potential, now an existential threat due to the engulfing recession. \nSunday marked the seventh year of the signing of the Belt and Road Initiative between Nepal and China yet the two sides are still struggling to finalise the implementation plan of the BRI that China proposed in early 2020.Nepal and China signed a memorandum of understanding on the One Belt One Road, later known as BRI, a flagship initiative of Chinese President Xi Jinping, on May 12, 2017, subject to renewal every three years.Still, there is a divergence of views on whether Nepal needs a dedicated BRI implementation plan to execute the projects under the Chinese initiative, senior government leaders and officials told the Post. Hence there is no clarity over when and how the implementation plan will be signed.The draft titled “Implementation Plan on Jointly Building the Belt and Road Initiative between the Government of the People’s Republic of China and the Government of Nepal” is currently under the purview of the National Planning Commission for its redrafting/processing.There was a general understanding between Nepal and China to sign the BRI implementation plan during the China visit of Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal in September last year as well as during the visit of Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs, Narayan Kaji Shrestha, in March this year. But there was little progress on both the visits and the signing was indefinitely postponed.The draft of the BRI implementation plan is not ready yet, DPM Shrestha said. It is said to be in the final stage of completion. Shrestha says he tried to push the plan in his interactions with the Chinese side but there has been no progress.One senior government official told the Post that the elections in India are the primary reason the plan has not made headway in China.No sensitive decision that may hurt relations with India and China will be taken around election time, said an official at the prime minister’s office who is privy to the issue.Shrestha said that projects under the BRI will be selected only after the plan’s signing.“It is our position that we will select a new set of projects only after signing the BRI implementation plan,” Shrestha told the Post.Asked about the nine projects selected during the tenure of KP Sharma Oli as the prime minister in 2019-20, Shrestha said they now have only referential value.The text of the BRI implementation plan, which Nepal first received in early 2020 after Chinese President Xi Jinping’s Nepal visit, is a comprehensive document that outlines nine clusters: economic cooperation, agriculture, education, connectivity, trade, investment, tourism, culture, and people-to-people cooperation.It said that the two sides would identify projects, discuss the investment modality and the way to execute it. After several rounds of exchanging text and comments, the Chinese side in October 2021 sent their draft to the Sher Bahadur Deuba government.After Deuba became the prime minister, China’s State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi came to Nepal on an official visit. He then shared that Beijing has reservations over the financing modality of the projects to be undertaken under the BRI; Nepal had made it clear that it cannot afford loans with over 1 percent interest to implement the projects, and the country prioritised grants and concessional loans.“The country’s economic situation has not improved. We are not in a position to take loans from anywhere including China as they would increase pressure on the weak Nepali economy,” said an official at the Prime Minister’s Office.Amid the delays, China last year started the “Silkroad Roadster” in Nepal, focusing on some small-scale projects.Nepal gave continuity to its old position when Prime Minister Dahal visited China in September-October last year.“When the issue of BRI was discussed in Beijing during the prime minister’s trip, we told the Chinese authorities that we will sign the implementation plan at an ‘appropriate’ time,” former foreign minister NP Saud, a Nepali Congress leader, said. “We also conveyed to the Chinese officials and leaders that our preference is grant, not loan.”The Congress and other political parties have called for a national consensus on vital issues like the BRI or any other development or economic vehicle with far-reaching consequences for the country. Apart from the investment modality, Nepal also has reservations over a clause of the BRI implementation plan dealing with security concerns.A former minister familiar with the plan expresses reservations over the text handed over by the Chinese, which Nepal wants to amend before signing or avoid. The document’s sub-section 12 titled ‘Other Areas’ under section 3 named ‘Cooperation Priorities’ mentions that “the two sides will strengthen legal cooperation and actively carry out diverse legal exchanges and capacity building in order to facilitate B&R [belt and road] cooperation”.It also says “the two sides will implement relevant agreements on law enforcement cooperation and strengthen security cooperation through joint training, information exchange, and capacity building, including for disaster management”.Beijing accords the BRI top foreign policy priority. In every high-level visit and meeting between Nepal and China, the initiative gets traction.Although there is no clear provision on whether the two sides should renew the agreement by exchanging correspondence, officials at the finance ministry said that would be the diplomatically correct way to go about it.There are concerns over the BRI’s stalled momentum in Nepal. The initiative’s stated focus is connectivity, trade, development strategies, and policy dialogues for cooperation in the fields of economy, environment, technology and culture.The agreement also aims to facilitate transit transport, logistics, transport network security and related infrastructure development through joint study and promote cross-border projects including railway, road, civil aviation, power grid, information and communication. The MoU also states that the two sides would conclude the joint feasibility study of China-Nepal Free Trade Agreement shortly and, if viable, start negotiations on a Free Trade Agreement to open up more markets and expand bilateral trade.Other stated areas of agreed cooperation are establishing cross-border economic cooperation zones at the existing ports, and improving the investment landscape with a view to developing mega projects in the areas of power generation, water conservation, road, railway line, cross-border transmission line, information and communication technology and infrastructure, besides customs and quarantine.Nepal also had a shaky position on the BRI in the past. After signing the deal in 2017, the government formed two committees headed by the foreign and finance secretaries to negotiate with China on the projects selected under the initiative. The finance secretary was tasked with project selection.As per the Cabinet’s mandate, the finance secretary-led committee picked 35 projects to be funded under the BRI. Then-prime minister KP Sharma Oli read out this list during his meeting with Chinese counterpart Li Keqiang. Later, the Chinese side urged Kathmandu to cut the number of projects to a single digit, whereupon the list was pared down to nine projects.A former finance ministry official who was involved in several negotiations with the Chinese side said most of the nine projects were related to connectivity and infrastructure. In 2019, during the second BRI Conference in China, its outcome document listed Trans-Himalayan Multi-Dimensional Connectivity Network under the BRI. (Former President Bidya Devi Bhandari had attended the conference.) Then, when Chinese President Xi visited Kathmandu in October 2019, the two sides agreed to enhance cooperation under the BRI.They agreed “to intensify implementation of the Memorandum of Understanding on Cooperation under the Belt and Road Initiative to enhance connectivity, encompassing such vital components as ports, roads, railways, aviation and communications within the overarching framework of the Trans-Himalayan Multi-Dimensional Connectivity Network with a view to significantly contributing to Nepal’s development agenda of graduating from a Least Developed Country,” according to a joint statement issued after Xi’s visit to Kathmandu.The Chinese side was keen to carry out the feasibility study of Kerung-Kathmandu railway under the BRI, the former finance ministry official said. “But we have shifting priorities on selecting and negotiating other projects.”The feasibility study of the Kerung-Kathmandu railway has already begun with a Chinese grant and it is expected to conclude by 2026 June, said Rohit Kumar Bisural, director general at Department of Railways.“As per our agreement, the feasibility study of the cross border railway should be completed by 2026 June. There are various studies on the ground. Nepali engineers and technical staff are not directly involved but they are supporting the Chinese technicians as required. There are no glitches. Once the study is complete, we will jointly write a report,” said Bisural.A joint secretary at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs told the Post that no tangible progress has been made in the past seven years in implementing the BRI plan and no agreement is likely anytime soon either.“This calls for consensus among the political parties as it is not just a matter of the government or one party,” said the joint-secretary. “The BRI is unlikely to move forward in Nepal anytime soon because there is no discussion, consultation and consensus among the major parties.”Mahendra Bahadur Pandey, former foreign minister and Nepal’s ex-ambassador to China, said many leaders and officials have blamed high-interest loans for not taking the BRI forward but that is not the reason.“We do not complete projects on time. If we did, we could easily pay back the loan and interest to China and other lending countries. Our leaders also fear the reaction of other countries [to accepting any kind of Chinese help],” said Pandey.“We have ‘fear psychosis’ while taking economic support,” he said. “Nepalis are scared that India, China or the United States will be angry if the country takes support from any one of them.” “We have to accept foreign support by taking neighbours and major powers into confidence,” Pandey said. \nEducation in Every Home’s report titled ‘Diversity, Equity and Inclusion in Nepal’s Textbooks’ highlights the lack of diversity, inclusivity, and inaccuracies in these textbooks.  The findings include egregious mistakes in textbooks like the inclusion of a letter Abraham Lincloln supposedly wrote—dating to a time 17 years after his assassination, to assertions like Brazil has tigers, elephants and rhinos while Germany has tigers and monkeys. The books display a clear bias in favour of Brahmin Chhetri males, while women make up just 18 percent of all people profiled. While 80 percent of all bylines are male, the presence of marginalised communities, especially Dalits, is nearly non-existent.  \n**Summarization:**\n\n[Subject or Event] underwent [Key Action(s)] leading to [Consequence or Outcome] in [Timeframe].\nLed by a Mandarin speaker with a Chinese politics master's degree, the Araniko Project explores Nepal-China relations through Mandarin primary sources.\nNepali institutions organized \"Project Sambad,\" a platform for critical discussions on Nepali society and policy-making, with its first event in Kathmandu on March 14-15.\nSince 2017, Upendra Yadav's Janata Samajbadi Party-Nepal has consistently led the Madhesh provincial government, yet experts criticize its governance, accusing it of failing to promote federalism and other crucial reforms.\nKP Sharma Oli criticized Finance Minister Barsha Man Pun's budget for not aligning with the socialist principles of the constitution and instructed lawmakers to scrutinize it, highlighting concerns about a lack of consultations among ruling coalition partners.\nParliament formed a 7-member committee to investigate misuse of public funds by cooperatives after overcoming numerous obstacles and discussions, but the investigation's commencement remains uncertain despite establishing terms of reference.\nThe current political equation is experiencing turbulence from the provincial to central level, and managing dissatisfaction within ruling parties has become a Herculean task for Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal and KP Sharma Oli, the UML chair and key architect of the ruling coalition.After Madhav Kumar Nepal, the chair of the coalition member CPN (Unified Socialist), joined a meeting of opposition parties on Wednesday called by the main opposition Nepali Congress chief Sher Bahadur Deuba, it sent shockwaves through the ruling coalition. This prompted Dahal and Oli to meet Nepal on Friday to discuss the matter.On Thursday, Prime Minister Dahal called on Jhala Nath Khanal, another senior leader of Unified Socialist, and discussed the possibility of the Nepal faction lending support to the main opposition in pursuit of a more advantageous deal.But, according to Khanal, he assured the prime minister that his party would remain within the present ruling alliance and had no intention of quitting the government. The Unified Socialist has two ministers in the federal Cabinet and the party played a crucial role in forming governments in Sudurpaschim and Koshi provinces as well now both Dahal and Oli are looking for similar kinds of support from the party to form a new government in the Madhesh province.But Nepal’s party has its own grievances. “The UML is not cooperating with our chief minister in Sudurpaschim,” said Jagannath Khatiwada, spokesperson of the Unified Socialist. “And, they have not bothered to ask us for our ministerial nominees for the new Koshi Cabinet.” Dirgha Sodari of Unified Socialist is the chief minister of Sudurpaschim, but the UML has not provided him its list of ministerial candidates. While in the Koshi province, Chief Minister Hikmat Karki has not reached out to the UML for the Unified Socialist for ministerial nominations, according to party sources.On Wednesday, opposition parties sought support from Nepal to ensure the continuity of the sitting chief minister Saroj Yadav of the Janata Samajbadi Party in Madhesh Province. “Both Dahal and Oli feared that we might extend support to Yadav,” Khatiwada said.Khatiwada expressed dissatisfaction with the ruling coalition saying, “Although we are in the federal coalition, we are not consulted before taking any decision.”During a meeting of the party’s parliamentary committee on Friday, the prime minister claimed that Nepal had consulted him before attending the meeting with opposition parties.“Nepalji is very much with us, and there is no chance of any change in the coalition,” Dahal said at the meeting. However, UML has taken serious objection to Nepal’s participation in the meeting of the opposition parties. The UML’s concern seems valid as Nepal in recent weeks has been publicly airing his dissatisfaction against the government and the coalition over “continued neglect” of his party by the ruling coalition leaders.According to a leader of the Maoist Centre, Oli expressed his reservations over Nepal’s participation in the meeting of the opposition parties. “It does not look good,” Oli said to Nepal during their meeting on Friday, according to a UML source. “While you are part of the government, you are also participating in opposition party meetings. This is objectionable.”Opposition parties are waiting for the Supreme Court’s verdict regarding the split of Upendra Yadav’s Janata Samajbadi Party Nepal. The party was part of the government, but after the division, a faction led by Ashok Rai is the government and the other faction led by Upendra Yadav is not. Yadav challenged the legality of the split in the court. During the Maoist Centre’s parliamentary party meeting on Friday, Nepal’s participation in the opposition parties' meeting was one of the topics of discussion, and some lawmakers wanted to hear from the prime minister about Nepal's potential move, according to a Maoist Centre leader. “Nepalji had informed me before participating in the meeting of the opposition parties. Do not have doubts about the stability of the government, it is very much intact. He did not attend the meeting to join the opposition alliance,” Dahal said in the party’s meeting, although his remarks raised concerns about the future of the current ruling alliance. Recently, the prime minister secured a vote of confidence with comfortable support. Despite this, he felt the need to reassure his party leaders that the government remains stable and no one is going to unseat him anytime soon. Barely hours after making this claim, Dahal, joined by Oli held a meeting with Nepal at the prime minister’s office and sought his assurance in forming a new government in the Madhesh province.But the Unified Socialist has yet to take a formal decision on whether to support the opposition’s candidate, current chief minister Yadav, or the federal coalition’s candidate from CK Raut’s Janamat Party. Raut’s party is eying the post with support from CPN-UML and the Maoist Centre.“It’s all about give-and-take and bargaining,” said Khatiwada, adding, “If we get credible assurances from the prime minister and Oli that they will provide full support and cooperation at both the centre and provinces, then we will support the process of forming the new government in Madhesh province.” \nA standoff between Road Division, Kathmandu, and Kathmandu Metropolitan City at New Road ended without any untoward incident on Monday after the federal government deployed a massive police force.The city police, deployed in huge numbers to stop the division’s workers from repairing the road section between New Road gate and Juddha Salik destroyed by the metropolis, were backed off after federal police intervened.“We are committed to executing an order of the metropolis to expand pedestrian lanes in the New Road area,” said Raju Nath Pandey, chief of City Police. “We backed off, as we cannot scuffle with the federal police force. Everybody knows who deployed the federal police and what their intention is. There are hundreds of places in Kathmandu where road conditions are not good, but the Road Division has hurried to fix the parts we cut for expansion of the sidewalks.”The dispute between the two agencies—Road Division and Kathmandu metropolis—over expanding pedestrian lanes and not letting cutting road sections spiraled into Monday’s standoff.Some ten days ago, the metropolis cut 1.5 metres on both sides of roads in New Road to expand footpaths.The division intervened and stopped the metropolis workers from cutting the roads, saying that the road section comes under its jurisdiction and that the city office has not taken approval for the footpath expansion.Mayor Balendra Shah then directed officials to dump truckloads of dirt and trash in front of the main entrance of the Road Division office, blaming the agencies for delayed road expansion work from Kalanki to Maharajgunj which had caused problems for the public.Taking to social media, Kathmandu Mayor Shah blamed Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Physical Infrastructure and Transport Raghubir Mahaseth for not expediting the road expansion.“If your direct order can stop an ongoing project, it can also complete the work,” Shah said.“For the past 15 years, the citizens of Kathmandu have had to breathe in dusty air and face hardships in the name of Ring Road expansion,” reads Shah’s status posted on social media.Mayor Shah also sarcastically warned that the KMC would send a truckload of dust as a gift to Minister Mahaseth every day until the work along the Ring Road section is expedited.“It does not look good for only the public to suffer. I will continue to send a truckload of dust to you as a ‘gift’ every day until the work is resumed. Please accept it as love,” Shah wrote.The 8.2km Kalanki-Maharajgunj section was to be widened by the Chinese government, and the work was initially planned to start in early 2020, but the project has not progressed even after years.The Road Division, which picked up the dust and garbage dumped by the metropolis on its own, criticised the metropolis for its act.“The behaviour of the largest and responsible local government of the country mocks the rule of law, and this kind of behaviour in a violent and chaotic manner will never enhance the dignity of the metropolis,” reads the statement issued by the division.The division later issued an ultimatum to the KMC, asking it to fix the damaged parts of the roads within two days.When the metropolis ignored the ultimatum, the division itself repaired the damaged parts taking the help of federal police forces.“The metropolis dug up the roads without taking approval from our office. Instead of seeking approval, it gave us notice about its decision,” said Pramod Khatiwada, information officer at the division. “As the monsoon is about to start and the New Road area is one of the busiest road sections, it was our responsibility to repair it.”When asked if metropolis officials are committed to expanding the pavements, Khatiwada said that he hoped concerned officials would “come to their senses” and sort out the disputes, obtaining approval from concerned agencies.“They should first hold discussions with officials and higher agencies and convince them why they need to expand the footpath and take over the road section from us,” said Khatiwada. “We hope that the city office will not repeat the same mistake again and again.”Metropolis officials said that footpaths in new road areas, which always remain busy and packed, should be widened enough so that pedestrians can move freely. Officials claimed that locals from the New Road area have also requested the city office for the expansion.“Locals have also complained about insecurity and sexual harassment in walking on the footpath,” said Sunita Maharjan, elected ward member of Ward 24 of the metropolis. “Locals from our ward have no objection to the expansion of the footpath. The metropolis has started expansion works in demand of the public.”Sobha Malakar, a local from the Indrachowk area, said that it is very difficult to walk on the narrow pavement in the New Road area. Most of the locals of Ward 24 demanded the expansion of the footpaths with the city office. “It is very difficult to walk freely on the footpath in the New Road area,” said Malakar. “Walking on the footpath is very suffocating in the area. Women and girls walk on the road risking collision with vehicles.”Some people supported the Road Division's moves to prevent the city office from expanding the footpath on Monday. Locals of Ward 24 said that those not seeking pavement expansion are from other wards who fear that the already narrowed roads in their area would be further narrowed.“Those who had protested for parking in New Road have been protesting against the expansion of the footpath,” reads Mayor Shah’s status posted on social media.He asked the public to consider how the road will be narrowed for driving when a sidewalk is made only of parts that were used for parking in the past. \nThe Commission for the Investigation of Abuse of Authority on Monday filed a graft case at the Special Court against 14 individuals, including Gajendra Maharjan, the mayor of Godawari Municipality in Lalitpur.The case has been filed against them, charging them with causing a revenue loss of Rs1.04 billion to the state coffers while approving tenders for the extraction of sand and stones from the fiscal year 2018-19 to 2022-23.The CIAA has named Maharjan, the then administrative officer, along with other people’s representatives and contractors, as defendants in the case. Information Officer at the Special Court, Yagya Raj Regmi, said the CIAA had filed the case on the charge of causing revenue loss by awarding contracts at rates lower than those fixed by the government.Maharjan, who was elected mayor from the Nepali Congress, is serving his second term as the municipal chief. \nMany countries worldwide have started using smart systems, including artificial intelligence, to manage chaotic traffic. Nepal, however, has chosen to deploy traffic rule violators as traffic rule keepers.What concerns legal experts, former law enforcement officials, and the chair of the State Affairs and Good Governance Committee of House of Representatives is the individual whim and fantasy of Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Home Affairs Ravi Lamichhane, who issued a direction under agencies concerned under his ministry to enforce the decision to deploy rule violators on the road for traffic management.“Stop ruling people at an individual whim. This is neither Rana nor Shah regime or military rule,” said Ramhari Khatiwada, chairman of the State Affairs and Good Governance Committee of the House. “Home minister should stop humiliating people, and he too is not above the law.”Khatiwada said that he had sought time with Home Minister Lamichhane to discuss the issue on Friday but he did not give him time. He said that the government should formulate a law first and bring regulations if it thinks deploying rule violators for traffic management is necessary.The Metropolitan Traffic Police Division of Kathmandu said that it had deployed 1,302 people who were booked for traffic rules violations, including drunk driving, on Wednesday.“We are only implementing the instructions of the higher agency,” said Jeevan Kumar Shrestha, the division’s spokesperson. “We provided basic instructions to the rule violators and deployed them on streets for traffic management.”When asked if rules violators would help traffic police manage Kathmandu’s traffic, Shrestha said that even the traffic police, who received one to one-and-a-half years of training, sometimes could not handle the traffic chaos.Former senior officials at Nepal Police also questioned the intention of the home minister to force traffic rule violators to stay on the roads. They say that existing law doesn't support the home minister’s decision, and it also jeopardises the safety of those being deployed on the streets.“The decision to deploy rule violators is against the will of the people, which is against the provision that the state will not force anyone to serve against their will,” said Hemanta Malla, former deputy inspector general of Nepal Police. “This decision can be challenged in court.”Managing traffic is an expert’s job. Traffic police, who have worked for years in Valley's traffic management, also sometimes find the job challenging. Legal experts said that the home minister should bring law and regulation first if he thinks the valley's traffic would be better managed by forcing rule violators to stay on the roads.“The decision is against the principle of the rule of law. People cannot be forced to follow the home minister’s irrational directions,” said Raju Chapagain, a constitutional lawyer. “Respective committee of the House, National Human Rights Commission and other concerned agencies should take note of this decision and direct the concerned agencies to stop ruling people at individual whims.” \nOver 7,000 children between six and eight years of age are out of school in the Kathmandu district and could miss the inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) in the ongoing immunisation drive, health authorities estimate.Officials said they only have an estimation of the number of children in that age bracket but do not know their whereabouts.“Children in the floating population, of parents working in construction sectors and factories or of those residing in slum settlements, who do not go to school, are the high-risk groups but they could be deprived of the vaccination programme,” said Dr Arjun Sapkota, chief of the Health Office, Kathmandu.“We will run a vaccination programme in health facilities on the last day of the campaign, but we are unsure if all the children missing the vaccine will get inoculated.”The Ministry of Health and Population launched a nationwide immunisation drive on Sunday, targeting over 1.46 million children born between April 2016 and October 2018 who have missed the inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) due to a global shortage. Those children were administered only Type-1 and Type-3 polio oral vaccines and had missed the Type-2 polio vaccine.Officials at the Immunisation Section of the Family Welfare Division under the Department of Health Services estimated that thousands of children throughout the country neither go to school nor participate in health care programmes.“Providing health care services, including routine vaccines, to those populations is the most challenging task,” said Dr Abhiyan Gautam, the section chief. “Chances of those groups missing the services, including the routine vaccines, are always there. We will send health workers to the at-risk areas to find such children.”Healthworkers found over 74,000 children out of school nationwide during the measles-rubella campaign launched in February. “We are aware of the children who are out of school,” said Gautam. “Floating population, scattered slums, working-class people, lack of awareness and poor access to health workers are major challenges to health workers. We will send health workers to the areas designated as risk zones.”Nepal has been polio-free since 2010, but the World Health Organisation officially gave the status on March 27, 2014, after maintaining zero polio cases for three consecutive years.After introducing the IPV vaccine in September 2014, the country switched to the bivalent oral poliovirus vaccine (bOPV0) from the trivalent oral poliovirus vaccine (tOPV). The trivalent oral poliovirus vaccine contains all three types of poliovirus: Type-1, Type-2, and Type-3. The current oral poliovirus vaccine is made up of live, attenuated poliovirus. The trivalent poliovirus vaccine was effective against all three types of poliovirus. However, the Type-2 component of this vaccine can lead to the circulation of vaccine-derived viruses. Its use was linked to a vaccine associated with paralytic polio, a condition in which children develop paralysis.Nepal became the first country in South Asia to incorporate the IPV vaccine in its routine immunisation programme in line with the UN health body’s endgame strategic plan to eliminate the risk of vaccine-derived poliovirus and phase out all oral polio vaccines in the routine immunisation programme.IPV consists of inactivated poliovirus strains of all three poliovirus types.Health officials say that children should continuously receive the bivalent poliovirus vaccine, even if they are administered the IPV vaccine, as the bivalent poliovirus vaccine is also necessary for intestinal immunity, while IPV provides mucosal immunity.The government's number one priority is childhood immunisation, under which 13 types of vaccines are given free of charge against a range of diseases, including measles-rubella, pneumonia, tuberculosis, diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus, hepatitis B, rotavirus, Japanese encephalitis, and typhoid, under the regular immunisation programme.Regular immunisation is one of the most successful programmes in Nepal, with a high coverage rate. The country has demonstrated remarkable progress in reducing the under-five mortality rate and the regular immunisation programme is credited with that.However, the Nepal Demographic and Health Survey-2022, carried out by the Ministry of Health and Population, showed that at least four percent of the children aged between 12 and 23 months received no vaccine at all. This figure was one percent in 2016. The Ministry of Health and Population said that the nationwide vaccine coverage rate for polio is 95 percent. \nVidushi Rana has been appointed the new Honorary Consul of the Republic of Iceland in Nepal. The event also marked the inauguration of the new Consulate premises in Kathmandu. Dignitaries from various sectors graced the welcome event, reflecting the importance of this diplomatic milestone. Gudni Bragason, ambassador of the Republic of Iceland, as a special guest underscored the need to strengthen bilateral relations between Nepal and Iceland. Rana expressed her gratitude and commitment to fostering stronger relations between Nepal and Iceland. She highlighted the mutual benefits of enhanced diplomatic and economic ties and looked forward to her role in promoting cultural and commercial exchanges between the two nations.  \nThe Central Dairy Cooperatives Association has issued an ultimatum to the government, stating that it would launch a protest if dairy farmers are not paid their outstanding dues by dairy companies within the next two weeks.Amar Bahadur Kunwar, president of the association, said that despite an agreement signed between the government and dairy cooperatives to settle the farmers' dues, the cooperatives, especially those associated with private dairy companies, have breached the agreement, causing the problem.Private and state-owned dairies owe around Rs5 billion to farmers, said Kunwar.On March 4, three private dairy associations—Central Dairy Cooperatives Association, Nepal Dairy Association, and Dairy Industry Association—the state-owned Dairy Development Corporation, and the Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock Development, had signed a trilateral agreement to pay farmers their dues.There, however, were no single representatives of the farmers during the signing of the agreement.Under the agreement, farmers who have not received payments since August last year were to receive a payment for six months or until mid-January by April 3. “The agreement was a lie,” said Kunwar.\"We have on Monday, notified in advance to the Dairy Development Board, Dairy Development Corporation, Nepal Dairy Association, Nepal Dairy Industry Association, Agriculture Ministry, Prime Minister’s Office and Finance Ministry about our protest plan and its consequences,” said Kunwar. “We have given a 15-day ultimatum to clear the payment, or else we will launch a stern protest.”Surya Prasad Paudel, general manager of the Dairy Development Corporation, said, “We borrowed Rs300 million in credit from the government and cleared the farmers due till December last year. We still owe more than Rs1 billion to dairy farmers since January.”In February, the corporation sought a bailout fund amounting to Rs300 million from the Finance Ministry. Subsequently, in March, the government decided to provide the credit.The corporation said the stock of butter and powdered milk has piled up due to low demand in the market, and as a result, the cash flow has stopped. Despite the summer heat, the demand for dairy products has not improved. The corporation has also issued a tender for the sale of butter and powdered milk. “Let's see how much we can sell,” Paudel said.Despite the summer season, the demand for dairy products has not fully picked up. “The low demand will not help us generate the income needed to pay the farmers,” Paudel said.Market insiders say that the Dahal-led government, without conducting proper studies, hiked the price of milk for two consecutive years to encourage farmers to produce milk. They said the consumer price of dairy products has become too high, as people's incomes have not improved, resulting in a slowdown in sales.On March 3 last year, the government hiked the minimum purchase price of raw milk paid to farmers by Rs9.1 per litre to Rs65.5. Later in the same month, the DDC increased the price of half-litre of standard milk that comes in a blue packet by Rs5.50 to Rs48.50.Demand for dairy products started falling as soon as the prices were hiked. “People's incomes have dropped. They cannot afford to buy a litre of milk that costs over Rs100. The curd price has jumped to Rs200 per litre, and the prices of other dairy products have also increased,\" said Madhav Timalsina, president of the Consumer Investigation Forum. “An unfair price on dairy products benefits neither consumers nor farmers.”Both state-owned and private dairies have been saying that the ongoing economic slowdown has dampened dairy demand, resulting in stopped cash flow and rising liabilities to farmers as products remained unsold for months.The corporation is yet to finalise the strategies regarding clearing the remaining dues, Paudel said.Kunwar of the Central Dairy Cooperative Association said that the association does not make the payment, but it facilitates settling the payment from the dairy industry and other problems. The association does not know why the dairy industry is not able to settle the payment as per the agreement.According to Peasants' Coalition Nepal, the association of dairy farmers, farmers in eastern Tarai are facing even greater hardships as it has been nearly a year since they received any payments. The farmers of Jhapa and Biratnagar [Morang] have not received their payments for months. The farmers of Chitwan are also struggling. \nThe United States Agency for International Development (USAID) Nepal brought together 100 Nepali business leaders at the Kathmandu Marriott Hotel on Friday to celebrate Menstrual Hygiene Day.The event celebrated the commitment by Nepal’s industrial and private sector leaders, emphasising the impact of creating menstruation-friendly workplaces, the organiser said in a statement.During the event, dignified workplace advisory board members and directors of the Annapurna Media Network Sachan J Thapa and Subha Khanal pledged Rs1 million worth of media spotlight to the dignified workplace programme in Nepal.Likewise, the Executive Director of Jasmine Hygiene Punit Sarda pledged Rs1 million worth of sanitary pads to the programme.Speaking at the event, USAID Nepal Health Office Director Patricia Mengech said USAID is proud of the partnership with the private sector to dignify menstruation across the country and improve the sexual and reproductive health of women workers in Nepal.“This support is part of a long-standing partnership, dating back over 70 years, between the US government and Nepal to improve the health care and wellbeing of Nepalis,” she said.Dignified workplace advisory board member Gaurav Agarwal, who is Director of Everest Hospitality and Chairman of the Shikhar Insurance Board, reiterated that he believes that a dignified workplace where women are respected and taken care of, including their menstrual hygiene needs, is a human right. \nA powerful storm on Friday and Saturday destroyed most of the banana crop in eastern Chitwan, the banana association said, claiming it was the worst loss the growers had ever faced.The Chitwan Banana Producers Association has estimated that the damage could reach around Rs120 million. With vast stretches of banana farms destroyed, producers warn of imminent shortages of bananas. Ashika Malla of Tulsipur, Chitwan, who leases land and grows bananas on 11 bigah (7.45 hectares), said his crop would be ready for market in the next few weeks. But his hope shattered.“Now, nobody will buy it. It’s neither matured nor ripened. It’s a big loss.\" Malla has yet to assess the full extent of the damage. Besides crop losses, he would need nearly Rs1 million to clear the fallen banana trees and plant new ones. \"It's a big blow,” said Bishnu Hari Panta, former president of the Chitwan Banana Producers Association. Farmers say there are considerable economic consequences for this sector because only a few banana plants are left standing in the eastern part of Chitwan. It would take about seven months to start production again, and even then, it would not be back to normal.Farmers have suffered loss, and they could face a double whammy. For the last one and a half years, most have not received insurance payouts.\"We are not sure of getting the insurance payout anytime soon,\" said Panta. \"Farmers are in big distress,\" he said, adding that the government should immediately release the insurance payout. In Chitwan, banana plantation covers 3,500 bigha (2,370 hectares). Most of the plantations are in the eastern part of Chitwan. \"The eastern part of Chiwan suffered a big loss. The loss in the western part, however, is nominal,\" said Janak Raj Pant, general secretary of the association.Experts say that climate change is making storms more intense and devastating.Apart from droughts and floods, storms and hailstorms are also increasing in Nepal and are considered a major climate-related disaster.According to the National Climate Change Survey 2022, the second of its kind, released by the National Statistics Office recently, the economic losses in both farm and off-farm sectors in the last five years, as reported by households, excluding significant infrastructure damages, amounted to Rs415.44 billion.The survey report said that drought had been reported as the major disaster, affecting 65.4 percent of households, followed by diseases and insects at 54.3 percent, storms at 46.2 percent, hailstorms at 32.6 percent, floods at 28.5 percent, cold waves at 21.7 percent, landslides at 21.5 percent, and inundation at 17.5 percent.Farmers in Chitwan lament the government’s policy on insurance. Since March 14, non-life insurance companies have stopped settling claims for insured farm products after failing to receive government premium subsidies.The government is yet to clear around Rs3 billion under this heading to non-life insurance companies.“The non-payment issue in the agriculture sector has put us in difficulties. Since companies have totally stopped farm insurance, it will erode the confidence of the farmers towards insurance,” Pujan Adhikary, director of the insurance development and promotion division of the Nepal Insurance Authority, recently told a meeting.“Smallholder farmers and rural communities cannot manage climate risks by themselves without adequate financial instruments.”Crop insurance was introduced in Nepal with much fanfare. The government has been formulating directives to implement crop and livestock insurance since January 2013.Under the scheme, the government provided a 50 percent subsidy on the premium in the first year and raised it to 75 percent in the second year.The premium subsidy was again reduced to 50 percent and raised to 80 percent in 2021.When the insurance scheme started ten years ago, there were 802 claims. In the last fiscal year, the annual claims reached 36,000. The Ministry for Agriculture and Livestock Development said that the insurance scheme resumed on May 30 following a meeting chaired by Agriculture Minister Jwala Kumari Sah. In a statement, the ministry said it would immediately release Rs970 million to the insurance companies, and the remaining dues will be settled within this fiscal year or by mid-July.“The insurance companies have agreed to resume the scheme,” the ministry said in a statement. \nThe 16th five-year periodic plan, proposed by the National Planning Commission, aims to reduce neonatal deaths to 13 from the existing 21 in every 1,000 live births. Public health experts, however, are sceptical of its success, as neonatal deaths have not declined since 2016, and the measures taken at present are not sufficient to lessen the ongoing death rates.“Both the Nepal Demographic and Health Survey-2022 and the finance ministry’s recent report show neonatal deaths constantly high,” said Dr Shyam Raj Upreti, former director general at the Department of Health Services. “It will not be easy to pick high-hanging fruits. It requires a lot of investments and micro planning, which are currently lacking.”A recent report by the Ministry of Finance shows that 21 neonates die in every 1,000 live births, the same results shown by the Nepal Demographic and Health Survey-2022, carried out by the Ministry of Health and Population.The government’s target for Sustainable Development Goals is to reduce neonatal mortality to 12 deaths per every 1,000 live births by 2030.The SDGs, a follow-up on the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), aim to end poverty, hunger, and all forms of inequality in the world by 2030. Nepal has committed to meeting the goals.The 16th five-year plan, which starts next fiscal year and ends in 2029, is aligned with the SDG targets.Public health experts say meeting the goal is easier said than done. Most health facilities having birthing centres lack neonatal units, trained human resources, and quality services.“Without ensuring quality services, which require trained human resources and advanced facilities, among others, it is impossible to reduce neonatal deaths,” said Upreti. “The government has made various plans to reduce child deaths—including neonatal deaths—but does not pay much attention to their effective implementation.”The finance ministry’s recent report shows that the institutional delivery rate increased to 80 percent from 79 percent last year. The rise in institutional deliveries has contributed to lessening the maternal mortality rate, which is 151 in every 100,000 live births.“Fifty percent of the neonates die in the first 24 hours of birth,” said Dr Abhiyan Gautam, chief of the Immunisation Section at the Family Welfare Division of the Department of Health Services. “Most of our health facilities, including birthing centres, lack proper infrastructures.”Study shows that 85 percent of all deaths among children under the age of five in Nepal take place before a child’s first birthday, with 64 percent occurring during the first month of life.Along with trained human resources, infrastructures and quality services, deaths of neonates are also linked to the antenatal care visit of pregnant women, access to health facilities, timely referral system and others, experts say. The government has been taking various measures to reduce neonatal deaths, including planning to set up a ‘special newborn care unit’ in all district hospitals throughout the country. For that, concerned agencies under the health ministry have imparted training to all doctors, nurses and paramedics serving in Nuwakot, Dhading, Sindhupalchok and Makawanpur district hospitals.Special newborn care units are general units designed to care for newborn children who fall ill shortly after birth. Doctors, nurses, and paramedics monitor ailing children admitted to the unit.The health ministry has installed an underfloor heating system at birthing centres in four mountain districts to curb postpartum and neonatal deaths there.Underfloor heating is a form of central heating that ensures indoor climate control for thermal comfort. It uses an electrical heating cable installed underneath the flooring.Hypothermia, infection, low birth weight, premature birth, and abnormal birth asphyxia are among the leading causes of neonatal deaths, doctors say.Some of the programmes being undertaken to lower child mortality include newborn care, kangaroo care, exclusive breastfeeding, infection prevention, chlorhexidine for umbilical cord care, and free neonatal care. “Whatever the achievements we made so far were achieved by the measures taken as of now,” said Upreti. “The ongoing programme may not achieve further progress. Government must implement the programmes and plans to prevent more deaths.” \nThe government has allocated Rs86.24 billion to the health sector for the upcoming fiscal year, around a 2.5 percent increase from the 83.99 billion allocated for the current fiscal year.The new allocation is only around 4.6 percent of the total budget.Funds have been allocated to give continuity to most of the ongoing programmes—safe motherhood programmes, free essential medicines, setting up basic health care centres in all wards throughout the country, and financial relief to people from difficult and expensive diseases—cardiovascular disease, cancer, renal failure, Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, head and spinal injury, sickle cell anaemia, and stroke. The health budget also includes grants to Tribhuvan University Teaching Hospital, Nepal Police Hospital, Nepal Army Hospital, Civil Hospital, and others. The national budget has announced a few new programmes, including the establishment of the Sita Dahal Memorial College of Naturopathy and Yogic Science under Kathmandu University. Sita Dahal is the late wife of Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal, who died in July last year. Health experts said that the incumbent government neglected the health sector this year, too, as a slight increase in the annual budget does not help to continue the existing health programme.“How can we achieve the Sustainable Development Goals targets from the budget allocated to the health care sectors?” said Mahendra Prasad Shrestha, former chief specialist at the Ministry of Health and Population. “We need to bring qualitative change, and for that, huge investments are required.”Several healthcare programmes, including safe motherhood programmes, child health programmes, tuberculosis control, nutrition, vector control programmes, epidemic control, non-communicable diseases, and mental health programmes, have already been affected by the cut in the previous year’s budget.Likewise, the budget doesn't address the growing burden of non-communicable diseases.Non-communicable diseases—such as heart disease, stroke, cancer, diabetes, and chronic lung disease—have emerged as major public health problems of late, accounting for 71 percent of deaths in the country.A 2019 study by the Nepal Health Research Council on the prevalence of noncommunicable diseases, which primarily focused on behavioural risk factors—tobacco and alcohol consumption, biological risk factors, raised blood pressure, overweight, obesity, abnormal lipid prevalence, coronary artery disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and diabetes—found non-communicable diseases have emerged as a major killer.Nepal has witnessed several outbreaks in recent years—dengue, cholera diarrheal diseases, and other vector-borne diseases. The country has failed to achieve the malaria elimination target.“Every hour, one person commits suicide, the burden of non-communicable diseases has increased alarmingly, and neonatal deaths have not declined in the past several years,” said Shrestha. “Several programmes of health, including a free screening of cervical cancer and renal problems in the state-run health facilities, could not be implemented due to various reasons. The budget allocated for health even does not support continuing the ongoing programmes.”Experts caution that budgetary cuts in crucial healthcare programmes would have a long-term impact and could affect the achievements made over the years.“The government has not allocated the health budget to strengthen the federal structures,” said Dr Padam Bahadur Chand, former chief of the Policy Planning and International Cooperation Division at the Ministry of Health. “Most of the health budget will be spent on the salaries of the staffers.” \nNepal on Friday confirmed the spread of the Covid sub-lineages KP.1, KP.2, KP.3, and KP.4 in the country.All the sub-variants are offshoots of the Omicron variant, which is considered responsible for the surge in new cases of coronavirus in the last few weeks.The National Public Health Laboratory, which carried out whole-genome sequencing on swab samples of coronavirus-infected persons, said that 31 out of 42 swab samples tested positive for different sub-lineages.According to a statement issued by the laboratory, the KP.2 sub-variant was confirmed in 17 swab samples, KP.1 in 12, and KP.3 and KP.4 in one sample each. Similarly, Omicron’s JN.1 was detected in 7 swab samples, and BA.2 was detected in 2 swab samples.“The Omicron’s variants JN.1 and KP.2 have high prevalence, which accounts for nearly 40 percent of samples run for sequencing,” reads the statement.The KP.2 is a member of a group of SARS-CoV-2 variants, also called “FliRT” variants.Whole-genome sequencing is a comprehensive method of analysing the entire DNA sequence of an organism’s genes. Researchers believe that whole-genome sequencing of coronavirus could be instrumental in tracking the virus's severity and properties.Nepal confirmed the spread of the JN.1 sub-variant of the coronavirus in the country in January. Given its rapid spread around the globe, the World Health Organisation classifies JN.1 as a separate ‘variant of interest’. However, the UN health body said that based on available data, “the additional public health risk posed by JN.1 is currently evaluated as low”.The UN health body has classified KP.2 as a variant under monitoring. There is no indication that KP.1 and KP.2 are more transmissible or cause more severe disease than other circulating variants. Swab samples were collected from Covid-infected persons in April and May, according to the laboratory.Hospitals in Kathmandu had reported a surge in serious cases of Covid infection in April. Doctors attending the infected patients had said that elderly people and those with underlying conditions were getting severe.Health authorities nationwide have stopped active case findings, including contact tracing and free testing for all, after the second wave of the pandemic subsided in 2021. Hospitals have been carrying out tests only on those seeking polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing to go abroad or seriously ailing patients with respiratory illness. Several countries, including India and Singapore, have reported infection with the KP.2 and KP.1 sub-variants of the coronavirus. According to media reports, India has recorded 324 cases of Covid, including 290 cases of KP.2 and 34 cases of KP.1.Experts say almost all variants of the coronavirus present in India have found their way into Nepal. Even if the JN.1 sub-variant is not as deadly as the Delta variant, the virus still poses a serious threat to the elderly and people with compromised immunity.Over 12,000 people died, and hundreds of thousands were infected in the first, second and third waves of the Covid pandemic. \nHealth authorities have failed to locate the whereabouts of over 1,500 girls who were jabbed with the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine once but did not show up for a second dose.Officials at the Ministry of Health and Population said that health agencies in all seven provinces have been making phone calls and requesting them to come for a second dose of the vaccine.“Hundreds of girls aged between 14 and 15 years did not show up for the second dose of HPV vaccine, as they were preparing for secondary education examinations (SEE),” said Dr Abhiyan Gautam, chief of the Immunisation Section at the Family Welfare Division under the Department of Health Services. “After they completed the exam, some returned to their homes and others to cities for further studies.”The health ministry’s data shows 9,980 girls between 14 and 15 years of age from the seven provinces were jabbed with the first dose of the HPV vaccine in a pilot programme launched in September last year. Those who were administered the first dose were supposed to take the second dose of vaccine in six months.Health authorities first launched the second dose vaccination in federal hospitals in all the provinces, but due to a low uptake, they sent vaccinators to schools. The vaccination programme was suspended later after vaccinators failed to track the girls who were administered the first dose.Officials hoped that girls would seek a second dose of the vaccine after completing the SEE examination, but that too did not happen.Human papillomavirus is a viral infection that spreads through skin contact. The virus causes cervical cancer, which is the second most common cancer in the developing world and a major cause of death among Nepali women. Hundreds of women get diagnosed with cervical cancer every year in Nepal.According to the BP Koirala Memorial Cancer Hospital in Bharatpur, more than 700 women suffering from cervical cancer seek treatment at the hospital every year.Doctors say most cervical cancer cases are associated with HPV, a sexually transmitted infection and that widespread immunisation could reduce the impact of cervical and other cancers caused by the HPV worldwide.Countries like Bhutan, Sri Lanka, Thailand and the Maldives have introduced the HPV vaccine nationally, while India and Indonesia have introduced it in some districts.In 2016, Nepal piloted HPV vaccination in Chitwan and Kaski districts. All girls aged between 11 and 13 years were then given two doses of the vaccine.Experts say early treatment prevents up to 80 percent of cervical cancer.HPV vaccination was also included in the government’s policies and programmes for the next fiscal year 2024-25, which is a repetition of the past several years. Health ministry officials, who used to claim that HPV vaccination would be available to all eligible girls in 2022, said a nationwide HPV vaccination drive is likely in 2025 only.The ministry plans to inoculate around 1.7 million girls between 10 and 14 years with the HPV vaccine through nationwide drives and also make it part of regular immunisation.According to officials, the Global Alliance for Vaccine and Immunisation (GAVI) has agreed to provide HPV vaccine doses. Once the campaign is completed, the vaccine will be included in the government’s routine immunisation programme.Nepal submitted a proposal to GAVI in July last year requesting free HPV doses so that the vaccine could be included on the regular immunisation list. Ministry officials say they have proposed a budget for nationwide HPV vaccination campaigns in 2025.Officials say that GAVI has already agreed to provide required vaccine doses, but the problem is their availability. The World Health Organisation says HPV vaccination is recommended as part of a coordinated strategy to prevent cervical cancer and other diseases caused by the virus.The UN health body says HPV is responsible for more than 70 percent of cervical cancer cases in women. Countries that have included the HPV vaccine in their regular immunisation list have successfully reduced cervical cancer cases in women, according to doctors. \nAditya Mishra is a Nepali chef and entrepreneur based in New York. Passionate about elevating Nepali cuisine globally, Mishra sharpened his culinary skills while staging at various Michelin-starred restaurants in the city during his time at culinary school. A recipient of the James Beard Foundation National Scholars Scholarship in 2023, Mishra’s early experiences inspired him to establish his own supper club, ‘The Sewing Tin’, alongside co-founder Akhil Upad.In an interview with Post’s Aarati Ray, Mishra discusses his restaurant in New York, serving Nepali cuisines there and the recipe for his signature dish.How did your cooking journey start in New York?At 14, I told my parents I wanted to be a chef, but they preferred I pursue a stable career like engineering, as many Nepali families do. So, I left for Louisiana in 2019 to study engineering.But, cooking never left my heart so, after a year, I left engineering college and moved to New York City. It’s been three and a half years and my parents only learned about it later. When my mom visited me in NYC and saw my dedication to cooking, she saw my passion and supported my decision.What sparked your interest in cooking from a young age?As a child, I was drawn to cooking shows on TLC. The glamour of cooking, eating, travelling and the prosperity of famous chefs was fascinating.Around age 16, I discovered Chef Anthony Bourdain’s groundbreaking book, ‘Kitchen Confidential’, which shed light on the reality of the culinary industry. I learned how he became a cultural icon in NYC, reshaping perceptions of chefs.I was also fascinated by chefs like Marco Pierre White, who was a mentor to Gordon Ramsay. Their stories of achieving fame while maintaining discipline intrigued me. But, as I grew older and entered the culinary world, I realised it was far from glamorous—it involved dedication and I am glad I persevered.How did the idea for The Sewing Tin originate?The concept of ‘The Sewing Tin’ came when I realised the stark contrast between the romanticised view of kitchen work and its harsh reality. Witnessing the struggles of many kitchen staff—economic hardships, immigration challenges and language barriers—I had to rediscover my love for cooking.During my internship at ‘Junoon’ restaurant, I met my co-founder, Akhil Upad, who shared my culinary enthusiasm despite his preparations for medical college. Together, we wanted to create a dining experience that was more personal and communal, offering fine dining with a sense of community.We wanted our food to tell stories, so we named our restaurant ‘The Sewing Tin’ inspired by the immigrant experience in NYC. When immigrants opened cookie boxes as kids, they often found sewing supplies instead of food.‘The Sewing Tin’ is like opening a cookie box and finding sewing supplies—something uniquely desi, or South Asian. How do you promote Nepali cuisine in New York City through The Sewing Tin?My partner is from Atlanta with Indian roots, while I come from Nepal, so our menu celebrates and reflects both cultures and heritage.We represent our respective cultures authentically. For example, we have a dish inspired by Newari cuisine called kachaila, similar to French Tartar. We present it as Tartar to make it accessible to our customers but infuse it with Nepali flavours, telling stories about its origins and giving diners a taste of my homeland.What do you think of the prospects of Nepali cuisine abroad?I’m on a mission to share Nepali food worldwide. I have served up dishes like chatamari and lamb sekuwa in my restaurant. But I’m still learning and want to explore more of Nepal’s cuisines. My big dream? To make Nepali cuisine reach more places because it’s got something special that can wow taste buds everywhere.How do you see the changes in restaurants in Nepal?The restaurant industry has deep roots in community and bringing people together, dating back centuries. While this core idea remains, modern restaurants have evolved, making changes to adapt to the times.Yet, in Nepal, despite the growing number of restaurants, many lack uniqueness and storytelling, focusing more on making money than fostering a sense of community.I’ve noticed a troubling trend of rising prices, especially for beloved dishes like momos, which makes people question if they're getting value for their money. It seems like profits are taking precedence over creating genuine, authentic culinary experiences.The industry is starting to lose the creativity and passion that once made it special. It might be time for chefs to shake things up, challenge the norm and bring fresh ideas to the table, revitalising the culinary scene with renewed energy and creativity.What challenges have you faced in New York as an outsider?Living in a bustling city like New York as an outsider has its challenges. But, this city is also full of opportunities for those who are passionate. If you stay true to your culture and want to share your story, opportunities are waiting for you.Even though it can be daunting because of the tough competition, the city appreciates determination and expertise. When I started my journey here, all I wanted to do was cook, eat and share the story of Nepal and its diverse cultures. Instead of focusing on the difficulties, I embraced the chance to follow my passion.What do you think about the criticism of blending Nepali food with modern culinary styles?Chefs care about their food—it’s like they’re sharing a story. They’ve put in a lot of effort to become skilled, so let them be creative. It’s okay to give helpful advice but don’t be mean just to criticise. Chefs shouldn’t also just copy what’s popular, they should cook what they truly love. That’s what makes food special and meaningful.Mishra’s signature dish:Confit Duck Chatamari A traditional Nepali delicacy with French influence.Ingredients:Duck (Legs and breast)Rice (soaked overnight)MayonnaiseWhole spices (cloves, cinnamon, cardamom, bay leaf)Red onionGarlicGingerMula ko achar (Fermented radish)ScallionsLemon juiceNepali pepperVinegarSaltSugarProcedure:For the Duck:Season duck with salt and pepper.Cook in a covered pan with whole spices, garlic, and ginger at low heat for 2 hours on a stove (270 degrees in the oven)Increase heat to crisp up the skin (approximately 15 minutes).Shred the duck meat.Confit Garlic Aioli:Mash cooked garlic and ginger and mix with mayonnaise, lemon juice, Nepali pepper and fermented radishes.Pickled Onions:Slice onions and cook in a mixture of vinegar, water, salt, sugar, and whole spices until softened (about 10 minutes).For the chatamari:Blend soaked rice to make a batter, let it ferment for 6 hours, and adjust consistency with water.Assembling:Cook chatamari batter in duck fat for 4 minutes.Top with shredded duck, aioli, pickled onions and scallions.Serve \nCeleus Baral exudes a serene aura when you meet her, and when she tells you she bakes, it makes sense. Even during a brief encounter, you can tell she has the patience needed to be a baker.“You can eyeball cooking, but baking is chemistry. You have to be meticulous. You cannot rush it, or it does not turn out as expected,” says the 21-year-old environment science student. She also runs the online baking shop Bakeleus. Recently, she has also started selling her baked goods beyond her online shop, with her first stall appearing at The Yellow House’s Night Market. Bakeleus’s menu lists a variety of offerings, including jams, granola, tarts, cakes, cookies, cupcakes and brownies. Baral began baking in 2020, during the lockdown, and launched her online shop last year.She grows much of the produce she incorporates into her baking, and believes we should all understand the origins of our food. “This connection fosters gratitude and a deeper appreciation for nature,” she says. Her background in environmental science, coupled with her affinity for the natural world, imbues her creations with a unique artistic sensibility. Each item she bakes is a testament to her creativity and experimentation, as she believes consistent practice is the key to mastery.Despite the demands of being a full-time student, Baral strives to accommodate orders, typically requiring a minimum of 72 hours' notice for delivery. She is a passionate and discerning individual, evident in the love she infuses into her baking. Additionally, Baral advocates for a zero-waste policy at home, ensuring that every scrap of food and all household items are recycled.Three easy to bake recipes you can try at homeMini carrot cakes Ingredients:38 g milk or yoghurt35 g all-purpose flour1/4 tea spoon ground cinnamon1/8 tea spoon ground gingerA pinch of cardamom1 tea spoon baking powder½ tea spoon fine sea salt2 large eggs, at room temperature27 g granulated sugar13 g brown sugar (or 39 g of regular granulated sugar)1 tea spoon vanilla extract27 g extra virgin olive oil33 g carrots, peeled and shreddedChopped walnutsCandied lemon or orange slices (optional for garnish)Cream cheese frosting56.5 g unsalted butter, softened113.5 g cream cheese, softened1/2 teaspoon vanilla extractA pinch of salt250 g powdered sugarDirections:For the cake:Preheat the oven to 195°C.

The vegetable is relatively cheap and used in almost all cuisines and curries. This ubiquity could perhaps be why someone might be snubbingly called an ‘aloo’ in Nepal, but the reference does not make potatoes less important.Why have them With zero fat, potatoes contain many important nutrients—vitamins B1, B6, Vitamin C, which is an antioxidant, minerals and fibre. Along with starch, it is a good source of potassium, copper, vitamin C, manganese, phosphorus, niacin, dietary fibre and pantothenic acid. Potassium derived from potatoes is an electrolyte that benefits the heart, muscles and nervous system. Potato skin contains fibre, which is important for digestive health.Compared to other vegetables, potatoes are more energy-dense. It is free of fat, gluten, cholesterol and sodium. The relatively cheap plant-based food is also a good source of carbohydrates. Filled with nutrients, one can get a lot of them by consuming potatoes.Sourcing of potatoesPotatoes thrive in diverse climatic conditions. The country cultivates potatoes on around 200,000 hectares of land—from the plains of Tarai to the mountainous region.Every year, Nepal churns out around 3,410,000 tons of the stuff. It also imports potatoes and potato products worth Rs 8.71 billion.“These imports include potato chips, frozen potatoes and fresh potatoes,” said Biswas Poudel, a senior technical officer at the National Potato Research Programme.As its cultivation is possible in diverse landscapes, even climate change does not affect potato farming, experts say. Types of potatoesRed and white potatoes are popular and widely available in the country. Lately, dark potatoes or blue potatoes are gaining popularity.“Red potatoes are highly popular,” said Poudel. “Potatoes that come in colour contain more nutrients. Darker potatoes are packed with antioxidants.”Potatoes that taste sweet are a good source of vitamin A, an important nutrient for immunity and eye health. Purple potatoes are rich in antioxidants, including anthocyanins that may prevent heart disease and cancer and boost brain health.Other benefits As potatoes contain important nutrients, they benefit human health in multiple ways. Iron, phosphorus, calcium, magnesium, and zinc contained in potatoes help the body build and maintain its structure and strength. Consumption of the vegetable that is rich in potassium, calcium and magnesium helps reduce blood pressure naturally. Potatoes also contain a significant amount of fibre, which helps in lowering cholesterol levels in the blood and ultimately lessens the risk of heart disease. Fibre also boosts digestive health.Compared to other green vegetables, farmers use only a minimal amount of pesticides in potatoes, making them safe to eat. Chips and french friesOf late potato chips and french fries are gaining popularity in Nepal. They are also popular dishes in most restaurants and people have even started making french fries at home. Children love potato chips the most. Intake of nutrients and micronutrients, fibre and antioxidants components depends on how potatoes were cooked or prepared for food.Consumption of a lot of chips and french fries can lead to added calories and unhealthy weight gain.“Fibre and antioxidant and other micronutrients of the potatoes may be lost while frying,” said Poudel. “As potatoes are a carbohydrate-rich vegetable, it is not necessary to consume them with rice, which many people do in Nepal.”Experts say diabetic people should limit their potato intake as they cause spikes in blood sugar. \nChicken eggs are a healthy, nutritious superfood, containing most of the minerals and vitamins a body needs. They are relatively cheap as well. They are a complete source of protein, credited with a reduction in malnutrition in children and pregnant women in recent years in Nepal.According to nutritionists, consuming eggs daily has multiple benefits including weight loss, reduced blood pressure and protection against infections.Sourcing of our eggs Nepal is self-reliant on chicken eggs. According to the Nepal Egg Producers Association, poultry farmers in the country produce 3.1 million eggs a day.“Our production is sufficient to meet domestic demand,” said Shiva Ram KC, chairman of the association.Sizes and types Eggs are mostly available in two sizes—big and medium. Big-sized eggs cost Rs450 a crate (30 eggs) while medium-sized ones cost Rs435 a crate. Pastured eggs or eggs from local chickens are also available but they cost more than double the price of eggs produced in poultry farms. These are called Omega-3-enriched eggs, which are more nutritious than those produced on farms. Nutritionists say such eggs contain higher amounts of Omega-3 fat and are high in vitamins A and E. Omega-3 fatty acids are also known to reduce blood levels of triglycerides, a well-known risk factor for heart disease. As pastured eggs are scarce, one has to directly contact farmers to buy them. Officials at the Department of Food Technology said that generally, pastured eggs are not produced in bulk, but they may be made available through some trusted suppliers. Why have them, and how many? As chicken eggs are rich in protein, most minerals and vitamins, there are multiple reasons to take them. A whole egg contains Vitamin A, Vitamin B9, Vitamin B5, Vitamin B 12, Vitamin B 2, Vitamin D, E, B6, minerals—phosphorus, selenium, calcium and zinc.“A healthy adult can eat 1–2 eggs a day without hesitation,” said Dr Atul Upadhyay, a nutritionist. “A whole egg contains almost all the nutrients a body needs.”What about the quality of eggs? No agency in the country is checking the quality of the eggs being sent to the market. The issue of excessive use of antibiotics in chicken is often raised but no one talks about the presence of antibiotic residue in eggs.Studies in other countries including India show high levels of antibiotic-resistant pathogens in chickens raised for meat and eggs.The Department of Food Technology and Quality Control examines the quality of processed foods containing eggs but does not check the quality of eggs per se. Experts say there is no mechanism in the country to ascertain the quality of eggs. It is also difficult to determine the quality of eggs by merely looking at them, for instance whether they have thick or thin shells.Other benefits Eggs help in weight loss and strengthening prenatal bone. They increase mental energy. The lutein in the eggs enhances skin’s moisture and the protein helps tighten the skin. Egg yolk boosts skin complexion, as they are high in fatty acids, nutritionists say.Daily consumption of eggs might lower the risk of stroke. Antioxidants lutein and zeaxanthin contained in eggs help prevent eye diseases like cataracts and age-related muscle degeneration. Choline in eggs is important for pregnant women and breastfeeding mothers, as it helps with baby’s brain development. \nLocated in Bakhundole, Lalitpur, Piano Piano South stands as a serene oasis offering a delightful escape from the city’s hustle and bustle.

It passes through several indigenous ethnic villages and landscapes in Khotang and Bhojpur districts. This trail goes up to an elevation of 4,200 metres to the viewpoint of Silchung Peak and takes one through the settlements of the Kirati people. This route starts from Diktel Bazaar and passes through beautiful settlements like Chakhewa, Rawa Dhap, Salpa Bhanjyang, Silchung and Hanspokhari before ending in Bhojpur. There are some hotels in Diktel but trekkers are advised to carry tents. The trail offers panoramic views of most of the eight-thousanders, including Everest, Lhotse, Makalu, Cho Oyu and Kanchenjunga mountains. The spring season, March through May, is highly recommended for the trek.Janaki Mandir Janaki Mandir at Janakpur in Madhesh province was constructed in 1874 and is a blend of Mughal and local architecture. The temple is a three-storey building and has 60 rooms, making it the largest temple in Nepal. Pilgrims flock here by the thousands to pay homage to Janaki Mandir—Janaki being the other name of Sita, the daughter of King Janak. The temple houses an idol of Sita which was found near Ayodhya, the kingdom of Ram. The marriage anniversary of Lord Ram and Sita is celebrated in Janakpur every year on Vivaha Panchami, which falls in December. In the southwest corner of Janaki Mandir is the Vivaha Mandap, which has been built at the site where the marriage of Ram and Sita is said to have taken place. Another well-known temple in the vicinity is Ram Mandir, which is built in pagoda style and is hence different from the other temples in Janakpur that generally bear resemblance to Mughal architecture. It houses a female statue, said to be of Yogamaya, which has the reputation of being one of the most beautiful images of female forms in Nepal. Other holy sites of interest include the Laxman Temple, Sankat Mochan Temple and Hanuman Temple.Kuri Village, Kalinchok Kuri village, a popular tourist destination around 150 km from Kathmandu, lies at an altitude of 3,842 metres above sea level in Kalinchowk of Dolakha district, in Bagmati province. People visit the place to enjoy the snow during the winter besides the mesmerising landscapes and splendid panoramic view of the Himalayan range. Kalinchok gets snow mainly at the end of December and the snowfall continues till the end of February or mid-March. When there is snow, it is difficult for jeeps, buses and cars to reach the top of Kuri village. Chains are wrapped around the wheels of vehicles and specially modified jeeps with highly experienced drivers are used to carry visitors. There are several hotels and restaurants in the area. The road up to Kuri has also improved over the years.Annapurna Base Camp Annapurna Base Camp trek, in Gandaki province, makes for a picturesque journey that takes you to the foothills of the Annapurna South, up to 4,130 metres above sea level. The five-day trek (seven days for slow walkers) offers rich cultural diversities, typical Nepali villages and the flora and fauna nestled at the foothills of Annapurna. The distance from Pokhara to Annapurna Base Camp is approximately 81 kilometres. It is among the shortest and most budget-friendly treks in Nepal. For Nepalis, lodging costs around $5 to $10 per day. For foreigners, the overall cost of the trek ranges from $800 to $1500 on average per person. Annapurna Base Camp trek can be done at any time throughout the year as each season offers a different trekking experience. The ideal time for the trek depends on your weather preferences and what you expect from it. However, autumn (September to October) and spring (March to May) are considered the two best seasons for the trek, as the days at the time are warm and bright with clear skies.Bardiya National Park Bardiya National Park, located in the southern Tarai belt of Lumbini province, is home to one of the most elusive and majestic animals on earth—the Royal Bengal Tiger. The park, which covers an area of 968 square kilometres, is considered one of the most important protected areas in the country. It is a prime destination for those looking to catch a glimpse of a tiger. A bit of luck and patience will offer a good chance to see the Bengal Tiger. The jungle safari also offers one the opportunity to spot Asian elephants and the greater one-horned rhinoceros. The rare Gangetic river dolphins are occasionally spotted on rafting trips along the Geruwa River, the eastern channel of the Karnali river. Besides, visitors can enjoy the homestays and explore local Tharu culture. The right time to visit the park is from mid-September to mid-December and mid-February to May.Khaptad National Park Khaptad National Park in Sudurpaschim province is a protected area in the far western region. It stretches over four districts of Bajhang, Bajura, Achham and Doti and ranges in elevation from 1,400 to 3,300 metres. The park can be visited throughout the year. Trekkers are advised to bring their tents, food and other supplies. The Nepal Tourism Board says of late, social media has been increasingly influencing Nepali travellers to go to Khaptad. Since the far-flung Khaptad National Park is still offbeat for many travellers, the area remains pristine and fresh. The seasons of spring (March-May) and autumn (October-November) are the ideal times to visit the park. The temperature ranges from 10°c to 20°c offering pleasant trekking weather. The monsoon begins in June and lasts until September and during this time, roads often become muddy and slippery. From December to February, winter brings snow and chilling winds to the park.Limi Valley \nOnce again, my heart swelled with joy when my hometown came into view.Arriving at Lalikharka after the treacherous journey through Pauwa Bhanjyang and the bustling Kanchhi Dokan, Phidim, the headquarters of Panchthar district, revealed itself like a surprise gift. My home town, Phidim, is unique in the fact that it reveals to travellers approaching it from uphill. As the vehicle descends the mountain road, it slowly comes into view, its houses and buildings recognisable for the native son.This Dashain, I undertook the much-awaited trip to my hometown with my wife Kabita and daughter Aarohi. Little did I anticipate the transformation that awaited me.The moment I got out of the jeep, I noticed that Phidim, nestled in the lush hills, has undergone a remarkable transformation over the years. As I guided my family to my home, which had suffered damages in the 1989 quake that struck eastern Nepal, I found that old, mud and stone houses had been replaced by concrete buildings. The place was vastly different from the one I remembered.Arriving at my childhood home felt like reuniting with an old friend. Navigating its nooks and crannies with my daughter, we delved into the history of the house, a symbol of my cherished memories.My wife had visited Phidim years ago, spending a month with my parents. She, too, recalled beautiful moments she had had in the town. I asked the tenant about the neighbours and acquaintances. Some had died, while others had left for good.A call to local journalist Giriraj Banskota led me to the school grounds, where memories flooded back. This was where I spent my teenage years, playing ball, learning to kick, and watching major tournaments. Here, I even encountered a group of Western climbers headed to Kanchenjunga, the world’s third-highest mountain. I remember being awed by their shiny yellow tents, headlights and strange smell. I remember practising my tutephuteko Angrezi with the climbers. Birendra Shield, an annual sports tournament named after the late king, brought ace players from various schools in Panchthar district. The district also hosted Yuba Mela, an annual three-day fair to commemorate the birthday of the king, organising football tournaments in which teams from as far as Sunsari and Taplejung participated. I never excelled at dribbling balls. A boy growing up in a seven-member family, I soon found my interest in literature. In the late 1980s, Phidim hosted a major literary festival. In the run-up to the 1990 pro-democracy protest, walls were painted with anti-monarchy slogans, local politicians were arrested. I took my family to my school, Naya Namuna Secondary School. It was Saturday, so the school was closed. I peeked through the steel gate and wall, imagining myself labouring over classes. Memories are hazy, but what I remember most is going out of the school—to quiz contests with me leading the school team, to essay competitions at the District Education Office and to play carom board, a national pastime, in a nearby shopfront. Returning to the main street, the demolition of a landmark gate made me reflect on how cities transform, shedding old landmarks for new identities. Navigating narrow alleyways, I felt like a stranger in my own hometown. Multistory buildings have emerged and roads have been paved, reshaping the town. It’s the same place with a different face, leaving me nostalgic for the Phidim of my memories.We finally reached Shivalaya temple, which I told my wife and daughter was one of my cherished hangouts. A giant statue of Falgunanda (the Kirant leader’s birthday is celebrated on November 10) stood before the steps to the temple. Though my wife suspected I came here to smoke, in reality, I visited the temple in the evening to meet friends and talk about issues that mattered most to us at the time. It also offered a panoramic view of the town (I could not take my family to Gadhi Danda, a hillock across the Shivalaya).Towards the end of my journey, I felt sad about Phidim’s lack of prospects. To my dismay, I found that people have been leaving the town in droves. Despite blacktopped roads and multi-story buildings, Phidim faces a troubling reality. The lack of quality higher education and specialist healthcare has driven people away, echoing the circumstances that led me to Kathmandu years ago. Conversations with locals confirmed a mass exodus from the town, a trend that raises concerns about Phidim's future.My conversations with familiar strangers led me to conclude that Phidim has transformed into a transit town for pilgrims heading to Pathibhara Devi Temple, which is around 255 kilometres north in Taplejung district. I met dozens of people headed to the holy site. While pilgrims see it as a stopover, for me, it was a homecoming. The realisation dawned that Phidim is, perhaps, in a state of transition, trading its rustic charm for the hallmarks of urbanisation. While I left Phidim for higher education in Kathmandu, people from rural areas have flocked to the town in search of better opportunities, bringing life and energy to the once quiet community.As we bid adieu to my hometown, I couldn’t help but reflect on the inevitability of leaving a place, no matter how enamoured one is with it. Passing Kanchhi Dokan, I pointed out Kanchnajungha and Kumbhakarna to my daughter—symbols of my childhood. Phidim, now a blend of nostalgia and change, remains etched in my heart, a testament to the intricate dance between memory and evolution. \nThe gate leading inside the city of Lucknow proudly declares, “Muskuraiye aap Lucknow mein hain” (Smile because you are in Lucknow). During my brief stay, the city lived upto its promise. Known as the city of Nawabs, with a rich history going centuries back, the city is abuzz with autos, rickshaws, honks of public buses and the constant loud sounds of the metro going over your head, irritable honks of public buses and food that leaves you wanting more.In such a happening place stands Bara Imambara, built in 1784 by Asaf-ud-Daula. ‘Bara’ means big, and ‘Imambara’ is a building with a big hall where people assemble for mourning congregations. This building was originally built to provide employment for the public because, at that period, the country was going through a famine, and it was seen as a relief project. I walked through the grand entrance gate known as Rumi Darwaza (Turkish Gate), wiping my sweat and fighting the Lucknow heat, entering the vast complex. Echoing in all corners was a voice from the speaker that kept reminding the visitors of the many rules inside the historical place. I tried not to let the wonder overwhelm me as I walked through the complex. To my right stood the elegant Asafi Mosque, recently painted in cream-like white. Its design is visually pleasing and a testament to the Mughal era’s artistic finesse. Its walls are adorned with intricate calligraphy and elegant designs, reminiscent of a time when such aesthetics held great importance. I couldn’t help but admire the tremendous effort the craftsmen put into bringing the Nawab’s vision to life, meticulously crafting the elegant domes which seemed to touch the sky. The mosque’s serene atmosphere stands in stark contrast to the bustling city just beyond its walls.Upon stepping into the main hall—known as Asafi Hall—I was immediately struck by its sheer size. It is vast and impressive, appearing to stretch into eternity, and its massive arched roof seemed to defy gravity. What’s even more intriguing is that it stands without the support of pillars or beams. The interlocking system of bricks, a hidden secret, upholds this colossal structure, leaving one in awe of the brilliance of the builders of the past.This very hall houses a large vaulted central chamber with the tomb of Asaf-ud-Daula. Standing beside his tomb was a chilling moment, knowing that the remains of a great historical figure was resting just a few feet below. After scanning the large hall, the guide took me to my favourite part of the Imambara—the labyrinth or the Bhool Bhulaiyaa. This labyrinth sits right above the main hall, and because the hall is unsupported, the ceiling had to be lightweight, so the hollow labyrinth was born. It is quite impossible to figure out the Bhool Bhulaiyaa on your own, as it is a confusing network of corridors and staircases. So, it is necessary to have the company and guidance of a guide.As I moved with my guide through the maze, I thought I could feel the presence of the past inhabitants who had walked through these confusing passageways. What fascinated me most was the maze’s design: every sound, no matter how faint, echoed through the structure, enhancing its aura of mystery.The guide whispered from a distance, his head close to the wall, and the sound reached my ears, even though he was out of sight. It felt as if the walls carried the whispers. We exchanged astonished glances. When the guide reappeared, he smiled and remarked, “Now, you understand why they say that walls have ears.”Exiting the maze, I climbed to the roof, which offered a breathtaking view of Lucknow. The city spread out in front of me, its modern skyline contrasting the monument’s historic charm. It was a moment of reflection, contemplating how centuries had passed, and yet, Bara Imambara stood as a timeless witness to the changing tides of history. As I stood there, taking it all in, I felt recharged by the air coming in from all directions. After descending from the terrace, my brisk guide led me to the final stop in the Imambara, Shahi Baoli (Stepwell). Also referred to as the royal stepwell, it sits underground and is another example of architectural brilliance in the complex. This didn’t surprise me much since it was built at a time when architecture wasn’t just functional but also a work of art.The moment I descended the steps that led me underground, I noticed the sudden drop in temperature. The Shahi Baoli served as a cool refuge during the blistering summer day. The well-planned architecture of the Baoli allowed it to naturally regulate its temperature. The way to the main well is locked, but visitors can throw coins through jail-like doors into the well in order to try out their luck, much like we do in Davis Falls in Pokhara.Entering the underground corridors, I felt a slight chill because it was cold and dimly lit. I turned on my phone’s flashlight and saw the walls adorned with intricate Mughal carvings. Upon reaching a spot where we could see the well, the guide informed us that the well acted as a CCTV camera at the time. He explained that individuals inside the structure could discreetly observe those entering, as their reflections would be visible on the well’s water, but the people entering could not see the people inside the building.I waited to see that happen, and when a group entered through the gate, I was stunned; their faces were perfectly mirrored on the water’s surface, showcasing the ingenuity behind the well’s design, serving both as a water source and a security measure.My experience at Bara Imambara was a delightful one. I had never seen such a remarkable work of architecture before—it is beautiful, interesting and ahead of its time. \nSerene, snow-capped mountains set against the bluest skies. It’s a heavenly sight in pictures but mighty hard to climb in real life. Climbing Everest, Annapurna, or Manaslu means enduring freezing cold, biting air, and days of physical and mental strain until you reach the summit. The journey is a slippery path of rocks, rivers, and bridges, navigated skillfully by experienced trekkers, locals, and guides. In 2022, Nepal welcomed 15,781 trekkers, highlighting the importance of climbing and trekking guides for the country's economy.For new trekkers, understanding the trek can be confusing. If you’re anxious about missing something in your backpack or need motivation to start a trek, here are tips from two seasoned guides to help you grasp the essentials.Meet Luckme Syangden, a 25-year-old climbing guide with extensive experience in the treacherous heights of Everest. According to Syangden, maintaining a positive mindset is the first step towards a successful climb, both before and throughout the entire process.Preparation for the journeyTrekking is undeniably demanding, both physically and mentally. However, maintaining a ‘can-do’ attitude can go a long way in pushing people to their destination, says Syangden. “We never force the people to push through if we think they’ve reached their limits, but we do try to use ourselves as an example to show that they can,” says Syangden. According to Syangden, when you’re guiding so many people through the process of climbing, you realise that everybody is different; their bodies have different needs and limitations. So it’s important to move forward while assessing their physical and mental well-being. “We always maintain a strong, positive mindset ourselves and strive to inspire our trekkers with the same optimism. Rushing them when they’re unwell isn’t our approach,” says Syangden.Manu Rai, 32, has been a trekking guide for three years. Her passion for physical activities and exploring the vast landscapes of her village led her to this profession. Rai, an avid walker and traveller, found her calling when she met fellow adventure enthusiasts who shared her love for hiking and trekking. According to Rai, engaging in physical activities and regular workouts can significantly enhance the strength needed for embarking confidently on a trek.For novice trekkers, it’s advisable to begin preparing at least a month prior to the trek. Joining a gym or engaging in physical activities like walking can make a significant difference. Start with a 20-minute walk on the first day and gradually extend the duration as the trek approaches. This gradual increase helps in building strength, endurance, and confidence. Additionally, regular stretching is essential to loosen the muscles, reducing the risk of injuries while navigating challenging terrains. Personally, I've found going to the gym and incorporating squats into my routine immensely beneficial in strengthening my leg muscles. Backpacking essentialsWhen backpacking, packing wisely is key. Rai advises opting for light yet warm clothing instead of bulky jackets to reduce the load. She recommends essentials like down jackets, caps, goggles, sunglasses, sunscreen, a stick, warmer, gloves, socks, and sturdy boots. Syangden, who also carries the same essentials, stresses the importance of carrying a safety knife and period supplies for female trekkers.Managing periods during treksManaging periods during treks can be challenging, as Syangden points out. “I carry all of the supplies that I need, but as you can imagine, handling period cramps and all the other symptoms while trekking through gruelling mountains is no easy task. I just do my best to power through it all,” says Syangden.Handling altitude sickness and injuriesRai advises trekkers to rest and wait if altitude sickness strikes. Carrying painkillers and paracetamol is essential. If conditions worsen, trekkers can choose to halt their trip. In such cases, communication with fellow travellers and guides is key. Guides can also arrange transportation for the trekker’s return if needed. Effective communication with trekkers and guidesSyangden highlights the importance of communication and building positive relationships with fellow trekkers. Over her journey from being a beginner to a seasoned guide, she has learned that talking and fostering a friendly rapport with clients significantly smoothens the trek.“In my initial guiding days, communication was tough, but now I can confidently lead trekking groups,” Syangden states.Challenges faced by a female trekkersBoth Syangden and Rai acknowledge the challenges faced by female trekkers. They often encounter underestimation and demeaning comments questioning their trekking abilities. Syangden has personally dealt with such remarks, reflecting a wider issue where being a woman is wrongly linked to an inability to handle the physical demands of trekking. Becoming a trekking guideTrekkers and adventure-seekers may come to the realisation that their love for the mountains and hills can translate itself to a profession that not only supports their own passion but also that of those enthusiastic about the secrets of the mountains. According to both Syangden and Rai, the first step is to connect with a trekking association and enrol in a trekking guide course. Rai explains that this course covers essential skills like map reading, navigation, guiding techniques, geography, safety measures, and environmental knowledge.Additionally, Syangden, who is currently undergoing a climbing course, mentions that colleges now offer bachelor’s programmes in mountaineering, providing a comprehensive education for aspiring guides. \nFive young female travellers, Binita Jirel, Menuka Gurung, Juliana Shrestha, Rejina Tamang, and Shanti Rai, noticed a gap in the outdoor industry for a women-specific platform. So, they set out to build a platform that would encourage and empower women to travel the world and launched Duluwa Outdoors in 2021.The organisation’s social media posts generate much interest from women who want to travel alone but haven’t yet. The platform has become a hub for women to connect and share experiences. Shrestha discussed the possibilities of solo travelling for women in Nepal and her tips to individuals who are just starting their journey with the Post.Is travelling alone safe in Nepal? Since it has long been a well-liked vacation spot (for international tourists), Nepal has seen a lot of solo travellers. Besides the large number of foreigners exploring the Himalayas during their gap years, many Nepalis also travel the country solo. Most of them finish their journeys safely. So yes, Nepal is pretty safe for solo travelling.An example many overlook while talking about females travelling solo in Nepal is women travelling from their house to their parent’s house alone. This has been happening for decades and is a common thing most married women do multiple times in their lives. I say everyone should try travelling by themselves at least once in their life. I’m happy to see that many young people are travelling solo these days.What are some good solo travel destinations in Nepal?It’s tough to pick out just ten, as preferences vary from person to person. If you’re new to travelling alone, consider starting small with activities like going to the movies or having dinner alone. You could also begin hiking to places like Shivapuri, Namo Buddha, or Champadevi in Kathmandu.As you become more comfortable with solo travel, you can take short trips, like a long weekend in Pokhara-Bandipur. Make sure you consider nearby resources and the availability of transportation before you start your trips. When you return, I encourage you to reflect on your journey and see what you’ve learned—about yourself and the world. Then challenge yourself a little bit more. Nepal has so much to offer from trekking in the mountains. The Annapurna area is a great place to start. The trails are accessible and well-maintained, with plenty of facilities. You’ll also find other trekkers to connect with along the way. For those interested in exploring the valleys and towns along the hills, try places like Illam, Dharan-Dhankuta, and Palpa.Finally, for those looking to experience Nepal’s rich wildlife, destinations like Chitwan, Bardiya, and Shuklaphanta are all great choices.What are your tips for people who are just starting to travel alone?Plan at all times! Do your research on the fundamentals of travel, including transportation, lodging, connectivity, risk assessment, and activities.It’s also crucial to understand the type of trail or journey you’re taking so that you can dress appropriately and prepare for any potential risks, such as altitude sickness or accidents.Remember to budget appropriately and always have an emergency fund and research prices of essentials to avoid getting ripped off.What are some travel safety tips you swear by?Safety is a personal and situational concern that frequently arises when women travel alone.If you are just starting out, I’d advise you to get to a settlement before it gets dark—by 4:30-5:00 pm—when you are on long treks. Stay there overnight and continue on your journey the next morning.Be wary of wild animal attacks or possible natural disasters when you’re out in the wilderness. I would also suggest you consider taking a wilderness first aid course.Most importantly, be wary of other people. Trust your gut. If you think someone is suspect, keep your distance. Keep your loved ones, friends, or anyone else in your support network informed of your whereabouts, especially if you’re going to be in a place without service. Let them know when you might get service again so they won’t worry. \nNepal will aim to impress at the 2024 ICC Men’s T20 World Cup in the United States and the West Indies when they launch their campaign against the Netherlands at the Grand Prairie Stadium in Dallas on Tuesday.Drawn in Group D, the Rhinos will play their next group matches against Sri Lanka in Florida on June 12, followed by clashes against South Africa on June 15 and against Bangladesh on June 17 in the Caribbean. Nepal, ranked 17th in the men’s T20I, are one of the top four highest-placed associated nations in the tournament. The young guns, led by 21-year-old captain Rohit Paudel, have the potential to cause an upset at the cricket tournament’s biggest stage and will aim to make history by progressing from the group stage.The top two teams from each of the four groups will reach the Super Eight stage. But their recent form—and a group including three full member nations and surprise elements the Netherlands—suggests that making it into the Super Eight will be difficult.Nepal will be making their first appearance at the World Cup since the World T20 in Bangladesh in 2014. They have never qualified for the 50-over Cricket World Cup and are the least experienced side in the group.They are heading into the World Cup following a series of disappointing results, including the ACC Men’s T20 Premier Cup debacle and a heavy 63-run warm-up defeat against Canada.Inconsistencies with the bat have been one of their biggest headaches so far.Openers Kushal Bhurtel and Aasif Sheikh have failed to live up to the billing lately, resulting in a failure to give the team a good start. Three years ago, on April 17, 2021, when the duo fearlessly put on a record-breaking 116-run opening stand against the Netherlands in their T20I debut in Kirtipur during the Nepal Tri-Nation T20I Series, the impression was that Nepal had finally found the missing piece of their top batting order.However, questions have been raised over their form as the opening duo has failed to build any impressive partnership recently, especially this year.Bhurtel—despite being one of the three Nepali batters alongside Paudel and Dipendra Singh Airee to have crossed 1,000 T20I runs—is experiencing the worst year of his career and is showing no signs of improvement. In his last four T20I innings, he was dismissed for three ducks in a row during the Premier Cup, and for 10 runs against Canada during the World Cup warm-up. In between, he played knocks of 16, 2, 1 and 13 against West Indies A.Shiekh has also been unsteady with the bat. He scored a fifty against West Indies A and 22 against Canada in the World Cup warm-up but failed to cross double-digit figures in his previous four outings.Nepal’s batting display will heavily rely on skipper Paudel, who usually bats at number three, and big-hitter finisher Airee.Paudel is the most consistent batter in the Nepal squad. He is at his prime and entering the World Cup having scored 265 runs in his four innings that included a century and two half-centuries against West Indies A.Allrounder Airee holds the record for fastest T20I fifty. More recently, he entered the elite club when he smashed six sixes in an over against Qatar during the T20I Premier Cup, becoming the only third man to do so after Yuvraj Singh in 2007 and Keiron Pollard in 2021.Airee will certainly be the trump card of Nepal’s batting order at the World Cup.Kushal Malla, whose 34-ball hundred against Mongolia is the second fastest T20I century, is also expected to kindle fireworks.Nepal’s bowling unit will be another key strength at the World Cup, as they demonstrated in the warm-up game against Canada. They proved effective in the middle overs and struck five times in the space of 27 deliveries to limit Canada from 111-2 in the 14th over to 135-7 in the 18th over.All-rounder Sompal Kami—the only player from Nepal’s 2014 World Cup squad to feature in the 2024 edition—will bring hordes of experience in the bowling department and will lead the fast bowling alongside cult hero Karan KC, who is the highest wicket-taker in Nepal’s squad with 90 wickets from 68 innings.Lalit Rajbanshi will lead the spin threat alongside Sagar Dhakal, who is proving his worth by taking seven wickets in his last four matches.However, all eyes will be on Abinash Bohara, who will be crucial for Nepal at the back end of the innings as the majority of his wickets have come in the death overs. Since making his debut in 2019, Bohara has taken 74 wickets from 56 innings, which is the third highest for Nepal.Nepal will still be the heavy underdogs in the group, especially against 2014 world champions Sri Lanka and 2009 and 2014 semi-finalists South Africa. This will be the first time Nepal will face Sri Lanka and South Africa. Paudel, who is the youngest captain in the United States and the West Indies among the 20 participating nations, believes Nepal can do well at the World Cup. “I have faith in my team. They will give their best, be it in opening batting or other departments,” said Paudel, who added that the role of openers would be important. “It is upon the opening batters to get the team off to a good start,” he added.“In T20 cricket, no team is really a favourite. The Netherlands defeated Sri Lanka in the warm-up game. The United States beat Bangladesh twice for a historic 2-1 series victory. That’s why I believe we can and we will [compete].”If Nepal are to build momentum for the Super Eight stage, they will need to overcome their first hurdle against familiar foes Netherlands, who are making their fifth appearance at the T20 World Cup. But it will not be an easy task against the tricky Dutch, who are on the verge of completing a hat-trick of wins against the Proteas after defeating them in the 2022 T20 World Cup and the 2023 Cricket World Cup.“Our team is focused on the Netherlands match because it is very important for us to win that game and carry the thrust to the following matches. Our players are also well aware of their respective roles,” Paudel added.Nepal can also present a thrilling challenge to a Bangladesh team, who are reeling after hitting a new low after losing a series against inexperienced and tournament debutants, the US. The Tigers also lost to Zimbabwe by eight wickets in a T20I series earlier this month.This will be the second meeting between Nepal and Bangladesh. In fact, Bangladesh defeated Nepal by eight wickets in the group stage of the 2014 World Cup and progressed into the second round. The Bangladeshis have never made it to the knockout stages across eight editions of the tournament. \nNepal’s leg spinner Sandeep Lamichhane’s hopes to participate in the 2024 ICC Men’s T20 World Cup in the United States and the West Indies all but ended after the US Embassy in Kathmandu rejected him a visa for a second time in ten days.The embassy had called Lamichhane for an interview for a second time on Thursday afternoon following a diplomatic note sent by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.Cricket Association of Nepal (CAN) had requested the government and other stakeholders to take initiatives after Lamichhane was initially denied a visa last week.CAN confirmed Lamichhane’s visa denial in a press release on Thursday.“Despite taking necessary initiatives, along with the diplomatic note, from the government of Nepal, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ministry of Youth and Sports, National Sports Council, CAN and International Cricket Council (ICC) for cricketer Sandeep Lamichhane’s visit to participate in the 2024 ICC Men's T20 World Cup in the United States and West Indies, the US Embassy has expressed its inability to give travel permission (visa) to national player Lamichhane to play the World Cup,” CAN stated. After initially denying visa to Lamichhane, the embassy had said it could not comment on individual visa cases ‘as visa records are confidential under US law.’“The US Embassy in Kathmandu and other US consular posts around the world have made a concerted effort to ensure that members of national cricket teams who qualify for the appropriate visa class are able to travel in time to compete in the World Cup,” the embassy said last week.“We cannot comment on individual visa cases as visa records are confidential under US law.”Lamichhane’s supporters had taken to streets on Wednesday to express their disappointment over visa denial to the cricketer.The country’s cricket governing body had submitted a list of only 14 players to the ICC on the May 25 deadline, leaving one slot for Lamichhane in hope that the cricketer would get a visa.The former national cricket team captain was not included in the provisional squad because the Kathmandu District Court had convicted him of raping a girl in a hotel in Kathmandu in August 2022 and had sentenced him to eight years in jail in January this year.CAN had lifted suspension on Lamichhane clearing his path to participate in the national and international cricket after Patan High Court acquited him of rape on appeal earlier this month.The cricket body had immediately started preparation to send Lamichhane to the US after lifting his ban.CAN had also talked to the ICC and secured approval from the world cricket governing body to include Lamichhane in the World Cup squad if he received a visa.Before the rape trial, Lamichhane had enjoyed a glittering career. He is the first and the only Nepali cricketer to play in the Indian Premier League. He was also sought after by T20 leagues around the globe. However, Lamichhane’s success came to a sudden fall when ‘Gaushala 26’—the name police gave to the victim—filed a rape complaint against him.Lamichhane was in Trinidad & Tobago to play in the Caribbean Premier League from Jamaica Tallawahs when the rape complaint was filed.Following the rape charge and subsequent arrest warrant issued by the Kathmandu District Court, CAN had dismissed Lamichhane as national captain and suspended him from cricket.He returned to the national team in February last year and participated in the ICC Men’s Cricket World Cup League 2 home tri-series against Namibia and Scotland, after he was freed on bail.He also travelled to Zimbabwe in June last year to participate in the ICC Cricket World Cup Qualifier and to India to play the 2023 Asia Cup three months later.Lamichhane was part of the squad that reached the semi finals of the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup Asia Qualifier in October last year to book their ticket to the T20 World Cup after a decade. Nepal made their World Cup debut in World T20 in Bangladesh in 2014.He was again suspended from cricketing activities after Kathmandu District Court convicted him in the rape charge.Lamichhane’s visa rejections means the current 15-member team, who are already in the United States, will likely play the T20 World Cup.Nepal, drawn in Group D, begin their T20 World Cup against the Netherlands on June 4 in Dallas, followed by group matches against Sri Lanka on June 12, South Africa on June 15 and Bangladesh on June 17.The US will host 16 group games in three venues—Florida, Texas and New York—while the rest of the tournament including the Super Eight stage, semi-finals and the final will be held in the West Indies. \nNepal will take on the United States on Thursday in their final warmup match in Dallas ahead of the 2024 ICC Men’s T20 World Cup. The Rhinos are scheduled to begin their World Cup campaign by playing against the Netherlands on June 4.On Wednesday, the Nepali squad, including nine players who attended the training session, exerted themselves at the Mustangs Cricket Academy in Dallas. The team was notably relieved by the return of Dipendra Singh Airee, whose presence is expected to significantly bolster the squad’s performance. Airee had sustained an ankle injury in St. Vincent, West Indies. His absence extended to the practice match in Houston, US, where he was unable to participate.“Airee has returned to training today and looked in good form. So he will play against the United States,” said skipper Rohit Paudel after the training.Nepal began their preparations for the 2024 ICC Men’s T20 World Cup with a heavy 63-run warm-up defeat against Canada at the Grand Prairie Stadium in Texas on Monday. “We are ready for the match against the United States. We have struggled in the batting in power plays,” said Paudel. “I am confident that we will also do well in the World Cup with these two warm up games.”Paudel stressed Nepal’s unique advantage in these warm up matches, particularly since they are taking place on the same ground where Nepal will face the Netherlands on June 4. According to him, this provides the team with a valuable opportunity to familiarise themselves with the conditions and make strategies accordingly.This will mark the United States’ first warm up game ahead of the World Cup. Their previous warm up match against Bangladesh was washed out by rain, with no single ball bowled. The United States will begin their World Cup campaign against Canada in the inaugural match of the tournament on June 1.Photos: Hemanta Shrestha \nNepal began their preparations for the 2024 ICC Men’s T20 World Cup with a heavy 63-run warm up defeat against Canada at the Grand Prairie Stadium in Texas on Monday, thanks to their batting consistencies that have come back to haunt them since the turn of the year.Last year, Nepal’s batting won the hearts of many when they pulled off a sensational comeback to win 11 out of 12 matches of the ICC Men’s Cricket World Cup League 2 and qualified for the ICC Men’s Cricket World Cup Qualifier. The Rhinos also qualified for their maiden Asia Cup and ended the year by securing their ticket to the T20 World Cup for the first time since 2014.But all that steel and resilience now seem to have suddenly vanished into the thin air.The year 2024 has been a rollercoaster ride for Rohit Paudel’s Rhinos, even in their roaring and perfect hunting ground—TU Cricket Ground, Kirtipur. They opened the League 2 with a loss against Namibia which ended their 15-match winning streak at home and won only one of their four matches of the home tri-series.They also failed to qualify for the 2025 Asia Cup last month and a four-wicket defeat to less fancied side Hong Kong in the third-place playoff of the ACC Men’s T20 Premier Cup also banished them out of the 2024 ACC Emerging Teams Asia Cup.One of their memorable moments came when they swept the three-match bilateral series against Canada in Kirtipur in their opening event of the year.However, their batting has been characterised by unsteadiness since and it was out in the open again against Canada in their first warm-up match of the T20 World Cup.Nepal’s bowling unit has been their strength always and proved key in the middle overs on Monday as well when they struck five times in the space of 27 deliveries limiting Canada from 111-2 in the 14th over to 135-7 in the 18th over, with Abinash Bohara taking 2-27, and Karan KC, Sompal Kami, Gulsan Jha, Lalit Rajbanshi and Sagar Dhakal all picking up one wicket each.Nicholas Kriton’s 50 runs off 39 balls and opener Navneet Dhaliwal’s 32 runs off 27 balls had driven Canada past 100 to give them a great start.Despite a tight bowling from Nepal, Ravinderpal Singh’s explosive 17-ball 41 guided Canada to 183-7.Nepal could never stay in the chase of an 184-run target.Opener Kushal Bhurtel and Aasif Sheikh struggled again and departed making 10 (16) and 22 (22), respectively.Skipper Paudel has been the most consistent batter for Nepal. He was Nepal’s leading run-scorer last year with 403 T20I runs from 13 innings and was facing Canada having scored 265 runs from four innings that included a century and two half-centuries—all of which came during the five-match T20 series West Indies A.He was out for a duck in his last outing—the fifth T20 against West Indies A—and failed to make a mark again after being dismissed for one.Sundeep Jora (6), Jha (0), Kami (4), Dhakal (5) and Bohara (0) all handled the bat poorly and returned to the pavilion with single digit scores, as Nepal could not only manage 120 runs.Canada’s Dilon Heyliger returned the match figures of 4-20 in this 2.3 over spell. Jeremy Gordon and Saad Bin Zafar took two wickets each while Kaleem Sana and Pragat Singh pocketed one wicket apiece.Malla and Dipendra Singh Airee also had a golden year in 2023.During the Asian Games, Malla scored a century off just 34 balls against Mongolia. The score stands as the second fastest T20I century. Malla scored 402 runs in his 12 innings last year. After struggling with the bat most of this year, he is regaining his shape gradually at a perfect time. He top-scored against Canada with 37 runs off 30 balls, carrying his form from this last match against West Indies A where he scored a valiant 37 not out off 18 balls.Airee is Nepal’s highest run-scorer in the T20Is with 1626 runs from 56 innings. He scored a 50 off just nine balls against Mongolia last year to break the record for fastest fifty in T20s. A month ago, the big-hitting finisher smashed six sixes in an over during the Premier Cup against Qatar, joining the ranks of Yuvraj Singh and Kieron Pollard in achieving the rare feat in men’s T20I. Airee did not bat against Canada.Anil Sah’s batting does not look like a bigger concern. He was outstanding again and comfortably scored 24 runs off 16 balls. He returned to the national team for Nepal’s home series against Canada in February and immediately made an impact with a fifty and an unbeaten century. Although he lost his form following the Canada series win, he has refound his confidence lately. He scored a half-century against West Indies A in what was his last inning before the Canada warm up.Nepal will face co-hosts United States in their second warm-up game on Thursday.Nepal, drawn in Group D, begin their T20 World Cup against the Netherlands on June 4 in Dallas, followed by group matches against Sri Lanka on June 12, South Africa on June 15 and Bangladesh on June 17.Nepal are making only their second appearance at a cricket World Cup—their first since World T20 in Bangladesh in 2014. \nNarendra Modi's alliance is projected for a narrow parliamentary majority, with BJP falling short of its own majority and financial markets in turmoil due to uncertainty over policy-making and governance.\nIndian stocks plummeted ~8% as vote counting shows PM Modi's BJP unlikely to win a majority, leading to market uncertainty with Nifty and BSE indices posting significant losses.\nNepal's book market is rampant with unauthorized translations of popular international works, including those by Bangladeshi-Swedish author Taslima Nasrin, despite copyright laws prohibiting such practices, compromising the quality of literature and harming authors and legitimate publishers.\nBharat Budha, chair of Putha Uttarganga Rural Municipality’s ward 10, knows that many youths from his village have made it to the United States via ‘tallo bato’—backdoor route—and that many are still on the way. He also knows that eight of them have been deported from the country and that they have lost a cumulative Rs45 million in the process. The deported youths say that they returned home empty-handed after facing unspeakable ordeals and lost Rs6 million each on average.The Tak village in Rukum East—a close-knit settlement of 425 houses—was considered the Maoists’ ‘base area’ during the insurgency. Village youths who reached the US through illegal routes and got deported have lost an estimated Rs40 million. The number of those who returned without completing the journey and the amount they lost remain unknown.To get to the US, the youths have taken loans at up to 36 percent interest per annum from their relatives and village landowners. In Tak village, at least one person each from half of the households has gone abroad, Budha said. “Youths started going to America about six-seven years ago,” he said. “If they could gather enough money, the whole village would try to go to the US.” Budha’s own son had reached the US illegally in 2017, spending Rs3.2 million.During the insurgency, outsize slogans of revolution would adorn the walls of houses in the village. Hoping for a better life, people from all walks of life helped out the Maoists. But now, village youths are paying the agents to illegally get to the US—a country that the Maoists used to call their ‘enemy’, an ‘imperialistic force’. This has cost the Tak village much and in multiple ways.Death of a dreamSome of the deported youths have chosen to flee the village altogether, burdened with debt and creditors’ pressure. At least five such families have already left, said a resident. The family of Ram Budha was one of them. On April 28, 2015, Ram, who had returned to Nepal after working in Malaysia for eight years, took the illegal route to the US. He travelled through arduous trails for months and finally arrived in the country. Upon reaching the country, he was detained and had to stay at the detention camp for 27 months. When his refugee application was rejected, he was deported to Nepal in mid-December 2019. He lost Rs4.5 million in the process. He now owes over Rs6 million to creditors. “After the creditors began to put pressure on me, I couldn’t live in the village peacefully,” said Ram, who currently runs a vegetable farm in Tarakeshwar, Kathmandu.While those who got to the US through illegal routes and fortunately got refugee status there narrate their stories with pride, those who have been deported or returned from half-way have tragic tales to tell.Nanda Kala Gharti, who lives in a small stone house on the upper flank of Tak village, spends her days in melancholy. Her husband, Dhanlal, had chosen to take the illegal route to the US, and Nanda Kala, a mother of four, is living with the repercussions of his decision. Dhanlal had got into the US after a six-month long arduous journey and was detained immediately. He had to spend four years in the detention camp, before he was deported to Nepal. He had already lost Rs6 million.Nanda Kala said they now have an insurmountable crisis in their hands. Pointing to her son, she exclaimed, “When will he grow up, go abroad and pay back the loans!”Dhanlal himself tried to go to Croatia once and spent 15 days in Kathmandu for the process. But after he was turned down, he returned home dejected. “Now we will submit the passport to another agent [for Dhanlal’s trip abroad],” Nanda Kala said. “There’s no point staying here.”Stories that echo each otherThe situation in Sisne Rural Municipality is similar to that of Putha Uttarganga. Here, one can hear plenty of stories of those who have tried to go to the US and those who are fighting refugee cases there. Krishna Regmi, chair of the rural municipality, personally knows seven people who have been deported from the US.Gangaram Khadka, a resident of Sisne-3, runs a bee and chicken farm. Like other young men in his village, Khadka had headed off to the US via an illegal route on 27 March, 2018. He had reached the US via the New Delhi-Moscow-Barcelona-Bogota-Panama-Costa Rica-Nicaragua-Honduras-Guatemala-Mexico route. When he finally arrived in the US, he was detained and had to spend 11 months in detention. He was deported on 15 March, 2019. He had handed over Rs3.2 millions to the agent and spent Rs2 million to fight the case to become a refugee. “It’s not possible for me to pay back the loan while working in Nepal,” he said. “I aim to pay back some interest and head off abroad again.”For six months after Khadka was deported, he had anxiety and headache, he said, adding the three people from his village who were deported like him are also struggling with their mental health.Tikaram Pun, a 40-year-old resident of Bohora village in Musikot-4, is also haunted by his past journey. In September 2017, he reached the US after crossing 17 countries with the help of organised human traffickers. Of the 41 people in his group, 31 were from Rukum East and Rukum West, he said. Pun, who was detained on arrival in the US, spent 24 months in a detention camp. His refugee application was also refused and so he was deported along with eight other Nepalis. “When I returned, I started having mental health problems. I still suffer from them,” he said. Pun is under pressure from creditors and relatives to pay back the Rs9.2 million loan he had taken for the task.Those who died on the wayA group of 10 Bangladeshis and seven Nepalis, including Rupak Bohora of Bafikot-3 in Rukum West, were on a mission to reach Costa Rica through Colombia, Caribbean Coast, Capuragana and Panama. But while they were crossing a sea, their boat capsized. As many as 12 died in the incident, including six Nepalis. Rupak’s wife, Geeta, learned about the incident only after six days, on 25 June, 2021.“I still don’t know what exactly happened,” said Geeta, who had been married off at age 19 and is now a mother of two daughters. The only thing she knows is that Rupak has died and she is now all alone. And that she has Rs5 million in loan taken for Rupak’s trip. She showed a picture of her husband on her phone to this scribe and said, “I only have memories.”Lack of political will and legal remediesThe concrete bridge over Chewang river is on the edge of Tak village. On the walls of the bridge are paintings of political theorists like Marx, Engels, Lenin, Stalin and Mao, and the iconic slogan, ‘Workers of the world, unite!’, below them. But the slogan appears to be at odds with life in the village. Given the phenomenon of illegal travels to the US through the help of organised human traffickers, the whole village appears to be emptying. Neither the local governments are concerned about the phenomenon nor are the political parties paying attention.Puniraj Gharti, chair of Putha Uttarganga Rural Municipality, said though the trend is worrying, there’s nothing he can do. “How could we stop them from making the trip when they are struggling to make a living in the village?” he said.Krishna Regmi, chair of Sisne Rural Municipality, said that the vicious cycle of poverty started after marijuana farming was banned in the country. Then the Maoist insurgency added to the woe, forcing youths to migrate. The signing of the peace agreement in 2006 didn’t herald any change in the economy either and youths are struggling to get jobs. Organised human traffickers are cashing in on this sorry state of affairs, Regmi said. “Meter byajis [usurious lenders] are also promoting this phenomenon,” he added.The phenomenon is equally rife in Dang’s Tulsipur and Ghorahi. Ramesh Kumar Pandey, chair of Ghorai-15, says that even though many heading to the US are swindled, no complaints are filed at the ward office. “Only those who attempt to go to Saudi Arabia or Qatar file the complaints,” he said.One can infer from Pandey’s statements that the families of such illegal travellers don’t want to publicise the ordeals of their family members. On the one hand, agents threaten them to not publicise the issue; on the other, they fear they themselves would be punished by law.According to the Anti-Human Trafficking Bureau, as many as 178 Nepalis, including 174 men, have been deported from the US in the five fiscal years after 2018-19. Of them, the highest 49 are from Rukum while 37 are from Dang. The data doesn’t include those who returned after making it to the half-way or those who have been fighting the legal battle in the US for refugee status. But this data is enough to show that many such youths are from the ‘base areas’ of the Maoist insurgency.SSP Jeevan Shrestha, chief of the bureau, said that data on the number of such victims and the amounts they have spent is hard to collect since complaints are rarely filed with the police. “This is human trafficking but for a lack of law, we are still compelled to launch the cases as per Human Trafficking and Transportation (Control) Act 2074 BS,” Shrestha said. “The Act provides a maximum penalty of Rs250,000 for the offenders and 50 percent of that as compensation to the victims.” Without specific law, police also invoke the theft and organised crime act to punish the offenders, he added.On the one hand, police receive no complaints; on the other, the phenomenon sees no control.Bhaskar Gautam, a political scientist, says the rise in cases of human trafficking in the insurgency’s ‘base areas’ is due to the political system’s abject failure.While the Maoists raised issues related to livelihood, nationalism and a new kind of democracy to fuel their war machine, after the peace process, it is livelihoods that have been hit the hardest, Gautam said. “The traditional way of life and economy took a hit during the insurgency,” he said. “Developments after the peace process also failed to address that. What sprang up was organised human trafficking.”(Mahesh KC in Rukum East and Durgalal KC in Dang contributed to this report.)This report is prepared in collaboration with the Center for Investigative Journalism-Nepal. \nGyanumaya BK, a 69-year-old laborer, is stuck paying debts due to excessive medical expenses despite hospitals being mandated to provide free treatment to the underprivileged, which most private hospitals in Pokhara, Chitwan, Biratnagar, and Butwal disregard due to lax monitoring by regulatory bodies.\nNepal's FY2024-25 budget acknowledges economic challenges but lacks credible solutions, resulting in a huge deficit and limited transformative project funding.\nWhile Ireland, Norway, and Spain recently recognized Palestine with pre-1967 borders, Nepal has already recognized Palestine in 1988 and has not revoked its recognition.\nPatriarchal male political figures have repeatedly marginalized strong, independent women in politics, silencing their voices and undermining their leadership abilities.\nNepal faces a public health crisis with the continued availability of tainted Indian spices, despite a ban, exposing consumers to cancer-causing ethylene oxide and raising concerns about the lack of food safety regulations.\nAmidst opposition pressure and media scrutiny, a parliamentary committee has been formed to investigate allegations of cooperative fraud against Home Minister Rabi Lamichhane, excluding his name despite being central to the case.\nKailash Sirohiya, arrested for alleged document forgery, is released after 9 days, exposing a crisis in civic engagement due to fears of silencing critical voices and democratic backsliding.\nLawmaker Jivan Pariyar, a joint general secretary of the Nepali Congress, the main opposition, was a member of the four-member taskforce that prepared the terms of reference (ToR) of the parliamentary committee to probe the cooperative scam. The taskforce finalised it after a prolonged dispute over whether to categorically mention Deputy Prime Minister and Home Minister Rabi Lamichhane’s name while defining the committee’s jurisdiction. The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal talked to him about the ToR finalisation process and other aspects of the probe. It took weeks to finalise the ToR and jurisdiction of the parliamentary committee formed to probe the cooperative scam. How did you finally reach an agreement? I will give a brief context first. Cases of cooperative frauds had been made public even in the past. But this time, some groups and gangs were seen to be working in an organised way to embezzle billions of rupees deposited by common people. Some established people, including those active in politics, were found to be misusing the people’s hard-earned money. This issue was thus urgent and our party Nepali Congress raised it strongly in Parliament. We had raised this issue even when we were in the government [before March 4]. We had raised it with erstwhile home minister Narayankaji Shrestha in parliamentary committees and other platforms. We had talked to him about the involvement of lawmakers and other politicians in such scams.But the Congress raised this issue more strongly after the party quit the government.This is true, and for a good reason. We demanded a parliamentary committee to probe this issue after our party’s exit from the government because Rabi Lamichhane, someone linked with some big cooperative scams, became home minister. We raised this issue after he was allowed to lead the same ministry and police agencies that were supposed to be investigating the scams. Earlier, various agencies within Nepal Police and other government bodies were looking into the matter. Erstwhile home minister Shrestha had assured us of an independent and fair investigation. Lamichhane transferred police officials who were investigating the scams, and tried to protect cooperative operators involved in wrongdoing. Based on all these activities, we concluded that a parliamentary probe committee is a must and we firmly stood for the same. Initially, we raised this issue in Parliament without obstructing House proceedings but the government compelled us to disrupt the meetings after it refused to address our concerns. The prime minister tried to give Lamichhane a clean chit by saying that he was not involved in the cooperative scams. Also, the Nepal Police chief at a parliamentary committee meeting said that the home minister wasn’t under investigation as he had done nothing wrong. In the meantime, the attorney general issued a letter stating that no cooperative-related case was registered against Lamichhane. It became clear that the government agencies wouldn’t investigate the issue independently. Then, we raised the issue strongly and we even had to obstruct Parliament meetings. After the pressure, top leaders from the ruling as well as opposition parties agreed to form a parliamentary committee to investigate the matter. The leaders formed a task force led by Law, Justice and Parliamentary Affairs Minister Padam Giri and entrusted us with preparing the committee’s ToR and defining its jurisdiction.But at the task force meetings, members from the ruling parties lobbied to define the committee’s jurisdiction in a way that only allowed for investigation into the wrongdoings of cooperatives and their operators but not those involved in syphoning money from there through illegal means. They argued that only those who issued the loans should be made liable, not those who obtained it. Their intent was to protect Rabi Lamichhane. But I insisted that our duty is to find where the common people’s money has been spent or misused and then to return the money to the depositors. I insisted on investigating Lamichhane as various studies have shown his involvement in the misuse of depositors’ money.Then, we started exchanging written proposals. We exchanged and discussed many such proposals in writing. We insisted on mentioning the names of Lamichhane and the Gorkha Media Network—where Lamichhane and GB Rai invested tens of millions of cooperatives’ money—and ensuring that the depositors get their money back. After a long negotiation, members from the UML became a bit flexible. But the Rastriya Swatantra Party of Lamichhane continued to be rigid. Then, we finally agreed to mention the names of the cooperatives from where Lamichhane and his former colleagues had obtained money and to name Gorkha Media Network but not Lamichhane.But won’t keeping out the name of the sitting home minister create more confusion and disputes?There is no need to be confused. The ToR has stated the name of Gorkha Media Network, where Lamichhane and his team invested the money they got from the cooperatives, and the ToR’s Annex-2 has a list of cooperatives from where they obtained the money. It has also stated that “responsible officials of the company” involved in such transactions would also be investigated. Even other firms and individuals linked to the transactions will be probed. So there is no chance of keeping Lamichhane away from investigation. The committee’s jurisdiction defined in the ToR is clear on this.Will your party ask for Lamichhane’s resignation after the committee starts investigating him?Our party is yet to formally demand the home minister’s resignation. But questions have been raised about him in Parliament, in various public platforms and in the media. Also, the general public has raised this issue. He knows the committee will summon him for interrogation. A few months ago, when a minister [from Congress] was summoned by the Commission for Investigation of Abuse of Authority, Lamichhane was the one who strongly demanded the minister’s resignation in Parliament. He will soon face the parliamentary inquiry committee. Let’s see how he faces it. Leaders from ruling parties including the prime minister have accused the Congress of personally targeting Lamichhane after he refused to join a Congress-led coalition in which he was offered the prime ministerial position.Leaders from new parties should understand that political leaders engage in dialogue with all political forces. Some meetings are convened in a strategic way. This is natural in a democracy. Also, Lamichhane met with our party president. But they spread a rumour that our party president offered him the prime ministerial position. That’s not true. The argument that we targeted him after he refused to join our coalition is baseless. The Congress has officially decided that the probe committee can investigate any of our members suspected of wrongdoings. Has any other party made such a decision officially? We have also officially challenged the home minister to prove the allegations he labelled at our party leaders from Parliament’s rostrum. We have also challenged him to investigate and prove the charges.When the names of head and members of the parliamentary probe committee became public, many thought that the parties didn’t give due importance to the panel as they nominated relatively low-profile lawmakers. Why didn’t the parties choose powerful leaders to investigate a national crisis of this magnitude?This is a wrong perception. All members are federal parliamentarians. They shouldn’t be judged based on their personalities and profiles. The committee is powerful because it has a mandate from the House, and its jurisdiction and the ToR give it power. What we should carefully follow is their work. They can invite experts and specialists—such as chartered accountants, bankers, account specialists—if they require technical expertise during the investigation.Lamichhane himself is chair of the fourth-largest party, which has a decisive role in the ruling coalition. Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal and CPN-UML chair KP Sharma Oli had initially ruled out any need of investigation into the home minister. In this context, can the committee members freely conduct the investigation?I am confident that even the committee member from the RSP can’t defend his leader when the documents and facts show that the money was illegally released. How can other members protect him? I believe they will conduct the investigation independently and come up with a consensus report. Documents, facts and figures guide investigation. This isn’t like leaders giving statements on public platforms. We are not saying he must be proven guilty as the Congress has blamed him. He may prove to be innocent after investigation. We should accept if the evidence proves Lamichhane innocent. The bottom line is that the investigation should be fair. Many Congress leaders are also involved in cooperative scams and other corruption cases. So people suspect that leaders will eventually trade off and the probe panel will be only an eyewash.This investigation cannot be weakened under any pretext. I am saying this based on the documents and evidence I have studied. Also, the media and other stakeholders such as the study report of Pokhara Metropolitan City and the investigation report of Rupandehi District Police, among others, have already made ample evidence public. It’s not easy to acquit the guilty.What will Congress’ approach be if the committee, where ruling parties have a majority, fails to decide by consensus and members take decisions on a majority basis?In the seven-member panel, there are two members from our party and one from the Rastriya Prajatantra Party. If those from the ruling parties pushed for a wrong decision based on their majority, members from opposition parties will counter that and register their differing views. If such a situation arises they will be free to make the reality public and they can even bring out a different report.Was Congress under pressure to reach an agreement as there were reports that the government was preparing to unveil the budget through ordinance citing opposition’s House obstruction?We weren’t worried about that.
