Write it in the form of inspiring story not news article or event.\n    \n    Story:\nOnce upon a time, nestled between the towering peaks of the Himalayas and the lush jungles of the Terai, there was a country named Nepal. Though still a developing nation, Nepal was a land of profound beauty and deep-rooted cultural heritage. The residents of Nepal faced many challenges, but beneath these hardships lay a resilient spirit and an unyielding hope for the future.\n\nThis enchanting land, where Mount Everest reaches towards the skies and the air carries a mix of incense and cool mountain breezes, was more than a geographical marvel. It was a mosaic of cultures, languages, and traditions, a testament to human endeavor against all odds. Nepal's history, from the unification under King Prithvi Narayan Shah to its transformation into a federal democratic republic, told a story of aspiration and endurance.\n\nIn recent years, the people of Nepal, with their indomitable will, had taken strides towards rebuilding and reimagining their country. They turned their struggles into stepping stones, each challenge a chapter in their ongoing saga. The shift from a monarchy to a republic had not only changed governance but had woven a new tapestry of democratic values and collective decision-making.\n\nEconomically, while agriculture continued to sustain a large part of its population, Nepal had begun to harness the potential of its picturesque landscapes, developing sustainable tourism that promised to preserve their natural heritage while boosting local economies. Communities living in the shadows of the Himalayas had become stewards of the earth, protecting the biodiversity that made their country unique.\n\nEach day brought new stories. Whether it was a festival in Kathmandu, a technological advance in Pokhara, or a conservation effort in Chitwan, these events were threads in the vibrant quilt of Nepali life. These stories, updated daily, reflected the pulse of progress and the spirit of hope that characterized this resilient nation.\n\nAnd so, as Nepal moved forward, each moment was not just a passage of time but a promise of potential, a narrative of a nation perennially climbing towards tomorrow, guided by the legacy of its past and the dreams of its future.\n\nNews events:\nNepal’s foreign direct investment commitment declined by 4.54 percent in the first four months of the current fiscal year until mid-November. The country’s power struggle continues to dampen investment and development for the country aspiring to graduate from the ranks of least developed countries in 2026.According to UN Trade and Development (UNCTAD), the UN institution dealing with trade and development globally, the decrease was primarily due to rising geopolitical tensions and concerns over “greenwashing”, a marketing practice to make things seem more environmentally friendly than they actually are.In Nepal, insiders say, an unstable political system that results in instability in critical policies is the main reason behind low FDI. Fitch, a credit ratings agency, concurs. According to the Department of Industry statistics, Nepal received investment pledges for Rs17.64 billion in 163 projects in the review period, which promises to generate employment for 8,180 people.“Recently, Nepal got a country credit rating of BB-, and everyone seems happy. But Nepal got BB- in non-investment grade, which means the country is not investment friendly and nor has there been an improvement in its business climate,” said Nara Bahadur Thapa, former executive director of the Nepal Rastra Bank.On November 21, Fitch Ratings assigned Nepal a long-term foreign-currency Issuer Default Rating (IDR) of 'BB-' with a stable outlook. The ratings reflect Nepal’s low and highly concessional government and external debt burdens, strong external liquidity and solid growth prospects underpinned by the hydropower sector.“Nepal got the BB- rating only because the foreign exchange reserve is in surplus, which will help in the repatriation of profit of foreign investors,” said Thapa.According to Fitch’s rating action commentary, Nepal has little external borrowing outside the public sector, reflecting its minimal foreign direct investment and limited integration into the global financial system. It said that burdensome procedures on profit repatriation and other regulations on external transactions have historically significantly constrained FDI inflows—but the authorities are addressing this.Fitch said frequent leadership changes in Nepal, eight changes of government since the beginning of 2014, with recurrent power struggles and shifting political alliances, have been undermining long-term policymaking and development planning.It warns that medium-term growth prospects weakened materially, for example, due to challenges in implementing development projects amid political instability, which could lead to negative rating action or downgrade.But there is a silver lining. Stable economic growth enables substantial increases in GDP per capita, potentially supported by improved governance standards and regulations conducive to private and foreign investments.“The country ceiling for Nepal is 'BB-', in line with the Long-Term Foreign-Currency IDR. This reflects no material constraints and incentives, relative to the IDR, against capital or exchange controls being imposed that would prevent or significantly impede the private sector from converting local currency into foreign currency and transferring the proceeds to non-resident creditors to service debt payments,” according to Fitch.“With a BB- rating, a narrative has been set that now is a good time to invest. But under this category, foreign investors will struggle here,” said Thapa.There are two grades in sovereign country rating. One is investment grade, and another is non-investment grade.A high-level economic reform committee has been formed, and it needs to look into improving the indicators listed for ease of doing business and gaining a BB status, said Thapa.In the first four months of the current fiscal year, investment commitments have mainly come for small-scale industries.The department received investment commitments of Rs13.17 billion for 159 projects, Rs275 million for a medium-scale project and Rs4.20 billion for three large-scale projects.The highest FDI commitment has come in the tourism sector, amounting to Rs11.58 billion for 119 projects.Similarly, Rs3.90 billion has been pledged for 21 service sector projects, Rs1.36 billion for 14 manufacturing projects, Rs600 million for three agro and forestry projects, and Rs174 million for five information and communication-based sector projects.The country received a commitment of Rs20 million for one mineral project.In the review period, the industry department recommended business visas for 900 investors, their 153 representatives, and 295 dependents.According to Nepal Rastra Bank, the country received net foreign direct investment of Rs4.81 billion in the first three months of the current fiscal year, which ended in mid-October.There is a significant gap between approved FDI and actual net FDI inflows into Nepal.Investment summits are held, and pledges made but they are not realised.Nepal needs to improve in 10 indicators of Doing Business, which used to be published by the World Bank but have now been discontinued.“There is a huge problem with tax payment in Nepal; it is filled with hassles. There are problems with company registration. There is no improvement in getting electricity and bank loans as there is no project loan service and a huge problem in repatriation. There have been no improvements on these indicators,” said Thapa.India tried to improve the FDI climate in line with Doing Business indicators, including an economy survey and budget. However, Nepal has not chosen a path for improvement.In the last fiscal year alone, only 13.57 percent of the committed Rs61.90 billion was realised, with actual foreign investment amounting to Rs8.40 billion.According to a report of Nepal Rastra Bank, between fiscal year 2014-15 and the last fiscal year, although substantial foreign investment commitments were made, a significant portion failed to enter the country.The trend shows that while foreign investment commitments have been increasing, the inflow of funds remains relatively low. Industry experts point out that no regulatory requirement mandates that all committed investments must be realised within the same fiscal period.The report said that the government allows investors to bring in funds in phases, contributing to the gap between commitment and realisation.During the third edition of the Nepal Investment Summit, which was held on April 28, the Department of Industry launched an automated route allowing foreign investors in Nepal to invest in sectors without requiring prior approval from other government authorities. The government adopted more flexible policies starting in fiscal year 2022–23 to address the shrinking FDI inflows. The minimum threshold for FDI was reduced from Rs50 million to Rs20 million in the fiscal year 2023-24. Additionally, new plans were announced to review sector-specific minimum investment requirements.The budget also mentions removing investment limits for the information technology sector, although the specifics are yet to be finalised, the central bank report said.But there is no improvement in the FDI flow.In the fiscal year 2021-22, a commitment of Rs54.15 billion was made for 295 industries, but the net FDI inflow was just Rs18.56 billion. \nThe first thing Nirmala Shakya’s and Jeroen Van den Bergh’s son did after he was born—besides drinking, sleeping and pooping—was break Nepali immigration law. “The fine we had to pay wasn’t a lot—that is not the problem,” Shakya says. “It is more the ridiculousness of it that gets to me.”Across the table from them, Bhagwati Bista giggles and nods. While Shakya and Van den Bergh don’t have the notice for the fine anymore, Bista can confirm their story. She was also fined for giving birth to her son.In both the couples—that of Shakya and Van den Bergh, and Bista and her husband—the woman is a Nepali citizen. The man and father of the child isn’t. The Nepali state automatically assumes the citizenship of the father for a child as per article 11 (7) of the constitution. Without the possibility of dual citizenship, these babies, even though born in Nepal to a Nepali parent, need a visa to stay in the country—or could go through a process to get a naturalised citizenship but not one by descent. It took a while for them to process their passports through the embassies and then another while to get them a visa, say both mothers. During this time, their children were considered illegal immigrants.While the baby-fines were, in practice, no more than a nuisance, they stand for something bigger for these families: The insecurity of their status, the absurdity of some rules, and the inequality built into the system—as this would not have happened had the fathers and not the mothers of these children were Nepali citizens.Shakya and Bista are no longer willing to accept all of this. They have both become members of a group of Nepalis married to foreigners. The goal of the group, named ‘Family Rights’, is to improve the status of their spouses without a Nepali citizenship. “We know the question of dual citizenship is an explosive one and that is not what we are pushing for,” says Manish Oli, one of the leaders of the group. “What we want is a residence status for our families.” Such a status already exists in Nepali immigration laws; but as of today, it can only be acquired if one invests large sums of money in Nepali companies or earns large salaries, but not on the grounds of a relationship.The ambiguityMost members of Family Rights have partners staying in Nepal on a marriage visa. The status is regulated under the immigration regulations of 1994 made under the Clause 8(h) of the immigration act of 1992. The status was always somewhat ambiguous. “We never had the explicit right to work,” says Paula, an Argentine citizen who has been living in Kathmandu since 2010. “But neither did someone explicitly tell us we could not.”Deepesh Ojha, a lawyer who specialises in immigration law, also says that the law on a marriage visa itself is rather vague. “It provides the right to reside in Nepal based on the fact that you are married to a citizen of Nepal,” he says. “Furthermore, the law is not clear regarding whether this entails the right to work in Nepal.”But then suddenly some of this ambiguousness disappeared. The shift was not to the liking of the foreigners with a marriage visa. The stampAccording to existing laws, a marriage visa has to be renewed every half year. For this, both spouses have to appear at the immigration office and pay a fee. “Around 2017, they suddenly added a ‘employment prohibited’ stamp to my visa,” Jeroen Van den Bergh takes out his passport and shows a page with that stamp on it. Also Manish Oli’s wife—a Russian citizen and a doctor—received the stamp. Both of the Olis were furious. “I started knocking on government offices, asking who had decided to start putting this stamp and why,” Oli says. “Nobody could answer me.” One day in 2020, just as suddenly as it had come to the scene, the stamp disappeared.By that time, Oli’s anger had built up to a fury about the insecure status of his family. He was not about to lay that fury to rest. Through social media he found out that Lopsang Nepali and Karma Tamang—both of them married to foreigners—had done largely the same—knock on authorities’ doors to get the stamp removed. Nepali had also started to collect signatures on a petition. The three got together and founded Family Rights in November 2023. The group currently has 303 members. In total, according to the group’s data, there are 1,400 families affected. The group has collected 124 signatures on their petition for a residence status for their spouses. Such a status, known to many countries, does not give citizenship or a right to vote. But it provides a certain degree of security.This security is what they crave, say the group members. Because while the circumstance that the spouses are not explicitly allowed to work is a problem, there are more severe ones. Many spouses work anyways. “You depend on the employer to take the risk, which is not great obviously,” says Paula, the Argentinian. But there are more issues.Who may stay?The foreign spouses are treated by the state like tourists in most respects: They pay tourist fares on flights and at hospitals, they cannot officially work, and they cannot own immovable property. But in one respect, they are treated even worse than tourists: The right of the foreigner to stay in the country is fully dependent on their spouse. Therefore, the most substantial problems appear in case the marriage ends—that is if either the Nepali partner dies or they divorce. “No matter how long you have been in the country, if you are here on a marriage visa, you have to leave the country,” Oli says.Immigration lawyer Ojha says it is true that marriage visas lose their validity as soon as the parties get divorced. “The question then is whether the foreigner can qualify for a different kind of visa.” That mostly depends on the exact constellation of the family. In case of death, Ojha says, a widow can get a visa through “in-person verification” of immediate family members of the deceased husband, according to section 4.4 (4) of the Immigration Rules of 2008. No specific provisions are made for the vice-versa case of a widower whose Nepali wife has died. This is not an option for divorcees: “In that case a relationship visa through the family of the ex-husband is not possible,” says Ojha. Also having a child with a Nepali citizen is not grounds per se to be granted a visa, even if that child is a minor, as there are no specific provisions for this case in the immigration rules.“These rules tear families apart,” says Manish Oli. “And that the right to be in Nepal is so immediately tied to the husband can keep especially women trapped in abusive relationships.” Consequences can get severe when one does not leave when ordered to. After the wife of the German citizen Manfred Neumann died in 2011, his marriage visa expired. After 34 years in the country, Neumann decided to stay anyway. When caught, he was sent to jail for three years—though the Supreme Court later quashed that punishment.The money questionThere is another big problem that often awaits foreigners soon after the death of their spouse or divorce: they are not allowed to own immovable property in Nepal as the section 432 of the civil code of 2017 bars the transfer of any immovable property to foreigners without a special permission from the government. “In case of a divorce, the foreign spouse is still entitled to some of the couple's assets. They are also entitled to inherit immovable property if the partner dies,” says Ojha. There is a big hurdle to that: While section 433 of the civil code of 2017 does allow for them to receive immovable property by partition or inheritance, the foreign spouse is then not allowed to own what they received in terms of immovable property. “What happens in practice is that they get a provisional ownership certificate valid solely for the transfer process,” says Ojha. “Then they immediately have to sell the property to a Nepali buyer.”Even if the foreigner has successfully sold their share of immovable property, there can be more problems. “They are not allowed to take major sums of money abroad,” says Ojha. The foreign exchange regulation act of 2019 regulates all cases in which repatriation of assets is allowed, and it does not make any provisions for such sales proceedings. So while the foreigner might have to leave, they can’t take their belongings with them.Little understandingThe residence status the group is pushing for should be crafted in a way to solve all of this, says Manish Oli. The group furthermore wants that the law be the same for all genders. Manish Oli and Lopsang Nepali say they met with a number of politicians over the past year, trying to convince them of their cause. They say they will keep knocking on the authorities’ doors for as long as it takes.A simple solution is already in place in India: The ‘Overseas Citizenship of India’ largely gives an individual the same right as the ‘Non Residential Nepali’ status but can also be acquired while residing in India. And in India the Overseas Citizenship can be extended to spouses and kids.“I agree that the Nepali immigration law needs an overhaul,” says Ojha, the lawyer. “Immigration laws today are very restrictive. We have to accommodate for new realities with the necessary flexibility. We are falling behind other countries that have already adopted more adaptable immigration policies.”The spokesperson of the Department of Immigration said that he cannot comment on whether the current laws are fair and if they will be changed. “It is up to the parliament to make the laws. We only implement.”Nirmala Shakya, the woman who was fined for giving birth to a Dutch son, says that when she explains their cause to their friends they often get little understanding. “Many people ask us why we didn’t just move to the Netherlands, where I actually would have many rights my husband does not have here,” Shakya says. “I find that a weird question. Our life is here. This is home for both of us.” \nWater bottles are kept in the wheelchair’s front part. There are packets of Dalmoth and Kurmure beside him. Cartons of noodles steal his space meant to keep his paralysed legs. Tej Bahadur Rawal, 52, thus manages a mobile shop on his wheelchair.“I move around the Mahendranagar Buspark area in a wheelchair and make a little bit of money,” says Rawal, who has spinal cord injuries. “It helps me earn and pass the time as well.”He says he earns around Rs400 to Rs500 on an average daily by selling goods mainly to the passengers who gather at the buspark area to board vehicles.Rawal reaches the Mahendranagar Buspark area at around 7 am every day with the help of his wife, Mina Devi. They bring lunch from their rented room in Aithapur, which is near Mahendranagar Bazaar. They return home in the evening after moving around Mahendranagar Buspark area and sometimes Mahendranagar Bazaar as well. The ‘wheelchair shop’ has been quite helpful for the Rawal couple in managing their household expenses.Tej Bahadur, a permanent resident of Amargadhi Municipality-6 of Dadeldhura district, was injured in People’s Movement-II, which was launched in 2006 to end king Gyanendra Shah’s direct rule and establish Loktantra. He sustained spinal cord injuries as security personnel had severely thrashed him during the peaceful movement in Dadeldhura.It was April 10, 2006. The uprising was at its peak. He joined the mass protest after taking his morning meal. Police personnel resorted to baton charges. He could not run away. The security personnel thrashed him so brutally that his spinal cord got broken.“I frequented Bareli to Delhi and Kathmandu. Big amounts of money were spent for the treatment. Neither I could save money nor was my treatment possible. My life was ruined,” says Tej Bahadur, informing that the government had provided Rs 450,000 for his treatment but he spent more mounts in a bid to get treatment.Tej Bahadur owned a bus. He used to drive his bus before his injuries and lived a decent life. “But things have changed now. Now I have to struggle to manage two squares of meals and the educational expenses of the children,” he says with a sigh.The Rawal couple has five children—three daughters and two sons. Two daughters are already married. Their youngest daughter has completed the Junior Technical Assistant course and currently stays at home. Tej Bahadur says he does not have money for her further studies. His eldest son quit studies when he was in grade 12 due to lack of money. He is working now as a daily wage earner. His youngest son is currently studying at bachelor level in Sudurpaschim University.“I have a large family. A huge amount of money is required to manage food,” Tej Bahadur says. “The government provides a monthly allowance but it is not enough to manage family expenses. We are staying on rent. The allowance is spent to pay rent.”Tej Bahadur receives a monthly allowance of Rs18,000. The federal government provides allowances to the injured victims of people’s movements as per their situation.Tej Bahadur frequently reached a general store near his residence to buy essentials. One day, the general store’s owner suggested selling goods on his wheelchair. Tej Bahadur took his suggestion positively and started selling goods in the Mahendranagar Buspark area. “I initially thought about how much I could earn money by selling water,” he recalls. “I started earning a little amount after some time.”It is all possible for Tej Bahadur due to his wife’s support, he says. Mina Devi takes him to the Buspark area and accompanies him in the business. She also supports Tej Bahadur by bringing goods from the general store. “We are doing it to eke out a living,” Meena Devi says. \nAmid a decline in temperatures, the number of people suffering from influenza and other respiratory ailments has risen. Hospitals treating respiratory patients say there has been an increase in flu and other respiratory illnesses compared to a few days ago.“A rise in cases of respiratory illnesses during winter or at the time of season change is not uncommon,” said Dr Ram Hari Chapagain, a senior consultant paediatrician at the Kanti Children’s Hospital. “Parents should not take these problems lightly, as children can sometimes develop severe symptoms.”Seasonal influenza is also highly contagious. It mainly affects the lungs and spreads quickly in communities. Its symptoms include fever, cough, body aches, and in some cases, vomiting and diarrhoea, and pneumonia.Pneumonia, an infection of the lungs caused by various types of bacteria, viruses and fungi, is the leading cause of death among children under five in Nepal. It kills more children annually than malaria, tuberculosis and HIV combined. According to the World Health Organisation, pneumonia accounts for 15 percent of under-five mortality.Doctors say pneumonia caused by bacteria is deadlier than that caused by viruses, and children under five and people above 65 years of age are highly vulnerable to the disease.Thousands of people across the country contract pneumonia every year. The average cost of hospitalisation for pneumonia is Rs13,250, which is nearly half the average monthly household expenses in Nepal, a study by Pneumo Nepal shows.The study—which was carried out at Patan Hospital, Kanti Children's Hospital, Mission Hospital in Palpa, Bheri Hospital in Nepalgunj, and BP Koirala Institute of Health Sciences—shows that unexpected medical costs often push families into poverty.Doctors warn that if seasonal influenza is left untreated, it can cause pneumonia, which can be fatal. Doctors say seasonal influenza affects not only children but also comorbid and elderly people equally.Although Nepal has no system in place to track influenza infections, severity, and deaths from influenza viruses, many people get severe infection from the disease, according to them.“We don’t know exactly how many people get infected, develop severe symptoms, or succumb to seasonal influenza each year in Nepal, as we do not maintain detailed records,” said Dr Anup Subedee, an infectious disease expert. “But the fact is small children, elderly people and those with underlying conditions are highly vulnerable.”Experts say most children recover within a few days of infection, but the virus could be severe to elderly people and those with underlying conditions.“The number of people suffering from seasonal flu, or influenza, has risen of late,” said Dr Sher Bahadur Pun, chief of the Clinical Research Unit at Sukraraj Tropical and Infectious Disease Hospital. “The increased flow of patients at pharmacies also indicates a rise in influenza cases.”Doctors say the number of people infected with seasonal influenza could be far more than recorded, as not all cases reach hospitals and undergo testing. Sometimes, even doctors do not think it necessary to carry out testing as there is no specific treatment for the infection.The seasonal influenza virus causes respiratory complications, mainly affecting the lungs. Experts say early diagnosis is crucial for preventing infection and complications. Patients recover early if treated promptly. However, the severity of the disease and deaths increase if seasonal influenza cases are not diagnosed on time.“Those who can afford to pay for influenza shots should get inoculated themselves along with children, elderly and people with comorbidities,” said Pun. “The influenza vaccine prevents severe infections.” \nToran Bikram Shahi extended the lead to three strokes after the second round of the Surya Nepal Central Open, the first event under Surya Nepal Golf Tour 2024-25, at the par-72 Gokarna Golf Club on Tuesday.Shahi carded second consecutive 5-under 67 for 36-hole total score of 10-under 134. He is three strokes ahead of second-placed Sunil KC, who carded 3-under 69 for a total score of 7-under 137. Nepal number one pro Bhuvan Nagarkoti slipped to third at 6-under 138 after he played 2-under 70.Amateur Rahul BK climbed to fourth overall at 5-under 139. He carded 3-under 69 and is four strokes ahead of Sadbhav Acharya in amateur section. Defending champion Acharya carded 3-under 69 to move up to second and sixth overall. Dharan pro Niraj Tamang is fifth overall at 3-under 141 after he carded 3-under 69 in the second round.Rajendra Thapa Magar (72) is seventh at even-par 144, while Jayram Shrestha (72) and amateur Vijay Shrestha Einhaus (72) are tied for eighth at 1-over 145. Bhuwan Kumar Rokka is at the 10th position with the total score of 2-over 146 after he played 3-over 75.A total of 27 golfers—21 pros and six amateurs—made it to the final two rounds after a cut fell at 13-over 157.Former top pro Rabi Khakda, Pradip Kumar Lama, Rajendra Shrestha Pradhan, Krishna Man Rajbahak, Deepak Magar, Dinesh Prajapati, Dhana Bahadur Thapa, Sanjay Lama, Ramesh Adhikari, Tanka Bahadur Karki, Surya Prasad Sharma, Ram Krishna Shrestha, Kumar Kami and Kishan Kaliraj Sunar survived the cut. In the amateur section, Surendra Phuyal, Gajendra Gurung and Shivaram Poudel are the other three players who made the cut.Leader Shahi took the turn at 3-under 33 and carded 2-under 34 on the back nine. He started off with a birdie on the first hole and added two more on the fifth and eighth holes on the bogey-free front nine. On the back nine, Shahi carded four birdies on the 11th, 12th, 13th and 16th holes but he also faced two bogeys on the 10th and 15th holes.KC carded 2-under 34 on the front nine and played a bogey-free 1-under 35 on the back nine. He dropped a shot on the third hole before carding birdies on the fourth, eighth and ninth holes. KC then carded a birdie on the 15th hole and saved pars on eight holes.Nagarkoti carded birdies on the third and seventh holes to take the turn at a bogey-free 2-under 34. He played even-par 36 on the back nine after he mixed three birdies with as many bogeys. He dropped shots on the 11th, 14th and 15th holes against birdies on the 12th, 16th and 17th holes.Amateur section leader BK carded bogey-free 3-under 33 on the front nine with the help of birdies on the third, seventh and eighth holes. He carded three more birdies on the 12th, 16th and 18th holes but was undone with a double bogey on the 14th and a bogey on the next hole. Defending champion Acharya took the turn at 3-under 33 and played even-par 36 on the back nine.The season-opening tournament of the Surya Nepal Golf Tour 2024-25 carries a cash purse of Rs882,000. Top three pros will receive Rs150,000, Rs100,000 and Rs75,000, respectively, while other pros in top 21 will get their share of cash prizes. \nAmid sluggish progress in law promulgation, the Legislation Management Committee of the National Assembly has decided to conduct a detailed study of the laws needed for the full-fledged implementation of the constitution promulgated around a decade ago.The committee has formed a five-member sub-committee led by Beduram Bhusal, a CPN (Unified Socialist) lawmaker to assess the progress made in law promulgation and also find out how many laws, and from which sector, still need to be enacted. The sub-committee has been given a month for the study and submit a report.The committee, after a similar study last year, had found that only 111 laws among the 151 required to implement the 2015 constitution had been enacted by July 2023. It had pointed out that 40 Acts needed either major amendments or replacement to bring them in sync with the constitution.Appearing before the upper house, then prime minister, Pushpa Kamal Dahal, had said the government was serious towards drafting the necessary bills and registering them in the federal parliament. But his government failed to walk the talk. The incumbent government too has not made serious attempts to introduce these necessary bills.“The sub-committee will study what progress has been made since last year,” said Tulasa Kumari Dahal, chairperson of the House committee. “It will study minutely as to which ministry needs which laws to implement the constitution.”Once the Bhusal-led panel submits its report, the House committee will hold discussion with the prime minister and relevant ministers. “We will try to seek explanations for the delay and instruct the government to expedite the preparations of the necessary bills,” she said.The constitution had set two deadlines to prepare laws for its implementation. It mandated the passage of laws related to fundamental rights within three years of the charter’s promulgation. The federal parliament endorsed the bills related to 31 fundamental rights a day before the constitutional deadline of September 19, 2018.As per the statute, the Acts that contradict the constitution must have been revised within a year since the first meeting of the federal parliament on March 5, 2018. Though several laws were enacted, dozens are still waiting for parliamentary approval.One major constitutional mandate involves devolving authority to manage school education from the federal government to local governments. However, the federal education law has yet to be enacted. Similarly, the federal civil service bill is also stuck in a parliamentary committee.Other crucial laws, including those related to health, citizenship and the authority of the President and Vice President have also not been enacted.The report says some of the laws in force date back as far back as 1953. Similarly, dozens of Acts are from the Panchayat era (1961-1990). For instance, the Education Act from 1972 and Infectious Disease Act from 1962 remain in force.In its report, the House committee had instructed the government to revise the Panchayat era laws to align with the present day needs. However, little progress has been made in this regard.It is the government that prepares bills and registers them in parliament. They become the Act, only after they get through both the Houses of the federal parliament and receive the Presidential seal. The government, however, solely is not responsible for the delay in having the necessary laws in place. Failure of the House committees in readying the bills to be tabled for the endorsement too is equally responsible for the delay. For instance, different House committees are sitting on 16 bills for months. Despite repetitive instructions from Speaker Devraj Ghimire, the House panels also called mini-parliaments have not been active.The upcoming winter session of the House, known as bills session, is likely to be without substantial business because neither the House committees have finalized the pending bills nor has the government registered new bills. It has been more than four months since the last bill was registered.  \nThe annual United Nations climate summit, COP29, where nations discuss the future of climate, wrapped up last Sunday in Baku, Azerbaijan. Even as nations fought hard to reach a fair deal, the conference ended with a new climate finance target or New Collective Quantified Goal (NCQG) of at least $300 billion a year by 2035. Some representatives stood from their seats and applauded; however, delegates from developing nations felt insulted and labelled the $300 billion a “paltry sum” as it is simply not enough to address their mounting climate concerns. Even though the pledge has tripled from the previous target of $100 billion, which expires at the end of this year, it is less than the $400-$900 billion that many developing countries demanded from wealthy nations. The NCQG serves as a financial tool for justice, holding developed nations accountable for a climate crisis that disproportionately affects poorer countries. Yet, the escalating climate crisis each year has not been matched by a proportional increase in climate finance to address it. According to a 2024 OECD/IEA report, only $179 billion of the $1,265 billion tracked in global climate mitigation and adaptation finance from 2021-22 went to developing nations, with just $30 billion allocated to the least developed countries (LDCs).Developing nations like ours need this fund to adapt to climate change as they progress. Climate change impacts are not equally distributed. Nepal is one of the most climate change-vulnerable countries globally, although it contributes a negligible 0.02 percent share of global carbon emissions. This means that the climate-induced disasters the nation is grappling with, like floods, droughts, heatwaves, glacial lake outburst floods (GLOF), and so on, are outcomes of global climate change, a crisis fueled mainly by the inaction of nations with substantial carbon footprints. This is the sad reality of several South Asian nations: By 2050, Bangladesh will lose 17 percent of its territory due to rising sea levels, around 90 percent of India lies in extreme heat danger zones, and Pakistan became the 5th most vulnerable country to climate change last year according to Global Climate Risk Index. Considering our susceptibility to climate change, platforms like COP are vital to inform the world about our experiences and demand the compensation we deserve. Nepal’s COP-29 priorities this year focused on safeguarding its mountains, ensuring promised climate finance, enhancing access to climate funds, and urging the expedited implementation of the loss and damage fund established last year. Under the leadership of President Ramchandra Paudel, Nepal conducted a high-level session on climate change, during which he talked about the impacts of the melting of snow in the mountains. Nepal’s participation in the previous iterations of the UN climate summit hasn’t been that impressive. Negotiating and presenting on such platforms require experience, research and preparation. More than anything, it demands sensitivity towards climate change, which our leaders seemingly do not possess. Besides setting an NCQG, this year’s COP also delivered global standards for carbon trading and mandated all 195 Paris signatories to announce more ambitious emission targets by February 2025. However, concerns over Donald Trump’s re-election as the US president overshadowed these developments at the summit. The US, even though it is the world’s second-largest emitter after China, withdrew from the Paris Agreement during Trump’s first term. Although climate finance this year did not meet the expectations of developing nations, it cannot be rejected, especially with the rise of right-wing politicians who are indifferent to the climate crisis. Regardless, Nepal must strengthen its domestic climate change policies and enhance its negotiating and communication skills internationally. It should also collaborate with other developing nations that are experiencing the negative impacts of climate change. It is time we stopped ignoring the elephant in the room.  \nThe formal implementation of federalism in Nepal began after the three-tier elections in 2017. As it completes its seventh year, the journey to effective implementation remains fraught with challenges. The recent Kantipur Conclave (November 13-14) brought together the chief ministers of all provinces to discuss the progress, hurdles and opportunities in federal governance in a session titled “Face to Face with Chief Ministers”. Their insights shed light on the practical realities of federalism, revealing gaps in legislation, administrative autonomy, fiscal federalism and intergovernmental relations.Chief ministers highlighted several shared concerns about federalism's implementation. Hikmat Karki, Chief Minister of Koshi Province, said that provinces are given a “treasure bag without money,” referring to the lack of fiscal autonomy. He pointed out that while Koshi Province has made progress, such as reforming the vehicle licensing system, it still faces significant barriers due to the absence of enabling legislation and institutional support from the federal government. Similarly, Satish Kumar Singh, Chief Minister of Madhesh Province, echoed the frustration over the gap between rights and resources. He compared Nepal’s federalism with India’s, highlighting how Indian states are empowered with resources and authority to implement their mandates. Singh called for more clarity in resource allocation and legislative framework and emphasised the need for regular evaluation and accountability for civil servants.The struggle for autonomy and functionality is not confined to these provinces. Chief Minister Bahadur Singh Lama of Bagmati Province pointed to a lack of laws governing exclusive and shared powers as a fundamental issue, despite his province achieving over 70 percent budget utilisation. Surendra Raj Pandey of Gandaki Province articulated similar concerns. He metaphorically described how federalism is stuck in a “2G framework” while governance demands have moved into a “5G era”. Pandey emphasised that the delayed enactment of critical federal laws, such as the Federal Police Act and the Education Act, prevents provinces from functioning effectively. He criticised the centralised mindset of political leaders and bureaucrats, which stymies the progress of federalisation.Acting Chief Minister Bhumeswar Dhakal of Lumbini Province stressed that provinces are the backbone of federalism and pivotal for connecting government to the people. He expressed frustration over the federal government’s failure to release grants on time and clarify shared powers. Meanwhile, Yam Lal Kandel of Karnali Province focused on the need for equitable resource allocation. He criticised the centralised governance model, arguing that it perpetuates disparities between provinces. Kandel called for timely legislation and structural alignment to enable provinces to fulfil their constitutional mandates and address development gaps.Kamala Bahadur Shah, the Chief Minister of Sudurpaschim Province, shed light on bureaucratic resistance. He shared an anecdote where a government secretary denied provincial authority but exerted control when operating in Kathmandu. According to Shah, this duality highlights the reluctance among bureaucrats to embrace federalism. He urged leaders to adopt a federal mindset and foster collaboration to strengthen governance at all levels.Despite challenges, chief ministers also shared some successes and opportunities. For example, the vehicle licensing reform in Koshi Province and Bagmati Province’s high budget utilisation demonstrate that provinces can deliver tangible results when given authority and resources. However, these isolated successes cannot mask the persisting systemic issues across provinces.At the Kantipur Conclave, their concerns were similar to those raised during programmes organised in all provincial capitals by the Federalism and Localization Centre, facilitated by the chief ministers’ offices in September 2024.Federalism is a shared responsibility, and its success depends on the collective efforts of federal, provincial and local governments. Chief ministers emphasised that the federal government must lead by example, demonstrating a commitment to federalisation and creating an enabling environment for provinces to thrive.Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli also addressed the conclave, emphasising the government's commitment to enacting laws that will provide reasonable powers to the provinces in line with the constitution. In response to concerns raised by the chief ministers regarding the lack of essential resources, such as financial autonomy and police powers, Oli acknowledged that the federal government has yet to enact laws that would fully empower the provinces. However, he assured that such laws would be made to ensure that provinces receive the rights they are entitled to.Prime Minister Oli's message, however, was not entirely encouraging for the provinces. He suggested that rather than focusing on “Sanduk ra Banduk” (fiscal resources and police authority), provinces should prioritise working with ideas and enthusiasm. Drawing on the example of Mahatma Gandhi, who achieved monumental change without weapons or fiscal resources, Oli emphasised that “thoughts” and “enthusiasm” are key to progress, suggesting that provinces should cultivate a mindset of innovation and dedication rather than waiting for more powers to be granted.While his statement reflected optimism and a call for action, it highlighted a more cautious approach toward empowering the provinces, contrasting with the urgency the provincial leaders expressed.The insights shared by the chief ministers at the conclave serve as a roadmap for strengthening federalism in Nepal. Their voices underscore the need for clear laws, robust institutions and a commitment to federalisation and inclusivity. Addressing legislative gaps, empowering provinces with resources and authority and fostering a decentralised mindset are critical steps toward realising the promise of federalism.As Nepal navigates its federal journey, these lessons must guide its path toward more effective and equitable governance. By tackling the systemic issues collectively, Nepal can fulfil the promise of federalism and build a governance system that serves its diverse population. The conclave provided a platform for these critical discussions, and it is now up to the stakeholders to act on these insights and strengthen the federal framework. Federalism in Nepal remains a work in progress, but with concerted efforts, it holds the potential to transform governance and empower provinces to become engines of development and inclusivity. \nDonald Trump, a convicted felon, an unashamed racist, an unapologetic misogynist, a habitual liar, a climate change denier, and a twice-impeached former President, returned to the White House through democratic elections, fair and square. Trump's victory shocked many, but this is not the first time a malignant personality has been elected to a high office.Hitler also rose to power through a legitimate democratic process. He convinced the German voters that the German Jews were behind the humiliation Germany suffered under the Treaty of Versailles. He blamed the Jews for collaborating with the enemies in the First World War and called them “vermin.” The strategy worked. He got elected, became a dictator, and killed an estimated 6 million Jews. Emulating Hitler, Trump blamed immigrants, particularly illegal immigrants, for all of America's woes, from crime to economy to housing to health care, and threatened to expel the estimated 11 million “illegals”. Like Hitler, the president-elect called his opponents at home “vermin”. It worked. Pundits, professors, pollsters and significant newspaper columnists, who until a day before the election were predicting a close election, are now in overdrive dissecting the unexpected result—what Harris and the Democrats did wrong that culminated in Trump's triumph and what will be the impact of the four years of the Trump administration domestically and internationally. Surprisingly, these analyses do not explore the deficiencies in the United States Constitution that enabled an unrepentant felon to rise to unchecked power. The American Constitution The US Constitution is the world's first national constitution, ratified in 1788. A product of a compromise among various warring colonies, the slave owners in the South, and antislavery citizens in the North, it was a remarkable document at the time and is still in force. However, many of its requirements are inconsistent with modern times—for example, the allocation of Senate seats. The Constitution allocates two seats to every state, regardless of population size. Thus, California, with a population of nearly 40 million, and Wyoming, with a population of about 500,000, have two seats each in the Senate, contrary to the fundamental tenet of modern democracies where population sizes determine the number of representatives. The skewed system gives the smaller states an oversized voice in the powerful Senate, a significant advantage to the Republican Party with a stronghold in these states. It was this undemocratic Senate which refused to ratify Trump's impeachment by Congress twice and bar him from future elections. The lifetime tenure of the Supreme Court judges is another serious flaw in the Constitution. Lifetime tenure was intended to insulate justices from partisan politics. “Once a justice is confirmed and takes a seat on the court, they're not beholden to anybody”. But those ideas have gone by the wayside as the President's nominations to the court have become increasingly partisan. Flags symbolising opposition to the outcome of the 2020 election, which Trump lost, have been displayed on the front grounds of a Supreme Court judge’s home; the wife of one of the judges has been found working with those conspiring to subvert the 2020 election. Conservative judges, who call themselves “originalists” (while deciding a case, they interpret the Constitution as the founders would have interpreted it), are in the majority in the Supreme Court. How they get into the heads of these 18th-century men is anyone's guess, but in most Trump-related litigations, they have decided in Trump's favour. The Supreme Court could not or would not stop a felon from contesting election to the highest office in the land, while many ordinary felons are not even allowed to vote. One recent decision of the Court was to grant the President immunity for all his actions as head of the Executive branch. Dissenting Justice Sonia Sotomayor warned that the decision would set future presidents as “a king above the law”. With control of both Houses of Congress and a Supreme Court stacked with a majority of compliant conservatives, Trump will have a near-absolute grip on all the levers of American power for at least two years until the midterm elections. The checks and balances imagined in America's 1788 Constitution will be virtually ineffective for these two years unless Congressional Republicans show some spine and rise to challenge Trump's excesses. If they don’t, Trump’s monopoly of power will continue for the entire four years of his term unless the mid-term elections change the control of the House of Congresses. If Trump does everything he has promised—and given the appointments in his administration announced to date, there is no reason to believe he won't—the United States will be in serious conflict with itself in the coming four years. Its impact will be felt worldwide, not just in economic and military matters but also culturally. Impact on NepalTrump is a highly transactional individual. He will only give something away if he gets something back in return and with a profit. Under Trump, the volume of US aid to Nepal will likely depend on the degree of Nepal's collaboration with the administration in pushing its agenda to challenge China's growing global influence. Given Trump's anti-immigrant bias, in the coming four years, the number of visas granted to Nepalis is likely to reduce significantly; there will be no Diversity Visa (DV), no family-sponsored Green Cards (Trump has consistently opposed both DV visas and family Green Cards); and naturalised Americans, like other naturalised citizens, will be under constant threat of denaturalisation for the slightest infringement of US laws. An accomplished Nepali engineer who came to the United States in 1992 told me, “There is no certainty that Trump will not resume the aggressive denaturalisation process he started in his first term”. Trump's victory will also have a significant cultural impact on future generations in the US and around the world, including Nepal. Upon confirmation of Trump's victory, my seven-year-old granddaughter quipped, “Now I can say and do anything I want”. Thinking of children growing up with such a mindset is worrying. There is no doubt Trump's behaviour over the last eight years provides a feeder to our political leaders who are unashamedly corrupt and have a penchant for personal insults and dehumanisation of their opponents. If the American President can do it, why not us? Trump's election was America's moral collapse. With control of both houses of Congress and a compliant Supreme Court, the democratic levers of change in America are now near nonexistent. Trump is virtually the only source of power, the “king above the law”. This is not good for America or the rest of the world, including Nepal.I hear the echo of my feelings about Trump's election in the words of a celebrated Canadian journalist, Andrew Cohen: “All my life, I have been an admirer of the United States and its people. But I am frightened of it now, and I am even more frightened of them”. \nKarnali Province has worryingly become synonymous with tragic road accidents, with deaths and injuries getting far too frequent. We aren’t even halfway through this fiscal year, and as many as 48 people have already died on Karnali’s roads. According to the Provincial Police Office in Surkhet, just in the second week of November, 17 accidents resulted in 12 fatalities and 132 injuries. And in the past five years, a total of 666 people in the province died for the same reason. This alarming data hints at systemic negligence and calls for immediate remedial action.Karnali’s rugged topography is well-known, presenting natural challenges to smooth transport. But the blame for these accidents cannot be attributed solely on the province’s layout. In areas with a limited number of vehicles, reckless bus operators overload them, which contributes to accidents. Recently, a five-seater jeep jam-packed with 32 people crashed at Raduneta of Palata Rural Municipality-3 in Kalikot district, killing seven and injuring 13 others. Moreover, the vehicle operators tend to deceive the police by asking some passengers to get off the bus at security check-posts so the overcrowding goes unnoticed. The passengers are left with no option but to accept such wretched conditions, often out of necessity. The vehicle operators also justify their actions by claiming they cannot bar people who want to get inside packed buses, especially on routes where public transport is scarce. Such problems could have been averted if the province had good roads and enough vehicles. The Karnali Highway was blacktopped eight years ago, but the asphalt has eroded in sections, making accidents more likely. Inaugurated in 1992 and operated in 2007, the state of the highway remains sub-par and inadequate to meet the province’s demands. Besides the Karnali Highway, Rapti, Mid-Hill Highway and other road sections also need upgrade and widening. Landslides during the monsoon obstruct these roads and pose danger to travellers. This absence of proper road infrastructure has not just affected the local people but also harmed Karnali’s tourism prospects and undercut its development aspirations. There isn’t much interest, either at the federal or provincial level, in improving the state of Karnali’s roads. The focus of elected officials seems to be to open new tracks on unstable soil just to show that development has ‘arrived’ in Karnali. The region’s challenges are examples of systemic neglect. While it is commendable that many remote areas are now connected by roads, these paths should also be relatively safe and easy to traverse. Given such a large number of deaths and injuries, the federal and provincial governments should prioritise road safety as a matter of urgency. Drivers, police and passengers—none of them can escape their responsibility while blaming the others for the accidents. They would all be better served if they joined hands to put pressure on governments to enhance the quality of roads and collaborate with the private sector to bring more vehicles to the province. Monitoring and supervision activities along the stretch of the Karnali Highway, where most accidents take place—from Bangesimal in Surkhet to Khalanga in Jumla—should be another priority. Nowhere in Nepal should people have to put their lives on the line while travelling for essential business.  \nThe Millennium Challenge Account Nepal (MCA-Nepal) has relaunched the call for bids to construct a 297-km power transmission line.The transmission line to be built under the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) Nepal Compact will strengthen Nepal’s power transmission network, the MCA Nepal said in a statement on Wednesday.The bid submission deadline is set for January 30, 2025. Construction is divided into three lots: Lapsiphedi-Ratmate-New Hetauda, Ratmate-New Damauli, and New Damauli-New Butwal. According to the MCA Nepal, the relaunch follows a comprehensive review of the previous bidding process and includes design optimisations, improved access to tower locations, and updates to commercial terms based on bidders’ feedback.These adjustments address the main cost drivers identified in the initial bids, ensuring more feasible and cost-effective proposals, it said. On August 30, the MCA-Nepal successfully awarded Transrail Lighting Ltd. a US$12.36 million contract to construct the 18-km Nepal portion of the Butwal-Gorakhpur transmission line, which will be completed within 21 months.“After securing the contract for the 18-km segment, we are confident the redesigned requirements for the remaining 297-km will attract strong market interest and competitive bids,” said Khadga Bahadur Bisht, executive director of the MCA-Nepal. The MCA Nepal said the relaunch marks another milestone in the progress of the MCC Nepal Compact, which has made significant progress over the past year.With contractors already working on the three 400kV substations and the 18-km transmission line, the MCA-Nepal is on track to implement the remaining segments, further strengthening Nepal’s energy infrastructure, it said.The MCA-Nepal is committed to the successful execution of this procurement and the transmission line construction works while meeting the environmental and social standards of both the government of Nepal and the MCC, reads the statement.The projects built under the MCC Nepal compact must be completed within five years after the compact came into force in the last week of August this year. Nepal’s Parliament ratified the much-debated MCC compact in February 2022, following an agreement in 2017 between the government and the MCC. The MCC compact signing opened the way for the United States to invest $500 million in Nepal’s power and transport infrastructure. The government of Nepal, on its part, contributes $197 million in support of the compact. \nA ceasefire between Israel and Iran-backed group Hezbollah came into effect at 0200 GMT on Wednesday after U.S. President Joe Biden said both sides accepted an agreement brokered by the United States and France.Bursts of gunfire could be heard across Beirut after the ceasefire took effect. It was not immediately clear if the shooting was celebratory, as gunfire had also been used to alert residents who may have missed evacuation warnings issued by Israel’s military.Streams of cars began heading to southern Lebanon, which borders Israel, after the ceasefire early on Wednesday, according to Reuters witnesses.The ceasefire promises to end a conflict across the Israeli-Lebanese border that has killed thousands of people since it was ignited by the Gaza war last year.Biden spoke at the White House on Tuesday shortly after Israel’s security cabinet approved the agreement in a 10-1 vote. He said he had spoken to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Lebanon’s caretaker Prime Minister Najib Mikati, and that fighting would end at 4 a.m. local time (0200 GMT).“This is designed to be a permanent cessation of hostilities,” Biden said. “What is left of Hezbollah and other terrorist organizations will not be allowed to threaten the security of Israel again.”Israel will gradually withdraw its forces over 60 days as Lebanon’s army takes control of territory near its border with Israel to ensure that Hezbollah does not rebuild its infrastructure there, Biden said.“Civilians on both sides will soon be able to safely return to their communities,” he said.Hezbollah has not formally commented on the ceasefire but senior official Hassan Fadlallah told Lebanon’s Al Jadeed TV that while it supported the extension of the Lebanese state’s authority, the group would emerge from the war stronger.“Thousands will join the resistance ... Disarming the resistance was an Israeli proposal that fell through,” said Fadlallah, who is also a member of Lebanon’s parliament.Iran, which backs Hezbollah, the Palestinian group Hamas as well as the Houthi rebels that have attacked Israel from Yemen, has not publicly commented on the ceasefire.French President Emmanuel Macron said on social-media platform X the deal was “the culmination of efforts undertaken for many months with the Israeli and Lebanese authorities, in close collaboration with the United States.”Lebanon’s Mikati issued a statement welcoming the deal. Foreign Minister Abdallah Bou Habib said the Lebanese army would have at least 5,000 troops deployed in southern Lebanon as Israeli troops withdrew.Netanyahu said he was ready to implement a ceasefire but would respond forcefully to any violation by Hezbollah.He said the ceasefire would allow Israel to focus on the threat from Iran, give the army an opportunity to rest and replenish supplies, and isolate Hamas, the Palestinian militant group that triggered war in the region when it attacked Israel from Gaza last year.‘Set it back decades’“In full coordination with the United States, we retain complete military freedom of action. Should Hezbollah violate the agreement or attempt to rearm, we will strike decisively,” Netanyahu said.Hezbollah, which is allied to Hamas, was considerably weaker than it had been at the start of the conflict, he added.“We have set it back decades, eliminated ... its top leaders, destroyed most of its rockets and missiles, neutralized thousands of fighters, and obliterated years of terror infrastructure near our border,” he said.A senior U.S. official, briefing reporters on condition of anonymity, said the U.S. and France would join a mechanism with the UNIFIL peacekeeping force that would work with Lebanon’s army to deter potential violations of the ceasefire. U.S. combat forces would not be deployed, the official said.Jon Finer, deputy national security adviser in the Biden administration, told CNN that Washington would be watching for any violations of the deal.“Implementation of this agreement will be key and we will be very vigilant to any attempts to disrupt what the two parties have committed to as part of this process today,” he said.Biden, who leaves office in January, said his administration would continue to push for an elusive ceasefire and hostage-release deal in Gaza, as well as for a deal to normalize relations between Israel and Saudi Arabia.In the hours leading up to the ceasefire, hostilities raged as Israel ramped up its campaign of airstrikes in Beirut and other parts of Lebanon, with health authorities reporting at least 18 killed.The Israeli military said it struck “components of Hezbollah’s financial management and systems” including a money-exchange office.Hezbollah also kept up rocket fire into Israel.Israel’s air force intercepted three launches from Lebanese territory, the military said, in an extensive missile barrage on Tuesday night that led to warning alarms in about 115 settlements.Alia Ibrahim, a mother of twin girls from the southern village of Qaaqaiyat al-Snawbar, who had fled nearly three months ago to Beirut, said she hoped Israeli officials, who have expressed contradictory views on a ceasefire, would be faithful to the deal.“Our village – they destroyed half of it. In these few seconds before they announced the ceasefire, they destroyed half our village,” she said. “God willing, we can go back to our homes and our land.”A poll conducted by Israel’s Channel 12 TV found that 37% of Israelis were in favour of the ceasefire, compared with 32% against.Opponents to the deal in Israel include opposition leaders and heads of towns near Israel’s border with Lebanon, who want a depopulated buffer zone on Lebanon’s side of the frontier.Both the Lebanese government and Hezbollah have insisted that a return of displaced civilians to southern Lebanon is a key tenet of the truce.Israeli Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, a right-wing member of Netanyahu’s government, said on X the agreement did not ensure the return of Israelis to their homes in the country’s north and that the Lebanese army did not have the ability to overcome Hezbollah.“In order to leave Lebanon, we must have our own security belt,” Ben-Gvir said. \nThe Meteorological Forecasting Division has said that hilly regions of Koshi, Bagmati, Gandaki, and Karnali Provinces will experience partly cloudy weather today, while the rest of the country will see mainly fair conditions.Light rain is likely in one or two places in the hilly areas of Koshi, Bagmati, and Gandaki Provinces, with chances of light snowfall in the high-altitude regions of Koshi and Gandaki.Tonight, partly cloudy weather will persist in the hilly regions of Koshi, Bagmati, and Gandaki, with light rain expected in some areas of Koshi and Gandaki.The division attributes these conditions to the influence of westerly winds.Bhairahawa recorded the highest temperature at 27.5°C on Tuesday while Jumla experienced the lowest at -4.5°C.Taplejung reported traces of rainfall, the only location with precipitation in the past 24 hours. \nThe top-performing Nepali cricketer of the Nepal Premier League (NPL) T20 cricket tournament will be rewarded with a brand new car as Omoda & Jaecoo Nepal, on Tuesday, joined the franchise league as one of the co-sponsors.Cricket Association of Nepal (CAN) Secretary Paras Khadka and Gaurav Sharda, director of SPG Automobiles Private Limited, signed a Memorandum of Understanding during a function in Kathmandu.SPG Automobiles is the authorised distributor of Omoda & Jaecoo Automobiles.“The best Nepali player of the Nepal Premier League will now get a car from Sharda Group,” Khadka said following the deal.Director Sharda said that the involvement of Omoda & Jaecoo is aimed at elevating the cricket milestone in Nepal, further adding that the partnership will aim to enhance the Nepali cricket development and contribute to leverage the cricketing scenario.-Action Sports to stream NPL on YouTube-The matches of the NPL will also be available for online viewers via the official YouTube channel of Action Sports, according to Brand Digital Logiq, a digital marketing agency in Nepal managing NPL’s commercial rights.An agreement regarding YouTube streaming rights was signed on Tuesday between Brand LogiQ and Dish Media Network.The television broadcasts will be aired live on Star Sports.The NPL is scheduled to take place from November 30 to December 16 at the TU Cricket Ground in Kirtipur. \nThe price of gold in the Nepali market has continued to decline.On Tuesday, the price of gold dropped by Rs2,600 per tola (11.664 grams) to Rs148,700, according to the Federation of Nepal Gold and Silver Dealers Association. Silver also saw a decrease, dropping by Rs25 per tola to Rs1,820. This follows a significant drop on Monday when gold prices plummeted by Rs15,900 per tola after the government cut the customs duty on gold from 20 percent to 10 percent. The price of hallmark gold was set at Rs151,300 per tola on Monday, down from Rs167,200 on Sunday. The decision to slash the duty on gold customs was made during a cabinet meeting on Thursday. This move aims to address the imbalance caused by Nepal’s higher gold duty compared to India's, which recently reduced its duty from 15 percent to 6 percent. The disparity had encouraged illegal trade through the open border. The Federation has suggested that Nepal set the customs duty at 8 percent to help curb smuggling. \nNepal secured their second consecutive win in the ongoing Blind Cricket T20 World Cup, defeating South Africa by 11 runs in a closely contested match on Tuesday.The match, part of the tournament being held in Pakistan, saw Nepal batting first and setting a challenging target of 199 runs. Nepal's Naresh Chaudhary was the standout performer, scoring a brilliant 80 runs. The team finished their innings at 198 for the loss of four wickets in 20 overs.Chasing the target, South Africa managed 187 runs for the loss of two wickets in their allotted 20 overs. Despite an unbeaten century (100 runs) by South African batsman Bule Vidhale, the team fell short of the target.This victory follows Nepal’s win against Afghanistan on Monday, after losing their first two matches against Sri Lanka and Bangladesh. With this win, Nepal’s chances of securing a spot in the semifinals have significantly improved.The tournament features six teams: Nepal, India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, and South Africa. \nDuring monsoon last year, the Chandannath Municipality of Jumla district reported several cases of dengue. The local unit has reported cases of infection from the deadly virus this year too.Although most cases were locally transmitted, health workers in the district don’t consider the virus spread a serious public health problem. This is because Jumla is among the coldest places in the country, with temperatures dipping to subzero levels in the winter.Studies, however, show a disturbing development.“My study shows the presence of Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes and their larvae in Chandannath Municipality,” said Buddhi Ram Oli, a PhD scholar at the Central Department of Zoology of the Tribhuvan University. “Chandannath Municipality is located at an elevation of 2,438 metres, and this is the first time that dengue virus-spreading mosquitoes and their larvae have been found at such a high altitude.”Earlier, vectors spreading the deadly disease were recorded only up to 2,100 metres.Local residents and health officials serving in Jumla are aware of the presence of vectors spreading deadly diseases and growing number of infections. But they don’t take the issue seriously, thinking that the vectors cannot survive long due to the climatic conditions of the region.“We once met officials at District Health Office Jumla and discussed launching an awareness drive and destroying breeding sites of mosquitoes,” said Chhatra Bahadur Mahat, health coordinator at the Chandannath Municipality. “But neither does the health office provide a budget for such programmes nor does the local unit allocate any funds. So we couldn’t do anything.”Along with Jumla, all districts across the country have recorded dengue infections this year.Oli, who carried out vector surveillance, said that, as in Chandannath Municipality, health workers at other local units too have not taken the risk of the virus-spread seriously.Experts say the country’s health workers and health facilities are ill prepared to cope with the emerging public health challenges brought about by climate change. Several health facilities were overwhelmed with dengue patients this year, too. Due to a lack of beds, patients were forced to sleep in corridors, on the floor, on chairs, in storerooms, and out in the hospital compound. Hospitals even lacked basic supplies like IV stands, and patients’ visitors had to hold the IV bags or health workers had to improvise by tying them to windows.Experts say the deadly virus outbreak in most mountain districts and all hill districts shows the impact of climate change on Nepal’s healthcare system. Despite these challenges, no effective mitigation measures have been adopted.Many hospitals are overwhelmed with an influx of patients, and health workers are forced to place seriously ill patients in corridors and other makeshift spaces, compromising patient safety.“Our health facilities are not equipped to endure the climate crisis,” said Dr Meghnath Dhimal, chief researcher at the Nepal Health Research Council. “Many are built on hilltops or riverbanks and are vulnerable to climate impacts. These health facilities are also unprepared for emerging problems and surges in patient flow.”Experts say climate change, along with some other factors, such as increased mobility and improved transportation, has been contributing to the spread of deadly diseases in places considered no-risk zones in the past.“The rise in the temperature caused by climate change provides a conducive environment for dengue vectors to thrive and spread in the mountainous areas,” said Dhimal. “Risks posed by climatic factors cannot be ignored or underestimated.”A report by the United Nations titled ‘Climate Change 2022: Impacts, Adaptation and Vulnerability’ states that at least six major vector-borne diseases have recently emerged in Nepal and are now considered endemic, with climate change implicated as the primary driver.The report also showed increasing evidence that climate change has extended the elevational distribution of Anopheles, Culex and Aedes mosquitoes, which carry viruses to above 2,000 metres in Nepal.Dengue is a viral disease transmitted by female Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes. According to the World Health Organisation, the same vector also transmits chikungunya, yellow fever, and the Zika virus.So far, 12 people have died due to dengue and over 29,000 have been infected since the start of 2024 if the government data is to be believed. Experts say reported dengue cases may only represent a small fraction of the true scale of the outbreak, as around 90 percent of the infected people do not show any symptoms and health authorities often conceal the actual number of deaths and infections.This year, districts in Tarai region reported fewer cases of dengue infection than districts in the hills and mountains. Experts attribute this to the residents of Tarai’s becoming more aware of the deadly virus and taking preventive measures. High temperatures (above 35 degrees Celsius) could also have contributed to less infection, as mosquito vectors do not survive above 35 degrees Celsius.Over the past few years, dengue has become a year-round threat in Nepal, with cases consistently on the rise. \nManufacturers and exporters say they are in a dilemma over trade with India following the restrictive measures imposed by New Delhi on Nepali goods. Making matters worse is the Nepali government’s silence even though the goods have not been sold to India for months.Dol Raj Adhikari, president of the Nepal Sanitary and Diaper Association, said sanitary pads and diapers worth of Rs250 million had been stranded in the warehouses for the past three months.“We completed all the processes to acquire the Bureau of Indian Standards [BIS] certificate to export our products, but no team from India is coming to inspect the factory. We even wrote to the Indian authority multiple times but our requests have fallen on deaf ears.”As per the provision, once the Indian inspection team gives a green signal after factory inspection, goods can be exported to India.In 2020, the Indian government asked the BIS to prescribe mandatory standards for imported goods in line with international quality norms. The move aimed to prevent Chinese goods from entering India from any of its neighbours.After the suppression of Chinese apps, the Indian government imposed import restrictions on more than 370 Chinese products. Insiders say India does not want any products from Nepal that have Chinese components, including Nepal’s hydroelectricity, greatly worrying Nepal’s top exporters.The BIS deals with the marking and certifying of goods, incorporating quality standards and information on international norms to be followed while importing.The rules worry Adhikari, who owns the AG Health Industries Private Limited that produces sanitary pads and diapers in Bhairahawa. “India seems intent to halt imports from Nepal,” said Adhikari. According to the association, Nepal used to export three truckloads of sanitary pads and diapers daily. There are 29 sanitary pads and diaper factories in Nepal, both large and small, employing 6,000 workers.Sanitary pads and diaper factories used to operate 12 hours a day when the demand boomed, but due to the export obstacles, factories have reduced operating hours by 4 hours, said Adhikari.According to the Department of Customs, Nepal exported 201.99 million pieces of sanitary pads and diapers worth Rs719 million to India in the last fiscal year, ending mid-July.Likewise, a big consignment of Goldstar shoes failed to get export clearance after India refused to issue the BIS certificate, putting Nepal’s homegrown shoemaker on the brink.Exporters said there were rumours on Friday that India had extended the deadline to obtain a BIS certificate, and the Nepali exporters were allowed to export goods with their existing certificates.“But we have not received any formal notice from the Indian authority on the time extension of the BIS certificate,” said Baburam Adhikari, spokesperson for the Ministry of Industry, Commerce and Supplies. “If the BIS had made such a decision, we would have been informed.”“Neither the BIS India nor the domestic industries has confirmed or communicated with us on the issue.”After Nepali exports were halted over the BIS issue, the industry ministry has written multiple times to its Indian counterpart. Meetings were held, and the issue was forwarded even during Industry Minister Damodar Bhandari’s visit to India in August. “However, there is no progress,” said Adhikari. Adhikari said none of the Nepali exporters who applied for the BIS certificate have gotten it till now.“The BIS certificate issue has put the industries in Rupandehi in a big dilemma. They were opened to export goods to India,” said Thakur Kumar Shrestha, president of the Siddhartha Chamber of Commerce and Industry. It has negatively impacted both the industries and Nepal’s trade.Shrestha said factories are either running at half capacity or getting shut down, and workers are being laid off. Exports from the cement makers in Rupandehi—such as Arghakhanchi Cement, Sarbottam Cement, Palpa Cement, and Balaji Cement—have completely stopped for nearly two months.“Even as the domestic consumption of cement declined, production was not impacted due to the huge demand from India. But now cement plants in Rupandehi are on the verge of shutting down or running under-capacity,” said Shrestha.Except plywood, the export of all the listed goods that require a BIS certificate has come to a halt, said Shrestha. “India has neither renewed the certificate nor provided a new one.”Goods under the BIS with compulsory certification are any variety of cement manufactured or sold in India, steel and iron products, chemicals, fertiliser, polymers and textiles, cables, flat transparent sheet glass, cattle feed, footwear, centrifugally cast (spun) iron pipes, jute bags, viscose staple fibres, geo textiles, portable water bottles, plywood, and wooden flush door shutters, among others.“Plywood is currently not restricted. But despite having already paid the BIS charges and completed the process, the inspection team from India has not provided a BIS certificate for Nepali goods,” said Hom Prasad Ghimire, president of the Nepal Plywood Manufacturers Association. Ghimire said that his company completed the process of getting the BIS certificate in June. He said the Nepali plywood is of better quality than the Indian plywood.Plywood has been given until March 2025 for certification-free export. He said that out of 80 plywood factories, 52 have even deposited charges to obtain the certificate. The plywood industry employs 25,000 workers across the country.According to the association, Nepal exported Rs8 billion worth of plywood to India. The volume could have increased had the exports not been interrupted.Trade with India has been repeatedly obstructed. Experts say there is a need to seek long-term solutions for uninterrupted trade with the southern neighbour. “There must be a mutual recognition agreement on select exportable items. Under such an agreement, exportable goods certified by the government will be recognised by the Indian government. This would be the best long-term solution for standard certification,” said Posh Raj Pandey, chairman of the South Asia Watch of Economics, Environment and Trade.Under the 2009 bilateral trade agreement with Nepal, India agreed to support the setting up of standard-purpose labs, said Pandey. However, Nepal has not been able to push for the labs during talks with India— even after 15 years of the agreement. He said lack of coordination among government agencies and frequent changes of bureaucrats have put the issue on the back burner. \nThe US has just concluded our generation's most eagerly watched presidential elections. Donald J Trump has won the White House resoundingly, and in addition, the Republican Party, also known as the Grand Old Party, has now wrested control of the Senate and has a comfortable majority in Congress. Simply put, Trump and the GOP now have complete control of the executive and legislative branches of the government, which will embolden the new Trump administration to pursue policies with determination. The world is closely watching how the Trump administration will usher in a new foreign policy paradigm that revolves around Trump’s “America First” philosophy. Foreign policy mandarins across the globe have mixed feelings about Trump's victory: Allies in Europe are gripped with anxiety, whereas in South Asia, there is a sense that since the rhetoric of Trump’s election campaign focused on combating China, Asia is on the cusp of witnessing unprecedented American engagement. It is in this context of American outreach in Asia that South Asia will play a pivotal role in shaping outcomes of a constantly evolving new world order. Nepal must remain steadfast in keeping up with developments of the great power games whilst constantly safeguarding and pursuing its interests independently. The heart of the US’s contention with China revolves around two critical issues: Trade and technology. The Covid-19 pandemic demonstrated to the world how global trade supply chains depended on supply lines in China. With the resurgence of the America First policy, the Trump administration is determined to impose new trade tariffs of up to 60 percent on Chinese exports. While the supposed new tariffs are likely to come into play in the second half of 2025, there is palpable fear that new trade tariffs could bring in disruptions to global trade as costs are likely to increase in the coming days. The Trump administration is determined to create new jobs to revitalise the economy by incentivising manufacturing in the country. Whilst Trump's plan to re-establish the US as a manufacturing hub is seen as a patriotic move, could higher labour costs in a developed country contribute towards lower production costs? The US’s trade conflict with China presents other developing nations in Asia with a unique opportunity to attract investments in the manufacturing industry. Although it is outlandish to suggest China will be entirely substituted as a manufacturing hub, the emergence of new manufacturing opportunities in the global south presents the US with the opportunity to fuel economic growth essential for the sustenance of democracy. South Asia gives the US a unique avenue for enhanced collaboration. With a democratic polity spread across most of South Asia’s landmass, job creation and energy production are the key elements for stability in the region. The Indo-Gangetic delta is among the most populous regions in the world and possesses the human capital to fuel economic growth across South Asia. Although the Civilian Nuclear Deal between India and the US is a milestone agreement for the use of clean nuclear energy to generate electricity in India, the nuclear plants in India only contribute 3.11 percent of the total electricity generated in India. For India to meet the energy requirements to set up a large-scale industrial base, access to high-quality uninterrupted energy will be critical for industrialisation in India and across South Asia. The Millennium Challenge Corporation pact signed between Nepal and the US is a significant breakthrough in Nepal’s energy sector, as American investment in upgrading transmission line infrastructure is greatly required to transport high-quality, uninterrupted energy.Nepal still requires robust investment in the transmission side to feed supply lines across South Asia. The fact that Nepal, Bangladesh and India have signed a power trade agreement demonstrates the potential of Nepal’s energy sector in fuelling energy to propel economic growth in the region. South Asia missed the industrial flight back in the decades of the 80s and the 90s; it’s time the region reaped the benefits of the US capital that could trigger a wave of industrialisation. Another focal point of tension between the US and China is the issue of semiconductors. The US would want to retain the technological leadership of high-end chips in the hands of its allies, namely Taiwan, South Korea and the Netherlands. Currently, the world relies solely on Taiwan and its crown jewel, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (TSMC), for high-end chips—TSMC has a market share of 90 percent of advanced chip manufacturing. Both the US and China know the strategic advantage one can gain by accessing high-end chips, which is critical for next-generation AI modelling in sectors such as defence, intelligence, telecom, medicine and aerospace. The ability to store big data also depends on the quality and the advanced functioning of high-end chips. In simple words, the US’s ability to retain control and contain access to high-end chips to compete whilst diversifying the production of low-end chips will provide the US and its allies the political leverage it desperately wants. The tech industry in South Asia has been recognised as a force to reckon with, particularly in India and the periphery of Bangladesh. Sri Lanka seems to have made progress, while Nepal also aspires to expand its tech business reach. Cross-border payments, the expansion of data centres and the use of technology in the delivery of governance are areas of expansive collaboration. India’s ability to produce low-end chips in the future is also critical to expanding the tech industry in South Asia, as indigenously produced chips can help reduce manufacturing costs and the tech industry’s dependency on accessing chips elsewhere, which are always in high demand globally. But there are also areas of concern for South Asia regarding Trump’s ascendency to the White House. Trump has vowed to pull out of the Paris Climate Agreement and climate change is an issue that confronts South Asia, particularly Nepal. Nepal has witnessed firsthand the impacts of climate change and, therefore, the country and South Asia at large cannot afford to ignore the impact of climate change. This issue cannot become secondary for either Nepal or the region. Climate change challenges the livelihoods of our people, and the Government of Nepal must voice its concern visibly and work towards creating strategic alliances that will compel the new US administration to rethink walking away from Paris Climate Agreement. The new US administration and its South Asian partners must work on issues impacting human welfare to achieve wider social and economic participation in the democratic process in the region. Trump’s vision of America First is virtuous, but to restore the US’s trust globally, he must take its allies into confidence.  \nHow big will the impact be as Nepal’s major international airport closes for ten hours starting Friday?Economists say it’s too early to quantify, but the losses for the Nepali economy will be huge.Nepal’s economic momentum has slowed down since the late September floods, and the government’s decision to close the key airport could stifle growth.“It will be a big setback for the country’s ailing economy as it will hit tourism and business activities, including transport, hotels, restaurants, telecommunication and other sectors,” said Bishwambhar Pyakurel, a noted economist. Pyakurel called it a deliberate “restriction” imposed by the government, despite it having many alternatives to carry out construction at the airport.Tickets prices are soaring, with most destinations, including Nepal’s labour markets, witnessing a fourfold price rise due to a widening gap between supply and demand.A notice to airmen, popularly known as NOTAM, issued by the Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal, states that the airport will be closed from 10pm to 8am from Friday for five months, until March 31, to expand the taxiways. The airport is currently closed from 2am to 6am. Two parallel taxiway projects are ongoing at the Tribhuvan International Airport in Kathmandu. The extension of the parallel taxiway was initially planned in 2009.Travel trade entrepreneurs said the civil aviation body’s mismanagement could shave off at least Rs50 billion in airline and tourism industry revenues, even as the government struggles with revenue generation.The outlooks for 2024-2025 of the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank, and the International Monetary Fund forecast economic recovery on the basis of improved tourist arrivals in Nepal. Growth in food, transport, and accommodation sectors have been better than expected even as other economic indicators lag.In September, the Asian Development Bank revised Nepal’s economic growth forecast upward to 4.9 percent for the current fiscal year beginning mid-July, based on projected agricultural and electricity output growth and buoyant tourist arrivals.The National Statistics Office’s annual account estimated that accommodation and food service activities, which are linked to tourism, would see a robust growth of 21.84 percent, the highest among 18 economic compositions in the Nepali economy, in the last fiscal year ended mid-July.According to the respective ministries, the late monsoon floods and landslides affected agriculture and electricity output, and now tourism has received a big jolt.It will be more painful for domestic airlines as winter will bring more fog and pollution, curtailing flight frequencies.“It’s an unplanned construction,” said Pyakurel. “Today, time is money. For trading, business and leisure, coming to Nepal will be a big challenge,” he said, adding that the airfares are so high that tourists and businessmen will think twice before flying. Hoteliers say that due to high ticket prices, key events planned in Kathmandu have either been postponed or cancelled.As part of the improvement plan, a 1,140-metre-long parallel taxiway is being built on the runway’s southern side, or the Koteshwar end. This will connect the existing international apron to the end of runway 02.Similarly, another 450-metre-long parallel taxiway is being built at the northern end of the runway.Considering the planned infrastructure, the maximum runway capacity will see 42 aircraft movements per hour in mixed-mode operation, enabling 187,000 aircraft movements per year from the 128,449 flight movements last year. In 2023, the Kathmandu airport recorded 8.7 million passengers—4.54 million international air travellers and 4.15 million domestic ones, according to statistics of the Tribhuvan International Airport.Similarly, in terms of flight movement, the airport handled 128,449 flight movements—31,460 flights by international airlines and 96,989 by domestic carriers.Travel trade entrepreneurs say the ill-planned construction would take way too long, extending until another peak tourism season in spring (March).“These will be painful months for travel trade entrepreneurs as the plan is being implemented in the peak tourism season. We, however, cannot oppose the airport’s infrastructure development,” said Sagar Pandey, president of the Trekking Agencies Association of Nepal.“On different occasions, we have suggested that the government and the civil aviation body find alternatives to such a long closure, such as incentivising airlines to fly from Bhairahawa and Pokhara international airports.”However, international airlines are hesitant to connect to the new airports, which have remained idle for months due to the technical and financial issues of flying to them.Pandey said they might lose at least 40 percent of trekkers this year considering the flight cancellations.Nepal Tourism Board has revised its 2024 tourist arrival forecast to 1.1 million from the projected 1.3 million. As of October, Nepal has received 900,000 tourists.Some entrepreneurs say that five hours of construction time, as it used to be, was appropriate, but insiders suspect that a 10-hour closure would force many airlines to divert to Bhairahawa. For instance, on October 27, the Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal (CAAN) took action against a Thai AirAsia flight, refusing to allow it to land at Kathmandu airport.Media reports show that the flight was later permitted. However, after the plane landed, authorities temporarily suspended the airline and its general sales agent. Later the restrictions were lifted on the “condition” that the airline would fly from Bhairahawa as well. Airline officials say the “punitive measure” was not the aviation regulator’s first action. On October 30, 2022, the CAAN cancelled Nepal Airlines’ scheduled flight to Delhi as punishment for defying instructions to move some of its international services to the newly-built Bhairahawa airport.Nepal Airlines’ jet remained on the ground, and more than 500 passengers were affected by the last-minute cancellation.“I would like to seriously draw the attention of the government that Tribhuvan International Airport is being closed for 10 hours daily from November 8 to March 31. It cannot be considered normal to close an international airport for 10 hours to build structures. Earlier, during the rehabilitation of the main runway, the airport was closed only for 5/7 hours at night,” lawmaker Udaya Shumsher Rana wrote on X on October 29.“It is clear that closing the Kathmandu airport means diverting flights to Pokhara and Bhairahawa to show that those two airports are fine. There are technical reasons behind international airlines not being ready to fly to these two airports. Undoubtedly, the Civil Aviation Authority leadership is trying to hide its weaknesses by closing the Kathmandu airport for 10 hours.”Rana argued that if this decision is not revised, Nepal’s global image and tourism business would suffer. The airport closure will also hit domestic flights. Buddha Air, Nepal’s largest domestic carrier, currently operates 180 daily flights. As the airline must reduce its flights to 135, there will be a substantial drop in its revenue and government’s taxes. Some other domestic airlines have complained to the regulator that flight allocation is not proportionate under the new arrangement. \n\n\nRae was the envoy to Kathmandu during the promulgation of the 2015 constitution and the subsequent blockade. In this conversation, Rae talks about the evolution of Nepal-India ties since the blockade, regional geopolitics, what the two countries get wrong about each other, how New Delhi views Nepali communist parties and the governments they lead, and the change (if any) in India’s neighbourhood policy since the start of Narendra Modi’s third term in office. \nKunwar has been the MD for just under three years. Before coming back to her homeland to join Daraz Nepal, she worked at different American companies, including Amazon, the world’s biggest e-commerce platform.

They called on private medical colleges to allocate seats for MD/MS courses only after ensuring that monthly living allowances equivalent to an officer (eighth level in administrative hierarchy) are provided.This demand follows a prior decision by the Medical Education Commission, which had initially mandated private colleges to provide the stipulated allowances before seat allocation. However, under directives from Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli, the commission reversed its decision and proceeded with seat allocation, sparking widespread dissatisfaction among healthcare professionals.Leaders from various organisations, including Dr Sheshraj Ghimire of the Safe Workplace Struggle Committee for Health Workers and Dr Uttam Chaulagai, president of the National Association of Resident Doctors, have expressed their discontent with the government’s move. Other signatories of the statement included representatives from Tribhuvan University Teaching Hospital, Patan Academy of Health Sciences, and Pokhara Academy of Health Sciences, among others.The resident doctors have urged the government to prioritise implementing the agreement reached on September 30, 2023, which promised uniformity in allowances for resident and intern doctors across private and public sectors. Currently, private medical colleges provide allowances ranging from Rs19,000 to Rs24,000—far below the agreed standard.The doctors have accused private institutions of exploiting them by withholding fair allowances. They stated unequivocally that they would be compelled to halt work and launch protests if the government proceeded without addressing their concerns.“We cannot accept the allocation of seats without a guarantee of Rs48,000 monthly allowances,” the statement read. “If our plea is ignored, we will have no choice but to quit our jobs and take to the streets.”The controversy deepened after Sunday’s meeting at the prime minister’s residence in Baluwatar, where the Medical Education Commission decided to allow private colleges to claim MD/MS seats without ensuring the prescribed allowances. The decision has drawn sharp criticism from resident doctors, who described it as a step backwards in safeguarding their rights and welfare. \nThe conflict between the Kathmandu Metropolitan City Mayor Balendra Shah and leadership of the ruling party, the CPN-UML, seems to be deepening as the two sides show no sign of rapprochement.In the latest episode, the KMC has fined the ruling UML Rs100,000 for littering the streets of the capital city Kathmandu while holding a mass meet on Friday. Within hours of the conclusion of the UML’s ‘Awakening rally against anarchy’ at Durbarmarg in downtown Kathmandu, the KMC made public a decision saying that the city office had fined the ruling party.But the UML leadership took serious exception to the mayor’s action. “It can be understood that Kathmandu Metropolis Mayor Balen [Balendra] has been used [by someone] against the CPN-UML, which has become clearer after the issuance of today’s ‘pamphlet’,” UML General Secretary Shankar Pokhrel wrote on Facebook a few hours after the issuance of the city office’s fine notice. He claimed that members of the rally organising committee were busy cleaning the area on their own when the metropolitan officials issued the notice.KMC representatives reached the UML party office in Chyasal on Sunday to hand over the receipt of the fine issued on Friday. After the party refused to receive it, the notice of fine was sent to the party office by email today (Monday), said Nabin Manandhar, KMC spokesperson. UML’s office secretary, Bhisma Adhikari, denied the allegations that the party littered the street during the rally. If there had been rubbish, our cadres would have cleaned it up. Adhikari said, “But the KMC issued a notice against us to defame our party, which is a politically motivated action.” Adhikari also stated that his party wouldn’t pay the fine and that the party office had not received any mail from the KMC. The City’s assistant spokesperson, Dhurba Kumar Kafle, differs. Kafle says a team from the environment department and the metropolitan police were present at the demonstration venue. It was only after inspecting the ground that the KMC slapped a fine, he said.Political observers say the KMC has been selective in imposing the fine. They, however, criticised the party for disrupting the traffic on Friday, badly affecting people’s daily lives.“Picking a party to impose a fine but turning a blind eye to similar activities carried out by other parties shows the City’s bias,” Keshav Dahal, a political analyst, said. “To prove they are not biased, the KMC from now on should penalise other political forces and groups as well for carrying out similar activities.” For the past few months, the streets of Kathmandu have witnessed many protests by various political parties. Before the UML, the main opposition party, CPN (Maoist Centre), organised a protest rally on October 26 in Kathmandu. Until recently, the Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP) was in the street, holding multiple street protests in Kathmandu, claiming the arrest of their party chief Rabi Lamichhane was politically motivated. The City spokesperson Manandhar denied the allegation of being biased. “When the other parties had organised protests, the KMC did not see the necessity of issuing a fine as there was less garbage,” Manandhar said. “But the UML’s gathering compelled us to issue a notice of fine.” Jhalak Subedi, a political analyst, however thinks both the UML and the KMC are engaging in stunts.“The City issued a fine against UML and the UML put up a vehement denial after being imposed a fine. Both were doing stunts,” Subedi said. But it would have been more mature of the UML to respond to the KMC as per existing laws, he added.“If there is a lack of a policy in this connection, the UML could have vowed to bring the policy so that such incidents can be better handled in the future,” Subedi said.On April 9, the KMC had fined the Rastriya Prajantra Party (RPP) Rs5,000 for littering the streets of Kathmandu while staging a protest. Recalling the episode, Nilkantha Kafle, the treasurer of the RPP, said that the party had paid the fine.“We realised that we could have made a mistake by not cleaning up the streets after demonstrations. So we paid the fine,” Kafle said. Political analyst Subedi reckons the latest incident could be the result of bitter relations between UML chair KP Sharma Oli and KMC mayor Balendra Shah.Of late, Prime Minister Oli and other leaders from his party have been engaged in one after another dispute with Mayor Shah. On June 3, Shah accused Oli of engaging in ‘policy corruption’ by being involved in illegal land swap of Giri Bandhu Tea Estate in Jhapa. After that, then deputy prime minister and minister for Physical Infrastructure and Transport Raghubir Mahaseth tried to halt the mayor’s plan to widen pavements in the Capital’s New Road area. Mayor Shah even sent metropolitan workers to dump a truckload of dirt in front of the office of the road department, which is under Mahaseth’s ministry.In September, Mayor Shah criticised Prime Minister Oli for failing to take action against UML provincial assembly member Rekha Sharma, who was accused of abusing a child domestic worker for eight years.“The court has also decided to prosecute the accused,” Shah wrote on Facebook. “Respected prime minister, good governance entails taking action against your lawmaker accused of domestic violence.”“Perhaps to you, good governance is limited to announcing a compensation of Rs100,000 and shedding crocodile tears on Facebook over her death,” Mayor Shah wrote on the social media post. Previously, the UML and Mayor Shah had argued for and against implementing the Supreme Court ruling that ordered vacating the Bagmati riverside land.  \nPrime Minister and CPN-UML chair KP Sharma Oli can stoop any low when it comes to criticising his opponents. Making below-the-belt remarks, blending them with ukhan tukka (proverbs and quips), is his signature style of public speeches, which are often lengthy.However, Oli’s address at the party’s mass gathering on Friday didn’t follow his common style. Yet he spent a significant chunk of his around 45-minute speech on criticising some individuals and political parties, but not in his fiery manner.Party’s general secretary Shankar Pokhrel had set a tone for the gathering, which was named “Awakening Rally against Anarchy” by the ruling party, clarifying the allegations levelled against his party and supremo Oli mainly by controversial businessman Durga Prasai.Prasai, disclosing unsubstantiated documents, claimed that Oli has invested $250 million in a Cambodian telecom company. Police have arrested him, accusing him of making serious allegations with the mala fide intention of defaming the prime minister. “Our chairperson has said he will provide the money to the person who can establish his investment there,” said Pokhrel, claiming a section is making one after another baseless allegations to defame Oli. He also tried to paint a nationalist picture of his party arguing it has never taken any decision against the national interest which is why conspiracies are hatched against the party to the extent of splitting it.Oli started his address by trying to justify why the current Nepali Congress-UML coalition was formed and assuring how it will remain intact until the next elections. He claimed that he will remain as prime minister until June 2026 and hand over the premiership to Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba until the next general elections to be held at the end of 2027. “Let there be no confusion, this coalition is here to stay until the next elections,” he said. “I request you to dispel the rumours that this government will not last longer.”Oli remarked that he inherited the prime ministerial seat laden with huge state loans, a crisis-ridden national economy, high level of corruption and low-spirited industrialists. Like on every public platform, he reiterated that the ruling coalition was formed to uplift the country from its falling economy, establish good governance, control corruption, promote entrepreneurship and to put it on the path of prosperity.The UML in July broke its partnership with the CPN (Maoist Centre) to form a government led by Oli. Shattered, the Maoist Centre has been claiming that the two largest parties were worried by its crackdown against the corrupt and criminals. Therefore, leaders from the two parties formed the government to protect their cronies. Maoist leaders spare no opportunity to label the Oli government “corrupt”.Without naming any party or leader, Oli at the rally dared anyone to argue with the UML with evidence. “I will neither commit corruption, nor will allow anyone to do so,” he reiterated. “It is ironic that those who have amassed billions of rupees, enough for seven generations, are accusing the UML of corruption.” He devoted some minutes of his speech to lambasting Prasai who accused him of investment in Cambodia. “Anything can be claimed for the sake of claiming. There is 32,000 crores [Rs320 billion] in Cambodia, and as much in the Swiss Bank. You can go and check it. Why just that, half of the deposits in American banks are mine. There is no point making senseless statements,” he said, adding that in modern times checking who has invested in the Cambodian telecom sector is a simple job.Though he claimed nobody really buys such baseless claims and his party is unbothered about the acts of such a handful of anarchic people, his stress on clarifying Prasai’s claim clearly demonstrated his apprehension. His government has already arrested Prasai, which, according to Oli, is a move against the attempts of the anarchic forces to disrupt social harmony and cohesion.Rastriya Swatantra Party was another target of Oli. He reiterated that no corrupt individual will be spared and no innocent one will be framed. Criticising the act of holding rallies against the government to oppose the arrest of party president Rabi Lamichhane, Oli said it is shameful to denounce others when “you yourself indulge in fraud”. “There is enough evidence of fraud in the cooperatives against you. You are deceiving hundreds of people, yet scolding others,\" said Oli.Oli used the mass gathering to vent his ire at Nepal Electricity Authority Managing Director Kulman Ghising, claiming that the latter's moves were targeted at discouraging the industrialists. On a different note, the prime minister defended his decision to visit China before India, calling critics “absurd” and “cowardly” for questioning his diplomatic priorities.“Where is it written that one must visit a particular country first? Is it in religious texts, the Constitution, or the UN Charter?” Oli asked, while addressing a mass meeting organised by the UML in Kathmandu.His remarks are directed at former prime minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal, who suggested in an interview with Indian newspaper The Hindu that Oli was playing the “China card” by prioritising a visit to China over India. Oli’s UML, in a statement earlier, condemned Dahal’s statement.Oli reiterated Nepal’s commitment to maintaining balanced relations with all neighbours. “We will foster ties with all our neighbours based on mutual respect and equality while safeguarding our sovereignty and national interests,” he said. “We harbour no enmity towards anyone; we have no enemies.”The prime minister also expressed his confidence in the success of his upcoming visit to the north. “This is not a casual trip. I will personally report its success upon my return,” Oli said.The UML might have named the gathering an awakening rally, but neither Oli nor his party leaders made any new remarks on Friday. Though the second largest party had claimed to parade 100,000 supporters, the number was not even a fourth of the planned strength. However, it was enough to obstruct the traffic in most parts of the Capital. People suffered hugely as vehicular movement was disturbed throughout the day due to the rallies and the gathering. \nA series of events unfolding at least for the past eight months has pushed the Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP) into a difficult situation, leaving the leaders of the two-year-old party confused.The RSP leaders look more perplexed following the arrest of party president Rabi Lamichhane on the allegations of involvement in embezzling tens of millions of rupees from various cooperatives.Police arrested Lamichhane, who is also a former deputy prime minister and home minister, from the party’s central office in Kathmandu on October 18 following an arrest warrant from the Kaski District Court.After that district courts in Rupandehi, Kathmandu and Chitwan also issued arrest warrants against Lamichhane and others on charges of embezzling funds from the cooperatives. Lamichhane, among other individuals, is accused of embezzling deposits from Kathmandu-based Swarnalaxmi Cooperative, Pokhara-based Suryadarshan Cooperative, Butwal-based Supreme Cooperative and Bharatpur-based Sahara Chitwan Cooperative.RSP announced protest programmes in Pokhara and Kathmandu on October 19, a day after Lamichhane's arrest, claiming that the party chief’s arrest was politically motivated.The party also staged demonstrations in Bhairahawa when Lamichhane was taken in custody for interrogation for his involvement in misappropriating funds from the Supreme Cooperative based in Butwal. However, the RSP, which has announced the second phase of its protest for November 23, has decided to change its strategy.The party’s central committee meeting on Tuesday witnessed division among the central committee members over the modality of protest. Then the meeting on November 20 eventually decided to change the format for the second-phase protest. “Few leaders at the central committee meeting argued that the second phase of protest should not be different from the first one,” a central committee member of the party told the Post on the condition of anonymity. “But, in view of the protest’s little public appeal, the party decided to change its form in the second phase.”However, central committee member Hari Dhakal, who is also a lawmaker, refuted the claim. Dhakal argued that the party decided to change the protest format considering the by-election scheduled for December 1, in which the RSP has fielded its candidacy in 27 out of 44 seats up for grabs.“This time, we plan to make the people aware of our agenda through the election campaign. Therefore, all the protests ahead are not street-centric,” Dhakal told the Post.According to the party leaders privy to the developments, despite Dhakal's claim, some who spoke at the November 19 central committee meeting argued that the public was not interested in the agenda they pursued following Lamichhane’s arrest.Dhakal agreed that the RSP often seemed confused while making a political decision after the party chair’s arrest. Lamichhane has so far not given any definite role to other leaders to oversee the party affairs in his absence. “Naturally, a new party like ours will have a certain kind of dilemma in the absence of the main leader,” Dhakal added. “However, this does not mean that the political activities of our party have come to a standstill.”In a country like Nepal, it is natural that parties are often individual-centric, and the RSP is not different, says a political analyst. “In a leader-centric party, it is natural that the absence of central leadership often puts the party in a tight spot while taking major political decisions,” Chiranjibi Bhandari, a political analyst who is also an assistant professor at the central department of Conflict, Peace and Development Studies, told the Post. Following its impressive performance in the 2022 general elections and the 2023 by-elections, many observers extrapolated a mighty electoral success for the RSP in the following years. In their reckoning, the party was expected to challenge the Nepali Congress and the UML, the two oldest and biggest players of Nepali politics, in the national elections due in 2027.However, everything was not well with the party. When the RSP candidate fared badly in the Ilam-2 by-election held in April, the party’s leaders drew up a conclusion that something had gone wrong with the party organisation. Then, the RSP entrusted then-party general secretary Mukul Dhakal with touring various parts of the country and studying the matter. Dhakal, the party's founding general secretary, visited 38 districts and submitted a review report to the party committee. As Dhakal also leaked the report to the media it caused a storm within the party as his finding chiefly blamed chair Lamichhane for the party’s diminishing image in the public.The report resulted in Dhakal's expulsion from the party.The problem deepened when the parliamentary special committee formed to investigate the crisis-ridden cooperatives implicated the party’s chair in a case of cooperatives funds misuse. While the party rank and file vehemently denied the claim, Lamichhane’s arrest came as a big blow to the RSP.Some current indications are certainly not encouraging for RSP leaders. The party reportedly found no candidate for the Kirtipur mayoral election scheduled for December 1.The Ilam and Kirtipur episodes suggest that the RSP has failed to expand its command down to the grassroots, experts say.Senior vice-president of RSP, DP Aryal acknowledged that his party failed to find an appropriate candidate in Kirtipur Municipality, which could be normal for any other party. “We were looking for a candidate who could carry the values and principles of our party,” Aryal told the Post. “After not finding an appropriate candidate in Kirtipur Municipality, we took a decision to not field anyone who could not champion the principles and values of our party.” The RSP sent a chilling message to the major traditional forces when it emerged the fourth largest party in the November 2022 election, just six months after its establishment. In the 2023 by-elections, it gained one more seat.However, within two years, the party was in a position to change its protest format, claiming it was failing to attract public support. Does this signal the party is in serious trouble?“New political parties like the RSP got traction due to the public disenchantment towards the traditional political parties, not because of their own political agenda,” said Bhandari. “The party has yet to prove itself in the public eye.” Political analyst Bhandari further added that they might have switched the protest format after the earlier one did not work. “It, however, would be too early to call it a downfall of the party,” he added.“The party is indeed in a dilemma after Lamichhane’s arrest. However, shifting the protest strategy cannot be termed otherwise,” Bhandari said. \nCandidates for mayor in Kirtipur Municipality, where a by-election is being held on December 1, have started their election campaign. In the race are a total of 20 candidates—nine from various political parties and 11 independents.In the 2022 local elections, independent candidates presented a formidable challenge to political party candidates in various local units. Independent candidates won mayorships in the Kathmandu Metropolitan City, the Dharan Sub-Metropolitan City and the Dhangadhi Municipality. Will the outcome in Kirtipur be different this time, or will the traditional parties prevail? The by-election comes after the death of Rajkumar Nakarmi, former Mayor of Kirtipur Municipality, who died in July due to kidney failure. He had won on a Nepali Congress ticket.Major political parties including the Congress, the CPN-UML and the CPN (Maoist Centre) have fielded their candidates. But the fourth largest political party in the House of Representatives, the Rastriya Swatantra Party, did not field anyone reportedly after failing to find a suitable candidate.The candidates include Krishnaman Dangol from the Congress, Surendra Manandhar from the UML, and Shiva Sharan Maharjan from the Maoist Centre. Besides these, seventeen others, including 11 independents, have filed their nominations. Candidates from other parties include Dil Kumar Maharjan of the Nepal Samajbawadi Party, Shri Krishna Maharjan of the Nepal Majdoor Kishan Party, Dhurba Maharjan of the Rastriya Prajatantra Party, and Keshav Shrestha of the Janamat Party. Similarly, independent candidates include Navaraj Kumar Baniya, Rajman Manav, Ram Krishna Maharjan, Mim Maharjan, Prem Bahadur Maharjan, Dinesh Kumar Adhikari, Naresh Shrestha, Dharmaratna Manandhar, Ananda Maharjan, Nareshraj Pande, and Kabir Kumar Maharjan. In the 2022 local elections, the Congress candidate Nakarmi won the mayorship with 9,043 votes, while his closest competitor, Keshav Ratna Bajracharya of the UML, secured 5,507 votes. The Maoist Centre’s Shiva Saran Maharjan, who is contesting for the position in the by-election, had obtained 4,090 votes then. Of the total 31,112 registered voters, almost 14,000 live in the core area of Kirtipur, and the remaining 17,000 reside in the peripheral regions. The core area includes the municipality’s wards 1, 2, 3, 9, 10, including Tyanglaphat, whereas the peripheral areas include wards 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8. The core area is predominantly inhabited by the Newar community, while the peripheral region is more diverse with migrants in big numbers. Political leaders and analysts say that the peripheral region will be decisive in the election.But Congress candidate Krishnaman Dangol disputes this claiming that the concept of peripheral region is a misrepresentation. “The area that some people call ‘peripheral’ is in fact the core of Kirtipur,” Dangol told the Post. “From Nagau, Panga, Bhajungle, to Chobhar all are part of Kirtipur’s core area.”UML candidate Surendra Manandhar agrees with Dangol and says dividing the local unit along community lines is not a good idea.Dangol, the Congress candidate, considers UML’s Manandhar his close competitor, but some local residents say the true challenge could come from the Maoist Centre’s Shiva Sharan Maharjan, who had a strong showing in the 2022 local election. “Majarjan already contested and did well. The UML’s Manandhar is new, therefore we believe there will be a tough competition between the Congress and the Maoist Centre,” said a local resident.The Maoist Centre has also forged an electoral alliance with the CPN (Unified Socialist) and the Janata Samajbadi-Nepal, led by Upendra Yadav, to strengthen its bid.“I lost the previous election due to a technical mistake, but this time, we are confident of a win,” the Maoist Centre candidate Maharjan told the Post. He said his chances have improved due to the growing public disenchantment towards the current ruling Congress-UML coalition.But UML’s Manandhar appears unbothered by the competition. He said he is better prepared than others and is confident of a win.For the Congress, the contest appears more difficult as former Congress party members are running as independents. Kabir Kumar Maharjan and Dinesh Kumar Adhikari, who were previously with the Congress, are among the independent candidates.“The situation of Congress is different. For other parties, winning adds a seat, but losing doesn’t make much difference because they hadn’t won this seat in the previous election,” Himal Karki, a local Congress leader, told the Post. “But, for Congress, there’s a pressure to win because this is a seat our party earlier won.”An overwhelming presence of independent candidates makes the contest more complex for Congress, as local figures who have established their own identity in Kirtipur, such as Rajman Manav, are getting considerable voter attention.Harka Sampang, the independent mayor of Dharan Sub-metropolitan City, has also expressed his support for Manav. Sampang is set to join Manav’s election campaign starting from November 23.“Harka Sampang will be in Kirtipur for my election campaign,” Manav told the Post.Congress candidate Dangol, meanwhile, does not consider Manav as a competitor. He claimed that Manav is a former UML cadre and quit the party to focus on social activities, especially sanitation campaigns. “So Manav could draw UML votes, not ours,” Dangol said.Meanwhile, Suresh Maharjan, a Kirtipur resident who identifies himself as a Maoist Centre sympathiser, says the votes garnered by independent candidates will determine the election’s outcome.  \nDharahara, which reopened to the public on Constitution Day this year, has started charging entry fees from Sunday. Over 90,000 people have climbed the new iconic tower for free since it opened on September 19, but visitors will now need to pay Rs200 per person. Students, senior citizens, and persons with disabilities will be given a 50 percent discount.The Ministry of Urban Development said a fee for visitors from SAARC countries is Rs500 per person, while those from non-SAARC countries will have to pay Rs1,000 each. Entry into the Dharahara premises will cost Rs50. Fees for commercial activities are higher. For instance, it has been set at Rs5,000 per hour for videography, Rs1,000 per hour for photography, and Rs5,000 per hour for non-commercial advertisements on the Dharahara tower. Prakash Aryal, director of the Central Project Implementation Unit (Building and Housing) under the ministry, said that visitors may sometimes face delays as the new system is in the initial stage of implementation. “The time required to manage operations after implementing the fee system might cause delays for those climbing Dharahara,” Aryal said. Visitors can access the tower between 10am and 4pm, but operating hours may be adjusted later. The historic tower will remain closed every Wednesday.The International Convention Centre in New Baneshwar will look after the management until a dedicated committee is formed.The government has declared Dharahara and five other structures, including Jhapa’s Damak View Tower, as ‘special structures’. The Urban Development Ministry has issued an order to facilitate their operation under a public-private partnership model, proposing to lease their management to private entities through competitive bidding. “Minimal fees have been introduced to cover operational expenses such as utilities, staff salaries, and maintenance,” said Mani Ram Gelal, secretary at the ministry. “The state does not intend to make a profit, only to recover costs.” He said it would take at least four months for a private operator to take over once the process is completed. “We cannot provide free access indefinitely, as there are expenses for water, electricity, and staff. While not seeking profit, the fees will help cover operational costs,” said Gelal. Aryal said that by adjusting the schedule and deploying more staff, up to 3,000 visitors could be accommodated daily. “Daily crowds were overwhelming during the free entry period,” he said. “Now we’ll see how the visitor numbers change after introducing fees.” The rebuilt tower, equipped with two lifts, still faces occasional technical problems. Leaks during Tihar, caused by an improperly closed door at the top of the tower, temporarily affected the lifts, but the issue has since been resolved. Online ticketing is expected to be introduced within a month. “Until then, visitors will need to buy tickets at the site,” Aryal said. The Dharahara reconstruction is nearly complete, but some electrical work remains pending. Aryal assured us that the pending work would not affect visitors climbing the tower.The iconic structure, which is historically taken as a major landmark of the capital city Kathmandu, was destroyed by 2015 earthquake. The tower, located at the heart of the City, was rebuilt and reopened to the public nine years after the natural disaster. \n\nWomen and young girls, once excluded from the tradition of playing Newari musical instruments, are now taking the lead in preserving and revitalising the centuries-old Newari musical tradition.One such example of change is the Lubhoo Dhaa Khala, which, according to its members, is the oldest Dhaa group in Lubhu of Lalitpur district. This group performs especially during jatras and other major Newari festivals.The group now boasts a new batch of around 40 musicians, 20 of whom are women and girls. These individuals are mastering the percussive Dhaa and Khin, and the cymbals Tah and Bhusya, instruments historically reserved for men.The group’s performances have now become a central part of local festivities, especially during the Gunla festival—a month-long celebration marking spiritual reflection and cultural devotion.The musical instrument Dhaa is central to the festival’s observance. Known as the Gunla baja, the Dhaa is revered as the Buddha’s favourite instrument and is believed to bring good luck and prosperity when played around chaityas and temples.“In the past, Newari instruments like the Dhaa were associated with male musicians, creating an exclusionary tradition,” says Bekh Narayan Shrestha, the head teacher of Lubhoo Dhaa Khala.However, as social attitudes evolve, so do the practices surrounding these cultural symbols. Women are now claiming their rightful place in this heritage, learning and performing with great panache.Bekh Narayan also says that while in the past playing this instrument was reserved for the higher Shrestha caste, today, caste is no longer a barrier—anyone can be a disciple.Concerned about the traditional instruments nearing extinction, Bekh Narayan took the initiative in 2000 to establish a group and personally began teaching students.While the Lubhoo Dhaa Khala began as a male-dominated group, its evolution into an inclusive space for women is an example of progress. Mandevi Shrestha, 38, who is Bekh Narayan’s daughter, is one beneficiary of the group’s outreach.“I was always a rebel,” Mandevi says. “I put pressure on my father, who was the group’s teacher, to teach us girls as well. I told him, ‘If boys in my own home can learn to play it, why can’t I?”Mandevi adds, “My persistence paid off, and in 2014, five women learners were included in the boys group.”When some women who had joined in 2014 migrated after marriage, the number of women in the group dwindled. At the time, conservative societal attitudes discouraged many women from learning alongside men. Moreover, the women were often not given priority. This led to a temporary halt in teaching women.However, over time, as more women expressed interest and the teachers faced pressure from within their own families—with their daughters and female relatives also wanting to play—by 2017 the group formally began recruiting all-female batches.“When we first started, there was evident discrimination,” says Ashmita Pradhan, 23, who started learning the instrument in 2014 and has been teaching all-female batches since 2017. “Women were not seen as equals then. I’m glad to see things have improved. Nowadays, young girls join the group with full family support.”The change is most evident in the current generation of musicians.Prayusha Shrestha, an 11-year-old student at Future Star Academy in Lubhu, began learning Dhaa in 2023. “After school, I would rush to finish my homework and run to the training sessions,” she says. “I was always excited to learn.”Another student, 20-year-old Sarishma Shrestha, adds, “From childhood, I listened to these instruments. But at the time, participation of girls wasn’t encouraged. When I finally got the chance last year, I was elated.”The inclusion of women in Lubhoo Dhaa Khala has inspired a new generation of learners, some of whom are under 10 years old. While others like Samira Shrestha (25), Neshana Shrestha (24), and Kriti Shrestha (23), have been playing since 2017. This trio belongs to the second batch of female learners, trained by Pradhan herself.According to Samira, in the past, when they played during jatras, there were very few women involved. Despite the judgmental stares, they played with confidence.“Today, the number of girls has increased significantly, and it’s great to see women and girls reclaim their space in preserving our culture, heritage, and music,” Samira says.However, there are still hurdles.According to Mandevi, some instruments, like the Khin, are still predominantly taught to men. “We’re advocating for change,” she says, “so that these traditions become fully inclusive.”For teacher Bekh Narayan, preserving Newari music goes beyond gender inclusivity.He emphasises the need for financial support to sustain the tradition. “Instruments are becoming more expensive,” he says. “We’ve introduced a donation box so even students can contribute, even if it’s just one rupee. We need support from the local government too.”Currently, in the Khala, only the girls from Lubhu are part of the group. So they are now planning to include married daughters-in-law as well.“This will help preserve our culture while empowering homemakers with Newari musicianship, ensuring the culture is passed down generations,” Bekh Narayan says.The members of Lubhoo Dhaa Khala believe their efforts go beyond cultural preservation.Sarishma notes that traditional instruments like the Dhaa enrich Nepal’s musical heritage. “They add diversity to the nation’s music scene, which is often overshadowed by modern and western influences,” she says.In Lubhu, the beats of the Dhaa are no longer produced by just one gender or generation.“Ten years ago, when there were few women, our dedication was often questioned,” Pradhan says. “Now, with more young girls joining, we feel empowered.” \nOne person was killed and five others injured in a tractor accident in Bhaktapur on Saturday.The incident occurred when the tractor lost control and overturned while travelling to Dekochha from Changunarayan.According to Deputy Superintendent of Police Dhundiraj Neupane of the District Police Office, Bhaktapur, 45-year-old Hari Govinda Suwal from Changunarayan Municipality-5 succumbed to his injuries while undergoing treatment at Bhaktapur Hospital. Four others—35-year-old Radhika Awal, 60-year-old Gopal Koju, 44-year-old Radheshyam Sitikhu, and 74-year-old Purnakesi Shilpakar—suffered minor injuries and were discharged after receiving treatment at the hospital.The 48-year-old driver, Ganesh Suwal, from Bhaktapur Municipality-2, is currently undergoing treatment at the hospital. \nThe Kathmandu Metropolitan City has designated 47 locations for floriculturists and flower vendors to sell flowers in Tihar.The city office’s move aims to avoid the inconvenience the floral vendors faced last year and reduce congestion on the sidewalks.“This year, we have designated 47 locations, most of them in shopping malls, marts, parks and party palaces,” said Dharma Raj Bhandari, a police inspector at the city office. “Farmers and vendors can take their products to those designated places and do business at their convenience. Our staff will help them reach the designated areas if they can not do so on their own.”Last year, many floral farmers from the adjoining districts of the Kathmandu Valley who brought flowers in the capital city could not sell their products due to restrictions the city office imposed in many places.The farmers were then allowed to sell flowers at Bhrikutimandap, Tinkune park, Handigaun and Balaju Valley Cold Store in coordination with the Floriculture Association of Nepal and the Nepal Chamber of Commerce. However, farmers and vendors discarded piles of flowers and garlands on footpaths and returned home, incurring heavy losses.The metropolis had deployed its staffers, including the metropolis police, to collect discarded flowers and garlands, which were dumped at the landfill site in Bancharedanda.Officials say that the malls, party palaces and parks will not charge farmers and vendors for providing space for selling flowers and garlands. KMC officials discussed the matter with the owners of the malls and party palaces and requested them to provide spaces for farmers to sell flowers and garlands in Tihar.“Floral farmers and vendors can sell flowers from other private places, but we will not allow them to obstruct footpaths,” said Laxmi Maharjan, a senior assistant sub-inspector of the KMC. “This year, we designated specified sales points in advance to avoid repeating last year’s situation.”The metropolis has also requested that people use flowers produced by Nepali farmers in Tihar and prohibit the sale, storage, distribution and use of plastic bouquets and flowers.“We have already confiscated plastic bouquets and flowers from many places,” said Maharjan. “We will fine traders if they ignore our warnings.”The metropolis has asked floral farmers and vendors to call the hotline 1180 or 015901763 and 9851356509 for help. \nA leader of the tea labour union in Darjeeling has asked India’s central government to stop the import of Nepali tea, claiming that it has harmed the Darjeeling tea brand.For the last few years, the demand to ban or impose an import duty on tea from Nepal has been growing louder in Darjeeling.Mamata Banerjee, the chief minister of West Bengal, India, visited Darjeeling a week ago and promised to halt the import of tea from Nepal. Earlier, in June, Santosh Kumar Sarangi, director general of India’s foreign trade, interacting with the Federation of Indian Export Organisations in Kolkata, said that both Darjeeling Tea and Nepal tea should be sold separately. While tea imports from Nepal could not be banned, mixing should be checked, he said.According to media reports, Sarangi said it was not possible to ban the import of Nepal tea due to geopolitical reasons. “As far as trade with Nepal is concerned, some flexibility is required,” he was quoted as saying on the occasion. Regarding the mixing of Darjeeling Tea and Nepal tea, there may be some collusion,” he said. A former chairman of the Tea Board, Sarangi, said the board had developed a traceability app for Darjeeling Tea.Shanta Chhetri, a former Rajya Sabha member, is the latest to raise the issue, demanding a 40 percent import duty on tea from Nepal. Sunil Rai, joint secretary of the Darjeeling Terai Dooars Chia Kaman Mazdoor Union, during a function in Siliguri demanding a bonus hike for Darjeeling tea labourers, said that Nepali tea sold in the name of Darjeeling tea should be banned.“Both West Bengal and the central government [of India] should take this initiative.”The function was organised to demand bonus hikes for Indian tea labourers, but it was centred more on Nepali tea.Speakers at the function also called for serious testing of the quality of Nepali tea.“Initially, we raised the issue of restricting Nepali tea. But the government has not paid attention to it. This will complicate the issue more in the future,” said Rai.In 2016, the Indian tea entrepreneurs and labour union submitted a memorandum to the then-Indian president, Pranav Mukharjee, demanding a ban on Nepali tea. The government did not take the demand seriously, and as a result Indian tea entrepreneurs and labour unions are still upset, according to reports.Labour leaders are of the view that Nepali tea has directly impacted Darjeeling tea.“To protect the tea industry, the central government needs to ban Nepali tea immediately,” said Rai.Nepali tea is mainly exported to India. According to Rai, an opportunist trade group exports the same tea to third countries with a ‘Darjeeling tea’ label.“Once Nepali tea is stopped, the demand for Darjeeling tea will increase sharply,” said another labour union leader. “Or else we are sure that the brand of Darjeeling tea will be tarnished gradually.”Labour unions believe that both the state and central governments need to take urgent action to protect the pride of the Darjeeling brand in the global market.Udaya Chapagain, director of Gorkha Tea Estate in Ilam, said that since the topography of Ilam and Darjeeling is similar, Nepali tea closely resembles Darjeeling tea. “This has caused many Indian tea entrepreneurs to fear losing global market share.”“India has a strategy to limit Nepali tea under different pretexts. For this, the Nepal government needs to pay attention on time.”In April, trucks laden with tonnes of tea destined for the southern neighbour got stuck at the Panitanki Customs across the Nepal-India border, as India asked its customs authorities to test the quality of Nepali tea bound for India.The halt came after India’s Commerce Ministry issued a circular to its customs offices to test the quality of all tea imports from Nepal.In 2005 and 2015, the Commerce Ministry of India had issued a similar circular to its customs to conduct mandatory lab tests on Nepali tea.Nepali tea samples are tested at the National Food Laboratory, Kolkata, India.Around 92 percent of Nepal-produced tea that is exported to India goes through the eastern border point, while 6 percent is exported from Biratnagar and 2 percent from Birgunj.According to the Trade and Export Promotion Center, Nepal exported 13,916 tonnes of tea worth Rs3.62 billion in the last fiscal year that ended in mid-July.Nepal’s tea exports sharply jumped by 44.3 percent to Rs1.86 billion in the first three months of the current fiscal year, which ended in mid-October.During the review period, Nepal exported 6,495 tonnes of tea, which accounted for 4.87 percent of the country’s total trade.Demand for Nepali tea has been rising as the bushes in Darjeeling have aged. Therefore, Nepali traders say the tea leaves have become a valuable input for the factories in and around Darjeeling.For years, Indian buyers have been alleging that Nepali tea is substandard and, as a result, offer lower prices. Nepali tea is often stopped at different border points under various pretexts. \nThe price of gold dropped by Rs15,900 per tola (11.664 grams) on Monday following the government’s decision to decrease the customs duty on the precious yellow metal. According to the Federation of Nepal Gold and Silver Dealers Association, the price of hallmark gold has been set at Rs151,300 per tola for today, down from Rs167,200 on Sunday.The government has slashed the customs duty on gold imports by 50 percent, from 20 percent to 10 percent. This decision was made during a Cabinet meeting on Thursday.Through its budget, India reduced the customs duty on gold and silver from 15 percent to 6 percent. In contrast, Nepal had increased the gold customs duty by 5 percent, raising it to 20 percent in the current fiscal year’s budget. This made gold more expensive in Nepal and cheaper in India, leading to smuggling.The Federation said the imbalance in customs duties due to the open border encouraged illegal trade. To prevent such trade, the Federation suggested that the customs duty be set at 8 percent. \n\nThe Ministry of Health and Population has decided to inspect medical bills issued by health facilities following growing complaints from patients and their families about exorbitant charges, particularly in private hospitals. Patients and their relatives have also complained that private hospitals and medical colleges often do not inform them about fees at the time of treatment, only to impose excessive charges during discharge, according to officials.“We have received several complaints from patients and their relatives about the excessive charges by health facilities, and such complaints are growing every day,” said Dr Prakash Budhathoky, spokesperson for the ministry. “We have already directed all health facilities, including medical colleges, to publish their fee structures on their websites.”Officials said Minister for Health and Population Pradip Paudel himself expressed concern about these growing complaints and instructed officials to regulate the charges.As per the ministry’s circular, health facilities must disclose outpatient department charges, bed fees, surgery charges, and lab fees, among other things.“We have also requested health agencies under provincial and local governments to regulate health facilities,” said Budhathoky. “They are requested to check if patients are being overcharged by health facilities.”Health officials said they are also planning to audit doctors’ prescriptions to see whether unnecessary medicines and tests are being prescribed. For this, the ministry plans to seek help from professional councils such as the Nepal Medical Council, the Nepal Pharmacy Council, and other agencies concerned.Experts say most ailments can be treated with medicines costing just a few hundred rupees, but some doctors force patients to buy vitamin supplements costing thousands of rupees. Patients and their relatives have also lodged complaints with the ministry about doctors' alleged wrongdoings and collusion with health facilities. They also complained that some hospitals force patients to undergo unnecessary tests costing high fees.Officials at the health ministry hope that an audit of doctors’ prescriptions will help address patients' complaints and grievances. Prescription audit is a systematic analysis and is in practice in many countries across the globe. It is carried out to find errors in doctors’ prescriptions and improve patient care.Officials say the decision to carry out a prescription audit was made to discourage malpractices involving doctors, pharmacists, importers, drug manufacturers, and hospitals.Under pressure from hospitals, patients are often made to undergo unnecessary and costly tests or are kept admitted in hospitals longer than necessary.An official at the ministry, asking not to be named since he is not authorised to speak to the media, said the Department of Drug Administration has banned certain vitamin supplements prescribed by doctors and sold openly in the market in combinations with specified solutions and agents.Some doctors and dispensaries have been taking undue advantage of poor patients, forcing them to buy additional vitamin supplements, the official said, adding that most patients are unaware and don’t ask if the supplements are necessary.Medical experts say that vitamin supplements are only needed in specific conditions, but most doctors prescribe them unnecessarily.Experts hope the prescription audit will help minimise irrational prescribing, improper dispensing, unnecessary testing and the practice of taking undue advantage of ailing patients. \nMalaysia should introduce pneumococcal vaccines for adults and high-risk groups following the steady rise in pneumonia-related deaths, say health experts.While pneumococcal vaccination is already part of the National Immunisation Programme for children, they said there is no such programme yet for adults, the elderly, and those with chronic conditions.Federation of Private Medical Practitioners’ Associations Malaysia president Dr Shanmuganathan Ganeson said Malaysia should integrate this vaccine as it has great public health benefits.“Many countries have successfully reduced pneumonia-related morbidity and mortality by integrating pneumococcal vaccines. Malaysia should follow suit.“It will help reduce hospital admissions by preventing severe pneumonia and invasive diseases, decrease healthcare costs by minimising complications and intensive care needs, and promote herd immunity by lowering bacterial transmission to protect unvaccinated individuals.“Cost-effectiveness studies in other nations suggest that national-level vaccinations could have a long-term economic benefit alongside improved health outcomes,” he said in an interview yesterday.Calling pneumonia a “highly avoidable disease”, Dr Shanmuganathan noted a rise in pneumonia-related deaths, particularly in 2021, due to Covid-19.“Even after recovery, some individuals experienced secondary bacterial infections, further increasing pneumonia risks,” he added.He pointed out that strained healthcare capacity also delayed treatment for other respiratory conditions.At the same time, an ageing population and prevalent non-communicable diseases like diabetes and heart disease heightened pneumonia risks.“The rise of antibiotic-resistant strains like Streptococcus pneumoniae has complicated treatment.“Also, the lack of widespread adoption of the pneumococcal vaccine, especially among high-risk groups, leaves a significant portion of the population vulnerable,” he said.Dr Shanmuganathan said the pneumococcal vaccine effectively reduces the risk of severe pneumococcal disease.He added that the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) can prevent up to 80% of invasive diseases in children.“For the elderly and high-risk groups, the vaccine significantly lowers the risk of complications and death.“Its efficacy varies depending on the individual health status and the vaccine type – either the PCV or the pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV).“Importantly, it offers protection against antibiotic-resistant strains of pneumococcus, addressing a growing concern.“Malaysians, especially high-risk groups, should get the pneumococcal vaccine available in hospitals and clinics.“This includes children under two, adults over 65, those with chronic diseases and the immunocompromised,” he said, adding that increasing the awareness of the benefits of the vaccine and its availability at most clinics is important.With pneumonia now the leading cause of death, Dr Shanmuganathan said it is essential to update the Covid-19 vaccination programme, focusing on new variants like XEC and vulnerable populations.He emphasised that a broader respiratory health strategy is needed, including promoting pneumococcal and influenza vaccinations and ensuring early diagnosis and treatment of respiratory infections.“Private general practitioners should be kept informed of these developments.“The Health Ministry must remain proactive, despite diverting staff to address the doctor shortage in clinical sectors,” he said.Association of Private Hospitals Malaysia president Datuk Dr Kuljit Singh said while Covid-19 infections may have been reduced, influenza cases are rising, with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) becoming more recognised as a significant infection.As such, he said the government should consider including pneumococcal vaccines in Malaysia’s national vaccination programme.The vaccines, he added, should also be made readily available at private medical facilities and selected clinics.“Such a programme should be introduced as it would help reduce morbidity and mortality, especially in the high-risk population.“Vaccines should be made widely available to reduce the cost and burden of treating illnesses,” he said.Dr Kuljit suggested that those in the high-risk group consider getting vaccinated to better protect themselves against pneumonia.He said private medical centres are currently using the latest vaccine, Vaxneuvance, which helps protect against 15 types of pneumococcus.The cost of pneumococcal vaccines ranges between RM280 and RM400, depending on the type used.When asked, Dr Kuljit said the steady rise in pneumonia-related deaths in the past decade could be from the large number of high-risk populations due to the nation’s ageing population and those suffering from non-communicable diseases, which result in compromised immune systems.He also said the increase in cigarette and e-cigarette smoking could also be a factor in the rise of such cases.Smoking damages the cilia (tiny hair-like structures) in the respiratory tract that help clear pathogens and debris.“This dysfunction can lead to a higher risk of respiratory infections, including pneumonia,” he said.-In Association with ANN \nThe Ministry of Health and Population has planned a meeting with senior officials, including secretaries serving at provincial ministries in Kathmandu, for the preparation of the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination drive.Officials at the ministry said that such a meeting with senior provincial officials is necessary to hold relevant agencies responsible for the success of the nationwide drive.“We got a go-ahead from the health ministry,” said Dr Abhiyan Gautam, chief of the Immunisation Section at the Family Welfare Division under the Department of Health Services. “We also want provincial governments to shoulder the responsibility of making the nationwide vaccination drive successful.”Human papillomavirus is a viral infection that spreads through skin contact and is a major cause of cervical cancer. Cervical cancer is the second-most common cancer in the developing world and a major cause of death among Nepali women. It is estimated that hundreds of women get diagnosed with cervical cancer in Nepal every year.Doctors say most cases of cervical cancer are linked to HPV, and widespread immunisation could significantly reduce the impact of cervical cancer and other HPV-related cancers worldwide.Officials say that during the nationwide campaign, over 1.68 million girls between 10 and 14 years will be administered the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine.“All eligible girls aged between 10 and 14 years will be vaccinated during the campaign,” said Gautam. “The vaccine will be administered in two doses over 12 months, with one dose given at the start and the second after 12 months.”The vaccine will be included in the routine immunisation programme following the compilation of the nationwide campaign. The Global Alliance for Vaccine and Immunisation (GAVI) will supply doses of the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine in December and has also provided the campaign’s operation cost.Nepal also has to pay a certain percent of the cost of the vaccine once it is included in the regular immunisation list, officials say.“We have started preparations for the campaign,” said Gautam. “Health workers nationwide, who will be mobilised for the vaccination campaign, are being imparted with the necessary training.”According to the BP Koirala Memorial Cancer Hospital in Bharatpur, more than 700 women suffering from cervical cancer seek treatment at the hospital every year.Experts say early treatment can prevent up to 80 percent of cervical cancer cases.Countries like Bhutan, Sri Lanka, Thailand and the Maldives have introduced HPV vaccines nationally, while India and Indonesia have introduced them in some districts.In 2016, Nepal piloted HPV vaccines in Chitwan and Kaski districts. During the pilot programme, all girls aged between 11 and 13 years were given two doses of the vaccine.Last year, Nepal purchased 20,000 doses of the HPV vaccine and administered it to around 9,000 girls aged between 14 and 15 years from all seven provinces. Health authorities administered the vaccines at schools after other measures failed to increase vaccine uptake.The World Health Organisation says HPV vaccination is recommended as part of a coordinated strategy to prevent cervical cancer and other diseases caused by the virus. \nDisruptive noises from North Korean loudspeakers have caused residents near the inter-Korean border to suffer for months, with some complaining that their health has been compromised, according to local governments on Nov 21.Data from a recent mental health assessment in Gimpo, Gyeonggi province, has shown that 28 per cent of the participants are experiencing significant mental health concerns. Conducted by the city’s mental health welfare centre from Aug 8 to 14, it assessed 102 residents living close to the border in Wolgot-myeon and Haseong-myeon.The data indicates that two individuals fell into a “high-risk category” for mental health issues, while 27 were labelled as being in a “watch” category, dealing with notable symptoms of stress and anxiety. The remaining 73 residents were considered to be within a normal range.Predominantly affecting the elderly population – many in their 70s and 80s – the noise has resulted in symptoms, such as sleep disorders, heightened stress and anxiety. These symptoms have been reported since the broadcasts started last September, making their daily lives increasingly intolerable, according to the assessment.The broadcasts, which consist of peculiar sounds like sirens and metal clanging, stop and start repeatedly at all hours, with a range of noise levels, according to local reports.“The eerie, metal-grinding sounds permeate the day and night from the North, depriving us of sleep and making daily life a challenge due to constant fear and anxiety,” one resident described.“We plan to offer psychological counselling and psychiatric treatment for those interested, aiming to enhance residents’ mental stability,” a Gimpo city official said.“Additionally, we are proposing measures to the Gyeonggi province and the central government, including temporary housing support, and installation of soundproof windows and doors.”North Korean broadcasts have also caused residents of Ganghwa-gun, Incheon, to suffer.The Incheon government plans to install soundproof facilities in the Dangsan-ri area, starting in early 2025.The noises, first reported in late July and described as high-pitched and similar to scraping metal, also feature sirens and drums and persist around the clock.Officials in Seoul believe this may be a retaliatory measure by the North against South Korea’s resumption of loudspeaker broadcasts earlier that month. Additionally, it might serve as a tactic to prevent North Korean citizens from hearing South Korean propaganda.Since late July, the South Korean military has been blaring daily propaganda broadcasts into North Korea, in response to the North’s launch of trash-carrying balloons which began in late May.These broadcasts include K-pop songs and news critical of Mr Kim Jong Un’s regime, such as reports on the defection of North Korean diplomats and soldiers. -In Association with Asia News Network \nDusit Princess Kathmandu is organising a five-day trout festival at its SOI restaurant. The dishes will be available for order from 12:30 pm to 10:00 pm every day till August 30. In celebration of Nepal’s rivers and lakes, which provide an ideal environment for high-quality trout, the Director of Culinary Food and Beverage Service, Chef Utpal Mondal, and his team at Dusit Princess Kathmandu have crafted a menu showcasing the flavours and versatility of locally sourced trout. “As the festive month of Shrawan ends, people focus on healthy and nutritious food. Trout, rich in omega-3 fatty acids, vitamins, and essential minerals, offers a heart-friendly option that checks all the boxes from a nutritional and culinary standpoint,” says Mondal.He adds that the goal of the culinary event is to offer their guests a rare opportunity to experience a wide variety of trout dishes they wouldn’t typically find at home.The event menu features twelve unique dishes, six of which are drawn from diverse culinary traditions across continents. Three dishes are inspired by oriental cuisine, while the remaining three highlight flavours from Nepal and India. The menu has been designed to include various dishes, from soups and starters to main courses, including Mexican, Italian, Continental, and Thai flavours.While discussing the event’s highlights, Mondal said, “The celebration presents a unique opportunity for guests to indulge in a diverse range of trout-based dishes, something they wouldn’t typically have the chance to experience elsewhere.” \nI can vividly remember my first encounter with baking when I was 10 years old. We had just moved to our new home and got a cable connection. The cable opened a world of possibilities, as it gave me access to various contents.This was back in the late 2000s when YouTube would take hours to load, taunting us with its buffering screen. I was particularly drawn to travel and lifestyle channels, mainly TLC, Fox Life, and Food Network, which kept me informed about different foods and cultures. I don’t know why, but I was always drawn to desserts. It was fascinating to see how these miraculous treats made people smile at the end of the meal.Growing up in Nepal, I noticed that baking wasn't very common. While some families did have ovens, they were mostly multifunctional ones used primarily for heating food.I also noticed that most of our desserts didn't require an oven, as they could be made on a stovetop. So, you can imagine my excitement when my mom decided to buy an oven during one of her festive shopping sprees.I could finally feel the joy these channels portrayed. (I blame food writer Nigella Lawson for getting me hooked on a domestic lifestyle.) Then, one day, after watching one of the cooking episodes on television, I finally mustered enough strength and decided to bake something. I distinctly remember wanting to make a chocolate cake for myself after watching one of Rachel Allen’s bake series. I watched all the ingredients used in that recipe and scurried across my pantry, only to realise I didn’t have half of the stuff she mentioned. I then decided to improvise the recipe (a big mistake). I randomly combined the ingredients that I had in a mixing bowl and chucked the batter into my oven, hoping for a magical cake to pop out an hour later.After I saw the result an hour later, I was mortified. The cake was stuck in the pan, refusing to come out, and it was as dense as fudge. I convinced myself that the taste was what mattered most, but when I served a slice to my brother, he made a face of utter disgust.That was the day I realised that baking soda was not the same as baking powder.After this incident, I researched baking and found out it was technical. This was a blessing in disguise for me, as I loved science, and I started to view baking as a science experiment. I then reflected and evaluated how to perfect one's baking skills.I analysed my errors and noted down all the steps I did every time I baked. Home baking is a passion for many. The idea of turning a few simple ingredients into a delicious masterpiece is as enchanting as it sounds.Yet, for many of us, this seemingly magical process can often turn into a series of unfortunate events, leading to crumbled dreams and deflated ambitions. Dense cakes, burnt crusts, rock-hard cookies and unrisen bread, if you are an amateur baker, then you have seen it all. But why do these mishaps happen so often? And most importantly how do we overcome them?From my experience, behind every successful bake lies a series of challenges and mishaps that test even the most dedicated bakers. Baking has its own set of rules that you need to follow to get that scrumptious treat every time. So, to transform a recipe into an actual dish that will impress your friends and family, I am sharing with you some of the tips and tricks I learned from my tumultuous journey as a home baker.First things first, we have to look into the prime appliance that we are working with. Commercial ovens are of two types: one that runs on gas and the other that runs on electricity. We have to look at the oven present at our home and consider its pros and cons. The main benefits of a gas oven are its size and temperature control. One can quickly change the temperature just by twisting the knob, and it preheats much more quickly than an electric one. However, they are known to have uneven temperatures at times and release more humidity, making it harder to properly crisp or brown food. This can result in burnt edges and cold or hot spots. An electric oven, on the other hand, provides more even and consistent temperatures and doesn’t release as much moisture in the air.This dry oven environment makes it easier to brown your items, making it great for baking bread. However, while the dry oven results in more even cooking, you also run the risk of drying out cakes and other baked goods.Also, many people forget to preheat the oven before baking, which is crucial for maintaining an even temperature throughout the baking process. When baking cakes and bread, I like to place a small tray of water at the bottom of the oven to provide moisture and prevent the baked goods from drying out.An oven thermometer can be a baker's best friend, providing a true reading and ensuring your creations bake evenly. I also like rotating the pan midway while baking, as it allows for an even distribution of heat.The next thing people mess up on is measuring and the specificity of ingredients in a recipe. Our moms made our food with their instinct; it is something that they learned along the way, but when you are baking, you cannot instinctively add or omit a few steps.I think that is why we initially had problems with baking. In a culture where cooking comes instinctually, baking challenges us, to be precise. A gram of more or less of any ingredient can drastically alter the outcome. Different methods of measuring flour can yield different results.Every component in baking serves a distinct purpose and function. Flour offers structure, sugar adds sweetness and moisture, eggs bind things together, and butter enhances taste and texture. However, not all ingredients are created equally. For example, using salted butter instead of unsalted might change the taste profile of your meal.Similarly, different flours have varying protein concentrations, which affect the texture of baked goods. The type of sugar used also makes a difference. Granulated sugar, brown sugar, powdered sugar, and speciality sugars like turbinado or muscovado each add unique flavours to a bake.Understanding these nuances and how they interact is critical for getting the intended outcomes. Accurate measurement tools and techniques are essential, but mastering them can be a steep learning curve. So, I would recommend investing in a kitchen scale that allows for more accurate measurements by weight rather than volume.Moving on, leavening agents such as baking soda, baking powder, and yeast are required to make baked goods rise. However, they can also cause confusion and errors. Baking soda needs an acidic component to activate, but baking powder has both an acid and a base, making it self-activating.Using the wrong type of flour or sugar, or using them in incorrect proportions, can result in flat, overly raised, or collapsed cakes. Yeast, being a living organism, presents its challenges.The water temperature must be just right—not too hot to kill the yeast, nor too cold to inhibit its activity. Proofing times and conditions also need to be carefully managed to achieve the perfect rise.Bakers should also be careful about the way they mix ingredients. The method of mixing ingredients can significantly impact the final product. Over-mixing can develop too much gluten in cakes and pastries, leading to tough textures.Under-mixing can leave pockets of unincorporated ingredients, resulting in uneven bakes. Techniques like folding, creaming, and whipping each serve specific purposes and must be executed with care.Finally, home bakers must understand the importance of timing and patience in baking. Even a minute or two can make the difference between perfectly baked cookies and burnt edges.Recipes often provide a range for baking times, but factors like oven hot spots, pan material, and altitude can affect these times. It’s crucial to keep a close eye on your bakes and rely on visual and tactile cues, such as a cake pulling away from the sides of the pan or a toothpick coming out clean, to determine doneness.Baking is also an exercise in patience, a virtue not everyone possesses. Doughs need time to rest and rise, flavours need time to meld, and baked goods need time to cool before they can be enjoyed.Impatience can lead to underbaked centres, crumbling slices, and a general sense of frustration. Cultivating patience is as important as mastering any technique in the baker’s repertoire.Home baking is a journey full of ups and downs, but it comes with great rewards. The obstacles encountered teach valuable lessons in patience, precision, and perseverance.The satisfaction of success, the freedom to create, and the therapeutic benefits make the endeavour meaningful. Whether baking for oneself, loved ones, or as an artistic outlet, the journey is as fulfilling as the result. Embrace the flour-dusted countertops, occasional setbacks, and the joys of home bakingFor a beginner-friendly recipe that involves mixing ingredients and delivers amazing results, try my recipe for fudgy, nutty brownies that I call ‘Bliss Brownies’.Bliss Brownies150g unsalted butter plus extra for the tin150g chopped dark chocolate200g caster sugar½ tsp baking powder2 eggs80g cocoa powder150g plain flour70g mixture of nuts (walnuts and almonds)60g blended papayaMix all the ingredients (except the dark chocolate and nuts) in a blender or a food processor and blitz till you get a smooth paste.Fold the chocolate and the nuts into the brownie batter, making sure that the pieces are evenly mixed in.Grease a loaf pan with soft butter and dust with cocoa powder. Pour the batter into the loaf pan.Bake in a preheated oven at 170c for 40 minutes and let it cool in the oven for an hour. Enjoy with a cup of coffee or, as I like it, a scoop of vanilla ice cream. \nIn a world where acceptance and safety often seem difficult to attain, many queer individuals also struggle to find a safe space to express themselves. They have to hide their true self and face relentless judgement when going to public places like cafes and restaurants.This is the reality for countless LGBTQIA+ individuals. The need for a safe space for this community is not just a desire but a necessity—a space where one can be themselves. This struggle for safety and acceptance can be traced to crucial historical moments, such as the Stonewall Riots of 1969 in New York City.The Stonewall Inn was more than a bar; it was a refuge for the queer community. When police raided the bar, the community fought back. This series of violent confrontations, which began in the early hours of June 28, 1969, between police and gay rights activists, marked the beginning of the modern LGBTQIA+ rights movement. The spirit of Stonewall, the fight for dignity and the right to exist openly lives on in places like Inclusive Galaxy Restaurant in Kathmandu. Inclusive Galaxy beyond a restaurant is an ‘oasis’ for the queer community and beyond.Founded by Bishwaraj Adhikari, Mr Gay Handsome Nepal 2013, a human rights defender, the restaurant proves the power of safe spaces. It’s a place where the community can unite, free from the prejudice and hostility that often permeate their everyday lives.After years of working in the human rights sector, Adhikari and his partner developed the idea for Inclusive Galaxy. What began as a small cafe gradually evolved into a full-fledged restaurant, driven by the growing demand and support from the community.“In developed countries with strong LGBTQIA+ movements, you can find community areas like gay villages. These are created as safe spaces for people whose families and communities have excluded them. They also support new business ideas and pink tourism. I hope to see pink tourism develop in Nepal someday,” says Adhikari. His vision for Inclusive Galaxy goes beyond just being a restaurant. He aims to promote financial independence and empowerment within the queer community.Since its inception in February 2019, Inclusive Galaxy has become a key spot for many in Lazimpat, a relatively queer-friendly area in Kathmandu. The location is essential because the first LGBTQIA+ movement in Nepal started in 2001 through the Blue Diamond Society.Inclusive Galaxy, true to its name, welcomes everyone—queer and non-queer alike—to share a comfortable space. His vision was clear: to create a space where people of all genders and sexual identities could come together without fear of exclusion.“I didn’t want to make it exclusively for queer people because that would be excluding ourselves from society. Different groups need to live together and understand each other,” Adhikari explains.In the early days, the cafe attracted both queer and non-queer customers. However, when some of the residents learned about Adhikari’s identity and the nature of the clientele, there was a brief period of hesitation. “At first, I didn’t understand what was happening, but then I realised my identity was an issue for a few people. I believe people should be judged by others by their character, not by their gender or sexuality. Over time, as residents saw that we operated like any other cafe, they became more comfortable,” Adhikari reflects.Adhikari started Inclusive Galaxy to give queer individuals a place to be proud of themselves, counteracting the self-doubt and insecurity that hiding one’s identity can cause. This turned the cafe very quickly into a community hub. The journey was not without challenges, though. It was difficult to hire staff and cooks from the LGBTQIA+ community, and soon after the restaurant opened, the COVID pandemic made things even harder.Despite these difficulties, the doors of Inclusive Galaxy remained open. During the pandemic, many queer individuals, who were abandoned by their families or afraid to return home, found comfort at Inclusive Galaxy.Since many couldn’t afford to pay for meals, the restaurant provided free food from its resources. As the number of people needing meals grew to 20-30 daily, Adhikari started raising funds within the community.“During my time as an activist, many people came here not only for food but also to see an organisation where the queer community supports one another,” Adhikari says.“The time during COVID was difficult, but it brought me closer to the community.”Four years after its inception, the restaurant has garnered a loyal following. Sarosy Neupane, Miss Pink Nepal 2024 first runner-up, describes Inclusive Galaxy as her second home. She moved to Kathmandu to study in 2022. Being distant from her family, she started visiting Galaxy for meals that reminded her of home-cooked food. Over time, she grew attached to the café because of its welcoming atmosphere.“It’s heartwarming to see people from our community and different walks of life here. The founders even invite us to festivals like ‘Dahi Chiura Khane din,’” she shares.Neupane visits the cafe regularly and sometimes stays until 3 am, engrossed in conversations. “I hope more spaces like this can open in the future. If, unfortunately, this place were to close someday, I don’t think we’d have any other place to turn to,” she adds.Muna Chhetri, a trans woman who has been a loyal customer for three years, shares, “This is my safe space where I can truly be myself. I always feel judged in other restaurants, but that fear doesn’t exist here. It’s where even those who aren’t accepted at home can feel accepted.”Sahara Khadka Chhetri, owner of Pink Tiffany, Kathmandu’s first openly LGBTIQIA+ friendly restaurant and bar, frequently visits after managing the bar, appreciating the convenience of not cooking at home.She notes very few places like this cater to our community, and some even had to close during COVID. “As an entrepreneur, I know that sustaining these spaces is a challenge. But as more spaces like these open, they will make the way for a more inclusive and compassionate society.”The welcoming atmosphere at Inclusive Galaxy has also had a surprising effect on non-queer patrons. Samriddha Jung Rana, a twenty-year-old neighbour who identifies as straight, often visits the café and appreciates the importance of such spaces.“Previously, I didn’t know much about the queer community and didn’t care much. But now, coming into this café, I’ve been interested in their rights and issues. I’ve realised that we’re not so different after all. We are all human,” he remarks.The ventures like Inclusive Galaxy and Pink Tiffany have inspired hope for collaborative businesses between queer and non-queer groups. The recent initiative by the Nepal Tourism Board promoting Pink Tourism in April 2024 is a positive step. Still, Adhikari believes that more support is needed from the government and the private sector.Despite the progress, challenges remain. However, Adhikari remains optimistic about the future. He is working on plans to develop the restaurant into a homestay program in the future.“Like how different planets, asteroids, and stars make up a beautiful galaxy, people from all walks of life and identities make a beautiful society. I am happy that we are assimilating together in this space. We are not so different; we are all different and similar simultaneously,” he says. \nNepali chef Aditya Mishra established \"The Sewing Tin\" to elevate Nepali cuisine in New York, leveraging his Michelin-starred training and showcasing his signature dish, Confit Duck Chatamari, a fusion of traditional Nepali and modern culinary techniques.\nCeleus Baral, an aspiring baker, runs Bakeleus, an online bakery specializing in eco-friendly, homegrown pastries, showcasing her artistry and commitment to sustainability through handcrafted treats and recipes.\nKhokana, a village near Kathmandu, boasts historical architecture, temples (Sikali Temple), mustard oil mills, and the Sikali Jatra festival, while preserving its traditional lifestyle despite urban expansion.\nNature's challenges and personal growth collide on a transformative journey to Everest Base Camp, inspiring resilience, self-discovery, and appreciation for life's fragility and beauty.\nA group of journalists embarked on a five-day tour across Sri Lanka, covering historical and religious sites, including the Pidurangala Rock, Temple of the Tooth Relic, and Galle Fort, while also exploring the country's natural beauty, tea estates, and tourism industry potential.\nMundhum Trek in Koshi province in the eastern part of Nepal is a new cultural walking trail. It passes through several indigenous ethnic villages and landscapes in Khotang and Bhojpur districts. This trail goes up to an elevation of 4,200 metres to the viewpoint of Silchung Peak and takes one through the settlements of the Kirati people. This route starts from Diktel Bazaar and passes through beautiful settlements like Chakhewa, Rawa Dhap, Salpa Bhanjyang, Silchung and Hanspokhari before ending in Bhojpur. There are some hotels in Diktel but trekkers are advised to carry tents. The trail offers panoramic views of most of the eight-thousanders, including Everest, Lhotse, Makalu, Cho Oyu and Kanchenjunga mountains. The spring season, March through May, is highly recommended for the trek.Janaki Mandir Janaki Mandir at Janakpur in Madhesh province was constructed in 1874 and is a blend of Mughal and local architecture. The temple is a three-storey building and has 60 rooms, making it the largest temple in Nepal. Pilgrims flock here by the thousands to pay homage to Janaki Mandir—Janaki being the other name of Sita, the daughter of King Janak. The temple houses an idol of Sita which was found near Ayodhya, the kingdom of Ram. The marriage anniversary of Lord Ram and Sita is celebrated in Janakpur every year on Vivaha Panchami, which falls in December. In the southwest corner of Janaki Mandir is the Vivaha Mandap, which has been built at the site where the marriage of Ram and Sita is said to have taken place. Another well-known temple in the vicinity is Ram Mandir, which is built in pagoda style and is hence different from the other temples in Janakpur that generally bear resemblance to Mughal architecture. It houses a female statue, said to be of Yogamaya, which has the reputation of being one of the most beautiful images of female forms in Nepal. Other holy sites of interest include the Laxman Temple, Sankat Mochan Temple and Hanuman Temple.Kuri Village, Kalinchok Kuri village, a popular tourist destination around 150 km from Kathmandu, lies at an altitude of 3,842 metres above sea level in Kalinchowk of Dolakha district, in Bagmati province. People visit the place to enjoy the snow during the winter besides the mesmerising landscapes and splendid panoramic view of the Himalayan range. Kalinchok gets snow mainly at the end of December and the snowfall continues till the end of February or mid-March. When there is snow, it is difficult for jeeps, buses and cars to reach the top of Kuri village. Chains are wrapped around the wheels of vehicles and specially modified jeeps with highly experienced drivers are used to carry visitors. There are several hotels and restaurants in the area. The road up to Kuri has also improved over the years.Annapurna Base Camp Annapurna Base Camp trek, in Gandaki province, makes for a picturesque journey that takes you to the foothills of the Annapurna South, up to 4,130 metres above sea level. The five-day trek (seven days for slow walkers) offers rich cultural diversities, typical Nepali villages and the flora and fauna nestled at the foothills of Annapurna. The distance from Pokhara to Annapurna Base Camp is approximately 81 kilometres. It is among the shortest and most budget-friendly treks in Nepal. For Nepalis, lodging costs around $5 to $10 per day. For foreigners, the overall cost of the trek ranges from $800 to $1500 on average per person. Annapurna Base Camp trek can be done at any time throughout the year as each season offers a different trekking experience. The ideal time for the trek depends on your weather preferences and what you expect from it. However, autumn (September to October) and spring (March to May) are considered the two best seasons for the trek, as the days at the time are warm and bright with clear skies.Bardiya National Park Bardiya National Park, located in the southern Tarai belt of Lumbini province, is home to one of the most elusive and majestic animals on earth—the Royal Bengal Tiger. The park, which covers an area of 968 square kilometres, is considered one of the most important protected areas in the country. It is a prime destination for those looking to catch a glimpse of a tiger. A bit of luck and patience will offer a good chance to see the Bengal Tiger. The jungle safari also offers one the opportunity to spot Asian elephants and the greater one-horned rhinoceros. The rare Gangetic river dolphins are occasionally spotted on rafting trips along the Geruwa River, the eastern channel of the Karnali river. Besides, visitors can enjoy the homestays and explore local Tharu culture. The right time to visit the park is from mid-September to mid-December and mid-February to May.Khaptad National Park Khaptad National Park in Sudurpaschim province is a protected area in the far western region. It stretches over four districts of Bajhang, Bajura, Achham and Doti and ranges in elevation from 1,400 to 3,300 metres. The park can be visited throughout the year. Trekkers are advised to bring their tents, food and other supplies. The Nepal Tourism Board says of late, social media has been increasingly influencing Nepali travellers to go to Khaptad. Since the far-flung Khaptad National Park is still offbeat for many travellers, the area remains pristine and fresh. The seasons of spring (March-May) and autumn (October-November) are the ideal times to visit the park. The temperature ranges from 10°c to 20°c offering pleasant trekking weather. The monsoon begins in June and lasts until September and during this time, roads often become muddy and slippery. From December to February, winter brings snow and chilling winds to the park.Limi Valley \nOnce again, my heart swelled with joy when my hometown came into view.Arriving at Lalikharka after the treacherous journey through Pauwa Bhanjyang and the bustling Kanchhi Dokan, Phidim, the headquarters of Panchthar district, revealed itself like a surprise gift. My home town, Phidim, is unique in the fact that it reveals to travellers approaching it from uphill. As the vehicle descends the mountain road, it slowly comes into view, its houses and buildings recognisable for the native son.This Dashain, I undertook the much-awaited trip to my hometown with my wife Kabita and daughter Aarohi. Little did I anticipate the transformation that awaited me.The moment I got out of the jeep, I noticed that Phidim, nestled in the lush hills, has undergone a remarkable transformation over the years. As I guided my family to my home, which had suffered damages in the 1989 quake that struck eastern Nepal, I found that old, mud and stone houses had been replaced by concrete buildings. The place was vastly different from the one I remembered.Arriving at my childhood home felt like reuniting with an old friend. Navigating its nooks and crannies with my daughter, we delved into the history of the house, a symbol of my cherished memories.My wife had visited Phidim years ago, spending a month with my parents. She, too, recalled beautiful moments she had had in the town. I asked the tenant about the neighbours and acquaintances. Some had died, while others had left for good.A call to local journalist Giriraj Banskota led me to the school grounds, where memories flooded back. This was where I spent my teenage years, playing ball, learning to kick, and watching major tournaments. Here, I even encountered a group of Western climbers headed to Kanchenjunga, the world’s third-highest mountain. I remember being awed by their shiny yellow tents, headlights and strange smell. I remember practising my tutephuteko Angrezi with the climbers. Birendra Shield, an annual sports tournament named after the late king, brought ace players from various schools in Panchthar district. The district also hosted Yuba Mela, an annual three-day fair to commemorate the birthday of the king, organising football tournaments in which teams from as far as Sunsari and Taplejung participated. I never excelled at dribbling balls. A boy growing up in a seven-member family, I soon found my interest in literature. In the late 1980s, Phidim hosted a major literary festival. In the run-up to the 1990 pro-democracy protest, walls were painted with anti-monarchy slogans, local politicians were arrested. I took my family to my school, Naya Namuna Secondary School. It was Saturday, so the school was closed. I peeked through the steel gate and wall, imagining myself labouring over classes. Memories are hazy, but what I remember most is going out of the school—to quiz contests with me leading the school team, to essay competitions at the District Education Office and to play carom board, a national pastime, in a nearby shopfront. Returning to the main street, the demolition of a landmark gate made me reflect on how cities transform, shedding old landmarks for new identities. Navigating narrow alleyways, I felt like a stranger in my own hometown. Multistory buildings have emerged and roads have been paved, reshaping the town. It’s the same place with a different face, leaving me nostalgic for the Phidim of my memories.We finally reached Shivalaya temple, which I told my wife and daughter was one of my cherished hangouts. A giant statue of Falgunanda (the Kirant leader’s birthday is celebrated on November 10) stood before the steps to the temple. Though my wife suspected I came here to smoke, in reality, I visited the temple in the evening to meet friends and talk about issues that mattered most to us at the time. It also offered a panoramic view of the town (I could not take my family to Gadhi Danda, a hillock across the Shivalaya).Towards the end of my journey, I felt sad about Phidim’s lack of prospects. To my dismay, I found that people have been leaving the town in droves. Despite blacktopped roads and multi-story buildings, Phidim faces a troubling reality. The lack of quality higher education and specialist healthcare has driven people away, echoing the circumstances that led me to Kathmandu years ago. Conversations with locals confirmed a mass exodus from the town, a trend that raises concerns about Phidim's future.My conversations with familiar strangers led me to conclude that Phidim has transformed into a transit town for pilgrims heading to Pathibhara Devi Temple, which is around 255 kilometres north in Taplejung district. I met dozens of people headed to the holy site. While pilgrims see it as a stopover, for me, it was a homecoming. The realisation dawned that Phidim is, perhaps, in a state of transition, trading its rustic charm for the hallmarks of urbanisation. While I left Phidim for higher education in Kathmandu, people from rural areas have flocked to the town in search of better opportunities, bringing life and energy to the once quiet community.As we bid adieu to my hometown, I couldn’t help but reflect on the inevitability of leaving a place, no matter how enamoured one is with it. Passing Kanchhi Dokan, I pointed out Kanchnajungha and Kumbhakarna to my daughter—symbols of my childhood. Phidim, now a blend of nostalgia and change, remains etched in my heart, a testament to the intricate dance between memory and evolution. \nToran Bikram Shahi took the lead after the first round as Surya Nepal Central Open, the first event under Surya Nepal Golf Tour 2024-25, kicked off at the par-72 Gokarna Golf Club on Monday.Shahi carded 5-under 67 to remain at the top of the leaderboard. He is one stroke ahead of Nepal number one pro Bhuvan Nagarkoti and Sunil KC. Nagarkoti and KC carded 4-under 68 each.

They set a formidable target of 229 runs for Afghanistan. However, Afghanistan could only manage 120 runs for the loss of nine wickets.Nepal’s vice-captain Padam Bahadur Badaila and Naresh Chaudhary played stellar innings, both scoring half-centuries. Badaila remained unbeaten with 92 runs off 51 balls, while Chaudhary scored an unbeaten 72 runs off 62 balls. Bharat Thapa contributed 21 runs, and Sagar Lama added 4 runs. Afghanistan’s bowlers gave away 39 extra runs, boosting Nepal’s total.In response, Afghanistan’s Abaseen scored 52, Dwaran managed 21, and Sharafat added 13 runs. Nepal’s Sunil Rana Magar took three wickets, while Bharat Thapa, Amish Guragai, and Sunil Subedi Chhetri claimed one wicket each.Nepal are scheduled to play South Africa in their fourth match on Tuesday. Earlier, Nepal faced defeats against Sri Lanka in their first match and Bangladesh in their second. The tournament features six teams: Nepal, India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, and South Africa. \nRussian forces are making rapid gains in Ukraine, capturing an area half the size of London in the past month, including territory in the Donetsk region and the towns of Pokrovsk and Kurakhove.\nIsrael and Iran-backed Hezbollah looked set to reach a ceasefire deal on Tuesday, Israeli and Lebanese officials said, clearing the way for an end to the conflict that has killed thousands of people since it was ignited by the Gaza war 14 months ago.A senior Israeli official and Lebanese Foreign Minister Abdallah Bou Habib appeared optimistic that a deal could be reached, cooling a second front for Israel's military that is also battling the Palestinian militant group Hamas in Gaza.Israel’s security cabinet is expected to convene later on Tuesday to likely approve a text at a meeting chaired by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, a senior Israeli official said.This would pave the way for a ceasefire declaration by US President Joe Biden and French President Emmanuel Macron, four senior Lebanese sources told Reuters on Monday.At a conference in Rome, Lebanese Foreign Minister Abdallah Bou Habib expressed hope that a deal to end the deadliest spillover from the Gaza war could be sealed by Tuesday night.The agreement requires Israeli troops to withdraw from south Lebanon and Lebanon’s army to deploy in the region - a Hezbollah stronghold - within 60 days, officials say. Hezbollah would end its armed presence along the border south of the Litani River.Bou Habib said the Lebanese army would be ready to have at least 5,000 troops deployed in southern Lebanon as Israeli troops withdraw, and that the United States could play a role in rebuilding infrastructure destroyed by Israeli strikes.Brokered by the US and France, Israel has all security concerns.Israel demands effective UN enforcement of an eventual ceasefire with Lebanon and will show “zero tolerance” toward any infraction, Defence Minister Israel Katz said on Tuesday.The agreement with Lebanon will maintain Israel’s freedom of operation there to act in defence to remove threats posed by Hezbollah and enable displaced residents to return safely to their homes in northern Israel, Israeli government spokesperson David Mencer told Reuters.Signs of a diplomatic breakthrough have been accompanied by a military escalation. Israeli airstrikes on Tuesday demolished more of Beirut’s Hezbollah-controlled southern suburbs, while the armed group has kept up rocket fire into Israel.The UN rights chief voiced concern about the escalation of hostilities in Lebanon, where his office said nearly 100 people had been reported killed by Israeli airstrikes in recent days, including women, children and medics.Israel says it targets military capabilities in Lebanon and Gaza and takes steps to mitigate the risk of harm to civilians. It accuses Hezbollah, like Hamas in Gaza, of hiding among civilians, which they deny.‘The Missiles are Chasing Us’Israel has dealt Hezbollah massive blows since going on the offensive against the group in September, killing its leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah and other top commanders, and pounding areas of Lebanon where the group holds sway.“Regarding the ceasefire, I think it will be implemented. Both sides are tired - both sides are tired,” said Selim Ayoub, a 37-year-old mechanic from Beirut’s southern suburbs.Hezbollah launched some 250 rockets on Sunday in one of its heaviest barrages yet. The northern Israeli city of Nahariya came under more rocket fire overnight.Diplomacy to end the fighting has focused on restoring a ceasefire based on UN Security Council Resolution 1701, which ended the last major war between Hezbollah and Israel in 2006.Israel’s ambassador to the United Nations, Danny Danon, said on Monday that Israel would maintain the ability to strike southern Lebanon under any agreement.Lebanon has previously objected to Israel being granted such a right, and Lebanese officials have said such language is not included in the draft proposal.Two Israeli officials told Reuters that Israel has a side agreement with the US allowing it to take action in Lebanon against “imminent threats.”Hezbollah, seen as a terrorist group by Washington, has endorsed its ally Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri to negotiate.Death and DestructionOver the past year, more than 3,750 people have been killed in Lebanon and over one million have been forced from their homes, according to Lebanon’s health ministry, which does not distinguish between civilians and combatants in its figures.The widespread destruction left by Israeli airstrikes has brought into focus a huge reconstruction bill awaiting cash-strapped Lebanon, with many left homeless heading into winter.Hezbollah strikes have killed 45 civilians in northern Israel and the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights. At least 73 Israeli soldiers have been killed in northern Israel, the Golan Heights and in combat in southern Lebanon, according to Israeli authorities.A ceasefire would pave the way for 60,000 people to return to homes in northern Israel, which they evacuated as Hezbollah began firing rockets in support of its Palestinian ally Hamas a day after that group's October 7, 2023 assault. \nPrince Harry and other high-profile British figures’ privacy lawsuits against the Daily Mail newspaper’s publisher will go to trial in early 2026, London’s High Court heard on Tuesday, with the parties’ legal costs set to exceed 38 million pounds ($47.8 million).Harry, the younger son of King Charles, is one of seven claimants suing Associated Newspapers over allegations of voicemail interception – commonly known as phone-hacking – and other serious privacy breaches dating back 30 years.Associated, which also publishes the Mail on Sunday, has always denied involvement in unlawful practices. Its lawyers said in filings for a preliminary hearing on Tuesday that the claimants’ allegations were “firmly denied”.The publisher’s attempt to throw out the lawsuits was rejected last year, paving the way for a trial which the claimants and Associated say should begin in early 2026.Lawyers representing the claimants, who also include singer Elton John and actors Elizabeth Hurley and Sadie Frost, expect to spend around 18.4 million pounds up to and including the trial, with Associated incurring nearly 20 million pounds, according to court filings made public on Tuesday.Harry and the other claimants’ lawsuits, which were filed in 2022, marked the first time Associated had been dragged into the phone-hacking scandal, which emerged more than a decade ago and prompted a public inquiry into the ethics of the press and several criminal trials.It also sparked long-running litigation against Rupert Murdoch’s British newspaper arm, News Group Newspapers, and the publisher of the Daily Mirror, Mirror Group Newspapers (MGN).Harry’s case against Associated is one of several he has brought against British media organisations as part of his “mission” to purge executives and editors whom he accuses of spreading lies and intruding into people’s lives.The prince accepted substantial damages from MGN to settle the remainder of his phone-hacking lawsuit, having been awarded 140,600 pounds (around $178,000) after the High Court ruled he had been targeted by journalists.Harry’s case against News Group Newspapers is due to go to trial in January. \nAn ethnic minority army that is part of a formidable rebel alliance fighting Myanmar’s ruling military has announced its willingness to hold talks with the junta after a year-long battle along the Myanmar-China border.The Ta’ang National Liberation Army’s (TNLA) decision, announced late on Monday, comes as powerful neighbour China puts pressure on rebels amid the rapid degeneration of the military, which Beijing has long seen as a guarantor of stability.Myanmar has been in turmoil since the military ousted an elected government led by democracy icon Aung San Suu Kyi in 2021, sparking a resistance movement that began as peaceful protests and later evolved into an armed rebellion on multiple fronts.The TNLA in a statement on its official Telegram channel said it wanted a halt to the military’s air strikes in its region of northern Shan state and expressed its desire for talks and its appreciation for China's mediation effort.“Our civilians are suffering from air strikes and other difficulties. So, we need to find a way out,\" TNLA spokesperson Lway Yay Oo said.The TNLA is part of a coordinated offensive launched last year called \"Operation 1027,\" named after its start date, which has become the biggest challenge to Myanmar’s generals since their coup, resulting in their loss of several towns and military posts.The other two groups in the alliance, the Arakan Army and the Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army, did not immediately respond to requests for comment.China’s foreign ministry on Tuesday said Beijing opposes any outbreak of war and chaos in Myanmar and urged all parties to cease fighting and resolve conflicts through dialogue.\"China will continue to actively promote peace talks and provide support and assistance to the best of its ability to the peace process in northern Myanmar,\" spokesperson” Mao Ning said at a regular news briefing.The rebel alliance had previously reached a ceasefire in January with Myanmar’s military during China-mediated talks, but the deal collapsed in June and fighting resumed.A spokesperson for Myanmar’s junta did not answer calls from Reuters.Myanmar’s parallel administration, the National Unity Government (NUG), said Beijing must consider the desires of Myanmar’s people when getting involved in the country’s crisis.“I want to encourage China not to conduct meetings which go against the will of Myanmar people as they will not be helpful to the country’s peace,” said its spokesperson Kyaw Zaw. \nChaaaiiittt…The spontaneous eruption of the sound of victory thundered through the neighbourhood of Nhyokha in the Kathmandu core. The line of a kite cut another. Looking out the window of her house, Sajani Shrestha saw children running full speed, shouting and fighting as they vied to catch the falling kite and thread. And craning her neck up to the sky, she could not count but only be mesmerised by the innumerable kites strewn across the skies of Nhyokha, Bangemudha, Indrachowk. “There would be so many kites that they entirely covered the blue of the sky, making beautiful patterns of different colours,” says the 51-year-old. “And you cannot imagine the number of times the call of chait rang in the air.”Clear blue sky and gentle westerlies, the season of kites has arrived in the Kathmandu Valley. While kites soared Kathmandu's sky mainly during Dashain, the kite season officially started in Nag Panchami (August) and ended on the Haribodhini Ekadashi (November). And from royalities to commoners, young and old all flew kites from rooftops and open grounds. Even those who did not, like Sajani, revelled in the live spectacle in the sky as kites soared and fought. With Bhimsen Thapa’s help, King Girvanyuddha flies kites The earliest written account of kite flying is believed to date to 200 BC in China. In Kathmandu, this tradition has religious and socio-cultural and environmental significance, says Tina Manandhar, lecturer of Nepalese History, Culture and Archaeology at Tribhuvan University. According to her, it is believed that kites in Kathmandu skies carry a message to the god of rain Indra that the valley's farmers have had enough rain for their crops. That is why Kathmandu farmers scolded anyone flying kites before plantation season.In an article ‘Changako Utpati Ra Bikas’ published in Gorkhapatra in 1995, historian Rajesh Gautam points to the lack of written documents indicating the exact time when kite culture was introduced in Nepal. Exploring different opinions on kite's introduction to Nepal, he writes that “some have opined the possibility that the skill and tradition of kite flying might have entered Nepal through India.” Yet some others, he writes, state that kites “came to Nepal from Japan during the time of [Rana PM] Dev Shumsher.”He concludes that most likely this tradition was introduced by Malla-era Newar traders: “But since Nepal’s relationship with Tibet and China is very old and direct, kites might have entered Nepal through the Newar traders who were engaged in the trade. One can estimate that the kite was introduced to Nepal during the (mediaeval) Malla regime.”In Social History of Nepal, TR Vaidya, Tri Ratna Manandhar and Shankar Lal Joshi write that there exists documented evidence of the kite flying from the early 19th century. The authors state that Sundarananda, a contemporary poet, has mentioned that the young king Girvanyuddha Bikram Shah (r.1799-1816), with the help of Prime Minister Bhimsen Thapa, flew kites from the towering temple of Taleju Bhawani, Hanumandhoka. And when the king's kite cut the kites of the youngsters, they were located and rewarded with money.In Tyas Bakhatko Nepal, Sardar Bhim Bahadur Pandey states that “During the month of Kartik [October-November] young and old all flew kites,” suggesting that kite culture was ubiquitous in Kathmandu by the early twentieth century.Anticipations and preparationsKite flying in Nepal requires a kite, a lattai (a wooden spool), thread and majha (homemade adhesive prepared by boiling snail slime, rice or sago, and powdered glass from burnt electric bulbs and coated on the line to sharpen it for kite fighting).77-year-old Nirmal Man Tuladhar, an avid kite flyer and retired professor of Linguistics at the Tribhuvan University, explains how Nepali tradition of kite flying was both expensive and needing advance preparation.“In our times, it wasn’t easy to fly kites,” he says. “We had to prepare majha …And as Nepali kites are fighter kites, we mainly fought with other kites [which meant we spent a lot of threads].”This preparation needed first and foremost of passing a hurdle: securing finances and materials to fly kites. While lattai was a one-time investment that could be saved for years, kites and threads had to be replenished every time a kite was cut.“Those were the times when parents wanted us to be more focused in our studies. They only gave money [to buy kites] after immense pestering,” says 80-year-old Dwarika Nath Dhungel, former Secretary of Nepal government, speaking of the 1950s and 1960s.Biodiversity specialist and botanist Tirtha Bahadur Shrestha, 86, was born in Mahabouddha and began flying kites from 1951-52. He saved what little money he got for afternoon snacks to buy Hattimar reel, a brand of line wound in a small lattai, which was strong and sharp and where majha stuck well.Raghuji Pant, a member of parliament, also recalls the difficulty in securing money to sustain his kite flying in and around Kathmandu core in the 1960s and early 1970s. “Four to five of my kites were cut in a day,” writes the 67-year-old in his 2019 article “Changa Jastai Udi Hidne Man” published in Himalkhabar. “[This caused] the line in the spool to shorten. From Bhadra [August-September] to one to one and a half months after Dashain I spent flying kites. So, it was difficult for me to have enough kites even after getting money from grandfather, grandmother, mother and everyone.”Kites and thread secured, now began the crucial work of preparing and applying majha whose strength determined how well it cut other kites. Govinda Tandon, 70, a historian and heritage expert, who grew up in Battisputali, was also an ardent kite flyer.“Materials for making majha were prepared right from the morning on a holiday,\" he writes in his article “Dashainko Butte Changa” published in Gorkhapatra. “Because this work couldn’t be accomplished without a collaboration of 3-4 friends, a holiday was set aside for this. Moreover, a sunny day was considered appropriate. If the majha didn’t dry, the thread could turn moist, and so if it felt like the day wouldn’t be sunny, the entire plan…was aborted.”Kite makers, kite sellers and variety of kites One of the oldest shops in Kathmandu's memory, Shree Chitrakar Kite Center in Tyauda, Asan is bustling with customers during Dashain. “When my grandmother got married and came to this house at age 12 [in early 1940s], this shop was already here,” says its fourth generation owner 47-year-old Dinoj Chitrakar. “So the shop must be around a hundred years old.”Another shop that stands out in Kathmandu's memory is Manandhar Kite Center in Kalimati, established in 1949, and currently run by brothers Mohan Man and Sundar Man Manandhar.In his book Antar Taranga, artist and writer Manuj Babu Mishra recalls “a kite shop near the old halwai shop of Chabahil” in the 1940s. Dhungel and his 1960 batchmates of Juddhodaya Public School recall the kite shops from the 1950s and 1960s – Bekhacha’s Shop at Netapacho, Bhaicha’s Shop at Nhyokha, Lata Manandhar’s Shop at Maru, Kanchha Buddha Bajracharya Shop at Tyauda.Besides the shops, there were makers and sellers of kites cloistered in different localities of Kathmandu Valley.In Kwalkhu, Patan was a Joshi who made Nepali paper kites.“One day I accompanied my uncle to buy kites,\" writes Dibya Giri, 69, in his 2023 article “Changa” in Sahitya Post. “I was amazed to see the huge stacks of kites there. We used to call it the house of the kite maker.”In Nhyokha, Purna Bahadur Shrestha began making kites as a teenager and started his own kite business in the 1950s, according to his daughter Sajani.These kites, made out of Nepali paper, often had different paintings. Mishra recalls painting kites for the kite shop in Chabahil.“I went to that kite shop and with the freely available colours and Nepali papers, I spent my day painting faces, birds, animals, masks, mountains, hills, whatever came to my mind,” he writes in the book. “Such kites apparently sold well!”Most septuagenarians and older generations like Tuladhar and Tirtha Bahadur recall flying kites made of Nepali paper when young. Tirtha Bahadur says that kites from Lucknow began coming to Kathmandu only after the late 1950s. But at least a section of Kathmandu was flying kites from Lucknow from the early twentieth century. Vaidya, Manandhar and Joshi write that the Ranas and Shahs imported kites from Lucknow and that from them, their favourite employees also got to fly some. These kites were large and, in Tyas Bakhatko Nepal, Pande writes that they were referred to as Lucknowia kites.Known for their characteristic hissing sound they made while flying, light body, swift movement and ability to take sharp turns, Lucknow kites were preferred by kite fighters.“Lucknow kites were lighter and could be manoeuvred well,” says Tuladhar. “Kites of Nepali paper were stable but difficult to manoeuvre. They were also expensive. So only some fighters flew Nepali paper kites.”The kites had different names depending upon their designs and colours – Ambe (a heart in the centre), Dibdibe (chequered), Pakhete (a different coloured paper on one edge), Sete (white-coloured), Nilchi (blue-coloured), Rate (red-coloured) and so on.The kite fighters preferred the strong and sharp Hattimar reel that came on a small lattai. The Belchamar reel was cheaper but weaker and prone to be cut by other threads. Kite fliers and kite watchers on rooftops and open groundsBibek Shrestha, 57, and his two brothers took stacks of kites and climbed their rooftops. The rooftops around theirs in the neighbourhood of Nhyokha – in fact in all core settlements of the Valley – were filled with kite fliers and spectators. Many risked precariously balancing on the sloped roofs.While Bibek and his brothers’ kites alighted to meet the sea of kites in the sky, their sister Sajani and other family members gathered around to revel in the live spectacle.Dhungel remembers the rooftops of Jhochhen and surroundings of the 1950s and 1960s swelled with kite fliers. Dhungel did try to fly kites. But he did not become a successful kite flyer. What he did become was, like Sajani and many Kathmandu residents, an admirer of kites soaring in the sky.“But more than engaging in my unsuccessful kite flying attempts, I enjoyed looking at the kites flying. There would be a big crowd of spectators. Females and other family members watched the kites fly as they ate meat and chiura. Some even drank and rejoiced as they flew kites.”When the age of cassette player and speakers dawned in the 1980s, songs blared from the speakers alongside kite flying. Chitrakar and Bibek invited their friends, put their favourite songs on speakers and spent entire afternoons flying kites, dancing, singing and eating.Away from the core cities, in the villages in the Valley, people flew kites in open fields. Like Dibya, who set his kite for flight from the banks of Godavari River in Tikathali. Chhauni was also a popular space for flying kites.Kathmandu’s joy in kite fightingBibek pulled his kite down and then manoeuvred it back up so his line touched his opponent's line from below and quickly reeled out his line. The resulting sharpness from the speed cut the opponent's line.Chaaaiiitttt………“The greatest fun comes from cutting another kite's string,” writes Tuladhar in his 1996 article “Cutting is the greatest fun” published in magazine Kite Lines. “With its coating of adhesive paste and ground glass, the string is as sharp and abrasive as sandpaper on your opponent's line.”Nepali kite, Tuladhar says, is made to fight other kites, and describes how a kite line cuts the other.“The technique is to touch your rival's string and immediately reel out line at high speed,” he writes. “The Nepalese style of kite flying is aggressive, and though the kites look simple, they are strategically designed for bringing down other kites.”At any given time, like Bibek’s kite above Nhyokha sky, skies above the Valley were filled with raging kites, swinging, coming down and going up as the fighters reeled in and out their lattais in ferocious attempts to bring down other kites.Meanwhile spectators cheered. “Even passersby stopped to look at the kites,” recalls Tina.The moment of a kite cutting was accompanied by the sound of chait, and children ran in the direction of the falling kite to grab it and the thread in what was termed as, Dibya says, changa lutne/dhago lutne.Dhungel always joined in to shout the chait resounding through the locality of Jhochhen and almost automatically his feet sped towards the severed kites' direction.“‘Oii leave that thread,’ the kite owner would scold me. ‘Why do you pull my thread, leave it right now.’ But I’d continue pulling the threads as the owner continued shouting. Other times I caught the kites that had failed to fly and dropped on the ground.”The fallen kites got stuck in the buildings, trees or poles, or glided down in the open grounds or paddy fields. Falling kites from the Kathmandu core settled down in Tundikhel covering it. Oftentimes kites fell on the fields to rest upon the lush paddy nearing its harvest.“Children ran straight into the fields to catch the kite,” says Dibya. \"They destroyed the crops by stepping on them. Some farmers chased them, scolding along as they did so and if they caught anyone, they slapped them.”Love and restrictions on kiteAmidst the raging kite fights high up in the sky, there were apparently also some quieter kites lingering much lower among the buildings or tree lines, for their goals lay in not ruthlessly cutting the threads of other kites but piercing softly through the hearts of their owners' love interests. During the Rana regime, there were designated public spaces to fly kites, writes Gautam in his article. Referring to oral accounts, he writes that the Ranas were particularly careful to avoid kite flyers around their durbars. This is because love-stricken men tied letters to kites and flew them into the durbars to their love interests among the nanis.He writes that the kites could be flown mainly on the grounds of Chhauni. Anyone flying kites in any other place and around Rana durbars were arrested.Pant also recalls love-stricken boys from his time. “Just as kites came in different colours and patterns, so did kite flyers,” he writes in the article. “Some wrote love letters using a few words in “symbolic language” on a plain kite and attempted to land it on the rooftop of the girl they liked. Some simply landed their kites on any rooftop if a girl appeared there and waited for reaction.”King Tribhuvan among kite fliersPande writes in his book: “Once or twice during kite season every year, King Tribhuvan went to Chhauni to fly kites. Legend has it that if the line of the king’s kite was cut, it flew to Lhasa. But since anyone who caught that kite received five rupees, everyone attempted to catch that kite.”In 2021 news report ‘Bhawanle Chhekidiyo Changa Udaune Aakash’ by Shivahari Ghimire published in Nayapatrika, cultural expert the late Satyamohan Joshi also recounts that “During Dashain, Tribhuvan came to the ground below Swayambhu to fly kites. […] He did not use the same thread to fly kites twice.”In the same article, Joshi says that the King also went to Budhanilakantha to fly kites and participate in kite flying competitions.End of season, end of cultureMohan Krishna Shrestha, 86, was born in Budhanilakantha. Every year, on the day of Haribodhini Ekadashi, he saw the annual fair at the Budhanilakantha Temple. He also witnessed kite fliers gathered in the open fields around the Temple.“Oh, it’d be a lot of people,” says Shrestha. “They came from all around Bhaktapur, Kathmandu and Lalitpur.”They flew kites on Ekadashi, Dwadashi and some even until Purnima.“They took all the remaining threads and kites that had survived Dashain and flew the last kites of the season,” says Tuladhar. “I remember my uncles, relatives and neighbours going to Budhanilakantha with their kites.”Joshi recalls in the 2021 article that King Tribhuvan also went to Budhanilakantha with his sons Mahendra, Himalaya and Basundhara. He greatly supported and also participated in the competitions there organised by the commoners. If he liked he gave prize money to the winners.This annual event lost its glory days after the decline in the open fields as buildings began to rise with the establishment of Budhanilkantha School in 1972, Mohan says.“The event survived in some form until the 1990s,” he says.But what happened after that?The end-of-the-season event in the 1990s was also an indication of the end of the age-old kite tradition.“If I go to my ancestral place in Asan to fly kites, it’s not possible for me to do that today because there are buildings everywhere,” says Tuladhar. “Cityscapes and urbanisation have created the obstacle for flying kites.”Dibya does feel like flying kites sometimes.“No space to fly kites today,” he says. “In the old times, there were river banks and open fields. Even if you fly kites, it gets stuck in somebody's rooftop or water tank or somewhere.”Yesteryear’s kite enthusiasts believe that increasing means of entertainment was another reason for the decline of kite culture.“When television came, kite flying started to slowly decrease,” says Bibek. “And then mobile phones robbed kite flying even more.”And so, when his sister Sajani cranes her neck up in the sky today, she rarely sees a kite.“Those days we heard one chait after another,” she says. “These days you won’t hear a single chait.” \nIn 2008 Matina Shakya was only three years old when she was appointed as the Kumari of Kathmandu. She was succeeded by Trishna Shakya as the new Kumari in 2017.Kumaris are revered as goddesses of beauty and strength in certain Hindu and Buddhist traditions. Worshipping young girls as Kumaris is a 2,000-year-old practice in Nepal. Since the 13th century, when the Malla kings ruled, the Newars of the Kathmandu Valley have been worshipping Kumari, a girl from the Shakya/Bajracharya community chosen to embody the divine energy of goddess Taleju Bhawani. The reign of a Kumari ends when she starts menstruating. So long as she is serving as the Kumari, she is believed to be the nation’s divine protector, safeguarding it from evil. Matina, 18, is now in her first year of college, studying for a bachelor’s degree in management. Her father, Pratapman Shakya, when asked about having a daughter who is the only living the goddess in the world said, “Not having your own daughter live in the same house as you seemed a little unfair, but we feel very proud to call ourselves the parents of the royal Kumari who is revered by people all over the world.”On March 9, 2023, he, along with Matina, were getting ready for a special function held to honour all former Kumaris from across Nepal. “There are often events to honour Matina as she was the royal Kumari, but this one was dedicated to all former Kumaris from different areas. There are 129 living Kumaris in all,” he added. Besides Kathmandu, Kumari tradition is followed in Bhaktapur, Lalitpur, and Kirtipur, among other cities.According to him, this was the first time an event like this was organised and the Deputy Mayor of Kathmandu, Sunita Dangol, was also in attendance.Throughout the year, many people line up outside the ‘Kumari Ghar’ to get a chance to visit the Kumari and get her blessings. Many foreigners stand out in the yard to catch a glimpse of her. Nepali people believe that if a Kumari smiles at you, it is a bad omen.Everyday, a tutor visits the Kumari to help her continue with her education as she is not allowed to step outside the Kumari Ghar. She takes her exams and does her homework from the Kumari Ghar itself. She also has the freedom to play inside the Kumari Ghar. Many former kumaris have pursued careers in their fields of interest or studied after their term ends, and they continue to be treated with the same respect. The tradition of Kumari has evolved over time. In the past Kumaris did not enjoy these freedoms.Because of various superstitious beliefs, Kumaris were not fully educated and were forbidden from getting married because of the belief that the groom would die soon if he married an ex-Kumari. They led secluded lives, were restricted from participating in normal childhood activities, and focused solely on their religious duties.However, now, these myths have been dispelled. Modern understanding has shifted to recognise that Kumaris, after stepping down from their divine role, have the freedom to marry and lead a normal life. The perception of Kumaris as isolated figures has evolved, with a focus on providing them with a more balanced upbringing. There have been initiatives to integrate Kumaris into regular social and educational settings, allowing them to have a more holistic and fulfilling childhood experience. “Matina was already familiar with the students from the school that she attended after her term as Kumari ended,” said Shakya. “The kids visited the Kumari Ghar frequently so that she could have a smooth transition,” he added. According to Gautam Prasad Shakya, who has been living as a caretaker in the Kumari Ghar, the changes made to the tradition are minor. “The traditions of Kumari have mostly stayed the same. All the rituals are still practised like in the old days,” he said.On 6 May 2005, Pun Devi Maharjan, a lawyer, filed a case in the Supreme Court claiming that the traditional practice of electing young girls as Kumaris, or “goddesses’, who are expected to follow certain social restrictions and appear at religious festivals, violated the rights of the child. Quoting Maharjan’s complaint, Puskar Mathema writes in Yuwamanch Monthly of October 2007, “If Kumari tradition is continued, it will undermine the fundamental rights as well the freedoms of children guaranteed by the constitution and child rights treaties. Apart from this, it will have a negative impact on their physical and mental development.”The case continued while Nepal overthrew the monarchy and declared itself a secular state in 2007. When the judgement was pronounced in 2008, the goddess was still in her role, now giving blessings to the country’s President. The court ordered that the Kumaris and ex-Kumaris receive better benefits and arrangements and ordered the government to improve their support and allowances.In April 2006, Prof Chunda Bajracharya filed a petition at the Supreme Court against Maharjan’s petition, who had argued against the Kumari tradition. Bajracharya contended that the tradition should be preserved as heritage due to its over 100 years of history.“People who don’t understand the culture shouldn’t comment on it,” she stated. Bajracharya also criticised the human right activists who contended that Kumaris were only allowed to wear the colour red. “People who say Kumaris are forced to wear red clothing all the time, are the same people who send their kids to schools in uniform,” she said.“After the 2008 court verdict, there have been a lot of improvements. Now, a teacher visits the Kumari Ghar daily to tutor the Kumari, who is expected to complete school assignments and sit periodic exams. All the former Kumaris now get benefits like scholarships and special pensions,” she added.Bajracharya is currently a professor of literature at the Tribhuvan University in Kathmandu.“The only significant change that the court verdict brought to the tradition was in terms of her education,” said Gautam Prasad Shakya, the caretaker. “Kumaris were tutored long before the case, but the case helped formalise this arrangement. After the court verdict, the time between 12 pm and 4 pm was designated as the Kumari’s tuition time,” he added.After the verdict, there was a concerted effort to provide Kumaris with access to quality education, enabling them to develop the skills and knowledge needed to lead fulfilling lives beyond their divine roles. There was also a shift towards ensuring that the Kumari's living quarters are comfortable, safe, and conducive to her overall well-being.Moreover, the selection process for the Kumari underwent reforms in the aftermath of the Pun Devi Maharjan case. There was a push for greater transparency, accountability, and inclusivity in the selection of the Kumari, with an emphasis on ensuring that the process was fair, respectful, and free from undue influence.Efforts were made to support their transition into adulthood, including providing them with comprehensive resources for education, vocation, and social integration. This shift aimed to address the challenges faced by former Kumaris and empower them to lead independent and fulfilling lives after their divine service.“The Kumari tradition has evolved over time. During the tenure of my daughter, we saw a lot of improvements. Even after her time as Kumari, Matina continued to get a lot of government support,” said Shakya, former Kumari Matina’s father.“Some people argue that child rights are being violated, but all of her rights are being upheld inside the Kumari Ghar. This is a unique and respected aspect of Nepali culture, and I don’t believe it violates any of my child’s rights.”While the Kumari tradition continues, its practices have evolved. “She enjoys this normal life and it didn’t take her long to adjust as well,” says Matina’s father, on her transition from the revered Kumari to the ordinary Matina. \nWhat animals did Juddha Shumsher have in his zoo?“We only have records of animals from the mid-1960s,” says Ganesh Koirala, who has been employed at the Central Zoo for the past 36 years and currently serves as its information officer and programme officer. “That too I hand-copied from an old torn-down file that I came across.”Today, the Central Zoo, which sprawls across six hectares in Jawalakhel, Lalitpur, houses as many as 1,298 wild animals of different species of mammals, reptiles, fishes and birds from Nepal and around the world—from tiger, rhinoceros, hippopotamus and red panda to its recent attraction: a pair of chimpanzees.After enduring decades of neglect under various government bodies, with its animals and infrastructure scraping along in a deplorable state, the zoo received a new lease of life with improved infrastructure and animal care in 1995, when it came under the management of the King Mahendra Trust for Nature Conservation (KMTNC), now known as the National Trust for Nature Conservation, in 1995.Today, the Central Zoo is an entertainment venue, one of the most happening places in the Kathmandu valley. Flocked by thousands of daily visitors, the zoo now also hosts rescued animals and those in need of rehabilitation. It is also a site for conservation education.But when Juddha Shumsher Rana (prime minister from 1932–1945) built the Jawalakhel Zoological Garden on the premises of his Jawalakhel Durbar (where Nepal Administrative Staff College stands today) in 1932, he did so purely for private interests—as a space of entertainment and amusement for him and his family.Built in the semi-wilderness of Jawalakhel around a historical pond dating to the 17th century during the reign of King Siddhi Narsingh Malla, the zoo also became the space he could use to show his respect for two women he revered, his mother and sister-in-law, and indulge in one of his favourite pastimes—gambling.Today, the Central Zoo, nestled in the heart of Jawalakhel's sprawling crowd, does not go unnoticed, and its story is well told. But what passions drove Juddha to build the zoo? What was its original layout? What animals did it have in the beginning? And how did Juddha spend time there?“I remember once seeing a small board that read ‘Jawalakhel Zoological Garden’,” Koirala says. “I don’t know whether it was from Juddha’s time or was made in the later years. It must surely be that Juddha built the zoo out of influence from the British given how this term was used by them.”Koirala adds, “There is a former employee, now an elderly gentleman who worked in the zoo in the 1960s. He surely has some stories from Juddha’s time.”Birds, beasts and palacesTo trace the birth of Jawalakhel Zoological Garden, one has to look at the history of Nepal’s rulers owning birds and animals.Like rulers around the world, Nepal’s royalty kept wild and exotic birds and animals in captivity as a source of pleasure and mark of wealth and power. The book ‘Social History of Nepal’ by historians TR Vaidya, Tri Ratna Manandhar and Shankar Lal Joshi details how Mallas during the mediaeval Kathmandu Valley to Ranas and Shahs in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries owned rare, exotic creatures. In 1708, a rhinoceros in Kathmandu Valley broke the iron chain in which it was bound and killed its tamer. In 1714, Bhaktapur’s King Bhupatindra Malla gifted a camel and an elephant to Kantipur’s King Bhaskar Malla to build peace.Among Shahs, King Rana Bahadur Shah in particular was reputed for his collection of birds and animals. He also owned a zoo outside his palace in Basantapur Durbar Square, where the Nepal Bank Limited stands in New Road today. The zoo contained “tiger, bear, monkey, elephant, horse, deer… heron, peacock… pigeon, wild dogs, rabbits, rats, mongoose.”Jung Bahadur Rana’s zoo on the premises of his Thapathali Durbar hosted a variety of birds and animals collected during his hunting expeditions as well as those brought from abroad. Jung Bahadur himself used to “supervise and inspect it”. Juddha Shumsher likewise had his own collection of creatures which steadily expanded into a zoological garden. Seeking wilderness in his Jawalakhel DurbarJuddha’s biographer Ishwari Prasad writes in ‘The Life and Times of Maharaja Juddha Shumsher Jung Bahadur Rana’ that between 1933 and 1940, Juddha shot 433 tigers, 33 rhinoceros and 93 leopards. An insatiable big-game hunter, Juddha had a deep fondness for being in the wild and among wild animals, and from this came, according to oral history prevalent among members of Kathmandu’s Rana community including Juddha’s descendants, the desire to own a zoo.Built in 1752, Schönbrunn Zoo in Vienna, the world’s first modern zoo, was already over 100 years old when Juddha was born in 1875. London Zoo opened in 1828 and Alipore Zoological Garden (Kolkata Zoo) in 1875. Nawab Wajid Ali Shah Zoological Garden (Lucknow Zoo) was established in 1921. Juddha’s inspiration, his descendants say, was most likely reinforced by his tours to zoological gardens during his visits to England in 1908 and to different Indian cities.An article titled ‘Central zoo in state of neglect’ published in The Kathmandu Post in 1996 says that Juddha one day “received a pair of leopards as a gift”, cementing his desire to own a zoo. A report ‘Central Zoo Master Plan’ prepared by the KMTNC in 1996 says that Juddha decided to build a zoo in an epiphany when he saw that some animals “including deer, a few rhinos, and some tigers had been collected from the Tarai and kept in Kathmandu” could be put into one compound in the “lonely piece of land with a large 16th [sic] century Malla period Pokhari”.The pond lay still and serene surrounded by green wilderness ever since Patan’s King Siddhi Narsingh Malla built it in the 1600s. On the grounds surrounding this pond, the Newars from Na:Tole, Pulchowk and surroundings had their devisthans where, for centuries, they gathered to perform their religious ceremonies during Basanta Panchami and Bhoto Jatra even after this area fell within the Jawalakhel Durbar.For the palace, the ground served as its extended garden along with a horse and elephant stable. Subodh Rana, 69, grandson of Juddha Shumsher, recalled his father Kiran Shumsher telling him that Juddha and his family sometimes also used the scenic grounds for picnics. If there was any spot where Juddha wanted to build a menagerie, it would be around this Pokhari (pond). One day, he called his grandson General Maheshwar Shumsher Rana and deputed him to the task of doing just this.The zoo’s layout—except for the small plots of lands acquired later—that was in place when it came under KMTNC's management was, the present and retired zoo officials believe, mostly the same as it was built by Maheshwar and so offers a peek into how Juddha’s zoo must have been like. Pond in the middle of the ground surrounded by enclosures—the southern bank housing mainly larger animals, and cages for birds positioned on the northern banks.From pigeons to the king of the jungleWhat animals and birds did the enclosures at Juddha’s zoo house?“We cannot tell for sure,” Koirala says.Once it came under government ownership, the zoo was tossed from one institution to the other for lack of interest and knowledge on the right institution to manage it. Amid all this chaos, documents were possibly lost and the zoo has no concrete record about the animals that Juddha must have once taken amusement at, said Koirala.Mukti Narayan Shrestha, 82, a retired secretary of the Nepal government, joined the Central Zoo in 1970 as a veterinarian when many original structures of the zoo were still intact. Shrestha also worked with an elderly khardar who, he says, was employed in the zoo since the time of Juddha and was about to retire when he joined.“In those days where the purpose of menageries was exclusively for exhibition and pleasure with no regard for the welfare and recreation of animals and birds, the cages were tiny and iron-barred,” Shrestha says.Elephant, horses, deer, monkeys, tiger, rhinoceros, clouded leopard, red panda, bear, palm civet (nir biralo), four-horned antelope, Himalayan goral, pheasants, Himalayan monal—from the mythical and the majestic, the gentle and friendly to the fiery and ferocious, Juddha’s zoo boasted them all, Shrestha says.Shrestha’s account is not different from the anecdotes passed down to other retired and present zoo officials and the members of the Rana community, who also detail the rare and the exotic fauna, like the gharial crocodile and porcupine, even the jungle’s king—creatures, they say, that Juddha must have received from foreigners as gifts—appearing alongside domestic birds like pigeons.Tidbits of published information also confirm that the zoo had a good collection of exotic birds and animals from Nepal and abroad. One such suggestion comes from Kalyan Shumsher’s ‘Shree Teen Juddha Mahima’ published during Juddha’s reign in 1943.“One need not travel abroad to see the incredible birds and animals found in foreign countries,” he writes. “It will suffice to see [those creatures] right here in the zoo opened by His Holiness Shree 3 [Juddha] in Jawalakhel.”Among these incredible creatures, one reigned supreme—lion, the king of the jungle.For one, it would not have satiated Juddha to build a zoo and not have the jungle’s king exhibited in it. Juddha hence must have done everything possible to ensure one for the zoo. Infrastructure at the zoo suggests that the lion indeed lived at Juddha’s zoo or, in the least, during the Rana regime.“Where bear habitat lies today, there were two dome-shaped attached enclosures with a holding room, constructed in the classic architecture that many enclosures in the British zoos had in the past. They had brick walls and lime plaster,” Koirala says. “These were built to house a lion in one cage and a tiger in the other.”Near these enclosures stood another cage that remains intact today, with the head of a roaring lion carved out of the wall on the top of its iron bars. Zoo officials as well as members of the Rana community believe that Juddha had this exhibit built to specifically house a lion.Remarkably, these Juddha-era infrastructural spaces are corroborated by a rare piece of photographic evidence. A 1946 photo of the zoo shows a lion while a Kathmandu mother and her sons stand in front of its cage.Juddha’s place of piety and playThe zoo was not merely a space that Juddha sought out for amusement and retreat in the outpost of his palace; he also used this place to express his deepest affection.This affection spills right at the zoo’s entrance, in the form of the life-size statue of Karma Kumari Devi, wife of Juddha’s elder brother and Rana Prime Minister Dev Shumsher. Karma Kumari stands tall in her regal costume shaded by a wide canopy. Juddha revered Karma Kumari because it was she who raised him and looked after his mother Juhar Kumari Devi after the death of his father Dhir Shumsher. On another prominent part of the zoo on the south-east, Juhar Kumari’s enthroned statue overlooks the pond. Juddha had commissioned the London-based sculptor Domenico Antonio Tonelli to cast these statues.When Karma Kumari’s statue was unveiled is not clear, but Juhar Kumari’s statue was unveiled by Juddha amid a grand function in 1935 on Jawalakhel’s most auspicious day, Bhoto Jatra. It was attended by the British Resident Frederick Bailey.“On June 28, 1935, at Jawalakhel Durbar… the pond nearby looked very scenic,” says a Gorkhapatra news report titled ‘Statue installation’ dated July 5, 1935. “Because it was the day of Bhoto Jatra of Machhindranath… and moreover since an ideal woman’s statue was being unveiled, there was a crowd of lakhs of people.”Less than fifty metres from Karma Kumari’s statue stands a one-story building with a pagoda roof that today serves as the zoo’s meeting hall. Juddha, an avid gambler, found the scenic semi-wilderness covered in trees and filled with the sounds of wildlife to be a perfect place to relish the game. So he built a building with twelve doors on its four sides allowing him and his fellow gambling compatriots the freedom to enter through a particular door that they thought would bring luck. He called it his Juwa Ghar, the gambling house, and built it with the sole purpose of indulging in the game he loved. Roar of lion reverberates in KathmanduThe sounds of the animals and birds in the zoo rose up in the Jawalakhel sky. Every day, until much later in the 1970s, roar of the zoo’s lion (there were later other lions) diffused to far corners of the Valley, merging the zoo with the spirit of Kathmandu and informing the city folks of its presence.But was the zoo open to the public as well?“I think once it was built, the zoo was open for the public,” Subodh Rana said. “It is unlikely that Juddha Shumsher built such a large zoo and kept it only for his family.”For one, Kalyan Shumsher mentioning that one “need not travel abroad to see the incredible birds and animals found in foreign countries” suggests that the public had at least some access to the zoo. Of course, the Newar community from Na:Tole, Pulchowk and surrounding areas were permitted inside the zoo on the days of their guthi functions on Basanta Panchami and Bhoto Jatra.As the zoo was established at the back of the ground where Bhoto Jatra celebrations happen, it naturally filled with revellers on this day in addition to the guthi ritual observers as testified by the Gorkhapatra report. The photo of the mother and her sons also bear testimony that the zoo was not entirely closed to the public.What is widely believed, though, is that the zoo officially came under government ownership after Nepal became a democracy in 1951. And it would still be a few more years before it was open to the public in 1956.In 1945, Juddha gave up his power and eventually retired in Dehradun, India, where he died in 1952. With time, Jawalakhel Zoological Garden became the Central Zoo. It would take many avatars—a neglected site of crammed, unmaintained cages with sad eyes of emaciated creatures staring from behind the bars, a focal point of animal diplomacy, particularly during the period of monarchy, to, in its recent decades, a space of conservation and education.When all this was happening, the city sprawled around Jawalakhel, subduing the lion’s roar with its noise. More wildlife from around the country and the world came—creatures captured from the wild, those sold by circuses, those rescued from traffickers. Fate would bring these creatures to the care of generations of Kathmandu folks, intertwining each other’s joys and sorrows. After the tale of Juddha’s Jawalakhel Zoological Garden, there would be these stories to tell. Sitting around a table inside Juddha’s Juwa Ghar, Koirala and other zoo officials begin unfolding these stories before me. \nOn November 8, 2024, the Maoist Chair and former Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal, while addressing a public gathering of his party members in Kathmandu, attacked his opponents as kujat (lowly caste). He further added that his social intercourse with the parties in power had rendered him and his party maila dhaila (unclean, impure, filthy). Of course, Dahal was rebuking his political rivals and not directly discriminating against Dalits. Yet, a top leader’s use of derogatory casteist slurs was deeply offensive. These terms have long been commonly used to dominate, humiliate, ridicule, exclude and demean Dalits in everyday life. Our campaign group, the Caste Watch Network, has been raising its voice against this offence and demanding a public apology from him. I’ve spoken on some YouTube channels and written an article in Setopati online. We may as well hit the street for our dignity. However, there’s been no outrage in the Dalit community. When I mentioned this to some noted Dalit parliamentarians, activists and intellectuals, they just shrugged it off; they didn’t even dare to protest on their social media platforms! Why apologise? Dahal must publicly recognise his mistake—intentional or otherwise—and seek an apology from the Dalit community. He can’t just make excuses. Here are some of the reasons for this.First, his deployment of the casteist terms has deeply hurt Dalits. Their inability to speak out notwithstanding, most Dalits do feel humiliated, not least at the hands of the leader of a major party. If he were not powerful, Dalits would almost certainly have protested vociferously on social media and the streets.In March 2019, a popular folk singer and the then Member of Parliament Komal Oli infuriated Dalits by using a casteist proverb—“let a dum become the king after my death” (dum being a highly derogatory term)—in one of her TV interviews. Dalits raised their voices, mainly on social media, and she was forced to formally apologise in Parliament.Second, Dahal’s derogatory expression is illegal. He can be challenged in a court of law for crimes related to caste discrimination and hate speech. His power and influence will likely prevent a criminal investigation, but as the lawyers tell me, the case can still be taken to court. More importantly, Dahal should apologise to Dalits for the sake of his political future. Dalit community is one of his pedestals, and he cannot afford to be alienated at a time of his rapidly declining popularity.Many Dalits are still grateful to the Maoist party for its contribution to terminating the Hindu monarchy and establishing a system of proportional representation, including, for example, a Dalit woman in each ward office. They are grateful to him for giving them some power and confidence to fight against caste hierarchy.They particularly remember his attempts to directly act against caste discrimination in many villages during the “People’s War’’. Dalits believe the armed struggle undoubtedly made the practice of caste discrimination less severe—even though the problem has rebounded since the end of the armed conflict. However, Dalits have become somewhat confused and frustrated with Dahal and his party in recent years. During his three tenures as prime minister, he didn’t make any tangible effort to enforce anti-caste laws nor offer any powerful ministerial position to Dalits. Nor did he appoint any Dalit to an influential position in a state body.So, it’s time for Dahal and his party to retain and revive the great support of the marginalised groups, including Dalits. Apologising to Dalits (perhaps unwittingly) for uttering anti-Dalit statements would help increase his popularity within the community. Dalit servitude exposed The lack of Dalit response to Dahal’s casteist slurs has exposed the degree of their servitude to the upper castes, especially powerful leaders. It shows Dalits’ mental slavery. Why do Dalits lack self-strength and self-confidence? This is an essential reflexive question for Dalit activists themselves. There are many reasons for Dalits' inability to defend their dignity. One major drawback is the absence of an independent Dalit struggle. There is no Dalit ideology and philosophy other than those spoon-fed by upper-caste leaders. Unlike in India, Nepali Dalit activists and their organisations are connected to one party or another, and a handful of parties control all resources and opportunities. Given the circumstances, a Dalit activist, politician, or intellectual not affiliated with a political party is rare. Dalits would thus be fearful of the high-caste men and women in power. Even those Dalits who are not politically active live in fear of the party leaders. For one thing, it seems impossible to get anything done without the support of the parties. Finding employment, opening and running a business or NGO and the rest would be difficult without the backing of a powerful party. Lives and properties aren’t considered safe in our country unless parties provide protection. Further, the parties heavily influence the courts and law enforcement so much that whenever a person is arrested for any alleged crime, the first thing the investigating officers ask is the party the suspect belongs to! And parties often protect their cadres even when they’ve committed heinous crimes like rape and murder.Of course, these are the common issues people of all castes in Nepal face. But the marginalised sections of society are naturally more vulnerable and need to take extra measures not to offend or upset anybody in power, let alone those at the top of the food chain.I believe the biggest problem with Dalits’ inability to fight back is their mental slavery—which I call jadaubad. Jadau is a traditional salutation by the lower castes to the upper castes, showing their deference and obedience to the masters. Dalits were required to bow before the high castes and utter jadau malik (greetings, master)! In today’s democratic republic, Dalits aren’t obligated to show this degree of deference to the upper castes. Nor are Dalits as powerless, intimidated and impoverished as during the Rana and Panchayat regimes. Their economic and social positions are gradually rising. Yet, Dalits haven’t given up their habit of showing excessive respect to the higher castes, especially towards influential leaders.Breaking this long and feudal habit of displaying excessive deference to the leaders—jadaubad—is a prerequisite for freeing Dalit minds and bringing forth new ideologies and strategies and thus raising a Dalit liberation struggle free from the control of the high-caste party leaders. We should start with at least some of us being brave enough to fight against leaders like Dahal when they hurt our dignity and self-worth.  \nThe petroleum-laden dust has settled on this year’s United Nations climate summit, COP29, held over the past fortnight in Baku, Azerbaijan. Climate scientists, leaders, lobbyists and delegates are heading for home. The meeting achieved incremental progress. Negotiators agreed on a new climate finance target of at least $300 billion a year by 2035 (A$460 billion), up from $100 billion now. These funds would help developing nations shift away from fossil fuels, adapt to the warming climate and respond to loss and damage from climate disasters.Nations also agreed on the essential rules for a global carbon trading market, the last agreement needed to make the 2015 Paris Agreement fully operational. As UN climate chief Simon Stiell said in the final session, the 29th Conference of the Parties (COP29) meeting showed the Paris Agreement was delivering on climate action, but national governments “still need to pick up the pace”.I attended COP29 as an expert in international climate law and litigation. I observed the finance negotiations firsthand and represented a new alliance of Australian and Pacific universities supporting international climate cooperation. At the outset, expectations for the conference were low. The United States had just voted for the return of climate denier Donald Trump. And Azerbaijan President Ilham Aliyev declared oil and gas a “gift of God” at an opening event. But even with these considerable headwinds, progress was made.Progress on climate financeThe world’s rich countries currently contribute $100 billion a year to climate finance for developing nations. It pays for measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and adapt to climate change by making systems more resilient. Two years ago, countries agreed to create a new “loss and damage” fund for nations dealing with climate disasters, launched at the summit in Dubai last year. At these COP29 talks, Australia announced it would contribute A$50 million ($32 million) to this fund. Climate change is already costing developing countries huge sums, estimated at $100-$500 billion a year.These flows of funding from rich countries are essential for developing nations to increase their emissions reduction, as well as respond to climate damage. The COP29 deal sets a target of at least $300 billion per year by 2035, with richer countries leading delivery. While this goal represents a tripling of the previous target, it falls far short of the $400-$900 billion many developing countries had called for in finance from rich governments. Disappointed developing country representatives labelled it “a paltry sum” and a “joke”. It also falls short of what experts say is needed by 2035 to meet global climate finance needs. Recognising this gap, the text calls on “all actors to work together” to scale up finance from all public and private sources to at least $1.3 trillion per year by 2035. Ways this might be achieved will be presented at COP30 in Belém, Brazil, a year from now.Making the international carbon market a realityCOP29 also reached an agreement that settles longstanding disputes about making the international carbon market a reality. This hard-won deal delivered global standards for carbon trading, opening up new ways for developing countries to boost their renewable energy capacity. These rules will pave the way for country-to-country trading of carbon credits. Each credit represents a tonne of carbon dioxide either removed from the atmosphere or not emitted. The deal will give countries more flexibility in how they meet their emissions targets.It’s not perfect. Concerns linger on whether the rules will ensure trades reflect real projects and how transparent and accountable the market will be. But the agreement will boost the importance of carbon credits and could increase incentives to protect carbon “sinks”—such as rainforests, seagrass meadows and mangroves—with flow-on nature benefits.New national climate goalsBy February 2025, all 195 Paris signatories have to announce more ambitious emission targets. Some countries announced their new plans at COP29. The most ambitious was the United Kingdom, which upped its 2030 goal of a 68 percent cut to reducing 81percent below 1990 emissions by 2035. Next year’s host, Brazil, released new targets for a 59–67 percent drop below 2005 levels by 2035. But Brazil didn’t amend its 2030 ambitions and plans to boost oil and gas production 36 percent by 2035.The United Arab Emirates announced target cuts of 47 percent before 2035, ahead of net zero by 2050. But this pledge was criticised by climate campaigners because the UAE is projected to boost oil and gas production 34 percent by by 2035. The host, Azerbaijan, did not release its goals. Many other countries, including Australia, also held off from announcing new targets in Baku.Indecision on fossil fuelsFossil fuels were the elephant in the room. At last year’s COP in Dubai, nations finally agreed to include wording on, “transitioning away from fossil fuels in energy systems, in a just, orderly and equitable manner, accelerating action in this critical decade, so as to achieve net zero by 2050 in keeping with the science.” But at this year’s COP, there was no decision on how, exactly, to begin this transition—and fossil fuels are not explicitly mentioned in the outcome documents. Delegates from oil giant Saudi Arabia repeatedly tried to block mention of fossil fuels across all of the negotiating streams.Trump’s return wasn’t a deal-breakerThe consequences of Trump’s re-election for climate action were much discussed. But I observed a surprising amount of acceptance and even optimism for climate cooperation. The US is the world’s second-largest emitter, after China. Trump has promised to ramp up the country’s oil and gas production, and pull the US from the Paris Agreement as he did during his first term. But climate action continued regardless—especially in renewables giant China, which hit its 2030 renewable target this year. The US is no longer the main player in climate negotiations, and many countries are much further down the road of cutting emissions. Few show signs of backtracking.As the US bows out, it creates a vacuum. At COP29, middle powers such as Canada, the UK and Australia stepped up. Negotiators from a progressive High Ambition Coalition—including small island states, the European Union and Latin American countries such as Colombia—played an important role in pushing to urgently increase finance for climate action. China, for its part, is clearly eyeing off the position of climate leader about to be vacated by the US. And leaders of progressive US states attended COP29 to show parts of the US are still on board with climate action.Australia’s hosting bid for 2026 talks in limboAustralia’s bid to host COP31 in 2026 alongside Pacific nations was tipped to win, given it had the support from nearly all of the 29 “Western European and Other States” group of nations which will decide the host this time. Many observers expected an announcement at the end of COP29. But no decision was made, as the rival bidder, Türkiye, did not withdraw its bid. An announcement is now likely in mid-2025—after Australia’s next federal election.What now?Many people are disappointed by COP29. It did not bring transformative change. The huge jump in climate finance called for by developing countries, and many in civil society, didn’t eventuate. It came as 2024 is on track to be the hottest on record, and the costs of extreme weather have risen to more than $2 trillion over the last decade. But this year’s talks were still a step forward, affirming international climate cooperation at a time of significant geopolitical tensions globally. As the UN’s Simon Stiell said, “the UN Paris Agreement is humanity’s life-raft; there is nothing else […] We are taking that journey forward together.”—The ConversationRead the original article here. \nSanatana Dharma, often described as the “eternal religion,” serves as a foundational element of Hindu spirituality, encompassing a timeless set of duties and practices transcending societal divisions such as class, caste and sect. With its principles deeply rooted in harmony with nature, sustainability and collective well-being, Sanatana Dharma aligns with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Exploring its rituals and philosophies reveals valuable insights for contemporary sustainable living, offering guidance for addressing modern global challenges.Sanatana Dharma and SDGsSanatana Dharma’s alignment with the SDGs is evident in various practices and traditions. Recently observed festivals like Chhath, Diwali (known as Tihar in Nepal), Makar Sankranti and Navratri embody sustainability through rituals such as cleaning riverbanks, using biodegradable oil lamps and revering nature. These practices reflect the ethos of SDG 12, which promotes responsible consumption and production while fostering environmental awareness and community collaboration. Similarly, the concept of dāna (charity) addresses SDG 1 (No poverty) and SDG 2 (Zero hunger) by encouraging wealth redistribution through food donations and other forms of giving, helping bridge social inequities. The concept of dāna (charity), particularly anna dāna (food donation), holds significant importance, with numerous festivals mandating acts of giving such as moksha dhenu dāna (cow donation for liberation), vastra dāna (clothing donation) and sejiya dāna (bedding donation). These practices encourage those with resources to support the underprivileged, thereby addressing issues of hunger and poverty.The focus on Ayurveda, yoga and meditation in Sanatana Dharma aligns with SDG 3 (Good Health and Well-being) by emphasising preventive health care. Additionally, the traditional Gurukul education system, which integrated ethics and self-awareness, mirrors SDG 4 (Quality Education). Gender equality is celebrated through the veneration of female deities such as Durga, Saraswati and Lakshmi, aligning with SDG 5. Ancient texts, such as RigVed, underscore women's intellectual and spiritual achievements during the Vedic period. While historical and cultural interpretations may differ, the fundamental teachings of Sanatana Dharma advocate for respect and equality between genders. Hindu scriptures and rituals frequently recognise and honour the diversity of gender identities, including the tritiya prakriti (third gender), which encompasses transgender individuals.SDG Goal 6 emphasises Clean Water and Sanitation, while SDG 14 focuses on life below water. Sanatana Dharma’s reverence for rivers such as the Bagmati, Bishnumati, Ganga, Yamuna, Cauvery, Narmada, Sindhu, Godavari, Brahmaputra and Tapti, along with water-centric rituals, highlight principles of water conservation and cleanliness. Many of these rituals explicitly discourage water pollution. Similarly, SDG 7, which advocates for Affordable and Clean Energy, aligns with the reliance on natural resources in Sanatana Dharma's rituals, supporting renewable and sustainable energy use. SDG 8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth) and SDG 10 (Reduced Inequalities) find parallels in the principles of karma yoga (duty-driven work) and the ethical pursuit of artha (prosperity) in Sanatana Dharma, promoting fair and purposeful economic practices. Traditionally, households in Nepal and India adhered to minimalistic and resourceful lifestyles, buying necessities, avoiding unnecessary borrowing and finding ways to reuse items—for example, passing down clothes from older to younger siblings.Additionally, acts of charity to support the poor and needy were widely practised. SDG 13, which focuses on climate action, resonates with Sanatana Dharma through practices like tree worship, seasonal festivals and honouring natural cycles, all representing a commitment to environmental conservation. Likewise, SDG 15, centred on Life on Land, aligns with the Dharma’s respect for all living beings and the environment. This is evident in rituals and teachings emphasising forests, animals and biodiversity protection.Modern practices and environmental degradationDespite the sustainability principles deeply embedded in Sanatana Dharma, cities in India and Nepal often face severe environmental challenges. Many urban areas appear polluted and unclean, with major rivers suffering from contamination. In India, post-Diwali celebrations frequently lead to smog and a rise in air quality index (AQI) levels. Numerous Sanatana Dharma festivals are now associated with different types of pollution: Holi contributes to water pollution, Chhath impacts river cleanliness, Kanwar Yatra and Durga Puja generate noise pollution and Diwali is linked to air pollution. These issues highlight a stark contrast between the sustainable ethos of Sanatana Dharma and the current environmental reality, with alarming pollution levels, inadequate urban waste management and overexploitation of natural resources.Identifying the disconnectThere is a noticeable disconnect between tradition and modernity. The commercialisation of rituals has led to practices that deviate significantly from their original sustainable intent. For example, using non-biodegradable materials during festivals undermines their environmentally conscious foundations. Moreover, rapid urbanisation and population growth have put immense pressure on natural resources, making it increasingly difficult to uphold traditional sustainable practices. Lastly, a lack of awareness about the ecological wisdom inherent in these customs has led to their neglect or misinterpretation.Sanatana Dharma offers a strong grounding and philosophical framework to holistically address the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Its emphasis on interconnectedness, non-violence (ahimsa) and reverence for nature aligns naturally with global sustainability objectives. However, realising its full potential requires deliberate efforts to adapt and modernise rituals while preserving their essence. As the birthplace of Sanatana Dharma, Nepal and India are uniquely positioned to lead by example. By bridging the gap between its traditional teachings and contemporary needs, they can inspire their populations—and the world—to embrace a lifestyle that harmonises with the planet. Aligning modern practices with the enduring values of Sanatana Dharma can pave the way for progress toward achieving the SDGs while safeguarding a rich and timeless legacy.The path aheadRevisiting traditional wisdom is essential for the future. By reinterpreting rituals through sustainability, their relevance can be revitalised. For example, promoting eco-friendly festival practices like using clay oil lamps (diyo) and natural rangoli colours, avoiding fireworks and opting for locally sourced organic food reflects a commitment to sustainability. Additionally, education and awareness initiatives are essential. Integrating the principles of Sanatana Dharma into the educational curriculum that is not just confined to the environment but also business and other cross-cutting disciplines at the undergraduate and graduate level in universities can foster respect for nature and cultivate a sense of responsibility in younger generations. Such a curriculum can be integrated at the school level as well. Community-driven efforts are also vital. Encouraging projects like river clean-up campaigns, inspired by river worship traditions, can have a lasting impact on the environment. Policy support is another critical aspect. Governments should integrate these practices into policies to encourage adoption by offering incentives for eco-friendly approaches. \nPrime Minister and CPN-UML chair KP Sharma Oli likes to project an image of a decisive leader. This much-valued leadership trait often works to his advantage. Yet when he makes decisions on the fly, it can backfire just as often. This past Friday, the UML held a mass gathering in the national capital in order to “raise awareness against anarchy”. Many found it curious that the party leading the national government would call for such a gathering: Shouldn’t the prime minister be focusing on delivery and leave all the protests and rallies to opposition forces? The real reason behind the rally, as party insiders put it, was the UML’s desire to “project strength” at a time of widespread public disenchantment. The rally and the eventual gathering at Durbar Marg, it was hoped, would send an unmistakable signal to other political forces that the party is still a potent force capable of mobilising big masses at short notice. Such a show of strength had apparently become vital after much smaller forces like the Rastriya Swatantra Party and even some troublemakers associated with Durga Prasai were seen hitting the streets in order to “sow anarchy”. The Friday event turned out to be dud. The party had expected at least 100,000 to turn up; the actual crowd was much smaller. In any case, Oli and other top UML leaders who addressed the Durbar Marg gathering had little of substance to say. For instance, the prime minister spent considerable time denouncing the RSP chair Rabi Lamichhane and his supposedly dubious character. This was rum as Lamichhane is currently in police custody and facing a series of criminal charges. Moreover, the RSP protests against Lamichhane’s arrest have already fizzled out. So, instead of promising no government intervention on investigations against Lamichhane and others arrested on charges of cooperatives fraud, why continue to hound a jailed and much-diminished political opponent? Whatever Oli’s intent, it betrayed a deep sense of insecurity vis-a-vis Lamichhane and even the smallest forces that have criticised his government leadership. This wasn’t a display of strength, either from Oli or the UML. It was rather an inadvertent show of weakness which the party’s political opponents will greatly relish. Any way you look at it, the gathering, organised on a weekday and at great inconvenience for commuters, was unnecessary, nay, a nuisance. Again, it is hard to read Oli, and perhaps whatever purpose he had in mind has been served. But most folks are left scratching their heads. The head of government, instead of governing and trying to silence his critics through delivery, is seen spewing venom against his political opponents at a rally that seemingly no one except him wanted. There is also a sense of unease among the people. Our prime minister and his party seem incapable of taking criticism and if someone raises a question, they will try to shout down the questioner. Ironically, the protest against anarchy itself turned out to be rather anarchic: Lacking a purpose, horribly organised and disturbing people’s daily lives.  \nThe line between fake content and free speech online is razor-thin. A recent case in point is controversial businessman Durga Prasai’s accusation against Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli. Prasai, taking to social media, alleged that the Nepali premier had invested Rs32.5 billion in a telecom company in Cambodia. The police determined that the documents he presented were clear fakes, as Oli’s signature was forged and even his name presented in some documents as ‘evidence’ was incorrect. As a result, following an order from the Kathmandu District Court, Prasai was arrested on Tuesday.The constitution of Nepal upholds free speech and the freedom to broadcast audiovisual content, but these rights should be exercised without harming anyone. People like Prasai have repeatedly weaponised social media platforms to settle personal scores or to promote political agenda. Even though social media and the internet at large have been pivotal in promoting free speech, their roles in driving fake news and mis/disinformation have gone out of hand. In recent times, deepfakes like audio recordings and video clips can easily mimic someone else’s identity using artificial intelligence, with the intent of sullying people’s reputation and spreading false information. Only in September, the editor and the publisher of an online portal, sidhakura.com, were arrested for circulating a series of malicious audio-video content targeting some prominent members of the society. Countries around the world are concerned about the rise of mis/disinformation online and are working to make such tools ethical with the help of wide civic engagement, discussions and technical consultations. Nepal, on the other hand, has taken an opposite approach. It has introduced a controversial Social Media Bill that violates international human rights norms and tramples on Nepal’s constitutional rights. This ham-fisted attempt to regulate social media platforms, many argue, will undermine free speech if implemented in its current form. The bill is rightly criticised for being brought without broad consultations. Moreover, Section 3 of the bill provides for a Social Media Management Council led by the Minister for Communication and Information Technology—a political position. According to Media Action Nepal’s analysis of the bill, such a council lacks members of civil society organisations and other bodies working to promote free speech and to fight misinformation. When regulatory provisions are not transparent, they cannot work for common good. Without broad consultations and deliberations, such legislation risks becoming a tool for political control rather than a means to protect democracy. Individuals like Prasai indeed demonstrate the dangers of unregulated digital platforms, but knee-jerk bills like the current Social Media Bill also risk undermining free speech.Nepal must address the challenges brought about by technological advancement with care. Blindly blocking social media sites, as was done with TikTok, is not the way to go about it. Our approach to tackling misinformation and fake content must balance the protection of free speech with the need for wise and workable social media regulation, even if it takes some time. Engaging civil society, media organisations and tech experts is essential to create ethical and effective solutions. Part of the focus should also be on digital literacy, sensitising the public on the consequences of malintent content, and promoting fact-checking mechanisms. The Durga Prasai case highlights the need for wise social media regulation; but this process must begin with broadest possible consultations.  \nThe inauguration of an immigration office at Korala border point in Upper Mustang’s Lo Manthang on October 30 had given a message of improved connectivity with the northern neighbour. But the excitement didn’t last as the office, opened with fanfare, was closed without delivering service for a single day. While unveiling the commemorative plaque, Home Minister Ramesh Lekhak was flanked by a group of high profile officials. Gandaki Province Chief Minister Surendra Raj Pandey, heads of three security agencies, director general of the immigration department, among others, landed at Lo Manthang to attend the function. No sooner had the VIPs returned to Kathmandu, other officials deployed there also decamped as Tihar festival began the next day. But they didn’t go back even after the end of the festivities citing the biting cold of the high mountain. Nepal has kept the border facility closed since the inauguration citing severe cold. This is a lame excuse. The weather didn’t suddenly turn cold there, nor has the situation on the ground worsened due to a natural disaster or other unforeseen events. Everyone knew that Korala border point, which is situated at an altitude of 4,650 metres, would witness a freezing cold in the winter. The authorities should have prepared before the inauguration. By contrast, the offices on the Chinese side are operating just fine.Bringing the immigration and other offices into operation at Lo Manthang is important as the Korala border point not only connects Nepal and China but also has a potential to be a trilateral trade junction between Nepal, India and China. Nepal has been building the Kaligandaki Corridor national pride project that connects the Siddhartha Highway in the south to Korala in the north. When the road is complete, the route from Nepal-India border point at Sunauli to Nepal-China border point at Korala through Siddhartha Highway and Kaligandaki corridor can be an alternative trilateral trade route linking the three countries. While important religious destinations such as Lumbini and Muktinath are on the route, it also connects Nepal’s important cities including Pokhara and Chitwan.Failure to bring this border point into operation has multiple effects. First, it undermines the route’s huge potential. Second, it leaves a bad impression on the Chinese. Indian, Chinese, and other countries that have been supporting us have a serious concern about Nepal’s negligence in development works. We sign agreements or inaugurate projects with a lot of noise, but don’t work on their maintenance or sustainability.Closure of Korala immigration is a case in point. Several projects started with Indian support have met with similar fate. India’s railway company constructed the Kurta-Bijalpura rail section and handed over the rail line to the Nepal Railway Company Limited last year. It has since been helping operate the train as Nepal is still to train its own staff to run the train.As Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli works on a wish list to be presented before Chinese leaders during his Beijing visit in the first week of December, such failure in bilateral initiatives weaken Nepal’s position. When Nepal seeks other countries’ support in its development endeavours, it must at least be ready to shoulder its share of responsibility. India and China have shown ability in infrastructure development, both at home and abroad. By failing to do even the bare minimum to take them into confidence, Nepal is severely undercutting its development prospects.  \nFormer Indian chief election commissioner SY Quraishi is a strong advocate of credible elections and inclusive democracy. He has extensively spoken and written on how increasing flow of money in elections is taking away the level playing field for candidates from different backgrounds. During his recent visit to Kathmandu, Binod Ghimire of the Post and Suresh Raj Neupane and Rajesh Mishra of Kantipur talked to him on a range of issues from electoral reforms, challenges in maintaining election sanctity in the age of generative artificial intelligence, to why the world is swinging right. Excerpts:Elections and democracy are intertwined. However, recent election results the world over are being seen as a threat to law and democracy. How do you see this phenomenon?Democracy and elections are two sides of the same coin. Without elections, there is no democracy. And worldwide, for the past 10 years, there is a swing towards the right, even in the US. In India, of course, we have been on the right for the past 10 years and our prime minister got a third term, though with a bit of reduced majority.The other thing is that in the past 10-12 years, there has been a debate on whether democracy is on a decline worldwide. The fact is that several indices of democracy indicate the decline. But people’s will cannot be taken as a threat to democracy. Sometimes they go to the left, sometimes, they move to the right. We cannot call it a threat to democracy. The democracy indices which I mentioned have a different classification.First, there are full democracies. Then there are flawed democracies. Third is hybrid democracies. The fourth is an authoritarian regime. So even in South Asia, we have one or two countries which are authoritarian, like Afghanistan and Pakistan. Their ranking keeps going up or down depending on the electoral and democratic performance. In India, the right-wing is ruling, but they lost some majority. They are now depending on two other parties, which are not considered right-wing. Of course, Trump got an absolute majority this time winning both popular vote and electoral votes. He also won both the houses. So, this is what can make him dictatorial. As it is, he is mercurial, and everybody is speculating how he is going to behave. Let’s wait and see.We can agree that people cannot be taken as a threat to democracy. But can we say that the elections, rather than complementing the spirit of democracy, are turning into tools to endorse majoritarianism?Well, people’s will is supreme. If they have chosen absolute governments, if they have given large majorities, you cannot blame the people. Many times a lot of money is being used in elections, and only the rich people get to win elections. In India, for instance, 93 percent of MPs who got elected are crorepatis [multi-millionaires]. Now, law provides for a ceiling on expenditure, so that level playing field is established, where you and I can also contest.But then, the ceiling on expenditure in India has one flaw—it is only for candidates, not political parties. This negates or neutralises the purpose of the ceiling. You can’t spend more than 1 crore, but your party can spend 20 crores on you. So where is the level playing field? Some people say there should be state funding of elections. I oppose the idea but recommend state funding of political parties. It is difficult to monitor election expenditure because of black money. Funding political parties with cheques is what I recommend because it is easy to monitor. So you think election management is more of a problem than the electoral system?Actually, both are important, because obviously the management follows what the system prescribes. There are laws, there are rules, and they have to be followed. For instance, on political funding, there is a cap on expenditure provided by law, and the election management body implements it. Therefore, we have to improve both. Both are equally important. We say public consciousness has increased with time, but there are also concerns that people are picking right-wing leaders. So what is wrong?Actually, it’s a good question but difficult to answer. Why is it that the whole world is turning right? But there are also states like Austria where everybody was thinking the extreme right was winning, but then liberals won. So, there are exceptions. Maybe people want a strong and stable government, which has the benefit of continuity. On the other hand, such a government can be accused of majoritarianism.I heard your prime minister, Oli-ji, mentioning frequent government changes. Obviously, how can the government function with this kind of instability? On the other hand there is the prime minister of India who has been elected for the third term. It is the people's choice, and you can't fault the people. The people chose stability and a strong government, and we have to respect that.Are people not knowledgeable enough to pick the right representatives for themselves?This question is often raised. For instance, we were talking about crorepatis and criminals in politics. Almost 46 percent of MPs in India have criminal cases against them. When we talk to these MPs, they say, look, people are choosing us, so how can you blame us? That way the blame is passed on to the people.Why is the electorate choosing dishonest people against whom there are criminal cases? This debate leads us nowhere. So obviously there is something good these people with criminal background must be doing in the constituency. Maybe they commit crime outside the constituency and like Robin Hood, benefit their own people.Aam Aadmi Party was a new party, and won 67 out of 70 seats in Delhi. They managed funds through crowdfunding and volunteers. And they won hands down.What are the issues that have come up with the proliferation of social media and new media?Social media and new media have revolutionised communication. But, initially, when the election commission of India in 2012 or 2013 came out with some regulation, there was a lot of public criticism, which was unjustified. Social media is also media. So whatever applies to media will apply to social media. And in the election context, what applies to the media? Two things: How much money are you spending on buying space in the newspaper and how much money are you paying to the TV channel?Therefore, how much money are you paying to Facebook or WhatsApp, you have to account for it as well. The law on expenditure will apply to social media also. The second concern was how will the election commission catch the violators, as they are anonymous. The difficulty in catching them cannot be an excuse for not taking cognisance of their offence. If we cannot catch them today, tomorrow we will. How can something be illegal in a newspaper and legal on social media?Rumours always play a big role in elections. Social media has multiplied the problem a thousand times. Within two, three minutes, your country can be burned by false, fake news. Social media however has many benefits. For instance, instead of buying space in the newspaper and TV channel, through WhatsApp or Twitter you can reach your audience in two seconds flat.So social media is a double-edged weapon, as was the consensus in the Kantipur Conclave. And, you know, it is like a knife. Is a knife good or bad? If you want to cut an apple, it is good. If you want to cut a man’s throat, it is bad. It depends how you use it. Now, artificial intelligence has given rise to even deep fakes. But AI has benefits too. Through artificial intelligence, impersonation can be stopped. Voting and logistics can be monitored. But there is so much fraud, deep fakes, and hate. So how do you catch them? That is something we have to be wary about. Frankly, I am worried because its dangers outweigh the benefits. We have to put our heads together globally to make sure artificial intelligence doesn’t overtake human intelligence for destructive ends.In Nepal, both federal and provincial elections happen at once. India too is now mulling ‘one nation, one election’. What is your take on this?There are benefits and there are problems. Logistically, it makes sense. But one MP of Odisha posed this question: ask the people. What do they want? Poor people love frequent elections because this is the only way they can highlight their importance. Otherwise, how many times have we seen that posters are put up in a constituency with headings like ‘Missing’, or ‘Wanted’ [representatives]? Frequent elections make the representatives accountable.We heard you say that if India does ‘one nation, one election’, that will be the presidential election. What do you mean?During parliamentary elections, there are national and international issues. The issues are different in Parliament [national], Vidhan Sabha [state-level] and Panchayat [local]. I would like to say that the local body elections are as important, perhaps more important because they’re closer to the people.India’s prime minister initially said that there would be a national debate and a consensus would be reached. There was a debate for 10 years, but there was no consensus.If there was no consensus, the idea should have been dropped. But the government decided unilaterally that we will go ahead and set up a committee led by the former president of India to suggest ways to implement ‘one nation, one election’. In my articles I have questioned the propriety of a former president being drawn into a government committee.They have made some questionable recommendations. They say that simultaneous will mean Vidhan Sabha and Lok Sabha, not Panchayat. But the terms of reference clearly say that simultaneous means all three tiers. Then it says Panchayat elections can be held after 100 days. After 100 days, there is a separate election. It’s a new election and will require totally different arrangements. These are also not simultaneous elections.  \nNew Zealand all-rounder James Neesham is one of the biggest stars set to feature in the inaugural Nepal Premier League (NPL) T20 cricket tournament, scheduled from November 30 to December 21 at the TU Cricket Ground in Kirtipur, on the outskirts of the Kathmandu Valley. Neesham, 34, who has represented the Kiwis in 12 Tests, 76 ODIs, and 79 T20Is, scoring over 3,000 runs across all formats, will play for the Janakpur Bolts in this debut season of the NPL. Although Neesham hasn’t played Test cricket since 2016 and last featured in an ODI during the 2023 Cricket World Cup, he continues to be a prominent figure in franchise cricket globally. His impressive resume includes stints in the Indian Premier League with teams like Delhi Daredevils, Kings XI Punjab, Kolkata Knight Riders, Mumbai Indians and Rajasthan Royals, as well as appearances in the Vitality Blast, Bangladesh Premier League, SA20 of South Africa, The Hundred, Pakistan Super League, Big Bash League, Caribbean Premier League, and Champions League T20. Currently, he is playing for Ajman Bolts in the Abu Dhabi T10 League. Binod Pandey of Kantipur Daily, a sister publication of The Kathmandu Post, talked to Neesham through email about his upcoming participation in the NPL. Excerpt:What do you hope to gain from NPL, and how do you view Nepal’s cricketing landscape?I am really looking forward to playing cricket in a new country. I’ve heard awesome things about the passion the locals have for cricket and the beautiful surroundings of Nepal. So, I am expecting great crowds and a beautiful country to boot.As a renowned big-hitting all-rounder, how do you plan to leverage your skills to make a significant impact this season?My approach will be very much the same as the other leagues I play in. I like to think I can contribute in all facets of the game and that will be my primary objective.Having played with and against some of the world’s best cricketers, how do you think that experience will contribute to the success of Janakpur Bolts?I’m sure I will be drawing on some of our local players’ knowledge of conditions and opposition, but I do hope my experience will enable me to help the team in the ever changing match scenarios you find yourselves in when it comes to T20 cricket. What motivated you to choose Janakpur Bolts?I have recently started playing with the Bolts franchise in a few other competitions and I was keen to maintain that connection with the group, particularly in light of the positive experiences I have had with them so far. You’re famous for your sense of humor on social media. How do you plan to connect with fans during your time with Janakpur Bolts?I always love spending time with the fans whenever I play. They are the bedrock of our sport and without them the game would be a very boring place. Like I said earlier, I’ve heard such great things about Nepal’s passion for the game. I hope my performances can help ignite that further.Besides cricket, what are you most excited to experience and explore in Nepal?Whenever I visit a new place I always look forward to experiencing local cultures. Nepal’s beauty is well documented so being able to experience that first hand is an exciting prospect.Do you have any plans to explore Nepal beyond cricket? Perhaps an Everest trek someday, following in the footsteps of your compatriot Adam Parore?If the opportunity arises in the future, I would certainly consider it. Although I think my main focus this trip will be on cricket!Lastly, what message would you like to share with the fans of Janakpur Bolts?⁠Get yourselves down to the ground and support the boys—we will do our very best to put on a show for you all! \nIndian political scientist Pratap Bhanu Mehta explores the rise of populist leaders, challenges of international relations, and key factors influencing Nepal-India relations.\nPrime Minister Oli prepares to visit China in December, highlighting cooperation priorities, infrastructure development, and seeking favorable loan terms for Pokhara airport while addressing concerns about connectivity, project implementation, and relations with India.\nFormer Election Commissioner Bhojraj Pokharel highlights Nepal's increasing electoral corruption, fueled by loopholes in donation laws and collusion between politicians and large businesses, leading to weakened state agencies and a lack of progress despite rampant corruption.\nHilly areas of Koshi, Bagmati, and Gandaki Provinces face light rain and snowfall, while the rest of Nepal experiences clear skies with a temperature range of 0.5°C to 28°C.\nPartly cloudy skies and possible light rain in hilly regions of eastern and central Nepal, with fair weather elsewhere, influenced by westerly winds; Janakpur records highest temperature, Jumla lowest.\nKoshi and Gandaki hills may face light rain and snow, while rest of Nepal remains partly cloudy to fair with January temperatures ranging from 30°C to -3.1°C.\nOn Saturday the weather is forecast to be partly to generally cloudy in the hilly regions of Koshi, Bagmati, Gandaki and Karnali Province and mainly fair in the rest of the country.Light rain is likely to occur at one or two places of hilly regions of Koshi, Bagmati, Gandaki and Karnali Province.

Write it in the form of inspiring story not news article or event.\n    \n    Story:\nOnce upon a time, nestled between the towering peaks of the Himalayas and the lush jungles of the Terai, there was a country named Nepal. Though still a developing nation, Nepal was a land of profound beauty and deep-rooted cultural heritage. The residents of Nepal faced many challenges, but beneath these hardships lay a resilient spirit and an unyielding hope for the future.\n\nThis enchanting land, where Mount Everest reaches towards the skies and the air carries a mix of incense and cool mountain breezes, was more than a geographical marvel. It was a mosaic of cultures, languages, and traditions, a testament to human endeavor against all odds. Nepal's history, from the unification under King Prithvi Narayan Shah to its transformation into a federal democratic republic, told a story of aspiration and endurance.\n\nIn recent years, the people of Nepal, with their indomitable will, had taken strides towards rebuilding and reimagining their country. They turned their struggles into stepping stones, each challenge a chapter in their ongoing saga. The shift from a monarchy to a republic had not only changed governance but had woven a new tapestry of democratic values and collective decision-making.\n\nEconomically, while agriculture continued to sustain a large part of its population, Nepal had begun to harness the potential of its picturesque landscapes, developing sustainable tourism that promised to preserve their natural heritage while boosting local economies. Communities living in the shadows of the Himalayas had become stewards of the earth, protecting the biodiversity that made their country unique.\n\nEach day brought new stories. Whether it was a festival in Kathmandu, a technological advance in Pokhara, or a conservation effort in Chitwan, these events were threads in the vibrant quilt of Nepali life. These stories, updated daily, reflected the pulse of progress and the spirit of hope that characterized this resilient nation.\n\nAnd so, as Nepal moved forward, each moment was not just a passage of time but a promise of potential, a narrative of a nation perennially climbing towards tomorrow, guided by the legacy of its past and the dreams of its future.\n\nNews events:\nNepal’s foreign direct investment commitment declined by 4.54 percent in the first four months of the current fiscal year until mid-November. The country’s power struggle continues to dampen investment and development for the country aspiring to graduate from the ranks of least developed countries in 2026.According to UN Trade and Development (UNCTAD), the UN institution dealing with trade and development globally, the decrease was primarily due to rising geopolitical tensions and concerns over “greenwashing”, a marketing practice to make things seem more environmentally friendly than they actually are.In Nepal, insiders say, an unstable political system that results in instability in critical policies is the main reason behind low FDI. Fitch, a credit ratings agency, concurs. According to the Department of Industry statistics, Nepal received investment pledges for Rs17.64 billion in 163 projects in the review period, which promises to generate employment for 8,180 people.“Recently, Nepal got a country credit rating of BB-, and everyone seems happy. But Nepal got BB- in non-investment grade, which means the country is not investment friendly and nor has there been an improvement in its business climate,” said Nara Bahadur Thapa, former executive director of the Nepal Rastra Bank.On November 21, Fitch Ratings assigned Nepal a long-term foreign-currency Issuer Default Rating (IDR) of 'BB-' with a stable outlook. The ratings reflect Nepal’s low and highly concessional government and external debt burdens, strong external liquidity and solid growth prospects underpinned by the hydropower sector.“Nepal got the BB- rating only because the foreign exchange reserve is in surplus, which will help in the repatriation of profit of foreign investors,” said Thapa.According to Fitch’s rating action commentary, Nepal has little external borrowing outside the public sector, reflecting its minimal foreign direct investment and limited integration into the global financial system. It said that burdensome procedures on profit repatriation and other regulations on external transactions have historically significantly constrained FDI inflows—but the authorities are addressing this.Fitch said frequent leadership changes in Nepal, eight changes of government since the beginning of 2014, with recurrent power struggles and shifting political alliances, have been undermining long-term policymaking and development planning.It warns that medium-term growth prospects weakened materially, for example, due to challenges in implementing development projects amid political instability, which could lead to negative rating action or downgrade.But there is a silver lining. Stable economic growth enables substantial increases in GDP per capita, potentially supported by improved governance standards and regulations conducive to private and foreign investments.“The country ceiling for Nepal is 'BB-', in line with the Long-Term Foreign-Currency IDR. This reflects no material constraints and incentives, relative to the IDR, against capital or exchange controls being imposed that would prevent or significantly impede the private sector from converting local currency into foreign currency and transferring the proceeds to non-resident creditors to service debt payments,” according to Fitch.“With a BB- rating, a narrative has been set that now is a good time to invest. But under this category, foreign investors will struggle here,” said Thapa.There are two grades in sovereign country rating. One is investment grade, and another is non-investment grade.A high-level economic reform committee has been formed, and it needs to look into improving the indicators listed for ease of doing business and gaining a BB status, said Thapa.In the first four months of the current fiscal year, investment commitments have mainly come for small-scale industries.The department received investment commitments of Rs13.17 billion for 159 projects, Rs275 million for a medium-scale project and Rs4.20 billion for three large-scale projects.The highest FDI commitment has come in the tourism sector, amounting to Rs11.58 billion for 119 projects.Similarly, Rs3.90 billion has been pledged for 21 service sector projects, Rs1.36 billion for 14 manufacturing projects, Rs600 million for three agro and forestry projects, and Rs174 million for five information and communication-based sector projects.The country received a commitment of Rs20 million for one mineral project.In the review period, the industry department recommended business visas for 900 investors, their 153 representatives, and 295 dependents.According to Nepal Rastra Bank, the country received net foreign direct investment of Rs4.81 billion in the first three months of the current fiscal year, which ended in mid-October.There is a significant gap between approved FDI and actual net FDI inflows into Nepal.Investment summits are held, and pledges made but they are not realised.Nepal needs to improve in 10 indicators of Doing Business, which used to be published by the World Bank but have now been discontinued.“There is a huge problem with tax payment in Nepal; it is filled with hassles. There are problems with company registration. There is no improvement in getting electricity and bank loans as there is no project loan service and a huge problem in repatriation. There have been no improvements on these indicators,” said Thapa.India tried to improve the FDI climate in line with Doing Business indicators, including an economy survey and budget. However, Nepal has not chosen a path for improvement.In the last fiscal year alone, only 13.57 percent of the committed Rs61.90 billion was realised, with actual foreign investment amounting to Rs8.40 billion.According to a report of Nepal Rastra Bank, between fiscal year 2014-15 and the last fiscal year, although substantial foreign investment commitments were made, a significant portion failed to enter the country.The trend shows that while foreign investment commitments have been increasing, the inflow of funds remains relatively low. Industry experts point out that no regulatory requirement mandates that all committed investments must be realised within the same fiscal period.The report said that the government allows investors to bring in funds in phases, contributing to the gap between commitment and realisation.During the third edition of the Nepal Investment Summit, which was held on April 28, the Department of Industry launched an automated route allowing foreign investors in Nepal to invest in sectors without requiring prior approval from other government authorities. The government adopted more flexible policies starting in fiscal year 2022–23 to address the shrinking FDI inflows. The minimum threshold for FDI was reduced from Rs50 million to Rs20 million in the fiscal year 2023-24. Additionally, new plans were announced to review sector-specific minimum investment requirements.The budget also mentions removing investment limits for the information technology sector, although the specifics are yet to be finalised, the central bank report said.But there is no improvement in the FDI flow.In the fiscal year 2021-22, a commitment of Rs54.15 billion was made for 295 industries, but the net FDI inflow was just Rs18.56 billion. \nThe first thing Nirmala Shakya’s and Jeroen Van den Bergh’s son did after he was born—besides drinking, sleeping and pooping—was break Nepali immigration law. “The fine we had to pay wasn’t a lot—that is not the problem,” Shakya says. “It is more the ridiculousness of it that gets to me.”Across the table from them, Bhagwati Bista giggles and nods. While Shakya and Van den Bergh don’t have the notice for the fine anymore, Bista can confirm their story. She was also fined for giving birth to her son.In both the couples—that of Shakya and Van den Bergh, and Bista and her husband—the woman is a Nepali citizen. The man and father of the child isn’t. The Nepali state automatically assumes the citizenship of the father for a child as per article 11 (7) of the constitution. Without the possibility of dual citizenship, these babies, even though born in Nepal to a Nepali parent, need a visa to stay in the country—or could go through a process to get a naturalised citizenship but not one by descent. It took a while for them to process their passports through the embassies and then another while to get them a visa, say both mothers. During this time, their children were considered illegal immigrants.While the baby-fines were, in practice, no more than a nuisance, they stand for something bigger for these families: The insecurity of their status, the absurdity of some rules, and the inequality built into the system—as this would not have happened had the fathers and not the mothers of these children were Nepali citizens.Shakya and Bista are no longer willing to accept all of this. They have both become members of a group of Nepalis married to foreigners. The goal of the group, named ‘Family Rights’, is to improve the status of their spouses without a Nepali citizenship. “We know the question of dual citizenship is an explosive one and that is not what we are pushing for,” says Manish Oli, one of the leaders of the group. “What we want is a residence status for our families.” Such a status already exists in Nepali immigration laws; but as of today, it can only be acquired if one invests large sums of money in Nepali companies or earns large salaries, but not on the grounds of a relationship.The ambiguityMost members of Family Rights have partners staying in Nepal on a marriage visa. The status is regulated under the immigration regulations of 1994 made under the Clause 8(h) of the immigration act of 1992. The status was always somewhat ambiguous. “We never had the explicit right to work,” says Paula, an Argentine citizen who has been living in Kathmandu since 2010. “But neither did someone explicitly tell us we could not.”Deepesh Ojha, a lawyer who specialises in immigration law, also says that the law on a marriage visa itself is rather vague. “It provides the right to reside in Nepal based on the fact that you are married to a citizen of Nepal,” he says. “Furthermore, the law is not clear regarding whether this entails the right to work in Nepal.”But then suddenly some of this ambiguousness disappeared. The shift was not to the liking of the foreigners with a marriage visa. The stampAccording to existing laws, a marriage visa has to be renewed every half year. For this, both spouses have to appear at the immigration office and pay a fee. “Around 2017, they suddenly added a ‘employment prohibited’ stamp to my visa,” Jeroen Van den Bergh takes out his passport and shows a page with that stamp on it. Also Manish Oli’s wife—a Russian citizen and a doctor—received the stamp. Both of the Olis were furious. “I started knocking on government offices, asking who had decided to start putting this stamp and why,” Oli says. “Nobody could answer me.” One day in 2020, just as suddenly as it had come to the scene, the stamp disappeared.By that time, Oli’s anger had built up to a fury about the insecure status of his family. He was not about to lay that fury to rest. Through social media he found out that Lopsang Nepali and Karma Tamang—both of them married to foreigners—had done largely the same—knock on authorities’ doors to get the stamp removed. Nepali had also started to collect signatures on a petition. The three got together and founded Family Rights in November 2023. The group currently has 303 members. In total, according to the group’s data, there are 1,400 families affected. The group has collected 124 signatures on their petition for a residence status for their spouses. Such a status, known to many countries, does not give citizenship or a right to vote. But it provides a certain degree of security.This security is what they crave, say the group members. Because while the circumstance that the spouses are not explicitly allowed to work is a problem, there are more severe ones. Many spouses work anyways. “You depend on the employer to take the risk, which is not great obviously,” says Paula, the Argentinian. But there are more issues.Who may stay?The foreign spouses are treated by the state like tourists in most respects: They pay tourist fares on flights and at hospitals, they cannot officially work, and they cannot own immovable property. But in one respect, they are treated even worse than tourists: The right of the foreigner to stay in the country is fully dependent on their spouse. Therefore, the most substantial problems appear in case the marriage ends—that is if either the Nepali partner dies or they divorce. “No matter how long you have been in the country, if you are here on a marriage visa, you have to leave the country,” Oli says.Immigration lawyer Ojha says it is true that marriage visas lose their validity as soon as the parties get divorced. “The question then is whether the foreigner can qualify for a different kind of visa.” That mostly depends on the exact constellation of the family. In case of death, Ojha says, a widow can get a visa through “in-person verification” of immediate family members of the deceased husband, according to section 4.4 (4) of the Immigration Rules of 2008. No specific provisions are made for the vice-versa case of a widower whose Nepali wife has died. This is not an option for divorcees: “In that case a relationship visa through the family of the ex-husband is not possible,” says Ojha. Also having a child with a Nepali citizen is not grounds per se to be granted a visa, even if that child is a minor, as there are no specific provisions for this case in the immigration rules.“These rules tear families apart,” says Manish Oli. “And that the right to be in Nepal is so immediately tied to the husband can keep especially women trapped in abusive relationships.” Consequences can get severe when one does not leave when ordered to. After the wife of the German citizen Manfred Neumann died in 2011, his marriage visa expired. After 34 years in the country, Neumann decided to stay anyway. When caught, he was sent to jail for three years—though the Supreme Court later quashed that punishment.The money questionThere is another big problem that often awaits foreigners soon after the death of their spouse or divorce: they are not allowed to own immovable property in Nepal as the section 432 of the civil code of 2017 bars the transfer of any immovable property to foreigners without a special permission from the government. “In case of a divorce, the foreign spouse is still entitled to some of the couple's assets. They are also entitled to inherit immovable property if the partner dies,” says Ojha. There is a big hurdle to that: While section 433 of the civil code of 2017 does allow for them to receive immovable property by partition or inheritance, the foreign spouse is then not allowed to own what they received in terms of immovable property. “What happens in practice is that they get a provisional ownership certificate valid solely for the transfer process,” says Ojha. “Then they immediately have to sell the property to a Nepali buyer.”Even if the foreigner has successfully sold their share of immovable property, there can be more problems. “They are not allowed to take major sums of money abroad,” says Ojha. The foreign exchange regulation act of 2019 regulates all cases in which repatriation of assets is allowed, and it does not make any provisions for such sales proceedings. So while the foreigner might have to leave, they can’t take their belongings with them.Little understandingThe residence status the group is pushing for should be crafted in a way to solve all of this, says Manish Oli. The group furthermore wants that the law be the same for all genders. Manish Oli and Lopsang Nepali say they met with a number of politicians over the past year, trying to convince them of their cause. They say they will keep knocking on the authorities’ doors for as long as it takes.A simple solution is already in place in India: The ‘Overseas Citizenship of India’ largely gives an individual the same right as the ‘Non Residential Nepali’ status but can also be acquired while residing in India. And in India the Overseas Citizenship can be extended to spouses and kids.“I agree that the Nepali immigration law needs an overhaul,” says Ojha, the lawyer. “Immigration laws today are very restrictive. We have to accommodate for new realities with the necessary flexibility. We are falling behind other countries that have already adopted more adaptable immigration policies.”The spokesperson of the Department of Immigration said that he cannot comment on whether the current laws are fair and if they will be changed. “It is up to the parliament to make the laws. We only implement.”Nirmala Shakya, the woman who was fined for giving birth to a Dutch son, says that when she explains their cause to their friends they often get little understanding. “Many people ask us why we didn’t just move to the Netherlands, where I actually would have many rights my husband does not have here,” Shakya says. “I find that a weird question. Our life is here. This is home for both of us.” \nWater bottles are kept in the wheelchair’s front part. There are packets of Dalmoth and Kurmure beside him. Cartons of noodles steal his space meant to keep his paralysed legs. Tej Bahadur Rawal, 52, thus manages a mobile shop on his wheelchair.“I move around the Mahendranagar Buspark area in a wheelchair and make a little bit of money,” says Rawal, who has spinal cord injuries. “It helps me earn and pass the time as well.”He says he earns around Rs400 to Rs500 on an average daily by selling goods mainly to the passengers who gather at the buspark area to board vehicles.Rawal reaches the Mahendranagar Buspark area at around 7 am every day with the help of his wife, Mina Devi. They bring lunch from their rented room in Aithapur, which is near Mahendranagar Bazaar. They return home in the evening after moving around Mahendranagar Buspark area and sometimes Mahendranagar Bazaar as well. The ‘wheelchair shop’ has been quite helpful for the Rawal couple in managing their household expenses.Tej Bahadur, a permanent resident of Amargadhi Municipality-6 of Dadeldhura district, was injured in People’s Movement-II, which was launched in 2006 to end king Gyanendra Shah’s direct rule and establish Loktantra. He sustained spinal cord injuries as security personnel had severely thrashed him during the peaceful movement in Dadeldhura.It was April 10, 2006. The uprising was at its peak. He joined the mass protest after taking his morning meal. Police personnel resorted to baton charges. He could not run away. The security personnel thrashed him so brutally that his spinal cord got broken.“I frequented Bareli to Delhi and Kathmandu. Big amounts of money were spent for the treatment. Neither I could save money nor was my treatment possible. My life was ruined,” says Tej Bahadur, informing that the government had provided Rs 450,000 for his treatment but he spent more mounts in a bid to get treatment.Tej Bahadur owned a bus. He used to drive his bus before his injuries and lived a decent life. “But things have changed now. Now I have to struggle to manage two squares of meals and the educational expenses of the children,” he says with a sigh.The Rawal couple has five children—three daughters and two sons. Two daughters are already married. Their youngest daughter has completed the Junior Technical Assistant course and currently stays at home. Tej Bahadur says he does not have money for her further studies. His eldest son quit studies when he was in grade 12 due to lack of money. He is working now as a daily wage earner. His youngest son is currently studying at bachelor level in Sudurpaschim University.“I have a large family. A huge amount of money is required to manage food,” Tej Bahadur says. “The government provides a monthly allowance but it is not enough to manage family expenses. We are staying on rent. The allowance is spent to pay rent.”Tej Bahadur receives a monthly allowance of Rs18,000. The federal government provides allowances to the injured victims of people’s movements as per their situation.Tej Bahadur frequently reached a general store near his residence to buy essentials. One day, the general store’s owner suggested selling goods on his wheelchair. Tej Bahadur took his suggestion positively and started selling goods in the Mahendranagar Buspark area. “I initially thought about how much I could earn money by selling water,” he recalls. “I started earning a little amount after some time.”It is all possible for Tej Bahadur due to his wife’s support, he says. Mina Devi takes him to the Buspark area and accompanies him in the business. She also supports Tej Bahadur by bringing goods from the general store. “We are doing it to eke out a living,” Meena Devi says. \nAmid a decline in temperatures, the number of people suffering from influenza and other respiratory ailments has risen. Hospitals treating respiratory patients say there has been an increase in flu and other respiratory illnesses compared to a few days ago.“A rise in cases of respiratory illnesses during winter or at the time of season change is not uncommon,” said Dr Ram Hari Chapagain, a senior consultant paediatrician at the Kanti Children’s Hospital. “Parents should not take these problems lightly, as children can sometimes develop severe symptoms.”Seasonal influenza is also highly contagious. It mainly affects the lungs and spreads quickly in communities. Its symptoms include fever, cough, body aches, and in some cases, vomiting and diarrhoea, and pneumonia.Pneumonia, an infection of the lungs caused by various types of bacteria, viruses and fungi, is the leading cause of death among children under five in Nepal. It kills more children annually than malaria, tuberculosis and HIV combined. According to the World Health Organisation, pneumonia accounts for 15 percent of under-five mortality.Doctors say pneumonia caused by bacteria is deadlier than that caused by viruses, and children under five and people above 65 years of age are highly vulnerable to the disease.Thousands of people across the country contract pneumonia every year. The average cost of hospitalisation for pneumonia is Rs13,250, which is nearly half the average monthly household expenses in Nepal, a study by Pneumo Nepal shows.The study—which was carried out at Patan Hospital, Kanti Children's Hospital, Mission Hospital in Palpa, Bheri Hospital in Nepalgunj, and BP Koirala Institute of Health Sciences—shows that unexpected medical costs often push families into poverty.Doctors warn that if seasonal influenza is left untreated, it can cause pneumonia, which can be fatal. Doctors say seasonal influenza affects not only children but also comorbid and elderly people equally.Although Nepal has no system in place to track influenza infections, severity, and deaths from influenza viruses, many people get severe infection from the disease, according to them.“We don’t know exactly how many people get infected, develop severe symptoms, or succumb to seasonal influenza each year in Nepal, as we do not maintain detailed records,” said Dr Anup Subedee, an infectious disease expert. “But the fact is small children, elderly people and those with underlying conditions are highly vulnerable.”Experts say most children recover within a few days of infection, but the virus could be severe to elderly people and those with underlying conditions.“The number of people suffering from seasonal flu, or influenza, has risen of late,” said Dr Sher Bahadur Pun, chief of the Clinical Research Unit at Sukraraj Tropical and Infectious Disease Hospital. “The increased flow of patients at pharmacies also indicates a rise in influenza cases.”Doctors say the number of people infected with seasonal influenza could be far more than recorded, as not all cases reach hospitals and undergo testing. Sometimes, even doctors do not think it necessary to carry out testing as there is no specific treatment for the infection.The seasonal influenza virus causes respiratory complications, mainly affecting the lungs. Experts say early diagnosis is crucial for preventing infection and complications. Patients recover early if treated promptly. However, the severity of the disease and deaths increase if seasonal influenza cases are not diagnosed on time.“Those who can afford to pay for influenza shots should get inoculated themselves along with children, elderly and people with comorbidities,” said Pun. “The influenza vaccine prevents severe infections.” \nToran Bikram Shahi extended the lead to three strokes after the second round of the Surya Nepal Central Open, the first event under Surya Nepal Golf Tour 2024-25, at the par-72 Gokarna Golf Club on Tuesday.Shahi carded second consecutive 5-under 67 for 36-hole total score of 10-under 134. He is three strokes ahead of second-placed Sunil KC, who carded 3-under 69 for a total score of 7-under 137. Nepal number one pro Bhuvan Nagarkoti slipped to third at 6-under 138 after he played 2-under 70.Amateur Rahul BK climbed to fourth overall at 5-under 139. He carded 3-under 69 and is four strokes ahead of Sadbhav Acharya in amateur section. Defending champion Acharya carded 3-under 69 to move up to second and sixth overall. Dharan pro Niraj Tamang is fifth overall at 3-under 141 after he carded 3-under 69 in the second round.Rajendra Thapa Magar (72) is seventh at even-par 144, while Jayram Shrestha (72) and amateur Vijay Shrestha Einhaus (72) are tied for eighth at 1-over 145. Bhuwan Kumar Rokka is at the 10th position with the total score of 2-over 146 after he played 3-over 75.A total of 27 golfers—21 pros and six amateurs—made it to the final two rounds after a cut fell at 13-over 157.Former top pro Rabi Khakda, Pradip Kumar Lama, Rajendra Shrestha Pradhan, Krishna Man Rajbahak, Deepak Magar, Dinesh Prajapati, Dhana Bahadur Thapa, Sanjay Lama, Ramesh Adhikari, Tanka Bahadur Karki, Surya Prasad Sharma, Ram Krishna Shrestha, Kumar Kami and Kishan Kaliraj Sunar survived the cut. In the amateur section, Surendra Phuyal, Gajendra Gurung and Shivaram Poudel are the other three players who made the cut.Leader Shahi took the turn at 3-under 33 and carded 2-under 34 on the back nine. He started off with a birdie on the first hole and added two more on the fifth and eighth holes on the bogey-free front nine. On the back nine, Shahi carded four birdies on the 11th, 12th, 13th and 16th holes but he also faced two bogeys on the 10th and 15th holes.KC carded 2-under 34 on the front nine and played a bogey-free 1-under 35 on the back nine. He dropped a shot on the third hole before carding birdies on the fourth, eighth and ninth holes. KC then carded a birdie on the 15th hole and saved pars on eight holes.Nagarkoti carded birdies on the third and seventh holes to take the turn at a bogey-free 2-under 34. He played even-par 36 on the back nine after he mixed three birdies with as many bogeys. He dropped shots on the 11th, 14th and 15th holes against birdies on the 12th, 16th and 17th holes.Amateur section leader BK carded bogey-free 3-under 33 on the front nine with the help of birdies on the third, seventh and eighth holes. He carded three more birdies on the 12th, 16th and 18th holes but was undone with a double bogey on the 14th and a bogey on the next hole. Defending champion Acharya took the turn at 3-under 33 and played even-par 36 on the back nine.The season-opening tournament of the Surya Nepal Golf Tour 2024-25 carries a cash purse of Rs882,000. Top three pros will receive Rs150,000, Rs100,000 and Rs75,000, respectively, while other pros in top 21 will get their share of cash prizes. \nAmid sluggish progress in law promulgation, the Legislation Management Committee of the National Assembly has decided to conduct a detailed study of the laws needed for the full-fledged implementation of the constitution promulgated around a decade ago.The committee has formed a five-member sub-committee led by Beduram Bhusal, a CPN (Unified Socialist) lawmaker to assess the progress made in law promulgation and also find out how many laws, and from which sector, still need to be enacted. The sub-committee has been given a month for the study and submit a report.The committee, after a similar study last year, had found that only 111 laws among the 151 required to implement the 2015 constitution had been enacted by July 2023. It had pointed out that 40 Acts needed either major amendments or replacement to bring them in sync with the constitution.Appearing before the upper house, then prime minister, Pushpa Kamal Dahal, had said the government was serious towards drafting the necessary bills and registering them in the federal parliament. But his government failed to walk the talk. The incumbent government too has not made serious attempts to introduce these necessary bills.“The sub-committee will study what progress has been made since last year,” said Tulasa Kumari Dahal, chairperson of the House committee. “It will study minutely as to which ministry needs which laws to implement the constitution.”Once the Bhusal-led panel submits its report, the House committee will hold discussion with the prime minister and relevant ministers. “We will try to seek explanations for the delay and instruct the government to expedite the preparations of the necessary bills,” she said.The constitution had set two deadlines to prepare laws for its implementation. It mandated the passage of laws related to fundamental rights within three years of the charter’s promulgation. The federal parliament endorsed the bills related to 31 fundamental rights a day before the constitutional deadline of September 19, 2018.As per the statute, the Acts that contradict the constitution must have been revised within a year since the first meeting of the federal parliament on March 5, 2018. Though several laws were enacted, dozens are still waiting for parliamentary approval.One major constitutional mandate involves devolving authority to manage school education from the federal government to local governments. However, the federal education law has yet to be enacted. Similarly, the federal civil service bill is also stuck in a parliamentary committee.Other crucial laws, including those related to health, citizenship and the authority of the President and Vice President have also not been enacted.The report says some of the laws in force date back as far back as 1953. Similarly, dozens of Acts are from the Panchayat era (1961-1990). For instance, the Education Act from 1972 and Infectious Disease Act from 1962 remain in force.In its report, the House committee had instructed the government to revise the Panchayat era laws to align with the present day needs. However, little progress has been made in this regard.It is the government that prepares bills and registers them in parliament. They become the Act, only after they get through both the Houses of the federal parliament and receive the Presidential seal. The government, however, solely is not responsible for the delay in having the necessary laws in place. Failure of the House committees in readying the bills to be tabled for the endorsement too is equally responsible for the delay. For instance, different House committees are sitting on 16 bills for months. Despite repetitive instructions from Speaker Devraj Ghimire, the House panels also called mini-parliaments have not been active.The upcoming winter session of the House, known as bills session, is likely to be without substantial business because neither the House committees have finalized the pending bills nor has the government registered new bills. It has been more than four months since the last bill was registered.  \nThe annual United Nations climate summit, COP29, where nations discuss the future of climate, wrapped up last Sunday in Baku, Azerbaijan. Even as nations fought hard to reach a fair deal, the conference ended with a new climate finance target or New Collective Quantified Goal (NCQG) of at least $300 billion a year by 2035. Some representatives stood from their seats and applauded; however, delegates from developing nations felt insulted and labelled the $300 billion a “paltry sum” as it is simply not enough to address their mounting climate concerns. Even though the pledge has tripled from the previous target of $100 billion, which expires at the end of this year, it is less than the $400-$900 billion that many developing countries demanded from wealthy nations. The NCQG serves as a financial tool for justice, holding developed nations accountable for a climate crisis that disproportionately affects poorer countries. Yet, the escalating climate crisis each year has not been matched by a proportional increase in climate finance to address it. According to a 2024 OECD/IEA report, only $179 billion of the $1,265 billion tracked in global climate mitigation and adaptation finance from 2021-22 went to developing nations, with just $30 billion allocated to the least developed countries (LDCs).Developing nations like ours need this fund to adapt to climate change as they progress. Climate change impacts are not equally distributed. Nepal is one of the most climate change-vulnerable countries globally, although it contributes a negligible 0.02 percent share of global carbon emissions. This means that the climate-induced disasters the nation is grappling with, like floods, droughts, heatwaves, glacial lake outburst floods (GLOF), and so on, are outcomes of global climate change, a crisis fueled mainly by the inaction of nations with substantial carbon footprints. This is the sad reality of several South Asian nations: By 2050, Bangladesh will lose 17 percent of its territory due to rising sea levels, around 90 percent of India lies in extreme heat danger zones, and Pakistan became the 5th most vulnerable country to climate change last year according to Global Climate Risk Index. Considering our susceptibility to climate change, platforms like COP are vital to inform the world about our experiences and demand the compensation we deserve. Nepal’s COP-29 priorities this year focused on safeguarding its mountains, ensuring promised climate finance, enhancing access to climate funds, and urging the expedited implementation of the loss and damage fund established last year. Under the leadership of President Ramchandra Paudel, Nepal conducted a high-level session on climate change, during which he talked about the impacts of the melting of snow in the mountains. Nepal’s participation in the previous iterations of the UN climate summit hasn’t been that impressive. Negotiating and presenting on such platforms require experience, research and preparation. More than anything, it demands sensitivity towards climate change, which our leaders seemingly do not possess. Besides setting an NCQG, this year’s COP also delivered global standards for carbon trading and mandated all 195 Paris signatories to announce more ambitious emission targets by February 2025. However, concerns over Donald Trump’s re-election as the US president overshadowed these developments at the summit. The US, even though it is the world’s second-largest emitter after China, withdrew from the Paris Agreement during Trump’s first term. Although climate finance this year did not meet the expectations of developing nations, it cannot be rejected, especially with the rise of right-wing politicians who are indifferent to the climate crisis. Regardless, Nepal must strengthen its domestic climate change policies and enhance its negotiating and communication skills internationally. It should also collaborate with other developing nations that are experiencing the negative impacts of climate change. It is time we stopped ignoring the elephant in the room.  \nThe formal implementation of federalism in Nepal began after the three-tier elections in 2017. As it completes its seventh year, the journey to effective implementation remains fraught with challenges. The recent Kantipur Conclave (November 13-14) brought together the chief ministers of all provinces to discuss the progress, hurdles and opportunities in federal governance in a session titled “Face to Face with Chief Ministers”. Their insights shed light on the practical realities of federalism, revealing gaps in legislation, administrative autonomy, fiscal federalism and intergovernmental relations.Chief ministers highlighted several shared concerns about federalism's implementation. Hikmat Karki, Chief Minister of Koshi Province, said that provinces are given a “treasure bag without money,” referring to the lack of fiscal autonomy. He pointed out that while Koshi Province has made progress, such as reforming the vehicle licensing system, it still faces significant barriers due to the absence of enabling legislation and institutional support from the federal government. Similarly, Satish Kumar Singh, Chief Minister of Madhesh Province, echoed the frustration over the gap between rights and resources. He compared Nepal’s federalism with India’s, highlighting how Indian states are empowered with resources and authority to implement their mandates. Singh called for more clarity in resource allocation and legislative framework and emphasised the need for regular evaluation and accountability for civil servants.The struggle for autonomy and functionality is not confined to these provinces. Chief Minister Bahadur Singh Lama of Bagmati Province pointed to a lack of laws governing exclusive and shared powers as a fundamental issue, despite his province achieving over 70 percent budget utilisation. Surendra Raj Pandey of Gandaki Province articulated similar concerns. He metaphorically described how federalism is stuck in a “2G framework” while governance demands have moved into a “5G era”. Pandey emphasised that the delayed enactment of critical federal laws, such as the Federal Police Act and the Education Act, prevents provinces from functioning effectively. He criticised the centralised mindset of political leaders and bureaucrats, which stymies the progress of federalisation.Acting Chief Minister Bhumeswar Dhakal of Lumbini Province stressed that provinces are the backbone of federalism and pivotal for connecting government to the people. He expressed frustration over the federal government’s failure to release grants on time and clarify shared powers. Meanwhile, Yam Lal Kandel of Karnali Province focused on the need for equitable resource allocation. He criticised the centralised governance model, arguing that it perpetuates disparities between provinces. Kandel called for timely legislation and structural alignment to enable provinces to fulfil their constitutional mandates and address development gaps.Kamala Bahadur Shah, the Chief Minister of Sudurpaschim Province, shed light on bureaucratic resistance. He shared an anecdote where a government secretary denied provincial authority but exerted control when operating in Kathmandu. According to Shah, this duality highlights the reluctance among bureaucrats to embrace federalism. He urged leaders to adopt a federal mindset and foster collaboration to strengthen governance at all levels.Despite challenges, chief ministers also shared some successes and opportunities. For example, the vehicle licensing reform in Koshi Province and Bagmati Province’s high budget utilisation demonstrate that provinces can deliver tangible results when given authority and resources. However, these isolated successes cannot mask the persisting systemic issues across provinces.At the Kantipur Conclave, their concerns were similar to those raised during programmes organised in all provincial capitals by the Federalism and Localization Centre, facilitated by the chief ministers’ offices in September 2024.Federalism is a shared responsibility, and its success depends on the collective efforts of federal, provincial and local governments. Chief ministers emphasised that the federal government must lead by example, demonstrating a commitment to federalisation and creating an enabling environment for provinces to thrive.Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli also addressed the conclave, emphasising the government's commitment to enacting laws that will provide reasonable powers to the provinces in line with the constitution. In response to concerns raised by the chief ministers regarding the lack of essential resources, such as financial autonomy and police powers, Oli acknowledged that the federal government has yet to enact laws that would fully empower the provinces. However, he assured that such laws would be made to ensure that provinces receive the rights they are entitled to.Prime Minister Oli's message, however, was not entirely encouraging for the provinces. He suggested that rather than focusing on “Sanduk ra Banduk” (fiscal resources and police authority), provinces should prioritise working with ideas and enthusiasm. Drawing on the example of Mahatma Gandhi, who achieved monumental change without weapons or fiscal resources, Oli emphasised that “thoughts” and “enthusiasm” are key to progress, suggesting that provinces should cultivate a mindset of innovation and dedication rather than waiting for more powers to be granted.While his statement reflected optimism and a call for action, it highlighted a more cautious approach toward empowering the provinces, contrasting with the urgency the provincial leaders expressed.The insights shared by the chief ministers at the conclave serve as a roadmap for strengthening federalism in Nepal. Their voices underscore the need for clear laws, robust institutions and a commitment to federalisation and inclusivity. Addressing legislative gaps, empowering provinces with resources and authority and fostering a decentralised mindset are critical steps toward realising the promise of federalism.As Nepal navigates its federal journey, these lessons must guide its path toward more effective and equitable governance. By tackling the systemic issues collectively, Nepal can fulfil the promise of federalism and build a governance system that serves its diverse population. The conclave provided a platform for these critical discussions, and it is now up to the stakeholders to act on these insights and strengthen the federal framework. Federalism in Nepal remains a work in progress, but with concerted efforts, it holds the potential to transform governance and empower provinces to become engines of development and inclusivity. \nDonald Trump, a convicted felon, an unashamed racist, an unapologetic misogynist, a habitual liar, a climate change denier, and a twice-impeached former President, returned to the White House through democratic elections, fair and square. Trump's victory shocked many, but this is not the first time a malignant personality has been elected to a high office.Hitler also rose to power through a legitimate democratic process. He convinced the German voters that the German Jews were behind the humiliation Germany suffered under the Treaty of Versailles. He blamed the Jews for collaborating with the enemies in the First World War and called them “vermin.” The strategy worked. He got elected, became a dictator, and killed an estimated 6 million Jews. Emulating Hitler, Trump blamed immigrants, particularly illegal immigrants, for all of America's woes, from crime to economy to housing to health care, and threatened to expel the estimated 11 million “illegals”. Like Hitler, the president-elect called his opponents at home “vermin”. It worked. Pundits, professors, pollsters and significant newspaper columnists, who until a day before the election were predicting a close election, are now in overdrive dissecting the unexpected result—what Harris and the Democrats did wrong that culminated in Trump's triumph and what will be the impact of the four years of the Trump administration domestically and internationally. Surprisingly, these analyses do not explore the deficiencies in the United States Constitution that enabled an unrepentant felon to rise to unchecked power. The American Constitution The US Constitution is the world's first national constitution, ratified in 1788. A product of a compromise among various warring colonies, the slave owners in the South, and antislavery citizens in the North, it was a remarkable document at the time and is still in force. However, many of its requirements are inconsistent with modern times—for example, the allocation of Senate seats. The Constitution allocates two seats to every state, regardless of population size. Thus, California, with a population of nearly 40 million, and Wyoming, with a population of about 500,000, have two seats each in the Senate, contrary to the fundamental tenet of modern democracies where population sizes determine the number of representatives. The skewed system gives the smaller states an oversized voice in the powerful Senate, a significant advantage to the Republican Party with a stronghold in these states. It was this undemocratic Senate which refused to ratify Trump's impeachment by Congress twice and bar him from future elections. The lifetime tenure of the Supreme Court judges is another serious flaw in the Constitution. Lifetime tenure was intended to insulate justices from partisan politics. “Once a justice is confirmed and takes a seat on the court, they're not beholden to anybody”. But those ideas have gone by the wayside as the President's nominations to the court have become increasingly partisan. Flags symbolising opposition to the outcome of the 2020 election, which Trump lost, have been displayed on the front grounds of a Supreme Court judge’s home; the wife of one of the judges has been found working with those conspiring to subvert the 2020 election. Conservative judges, who call themselves “originalists” (while deciding a case, they interpret the Constitution as the founders would have interpreted it), are in the majority in the Supreme Court. How they get into the heads of these 18th-century men is anyone's guess, but in most Trump-related litigations, they have decided in Trump's favour. The Supreme Court could not or would not stop a felon from contesting election to the highest office in the land, while many ordinary felons are not even allowed to vote. One recent decision of the Court was to grant the President immunity for all his actions as head of the Executive branch. Dissenting Justice Sonia Sotomayor warned that the decision would set future presidents as “a king above the law”. With control of both Houses of Congress and a Supreme Court stacked with a majority of compliant conservatives, Trump will have a near-absolute grip on all the levers of American power for at least two years until the midterm elections. The checks and balances imagined in America's 1788 Constitution will be virtually ineffective for these two years unless Congressional Republicans show some spine and rise to challenge Trump's excesses. If they don’t, Trump’s monopoly of power will continue for the entire four years of his term unless the mid-term elections change the control of the House of Congresses. If Trump does everything he has promised—and given the appointments in his administration announced to date, there is no reason to believe he won't—the United States will be in serious conflict with itself in the coming four years. Its impact will be felt worldwide, not just in economic and military matters but also culturally. Impact on NepalTrump is a highly transactional individual. He will only give something away if he gets something back in return and with a profit. Under Trump, the volume of US aid to Nepal will likely depend on the degree of Nepal's collaboration with the administration in pushing its agenda to challenge China's growing global influence. Given Trump's anti-immigrant bias, in the coming four years, the number of visas granted to Nepalis is likely to reduce significantly; there will be no Diversity Visa (DV), no family-sponsored Green Cards (Trump has consistently opposed both DV visas and family Green Cards); and naturalised Americans, like other naturalised citizens, will be under constant threat of denaturalisation for the slightest infringement of US laws. An accomplished Nepali engineer who came to the United States in 1992 told me, “There is no certainty that Trump will not resume the aggressive denaturalisation process he started in his first term”. Trump's victory will also have a significant cultural impact on future generations in the US and around the world, including Nepal. Upon confirmation of Trump's victory, my seven-year-old granddaughter quipped, “Now I can say and do anything I want”. Thinking of children growing up with such a mindset is worrying. There is no doubt Trump's behaviour over the last eight years provides a feeder to our political leaders who are unashamedly corrupt and have a penchant for personal insults and dehumanisation of their opponents. If the American President can do it, why not us? Trump's election was America's moral collapse. With control of both houses of Congress and a compliant Supreme Court, the democratic levers of change in America are now near nonexistent. Trump is virtually the only source of power, the “king above the law”. This is not good for America or the rest of the world, including Nepal.I hear the echo of my feelings about Trump's election in the words of a celebrated Canadian journalist, Andrew Cohen: “All my life, I have been an admirer of the United States and its people. But I am frightened of it now, and I am even more frightened of them”. \nKarnali Province has worryingly become synonymous with tragic road accidents, with deaths and injuries getting far too frequent. We aren’t even halfway through this fiscal year, and as many as 48 people have already died on Karnali’s roads. According to the Provincial Police Office in Surkhet, just in the second week of November, 17 accidents resulted in 12 fatalities and 132 injuries. And in the past five years, a total of 666 people in the province died for the same reason. This alarming data hints at systemic negligence and calls for immediate remedial action.Karnali’s rugged topography is well-known, presenting natural challenges to smooth transport. But the blame for these accidents cannot be attributed solely on the province’s layout. In areas with a limited number of vehicles, reckless bus operators overload them, which contributes to accidents. Recently, a five-seater jeep jam-packed with 32 people crashed at Raduneta of Palata Rural Municipality-3 in Kalikot district, killing seven and injuring 13 others. Moreover, the vehicle operators tend to deceive the police by asking some passengers to get off the bus at security check-posts so the overcrowding goes unnoticed. The passengers are left with no option but to accept such wretched conditions, often out of necessity. The vehicle operators also justify their actions by claiming they cannot bar people who want to get inside packed buses, especially on routes where public transport is scarce. Such problems could have been averted if the province had good roads and enough vehicles. The Karnali Highway was blacktopped eight years ago, but the asphalt has eroded in sections, making accidents more likely. Inaugurated in 1992 and operated in 2007, the state of the highway remains sub-par and inadequate to meet the province’s demands. Besides the Karnali Highway, Rapti, Mid-Hill Highway and other road sections also need upgrade and widening. Landslides during the monsoon obstruct these roads and pose danger to travellers. This absence of proper road infrastructure has not just affected the local people but also harmed Karnali’s tourism prospects and undercut its development aspirations. There isn’t much interest, either at the federal or provincial level, in improving the state of Karnali’s roads. The focus of elected officials seems to be to open new tracks on unstable soil just to show that development has ‘arrived’ in Karnali. The region’s challenges are examples of systemic neglect. While it is commendable that many remote areas are now connected by roads, these paths should also be relatively safe and easy to traverse. Given such a large number of deaths and injuries, the federal and provincial governments should prioritise road safety as a matter of urgency. Drivers, police and passengers—none of them can escape their responsibility while blaming the others for the accidents. They would all be better served if they joined hands to put pressure on governments to enhance the quality of roads and collaborate with the private sector to bring more vehicles to the province. Monitoring and supervision activities along the stretch of the Karnali Highway, where most accidents take place—from Bangesimal in Surkhet to Khalanga in Jumla—should be another priority. Nowhere in Nepal should people have to put their lives on the line while travelling for essential business.  \nThe Millennium Challenge Account Nepal (MCA-Nepal) has relaunched the call for bids to construct a 297-km power transmission line.The transmission line to be built under the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) Nepal Compact will strengthen Nepal’s power transmission network, the MCA Nepal said in a statement on Wednesday.The bid submission deadline is set for January 30, 2025. Construction is divided into three lots: Lapsiphedi-Ratmate-New Hetauda, Ratmate-New Damauli, and New Damauli-New Butwal. According to the MCA Nepal, the relaunch follows a comprehensive review of the previous bidding process and includes design optimisations, improved access to tower locations, and updates to commercial terms based on bidders’ feedback.These adjustments address the main cost drivers identified in the initial bids, ensuring more feasible and cost-effective proposals, it said. On August 30, the MCA-Nepal successfully awarded Transrail Lighting Ltd. a US$12.36 million contract to construct the 18-km Nepal portion of the Butwal-Gorakhpur transmission line, which will be completed within 21 months.“After securing the contract for the 18-km segment, we are confident the redesigned requirements for the remaining 297-km will attract strong market interest and competitive bids,” said Khadga Bahadur Bisht, executive director of the MCA-Nepal. The MCA Nepal said the relaunch marks another milestone in the progress of the MCC Nepal Compact, which has made significant progress over the past year.With contractors already working on the three 400kV substations and the 18-km transmission line, the MCA-Nepal is on track to implement the remaining segments, further strengthening Nepal’s energy infrastructure, it said.The MCA-Nepal is committed to the successful execution of this procurement and the transmission line construction works while meeting the environmental and social standards of both the government of Nepal and the MCC, reads the statement.The projects built under the MCC Nepal compact must be completed within five years after the compact came into force in the last week of August this year. Nepal’s Parliament ratified the much-debated MCC compact in February 2022, following an agreement in 2017 between the government and the MCC. The MCC compact signing opened the way for the United States to invest $500 million in Nepal’s power and transport infrastructure. The government of Nepal, on its part, contributes $197 million in support of the compact. \nA ceasefire between Israel and Iran-backed group Hezbollah came into effect at 0200 GMT on Wednesday after U.S. President Joe Biden said both sides accepted an agreement brokered by the United States and France.Bursts of gunfire could be heard across Beirut after the ceasefire took effect. It was not immediately clear if the shooting was celebratory, as gunfire had also been used to alert residents who may have missed evacuation warnings issued by Israel’s military.Streams of cars began heading to southern Lebanon, which borders Israel, after the ceasefire early on Wednesday, according to Reuters witnesses.The ceasefire promises to end a conflict across the Israeli-Lebanese border that has killed thousands of people since it was ignited by the Gaza war last year.Biden spoke at the White House on Tuesday shortly after Israel’s security cabinet approved the agreement in a 10-1 vote. He said he had spoken to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Lebanon’s caretaker Prime Minister Najib Mikati, and that fighting would end at 4 a.m. local time (0200 GMT).“This is designed to be a permanent cessation of hostilities,” Biden said. “What is left of Hezbollah and other terrorist organizations will not be allowed to threaten the security of Israel again.”Israel will gradually withdraw its forces over 60 days as Lebanon’s army takes control of territory near its border with Israel to ensure that Hezbollah does not rebuild its infrastructure there, Biden said.“Civilians on both sides will soon be able to safely return to their communities,” he said.Hezbollah has not formally commented on the ceasefire but senior official Hassan Fadlallah told Lebanon’s Al Jadeed TV that while it supported the extension of the Lebanese state’s authority, the group would emerge from the war stronger.“Thousands will join the resistance ... Disarming the resistance was an Israeli proposal that fell through,” said Fadlallah, who is also a member of Lebanon’s parliament.Iran, which backs Hezbollah, the Palestinian group Hamas as well as the Houthi rebels that have attacked Israel from Yemen, has not publicly commented on the ceasefire.French President Emmanuel Macron said on social-media platform X the deal was “the culmination of efforts undertaken for many months with the Israeli and Lebanese authorities, in close collaboration with the United States.”Lebanon’s Mikati issued a statement welcoming the deal. Foreign Minister Abdallah Bou Habib said the Lebanese army would have at least 5,000 troops deployed in southern Lebanon as Israeli troops withdrew.Netanyahu said he was ready to implement a ceasefire but would respond forcefully to any violation by Hezbollah.He said the ceasefire would allow Israel to focus on the threat from Iran, give the army an opportunity to rest and replenish supplies, and isolate Hamas, the Palestinian militant group that triggered war in the region when it attacked Israel from Gaza last year.‘Set it back decades’“In full coordination with the United States, we retain complete military freedom of action. Should Hezbollah violate the agreement or attempt to rearm, we will strike decisively,” Netanyahu said.Hezbollah, which is allied to Hamas, was considerably weaker than it had been at the start of the conflict, he added.“We have set it back decades, eliminated ... its top leaders, destroyed most of its rockets and missiles, neutralized thousands of fighters, and obliterated years of terror infrastructure near our border,” he said.A senior U.S. official, briefing reporters on condition of anonymity, said the U.S. and France would join a mechanism with the UNIFIL peacekeeping force that would work with Lebanon’s army to deter potential violations of the ceasefire. U.S. combat forces would not be deployed, the official said.Jon Finer, deputy national security adviser in the Biden administration, told CNN that Washington would be watching for any violations of the deal.“Implementation of this agreement will be key and we will be very vigilant to any attempts to disrupt what the two parties have committed to as part of this process today,” he said.Biden, who leaves office in January, said his administration would continue to push for an elusive ceasefire and hostage-release deal in Gaza, as well as for a deal to normalize relations between Israel and Saudi Arabia.In the hours leading up to the ceasefire, hostilities raged as Israel ramped up its campaign of airstrikes in Beirut and other parts of Lebanon, with health authorities reporting at least 18 killed.The Israeli military said it struck “components of Hezbollah’s financial management and systems” including a money-exchange office.Hezbollah also kept up rocket fire into Israel.Israel’s air force intercepted three launches from Lebanese territory, the military said, in an extensive missile barrage on Tuesday night that led to warning alarms in about 115 settlements.Alia Ibrahim, a mother of twin girls from the southern village of Qaaqaiyat al-Snawbar, who had fled nearly three months ago to Beirut, said she hoped Israeli officials, who have expressed contradictory views on a ceasefire, would be faithful to the deal.“Our village – they destroyed half of it. In these few seconds before they announced the ceasefire, they destroyed half our village,” she said. “God willing, we can go back to our homes and our land.”A poll conducted by Israel’s Channel 12 TV found that 37% of Israelis were in favour of the ceasefire, compared with 32% against.Opponents to the deal in Israel include opposition leaders and heads of towns near Israel’s border with Lebanon, who want a depopulated buffer zone on Lebanon’s side of the frontier.Both the Lebanese government and Hezbollah have insisted that a return of displaced civilians to southern Lebanon is a key tenet of the truce.Israeli Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, a right-wing member of Netanyahu’s government, said on X the agreement did not ensure the return of Israelis to their homes in the country’s north and that the Lebanese army did not have the ability to overcome Hezbollah.“In order to leave Lebanon, we must have our own security belt,” Ben-Gvir said. \nThe Meteorological Forecasting Division has said that hilly regions of Koshi, Bagmati, Gandaki, and Karnali Provinces will experience partly cloudy weather today, while the rest of the country will see mainly fair conditions.Light rain is likely in one or two places in the hilly areas of Koshi, Bagmati, and Gandaki Provinces, with chances of light snowfall in the high-altitude regions of Koshi and Gandaki.Tonight, partly cloudy weather will persist in the hilly regions of Koshi, Bagmati, and Gandaki, with light rain expected in some areas of Koshi and Gandaki.The division attributes these conditions to the influence of westerly winds.Bhairahawa recorded the highest temperature at 27.5°C on Tuesday while Jumla experienced the lowest at -4.5°C.Taplejung reported traces of rainfall, the only location with precipitation in the past 24 hours. \nThe top-performing Nepali cricketer of the Nepal Premier League (NPL) T20 cricket tournament will be rewarded with a brand new car as Omoda & Jaecoo Nepal, on Tuesday, joined the franchise league as one of the co-sponsors.Cricket Association of Nepal (CAN) Secretary Paras Khadka and Gaurav Sharda, director of SPG Automobiles Private Limited, signed a Memorandum of Understanding during a function in Kathmandu.SPG Automobiles is the authorised distributor of Omoda & Jaecoo Automobiles.“The best Nepali player of the Nepal Premier League will now get a car from Sharda Group,” Khadka said following the deal.Director Sharda said that the involvement of Omoda & Jaecoo is aimed at elevating the cricket milestone in Nepal, further adding that the partnership will aim to enhance the Nepali cricket development and contribute to leverage the cricketing scenario.-Action Sports to stream NPL on YouTube-The matches of the NPL will also be available for online viewers via the official YouTube channel of Action Sports, according to Brand Digital Logiq, a digital marketing agency in Nepal managing NPL’s commercial rights.An agreement regarding YouTube streaming rights was signed on Tuesday between Brand LogiQ and Dish Media Network.The television broadcasts will be aired live on Star Sports.The NPL is scheduled to take place from November 30 to December 16 at the TU Cricket Ground in Kirtipur. \nThe price of gold in the Nepali market has continued to decline.On Tuesday, the price of gold dropped by Rs2,600 per tola (11.664 grams) to Rs148,700, according to the Federation of Nepal Gold and Silver Dealers Association. Silver also saw a decrease, dropping by Rs25 per tola to Rs1,820. This follows a significant drop on Monday when gold prices plummeted by Rs15,900 per tola after the government cut the customs duty on gold from 20 percent to 10 percent. The price of hallmark gold was set at Rs151,300 per tola on Monday, down from Rs167,200 on Sunday. The decision to slash the duty on gold customs was made during a cabinet meeting on Thursday. This move aims to address the imbalance caused by Nepal’s higher gold duty compared to India's, which recently reduced its duty from 15 percent to 6 percent. The disparity had encouraged illegal trade through the open border. The Federation has suggested that Nepal set the customs duty at 8 percent to help curb smuggling. \nNepal secured their second consecutive win in the ongoing Blind Cricket T20 World Cup, defeating South Africa by 11 runs in a closely contested match on Tuesday.The match, part of the tournament being held in Pakistan, saw Nepal batting first and setting a challenging target of 199 runs. Nepal's Naresh Chaudhary was the standout performer, scoring a brilliant 80 runs. The team finished their innings at 198 for the loss of four wickets in 20 overs.Chasing the target, South Africa managed 187 runs for the loss of two wickets in their allotted 20 overs. Despite an unbeaten century (100 runs) by South African batsman Bule Vidhale, the team fell short of the target.This victory follows Nepal’s win against Afghanistan on Monday, after losing their first two matches against Sri Lanka and Bangladesh. With this win, Nepal’s chances of securing a spot in the semifinals have significantly improved.The tournament features six teams: Nepal, India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, and South Africa. \nDuring monsoon last year, the Chandannath Municipality of Jumla district reported several cases of dengue. The local unit has reported cases of infection from the deadly virus this year too.Although most cases were locally transmitted, health workers in the district don’t consider the virus spread a serious public health problem. This is because Jumla is among the coldest places in the country, with temperatures dipping to subzero levels in the winter.Studies, however, show a disturbing development.“My study shows the presence of Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes and their larvae in Chandannath Municipality,” said Buddhi Ram Oli, a PhD scholar at the Central Department of Zoology of the Tribhuvan University. “Chandannath Municipality is located at an elevation of 2,438 metres, and this is the first time that dengue virus-spreading mosquitoes and their larvae have been found at such a high altitude.”Earlier, vectors spreading the deadly disease were recorded only up to 2,100 metres.Local residents and health officials serving in Jumla are aware of the presence of vectors spreading deadly diseases and growing number of infections. But they don’t take the issue seriously, thinking that the vectors cannot survive long due to the climatic conditions of the region.“We once met officials at District Health Office Jumla and discussed launching an awareness drive and destroying breeding sites of mosquitoes,” said Chhatra Bahadur Mahat, health coordinator at the Chandannath Municipality. “But neither does the health office provide a budget for such programmes nor does the local unit allocate any funds. So we couldn’t do anything.”Along with Jumla, all districts across the country have recorded dengue infections this year.Oli, who carried out vector surveillance, said that, as in Chandannath Municipality, health workers at other local units too have not taken the risk of the virus-spread seriously.Experts say the country’s health workers and health facilities are ill prepared to cope with the emerging public health challenges brought about by climate change. Several health facilities were overwhelmed with dengue patients this year, too. Due to a lack of beds, patients were forced to sleep in corridors, on the floor, on chairs, in storerooms, and out in the hospital compound. Hospitals even lacked basic supplies like IV stands, and patients’ visitors had to hold the IV bags or health workers had to improvise by tying them to windows.Experts say the deadly virus outbreak in most mountain districts and all hill districts shows the impact of climate change on Nepal’s healthcare system. Despite these challenges, no effective mitigation measures have been adopted.Many hospitals are overwhelmed with an influx of patients, and health workers are forced to place seriously ill patients in corridors and other makeshift spaces, compromising patient safety.“Our health facilities are not equipped to endure the climate crisis,” said Dr Meghnath Dhimal, chief researcher at the Nepal Health Research Council. “Many are built on hilltops or riverbanks and are vulnerable to climate impacts. These health facilities are also unprepared for emerging problems and surges in patient flow.”Experts say climate change, along with some other factors, such as increased mobility and improved transportation, has been contributing to the spread of deadly diseases in places considered no-risk zones in the past.“The rise in the temperature caused by climate change provides a conducive environment for dengue vectors to thrive and spread in the mountainous areas,” said Dhimal. “Risks posed by climatic factors cannot be ignored or underestimated.”A report by the United Nations titled ‘Climate Change 2022: Impacts, Adaptation and Vulnerability’ states that at least six major vector-borne diseases have recently emerged in Nepal and are now considered endemic, with climate change implicated as the primary driver.The report also showed increasing evidence that climate change has extended the elevational distribution of Anopheles, Culex and Aedes mosquitoes, which carry viruses to above 2,000 metres in Nepal.Dengue is a viral disease transmitted by female Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes. According to the World Health Organisation, the same vector also transmits chikungunya, yellow fever, and the Zika virus.So far, 12 people have died due to dengue and over 29,000 have been infected since the start of 2024 if the government data is to be believed. Experts say reported dengue cases may only represent a small fraction of the true scale of the outbreak, as around 90 percent of the infected people do not show any symptoms and health authorities often conceal the actual number of deaths and infections.This year, districts in Tarai region reported fewer cases of dengue infection than districts in the hills and mountains. Experts attribute this to the residents of Tarai’s becoming more aware of the deadly virus and taking preventive measures. High temperatures (above 35 degrees Celsius) could also have contributed to less infection, as mosquito vectors do not survive above 35 degrees Celsius.Over the past few years, dengue has become a year-round threat in Nepal, with cases consistently on the rise. \nManufacturers and exporters say they are in a dilemma over trade with India following the restrictive measures imposed by New Delhi on Nepali goods. Making matters worse is the Nepali government’s silence even though the goods have not been sold to India for months.Dol Raj Adhikari, president of the Nepal Sanitary and Diaper Association, said sanitary pads and diapers worth of Rs250 million had been stranded in the warehouses for the past three months.“We completed all the processes to acquire the Bureau of Indian Standards [BIS] certificate to export our products, but no team from India is coming to inspect the factory. We even wrote to the Indian authority multiple times but our requests have fallen on deaf ears.”As per the provision, once the Indian inspection team gives a green signal after factory inspection, goods can be exported to India.In 2020, the Indian government asked the BIS to prescribe mandatory standards for imported goods in line with international quality norms. The move aimed to prevent Chinese goods from entering India from any of its neighbours.After the suppression of Chinese apps, the Indian government imposed import restrictions on more than 370 Chinese products. Insiders say India does not want any products from Nepal that have Chinese components, including Nepal’s hydroelectricity, greatly worrying Nepal’s top exporters.The BIS deals with the marking and certifying of goods, incorporating quality standards and information on international norms to be followed while importing.The rules worry Adhikari, who owns the AG Health Industries Private Limited that produces sanitary pads and diapers in Bhairahawa. “India seems intent to halt imports from Nepal,” said Adhikari. According to the association, Nepal used to export three truckloads of sanitary pads and diapers daily. There are 29 sanitary pads and diaper factories in Nepal, both large and small, employing 6,000 workers.Sanitary pads and diaper factories used to operate 12 hours a day when the demand boomed, but due to the export obstacles, factories have reduced operating hours by 4 hours, said Adhikari.According to the Department of Customs, Nepal exported 201.99 million pieces of sanitary pads and diapers worth Rs719 million to India in the last fiscal year, ending mid-July.Likewise, a big consignment of Goldstar shoes failed to get export clearance after India refused to issue the BIS certificate, putting Nepal’s homegrown shoemaker on the brink.Exporters said there were rumours on Friday that India had extended the deadline to obtain a BIS certificate, and the Nepali exporters were allowed to export goods with their existing certificates.“But we have not received any formal notice from the Indian authority on the time extension of the BIS certificate,” said Baburam Adhikari, spokesperson for the Ministry of Industry, Commerce and Supplies. “If the BIS had made such a decision, we would have been informed.”“Neither the BIS India nor the domestic industries has confirmed or communicated with us on the issue.”After Nepali exports were halted over the BIS issue, the industry ministry has written multiple times to its Indian counterpart. Meetings were held, and the issue was forwarded even during Industry Minister Damodar Bhandari’s visit to India in August. “However, there is no progress,” said Adhikari. Adhikari said none of the Nepali exporters who applied for the BIS certificate have gotten it till now.“The BIS certificate issue has put the industries in Rupandehi in a big dilemma. They were opened to export goods to India,” said Thakur Kumar Shrestha, president of the Siddhartha Chamber of Commerce and Industry. It has negatively impacted both the industries and Nepal’s trade.Shrestha said factories are either running at half capacity or getting shut down, and workers are being laid off. Exports from the cement makers in Rupandehi—such as Arghakhanchi Cement, Sarbottam Cement, Palpa Cement, and Balaji Cement—have completely stopped for nearly two months.“Even as the domestic consumption of cement declined, production was not impacted due to the huge demand from India. But now cement plants in Rupandehi are on the verge of shutting down or running under-capacity,” said Shrestha.Except plywood, the export of all the listed goods that require a BIS certificate has come to a halt, said Shrestha. “India has neither renewed the certificate nor provided a new one.”Goods under the BIS with compulsory certification are any variety of cement manufactured or sold in India, steel and iron products, chemicals, fertiliser, polymers and textiles, cables, flat transparent sheet glass, cattle feed, footwear, centrifugally cast (spun) iron pipes, jute bags, viscose staple fibres, geo textiles, portable water bottles, plywood, and wooden flush door shutters, among others.“Plywood is currently not restricted. But despite having already paid the BIS charges and completed the process, the inspection team from India has not provided a BIS certificate for Nepali goods,” said Hom Prasad Ghimire, president of the Nepal Plywood Manufacturers Association. Ghimire said that his company completed the process of getting the BIS certificate in June. He said the Nepali plywood is of better quality than the Indian plywood.Plywood has been given until March 2025 for certification-free export. He said that out of 80 plywood factories, 52 have even deposited charges to obtain the certificate. The plywood industry employs 25,000 workers across the country.According to the association, Nepal exported Rs8 billion worth of plywood to India. The volume could have increased had the exports not been interrupted.Trade with India has been repeatedly obstructed. Experts say there is a need to seek long-term solutions for uninterrupted trade with the southern neighbour. “There must be a mutual recognition agreement on select exportable items. Under such an agreement, exportable goods certified by the government will be recognised by the Indian government. This would be the best long-term solution for standard certification,” said Posh Raj Pandey, chairman of the South Asia Watch of Economics, Environment and Trade.Under the 2009 bilateral trade agreement with Nepal, India agreed to support the setting up of standard-purpose labs, said Pandey. However, Nepal has not been able to push for the labs during talks with India— even after 15 years of the agreement. He said lack of coordination among government agencies and frequent changes of bureaucrats have put the issue on the back burner. \nThe US has just concluded our generation's most eagerly watched presidential elections. Donald J Trump has won the White House resoundingly, and in addition, the Republican Party, also known as the Grand Old Party, has now wrested control of the Senate and has a comfortable majority in Congress. Simply put, Trump and the GOP now have complete control of the executive and legislative branches of the government, which will embolden the new Trump administration to pursue policies with determination. The world is closely watching how the Trump administration will usher in a new foreign policy paradigm that revolves around Trump’s “America First” philosophy. Foreign policy mandarins across the globe have mixed feelings about Trump's victory: Allies in Europe are gripped with anxiety, whereas in South Asia, there is a sense that since the rhetoric of Trump’s election campaign focused on combating China, Asia is on the cusp of witnessing unprecedented American engagement. It is in this context of American outreach in Asia that South Asia will play a pivotal role in shaping outcomes of a constantly evolving new world order. Nepal must remain steadfast in keeping up with developments of the great power games whilst constantly safeguarding and pursuing its interests independently. The heart of the US’s contention with China revolves around two critical issues: Trade and technology. The Covid-19 pandemic demonstrated to the world how global trade supply chains depended on supply lines in China. With the resurgence of the America First policy, the Trump administration is determined to impose new trade tariffs of up to 60 percent on Chinese exports. While the supposed new tariffs are likely to come into play in the second half of 2025, there is palpable fear that new trade tariffs could bring in disruptions to global trade as costs are likely to increase in the coming days. The Trump administration is determined to create new jobs to revitalise the economy by incentivising manufacturing in the country. Whilst Trump's plan to re-establish the US as a manufacturing hub is seen as a patriotic move, could higher labour costs in a developed country contribute towards lower production costs? The US’s trade conflict with China presents other developing nations in Asia with a unique opportunity to attract investments in the manufacturing industry. Although it is outlandish to suggest China will be entirely substituted as a manufacturing hub, the emergence of new manufacturing opportunities in the global south presents the US with the opportunity to fuel economic growth essential for the sustenance of democracy. South Asia gives the US a unique avenue for enhanced collaboration. With a democratic polity spread across most of South Asia’s landmass, job creation and energy production are the key elements for stability in the region. The Indo-Gangetic delta is among the most populous regions in the world and possesses the human capital to fuel economic growth across South Asia. Although the Civilian Nuclear Deal between India and the US is a milestone agreement for the use of clean nuclear energy to generate electricity in India, the nuclear plants in India only contribute 3.11 percent of the total electricity generated in India. For India to meet the energy requirements to set up a large-scale industrial base, access to high-quality uninterrupted energy will be critical for industrialisation in India and across South Asia. The Millennium Challenge Corporation pact signed between Nepal and the US is a significant breakthrough in Nepal’s energy sector, as American investment in upgrading transmission line infrastructure is greatly required to transport high-quality, uninterrupted energy.Nepal still requires robust investment in the transmission side to feed supply lines across South Asia. The fact that Nepal, Bangladesh and India have signed a power trade agreement demonstrates the potential of Nepal’s energy sector in fuelling energy to propel economic growth in the region. South Asia missed the industrial flight back in the decades of the 80s and the 90s; it’s time the region reaped the benefits of the US capital that could trigger a wave of industrialisation. Another focal point of tension between the US and China is the issue of semiconductors. The US would want to retain the technological leadership of high-end chips in the hands of its allies, namely Taiwan, South Korea and the Netherlands. Currently, the world relies solely on Taiwan and its crown jewel, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (TSMC), for high-end chips—TSMC has a market share of 90 percent of advanced chip manufacturing. Both the US and China know the strategic advantage one can gain by accessing high-end chips, which is critical for next-generation AI modelling in sectors such as defence, intelligence, telecom, medicine and aerospace. The ability to store big data also depends on the quality and the advanced functioning of high-end chips. In simple words, the US’s ability to retain control and contain access to high-end chips to compete whilst diversifying the production of low-end chips will provide the US and its allies the political leverage it desperately wants. The tech industry in South Asia has been recognised as a force to reckon with, particularly in India and the periphery of Bangladesh. Sri Lanka seems to have made progress, while Nepal also aspires to expand its tech business reach. Cross-border payments, the expansion of data centres and the use of technology in the delivery of governance are areas of expansive collaboration. India’s ability to produce low-end chips in the future is also critical to expanding the tech industry in South Asia, as indigenously produced chips can help reduce manufacturing costs and the tech industry’s dependency on accessing chips elsewhere, which are always in high demand globally. But there are also areas of concern for South Asia regarding Trump’s ascendency to the White House. Trump has vowed to pull out of the Paris Climate Agreement and climate change is an issue that confronts South Asia, particularly Nepal. Nepal has witnessed firsthand the impacts of climate change and, therefore, the country and South Asia at large cannot afford to ignore the impact of climate change. This issue cannot become secondary for either Nepal or the region. Climate change challenges the livelihoods of our people, and the Government of Nepal must voice its concern visibly and work towards creating strategic alliances that will compel the new US administration to rethink walking away from Paris Climate Agreement. The new US administration and its South Asian partners must work on issues impacting human welfare to achieve wider social and economic participation in the democratic process in the region. Trump’s vision of America First is virtuous, but to restore the US’s trust globally, he must take its allies into confidence.  \nHow big will the impact be as Nepal’s major international airport closes for ten hours starting Friday?Economists say it’s too early to quantify, but the losses for the Nepali economy will be huge.Nepal’s economic momentum has slowed down since the late September floods, and the government’s decision to close the key airport could stifle growth.“It will be a big setback for the country’s ailing economy as it will hit tourism and business activities, including transport, hotels, restaurants, telecommunication and other sectors,” said Bishwambhar Pyakurel, a noted economist. Pyakurel called it a deliberate “restriction” imposed by the government, despite it having many alternatives to carry out construction at the airport.Tickets prices are soaring, with most destinations, including Nepal’s labour markets, witnessing a fourfold price rise due to a widening gap between supply and demand.A notice to airmen, popularly known as NOTAM, issued by the Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal, states that the airport will be closed from 10pm to 8am from Friday for five months, until March 31, to expand the taxiways. The airport is currently closed from 2am to 6am. Two parallel taxiway projects are ongoing at the Tribhuvan International Airport in Kathmandu. The extension of the parallel taxiway was initially planned in 2009.Travel trade entrepreneurs said the civil aviation body’s mismanagement could shave off at least Rs50 billion in airline and tourism industry revenues, even as the government struggles with revenue generation.The outlooks for 2024-2025 of the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank, and the International Monetary Fund forecast economic recovery on the basis of improved tourist arrivals in Nepal. Growth in food, transport, and accommodation sectors have been better than expected even as other economic indicators lag.In September, the Asian Development Bank revised Nepal’s economic growth forecast upward to 4.9 percent for the current fiscal year beginning mid-July, based on projected agricultural and electricity output growth and buoyant tourist arrivals.The National Statistics Office’s annual account estimated that accommodation and food service activities, which are linked to tourism, would see a robust growth of 21.84 percent, the highest among 18 economic compositions in the Nepali economy, in the last fiscal year ended mid-July.According to the respective ministries, the late monsoon floods and landslides affected agriculture and electricity output, and now tourism has received a big jolt.It will be more painful for domestic airlines as winter will bring more fog and pollution, curtailing flight frequencies.“It’s an unplanned construction,” said Pyakurel. “Today, time is money. For trading, business and leisure, coming to Nepal will be a big challenge,” he said, adding that the airfares are so high that tourists and businessmen will think twice before flying. Hoteliers say that due to high ticket prices, key events planned in Kathmandu have either been postponed or cancelled.As part of the improvement plan, a 1,140-metre-long parallel taxiway is being built on the runway’s southern side, or the Koteshwar end. This will connect the existing international apron to the end of runway 02.Similarly, another 450-metre-long parallel taxiway is being built at the northern end of the runway.Considering the planned infrastructure, the maximum runway capacity will see 42 aircraft movements per hour in mixed-mode operation, enabling 187,000 aircraft movements per year from the 128,449 flight movements last year. In 2023, the Kathmandu airport recorded 8.7 million passengers—4.54 million international air travellers and 4.15 million domestic ones, according to statistics of the Tribhuvan International Airport.Similarly, in terms of flight movement, the airport handled 128,449 flight movements—31,460 flights by international airlines and 96,989 by domestic carriers.Travel trade entrepreneurs say the ill-planned construction would take way too long, extending until another peak tourism season in spring (March).“These will be painful months for travel trade entrepreneurs as the plan is being implemented in the peak tourism season. We, however, cannot oppose the airport’s infrastructure development,” said Sagar Pandey, president of the Trekking Agencies Association of Nepal.“On different occasions, we have suggested that the government and the civil aviation body find alternatives to such a long closure, such as incentivising airlines to fly from Bhairahawa and Pokhara international airports.”However, international airlines are hesitant to connect to the new airports, which have remained idle for months due to the technical and financial issues of flying to them.Pandey said they might lose at least 40 percent of trekkers this year considering the flight cancellations.Nepal Tourism Board has revised its 2024 tourist arrival forecast to 1.1 million from the projected 1.3 million. As of October, Nepal has received 900,000 tourists.Some entrepreneurs say that five hours of construction time, as it used to be, was appropriate, but insiders suspect that a 10-hour closure would force many airlines to divert to Bhairahawa. For instance, on October 27, the Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal (CAAN) took action against a Thai AirAsia flight, refusing to allow it to land at Kathmandu airport.Media reports show that the flight was later permitted. However, after the plane landed, authorities temporarily suspended the airline and its general sales agent. Later the restrictions were lifted on the “condition” that the airline would fly from Bhairahawa as well. Airline officials say the “punitive measure” was not the aviation regulator’s first action. On October 30, 2022, the CAAN cancelled Nepal Airlines’ scheduled flight to Delhi as punishment for defying instructions to move some of its international services to the newly-built Bhairahawa airport.Nepal Airlines’ jet remained on the ground, and more than 500 passengers were affected by the last-minute cancellation.“I would like to seriously draw the attention of the government that Tribhuvan International Airport is being closed for 10 hours daily from November 8 to March 31. It cannot be considered normal to close an international airport for 10 hours to build structures. Earlier, during the rehabilitation of the main runway, the airport was closed only for 5/7 hours at night,” lawmaker Udaya Shumsher Rana wrote on X on October 29.“It is clear that closing the Kathmandu airport means diverting flights to Pokhara and Bhairahawa to show that those two airports are fine. There are technical reasons behind international airlines not being ready to fly to these two airports. Undoubtedly, the Civil Aviation Authority leadership is trying to hide its weaknesses by closing the Kathmandu airport for 10 hours.”Rana argued that if this decision is not revised, Nepal’s global image and tourism business would suffer. The airport closure will also hit domestic flights. Buddha Air, Nepal’s largest domestic carrier, currently operates 180 daily flights. As the airline must reduce its flights to 135, there will be a substantial drop in its revenue and government’s taxes. Some other domestic airlines have complained to the regulator that flight allocation is not proportionate under the new arrangement. \n\n\nRae was the envoy to Kathmandu during the promulgation of the 2015 constitution and the subsequent blockade. In this conversation, Rae talks about the evolution of Nepal-India ties since the blockade, regional geopolitics, what the two countries get wrong about each other, how New Delhi views Nepali communist parties and the governments they lead, and the change (if any) in India’s neighbourhood policy since the start of Narendra Modi’s third term in office. \nKunwar has been the MD for just under three years. Before coming back to her homeland to join Daraz Nepal, she worked at different American companies, including Amazon, the world’s biggest e-commerce platform. In this conversation, Kunwar talks about the opportunities and challenges of running an e-commerce enterprise in Nepal, as well as the country’s overall business environment.  \nResident doctors working in private medical colleges in Nepal have threatened to abandon their duties and protest in the street if their demand for a monthly minimum allowance of Rs48,000, equivalent to the government-employed doctors, is not met.In a joint statement released on Tuesday, six associations representing resident doctors emphasised the need for parity in allowances between private and government sectors. They called on private medical colleges to allocate seats for MD/MS courses only after ensuring that monthly living allowances equivalent to an officer (eighth level in administrative hierarchy) are provided.This demand follows a prior decision by the Medical Education Commission, which had initially mandated private colleges to provide the stipulated allowances before seat allocation. However, under directives from Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli, the commission reversed its decision and proceeded with seat allocation, sparking widespread dissatisfaction among healthcare professionals.Leaders from various organisations, including Dr Sheshraj Ghimire of the Safe Workplace Struggle Committee for Health Workers and Dr Uttam Chaulagai, president of the National Association of Resident Doctors, have expressed their discontent with the government’s move. Other signatories of the statement included representatives from Tribhuvan University Teaching Hospital, Patan Academy of Health Sciences, and Pokhara Academy of Health Sciences, among others.The resident doctors have urged the government to prioritise implementing the agreement reached on September 30, 2023, which promised uniformity in allowances for resident and intern doctors across private and public sectors. Currently, private medical colleges provide allowances ranging from Rs19,000 to Rs24,000—far below the agreed standard.The doctors have accused private institutions of exploiting them by withholding fair allowances. They stated unequivocally that they would be compelled to halt work and launch protests if the government proceeded without addressing their concerns.“We cannot accept the allocation of seats without a guarantee of Rs48,000 monthly allowances,” the statement read. “If our plea is ignored, we will have no choice but to quit our jobs and take to the streets.”The controversy deepened after Sunday’s meeting at the prime minister’s residence in Baluwatar, where the Medical Education Commission decided to allow private colleges to claim MD/MS seats without ensuring the prescribed allowances. The decision has drawn sharp criticism from resident doctors, who described it as a step backwards in safeguarding their rights and welfare. \nThe conflict between the Kathmandu Metropolitan City Mayor Balendra Shah and leadership of the ruling party, the CPN-UML, seems to be deepening as the two sides show no sign of rapprochement.In the latest episode, the KMC has fined the ruling UML Rs100,000 for littering the streets of the capital city Kathmandu while holding a mass meet on Friday. Within hours of the conclusion of the UML’s ‘Awakening rally against anarchy’ at Durbarmarg in downtown Kathmandu, the KMC made public a decision saying that the city office had fined the ruling party.But the UML leadership took serious exception to the mayor’s action. “It can be understood that Kathmandu Metropolis Mayor Balen [Balendra] has been used [by someone] against the CPN-UML, which has become clearer after the issuance of today’s ‘pamphlet’,” UML General Secretary Shankar Pokhrel wrote on Facebook a few hours after the issuance of the city office’s fine notice. He claimed that members of the rally organising committee were busy cleaning the area on their own when the metropolitan officials issued the notice.KMC representatives reached the UML party office in Chyasal on Sunday to hand over the receipt of the fine issued on Friday. After the party refused to receive it, the notice of fine was sent to the party office by email today (Monday), said Nabin Manandhar, KMC spokesperson. UML’s office secretary, Bhisma Adhikari, denied the allegations that the party littered the street during the rally. If there had been rubbish, our cadres would have cleaned it up. Adhikari said, “But the KMC issued a notice against us to defame our party, which is a politically motivated action.” Adhikari also stated that his party wouldn’t pay the fine and that the party office had not received any mail from the KMC. The City’s assistant spokesperson, Dhurba Kumar Kafle, differs. Kafle says a team from the environment department and the metropolitan police were present at the demonstration venue. It was only after inspecting the ground that the KMC slapped a fine, he said.Political observers say the KMC has been selective in imposing the fine. They, however, criticised the party for disrupting the traffic on Friday, badly affecting people’s daily lives.“Picking a party to impose a fine but turning a blind eye to similar activities carried out by other parties shows the City’s bias,” Keshav Dahal, a political analyst, said. “To prove they are not biased, the KMC from now on should penalise other political forces and groups as well for carrying out similar activities.” For the past few months, the streets of Kathmandu have witnessed many protests by various political parties. Before the UML, the main opposition party, CPN (Maoist Centre), organised a protest rally on October 26 in Kathmandu. Until recently, the Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP) was in the street, holding multiple street protests in Kathmandu, claiming the arrest of their party chief Rabi Lamichhane was politically motivated. The City spokesperson Manandhar denied the allegation of being biased. “When the other parties had organised protests, the KMC did not see the necessity of issuing a fine as there was less garbage,” Manandhar said. “But the UML’s gathering compelled us to issue a notice of fine.” Jhalak Subedi, a political analyst, however thinks both the UML and the KMC are engaging in stunts.“The City issued a fine against UML and the UML put up a vehement denial after being imposed a fine. Both were doing stunts,” Subedi said. But it would have been more mature of the UML to respond to the KMC as per existing laws, he added.“If there is a lack of a policy in this connection, the UML could have vowed to bring the policy so that such incidents can be better handled in the future,” Subedi said.On April 9, the KMC had fined the Rastriya Prajantra Party (RPP) Rs5,000 for littering the streets of Kathmandu while staging a protest. Recalling the episode, Nilkantha Kafle, the treasurer of the RPP, said that the party had paid the fine.“We realised that we could have made a mistake by not cleaning up the streets after demonstrations. So we paid the fine,” Kafle said. Political analyst Subedi reckons the latest incident could be the result of bitter relations between UML chair KP Sharma Oli and KMC mayor Balendra Shah.Of late, Prime Minister Oli and other leaders from his party have been engaged in one after another dispute with Mayor Shah. On June 3, Shah accused Oli of engaging in ‘policy corruption’ by being involved in illegal land swap of Giri Bandhu Tea Estate in Jhapa. After that, then deputy prime minister and minister for Physical Infrastructure and Transport Raghubir Mahaseth tried to halt the mayor’s plan to widen pavements in the Capital’s New Road area. Mayor Shah even sent metropolitan workers to dump a truckload of dirt in front of the office of the road department, which is under Mahaseth’s ministry.In September, Mayor Shah criticised Prime Minister Oli for failing to take action against UML provincial assembly member Rekha Sharma, who was accused of abusing a child domestic worker for eight years.“The court has also decided to prosecute the accused,” Shah wrote on Facebook. “Respected prime minister, good governance entails taking action against your lawmaker accused of domestic violence.”“Perhaps to you, good governance is limited to announcing a compensation of Rs100,000 and shedding crocodile tears on Facebook over her death,” Mayor Shah wrote on the social media post. Previously, the UML and Mayor Shah had argued for and against implementing the Supreme Court ruling that ordered vacating the Bagmati riverside land.  \nPrime Minister and CPN-UML chair KP Sharma Oli can stoop any low when it comes to criticising his opponents. Making below-the-belt remarks, blending them with ukhan tukka (proverbs and quips), is his signature style of public speeches, which are often lengthy.However, Oli’s address at the party’s mass gathering on Friday didn’t follow his common style. Yet he spent a significant chunk of his around 45-minute speech on criticising some individuals and political parties, but not in his fiery manner.Party’s general secretary Shankar Pokhrel had set a tone for the gathering, which was named “Awakening Rally against Anarchy” by the ruling party, clarifying the allegations levelled against his party and supremo Oli mainly by controversial businessman Durga Prasai.Prasai, disclosing unsubstantiated documents, claimed that Oli has invested $250 million in a Cambodian telecom company. Police have arrested him, accusing him of making serious allegations with the mala fide intention of defaming the prime minister. “Our chairperson has said he will provide the money to the person who can establish his investment there,” said Pokhrel, claiming a section is making one after another baseless allegations to defame Oli. He also tried to paint a nationalist picture of his party arguing it has never taken any decision against the national interest which is why conspiracies are hatched against the party to the extent of splitting it.Oli started his address by trying to justify why the current Nepali Congress-UML coalition was formed and assuring how it will remain intact until the next elections. He claimed that he will remain as prime minister until June 2026 and hand over the premiership to Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba until the next general elections to be held at the end of 2027. “Let there be no confusion, this coalition is here to stay until the next elections,” he said. “I request you to dispel the rumours that this government will not last longer.”Oli remarked that he inherited the prime ministerial seat laden with huge state loans, a crisis-ridden national economy, high level of corruption and low-spirited industrialists. Like on every public platform, he reiterated that the ruling coalition was formed to uplift the country from its falling economy, establish good governance, control corruption, promote entrepreneurship and to put it on the path of prosperity.The UML in July broke its partnership with the CPN (Maoist Centre) to form a government led by Oli. Shattered, the Maoist Centre has been claiming that the two largest parties were worried by its crackdown against the corrupt and criminals. Therefore, leaders from the two parties formed the government to protect their cronies. Maoist leaders spare no opportunity to label the Oli government “corrupt”.Without naming any party or leader, Oli at the rally dared anyone to argue with the UML with evidence. “I will neither commit corruption, nor will allow anyone to do so,” he reiterated. “It is ironic that those who have amassed billions of rupees, enough for seven generations, are accusing the UML of corruption.” He devoted some minutes of his speech to lambasting Prasai who accused him of investment in Cambodia. “Anything can be claimed for the sake of claiming. There is 32,000 crores [Rs320 billion] in Cambodia, and as much in the Swiss Bank. You can go and check it. Why just that, half of the deposits in American banks are mine. There is no point making senseless statements,” he said, adding that in modern times checking who has invested in the Cambodian telecom sector is a simple job.Though he claimed nobody really buys such baseless claims and his party is unbothered about the acts of such a handful of anarchic people, his stress on clarifying Prasai’s claim clearly demonstrated his apprehension. His government has already arrested Prasai, which, according to Oli, is a move against the attempts of the anarchic forces to disrupt social harmony and cohesion.Rastriya Swatantra Party was another target of Oli. He reiterated that no corrupt individual will be spared and no innocent one will be framed. Criticising the act of holding rallies against the government to oppose the arrest of party president Rabi Lamichhane, Oli said it is shameful to denounce others when “you yourself indulge in fraud”. “There is enough evidence of fraud in the cooperatives against you. You are deceiving hundreds of people, yet scolding others,\" said Oli.Oli used the mass gathering to vent his ire at Nepal Electricity Authority Managing Director Kulman Ghising, claiming that the latter's moves were targeted at discouraging the industrialists. On a different note, the prime minister defended his decision to visit China before India, calling critics “absurd” and “cowardly” for questioning his diplomatic priorities.“Where is it written that one must visit a particular country first? Is it in religious texts, the Constitution, or the UN Charter?” Oli asked, while addressing a mass meeting organised by the UML in Kathmandu.His remarks are directed at former prime minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal, who suggested in an interview with Indian newspaper The Hindu that Oli was playing the “China card” by prioritising a visit to China over India. Oli’s UML, in a statement earlier, condemned Dahal’s statement.Oli reiterated Nepal’s commitment to maintaining balanced relations with all neighbours. “We will foster ties with all our neighbours based on mutual respect and equality while safeguarding our sovereignty and national interests,” he said. “We harbour no enmity towards anyone; we have no enemies.”The prime minister also expressed his confidence in the success of his upcoming visit to the north. “This is not a casual trip. I will personally report its success upon my return,” Oli said.The UML might have named the gathering an awakening rally, but neither Oli nor his party leaders made any new remarks on Friday. Though the second largest party had claimed to parade 100,000 supporters, the number was not even a fourth of the planned strength. However, it was enough to obstruct the traffic in most parts of the Capital. People suffered hugely as vehicular movement was disturbed throughout the day due to the rallies and the gathering. \nA series of events unfolding at least for the past eight months has pushed the Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP) into a difficult situation, leaving the leaders of the two-year-old party confused.The RSP leaders look more perplexed following the arrest of party president Rabi Lamichhane on the allegations of involvement in embezzling tens of millions of rupees from various cooperatives.Police arrested Lamichhane, who is also a former deputy prime minister and home minister, from the party’s central office in Kathmandu on October 18 following an arrest warrant from the Kaski District Court.After that district courts in Rupandehi, Kathmandu and Chitwan also issued arrest warrants against Lamichhane and others on charges of embezzling funds from the cooperatives. Lamichhane, among other individuals, is accused of embezzling deposits from Kathmandu-based Swarnalaxmi Cooperative, Pokhara-based Suryadarshan Cooperative, Butwal-based Supreme Cooperative and Bharatpur-based Sahara Chitwan Cooperative.RSP announced protest programmes in Pokhara and Kathmandu on October 19, a day after Lamichhane's arrest, claiming that the party chief’s arrest was politically motivated.The party also staged demonstrations in Bhairahawa when Lamichhane was taken in custody for interrogation for his involvement in misappropriating funds from the Supreme Cooperative based in Butwal. However, the RSP, which has announced the second phase of its protest for November 23, has decided to change its strategy.The party’s central committee meeting on Tuesday witnessed division among the central committee members over the modality of protest. Then the meeting on November 20 eventually decided to change the format for the second-phase protest. “Few leaders at the central committee meeting argued that the second phase of protest should not be different from the first one,” a central committee member of the party told the Post on the condition of anonymity. “But, in view of the protest’s little public appeal, the party decided to change its form in the second phase.”However, central committee member Hari Dhakal, who is also a lawmaker, refuted the claim. Dhakal argued that the party decided to change the protest format considering the by-election scheduled for December 1, in which the RSP has fielded its candidacy in 27 out of 44 seats up for grabs.“This time, we plan to make the people aware of our agenda through the election campaign. Therefore, all the protests ahead are not street-centric,” Dhakal told the Post.According to the party leaders privy to the developments, despite Dhakal's claim, some who spoke at the November 19 central committee meeting argued that the public was not interested in the agenda they pursued following Lamichhane’s arrest.Dhakal agreed that the RSP often seemed confused while making a political decision after the party chair’s arrest. Lamichhane has so far not given any definite role to other leaders to oversee the party affairs in his absence. “Naturally, a new party like ours will have a certain kind of dilemma in the absence of the main leader,” Dhakal added. “However, this does not mean that the political activities of our party have come to a standstill.”In a country like Nepal, it is natural that parties are often individual-centric, and the RSP is not different, says a political analyst. “In a leader-centric party, it is natural that the absence of central leadership often puts the party in a tight spot while taking major political decisions,” Chiranjibi Bhandari, a political analyst who is also an assistant professor at the central department of Conflict, Peace and Development Studies, told the Post. Following its impressive performance in the 2022 general elections and the 2023 by-elections, many observers extrapolated a mighty electoral success for the RSP in the following years. In their reckoning, the party was expected to challenge the Nepali Congress and the UML, the two oldest and biggest players of Nepali politics, in the national elections due in 2027.However, everything was not well with the party. When the RSP candidate fared badly in the Ilam-2 by-election held in April, the party’s leaders drew up a conclusion that something had gone wrong with the party organisation. Then, the RSP entrusted then-party general secretary Mukul Dhakal with touring various parts of the country and studying the matter. Dhakal, the party's founding general secretary, visited 38 districts and submitted a review report to the party committee. As Dhakal also leaked the report to the media it caused a storm within the party as his finding chiefly blamed chair Lamichhane for the party’s diminishing image in the public.The report resulted in Dhakal's expulsion from the party.The problem deepened when the parliamentary special committee formed to investigate the crisis-ridden cooperatives implicated the party’s chair in a case of cooperatives funds misuse. While the party rank and file vehemently denied the claim, Lamichhane’s arrest came as a big blow to the RSP.Some current indications are certainly not encouraging for RSP leaders. The party reportedly found no candidate for the Kirtipur mayoral election scheduled for December 1.The Ilam and Kirtipur episodes suggest that the RSP has failed to expand its command down to the grassroots, experts say.Senior vice-president of RSP, DP Aryal acknowledged that his party failed to find an appropriate candidate in Kirtipur Municipality, which could be normal for any other party. “We were looking for a candidate who could carry the values and principles of our party,” Aryal told the Post. “After not finding an appropriate candidate in Kirtipur Municipality, we took a decision to not field anyone who could not champion the principles and values of our party.” The RSP sent a chilling message to the major traditional forces when it emerged the fourth largest party in the November 2022 election, just six months after its establishment. In the 2023 by-elections, it gained one more seat.However, within two years, the party was in a position to change its protest format, claiming it was failing to attract public support. Does this signal the party is in serious trouble?“New political parties like the RSP got traction due to the public disenchantment towards the traditional political parties, not because of their own political agenda,” said Bhandari. “The party has yet to prove itself in the public eye.” Political analyst Bhandari further added that they might have switched the protest format after the earlier one did not work. “It, however, would be too early to call it a downfall of the party,” he added.“The party is indeed in a dilemma after Lamichhane’s arrest. However, shifting the protest strategy cannot be termed otherwise,” Bhandari said. \nCandidates for mayor in Kirtipur Municipality, where a by-election is being held on December 1, have started their election campaign. In the race are a total of 20 candidates—nine from various political parties and 11 independents.In the 2022 local elections, independent candidates presented a formidable challenge to political party candidates in various local units. Independent candidates won mayorships in the Kathmandu Metropolitan City, the Dharan Sub-Metropolitan City and the Dhangadhi Municipality. Will the outcome in Kirtipur be different this time, or will the traditional parties prevail? The by-election comes after the death of Rajkumar Nakarmi, former Mayor of Kirtipur Municipality, who died in July due to kidney failure. He had won on a Nepali Congress ticket.Major political parties including the Congress, the CPN-UML and the CPN (Maoist Centre) have fielded their candidates. But the fourth largest political party in the House of Representatives, the Rastriya Swatantra Party, did not field anyone reportedly after failing to find a suitable candidate.The candidates include Krishnaman Dangol from the Congress, Surendra Manandhar from the UML, and Shiva Sharan Maharjan from the Maoist Centre. Besides these, seventeen others, including 11 independents, have filed their nominations. Candidates from other parties include Dil Kumar Maharjan of the Nepal Samajbawadi Party, Shri Krishna Maharjan of the Nepal Majdoor Kishan Party, Dhurba Maharjan of the Rastriya Prajatantra Party, and Keshav Shrestha of the Janamat Party. Similarly, independent candidates include Navaraj Kumar Baniya, Rajman Manav, Ram Krishna Maharjan, Mim Maharjan, Prem Bahadur Maharjan, Dinesh Kumar Adhikari, Naresh Shrestha, Dharmaratna Manandhar, Ananda Maharjan, Nareshraj Pande, and Kabir Kumar Maharjan. In the 2022 local elections, the Congress candidate Nakarmi won the mayorship with 9,043 votes, while his closest competitor, Keshav Ratna Bajracharya of the UML, secured 5,507 votes. The Maoist Centre’s Shiva Saran Maharjan, who is contesting for the position in the by-election, had obtained 4,090 votes then. Of the total 31,112 registered voters, almost 14,000 live in the core area of Kirtipur, and the remaining 17,000 reside in the peripheral regions. The core area includes the municipality’s wards 1, 2, 3, 9, 10, including Tyanglaphat, whereas the peripheral areas include wards 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8. The core area is predominantly inhabited by the Newar community, while the peripheral region is more diverse with migrants in big numbers. Political leaders and analysts say that the peripheral region will be decisive in the election.But Congress candidate Krishnaman Dangol disputes this claiming that the concept of peripheral region is a misrepresentation. “The area that some people call ‘peripheral’ is in fact the core of Kirtipur,” Dangol told the Post. “From Nagau, Panga, Bhajungle, to Chobhar all are part of Kirtipur’s core area.”UML candidate Surendra Manandhar agrees with Dangol and says dividing the local unit along community lines is not a good idea.Dangol, the Congress candidate, considers UML’s Manandhar his close competitor, but some local residents say the true challenge could come from the Maoist Centre’s Shiva Sharan Maharjan, who had a strong showing in the 2022 local election. “Majarjan already contested and did well. The UML’s Manandhar is new, therefore we believe there will be a tough competition between the Congress and the Maoist Centre,” said a local resident.The Maoist Centre has also forged an electoral alliance with the CPN (Unified Socialist) and the Janata Samajbadi-Nepal, led by Upendra Yadav, to strengthen its bid.“I lost the previous election due to a technical mistake, but this time, we are confident of a win,” the Maoist Centre candidate Maharjan told the Post. He said his chances have improved due to the growing public disenchantment towards the current ruling Congress-UML coalition.But UML’s Manandhar appears unbothered by the competition. He said he is better prepared than others and is confident of a win.For the Congress, the contest appears more difficult as former Congress party members are running as independents. Kabir Kumar Maharjan and Dinesh Kumar Adhikari, who were previously with the Congress, are among the independent candidates.“The situation of Congress is different. For other parties, winning adds a seat, but losing doesn’t make much difference because they hadn’t won this seat in the previous election,” Himal Karki, a local Congress leader, told the Post. “But, for Congress, there’s a pressure to win because this is a seat our party earlier won.”An overwhelming presence of independent candidates makes the contest more complex for Congress, as local figures who have established their own identity in Kirtipur, such as Rajman Manav, are getting considerable voter attention.Harka Sampang, the independent mayor of Dharan Sub-metropolitan City, has also expressed his support for Manav. Sampang is set to join Manav’s election campaign starting from November 23.“Harka Sampang will be in Kirtipur for my election campaign,” Manav told the Post.Congress candidate Dangol, meanwhile, does not consider Manav as a competitor. He claimed that Manav is a former UML cadre and quit the party to focus on social activities, especially sanitation campaigns. “So Manav could draw UML votes, not ours,” Dangol said.Meanwhile, Suresh Maharjan, a Kirtipur resident who identifies himself as a Maoist Centre sympathiser, says the votes garnered by independent candidates will determine the election’s outcome.  \nDharahara, which reopened to the public on Constitution Day this year, has started charging entry fees from Sunday. Over 90,000 people have climbed the new iconic tower for free since it opened on September 19, but visitors will now need to pay Rs200 per person. Students, senior citizens, and persons with disabilities will be given a 50 percent discount.The Ministry of Urban Development said a fee for visitors from SAARC countries is Rs500 per person, while those from non-SAARC countries will have to pay Rs1,000 each. Entry into the Dharahara premises will cost Rs50. Fees for commercial activities are higher. For instance, it has been set at Rs5,000 per hour for videography, Rs1,000 per hour for photography, and Rs5,000 per hour for non-commercial advertisements on the Dharahara tower. Prakash Aryal, director of the Central Project Implementation Unit (Building and Housing) under the ministry, said that visitors may sometimes face delays as the new system is in the initial stage of implementation. “The time required to manage operations after implementing the fee system might cause delays for those climbing Dharahara,” Aryal said. Visitors can access the tower between 10am and 4pm, but operating hours may be adjusted later. The historic tower will remain closed every Wednesday.The International Convention Centre in New Baneshwar will look after the management until a dedicated committee is formed.The government has declared Dharahara and five other structures, including Jhapa’s Damak View Tower, as ‘special structures’. The Urban Development Ministry has issued an order to facilitate their operation under a public-private partnership model, proposing to lease their management to private entities through competitive bidding. “Minimal fees have been introduced to cover operational expenses such as utilities, staff salaries, and maintenance,” said Mani Ram Gelal, secretary at the ministry. “The state does not intend to make a profit, only to recover costs.” He said it would take at least four months for a private operator to take over once the process is completed. “We cannot provide free access indefinitely, as there are expenses for water, electricity, and staff. While not seeking profit, the fees will help cover operational costs,” said Gelal. Aryal said that by adjusting the schedule and deploying more staff, up to 3,000 visitors could be accommodated daily. “Daily crowds were overwhelming during the free entry period,” he said. “Now we’ll see how the visitor numbers change after introducing fees.” The rebuilt tower, equipped with two lifts, still faces occasional technical problems. Leaks during Tihar, caused by an improperly closed door at the top of the tower, temporarily affected the lifts, but the issue has since been resolved. Online ticketing is expected to be introduced within a month. “Until then, visitors will need to buy tickets at the site,” Aryal said. The Dharahara reconstruction is nearly complete, but some electrical work remains pending. Aryal assured us that the pending work would not affect visitors climbing the tower.The iconic structure, which is historically taken as a major landmark of the capital city Kathmandu, was destroyed by 2015 earthquake. The tower, located at the heart of the City, was rebuilt and reopened to the public nine years after the natural disaster. \n\nWomen and young girls, once excluded from the tradition of playing Newari musical instruments, are now taking the lead in preserving and revitalising the centuries-old Newari musical tradition.One such example of change is the Lubhoo Dhaa Khala, which, according to its members, is the oldest Dhaa group in Lubhu of Lalitpur district. This group performs especially during jatras and other major Newari festivals.The group now boasts a new batch of around 40 musicians, 20 of whom are women and girls. These individuals are mastering the percussive Dhaa and Khin, and the cymbals Tah and Bhusya, instruments historically reserved for men.The group’s performances have now become a central part of local festivities, especially during the Gunla festival—a month-long celebration marking spiritual reflection and cultural devotion.The musical instrument Dhaa is central to the festival’s observance. Known as the Gunla baja, the Dhaa is revered as the Buddha’s favourite instrument and is believed to bring good luck and prosperity when played around chaityas and temples.“In the past, Newari instruments like the Dhaa were associated with male musicians, creating an exclusionary tradition,” says Bekh Narayan Shrestha, the head teacher of Lubhoo Dhaa Khala.However, as social attitudes evolve, so do the practices surrounding these cultural symbols. Women are now claiming their rightful place in this heritage, learning and performing with great panache.Bekh Narayan also says that while in the past playing this instrument was reserved for the higher Shrestha caste, today, caste is no longer a barrier—anyone can be a disciple.Concerned about the traditional instruments nearing extinction, Bekh Narayan took the initiative in 2000 to establish a group and personally began teaching students.While the Lubhoo Dhaa Khala began as a male-dominated group, its evolution into an inclusive space for women is an example of progress. Mandevi Shrestha, 38, who is Bekh Narayan’s daughter, is one beneficiary of the group’s outreach.“I was always a rebel,” Mandevi says. “I put pressure on my father, who was the group’s teacher, to teach us girls as well. I told him, ‘If boys in my own home can learn to play it, why can’t I?”Mandevi adds, “My persistence paid off, and in 2014, five women learners were included in the boys group.”When some women who had joined in 2014 migrated after marriage, the number of women in the group dwindled. At the time, conservative societal attitudes discouraged many women from learning alongside men. Moreover, the women were often not given priority. This led to a temporary halt in teaching women.However, over time, as more women expressed interest and the teachers faced pressure from within their own families—with their daughters and female relatives also wanting to play—by 2017 the group formally began recruiting all-female batches.“When we first started, there was evident discrimination,” says Ashmita Pradhan, 23, who started learning the instrument in 2014 and has been teaching all-female batches since 2017. “Women were not seen as equals then. I’m glad to see things have improved. Nowadays, young girls join the group with full family support.”The change is most evident in the current generation of musicians.Prayusha Shrestha, an 11-year-old student at Future Star Academy in Lubhu, began learning Dhaa in 2023. “After school, I would rush to finish my homework and run to the training sessions,” she says. “I was always excited to learn.”Another student, 20-year-old Sarishma Shrestha, adds, “From childhood, I listened to these instruments. But at the time, participation of girls wasn’t encouraged. When I finally got the chance last year, I was elated.”The inclusion of women in Lubhoo Dhaa Khala has inspired a new generation of learners, some of whom are under 10 years old. While others like Samira Shrestha (25), Neshana Shrestha (24), and Kriti Shrestha (23), have been playing since 2017. This trio belongs to the second batch of female learners, trained by Pradhan herself.According to Samira, in the past, when they played during jatras, there were very few women involved. Despite the judgmental stares, they played with confidence.“Today, the number of girls has increased significantly, and it’s great to see women and girls reclaim their space in preserving our culture, heritage, and music,” Samira says.However, there are still hurdles.According to Mandevi, some instruments, like the Khin, are still predominantly taught to men. “We’re advocating for change,” she says, “so that these traditions become fully inclusive.”For teacher Bekh Narayan, preserving Newari music goes beyond gender inclusivity.He emphasises the need for financial support to sustain the tradition. “Instruments are becoming more expensive,” he says. “We’ve introduced a donation box so even students can contribute, even if it’s just one rupee. We need support from the local government too.”Currently, in the Khala, only the girls from Lubhu are part of the group. So they are now planning to include married daughters-in-law as well.“This will help preserve our culture while empowering homemakers with Newari musicianship, ensuring the culture is passed down generations,” Bekh Narayan says.The members of Lubhoo Dhaa Khala believe their efforts go beyond cultural preservation.Sarishma notes that traditional instruments like the Dhaa enrich Nepal’s musical heritage. “They add diversity to the nation’s music scene, which is often overshadowed by modern and western influences,” she says.In Lubhu, the beats of the Dhaa are no longer produced by just one gender or generation.“Ten years ago, when there were few women, our dedication was often questioned,” Pradhan says. “Now, with more young girls joining, we feel empowered.” \nOne person was killed and five others injured in a tractor accident in Bhaktapur on Saturday.The incident occurred when the tractor lost control and overturned while travelling to Dekochha from Changunarayan.According to Deputy Superintendent of Police Dhundiraj Neupane of the District Police Office, Bhaktapur, 45-year-old Hari Govinda Suwal from Changunarayan Municipality-5 succumbed to his injuries while undergoing treatment at Bhaktapur Hospital. Four others—35-year-old Radhika Awal, 60-year-old Gopal Koju, 44-year-old Radheshyam Sitikhu, and 74-year-old Purnakesi Shilpakar—suffered minor injuries and were discharged after receiving treatment at the hospital.The 48-year-old driver, Ganesh Suwal, from Bhaktapur Municipality-2, is currently undergoing treatment at the hospital. \nThe Kathmandu Metropolitan City has designated 47 locations for floriculturists and flower vendors to sell flowers in Tihar.The city office’s move aims to avoid the inconvenience the floral vendors faced last year and reduce congestion on the sidewalks.“This year, we have designated 47 locations, most of them in shopping malls, marts, parks and party palaces,” said Dharma Raj Bhandari, a police inspector at the city office. “Farmers and vendors can take their products to those designated places and do business at their convenience. Our staff will help them reach the designated areas if they can not do so on their own.”Last year, many floral farmers from the adjoining districts of the Kathmandu Valley who brought flowers in the capital city could not sell their products due to restrictions the city office imposed in many places.The farmers were then allowed to sell flowers at Bhrikutimandap, Tinkune park, Handigaun and Balaju Valley Cold Store in coordination with the Floriculture Association of Nepal and the Nepal Chamber of Commerce. However, farmers and vendors discarded piles of flowers and garlands on footpaths and returned home, incurring heavy losses.The metropolis had deployed its staffers, including the metropolis police, to collect discarded flowers and garlands, which were dumped at the landfill site in Bancharedanda.Officials say that the malls, party palaces and parks will not charge farmers and vendors for providing space for selling flowers and garlands. KMC officials discussed the matter with the owners of the malls and party palaces and requested them to provide spaces for farmers to sell flowers and garlands in Tihar.“Floral farmers and vendors can sell flowers from other private places, but we will not allow them to obstruct footpaths,” said Laxmi Maharjan, a senior assistant sub-inspector of the KMC. “This year, we designated specified sales points in advance to avoid repeating last year’s situation.”The metropolis has also requested that people use flowers produced by Nepali farmers in Tihar and prohibit the sale, storage, distribution and use of plastic bouquets and flowers.“We have already confiscated plastic bouquets and flowers from many places,” said Maharjan. “We will fine traders if they ignore our warnings.”The metropolis has asked floral farmers and vendors to call the hotline 1180 or 015901763 and 9851356509 for help. \nA leader of the tea labour union in Darjeeling has asked India’s central government to stop the import of Nepali tea, claiming that it has harmed the Darjeeling tea brand.For the last few years, the demand to ban or impose an import duty on tea from Nepal has been growing louder in Darjeeling.Mamata Banerjee, the chief minister of West Bengal, India, visited Darjeeling a week ago and promised to halt the import of tea from Nepal. Earlier, in June, Santosh Kumar Sarangi, director general of India’s foreign trade, interacting with the Federation of Indian Export Organisations in Kolkata, said that both Darjeeling Tea and Nepal tea should be sold separately. While tea imports from Nepal could not be banned, mixing should be checked, he said.According to media reports, Sarangi said it was not possible to ban the import of Nepal tea due to geopolitical reasons. “As far as trade with Nepal is concerned, some flexibility is required,” he was quoted as saying on the occasion. Regarding the mixing of Darjeeling Tea and Nepal tea, there may be some collusion,” he said. A former chairman of the Tea Board, Sarangi, said the board had developed a traceability app for Darjeeling Tea.Shanta Chhetri, a former Rajya Sabha member, is the latest to raise the issue, demanding a 40 percent import duty on tea from Nepal. Sunil Rai, joint secretary of the Darjeeling Terai Dooars Chia Kaman Mazdoor Union, during a function in Siliguri demanding a bonus hike for Darjeeling tea labourers, said that Nepali tea sold in the name of Darjeeling tea should be banned.“Both West Bengal and the central government [of India] should take this initiative.”The function was organised to demand bonus hikes for Indian tea labourers, but it was centred more on Nepali tea.Speakers at the function also called for serious testing of the quality of Nepali tea.“Initially, we raised the issue of restricting Nepali tea. But the government has not paid attention to it. This will complicate the issue more in the future,” said Rai.In 2016, the Indian tea entrepreneurs and labour union submitted a memorandum to the then-Indian president, Pranav Mukharjee, demanding a ban on Nepali tea. The government did not take the demand seriously, and as a result Indian tea entrepreneurs and labour unions are still upset, according to reports.Labour leaders are of the view that Nepali tea has directly impacted Darjeeling tea.“To protect the tea industry, the central government needs to ban Nepali tea immediately,” said Rai.Nepali tea is mainly exported to India. According to Rai, an opportunist trade group exports the same tea to third countries with a ‘Darjeeling tea’ label.“Once Nepali tea is stopped, the demand for Darjeeling tea will increase sharply,” said another labour union leader. “Or else we are sure that the brand of Darjeeling tea will be tarnished gradually.”Labour unions believe that both the state and central governments need to take urgent action to protect the pride of the Darjeeling brand in the global market.Udaya Chapagain, director of Gorkha Tea Estate in Ilam, said that since the topography of Ilam and Darjeeling is similar, Nepali tea closely resembles Darjeeling tea. “This has caused many Indian tea entrepreneurs to fear losing global market share.”“India has a strategy to limit Nepali tea under different pretexts. For this, the Nepal government needs to pay attention on time.”In April, trucks laden with tonnes of tea destined for the southern neighbour got stuck at the Panitanki Customs across the Nepal-India border, as India asked its customs authorities to test the quality of Nepali tea bound for India.The halt came after India’s Commerce Ministry issued a circular to its customs offices to test the quality of all tea imports from Nepal.In 2005 and 2015, the Commerce Ministry of India had issued a similar circular to its customs to conduct mandatory lab tests on Nepali tea.Nepali tea samples are tested at the National Food Laboratory, Kolkata, India.Around 92 percent of Nepal-produced tea that is exported to India goes through the eastern border point, while 6 percent is exported from Biratnagar and 2 percent from Birgunj.According to the Trade and Export Promotion Center, Nepal exported 13,916 tonnes of tea worth Rs3.62 billion in the last fiscal year that ended in mid-July.Nepal’s tea exports sharply jumped by 44.3 percent to Rs1.86 billion in the first three months of the current fiscal year, which ended in mid-October.During the review period, Nepal exported 6,495 tonnes of tea, which accounted for 4.87 percent of the country’s total trade.Demand for Nepali tea has been rising as the bushes in Darjeeling have aged. Therefore, Nepali traders say the tea leaves have become a valuable input for the factories in and around Darjeeling.For years, Indian buyers have been alleging that Nepali tea is substandard and, as a result, offer lower prices. Nepali tea is often stopped at different border points under various pretexts. \nThe price of gold dropped by Rs15,900 per tola (11.664 grams) on Monday following the government’s decision to decrease the customs duty on the precious yellow metal. According to the Federation of Nepal Gold and Silver Dealers Association, the price of hallmark gold has been set at Rs151,300 per tola for today, down from Rs167,200 on Sunday.The government has slashed the customs duty on gold imports by 50 percent, from 20 percent to 10 percent. This decision was made during a Cabinet meeting on Thursday.Through its budget, India reduced the customs duty on gold and silver from 15 percent to 6 percent. In contrast, Nepal had increased the gold customs duty by 5 percent, raising it to 20 percent in the current fiscal year’s budget. This made gold more expensive in Nepal and cheaper in India, leading to smuggling.The Federation said the imbalance in customs duties due to the open border encouraged illegal trade. To prevent such trade, the Federation suggested that the customs duty be set at 8 percent. \n\nThe Ministry of Health and Population has decided to inspect medical bills issued by health facilities following growing complaints from patients and their families about exorbitant charges, particularly in private hospitals. Patients and their relatives have also complained that private hospitals and medical colleges often do not inform them about fees at the time of treatment, only to impose excessive charges during discharge, according to officials.“We have received several complaints from patients and their relatives about the excessive charges by health facilities, and such complaints are growing every day,” said Dr Prakash Budhathoky, spokesperson for the ministry. “We have already directed all health facilities, including medical colleges, to publish their fee structures on their websites.”Officials said Minister for Health and Population Pradip Paudel himself expressed concern about these growing complaints and instructed officials to regulate the charges.As per the ministry’s circular, health facilities must disclose outpatient department charges, bed fees, surgery charges, and lab fees, among other things.“We have also requested health agencies under provincial and local governments to regulate health facilities,” said Budhathoky. “They are requested to check if patients are being overcharged by health facilities.”Health officials said they are also planning to audit doctors’ prescriptions to see whether unnecessary medicines and tests are being prescribed. For this, the ministry plans to seek help from professional councils such as the Nepal Medical Council, the Nepal Pharmacy Council, and other agencies concerned.Experts say most ailments can be treated with medicines costing just a few hundred rupees, but some doctors force patients to buy vitamin supplements costing thousands of rupees. Patients and their relatives have also lodged complaints with the ministry about doctors' alleged wrongdoings and collusion with health facilities. They also complained that some hospitals force patients to undergo unnecessary tests costing high fees.Officials at the health ministry hope that an audit of doctors’ prescriptions will help address patients' complaints and grievances. Prescription audit is a systematic analysis and is in practice in many countries across the globe. It is carried out to find errors in doctors’ prescriptions and improve patient care.Officials say the decision to carry out a prescription audit was made to discourage malpractices involving doctors, pharmacists, importers, drug manufacturers, and hospitals.Under pressure from hospitals, patients are often made to undergo unnecessary and costly tests or are kept admitted in hospitals longer than necessary.An official at the ministry, asking not to be named since he is not authorised to speak to the media, said the Department of Drug Administration has banned certain vitamin supplements prescribed by doctors and sold openly in the market in combinations with specified solutions and agents.Some doctors and dispensaries have been taking undue advantage of poor patients, forcing them to buy additional vitamin supplements, the official said, adding that most patients are unaware and don’t ask if the supplements are necessary.Medical experts say that vitamin supplements are only needed in specific conditions, but most doctors prescribe them unnecessarily.Experts hope the prescription audit will help minimise irrational prescribing, improper dispensing, unnecessary testing and the practice of taking undue advantage of ailing patients. \nMalaysia should introduce pneumococcal vaccines for adults and high-risk groups following the steady rise in pneumonia-related deaths, say health experts.While pneumococcal vaccination is already part of the National Immunisation Programme for children, they said there is no such programme yet for adults, the elderly, and those with chronic conditions.Federation of Private Medical Practitioners’ Associations Malaysia president Dr Shanmuganathan Ganeson said Malaysia should integrate this vaccine as it has great public health benefits.“Many countries have successfully reduced pneumonia-related morbidity and mortality by integrating pneumococcal vaccines. Malaysia should follow suit.“It will help reduce hospital admissions by preventing severe pneumonia and invasive diseases, decrease healthcare costs by minimising complications and intensive care needs, and promote herd immunity by lowering bacterial transmission to protect unvaccinated individuals.“Cost-effectiveness studies in other nations suggest that national-level vaccinations could have a long-term economic benefit alongside improved health outcomes,” he said in an interview yesterday.Calling pneumonia a “highly avoidable disease”, Dr Shanmuganathan noted a rise in pneumonia-related deaths, particularly in 2021, due to Covid-19.“Even after recovery, some individuals experienced secondary bacterial infections, further increasing pneumonia risks,” he added.He pointed out that strained healthcare capacity also delayed treatment for other respiratory conditions.At the same time, an ageing population and prevalent non-communicable diseases like diabetes and heart disease heightened pneumonia risks.“The rise of antibiotic-resistant strains like Streptococcus pneumoniae has complicated treatment.“Also, the lack of widespread adoption of the pneumococcal vaccine, especially among high-risk groups, leaves a significant portion of the population vulnerable,” he said.Dr Shanmuganathan said the pneumococcal vaccine effectively reduces the risk of severe pneumococcal disease.He added that the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) can prevent up to 80% of invasive diseases in children.“For the elderly and high-risk groups, the vaccine significantly lowers the risk of complications and death.“Its efficacy varies depending on the individual health status and the vaccine type – either the PCV or the pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV).“Importantly, it offers protection against antibiotic-resistant strains of pneumococcus, addressing a growing concern.“Malaysians, especially high-risk groups, should get the pneumococcal vaccine available in hospitals and clinics.“This includes children under two, adults over 65, those with chronic diseases and the immunocompromised,” he said, adding that increasing the awareness of the benefits of the vaccine and its availability at most clinics is important.With pneumonia now the leading cause of death, Dr Shanmuganathan said it is essential to update the Covid-19 vaccination programme, focusing on new variants like XEC and vulnerable populations.He emphasised that a broader respiratory health strategy is needed, including promoting pneumococcal and influenza vaccinations and ensuring early diagnosis and treatment of respiratory infections.“Private general practitioners should be kept informed of these developments.“The Health Ministry must remain proactive, despite diverting staff to address the doctor shortage in clinical sectors,” he said.Association of Private Hospitals Malaysia president Datuk Dr Kuljit Singh said while Covid-19 infections may have been reduced, influenza cases are rising, with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) becoming more recognised as a significant infection.As such, he said the government should consider including pneumococcal vaccines in Malaysia’s national vaccination programme.The vaccines, he added, should also be made readily available at private medical facilities and selected clinics.“Such a programme should be introduced as it would help reduce morbidity and mortality, especially in the high-risk population.“Vaccines should be made widely available to reduce the cost and burden of treating illnesses,” he said.Dr Kuljit suggested that those in the high-risk group consider getting vaccinated to better protect themselves against pneumonia.He said private medical centres are currently using the latest vaccine, Vaxneuvance, which helps protect against 15 types of pneumococcus.The cost of pneumococcal vaccines ranges between RM280 and RM400, depending on the type used.When asked, Dr Kuljit said the steady rise in pneumonia-related deaths in the past decade could be from the large number of high-risk populations due to the nation’s ageing population and those suffering from non-communicable diseases, which result in compromised immune systems.He also said the increase in cigarette and e-cigarette smoking could also be a factor in the rise of such cases.Smoking damages the cilia (tiny hair-like structures) in the respiratory tract that help clear pathogens and debris.“This dysfunction can lead to a higher risk of respiratory infections, including pneumonia,” he said.-In Association with ANN \nThe Ministry of Health and Population has planned a meeting with senior officials, including secretaries serving at provincial ministries in Kathmandu, for the preparation of the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination drive.Officials at the ministry said that such a meeting with senior provincial officials is necessary to hold relevant agencies responsible for the success of the nationwide drive.“We got a go-ahead from the health ministry,” said Dr Abhiyan Gautam, chief of the Immunisation Section at the Family Welfare Division under the Department of Health Services. “We also want provincial governments to shoulder the responsibility of making the nationwide vaccination drive successful.”Human papillomavirus is a viral infection that spreads through skin contact and is a major cause of cervical cancer. Cervical cancer is the second-most common cancer in the developing world and a major cause of death among Nepali women. It is estimated that hundreds of women get diagnosed with cervical cancer in Nepal every year.Doctors say most cases of cervical cancer are linked to HPV, and widespread immunisation could significantly reduce the impact of cervical cancer and other HPV-related cancers worldwide.Officials say that during the nationwide campaign, over 1.68 million girls between 10 and 14 years will be administered the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine.“All eligible girls aged between 10 and 14 years will be vaccinated during the campaign,” said Gautam. “The vaccine will be administered in two doses over 12 months, with one dose given at the start and the second after 12 months.”The vaccine will be included in the routine immunisation programme following the compilation of the nationwide campaign. The Global Alliance for Vaccine and Immunisation (GAVI) will supply doses of the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine in December and has also provided the campaign’s operation cost.Nepal also has to pay a certain percent of the cost of the vaccine once it is included in the regular immunisation list, officials say.“We have started preparations for the campaign,” said Gautam. “Health workers nationwide, who will be mobilised for the vaccination campaign, are being imparted with the necessary training.”According to the BP Koirala Memorial Cancer Hospital in Bharatpur, more than 700 women suffering from cervical cancer seek treatment at the hospital every year.Experts say early treatment can prevent up to 80 percent of cervical cancer cases.Countries like Bhutan, Sri Lanka, Thailand and the Maldives have introduced HPV vaccines nationally, while India and Indonesia have introduced them in some districts.In 2016, Nepal piloted HPV vaccines in Chitwan and Kaski districts. During the pilot programme, all girls aged between 11 and 13 years were given two doses of the vaccine.Last year, Nepal purchased 20,000 doses of the HPV vaccine and administered it to around 9,000 girls aged between 14 and 15 years from all seven provinces. Health authorities administered the vaccines at schools after other measures failed to increase vaccine uptake.The World Health Organisation says HPV vaccination is recommended as part of a coordinated strategy to prevent cervical cancer and other diseases caused by the virus. \nDisruptive noises from North Korean loudspeakers have caused residents near the inter-Korean border to suffer for months, with some complaining that their health has been compromised, according to local governments on Nov 21.Data from a recent mental health assessment in Gimpo, Gyeonggi province, has shown that 28 per cent of the participants are experiencing significant mental health concerns. Conducted by the city’s mental health welfare centre from Aug 8 to 14, it assessed 102 residents living close to the border in Wolgot-myeon and Haseong-myeon.The data indicates that two individuals fell into a “high-risk category” for mental health issues, while 27 were labelled as being in a “watch” category, dealing with notable symptoms of stress and anxiety. The remaining 73 residents were considered to be within a normal range.Predominantly affecting the elderly population – many in their 70s and 80s – the noise has resulted in symptoms, such as sleep disorders, heightened stress and anxiety. These symptoms have been reported since the broadcasts started last September, making their daily lives increasingly intolerable, according to the assessment.The broadcasts, which consist of peculiar sounds like sirens and metal clanging, stop and start repeatedly at all hours, with a range of noise levels, according to local reports.“The eerie, metal-grinding sounds permeate the day and night from the North, depriving us of sleep and making daily life a challenge due to constant fear and anxiety,” one resident described.“We plan to offer psychological counselling and psychiatric treatment for those interested, aiming to enhance residents’ mental stability,” a Gimpo city official said.“Additionally, we are proposing measures to the Gyeonggi province and the central government, including temporary housing support, and installation of soundproof windows and doors.”North Korean broadcasts have also caused residents of Ganghwa-gun, Incheon, to suffer.The Incheon government plans to install soundproof facilities in the Dangsan-ri area, starting in early 2025.The noises, first reported in late July and described as high-pitched and similar to scraping metal, also feature sirens and drums and persist around the clock.Officials in Seoul believe this may be a retaliatory measure by the North against South Korea’s resumption of loudspeaker broadcasts earlier that month. Additionally, it might serve as a tactic to prevent North Korean citizens from hearing South Korean propaganda.Since late July, the South Korean military has been blaring daily propaganda broadcasts into North Korea, in response to the North’s launch of trash-carrying balloons which began in late May.These broadcasts include K-pop songs and news critical of Mr Kim Jong Un’s regime, such as reports on the defection of North Korean diplomats and soldiers. -In Association with Asia News Network \nDusit Princess Kathmandu is organising a five-day trout festival at its SOI restaurant. The dishes will be available for order from 12:30 pm to 10:00 pm every day till August 30. In celebration of Nepal’s rivers and lakes, which provide an ideal environment for high-quality trout, the Director of Culinary Food and Beverage Service, Chef Utpal Mondal, and his team at Dusit Princess Kathmandu have crafted a menu showcasing the flavours and versatility of locally sourced trout. “As the festive month of Shrawan ends, people focus on healthy and nutritious food. Trout, rich in omega-3 fatty acids, vitamins, and essential minerals, offers a heart-friendly option that checks all the boxes from a nutritional and culinary standpoint,” says Mondal.He adds that the goal of the culinary event is to offer their guests a rare opportunity to experience a wide variety of trout dishes they wouldn’t typically find at home.The event menu features twelve unique dishes, six of which are drawn from diverse culinary traditions across continents. Three dishes are inspired by oriental cuisine, while the remaining three highlight flavours from Nepal and India. The menu has been designed to include various dishes, from soups and starters to main courses, including Mexican, Italian, Continental, and Thai flavours.While discussing the event’s highlights, Mondal said, “The celebration presents a unique opportunity for guests to indulge in a diverse range of trout-based dishes, something they wouldn’t typically have the chance to experience elsewhere.” \nI can vividly remember my first encounter with baking when I was 10 years old. We had just moved to our new home and got a cable connection. The cable opened a world of possibilities, as it gave me access to various contents.This was back in the late 2000s when YouTube would take hours to load, taunting us with its buffering screen. I was particularly drawn to travel and lifestyle channels, mainly TLC, Fox Life, and Food Network, which kept me informed about different foods and cultures. I don’t know why, but I was always drawn to desserts. It was fascinating to see how these miraculous treats made people smile at the end of the meal.Growing up in Nepal, I noticed that baking wasn't very common. While some families did have ovens, they were mostly multifunctional ones used primarily for heating food.I also noticed that most of our desserts didn't require an oven, as they could be made on a stovetop. So, you can imagine my excitement when my mom decided to buy an oven during one of her festive shopping sprees.I could finally feel the joy these channels portrayed. (I blame food writer Nigella Lawson for getting me hooked on a domestic lifestyle.) Then, one day, after watching one of the cooking episodes on television, I finally mustered enough strength and decided to bake something. I distinctly remember wanting to make a chocolate cake for myself after watching one of Rachel Allen’s bake series. I watched all the ingredients used in that recipe and scurried across my pantry, only to realise I didn’t have half of the stuff she mentioned. I then decided to improvise the recipe (a big mistake). I randomly combined the ingredients that I had in a mixing bowl and chucked the batter into my oven, hoping for a magical cake to pop out an hour later.After I saw the result an hour later, I was mortified. The cake was stuck in the pan, refusing to come out, and it was as dense as fudge. I convinced myself that the taste was what mattered most, but when I served a slice to my brother, he made a face of utter disgust.That was the day I realised that baking soda was not the same as baking powder.After this incident, I researched baking and found out it was technical. This was a blessing in disguise for me, as I loved science, and I started to view baking as a science experiment. I then reflected and evaluated how to perfect one's baking skills.I analysed my errors and noted down all the steps I did every time I baked. Home baking is a passion for many. The idea of turning a few simple ingredients into a delicious masterpiece is as enchanting as it sounds.Yet, for many of us, this seemingly magical process can often turn into a series of unfortunate events, leading to crumbled dreams and deflated ambitions. Dense cakes, burnt crusts, rock-hard cookies and unrisen bread, if you are an amateur baker, then you have seen it all. But why do these mishaps happen so often? And most importantly how do we overcome them?From my experience, behind every successful bake lies a series of challenges and mishaps that test even the most dedicated bakers. Baking has its own set of rules that you need to follow to get that scrumptious treat every time. So, to transform a recipe into an actual dish that will impress your friends and family, I am sharing with you some of the tips and tricks I learned from my tumultuous journey as a home baker.First things first, we have to look into the prime appliance that we are working with. Commercial ovens are of two types: one that runs on gas and the other that runs on electricity. We have to look at the oven present at our home and consider its pros and cons. The main benefits of a gas oven are its size and temperature control. One can quickly change the temperature just by twisting the knob, and it preheats much more quickly than an electric one. However, they are known to have uneven temperatures at times and release more humidity, making it harder to properly crisp or brown food. This can result in burnt edges and cold or hot spots. An electric oven, on the other hand, provides more even and consistent temperatures and doesn’t release as much moisture in the air.This dry oven environment makes it easier to brown your items, making it great for baking bread. However, while the dry oven results in more even cooking, you also run the risk of drying out cakes and other baked goods.Also, many people forget to preheat the oven before baking, which is crucial for maintaining an even temperature throughout the baking process. When baking cakes and bread, I like to place a small tray of water at the bottom of the oven to provide moisture and prevent the baked goods from drying out.An oven thermometer can be a baker's best friend, providing a true reading and ensuring your creations bake evenly. I also like rotating the pan midway while baking, as it allows for an even distribution of heat.The next thing people mess up on is measuring and the specificity of ingredients in a recipe. Our moms made our food with their instinct; it is something that they learned along the way, but when you are baking, you cannot instinctively add or omit a few steps.I think that is why we initially had problems with baking. In a culture where cooking comes instinctually, baking challenges us, to be precise. A gram of more or less of any ingredient can drastically alter the outcome. Different methods of measuring flour can yield different results.Every component in baking serves a distinct purpose and function. Flour offers structure, sugar adds sweetness and moisture, eggs bind things together, and butter enhances taste and texture. However, not all ingredients are created equally. For example, using salted butter instead of unsalted might change the taste profile of your meal.Similarly, different flours have varying protein concentrations, which affect the texture of baked goods. The type of sugar used also makes a difference. Granulated sugar, brown sugar, powdered sugar, and speciality sugars like turbinado or muscovado each add unique flavours to a bake.Understanding these nuances and how they interact is critical for getting the intended outcomes. Accurate measurement tools and techniques are essential, but mastering them can be a steep learning curve. So, I would recommend investing in a kitchen scale that allows for more accurate measurements by weight rather than volume.Moving on, leavening agents such as baking soda, baking powder, and yeast are required to make baked goods rise. However, they can also cause confusion and errors. Baking soda needs an acidic component to activate, but baking powder has both an acid and a base, making it self-activating.Using the wrong type of flour or sugar, or using them in incorrect proportions, can result in flat, overly raised, or collapsed cakes. Yeast, being a living organism, presents its challenges.The water temperature must be just right—not too hot to kill the yeast, nor too cold to inhibit its activity. Proofing times and conditions also need to be carefully managed to achieve the perfect rise.Bakers should also be careful about the way they mix ingredients. The method of mixing ingredients can significantly impact the final product. Over-mixing can develop too much gluten in cakes and pastries, leading to tough textures.Under-mixing can leave pockets of unincorporated ingredients, resulting in uneven bakes. Techniques like folding, creaming, and whipping each serve specific purposes and must be executed with care.Finally, home bakers must understand the importance of timing and patience in baking. Even a minute or two can make the difference between perfectly baked cookies and burnt edges.Recipes often provide a range for baking times, but factors like oven hot spots, pan material, and altitude can affect these times. It’s crucial to keep a close eye on your bakes and rely on visual and tactile cues, such as a cake pulling away from the sides of the pan or a toothpick coming out clean, to determine doneness.Baking is also an exercise in patience, a virtue not everyone possesses. Doughs need time to rest and rise, flavours need time to meld, and baked goods need time to cool before they can be enjoyed.Impatience can lead to underbaked centres, crumbling slices, and a general sense of frustration. Cultivating patience is as important as mastering any technique in the baker’s repertoire.Home baking is a journey full of ups and downs, but it comes with great rewards. The obstacles encountered teach valuable lessons in patience, precision, and perseverance.The satisfaction of success, the freedom to create, and the therapeutic benefits make the endeavour meaningful. Whether baking for oneself, loved ones, or as an artistic outlet, the journey is as fulfilling as the result. Embrace the flour-dusted countertops, occasional setbacks, and the joys of home bakingFor a beginner-friendly recipe that involves mixing ingredients and delivers amazing results, try my recipe for fudgy, nutty brownies that I call ‘Bliss Brownies’.Bliss Brownies150g unsalted butter plus extra for the tin150g chopped dark chocolate200g caster sugar½ tsp baking powder2 eggs80g cocoa powder150g plain flour70g mixture of nuts (walnuts and almonds)60g blended papayaMix all the ingredients (except the dark chocolate and nuts) in a blender or a food processor and blitz till you get a smooth paste.Fold the chocolate and the nuts into the brownie batter, making sure that the pieces are evenly mixed in.Grease a loaf pan with soft butter and dust with cocoa powder. Pour the batter into the loaf pan.Bake in a preheated oven at 170c for 40 minutes and let it cool in the oven for an hour. Enjoy with a cup of coffee or, as I like it, a scoop of vanilla ice cream. \nIn a world where acceptance and safety often seem difficult to attain, many queer individuals also struggle to find a safe space to express themselves. They have to hide their true self and face relentless judgement when going to public places like cafes and restaurants.This is the reality for countless LGBTQIA+ individuals. The need for a safe space for this community is not just a desire but a necessity—a space where one can be themselves. This struggle for safety and acceptance can be traced to crucial historical moments, such as the Stonewall Riots of 1969 in New York City.The Stonewall Inn was more than a bar; it was a refuge for the queer community. When police raided the bar, the community fought back. This series of violent confrontations, which began in the early hours of June 28, 1969, between police and gay rights activists, marked the beginning of the modern LGBTQIA+ rights movement. The spirit of Stonewall, the fight for dignity and the right to exist openly lives on in places like Inclusive Galaxy Restaurant in Kathmandu. Inclusive Galaxy beyond a restaurant is an ‘oasis’ for the queer community and beyond.Founded by Bishwaraj Adhikari, Mr Gay Handsome Nepal 2013, a human rights defender, the restaurant proves the power of safe spaces. It’s a place where the community can unite, free from the prejudice and hostility that often permeate their everyday lives.After years of working in the human rights sector, Adhikari and his partner developed the idea for Inclusive Galaxy. What began as a small cafe gradually evolved into a full-fledged restaurant, driven by the growing demand and support from the community.“In developed countries with strong LGBTQIA+ movements, you can find community areas like gay villages. These are created as safe spaces for people whose families and communities have excluded them. They also support new business ideas and pink tourism. I hope to see pink tourism develop in Nepal someday,” says Adhikari. His vision for Inclusive Galaxy goes beyond just being a restaurant. He aims to promote financial independence and empowerment within the queer community.Since its inception in February 2019, Inclusive Galaxy has become a key spot for many in Lazimpat, a relatively queer-friendly area in Kathmandu. The location is essential because the first LGBTQIA+ movement in Nepal started in 2001 through the Blue Diamond Society.Inclusive Galaxy, true to its name, welcomes everyone—queer and non-queer alike—to share a comfortable space. His vision was clear: to create a space where people of all genders and sexual identities could come together without fear of exclusion.“I didn’t want to make it exclusively for queer people because that would be excluding ourselves from society. Different groups need to live together and understand each other,” Adhikari explains.In the early days, the cafe attracted both queer and non-queer customers. However, when some of the residents learned about Adhikari’s identity and the nature of the clientele, there was a brief period of hesitation. “At first, I didn’t understand what was happening, but then I realised my identity was an issue for a few people. I believe people should be judged by others by their character, not by their gender or sexuality. Over time, as residents saw that we operated like any other cafe, they became more comfortable,” Adhikari reflects.Adhikari started Inclusive Galaxy to give queer individuals a place to be proud of themselves, counteracting the self-doubt and insecurity that hiding one’s identity can cause. This turned the cafe very quickly into a community hub. The journey was not without challenges, though. It was difficult to hire staff and cooks from the LGBTQIA+ community, and soon after the restaurant opened, the COVID pandemic made things even harder.Despite these difficulties, the doors of Inclusive Galaxy remained open. During the pandemic, many queer individuals, who were abandoned by their families or afraid to return home, found comfort at Inclusive Galaxy.Since many couldn’t afford to pay for meals, the restaurant provided free food from its resources. As the number of people needing meals grew to 20-30 daily, Adhikari started raising funds within the community.“During my time as an activist, many people came here not only for food but also to see an organisation where the queer community supports one another,” Adhikari says.“The time during COVID was difficult, but it brought me closer to the community.”Four years after its inception, the restaurant has garnered a loyal following. Sarosy Neupane, Miss Pink Nepal 2024 first runner-up, describes Inclusive Galaxy as her second home. She moved to Kathmandu to study in 2022. Being distant from her family, she started visiting Galaxy for meals that reminded her of home-cooked food. Over time, she grew attached to the café because of its welcoming atmosphere.“It’s heartwarming to see people from our community and different walks of life here. The founders even invite us to festivals like ‘Dahi Chiura Khane din,’” she shares.Neupane visits the cafe regularly and sometimes stays until 3 am, engrossed in conversations. “I hope more spaces like this can open in the future. If, unfortunately, this place were to close someday, I don’t think we’d have any other place to turn to,” she adds.Muna Chhetri, a trans woman who has been a loyal customer for three years, shares, “This is my safe space where I can truly be myself. I always feel judged in other restaurants, but that fear doesn’t exist here. It’s where even those who aren’t accepted at home can feel accepted.”Sahara Khadka Chhetri, owner of Pink Tiffany, Kathmandu’s first openly LGBTIQIA+ friendly restaurant and bar, frequently visits after managing the bar, appreciating the convenience of not cooking at home.She notes very few places like this cater to our community, and some even had to close during COVID. “As an entrepreneur, I know that sustaining these spaces is a challenge. But as more spaces like these open, they will make the way for a more inclusive and compassionate society.”The welcoming atmosphere at Inclusive Galaxy has also had a surprising effect on non-queer patrons. Samriddha Jung Rana, a twenty-year-old neighbour who identifies as straight, often visits the café and appreciates the importance of such spaces.“Previously, I didn’t know much about the queer community and didn’t care much. But now, coming into this café, I’ve been interested in their rights and issues. I’ve realised that we’re not so different after all. We are all human,” he remarks.The ventures like Inclusive Galaxy and Pink Tiffany have inspired hope for collaborative businesses between queer and non-queer groups. The recent initiative by the Nepal Tourism Board promoting Pink Tourism in April 2024 is a positive step. Still, Adhikari believes that more support is needed from the government and the private sector.Despite the progress, challenges remain. However, Adhikari remains optimistic about the future. He is working on plans to develop the restaurant into a homestay program in the future.“Like how different planets, asteroids, and stars make up a beautiful galaxy, people from all walks of life and identities make a beautiful society. I am happy that we are assimilating together in this space. We are not so different; we are all different and similar simultaneously,” he says. \nNepali chef Aditya Mishra established \"The Sewing Tin\" to elevate Nepali cuisine in New York, leveraging his Michelin-starred training and showcasing his signature dish, Confit Duck Chatamari, a fusion of traditional Nepali and modern culinary techniques.\nCeleus Baral, an aspiring baker, runs Bakeleus, an online bakery specializing in eco-friendly, homegrown pastries, showcasing her artistry and commitment to sustainability through handcrafted treats and recipes.\nKhokana, a village near Kathmandu, boasts historical architecture, temples (Sikali Temple), mustard oil mills, and the Sikali Jatra festival, while preserving its traditional lifestyle despite urban expansion.\nNature's challenges and personal growth collide on a transformative journey to Everest Base Camp, inspiring resilience, self-discovery, and appreciation for life's fragility and beauty.\nA group of journalists embarked on a five-day tour across Sri Lanka, covering historical and religious sites, including the Pidurangala Rock, Temple of the Tooth Relic, and Galle Fort, while also exploring the country's natural beauty, tea estates, and tourism industry potential.\nMundhum Trek in Koshi province in the eastern part of Nepal is a new cultural walking trail. It passes through several indigenous ethnic villages and landscapes in Khotang and Bhojpur districts. This trail goes up to an elevation of 4,200 metres to the viewpoint of Silchung Peak and takes one through the settlements of the Kirati people. This route starts from Diktel Bazaar and passes through beautiful settlements like Chakhewa, Rawa Dhap, Salpa Bhanjyang, Silchung and Hanspokhari before ending in Bhojpur. There are some hotels in Diktel but trekkers are advised to carry tents. The trail offers panoramic views of most of the eight-thousanders, including Everest, Lhotse, Makalu, Cho Oyu and Kanchenjunga mountains. The spring season, March through May, is highly recommended for the trek.Janaki Mandir Janaki Mandir at Janakpur in Madhesh province was constructed in 1874 and is a blend of Mughal and local architecture. The temple is a three-storey building and has 60 rooms, making it the largest temple in Nepal. Pilgrims flock here by the thousands to pay homage to Janaki Mandir—Janaki being the other name of Sita, the daughter of King Janak. The temple houses an idol of Sita which was found near Ayodhya, the kingdom of Ram. The marriage anniversary of Lord Ram and Sita is celebrated in Janakpur every year on Vivaha Panchami, which falls in December. In the southwest corner of Janaki Mandir is the Vivaha Mandap, which has been built at the site where the marriage of Ram and Sita is said to have taken place. Another well-known temple in the vicinity is Ram Mandir, which is built in pagoda style and is hence different from the other temples in Janakpur that generally bear resemblance to Mughal architecture. It houses a female statue, said to be of Yogamaya, which has the reputation of being one of the most beautiful images of female forms in Nepal. Other holy sites of interest include the Laxman Temple, Sankat Mochan Temple and Hanuman Temple.Kuri Village, Kalinchok Kuri village, a popular tourist destination around 150 km from Kathmandu, lies at an altitude of 3,842 metres above sea level in Kalinchowk of Dolakha district, in Bagmati province. People visit the place to enjoy the snow during the winter besides the mesmerising landscapes and splendid panoramic view of the Himalayan range. Kalinchok gets snow mainly at the end of December and the snowfall continues till the end of February or mid-March. When there is snow, it is difficult for jeeps, buses and cars to reach the top of Kuri village. Chains are wrapped around the wheels of vehicles and specially modified jeeps with highly experienced drivers are used to carry visitors. There are several hotels and restaurants in the area. The road up to Kuri has also improved over the years.Annapurna Base Camp Annapurna Base Camp trek, in Gandaki province, makes for a picturesque journey that takes you to the foothills of the Annapurna South, up to 4,130 metres above sea level. The five-day trek (seven days for slow walkers) offers rich cultural diversities, typical Nepali villages and the flora and fauna nestled at the foothills of Annapurna. The distance from Pokhara to Annapurna Base Camp is approximately 81 kilometres. It is among the shortest and most budget-friendly treks in Nepal. For Nepalis, lodging costs around $5 to $10 per day. For foreigners, the overall cost of the trek ranges from $800 to $1500 on average per person. Annapurna Base Camp trek can be done at any time throughout the year as each season offers a different trekking experience. The ideal time for the trek depends on your weather preferences and what you expect from it. However, autumn (September to October) and spring (March to May) are considered the two best seasons for the trek, as the days at the time are warm and bright with clear skies.Bardiya National Park Bardiya National Park, located in the southern Tarai belt of Lumbini province, is home to one of the most elusive and majestic animals on earth—the Royal Bengal Tiger. The park, which covers an area of 968 square kilometres, is considered one of the most important protected areas in the country. It is a prime destination for those looking to catch a glimpse of a tiger. A bit of luck and patience will offer a good chance to see the Bengal Tiger. The jungle safari also offers one the opportunity to spot Asian elephants and the greater one-horned rhinoceros. The rare Gangetic river dolphins are occasionally spotted on rafting trips along the Geruwa River, the eastern channel of the Karnali river. Besides, visitors can enjoy the homestays and explore local Tharu culture. The right time to visit the park is from mid-September to mid-December and mid-February to May.Khaptad National Park Khaptad National Park in Sudurpaschim province is a protected area in the far western region. It stretches over four districts of Bajhang, Bajura, Achham and Doti and ranges in elevation from 1,400 to 3,300 metres. The park can be visited throughout the year. Trekkers are advised to bring their tents, food and other supplies. The Nepal Tourism Board says of late, social media has been increasingly influencing Nepali travellers to go to Khaptad. Since the far-flung Khaptad National Park is still offbeat for many travellers, the area remains pristine and fresh. The seasons of spring (March-May) and autumn (October-November) are the ideal times to visit the park. The temperature ranges from 10°c to 20°c offering pleasant trekking weather. The monsoon begins in June and lasts until September and during this time, roads often become muddy and slippery. From December to February, winter brings snow and chilling winds to the park.Limi Valley \nOnce again, my heart swelled with joy when my hometown came into view.Arriving at Lalikharka after the treacherous journey through Pauwa Bhanjyang and the bustling Kanchhi Dokan, Phidim, the headquarters of Panchthar district, revealed itself like a surprise gift. My home town, Phidim, is unique in the fact that it reveals to travellers approaching it from uphill. As the vehicle descends the mountain road, it slowly comes into view, its houses and buildings recognisable for the native son.This Dashain, I undertook the much-awaited trip to my hometown with my wife Kabita and daughter Aarohi. Little did I anticipate the transformation that awaited me.The moment I got out of the jeep, I noticed that Phidim, nestled in the lush hills, has undergone a remarkable transformation over the years. As I guided my family to my home, which had suffered damages in the 1989 quake that struck eastern Nepal, I found that old, mud and stone houses had been replaced by concrete buildings. The place was vastly different from the one I remembered.Arriving at my childhood home felt like reuniting with an old friend. Navigating its nooks and crannies with my daughter, we delved into the history of the house, a symbol of my cherished memories.My wife had visited Phidim years ago, spending a month with my parents. She, too, recalled beautiful moments she had had in the town. I asked the tenant about the neighbours and acquaintances. Some had died, while others had left for good.A call to local journalist Giriraj Banskota led me to the school grounds, where memories flooded back. This was where I spent my teenage years, playing ball, learning to kick, and watching major tournaments. Here, I even encountered a group of Western climbers headed to Kanchenjunga, the world’s third-highest mountain. I remember being awed by their shiny yellow tents, headlights and strange smell. I remember practising my tutephuteko Angrezi with the climbers. Birendra Shield, an annual sports tournament named after the late king, brought ace players from various schools in Panchthar district. The district also hosted Yuba Mela, an annual three-day fair to commemorate the birthday of the king, organising football tournaments in which teams from as far as Sunsari and Taplejung participated. I never excelled at dribbling balls. A boy growing up in a seven-member family, I soon found my interest in literature. In the late 1980s, Phidim hosted a major literary festival. In the run-up to the 1990 pro-democracy protest, walls were painted with anti-monarchy slogans, local politicians were arrested. I took my family to my school, Naya Namuna Secondary School. It was Saturday, so the school was closed. I peeked through the steel gate and wall, imagining myself labouring over classes. Memories are hazy, but what I remember most is going out of the school—to quiz contests with me leading the school team, to essay competitions at the District Education Office and to play carom board, a national pastime, in a nearby shopfront. Returning to the main street, the demolition of a landmark gate made me reflect on how cities transform, shedding old landmarks for new identities. Navigating narrow alleyways, I felt like a stranger in my own hometown. Multistory buildings have emerged and roads have been paved, reshaping the town. It’s the same place with a different face, leaving me nostalgic for the Phidim of my memories.We finally reached Shivalaya temple, which I told my wife and daughter was one of my cherished hangouts. A giant statue of Falgunanda (the Kirant leader’s birthday is celebrated on November 10) stood before the steps to the temple. Though my wife suspected I came here to smoke, in reality, I visited the temple in the evening to meet friends and talk about issues that mattered most to us at the time. It also offered a panoramic view of the town (I could not take my family to Gadhi Danda, a hillock across the Shivalaya).Towards the end of my journey, I felt sad about Phidim’s lack of prospects. To my dismay, I found that people have been leaving the town in droves. Despite blacktopped roads and multi-story buildings, Phidim faces a troubling reality. The lack of quality higher education and specialist healthcare has driven people away, echoing the circumstances that led me to Kathmandu years ago. Conversations with locals confirmed a mass exodus from the town, a trend that raises concerns about Phidim's future.My conversations with familiar strangers led me to conclude that Phidim has transformed into a transit town for pilgrims heading to Pathibhara Devi Temple, which is around 255 kilometres north in Taplejung district. I met dozens of people headed to the holy site. While pilgrims see it as a stopover, for me, it was a homecoming. The realisation dawned that Phidim is, perhaps, in a state of transition, trading its rustic charm for the hallmarks of urbanisation. While I left Phidim for higher education in Kathmandu, people from rural areas have flocked to the town in search of better opportunities, bringing life and energy to the once quiet community.As we bid adieu to my hometown, I couldn’t help but reflect on the inevitability of leaving a place, no matter how enamoured one is with it. Passing Kanchhi Dokan, I pointed out Kanchnajungha and Kumbhakarna to my daughter—symbols of my childhood. Phidim, now a blend of nostalgia and change, remains etched in my heart, a testament to the intricate dance between memory and evolution. \nToran Bikram Shahi took the lead after the first round as Surya Nepal Central Open, the first event under Surya Nepal Golf Tour 2024-25, kicked off at the par-72 Gokarna Golf Club on Monday.Shahi carded 5-under 67 to remain at the top of the leaderboard.

The tournament features six teams: Nepal, India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, and South Africa. \nRussian forces are making rapid gains in Ukraine, capturing an area half the size of London in the past month, including territory in the Donetsk region and the towns of Pokrovsk and Kurakhove.\nIsrael and Iran-backed Hezbollah looked set to reach a ceasefire deal on Tuesday, Israeli and Lebanese officials said, clearing the way for an end to the conflict that has killed thousands of people since it was ignited by the Gaza war 14 months ago.A senior Israeli official and Lebanese Foreign Minister Abdallah Bou Habib appeared optimistic that a deal could be reached, cooling a second front for Israel's military that is also battling the Palestinian militant group Hamas in Gaza.Israel’s security cabinet is expected to convene later on Tuesday to likely approve a text at a meeting chaired by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, a senior Israeli official said.This would pave the way for a ceasefire declaration by US President Joe Biden and French President Emmanuel Macron, four senior Lebanese sources told Reuters on Monday.At a conference in Rome, Lebanese Foreign Minister Abdallah Bou Habib expressed hope that a deal to end the deadliest spillover from the Gaza war could be sealed by Tuesday night.The agreement requires Israeli troops to withdraw from south Lebanon and Lebanon’s army to deploy in the region - a Hezbollah stronghold - within 60 days, officials say. Hezbollah would end its armed presence along the border south of the Litani River.Bou Habib said the Lebanese army would be ready to have at least 5,000 troops deployed in southern Lebanon as Israeli troops withdraw, and that the United States could play a role in rebuilding infrastructure destroyed by Israeli strikes.Brokered by the US and France, Israel has all security concerns.Israel demands effective UN enforcement of an eventual ceasefire with Lebanon and will show “zero tolerance” toward any infraction, Defence Minister Israel Katz said on Tuesday.The agreement with Lebanon will maintain Israel’s freedom of operation there to act in defence to remove threats posed by Hezbollah and enable displaced residents to return safely to their homes in northern Israel, Israeli government spokesperson David Mencer told Reuters.Signs of a diplomatic breakthrough have been accompanied by a military escalation. Israeli airstrikes on Tuesday demolished more of Beirut’s Hezbollah-controlled southern suburbs, while the armed group has kept up rocket fire into Israel.The UN rights chief voiced concern about the escalation of hostilities in Lebanon, where his office said nearly 100 people had been reported killed by Israeli airstrikes in recent days, including women, children and medics.Israel says it targets military capabilities in Lebanon and Gaza and takes steps to mitigate the risk of harm to civilians. It accuses Hezbollah, like Hamas in Gaza, of hiding among civilians, which they deny.‘The Missiles are Chasing Us’Israel has dealt Hezbollah massive blows since going on the offensive against the group in September, killing its leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah and other top commanders, and pounding areas of Lebanon where the group holds sway.“Regarding the ceasefire, I think it will be implemented. Both sides are tired - both sides are tired,” said Selim Ayoub, a 37-year-old mechanic from Beirut’s southern suburbs.Hezbollah launched some 250 rockets on Sunday in one of its heaviest barrages yet. The northern Israeli city of Nahariya came under more rocket fire overnight.Diplomacy to end the fighting has focused on restoring a ceasefire based on UN Security Council Resolution 1701, which ended the last major war between Hezbollah and Israel in 2006.Israel’s ambassador to the United Nations, Danny Danon, said on Monday that Israel would maintain the ability to strike southern Lebanon under any agreement.Lebanon has previously objected to Israel being granted such a right, and Lebanese officials have said such language is not included in the draft proposal.Two Israeli officials told Reuters that Israel has a side agreement with the US allowing it to take action in Lebanon against “imminent threats.”Hezbollah, seen as a terrorist group by Washington, has endorsed its ally Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri to negotiate.Death and DestructionOver the past year, more than 3,750 people have been killed in Lebanon and over one million have been forced from their homes, according to Lebanon’s health ministry, which does not distinguish between civilians and combatants in its figures.The widespread destruction left by Israeli airstrikes has brought into focus a huge reconstruction bill awaiting cash-strapped Lebanon, with many left homeless heading into winter.Hezbollah strikes have killed 45 civilians in northern Israel and the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights. At least 73 Israeli soldiers have been killed in northern Israel, the Golan Heights and in combat in southern Lebanon, according to Israeli authorities.A ceasefire would pave the way for 60,000 people to return to homes in northern Israel, which they evacuated as Hezbollah began firing rockets in support of its Palestinian ally Hamas a day after that group's October 7, 2023 assault. \nPrince Harry and other high-profile British figures’ privacy lawsuits against the Daily Mail newspaper’s publisher will go to trial in early 2026, London’s High Court heard on Tuesday, with the parties’ legal costs set to exceed 38 million pounds ($47.8 million).Harry, the younger son of King Charles, is one of seven claimants suing Associated Newspapers over allegations of voicemail interception – commonly known as phone-hacking – and other serious privacy breaches dating back 30 years.Associated, which also publishes the Mail on Sunday, has always denied involvement in unlawful practices. Its lawyers said in filings for a preliminary hearing on Tuesday that the claimants’ allegations were “firmly denied”.The publisher’s attempt to throw out the lawsuits was rejected last year, paving the way for a trial which the claimants and Associated say should begin in early 2026.Lawyers representing the claimants, who also include singer Elton John and actors Elizabeth Hurley and Sadie Frost, expect to spend around 18.4 million pounds up to and including the trial, with Associated incurring nearly 20 million pounds, according to court filings made public on Tuesday.Harry and the other claimants’ lawsuits, which were filed in 2022, marked the first time Associated had been dragged into the phone-hacking scandal, which emerged more than a decade ago and prompted a public inquiry into the ethics of the press and several criminal trials.It also sparked long-running litigation against Rupert Murdoch’s British newspaper arm, News Group Newspapers, and the publisher of the Daily Mirror, Mirror Group Newspapers (MGN).Harry’s case against Associated is one of several he has brought against British media organisations as part of his “mission” to purge executives and editors whom he accuses of spreading lies and intruding into people’s lives.The prince accepted substantial damages from MGN to settle the remainder of his phone-hacking lawsuit, having been awarded 140,600 pounds (around $178,000) after the High Court ruled he had been targeted by journalists.Harry’s case against News Group Newspapers is due to go to trial in January. \nAn ethnic minority army that is part of a formidable rebel alliance fighting Myanmar’s ruling military has announced its willingness to hold talks with the junta after a year-long battle along the Myanmar-China border.The Ta’ang National Liberation Army’s (TNLA) decision, announced late on Monday, comes as powerful neighbour China puts pressure on rebels amid the rapid degeneration of the military, which Beijing has long seen as a guarantor of stability.Myanmar has been in turmoil since the military ousted an elected government led by democracy icon Aung San Suu Kyi in 2021, sparking a resistance movement that began as peaceful protests and later evolved into an armed rebellion on multiple fronts.The TNLA in a statement on its official Telegram channel said it wanted a halt to the military’s air strikes in its region of northern Shan state and expressed its desire for talks and its appreciation for China's mediation effort.“Our civilians are suffering from air strikes and other difficulties. So, we need to find a way out,\" TNLA spokesperson Lway Yay Oo said.The TNLA is part of a coordinated offensive launched last year called \"Operation 1027,\" named after its start date, which has become the biggest challenge to Myanmar’s generals since their coup, resulting in their loss of several towns and military posts.The other two groups in the alliance, the Arakan Army and the Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army, did not immediately respond to requests for comment.China’s foreign ministry on Tuesday said Beijing opposes any outbreak of war and chaos in Myanmar and urged all parties to cease fighting and resolve conflicts through dialogue.\"China will continue to actively promote peace talks and provide support and assistance to the best of its ability to the peace process in northern Myanmar,\" spokesperson” Mao Ning said at a regular news briefing.The rebel alliance had previously reached a ceasefire in January with Myanmar’s military during China-mediated talks, but the deal collapsed in June and fighting resumed.A spokesperson for Myanmar’s junta did not answer calls from Reuters.Myanmar’s parallel administration, the National Unity Government (NUG), said Beijing must consider the desires of Myanmar’s people when getting involved in the country’s crisis.“I want to encourage China not to conduct meetings which go against the will of Myanmar people as they will not be helpful to the country’s peace,” said its spokesperson Kyaw Zaw. \nChaaaiiittt…The spontaneous eruption of the sound of victory thundered through the neighbourhood of Nhyokha in the Kathmandu core. The line of a kite cut another. Looking out the window of her house, Sajani Shrestha saw children running full speed, shouting and fighting as they vied to catch the falling kite and thread. And craning her neck up to the sky, she could not count but only be mesmerised by the innumerable kites strewn across the skies of Nhyokha, Bangemudha, Indrachowk. “There would be so many kites that they entirely covered the blue of the sky, making beautiful patterns of different colours,” says the 51-year-old. “And you cannot imagine the number of times the call of chait rang in the air.”Clear blue sky and gentle westerlies, the season of kites has arrived in the Kathmandu Valley. While kites soared Kathmandu's sky mainly during Dashain, the kite season officially started in Nag Panchami (August) and ended on the Haribodhini Ekadashi (November). And from royalities to commoners, young and old all flew kites from rooftops and open grounds. Even those who did not, like Sajani, revelled in the live spectacle in the sky as kites soared and fought. With Bhimsen Thapa’s help, King Girvanyuddha flies kites The earliest written account of kite flying is believed to date to 200 BC in China. In Kathmandu, this tradition has religious and socio-cultural and environmental significance, says Tina Manandhar, lecturer of Nepalese History, Culture and Archaeology at Tribhuvan University. According to her, it is believed that kites in Kathmandu skies carry a message to the god of rain Indra that the valley's farmers have had enough rain for their crops. That is why Kathmandu farmers scolded anyone flying kites before plantation season.In an article ‘Changako Utpati Ra Bikas’ published in Gorkhapatra in 1995, historian Rajesh Gautam points to the lack of written documents indicating the exact time when kite culture was introduced in Nepal. Exploring different opinions on kite's introduction to Nepal, he writes that “some have opined the possibility that the skill and tradition of kite flying might have entered Nepal through India.” Yet some others, he writes, state that kites “came to Nepal from Japan during the time of [Rana PM] Dev Shumsher.”He concludes that most likely this tradition was introduced by Malla-era Newar traders: “But since Nepal’s relationship with Tibet and China is very old and direct, kites might have entered Nepal through the Newar traders who were engaged in the trade. One can estimate that the kite was introduced to Nepal during the (mediaeval) Malla regime.”In Social History of Nepal, TR Vaidya, Tri Ratna Manandhar and Shankar Lal Joshi write that there exists documented evidence of the kite flying from the early 19th century. The authors state that Sundarananda, a contemporary poet, has mentioned that the young king Girvanyuddha Bikram Shah (r.1799-1816), with the help of Prime Minister Bhimsen Thapa, flew kites from the towering temple of Taleju Bhawani, Hanumandhoka. And when the king's kite cut the kites of the youngsters, they were located and rewarded with money.In Tyas Bakhatko Nepal, Sardar Bhim Bahadur Pandey states that “During the month of Kartik [October-November] young and old all flew kites,” suggesting that kite culture was ubiquitous in Kathmandu by the early twentieth century.Anticipations and preparationsKite flying in Nepal requires a kite, a lattai (a wooden spool), thread and majha (homemade adhesive prepared by boiling snail slime, rice or sago, and powdered glass from burnt electric bulbs and coated on the line to sharpen it for kite fighting).77-year-old Nirmal Man Tuladhar, an avid kite flyer and retired professor of Linguistics at the Tribhuvan University, explains how Nepali tradition of kite flying was both expensive and needing advance preparation.“In our times, it wasn’t easy to fly kites,” he says. “We had to prepare majha …And as Nepali kites are fighter kites, we mainly fought with other kites [which meant we spent a lot of threads].”This preparation needed first and foremost of passing a hurdle: securing finances and materials to fly kites. While lattai was a one-time investment that could be saved for years, kites and threads had to be replenished every time a kite was cut.“Those were the times when parents wanted us to be more focused in our studies. They only gave money [to buy kites] after immense pestering,” says 80-year-old Dwarika Nath Dhungel, former Secretary of Nepal government, speaking of the 1950s and 1960s.Biodiversity specialist and botanist Tirtha Bahadur Shrestha, 86, was born in Mahabouddha and began flying kites from 1951-52. He saved what little money he got for afternoon snacks to buy Hattimar reel, a brand of line wound in a small lattai, which was strong and sharp and where majha stuck well.Raghuji Pant, a member of parliament, also recalls the difficulty in securing money to sustain his kite flying in and around Kathmandu core in the 1960s and early 1970s. “Four to five of my kites were cut in a day,” writes the 67-year-old in his 2019 article “Changa Jastai Udi Hidne Man” published in Himalkhabar. “[This caused] the line in the spool to shorten. From Bhadra [August-September] to one to one and a half months after Dashain I spent flying kites. So, it was difficult for me to have enough kites even after getting money from grandfather, grandmother, mother and everyone.”Kites and thread secured, now began the crucial work of preparing and applying majha whose strength determined how well it cut other kites. Govinda Tandon, 70, a historian and heritage expert, who grew up in Battisputali, was also an ardent kite flyer.“Materials for making majha were prepared right from the morning on a holiday,\" he writes in his article “Dashainko Butte Changa” published in Gorkhapatra. “Because this work couldn’t be accomplished without a collaboration of 3-4 friends, a holiday was set aside for this. Moreover, a sunny day was considered appropriate. If the majha didn’t dry, the thread could turn moist, and so if it felt like the day wouldn’t be sunny, the entire plan…was aborted.”Kite makers, kite sellers and variety of kites One of the oldest shops in Kathmandu's memory, Shree Chitrakar Kite Center in Tyauda, Asan is bustling with customers during Dashain. “When my grandmother got married and came to this house at age 12 [in early 1940s], this shop was already here,” says its fourth generation owner 47-year-old Dinoj Chitrakar. “So the shop must be around a hundred years old.”Another shop that stands out in Kathmandu's memory is Manandhar Kite Center in Kalimati, established in 1949, and currently run by brothers Mohan Man and Sundar Man Manandhar.In his book Antar Taranga, artist and writer Manuj Babu Mishra recalls “a kite shop near the old halwai shop of Chabahil” in the 1940s. Dhungel and his 1960 batchmates of Juddhodaya Public School recall the kite shops from the 1950s and 1960s – Bekhacha’s Shop at Netapacho, Bhaicha’s Shop at Nhyokha, Lata Manandhar’s Shop at Maru, Kanchha Buddha Bajracharya Shop at Tyauda.Besides the shops, there were makers and sellers of kites cloistered in different localities of Kathmandu Valley.In Kwalkhu, Patan was a Joshi who made Nepali paper kites.“One day I accompanied my uncle to buy kites,\" writes Dibya Giri, 69, in his 2023 article “Changa” in Sahitya Post. “I was amazed to see the huge stacks of kites there. We used to call it the house of the kite maker.”In Nhyokha, Purna Bahadur Shrestha began making kites as a teenager and started his own kite business in the 1950s, according to his daughter Sajani.These kites, made out of Nepali paper, often had different paintings. Mishra recalls painting kites for the kite shop in Chabahil.“I went to that kite shop and with the freely available colours and Nepali papers, I spent my day painting faces, birds, animals, masks, mountains, hills, whatever came to my mind,” he writes in the book. “Such kites apparently sold well!”Most septuagenarians and older generations like Tuladhar and Tirtha Bahadur recall flying kites made of Nepali paper when young. Tirtha Bahadur says that kites from Lucknow began coming to Kathmandu only after the late 1950s. But at least a section of Kathmandu was flying kites from Lucknow from the early twentieth century. Vaidya, Manandhar and Joshi write that the Ranas and Shahs imported kites from Lucknow and that from them, their favourite employees also got to fly some. These kites were large and, in Tyas Bakhatko Nepal, Pande writes that they were referred to as Lucknowia kites.Known for their characteristic hissing sound they made while flying, light body, swift movement and ability to take sharp turns, Lucknow kites were preferred by kite fighters.“Lucknow kites were lighter and could be manoeuvred well,” says Tuladhar. “Kites of Nepali paper were stable but difficult to manoeuvre. They were also expensive. So only some fighters flew Nepali paper kites.”The kites had different names depending upon their designs and colours – Ambe (a heart in the centre), Dibdibe (chequered), Pakhete (a different coloured paper on one edge), Sete (white-coloured), Nilchi (blue-coloured), Rate (red-coloured) and so on.The kite fighters preferred the strong and sharp Hattimar reel that came on a small lattai. The Belchamar reel was cheaper but weaker and prone to be cut by other threads. Kite fliers and kite watchers on rooftops and open groundsBibek Shrestha, 57, and his two brothers took stacks of kites and climbed their rooftops. The rooftops around theirs in the neighbourhood of Nhyokha – in fact in all core settlements of the Valley – were filled with kite fliers and spectators. Many risked precariously balancing on the sloped roofs.While Bibek and his brothers’ kites alighted to meet the sea of kites in the sky, their sister Sajani and other family members gathered around to revel in the live spectacle.Dhungel remembers the rooftops of Jhochhen and surroundings of the 1950s and 1960s swelled with kite fliers. Dhungel did try to fly kites. But he did not become a successful kite flyer. What he did become was, like Sajani and many Kathmandu residents, an admirer of kites soaring in the sky.“But more than engaging in my unsuccessful kite flying attempts, I enjoyed looking at the kites flying. There would be a big crowd of spectators. Females and other family members watched the kites fly as they ate meat and chiura. Some even drank and rejoiced as they flew kites.”When the age of cassette player and speakers dawned in the 1980s, songs blared from the speakers alongside kite flying. Chitrakar and Bibek invited their friends, put their favourite songs on speakers and spent entire afternoons flying kites, dancing, singing and eating.Away from the core cities, in the villages in the Valley, people flew kites in open fields. Like Dibya, who set his kite for flight from the banks of Godavari River in Tikathali. Chhauni was also a popular space for flying kites.Kathmandu’s joy in kite fightingBibek pulled his kite down and then manoeuvred it back up so his line touched his opponent's line from below and quickly reeled out his line. The resulting sharpness from the speed cut the opponent's line.Chaaaiiitttt………“The greatest fun comes from cutting another kite's string,” writes Tuladhar in his 1996 article “Cutting is the greatest fun” published in magazine Kite Lines. “With its coating of adhesive paste and ground glass, the string is as sharp and abrasive as sandpaper on your opponent's line.”Nepali kite, Tuladhar says, is made to fight other kites, and describes how a kite line cuts the other.“The technique is to touch your rival's string and immediately reel out line at high speed,” he writes. “The Nepalese style of kite flying is aggressive, and though the kites look simple, they are strategically designed for bringing down other kites.”At any given time, like Bibek’s kite above Nhyokha sky, skies above the Valley were filled with raging kites, swinging, coming down and going up as the fighters reeled in and out their lattais in ferocious attempts to bring down other kites.Meanwhile spectators cheered. “Even passersby stopped to look at the kites,” recalls Tina.The moment of a kite cutting was accompanied by the sound of chait, and children ran in the direction of the falling kite to grab it and the thread in what was termed as, Dibya says, changa lutne/dhago lutne.Dhungel always joined in to shout the chait resounding through the locality of Jhochhen and almost automatically his feet sped towards the severed kites' direction.“‘Oii leave that thread,’ the kite owner would scold me. ‘Why do you pull my thread, leave it right now.’ But I’d continue pulling the threads as the owner continued shouting. Other times I caught the kites that had failed to fly and dropped on the ground.”The fallen kites got stuck in the buildings, trees or poles, or glided down in the open grounds or paddy fields. Falling kites from the Kathmandu core settled down in Tundikhel covering it. Oftentimes kites fell on the fields to rest upon the lush paddy nearing its harvest.“Children ran straight into the fields to catch the kite,” says Dibya. \"They destroyed the crops by stepping on them. Some farmers chased them, scolding along as they did so and if they caught anyone, they slapped them.”Love and restrictions on kiteAmidst the raging kite fights high up in the sky, there were apparently also some quieter kites lingering much lower among the buildings or tree lines, for their goals lay in not ruthlessly cutting the threads of other kites but piercing softly through the hearts of their owners' love interests. During the Rana regime, there were designated public spaces to fly kites, writes Gautam in his article. Referring to oral accounts, he writes that the Ranas were particularly careful to avoid kite flyers around their durbars. This is because love-stricken men tied letters to kites and flew them into the durbars to their love interests among the nanis.He writes that the kites could be flown mainly on the grounds of Chhauni. Anyone flying kites in any other place and around Rana durbars were arrested.Pant also recalls love-stricken boys from his time. “Just as kites came in different colours and patterns, so did kite flyers,” he writes in the article. “Some wrote love letters using a few words in “symbolic language” on a plain kite and attempted to land it on the rooftop of the girl they liked. Some simply landed their kites on any rooftop if a girl appeared there and waited for reaction.”King Tribhuvan among kite fliersPande writes in his book: “Once or twice during kite season every year, King Tribhuvan went to Chhauni to fly kites. Legend has it that if the line of the king’s kite was cut, it flew to Lhasa. But since anyone who caught that kite received five rupees, everyone attempted to catch that kite.”In 2021 news report ‘Bhawanle Chhekidiyo Changa Udaune Aakash’ by Shivahari Ghimire published in Nayapatrika, cultural expert the late Satyamohan Joshi also recounts that “During Dashain, Tribhuvan came to the ground below Swayambhu to fly kites. […] He did not use the same thread to fly kites twice.”In the same article, Joshi says that the King also went to Budhanilakantha to fly kites and participate in kite flying competitions.End of season, end of cultureMohan Krishna Shrestha, 86, was born in Budhanilakantha. Every year, on the day of Haribodhini Ekadashi, he saw the annual fair at the Budhanilakantha Temple. He also witnessed kite fliers gathered in the open fields around the Temple.“Oh, it’d be a lot of people,” says Shrestha. “They came from all around Bhaktapur, Kathmandu and Lalitpur.”They flew kites on Ekadashi, Dwadashi and some even until Purnima.“They took all the remaining threads and kites that had survived Dashain and flew the last kites of the season,” says Tuladhar. “I remember my uncles, relatives and neighbours going to Budhanilakantha with their kites.”Joshi recalls in the 2021 article that King Tribhuvan also went to Budhanilakantha with his sons Mahendra, Himalaya and Basundhara. He greatly supported and also participated in the competitions there organised by the commoners. If he liked he gave prize money to the winners.This annual event lost its glory days after the decline in the open fields as buildings began to rise with the establishment of Budhanilkantha School in 1972, Mohan says.“The event survived in some form until the 1990s,” he says.But what happened after that?The end-of-the-season event in the 1990s was also an indication of the end of the age-old kite tradition.“If I go to my ancestral place in Asan to fly kites, it’s not possible for me to do that today because there are buildings everywhere,” says Tuladhar. “Cityscapes and urbanisation have created the obstacle for flying kites.”Dibya does feel like flying kites sometimes.“No space to fly kites today,” he says. “In the old times, there were river banks and open fields. Even if you fly kites, it gets stuck in somebody's rooftop or water tank or somewhere.”Yesteryear’s kite enthusiasts believe that increasing means of entertainment was another reason for the decline of kite culture.“When television came, kite flying started to slowly decrease,” says Bibek. “And then mobile phones robbed kite flying even more.”And so, when his sister Sajani cranes her neck up in the sky today, she rarely sees a kite.“Those days we heard one chait after another,” she says. “These days you won’t hear a single chait.” \nIn 2008 Matina Shakya was only three years old when she was appointed as the Kumari of Kathmandu. She was succeeded by Trishna Shakya as the new Kumari in 2017.Kumaris are revered as goddesses of beauty and strength in certain Hindu and Buddhist traditions. Worshipping young girls as Kumaris is a 2,000-year-old practice in Nepal. Since the 13th century, when the Malla kings ruled, the Newars of the Kathmandu Valley have been worshipping Kumari, a girl from the Shakya/Bajracharya community chosen to embody the divine energy of goddess Taleju Bhawani. The reign of a Kumari ends when she starts menstruating. So long as she is serving as the Kumari, she is believed to be the nation’s divine protector, safeguarding it from evil. Matina, 18, is now in her first year of college, studying for a bachelor’s degree in management. Her father, Pratapman Shakya, when asked about having a daughter who is the only living the goddess in the world said, “Not having your own daughter live in the same house as you seemed a little unfair, but we feel very proud to call ourselves the parents of the royal Kumari who is revered by people all over the world.”On March 9, 2023, he, along with Matina, were getting ready for a special function held to honour all former Kumaris from across Nepal. “There are often events to honour Matina as she was the royal Kumari, but this one was dedicated to all former Kumaris from different areas. There are 129 living Kumaris in all,” he added. Besides Kathmandu, Kumari tradition is followed in Bhaktapur, Lalitpur, and Kirtipur, among other cities.According to him, this was the first time an event like this was organised and the Deputy Mayor of Kathmandu, Sunita Dangol, was also in attendance.Throughout the year, many people line up outside the ‘Kumari Ghar’ to get a chance to visit the Kumari and get her blessings. Many foreigners stand out in the yard to catch a glimpse of her. Nepali people believe that if a Kumari smiles at you, it is a bad omen.Everyday, a tutor visits the Kumari to help her continue with her education as she is not allowed to step outside the Kumari Ghar. She takes her exams and does her homework from the Kumari Ghar itself. She also has the freedom to play inside the Kumari Ghar. Many former kumaris have pursued careers in their fields of interest or studied after their term ends, and they continue to be treated with the same respect. The tradition of Kumari has evolved over time. In the past Kumaris did not enjoy these freedoms.Because of various superstitious beliefs, Kumaris were not fully educated and were forbidden from getting married because of the belief that the groom would die soon if he married an ex-Kumari. They led secluded lives, were restricted from participating in normal childhood activities, and focused solely on their religious duties.However, now, these myths have been dispelled. Modern understanding has shifted to recognise that Kumaris, after stepping down from their divine role, have the freedom to marry and lead a normal life. The perception of Kumaris as isolated figures has evolved, with a focus on providing them with a more balanced upbringing. There have been initiatives to integrate Kumaris into regular social and educational settings, allowing them to have a more holistic and fulfilling childhood experience. “Matina was already familiar with the students from the school that she attended after her term as Kumari ended,” said Shakya. “The kids visited the Kumari Ghar frequently so that she could have a smooth transition,” he added. According to Gautam Prasad Shakya, who has been living as a caretaker in the Kumari Ghar, the changes made to the tradition are minor. “The traditions of Kumari have mostly stayed the same. All the rituals are still practised like in the old days,” he said.On 6 May 2005, Pun Devi Maharjan, a lawyer, filed a case in the Supreme Court claiming that the traditional practice of electing young girls as Kumaris, or “goddesses’, who are expected to follow certain social restrictions and appear at religious festivals, violated the rights of the child. Quoting Maharjan’s complaint, Puskar Mathema writes in Yuwamanch Monthly of October 2007, “If Kumari tradition is continued, it will undermine the fundamental rights as well the freedoms of children guaranteed by the constitution and child rights treaties. Apart from this, it will have a negative impact on their physical and mental development.”The case continued while Nepal overthrew the monarchy and declared itself a secular state in 2007. When the judgement was pronounced in 2008, the goddess was still in her role, now giving blessings to the country’s President. The court ordered that the Kumaris and ex-Kumaris receive better benefits and arrangements and ordered the government to improve their support and allowances.In April 2006, Prof Chunda Bajracharya filed a petition at the Supreme Court against Maharjan’s petition, who had argued against the Kumari tradition. Bajracharya contended that the tradition should be preserved as heritage due to its over 100 years of history.“People who don’t understand the culture shouldn’t comment on it,” she stated. Bajracharya also criticised the human right activists who contended that Kumaris were only allowed to wear the colour red. “People who say Kumaris are forced to wear red clothing all the time, are the same people who send their kids to schools in uniform,” she said.“After the 2008 court verdict, there have been a lot of improvements. Now, a teacher visits the Kumari Ghar daily to tutor the Kumari, who is expected to complete school assignments and sit periodic exams. All the former Kumaris now get benefits like scholarships and special pensions,” she added.Bajracharya is currently a professor of literature at the Tribhuvan University in Kathmandu.“The only significant change that the court verdict brought to the tradition was in terms of her education,” said Gautam Prasad Shakya, the caretaker. “Kumaris were tutored long before the case, but the case helped formalise this arrangement. After the court verdict, the time between 12 pm and 4 pm was designated as the Kumari’s tuition time,” he added.After the verdict, there was a concerted effort to provide Kumaris with access to quality education, enabling them to develop the skills and knowledge needed to lead fulfilling lives beyond their divine roles. There was also a shift towards ensuring that the Kumari's living quarters are comfortable, safe, and conducive to her overall well-being.Moreover, the selection process for the Kumari underwent reforms in the aftermath of the Pun Devi Maharjan case. There was a push for greater transparency, accountability, and inclusivity in the selection of the Kumari, with an emphasis on ensuring that the process was fair, respectful, and free from undue influence.Efforts were made to support their transition into adulthood, including providing them with comprehensive resources for education, vocation, and social integration. This shift aimed to address the challenges faced by former Kumaris and empower them to lead independent and fulfilling lives after their divine service.“The Kumari tradition has evolved over time. During the tenure of my daughter, we saw a lot of improvements. Even after her time as Kumari, Matina continued to get a lot of government support,” said Shakya, former Kumari Matina’s father.“Some people argue that child rights are being violated, but all of her rights are being upheld inside the Kumari Ghar. This is a unique and respected aspect of Nepali culture, and I don’t believe it violates any of my child’s rights.”While the Kumari tradition continues, its practices have evolved. “She enjoys this normal life and it didn’t take her long to adjust as well,” says Matina’s father, on her transition from the revered Kumari to the ordinary Matina. \nWhat animals did Juddha Shumsher have in his zoo?“We only have records of animals from the mid-1960s,” says Ganesh Koirala, who has been employed at the Central Zoo for the past 36 years and currently serves as its information officer and programme officer. “That too I hand-copied from an old torn-down file that I came across.”Today, the Central Zoo, which sprawls across six hectares in Jawalakhel, Lalitpur, houses as many as 1,298 wild animals of different species of mammals, reptiles, fishes and birds from Nepal and around the world—from tiger, rhinoceros, hippopotamus and red panda to its recent attraction: a pair of chimpanzees.After enduring decades of neglect under various government bodies, with its animals and infrastructure scraping along in a deplorable state, the zoo received a new lease of life with improved infrastructure and animal care in 1995, when it came under the management of the King Mahendra Trust for Nature Conservation (KMTNC), now known as the National Trust for Nature Conservation, in 1995.Today, the Central Zoo is an entertainment venue, one of the most happening places in the Kathmandu valley. Flocked by thousands of daily visitors, the zoo now also hosts rescued animals and those in need of rehabilitation. It is also a site for conservation education.But when Juddha Shumsher Rana (prime minister from 1932–1945) built the Jawalakhel Zoological Garden on the premises of his Jawalakhel Durbar (where Nepal Administrative Staff College stands today) in 1932, he did so purely for private interests—as a space of entertainment and amusement for him and his family.Built in the semi-wilderness of Jawalakhel around a historical pond dating to the 17th century during the reign of King Siddhi Narsingh Malla, the zoo also became the space he could use to show his respect for two women he revered, his mother and sister-in-law, and indulge in one of his favourite pastimes—gambling.Today, the Central Zoo, nestled in the heart of Jawalakhel's sprawling crowd, does not go unnoticed, and its story is well told. But what passions drove Juddha to build the zoo? What was its original layout? What animals did it have in the beginning? And how did Juddha spend time there?“I remember once seeing a small board that read ‘Jawalakhel Zoological Garden’,” Koirala says. “I don’t know whether it was from Juddha’s time or was made in the later years. It must surely be that Juddha built the zoo out of influence from the British given how this term was used by them.”Koirala adds, “There is a former employee, now an elderly gentleman who worked in the zoo in the 1960s. He surely has some stories from Juddha’s time.”Birds, beasts and palacesTo trace the birth of Jawalakhel Zoological Garden, one has to look at the history of Nepal’s rulers owning birds and animals.Like rulers around the world, Nepal’s royalty kept wild and exotic birds and animals in captivity as a source of pleasure and mark of wealth and power. The book ‘Social History of Nepal’ by historians TR Vaidya, Tri Ratna Manandhar and Shankar Lal Joshi details how Mallas during the mediaeval Kathmandu Valley to Ranas and Shahs in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries owned rare, exotic creatures. In 1708, a rhinoceros in Kathmandu Valley broke the iron chain in which it was bound and killed its tamer. In 1714, Bhaktapur’s King Bhupatindra Malla gifted a camel and an elephant to Kantipur’s King Bhaskar Malla to build peace.Among Shahs, King Rana Bahadur Shah in particular was reputed for his collection of birds and animals. He also owned a zoo outside his palace in Basantapur Durbar Square, where the Nepal Bank Limited stands in New Road today. The zoo contained “tiger, bear, monkey, elephant, horse, deer… heron, peacock… pigeon, wild dogs, rabbits, rats, mongoose.”Jung Bahadur Rana’s zoo on the premises of his Thapathali Durbar hosted a variety of birds and animals collected during his hunting expeditions as well as those brought from abroad. Jung Bahadur himself used to “supervise and inspect it”. Juddha Shumsher likewise had his own collection of creatures which steadily expanded into a zoological garden. Seeking wilderness in his Jawalakhel DurbarJuddha’s biographer Ishwari Prasad writes in ‘The Life and Times of Maharaja Juddha Shumsher Jung Bahadur Rana’ that between 1933 and 1940, Juddha shot 433 tigers, 33 rhinoceros and 93 leopards. An insatiable big-game hunter, Juddha had a deep fondness for being in the wild and among wild animals, and from this came, according to oral history prevalent among members of Kathmandu’s Rana community including Juddha’s descendants, the desire to own a zoo.Built in 1752, Schönbrunn Zoo in Vienna, the world’s first modern zoo, was already over 100 years old when Juddha was born in 1875. London Zoo opened in 1828 and Alipore Zoological Garden (Kolkata Zoo) in 1875. Nawab Wajid Ali Shah Zoological Garden (Lucknow Zoo) was established in 1921. Juddha’s inspiration, his descendants say, was most likely reinforced by his tours to zoological gardens during his visits to England in 1908 and to different Indian cities.An article titled ‘Central zoo in state of neglect’ published in The Kathmandu Post in 1996 says that Juddha one day “received a pair of leopards as a gift”, cementing his desire to own a zoo. A report ‘Central Zoo Master Plan’ prepared by the KMTNC in 1996 says that Juddha decided to build a zoo in an epiphany when he saw that some animals “including deer, a few rhinos, and some tigers had been collected from the Tarai and kept in Kathmandu” could be put into one compound in the “lonely piece of land with a large 16th [sic] century Malla period Pokhari”.The pond lay still and serene surrounded by green wilderness ever since Patan’s King Siddhi Narsingh Malla built it in the 1600s. On the grounds surrounding this pond, the Newars from Na:Tole, Pulchowk and surroundings had their devisthans where, for centuries, they gathered to perform their religious ceremonies during Basanta Panchami and Bhoto Jatra even after this area fell within the Jawalakhel Durbar.For the palace, the ground served as its extended garden along with a horse and elephant stable. Subodh Rana, 69, grandson of Juddha Shumsher, recalled his father Kiran Shumsher telling him that Juddha and his family sometimes also used the scenic grounds for picnics. If there was any spot where Juddha wanted to build a menagerie, it would be around this Pokhari (pond). One day, he called his grandson General Maheshwar Shumsher Rana and deputed him to the task of doing just this.The zoo’s layout—except for the small plots of lands acquired later—that was in place when it came under KMTNC's management was, the present and retired zoo officials believe, mostly the same as it was built by Maheshwar and so offers a peek into how Juddha’s zoo must have been like. Pond in the middle of the ground surrounded by enclosures—the southern bank housing mainly larger animals, and cages for birds positioned on the northern banks.From pigeons to the king of the jungleWhat animals and birds did the enclosures at Juddha’s zoo house?“We cannot tell for sure,” Koirala says.Once it came under government ownership, the zoo was tossed from one institution to the other for lack of interest and knowledge on the right institution to manage it. Amid all this chaos, documents were possibly lost and the zoo has no concrete record about the animals that Juddha must have once taken amusement at, said Koirala.Mukti Narayan Shrestha, 82, a retired secretary of the Nepal government, joined the Central Zoo in 1970 as a veterinarian when many original structures of the zoo were still intact. Shrestha also worked with an elderly khardar who, he says, was employed in the zoo since the time of Juddha and was about to retire when he joined.“In those days where the purpose of menageries was exclusively for exhibition and pleasure with no regard for the welfare and recreation of animals and birds, the cages were tiny and iron-barred,” Shrestha says.Elephant, horses, deer, monkeys, tiger, rhinoceros, clouded leopard, red panda, bear, palm civet (nir biralo), four-horned antelope, Himalayan goral, pheasants, Himalayan monal—from the mythical and the majestic, the gentle and friendly to the fiery and ferocious, Juddha’s zoo boasted them all, Shrestha says.Shrestha’s account is not different from the anecdotes passed down to other retired and present zoo officials and the members of the Rana community, who also detail the rare and the exotic fauna, like the gharial crocodile and porcupine, even the jungle’s king—creatures, they say, that Juddha must have received from foreigners as gifts—appearing alongside domestic birds like pigeons.Tidbits of published information also confirm that the zoo had a good collection of exotic birds and animals from Nepal and abroad. One such suggestion comes from Kalyan Shumsher’s ‘Shree Teen Juddha Mahima’ published during Juddha’s reign in 1943.“One need not travel abroad to see the incredible birds and animals found in foreign countries,” he writes. “It will suffice to see [those creatures] right here in the zoo opened by His Holiness Shree 3 [Juddha] in Jawalakhel.”Among these incredible creatures, one reigned supreme—lion, the king of the jungle.For one, it would not have satiated Juddha to build a zoo and not have the jungle’s king exhibited in it. Juddha hence must have done everything possible to ensure one for the zoo. Infrastructure at the zoo suggests that the lion indeed lived at Juddha’s zoo or, in the least, during the Rana regime.“Where bear habitat lies today, there were two dome-shaped attached enclosures with a holding room, constructed in the classic architecture that many enclosures in the British zoos had in the past. They had brick walls and lime plaster,” Koirala says. “These were built to house a lion in one cage and a tiger in the other.”Near these enclosures stood another cage that remains intact today, with the head of a roaring lion carved out of the wall on the top of its iron bars. Zoo officials as well as members of the Rana community believe that Juddha had this exhibit built to specifically house a lion.Remarkably, these Juddha-era infrastructural spaces are corroborated by a rare piece of photographic evidence. A 1946 photo of the zoo shows a lion while a Kathmandu mother and her sons stand in front of its cage.Juddha’s place of piety and playThe zoo was not merely a space that Juddha sought out for amusement and retreat in the outpost of his palace; he also used this place to express his deepest affection.This affection spills right at the zoo’s entrance, in the form of the life-size statue of Karma Kumari Devi, wife of Juddha’s elder brother and Rana Prime Minister Dev Shumsher. Karma Kumari stands tall in her regal costume shaded by a wide canopy. Juddha revered Karma Kumari because it was she who raised him and looked after his mother Juhar Kumari Devi after the death of his father Dhir Shumsher. On another prominent part of the zoo on the south-east, Juhar Kumari’s enthroned statue overlooks the pond. Juddha had commissioned the London-based sculptor Domenico Antonio Tonelli to cast these statues.When Karma Kumari’s statue was unveiled is not clear, but Juhar Kumari’s statue was unveiled by Juddha amid a grand function in 1935 on Jawalakhel’s most auspicious day, Bhoto Jatra. It was attended by the British Resident Frederick Bailey.“On June 28, 1935, at Jawalakhel Durbar… the pond nearby looked very scenic,” says a Gorkhapatra news report titled ‘Statue installation’ dated July 5, 1935. “Because it was the day of Bhoto Jatra of Machhindranath… and moreover since an ideal woman’s statue was being unveiled, there was a crowd of lakhs of people.”Less than fifty metres from Karma Kumari’s statue stands a one-story building with a pagoda roof that today serves as the zoo’s meeting hall. Juddha, an avid gambler, found the scenic semi-wilderness covered in trees and filled with the sounds of wildlife to be a perfect place to relish the game. So he built a building with twelve doors on its four sides allowing him and his fellow gambling compatriots the freedom to enter through a particular door that they thought would bring luck. He called it his Juwa Ghar, the gambling house, and built it with the sole purpose of indulging in the game he loved. Roar of lion reverberates in KathmanduThe sounds of the animals and birds in the zoo rose up in the Jawalakhel sky. Every day, until much later in the 1970s, roar of the zoo’s lion (there were later other lions) diffused to far corners of the Valley, merging the zoo with the spirit of Kathmandu and informing the city folks of its presence.But was the zoo open to the public as well?“I think once it was built, the zoo was open for the public,” Subodh Rana said. “It is unlikely that Juddha Shumsher built such a large zoo and kept it only for his family.”For one, Kalyan Shumsher mentioning that one “need not travel abroad to see the incredible birds and animals found in foreign countries” suggests that the public had at least some access to the zoo. Of course, the Newar community from Na:Tole, Pulchowk and surrounding areas were permitted inside the zoo on the days of their guthi functions on Basanta Panchami and Bhoto Jatra.As the zoo was established at the back of the ground where Bhoto Jatra celebrations happen, it naturally filled with revellers on this day in addition to the guthi ritual observers as testified by the Gorkhapatra report. The photo of the mother and her sons also bear testimony that the zoo was not entirely closed to the public.What is widely believed, though, is that the zoo officially came under government ownership after Nepal became a democracy in 1951. And it would still be a few more years before it was open to the public in 1956.In 1945, Juddha gave up his power and eventually retired in Dehradun, India, where he died in 1952. With time, Jawalakhel Zoological Garden became the Central Zoo. It would take many avatars—a neglected site of crammed, unmaintained cages with sad eyes of emaciated creatures staring from behind the bars, a focal point of animal diplomacy, particularly during the period of monarchy, to, in its recent decades, a space of conservation and education.When all this was happening, the city sprawled around Jawalakhel, subduing the lion’s roar with its noise. More wildlife from around the country and the world came—creatures captured from the wild, those sold by circuses, those rescued from traffickers. Fate would bring these creatures to the care of generations of Kathmandu folks, intertwining each other’s joys and sorrows. After the tale of Juddha’s Jawalakhel Zoological Garden, there would be these stories to tell. Sitting around a table inside Juddha’s Juwa Ghar, Koirala and other zoo officials begin unfolding these stories before me. \nOn November 8, 2024, the Maoist Chair and former Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal, while addressing a public gathering of his party members in Kathmandu, attacked his opponents as kujat (lowly caste). He further added that his social intercourse with the parties in power had rendered him and his party maila dhaila (unclean, impure, filthy). Of course, Dahal was rebuking his political rivals and not directly discriminating against Dalits. Yet, a top leader’s use of derogatory casteist slurs was deeply offensive. These terms have long been commonly used to dominate, humiliate, ridicule, exclude and demean Dalits in everyday life. Our campaign group, the Caste Watch Network, has been raising its voice against this offence and demanding a public apology from him. I’ve spoken on some YouTube channels and written an article in Setopati online. We may as well hit the street for our dignity. However, there’s been no outrage in the Dalit community. When I mentioned this to some noted Dalit parliamentarians, activists and intellectuals, they just shrugged it off; they didn’t even dare to protest on their social media platforms! Why apologise? Dahal must publicly recognise his mistake—intentional or otherwise—and seek an apology from the Dalit community. He can’t just make excuses. Here are some of the reasons for this.First, his deployment of the casteist terms has deeply hurt Dalits. Their inability to speak out notwithstanding, most Dalits do feel humiliated, not least at the hands of the leader of a major party. If he were not powerful, Dalits would almost certainly have protested vociferously on social media and the streets.In March 2019, a popular folk singer and the then Member of Parliament Komal Oli infuriated Dalits by using a casteist proverb—“let a dum become the king after my death” (dum being a highly derogatory term)—in one of her TV interviews. Dalits raised their voices, mainly on social media, and she was forced to formally apologise in Parliament.Second, Dahal’s derogatory expression is illegal. He can be challenged in a court of law for crimes related to caste discrimination and hate speech. His power and influence will likely prevent a criminal investigation, but as the lawyers tell me, the case can still be taken to court. More importantly, Dahal should apologise to Dalits for the sake of his political future. Dalit community is one of his pedestals, and he cannot afford to be alienated at a time of his rapidly declining popularity.Many Dalits are still grateful to the Maoist party for its contribution to terminating the Hindu monarchy and establishing a system of proportional representation, including, for example, a Dalit woman in each ward office. They are grateful to him for giving them some power and confidence to fight against caste hierarchy.They particularly remember his attempts to directly act against caste discrimination in many villages during the “People’s War’’. Dalits believe the armed struggle undoubtedly made the practice of caste discrimination less severe—even though the problem has rebounded since the end of the armed conflict. However, Dalits have become somewhat confused and frustrated with Dahal and his party in recent years. During his three tenures as prime minister, he didn’t make any tangible effort to enforce anti-caste laws nor offer any powerful ministerial position to Dalits. Nor did he appoint any Dalit to an influential position in a state body.So, it’s time for Dahal and his party to retain and revive the great support of the marginalised groups, including Dalits. Apologising to Dalits (perhaps unwittingly) for uttering anti-Dalit statements would help increase his popularity within the community. Dalit servitude exposed The lack of Dalit response to Dahal’s casteist slurs has exposed the degree of their servitude to the upper castes, especially powerful leaders. It shows Dalits’ mental slavery. Why do Dalits lack self-strength and self-confidence? This is an essential reflexive question for Dalit activists themselves. There are many reasons for Dalits' inability to defend their dignity. One major drawback is the absence of an independent Dalit struggle. There is no Dalit ideology and philosophy other than those spoon-fed by upper-caste leaders. Unlike in India, Nepali Dalit activists and their organisations are connected to one party or another, and a handful of parties control all resources and opportunities. Given the circumstances, a Dalit activist, politician, or intellectual not affiliated with a political party is rare. Dalits would thus be fearful of the high-caste men and women in power. Even those Dalits who are not politically active live in fear of the party leaders. For one thing, it seems impossible to get anything done without the support of the parties. Finding employment, opening and running a business or NGO and the rest would be difficult without the backing of a powerful party. Lives and properties aren’t considered safe in our country unless parties provide protection. Further, the parties heavily influence the courts and law enforcement so much that whenever a person is arrested for any alleged crime, the first thing the investigating officers ask is the party the suspect belongs to! And parties often protect their cadres even when they’ve committed heinous crimes like rape and murder.Of course, these are the common issues people of all castes in Nepal face. But the marginalised sections of society are naturally more vulnerable and need to take extra measures not to offend or upset anybody in power, let alone those at the top of the food chain.I believe the biggest problem with Dalits’ inability to fight back is their mental slavery—which I call jadaubad. Jadau is a traditional salutation by the lower castes to the upper castes, showing their deference and obedience to the masters. Dalits were required to bow before the high castes and utter jadau malik (greetings, master)! In today’s democratic republic, Dalits aren’t obligated to show this degree of deference to the upper castes. Nor are Dalits as powerless, intimidated and impoverished as during the Rana and Panchayat regimes. Their economic and social positions are gradually rising. Yet, Dalits haven’t given up their habit of showing excessive respect to the higher castes, especially towards influential leaders.Breaking this long and feudal habit of displaying excessive deference to the leaders—jadaubad—is a prerequisite for freeing Dalit minds and bringing forth new ideologies and strategies and thus raising a Dalit liberation struggle free from the control of the high-caste party leaders. We should start with at least some of us being brave enough to fight against leaders like Dahal when they hurt our dignity and self-worth.  \nThe petroleum-laden dust has settled on this year’s United Nations climate summit, COP29, held over the past fortnight in Baku, Azerbaijan. Climate scientists, leaders, lobbyists and delegates are heading for home. The meeting achieved incremental progress. Negotiators agreed on a new climate finance target of at least $300 billion a year by 2035 (A$460 billion), up from $100 billion now. These funds would help developing nations shift away from fossil fuels, adapt to the warming climate and respond to loss and damage from climate disasters.Nations also agreed on the essential rules for a global carbon trading market, the last agreement needed to make the 2015 Paris Agreement fully operational. As UN climate chief Simon Stiell said in the final session, the 29th Conference of the Parties (COP29) meeting showed the Paris Agreement was delivering on climate action, but national governments “still need to pick up the pace”.I attended COP29 as an expert in international climate law and litigation. I observed the finance negotiations firsthand and represented a new alliance of Australian and Pacific universities supporting international climate cooperation. At the outset, expectations for the conference were low. The United States had just voted for the return of climate denier Donald Trump. And Azerbaijan President Ilham Aliyev declared oil and gas a “gift of God” at an opening event. But even with these considerable headwinds, progress was made.Progress on climate financeThe world’s rich countries currently contribute $100 billion a year to climate finance for developing nations. It pays for measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and adapt to climate change by making systems more resilient. Two years ago, countries agreed to create a new “loss and damage” fund for nations dealing with climate disasters, launched at the summit in Dubai last year. At these COP29 talks, Australia announced it would contribute A$50 million ($32 million) to this fund. Climate change is already costing developing countries huge sums, estimated at $100-$500 billion a year.These flows of funding from rich countries are essential for developing nations to increase their emissions reduction, as well as respond to climate damage. The COP29 deal sets a target of at least $300 billion per year by 2035, with richer countries leading delivery. While this goal represents a tripling of the previous target, it falls far short of the $400-$900 billion many developing countries had called for in finance from rich governments. Disappointed developing country representatives labelled it “a paltry sum” and a “joke”. It also falls short of what experts say is needed by 2035 to meet global climate finance needs. Recognising this gap, the text calls on “all actors to work together” to scale up finance from all public and private sources to at least $1.3 trillion per year by 2035. Ways this might be achieved will be presented at COP30 in Belém, Brazil, a year from now.Making the international carbon market a realityCOP29 also reached an agreement that settles longstanding disputes about making the international carbon market a reality. This hard-won deal delivered global standards for carbon trading, opening up new ways for developing countries to boost their renewable energy capacity. These rules will pave the way for country-to-country trading of carbon credits. Each credit represents a tonne of carbon dioxide either removed from the atmosphere or not emitted. The deal will give countries more flexibility in how they meet their emissions targets.It’s not perfect. Concerns linger on whether the rules will ensure trades reflect real projects and how transparent and accountable the market will be. But the agreement will boost the importance of carbon credits and could increase incentives to protect carbon “sinks”—such as rainforests, seagrass meadows and mangroves—with flow-on nature benefits.New national climate goalsBy February 2025, all 195 Paris signatories have to announce more ambitious emission targets. Some countries announced their new plans at COP29. The most ambitious was the United Kingdom, which upped its 2030 goal of a 68 percent cut to reducing 81percent below 1990 emissions by 2035. Next year’s host, Brazil, released new targets for a 59–67 percent drop below 2005 levels by 2035. But Brazil didn’t amend its 2030 ambitions and plans to boost oil and gas production 36 percent by 2035.The United Arab Emirates announced target cuts of 47 percent before 2035, ahead of net zero by 2050. But this pledge was criticised by climate campaigners because the UAE is projected to boost oil and gas production 34 percent by by 2035. The host, Azerbaijan, did not release its goals. Many other countries, including Australia, also held off from announcing new targets in Baku.Indecision on fossil fuelsFossil fuels were the elephant in the room. At last year’s COP in Dubai, nations finally agreed to include wording on, “transitioning away from fossil fuels in energy systems, in a just, orderly and equitable manner, accelerating action in this critical decade, so as to achieve net zero by 2050 in keeping with the science.” But at this year’s COP, there was no decision on how, exactly, to begin this transition—and fossil fuels are not explicitly mentioned in the outcome documents. Delegates from oil giant Saudi Arabia repeatedly tried to block mention of fossil fuels across all of the negotiating streams.Trump’s return wasn’t a deal-breakerThe consequences of Trump’s re-election for climate action were much discussed. But I observed a surprising amount of acceptance and even optimism for climate cooperation. The US is the world’s second-largest emitter, after China. Trump has promised to ramp up the country’s oil and gas production, and pull the US from the Paris Agreement as he did during his first term. But climate action continued regardless—especially in renewables giant China, which hit its 2030 renewable target this year. The US is no longer the main player in climate negotiations, and many countries are much further down the road of cutting emissions. Few show signs of backtracking.As the US bows out, it creates a vacuum. At COP29, middle powers such as Canada, the UK and Australia stepped up. Negotiators from a progressive High Ambition Coalition—including small island states, the European Union and Latin American countries such as Colombia—played an important role in pushing to urgently increase finance for climate action. China, for its part, is clearly eyeing off the position of climate leader about to be vacated by the US. And leaders of progressive US states attended COP29 to show parts of the US are still on board with climate action.Australia’s hosting bid for 2026 talks in limboAustralia’s bid to host COP31 in 2026 alongside Pacific nations was tipped to win, given it had the support from nearly all of the 29 “Western European and Other States” group of nations which will decide the host this time. Many observers expected an announcement at the end of COP29. But no decision was made, as the rival bidder, Türkiye, did not withdraw its bid. An announcement is now likely in mid-2025—after Australia’s next federal election.What now?Many people are disappointed by COP29. It did not bring transformative change. The huge jump in climate finance called for by developing countries, and many in civil society, didn’t eventuate. It came as 2024 is on track to be the hottest on record, and the costs of extreme weather have risen to more than $2 trillion over the last decade. But this year’s talks were still a step forward, affirming international climate cooperation at a time of significant geopolitical tensions globally. As the UN’s Simon Stiell said, “the UN Paris Agreement is humanity’s life-raft; there is nothing else […] We are taking that journey forward together.”—The ConversationRead the original article here. \nSanatana Dharma, often described as the “eternal religion,” serves as a foundational element of Hindu spirituality, encompassing a timeless set of duties and practices transcending societal divisions such as class, caste and sect. With its principles deeply rooted in harmony with nature, sustainability and collective well-being, Sanatana Dharma aligns with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Exploring its rituals and philosophies reveals valuable insights for contemporary sustainable living, offering guidance for addressing modern global challenges.Sanatana Dharma and SDGsSanatana Dharma’s alignment with the SDGs is evident in various practices and traditions. Recently observed festivals like Chhath, Diwali (known as Tihar in Nepal), Makar Sankranti and Navratri embody sustainability through rituals such as cleaning riverbanks, using biodegradable oil lamps and revering nature. These practices reflect the ethos of SDG 12, which promotes responsible consumption and production while fostering environmental awareness and community collaboration. Similarly, the concept of dāna (charity) addresses SDG 1 (No poverty) and SDG 2 (Zero hunger) by encouraging wealth redistribution through food donations and other forms of giving, helping bridge social inequities. The concept of dāna (charity), particularly anna dāna (food donation), holds significant importance, with numerous festivals mandating acts of giving such as moksha dhenu dāna (cow donation for liberation), vastra dāna (clothing donation) and sejiya dāna (bedding donation). These practices encourage those with resources to support the underprivileged, thereby addressing issues of hunger and poverty.The focus on Ayurveda, yoga and meditation in Sanatana Dharma aligns with SDG 3 (Good Health and Well-being) by emphasising preventive health care. Additionally, the traditional Gurukul education system, which integrated ethics and self-awareness, mirrors SDG 4 (Quality Education). Gender equality is celebrated through the veneration of female deities such as Durga, Saraswati and Lakshmi, aligning with SDG 5. Ancient texts, such as RigVed, underscore women's intellectual and spiritual achievements during the Vedic period. While historical and cultural interpretations may differ, the fundamental teachings of Sanatana Dharma advocate for respect and equality between genders. Hindu scriptures and rituals frequently recognise and honour the diversity of gender identities, including the tritiya prakriti (third gender), which encompasses transgender individuals.SDG Goal 6 emphasises Clean Water and Sanitation, while SDG 14 focuses on life below water. Sanatana Dharma’s reverence for rivers such as the Bagmati, Bishnumati, Ganga, Yamuna, Cauvery, Narmada, Sindhu, Godavari, Brahmaputra and Tapti, along with water-centric rituals, highlight principles of water conservation and cleanliness. Many of these rituals explicitly discourage water pollution. Similarly, SDG 7, which advocates for Affordable and Clean Energy, aligns with the reliance on natural resources in Sanatana Dharma's rituals, supporting renewable and sustainable energy use. SDG 8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth) and SDG 10 (Reduced Inequalities) find parallels in the principles of karma yoga (duty-driven work) and the ethical pursuit of artha (prosperity) in Sanatana Dharma, promoting fair and purposeful economic practices. Traditionally, households in Nepal and India adhered to minimalistic and resourceful lifestyles, buying necessities, avoiding unnecessary borrowing and finding ways to reuse items—for example, passing down clothes from older to younger siblings.Additionally, acts of charity to support the poor and needy were widely practised. SDG 13, which focuses on climate action, resonates with Sanatana Dharma through practices like tree worship, seasonal festivals and honouring natural cycles, all representing a commitment to environmental conservation. Likewise, SDG 15, centred on Life on Land, aligns with the Dharma’s respect for all living beings and the environment. This is evident in rituals and teachings emphasising forests, animals and biodiversity protection.Modern practices and environmental degradationDespite the sustainability principles deeply embedded in Sanatana Dharma, cities in India and Nepal often face severe environmental challenges. Many urban areas appear polluted and unclean, with major rivers suffering from contamination. In India, post-Diwali celebrations frequently lead to smog and a rise in air quality index (AQI) levels. Numerous Sanatana Dharma festivals are now associated with different types of pollution: Holi contributes to water pollution, Chhath impacts river cleanliness, Kanwar Yatra and Durga Puja generate noise pollution and Diwali is linked to air pollution. These issues highlight a stark contrast between the sustainable ethos of Sanatana Dharma and the current environmental reality, with alarming pollution levels, inadequate urban waste management and overexploitation of natural resources.Identifying the disconnectThere is a noticeable disconnect between tradition and modernity. The commercialisation of rituals has led to practices that deviate significantly from their original sustainable intent. For example, using non-biodegradable materials during festivals undermines their environmentally conscious foundations. Moreover, rapid urbanisation and population growth have put immense pressure on natural resources, making it increasingly difficult to uphold traditional sustainable practices. Lastly, a lack of awareness about the ecological wisdom inherent in these customs has led to their neglect or misinterpretation.Sanatana Dharma offers a strong grounding and philosophical framework to holistically address the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Its emphasis on interconnectedness, non-violence (ahimsa) and reverence for nature aligns naturally with global sustainability objectives. However, realising its full potential requires deliberate efforts to adapt and modernise rituals while preserving their essence. As the birthplace of Sanatana Dharma, Nepal and India are uniquely positioned to lead by example. By bridging the gap between its traditional teachings and contemporary needs, they can inspire their populations—and the world—to embrace a lifestyle that harmonises with the planet. Aligning modern practices with the enduring values of Sanatana Dharma can pave the way for progress toward achieving the SDGs while safeguarding a rich and timeless legacy.The path aheadRevisiting traditional wisdom is essential for the future. By reinterpreting rituals through sustainability, their relevance can be revitalised. For example, promoting eco-friendly festival practices like using clay oil lamps (diyo) and natural rangoli colours, avoiding fireworks and opting for locally sourced organic food reflects a commitment to sustainability. Additionally, education and awareness initiatives are essential. Integrating the principles of Sanatana Dharma into the educational curriculum that is not just confined to the environment but also business and other cross-cutting disciplines at the undergraduate and graduate level in universities can foster respect for nature and cultivate a sense of responsibility in younger generations. Such a curriculum can be integrated at the school level as well. Community-driven efforts are also vital. Encouraging projects like river clean-up campaigns, inspired by river worship traditions, can have a lasting impact on the environment. Policy support is another critical aspect. Governments should integrate these practices into policies to encourage adoption by offering incentives for eco-friendly approaches. \nPrime Minister and CPN-UML chair KP Sharma Oli likes to project an image of a decisive leader. This much-valued leadership trait often works to his advantage. Yet when he makes decisions on the fly, it can backfire just as often. This past Friday, the UML held a mass gathering in the national capital in order to “raise awareness against anarchy”. Many found it curious that the party leading the national government would call for such a gathering: Shouldn’t the prime minister be focusing on delivery and leave all the protests and rallies to opposition forces? The real reason behind the rally, as party insiders put it, was the UML’s desire to “project strength” at a time of widespread public disenchantment. The rally and the eventual gathering at Durbar Marg, it was hoped, would send an unmistakable signal to other political forces that the party is still a potent force capable of mobilising big masses at short notice. Such a show of strength had apparently become vital after much smaller forces like the Rastriya Swatantra Party and even some troublemakers associated with Durga Prasai were seen hitting the streets in order to “sow anarchy”. The Friday event turned out to be dud. The party had expected at least 100,000 to turn up; the actual crowd was much smaller. In any case, Oli and other top UML leaders who addressed the Durbar Marg gathering had little of substance to say. For instance, the prime minister spent considerable time denouncing the RSP chair Rabi Lamichhane and his supposedly dubious character. This was rum as Lamichhane is currently in police custody and facing a series of criminal charges. Moreover, the RSP protests against Lamichhane’s arrest have already fizzled out. So, instead of promising no government intervention on investigations against Lamichhane and others arrested on charges of cooperatives fraud, why continue to hound a jailed and much-diminished political opponent? Whatever Oli’s intent, it betrayed a deep sense of insecurity vis-a-vis Lamichhane and even the smallest forces that have criticised his government leadership. This wasn’t a display of strength, either from Oli or the UML. It was rather an inadvertent show of weakness which the party’s political opponents will greatly relish. Any way you look at it, the gathering, organised on a weekday and at great inconvenience for commuters, was unnecessary, nay, a nuisance. Again, it is hard to read Oli, and perhaps whatever purpose he had in mind has been served. But most folks are left scratching their heads. The head of government, instead of governing and trying to silence his critics through delivery, is seen spewing venom against his political opponents at a rally that seemingly no one except him wanted. There is also a sense of unease among the people. Our prime minister and his party seem incapable of taking criticism and if someone raises a question, they will try to shout down the questioner. Ironically, the protest against anarchy itself turned out to be rather anarchic: Lacking a purpose, horribly organised and disturbing people’s daily lives.  \nThe line between fake content and free speech online is razor-thin. A recent case in point is controversial businessman Durga Prasai’s accusation against Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli. Prasai, taking to social media, alleged that the Nepali premier had invested Rs32.5 billion in a telecom company in Cambodia. The police determined that the documents he presented were clear fakes, as Oli’s signature was forged and even his name presented in some documents as ‘evidence’ was incorrect. As a result, following an order from the Kathmandu District Court, Prasai was arrested on Tuesday.The constitution of Nepal upholds free speech and the freedom to broadcast audiovisual content, but these rights should be exercised without harming anyone. People like Prasai have repeatedly weaponised social media platforms to settle personal scores or to promote political agenda. Even though social media and the internet at large have been pivotal in promoting free speech, their roles in driving fake news and mis/disinformation have gone out of hand. In recent times, deepfakes like audio recordings and video clips can easily mimic someone else’s identity using artificial intelligence, with the intent of sullying people’s reputation and spreading false information. Only in September, the editor and the publisher of an online portal, sidhakura.com, were arrested for circulating a series of malicious audio-video content targeting some prominent members of the society. Countries around the world are concerned about the rise of mis/disinformation online and are working to make such tools ethical with the help of wide civic engagement, discussions and technical consultations. Nepal, on the other hand, has taken an opposite approach. It has introduced a controversial Social Media Bill that violates international human rights norms and tramples on Nepal’s constitutional rights. This ham-fisted attempt to regulate social media platforms, many argue, will undermine free speech if implemented in its current form. The bill is rightly criticised for being brought without broad consultations. Moreover, Section 3 of the bill provides for a Social Media Management Council led by the Minister for Communication and Information Technology—a political position. According to Media Action Nepal’s analysis of the bill, such a council lacks members of civil society organisations and other bodies working to promote free speech and to fight misinformation. When regulatory provisions are not transparent, they cannot work for common good. Without broad consultations and deliberations, such legislation risks becoming a tool for political control rather than a means to protect democracy. Individuals like Prasai indeed demonstrate the dangers of unregulated digital platforms, but knee-jerk bills like the current Social Media Bill also risk undermining free speech.Nepal must address the challenges brought about by technological advancement with care. Blindly blocking social media sites, as was done with TikTok, is not the way to go about it. Our approach to tackling misinformation and fake content must balance the protection of free speech with the need for wise and workable social media regulation, even if it takes some time. Engaging civil society, media organisations and tech experts is essential to create ethical and effective solutions. Part of the focus should also be on digital literacy, sensitising the public on the consequences of malintent content, and promoting fact-checking mechanisms. The Durga Prasai case highlights the need for wise social media regulation; but this process must begin with broadest possible consultations.  \nThe inauguration of an immigration office at Korala border point in Upper Mustang’s Lo Manthang on October 30 had given a message of improved connectivity with the northern neighbour. But the excitement didn’t last as the office, opened with fanfare, was closed without delivering service for a single day. While unveiling the commemorative plaque, Home Minister Ramesh Lekhak was flanked by a group of high profile officials. Gandaki Province Chief Minister Surendra Raj Pandey, heads of three security agencies, director general of the immigration department, among others, landed at Lo Manthang to attend the function. No sooner had the VIPs returned to Kathmandu, other officials deployed there also decamped as Tihar festival began the next day. But they didn’t go back even after the end of the festivities citing the biting cold of the high mountain. Nepal has kept the border facility closed since the inauguration citing severe cold. This is a lame excuse. The weather didn’t suddenly turn cold there, nor has the situation on the ground worsened due to a natural disaster or other unforeseen events. Everyone knew that Korala border point, which is situated at an altitude of 4,650 metres, would witness a freezing cold in the winter. The authorities should have prepared before the inauguration. By contrast, the offices on the Chinese side are operating just fine.Bringing the immigration and other offices into operation at Lo Manthang is important as the Korala border point not only connects Nepal and China but also has a potential to be a trilateral trade junction between Nepal, India and China. Nepal has been building the Kaligandaki Corridor national pride project that connects the Siddhartha Highway in the south to Korala in the north. When the road is complete, the route from Nepal-India border point at Sunauli to Nepal-China border point at Korala through Siddhartha Highway and Kaligandaki corridor can be an alternative trilateral trade route linking the three countries. While important religious destinations such as Lumbini and Muktinath are on the route, it also connects Nepal’s important cities including Pokhara and Chitwan.Failure to bring this border point into operation has multiple effects. First, it undermines the route’s huge potential. Second, it leaves a bad impression on the Chinese. Indian, Chinese, and other countries that have been supporting us have a serious concern about Nepal’s negligence in development works. We sign agreements or inaugurate projects with a lot of noise, but don’t work on their maintenance or sustainability.Closure of Korala immigration is a case in point. Several projects started with Indian support have met with similar fate. India’s railway company constructed the Kurta-Bijalpura rail section and handed over the rail line to the Nepal Railway Company Limited last year. It has since been helping operate the train as Nepal is still to train its own staff to run the train.As Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli works on a wish list to be presented before Chinese leaders during his Beijing visit in the first week of December, such failure in bilateral initiatives weaken Nepal’s position. When Nepal seeks other countries’ support in its development endeavours, it must at least be ready to shoulder its share of responsibility. India and China have shown ability in infrastructure development, both at home and abroad. By failing to do even the bare minimum to take them into confidence, Nepal is severely undercutting its development prospects.  \nFormer Indian chief election commissioner SY Quraishi is a strong advocate of credible elections and inclusive democracy. He has extensively spoken and written on how increasing flow of money in elections is taking away the level playing field for candidates from different backgrounds. During his recent visit to Kathmandu, Binod Ghimire of the Post and Suresh Raj Neupane and Rajesh Mishra of Kantipur talked to him on a range of issues from electoral reforms, challenges in maintaining election sanctity in the age of generative artificial intelligence, to why the world is swinging right. Excerpts:Elections and democracy are intertwined. However, recent election results the world over are being seen as a threat to law and democracy. How do you see this phenomenon?Democracy and elections are two sides of the same coin. Without elections, there is no democracy. And worldwide, for the past 10 years, there is a swing towards the right, even in the US. In India, of course, we have been on the right for the past 10 years and our prime minister got a third term, though with a bit of reduced majority.The other thing is that in the past 10-12 years, there has been a debate on whether democracy is on a decline worldwide. The fact is that several indices of democracy indicate the decline. But people’s will cannot be taken as a threat to democracy. Sometimes they go to the left, sometimes, they move to the right. We cannot call it a threat to democracy. The democracy indices which I mentioned have a different classification.First, there are full democracies. Then there are flawed democracies. Third is hybrid democracies. The fourth is an authoritarian regime. So even in South Asia, we have one or two countries which are authoritarian, like Afghanistan and Pakistan. Their ranking keeps going up or down depending on the electoral and democratic performance. In India, the right-wing is ruling, but they lost some majority. They are now depending on two other parties, which are not considered right-wing. Of course, Trump got an absolute majority this time winning both popular vote and electoral votes. He also won both the houses. So, this is what can make him dictatorial. As it is, he is mercurial, and everybody is speculating how he is going to behave. Let’s wait and see.We can agree that people cannot be taken as a threat to democracy. But can we say that the elections, rather than complementing the spirit of democracy, are turning into tools to endorse majoritarianism?Well, people’s will is supreme. If they have chosen absolute governments, if they have given large majorities, you cannot blame the people. Many times a lot of money is being used in elections, and only the rich people get to win elections. In India, for instance, 93 percent of MPs who got elected are crorepatis [multi-millionaires]. Now, law provides for a ceiling on expenditure, so that level playing field is established, where you and I can also contest.But then, the ceiling on expenditure in India has one flaw—it is only for candidates, not political parties. This negates or neutralises the purpose of the ceiling. You can’t spend more than 1 crore, but your party can spend 20 crores on you. So where is the level playing field? Some people say there should be state funding of elections. I oppose the idea but recommend state funding of political parties. It is difficult to monitor election expenditure because of black money. Funding political parties with cheques is what I recommend because it is easy to monitor. So you think election management is more of a problem than the electoral system?Actually, both are important, because obviously the management follows what the system prescribes. There are laws, there are rules, and they have to be followed. For instance, on political funding, there is a cap on expenditure provided by law, and the election management body implements it. Therefore, we have to improve both. Both are equally important. We say public consciousness has increased with time, but there are also concerns that people are picking right-wing leaders. So what is wrong?Actually, it’s a good question but difficult to answer. Why is it that the whole world is turning right? But there are also states like Austria where everybody was thinking the extreme right was winning, but then liberals won. So, there are exceptions. Maybe people want a strong and stable government, which has the benefit of continuity. On the other hand, such a government can be accused of majoritarianism.I heard your prime minister, Oli-ji, mentioning frequent government changes. Obviously, how can the government function with this kind of instability? On the other hand there is the prime minister of India who has been elected for the third term. It is the people's choice, and you can't fault the people. The people chose stability and a strong government, and we have to respect that.Are people not knowledgeable enough to pick the right representatives for themselves?This question is often raised. For instance, we were talking about crorepatis and criminals in politics. Almost 46 percent of MPs in India have criminal cases against them. When we talk to these MPs, they say, look, people are choosing us, so how can you blame us? That way the blame is passed on to the people.Why is the electorate choosing dishonest people against whom there are criminal cases? This debate leads us nowhere. So obviously there is something good these people with criminal background must be doing in the constituency. Maybe they commit crime outside the constituency and like Robin Hood, benefit their own people.Aam Aadmi Party was a new party, and won 67 out of 70 seats in Delhi. They managed funds through crowdfunding and volunteers. And they won hands down.What are the issues that have come up with the proliferation of social media and new media?Social media and new media have revolutionised communication. But, initially, when the election commission of India in 2012 or 2013 came out with some regulation, there was a lot of public criticism, which was unjustified. Social media is also media. So whatever applies to media will apply to social media. And in the election context, what applies to the media? Two things: How much money are you spending on buying space in the newspaper and how much money are you paying to the TV channel?Therefore, how much money are you paying to Facebook or WhatsApp, you have to account for it as well. The law on expenditure will apply to social media also. The second concern was how will the election commission catch the violators, as they are anonymous. The difficulty in catching them cannot be an excuse for not taking cognisance of their offence. If we cannot catch them today, tomorrow we will. How can something be illegal in a newspaper and legal on social media?Rumours always play a big role in elections. Social media has multiplied the problem a thousand times. Within two, three minutes, your country can be burned by false, fake news. Social media however has many benefits. For instance, instead of buying space in the newspaper and TV channel, through WhatsApp or Twitter you can reach your audience in two seconds flat.So social media is a double-edged weapon, as was the consensus in the Kantipur Conclave. And, you know, it is like a knife. Is a knife good or bad? If you want to cut an apple, it is good. If you want to cut a man’s throat, it is bad. It depends how you use it. Now, artificial intelligence has given rise to even deep fakes. But AI has benefits too. Through artificial intelligence, impersonation can be stopped. Voting and logistics can be monitored. But there is so much fraud, deep fakes, and hate. So how do you catch them? That is something we have to be wary about. Frankly, I am worried because its dangers outweigh the benefits. We have to put our heads together globally to make sure artificial intelligence doesn’t overtake human intelligence for destructive ends.In Nepal, both federal and provincial elections happen at once. India too is now mulling ‘one nation, one election’. What is your take on this?There are benefits and there are problems. Logistically, it makes sense. But one MP of Odisha posed this question: ask the people. What do they want? Poor people love frequent elections because this is the only way they can highlight their importance. Otherwise, how many times have we seen that posters are put up in a constituency with headings like ‘Missing’, or ‘Wanted’ [representatives]? Frequent elections make the representatives accountable.We heard you say that if India does ‘one nation, one election’, that will be the presidential election. What do you mean?During parliamentary elections, there are national and international issues. The issues are different in Parliament [national], Vidhan Sabha [state-level] and Panchayat [local]. I would like to say that the local body elections are as important, perhaps more important because they’re closer to the people.India’s prime minister initially said that there would be a national debate and a consensus would be reached. There was a debate for 10 years, but there was no consensus.If there was no consensus, the idea should have been dropped. But the government decided unilaterally that we will go ahead and set up a committee led by the former president of India to suggest ways to implement ‘one nation, one election’. In my articles I have questioned the propriety of a former president being drawn into a government committee.They have made some questionable recommendations. They say that simultaneous will mean Vidhan Sabha and Lok Sabha, not Panchayat. But the terms of reference clearly say that simultaneous means all three tiers. Then it says Panchayat elections can be held after 100 days. After 100 days, there is a separate election. It’s a new election and will require totally different arrangements. These are also not simultaneous elections.  \nNew Zealand all-rounder James Neesham is one of the biggest stars set to feature in the inaugural Nepal Premier League (NPL) T20 cricket tournament, scheduled from November 30 to December 21 at the TU Cricket Ground in Kirtipur, on the outskirts of the Kathmandu Valley. Neesham, 34, who has represented the Kiwis in 12 Tests, 76 ODIs, and 79 T20Is, scoring over 3,000 runs across all formats, will play for the Janakpur Bolts in this debut season of the NPL. Although Neesham hasn’t played Test cricket since 2016 and last featured in an ODI during the 2023 Cricket World Cup, he continues to be a prominent figure in franchise cricket globally. His impressive resume includes stints in the Indian Premier League with teams like Delhi Daredevils, Kings XI Punjab, Kolkata Knight Riders, Mumbai Indians and Rajasthan Royals, as well as appearances in the Vitality Blast, Bangladesh Premier League, SA20 of South Africa, The Hundred, Pakistan Super League, Big Bash League, Caribbean Premier League, and Champions League T20. Currently, he is playing for Ajman Bolts in the Abu Dhabi T10 League. Binod Pandey of Kantipur Daily, a sister publication of The Kathmandu Post, talked to Neesham through email about his upcoming participation in the NPL. Excerpt:What do you hope to gain from NPL, and how do you view Nepal’s cricketing landscape?I am really looking forward to playing cricket in a new country.

I like to think I can contribute in all facets of the game and that will be my primary objective.Having played with and against some of the world’s best cricketers, how do you think that experience will contribute to the success of Janakpur Bolts?I’m sure I will be drawing on some of our local players’ knowledge of conditions and opposition, but I do hope my experience will enable me to help the team in the ever changing match scenarios you find yourselves in when it comes to T20 cricket. What motivated you to choose Janakpur Bolts?I have recently started playing with the Bolts franchise in a few other competitions and I was keen to maintain that connection with the group, particularly in light of the positive experiences I have had with them so far. You’re famous for your sense of humor on social media. How do you plan to connect with fans during your time with Janakpur Bolts?I always love spending time with the fans whenever I play. They are the bedrock of our sport and without them the game would be a very boring place. Like I said earlier, I’ve heard such great things about Nepal’s passion for the game. I hope my performances can help ignite that further.Besides cricket, what are you most excited to experience and explore in Nepal?Whenever I visit a new place I always look forward to experiencing local cultures. Nepal’s beauty is well documented so being able to experience that first hand is an exciting prospect.Do you have any plans to explore Nepal beyond cricket?
