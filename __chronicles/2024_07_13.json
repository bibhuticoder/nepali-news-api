Write it in the form of inspiring story not news article or event.\n    \n    Story:\nOnce upon a time, nestled between the towering peaks of the Himalayas and the lush jungles of the Terai, there was a country named Nepal. Though still a developing nation, Nepal was a land of profound beauty and deep-rooted cultural heritage. The residents of Nepal faced many challenges, but beneath these hardships lay a resilient spirit and an unyielding hope for the future.\n\nThis enchanting land, where Mount Everest reaches towards the skies and the air carries a mix of incense and cool mountain breezes, was more than a geographical marvel. It was a mosaic of cultures, languages, and traditions, a testament to human endeavor against all odds. Nepal's history, from the unification under King Prithvi Narayan Shah to its transformation into a federal democratic republic, told a story of aspiration and endurance.\n\nIn recent years, the people of Nepal, with their indomitable will, had taken strides towards rebuilding and reimagining their country. They turned their struggles into stepping stones, each challenge a chapter in their ongoing saga. The shift from a monarchy to a republic had not only changed governance but had woven a new tapestry of democratic values and collective decision-making.\n\nEconomically, while agriculture continued to sustain a large part of its population, Nepal had begun to harness the potential of its picturesque landscapes, developing sustainable tourism that promised to preserve their natural heritage while boosting local economies. Communities living in the shadows of the Himalayas had become stewards of the earth, protecting the biodiversity that made their country unique.\n\nEach day brought new stories. Whether it was a festival in Kathmandu, a technological advance in Pokhara, or a conservation effort in Chitwan, these events were threads in the vibrant quilt of Nepali life. These stories, updated daily, reflected the pulse of progress and the spirit of hope that characterized this resilient nation.\n\nAnd so, as Nepal moved forward, each moment was not just a passage of time but a promise of potential, a narrative of a nation perennially climbing towards tomorrow, guided by the legacy of its past and the dreams of its future.\n\nNews events:\nCPN-UML Chairman KP Sharma Oli has staked his claim to the post of new prime minister after President Ramchandra Paudel invited a member of the House of Representatives who is able to command a majority with the support of two or more parties to do so.Following the failure of Pushpa Kamal Dahal, the outgoing prime minister, to secure a majority in Friday’s floor test, the President invited political parties to form a new government under Article 76 (2) of the Constitution of Nepal on Friday evening. Article 76 (2) says the President appoints as prime minister a member of the House of Representatives who can secure a majority with support from two or more parties. UML chief Oli presented signatures of 165 lawmakers on Friday night, shortly after the President issued the invitation giving parties until 5 pm on Sunday. Oli and Nepali Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba have jointly signed an application asking the President to appoint Oli as the new prime minister citing his majority support in the House of Representatives. “The President’s Office has received signatures from the two major parties commanding the majority in the House,” said Kiran Pokhrel, press adviser to the Paudel. “The President will study the documents submitted by the parties.” Nepali Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba, Oli and a few other leaders had visited the President’s Office to present their letter. During the conversation with Deuba and Oli, the President said he would appoint Oli the new prime minister as soon as the deadline expires and agreed to administer oath of office and secrecy immediately after 5:00 pm, Sunday. “But with the country grappling with floods and landslides and unprecedented human casualties, there is an urgency,” according to a UML leader. “So the appointment will be made on Sunday morning and the swearing-in could take place on the same afternoon.” “We submitted the signatures of Congress and UML lawmakers to the President’s Office,” Ramesh Lekhak, chief whip of the Nepali Congress, said. “It is now up to the President to decide when to appoint the new prime minister.”“With the support of the Nepali Congress, which has 88 lawmakers in the lower house, we submitted signatures of 165 lawmakers,” he added. The UML, the second largest party in the House of Representatives, has 77 lawmakers excluding the Speaker and suspended lawmaker Top Bahadur Rayamajhi, who is in jail. Deuba and Oli were accompanied by Congress chief whip Lekhak, UML chief whip Mahesh Bartuala, and other Congress and UML lawmakers when they submitted the signatures of lawmakers to the President's Office.To stake a claim to form a new government, a minimum of 138 signatures is required in the 275-seat House of Representatives. Until a new government is installed, the President has asked the outgoing prime minister, Pushpa Kamal Dahal, to serve as caretaker. Dahal lost a vote of confidence on Friday. Issuing a statement on Friday evening, the President’s Office said, “After Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal failed to secure a vote of confidence under Article 100 (3), as informed by the Speaker of the House of Representatives, a member of Parliament commanding majority support from two or more political parties is invited to submit a claim for the post of prime minister by Sunday 5:00 pm, as per Article 76 (2).”Although fringe parties, including the Janata Samajbadi Party (JSP), the JSP-Nepal, the Loktantrik Samajbadi Party, the Janamat Party and the Nagarik Unmukti Party have pledged support to the Congress-UML coalition, Oli presented his claim to the President only with the backing of the UML and the Congress. As per the July 1 deal between Congress chief Sher Bahadur Deuba and UML chair Oli, the two parties will lead the government on a rotational basis until next general elections scheduled for 2027. Besides a power-sharing deal, the two parties, in a seven-point agreement that has yet to be made public, have also agreed on several issues including amending the constitution.More political parties have extended support to the new power-sharing deal between the Congress and UML. The two parties have also started power-sharing negotiations including on division of ministerial portfolios.On Friday, soon after Dahal failed the trust vote, President Paudel consulted constitutional and legal experts on new government formation. According to the President’s Office, those consulted were Purnaman Shakya, Bipin Adhikari, Gopal Krishna Ghimire, Harihar Dahal, Sher Bahadur KC, Tikaram Bhattarai, Chandra Kant Gyawali and Sitaram KC.All constitutional experts besides Gyawali advised the President to initiate government formation as per Article 76 (2), according to a participant.Gyawali had advised the President to invoke Article 76 (3).According to Ghimire, they advised the President to call for government formation as per Article 76 (2) citing political and constitutional provisions, as well as past court verdicts. They told the President that any party commanding majority support should be given a chance.After consulting the experts, Paudel decided to call for government formation as per Article 76 (2), an aide to the President said.Prime Minister Dahal lost his position on Friday, over 18 months after his appointment.Dahal could not secure the 138 votes required to endorse the trust motion as only 63 lawmakers voted in his favour. A total of 194 lawmakers voted against him, while one member voted to stay neutral. A total of 258 lawmakers were present in Friday’s meeting of the lower House.Soon after failing to secure the confidence of the House, Prime Minister Dahal met with President Paudel to inform him of the outcome.On Friday, Dahal moved from his official residence in Baluwatar to his private residence in Khumaltar.  \nAt least 54 people are missing after two passenger buses were swept away by a mudslide into the rain-swollen Trishuli River near Simaltal along the Narayanghat-Muglin road section in the wee hours on Friday.According to Indradev Yadav, chief district officer of Chitwan, a Kathmandu-bound Angel Deluxe Bus and a Ganapati Deluxe Bus, en route to Gaur of Rautahat district from Kathmandu, were pushed into the river by the mudslide at around 3:30 am.Based on preliminary inquiry, Police said 24 people were on board the Angel Deluxe Bus travelling to Kathmandu. They included 14 Nepalis, seven Indians, and three members of the bus crew. By Friday evening details of 17 persons were established. Likewise, 30 passengers were said to be travelling on the Ganapati Deluxe Bus, but identities of only 17 of them were established by the evening, according to Deputy Superintendent of Police Bhesh Raj Rijal. Three of the passengers on the Gaur-bound bus survived. Earlier in the morning, officials had estimated that at least 60 people were on board the two buses and this figure was revised later.Nepal Police, Armed Police Force and Nepal Army personnel who were deployed to rescue the passengers worked tirelessly all day to locate the buses and survivors, but their efforts were hampered by the swelling river and continuous rainfall.Jugeshwar Raya Yadav from ward 9 of Garuda Municipality, Nandan Das from ward 1 of Gonahi Municipality, and Saroj Gupta, all from Rautahat district, managed to survive. Gupta was discharged after minor treatment at a government hospital in Bharatpur. Yadav and Das are undergoing treatment at Chitwan Medical College in Bharatpur. Jugeshwar was returning from Kathmandu after the treatment of his son and daughter. “I was in the bus along with my 10-year-old son, my daughter and two grandchildren,” Jugeshwar said. “Now I am here at the hospital, but all of them were trapped inside the bus.”According to him, the driver had stopped the bus at Simaltal for a while due to a landslide. “Later, the bus crew decided to push ahead thinking that the landslide had stopped,” he said. But the bus was swept into the river by a moving mass of mud. “I somehow got out of the bus, swam to the riverbank and climbed to the road. All others went down along with the bus,” he said. Nandan had gone to Kathmandu to initiate a process to go to Bahrain in search of work. He was returning home after submitting his passport to his agent in the Capital. “It was about an hour after we had eaten at a hotel. The bus overturned from the road. The strong water current threw me out of the bus window. I swam across the river,” he said. Rescue teams from the Nepal Army and Armed Police Force along with some divers, started a search operation at 8am. Twelve divers have been mobilised from the Disaster Management Training Institute of the APF at Kurintar. “A team of 70 trained in water-induced disasters have been deployed at the incident site. Of them 12 are divers,” Superintendent of Police Janak Puri of the institute said. The Nepal Army rescue team has 55 members. “Of them 20, including five divers, were assigned to search with boats,” Lieutenant Colonel Dinesh Lama said. A team of Nepal Police is also mobilised at the incident site. While the army and APF personnel are scouring the river, the Nepal Police team is busy with other arrangements outside the river.The teams halted their search operation after 7 pm, and plan to resume on Saturday morning. Meanwhile, rescuers have found some items including a child’s trousers and a curtain of a bus window. Based on these items, they believe they have pinpointed the location of the Angel Deluxe Bus. In a separate incident at Satrakilo along the same road section, the driver was killed after a falling boulder hit a bus. The victim, identified as Meghnath BK, died in the course of treatment at Chitwan Medical College. The bus was heading for Kathmandu from Butwal, according to Bhesh Raj Rijal, deputy superintendent of police. Likewise, landslides triggered by incessant rainfall buried 11 people to death in Kaski district.Of the victims, six members of a family and their neighbour died after being buried by the landslide in ward 19 of Pokhara Metropolitan City at around 10:15 pm on Thursday. The deceased have been identified as Kul Bahadur Pariyar, 47; his 43-year-old wife, Mana Kumari; his mother Laxima, 85; two daughters—Prabha, 20, and Prashna, 15; and son-in-law Asmit Pariyar.Their neighbour Radhika Pariyar also died while trying to rescue the victims, Deputy Superintendent of Police Basant Kumar Sharma said, quoting eyewitnesses.Three other children—aged 18, 11 and 9 years—were killed in Chainpur in ward 32 of Pokhara Metropolitan City.Likewise, the body of 80-year-old Maiti Kumari Gurung, who had gone missing in the disaster, was also found at Tallo Saple in ward 11 of Madi Rural Municipality in Kaski.All the bodies have been sent to the Pokhara Academy of Health Sciences for postmortem.“At least 15 people have died in Kaski, Myagdi, Chitwan, and Saptari districts in the past 24 hours,” said Dijan Bhattarai, information officer at the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Authority (NDRRMA) under the Ministry of Home Affairs. “The actual number of passengers who died in the two passenger buses is still being ascertained.”Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal expressed sadness over the incident and directed the authorities to conduct search and rescue operations.“I am deeply saddened by the news of nearly five dozen passengers missing after a landslide swept away buses in Simaltar of Narayanghat-Mugling road section and the loss caused by the disaster in different parts of the country,” Dahal wrote on X. “I direct all government agencies, including the home administration, to search and rescue the passengers.”Several other districts also witnessed landslides, flooding, and inundation due to the rainfall that continued since Friday last week.Debris from landslides at various locations obstructed vehicular movements, and flooding cut the road sections, leaving hundreds of passengers stranded.A Nepal Police bulletin issued on Friday afternoon said that a total of 103 people have died and 3,547 families displaced in rain-related incidents across the country since June 10.Meanwhile, the Meteorological Forecasting Division under the Department of Hydrology and Meteorology had also warned of extremely heavy rainfall in some places of the Koshi, Madhesh, Bagmati, Gandaki, and Lumbini provinces on Friday night.Met officials said that these five provinces along with Karnali Province would witness light to moderate rainfall, with a few places witnessing heavy rainfall on Saturday.“Incidents of extremely heavy rainfalls will go down Monday onwards, but rainfall will continue, as the monsoon trough is still close to the country,” said Gobinda Jha, a meteorologist at the division.The division said that Chitwan witnessed 133 mm of rainfall, where the two buses were swept into Trishuli River by the landslide. Bhairahawa witnessed 157.9 mm of rainfall, Pokhara 102.3 mm of rainfall and Udayapur 104 mm of rainfall.The monsoon season in Nepal generally begins on June 13 and ends on September 23. This year, the monsoon entered Nepal from the southwest on June 10, three days ahead of the usual onset date. Last year, it started on June 14, a day later than the normal onset day.The monsoon, which delivers around 80 percent of the country’s total annual rainfall, generally lasts for 105 days. But, in recent years, it has been taking more time to withdraw.The division has forecast above-normal rains and above-average maximum and minimum temperatures this monsoon, which could unleash extreme weather events such as flooding, inundation, and landslides.Nepal is one of the world’s most vulnerable countries to the climate crisis and has witnessed multiple extreme weather events over the past decade and a half.Evidence suggests that maximum temperatures in Nepal are rising faster, at 0.056 degrees Celsius a year, compared to the global average rise of 0.03 degrees Celsius a year.Experts say extreme weather events—excessive rainfall in a short period, continuous rains for several days after the monsoon, dry spells, droughts, below-average precipitation, and above-normal winter temperatures—have become more frequent in Nepal.The National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Authority estimates that 1.81 million people and 412,000 households will be affected by monsoon this year. Of them, 83,000 households will be directly impacted, and 18,000 families will require rescue due to monsoon-related disasters. \nNepal’s central bank has allowed Nepali payment system operators to deal with digital retail payments in any country. For example, a Nepali payment system operator (PSO) can now agree with any PSO in any country to launch the quick response (QR) code payment system for the citizens of both countries to make purchases. Nepal Rastra Bank issued a circular on June 27, allowing a merchant-to-person payment (M2P) system. PSOs can now make agreements with PSOs of any country and start the service. However, before signing a memorandum of understanding, the PSOs need the central bank’s approval.“The central bank has fully opened the retail payment system. Nepali PSOs and PSOs of any country can now jointly start the retail payment service through QR code,” said Gunakar Bhatta, executive director of the Payment Systems Department at Nepal Rastra Bank.As the central bank has allowed merchant payment on the purchase of goods and services, the PSOs have started taking approval to start the service, Bhatta said. By coordinating on issues like bank settlement and dispute settlement, the licensed private sector PSOs can start the service.The central bank said that the withdrawal limit for a Nepali in a foreign country would be according to the existing foreign exchange rule, which is $2,500 per visit and $5,000 annually. There are 10 PSOs operating in the country as of mid-May.The QR code system in Nepal is relatively new.Starting March 1, Indians were allowed to make payments through their mobile phones. The development was hailed as a milestone in cross-border digital payment between Nepal and India, facilitating the students and people going to India for medical purposes.Nepal’s Fonepay, a PSO, has partnered with India’s NPCI International Payments to launch the cross-border payment service using quick response (QR) codes.With the central bank's provision, Fonepay has already started working, allowing Nepali nationals to make QR code payments in India.On June 1 last year, Fonepay signed a memorandum of understanding with Sri Lanka’s National Payment Network—LankaPay, to collaborate on a strategic partnership to revolutionise the digital payment landscape by developing an interoperable digital payment system that enables users to transact seamlessly across the two countries.However, in the lack of regulations, the QR code payment system did not start. “We have requested the approval for QR code payment service with Sri Lanka. We will soon start the facility,” said Paras Kunwar, chief operating officer (COO) of Fonepay. “Besides Sri Lanka, China is another market that we are looking at. We have started discussions with China UnionPay and Alipay+ to make cross-border QR code payments.”In May 2019, Nepal banned WeChat Pay and AliPay, stating that online payments through unregistered systems were illegal and resulted in a loss of income for Nepal. WeChat Pay, operating on Tencent’s messaging service, and e-commerce giant Alibaba’s Alipay are the two dominant platforms in mainland China.In June last year, Chinese digital payment service WeChat Pay and NMB Bank Nepal partnered to make the mobile payment system available in Nepal, allowing Chinese nationals visiting Nepal to pay for their purchases using their mobile sets.Kunwar said they would begin a QR code system in India from August. “For this, Nepali commercial banks are working on transaction limits and other issues.“We also need to adhere to many provisions including anti-money laundering and combating the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) before starting the cross-border payment services.”Kunwar said that the company is looking for other potential markets overseas where most Nepalis reside. For instance, South Korea is another prospective market for QR code payment.“We are looking into whether remittances can be sent through QR code if the central bank allows it. Nepal can be a potential market for tourists from South Korea and Japan and the service can allow them to withdraw money in Nepal.”Just like regional economic blocs, the payment service has also started making regional payment blocs. There is Asian Payment Network, a retail payment platform supported by the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), Kunwar said.“There are 17 members of the Asian Payment Network of ASEAN, including Sri Lanka from South Asia. Fonepay recently became a member of the Asian Payment Network, and with this, we can integrate the system with the 17 member countries.”The QR code system has become a boon for tourists, especially those from India.For instance, within three months of starting QR code payments to Indian citizens, Fonepay is handling around Rs5 million transactions daily. It has reduced the hassle of carrying cash. The Nepal government has banned all Indian notes above the denomination of 100.With the Fonepay service available in Muktinath and trekking areas connected to Pokhara, Indian tourists are increasingly withdrawing money while in these areas. According to a central bank report, QR code transactions sharply increased to Rs52.75 billion in mid-May from Rs45.67 billion in mid-April, after Nepal allowed Indian citizens to make payment via QR code in Nepal. The number of transactions also increased to 17.63 million from 16.10 million during the review period.QR code transactions increased to Rs53.88 billion from mid-May to mid-June, with a total of 19.82 million transactions. \nPrime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal lost a vote of confidence at the House of Representatives on Friday, prompting President Ramchandra Paudel to trigger a new government formation process and KP Sharma Oli of the CPN-UML to claim the prime minister’s position with the backing of the Nepali Congress. Dahal lost his position as only 63 lawmakers gave him the vote of confidence, less than half the majority figure of 138 in the 275-member House.Of the 258 present, 194 lawmakers voted against the motion while one stayed neutral. Apart from the support of his own CPN (Maoist Centre), Dahal retained the support of only two parties in his government—the Rastriya Swatantra Party and the CPN (Unified Socialist). Other coalition partners stood against him. The prime minister saw a huge erosion in support from his first vote of confidence in January last year when he enjoyed an overwhelming support of over 98 percent of lawmakers. The support on Friday shrank to 22 percent of lawmakers, in the span of less than a year and half.Dahal had a constitutional obligation to face the vote of confidence after the CPN-UML, the largest party in the Dahal government, withdrew its support on July 3 after an agreement to form a new government together with the Nepali Congress.The country's largest communist party forged a deal with the Congress on July 1 to replace the Dahal government.Rejection of the motion was a given with the country's two largest parties—the Congress and the UML—partnered with some fringe parties against the government and the prime minister was aware of it. Yet the frustration at losing the prime ministerial berth was visible in his address to the House on Friday. He claimed that the two-party deal was not spontaneous but was well orchestrated by \"somebody else\".\"You didn’t unite on your own, someone else did [brought you together],\" he said while addressing the House. \"Why would the deal between the two largest parties be signed in a dark room if it was done with a good intent?\"The prime minister spent a half of his 80-minute speech presenting the achievements of his government made in a year and half since its formation in December 2022. The other half went to lashing out at the Congress-UML partnership. As the leader from both parties claim, their yet-to-be-disclosed deal is grounded in two themes: ensuring stability to drive the country on the path of prosperity and amending the constitution for the country's benefit. Through his address, Dahal gave a clear message that his party would make criticising these issues its primary task.“It is an open secret that you [the Congress and the UML] want to go back to 1990 in the name of stability. You are trying to remove inclusive principles and proportional representation in the name of stability,” said the prime minister. “Was there stability when you two parties had the system of your choice? Are you not the same parties that formed 15 governments between 1991 and 2005?”He accused the Congress and the UML of conspiring against the marginalised and underprivileged communities by amending the constitution. Claiming that the two traditional parties want to opt for electing the lower house fully under the first-past-the-post (FPTP) and making the National Assembly fully inclusive. This move according to Dahal is an attempt to deprive the people from minority and underprivileged communities from becoming the prime minister.Only a member of the House of Representatives is eligible to become the prime minister as per the constitution. “People are fully aware. Nobody can revoke the rights achieved through huge struggle and sacrifice,” said Dahal, warning multiple times that the country would head towards another conflict if the constitution was amended as planned by the two parties. The Maoist supremo also dared the two parties to amend the constitution without his party’s support.Though securing two-thirds majority in the lower house without the support of the Maoist Centre is possible, that is not the case in the upper house. With 17 seats excluding the chairperson, the Maoist Centre is the largest party in the National Assembly. An amendment to the constitution must be endorsed by the two-thirds majority of both chambers of Parliament. Dahal pointed out that, prior to the second people’s movement in 2006, Dalits’ representation was close to zero, women’s representation was hovering around 5 percent while the representation of janajatis and Madheshi’s was token. Their representation in state organs increased significantly after the Maoist party entered Parliament through the reinstated House of Representatives, he said. The inclusive provisions were later enshrined in the Interim Constitution first in 2007 and in the Constitution of Nepal drafted by the Constituent Assembly in 2015. The prime minister, however, said his party was ready for an amendment to the constitution not in squeezing proportional representation but for ensuring 50 percent women’s representation in the state machinery, increasing the representation of other marginalised communities and having a directly elected executive head of the country. The Maoist Centre has long been pushing for the directly elected executive head, right since the time of the Constituent Assembly. But, as the Congress refused to ditch the parliamentary system, its demand couldn’t materialise. Dahal was critical in his Friday speech towards the Congress as well but not as bitter as towards the UML and its chairman Oli. He said nobody can beat Oli in conspiracy. Stating that he agreed to switch the ruling partner from the Congress to the UML because Oli argued that if not united the Maoist Centre and the UML would meet the fate of the communist movement in West Bengal. “I believed that time changes people but I was wrong. Some people can never shed their ego,” said Dahal, hinting at Oli. Countering the UML’s call for him to resign on moral grounds, Dahal said, “Those who are habituated to dissolve parliament and their supporters tried to teach me moral lessons. I just want to stress that the CPN (Maoist Centre) has the highest level of investment in this constitution,” he said, asking the Congress to be vigilant that Oli can deceive it too. In turn, along with the UML and the Nepali Congress, other party lawmakers also countered Dahal. Speaking after him, Congress chief whip Ramesh Lekhak said the constitution would be amended without distorting its inclusive spirit. “You have every quality to become the opposition leader. It was our mistake to make you the prime minister repeatedly,” he said.Also addressing the House, UML lawmaker Yogesh Bhattarai asked Dahal to stop politics in the name of Dalits, janajatis and other marginalised communities. “Do you know what is the fate of Magars from Rolpa who waged the war for you? Do you have any idea what your Dalit supporters are doing these days?” Bhattarai asked. “You are in illusion, if you still think you can spark a conflict through provocative statements.” Gyan Bahadur Shahi, chief whip of the Rastriya Swatantra Party, was one of those who accused Dahal of not doing enough on his part when it comes to giving opportunity to those from dalit and indigenous communities.“Why didn’t you promote a leader from the adivasi community as the party chief just like we in the RPP have done,” Shahi said. “Why didn’t you appoint at least one dalit minister in your Cabinet?” \nWithin the rich heritage of Newa art, you might have heard of Paubha or Thanka, two types of cloth painting known for their religious iconography. Many tourists leave Nepal with at least one of the two tucked away in their suitcases, hoping to hang a unique reminder of their travels on their walls. But for foreigners and Nepalis alike, few have heard of Bilampau, an elusive narrative art style that may have been inspired by Paubha. Bilampau in Newa means horizontal painting.Though Paubha is a much more established and recognisable Newa art form, both Paubha and Bilampau are scroll paintings guided by Thyaa-saphu, folded sketchbooks that were kept by Newa families. Thyaa-saphu stipulates necessary thematic and narrative elements for Buddhist stories; Bilampau, for example, often begins with the figure of the narrator themselves, whether it be Lord Buddha—common in Buddhist scroll paintings—or Lord Ganesha, in the case of Hindu stories.But Madan Chitrakar, renowned artist, researcher, and scholar, reveals that the similarities between Paubha and Bilampau largely end there. “The subject matter and motifs are very different,” he says. While Paubha’s religious characteristics support meditation and worship, the importance of storytelling is prominent in Bilampau and its “narrative scroll” composition. Unlike Paubha, Bilampau depicts stories with multiple elements and episodes. This sequence is often established through a collection of frames on one scroll, though some Bilampau artworks utilise a single scroll without frame-by-frame separation. Swosti Rajbhandari Kayastha, museologist, curator for Nepal Art Council, and curator of the current Itumbaha museum exhibition, emphasises that Bilampau are not meant for veneration. “In ancient times, they didn’t have comic books, right?” she jokes. Instead, visual storytelling was done through creations like Bilampau.On June 18, 2024, Siddhartha Art Gallery opened its doors to the public for its most recent exhibition on Kalighat paintings, Ganjifa playing cards, and Bilampau. Though the gallery certainly focused on the legacy of Kalighat, all three art forms underscore the unique cultural ties between Nepal and India.At the opening, artist Chitrakar also spoke on the significance of Bilampau, calling it one of the most “misunderstood” forms in Nepali art history.What does it mean to truly understand an art form? And when it comes to the expansive depths of art history, what does it mean to remember an art form in its entirety? How can we revive a dying art form back into the collective consciousness of the twenty-first century?The earliest existence of the visual narrative technique in Nepal can be traced back to the 12th century, depicted not through scroll but through wood. Newa artists were also likely commissioned to create Bilampau for specific walls in Buddhist temples, hence its impressive horizontal length. Indeed, Bilampau also holds some surprising diversity in sizes and dimensions, with many ranging from nine feet to a whopping 78 feet in length—a testament to its visual significance.Comparisons can also be drawn between Bilampau and Patachitra, a cloth painting form based in West Bengal, Odisha, and Rajasthan. Both Bilampau and Patachitra were created by Chitrakar artists in India and Nepal, and the two forms also share a reputation for story-telling. However, Bilampau is more commonly horizontal, while Patachitra is typically vertical in its episodic visualisation.It is possible that Bilampau grew into its own art form from the influence of Patachitra, signifying another historical connection between India and Nepal, but so little is known about the evolution of Bilampau that it is difficult to come to a precise conclusion about its origins.Today, most traditional Buddhist Bilampau are kept in local monasteries. According to Chitrakar, one of the most famous Bilampau is currently held in Itum Bahal. Kayastha notes that the Bilampau in Itum Bahal depicts the foundation of the Itum Bahal monastery.During the Newa Gunla festival, which is celebrated according to the lunar calendar, the significance of Bilampau storytelling is also treasured amongst Vihara and Newa Buddhists. “For fifteen days,” Kayastha explains, “all the monasteries will display the objects they have in their storage, which people have donated over time. One of those objects would be the Bilampau.” Kayastha highlights that the Bilampau is not only a source of education regarding the monastery’s history but also a source of community engagement. Members of the community take it upon themselves to safeguard their heritage and cultural objects, usually sleeping in the same room as the Bilampau and other artefacts.At Siddhartha Art Gallery, there are two Bilampau, both depicting Hindu stories; due to the artistic shift towards Hinduism, the older Bilampau, consisting largely of Buddhist stories, is much less accessible.Bilampau is no longer an active form in traditional Nepali art, which means that truly understanding its significance also begets recognising its disappearance from popular Nepali art discourse. Despite being one of the earliest forms of visual story-telling in Nepal, “it is almost forgotten,” remarks Chitrakar.A quick Google search of ‘Bilampau’ results few substantial results except for a single scholarly article written by Chitrakar himself.The fear of this art form growing obsolete extends far beyond art history, just as art history itself holds broader implications on the importance of culture and identity.In Nepal, Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal declared that the country’s citizens share a common responsibility to protect traditional Indigenous culture, calling it the “identity and prestige” of Nepal as a whole.Traditional festivals and art forms are certainly still celebrated and recognised, whether it be on the streets of Kathmandu or within one of the city’s museums or galleries, but several artisans and scholars have shared their growing concerns about the future of traditional Nepali art.Many artists from the older generation, for example, fear that the younger generation will no longer continue the artistic practices—such as Paubha painting—that their families have inherited for generations.We must take it upon ourselves to raise awareness and actively engage with the artists and cultural significance that accompanies these forms—otherwise, our collective apathy might result in these traditions reaching the same untimely fate as Bilampau.Though Bilampau died out a century ago, one method of reviving its presence might entail a call for collectors to bring their Bilampau pieces forward, increasing public accessibility. For others, simply talking about Bilampau and remembering its place in history might be more than enough.“When we talk about Nepali art traditions,” says Chitrakar, “we must not miss Bilampau,” echoing the value in appreciating a lesser-known art form. And when we remember Bilampau, we must also hold on to the other art forms that are still surviving, carrying legacies that have spanned across entire wars, nations, and generations—and, if all goes well, with many more journeys to come. \nTo reduce patient deaths in hospital emergencies, the Ministry of Health and Population has initiated basic life support training for healthcare workers, including medical doctors, nurses, and paramedics, with the aim of significantly lowering emergency-related deaths.\nNepal’s Prime Minister Dahal resigns after a coalition government is formed between Nepali Congress and CPN-UML, raising concerns about the repetitive nature of coalition culture in the country.\nRampant corruption in Nepal involves senior officials and political parties, eroding public trust and hindering sustainable development efforts despite government arrests of low-level individuals.\nFatal interbreeding between wild and domestic animals threatens endangered species, and resolving the conflict between conservation and herders requires balancing protections for both.\nAmid criticism, India's Modi and Russia's Putin agreed to repatriate Indian soldiers fighting in Ukraine, in contrast to Nepal's ongoing struggle to bring back its citizens.\nProject 2025, a conservative policy proposal touted by some of Trump's closest advisers, is being used by opponents to highlight potential authoritarian dangers if Trump is re-elected.\nWritten by philosophy enthusiast Bishnu Sapkota, ‘Adiyeka Paila’ is a novel that explains the complicated dynamics of feelings in human relationships. Astitwa and Anasuya are the protagonists of the novel. Another character of the story, Bandana, stands to be the deuteragonist. And no, the book is not about the love triangle. Instead, it is about a candid narration of each character's feelings, which ultimately shape their life. Astitwa is introduced as a university teacher of Kirtipur. He teaches English literature to university students. Anasuya is an MBBS student. Astitwa and Anasuya meet through Anusaya’s father, Mani, a professor at Kirtipur University. To assist Astitwa with completing his thesis, Astitwa’s friend Pramod advises him to coordinate with Mani. Their first interaction is similar to the novel ‘Lolita’ setting. Astitwa, in his 20s, is seven years older than Anusuya, who is still a minor.Anasuya instantly falls for Astitwa upon seeing him in her house. Additionally, as an MBBS student passionate about literature, it's easy to see why Anasuya would develop an infatuation with someone knowledgeable, single, and a literature lover like herself.The pair starts going on dates, and their conversation often concerns philosophically defining love. Astitwa’s take on love combines all the principles he has absorbed as a university student. Contrary to this, Anasuya is introverted in expressing herself yet bolder and wiser when approaching matters of love. She postulates that love has little to do with rationality and reasoning. However, Astitwa states, “Love was made to ease the complexities of navigating societal norms and emotional landscapes. Therefore, there is no guarantee that tomorrow love will not wither.” The author has effectively assessed the maturity levels between boys and girls in love. His analysis addresses the widely debated and often clichéd notion that girls generally show more maturity than boys.The journey of their attraction blooming into love is characterised by beautiful butterfly moments that aren’t discussed in depth in other books I have read. The discourse surrounding such intricate details assures the reader like it has assured me, that it is expected to fixate on the qualities of someone you admire. The following dialogue perfectly captures the essence of one’s obsession. “After all, everyone is made up of the elements of feelings. No matter how many logical arguments we make, our actions are driven by our emotions”. The entire plot of the novel rests on a single premise, much like in movies, where an actor portrays various characters in different films, the roles in the novel shift and change based on the circumstances and contexts the characters face.Similarly, human beings play various roles in their own lives. Our existence is dynamic and multifaceted, enabling us to embody different versions of ourselves as we navigate different phases and experiences.The author’s background as a columnist may have inspired the progression of social issues in the novel. Astitwa’s students, Bandana and Mohan, are victims of the repercussions of the Maoist Conflict in Nepal. Mohan, a member of the Madhesi community, moves to Kathmandu to study for his master's. Once there, he gains a clearer perspective on the silent discrimination his community faces.An article by JB Pun Magar on the topic ‘Manu Smriti, Muluki Ain and the rise of Bahuns’ rightly captures the dilemma that Mohan faces regarding the accusations of the ruling caste where they maintain that indigenous people incite division with ethnicity-based federalism. At the same time, the indigenous people contend that the ruling class perpetuates racism through historical privilege and marginalisation of ethnic communities. Similarly, Bandana, who has lost her father during the Maoist insurgency, confides in Astitwa regarding her struggles with the grief of losing a parent. However, the bond that Anasuya and Astiwa share isn’t love, as the author mentions through his exaggerated explanation of love, feelings, and rationality.Either one has attachment issues, or, in modern language, they are in a “situationship”. The novel is slow running in its pace yet steadfast in developing new arcs in the plot. Before Bandana, Astitwa and Anasuya had already stopped talking to each other. This incident not only takes a toll on Anusuya's mental health but also disrupts her relationship with her parents.The fallout occurs because Astitwa insists that Anasuya reveal their relationship to her parents. Despite her opposition, Anasuya complies with her boyfriend's demands.Her parents are not entirely opposed to this new information, yet it is a task for them, especially the father, to accept that his daughter will grow up to be an adult. As the story unfolds, Astistwa receives a scholarship for his PhD program from Notre Dame University, one of the most prestigious universities in the US. After spending nearly six years in the US, Astitwa returned to Nepal despite the opposition of his colleagues from Kirtipur who had settled abroad.At this particular juncture, the author has painted the picture of the stark realities faced by many Nepali students studying abroad. The novel does not conclude with a typical Cinderella ending, where estranged lovers reconcile. Instead, it features a mature and unconventional ending, allowing readers to uncover the explanation as the story progresses gradually.However, the novel’s characters stand to be romantic and slightly idealised, which makes it difficult for an ordinary reader to fully encapsulate the duality and complexities portrayed by the author. In hindsight, the novel is an excellent portrayal of one’s deepest feelings, which are layered by the principles and conventions built by society around us. Through the characters, the author urges the readers never to eschew the inevitable waves of emotions that shape our deepest selves. Drawing from his experience living abroad, the author implies the importance of culture and native language in authentically expressing one’s emotions.Adiyeka PailaAuthor: Bishnu SapkotaPublisher: Fine PrintYear:2023 \nThe weather across the country is forecast to be partly to generally cloudy on Saturday.Light to moderate rain accompanied by thunder and lightning is expected in several regions, including Koshi Province, Karnali Province, Gandaki Province, Lumbini Province, and Bagmati Province.

The President made the decision after the Speaker of the House of Representatives sent a letter to the Office of the President stating that Prime Minister Dahal’s motion was not endorsed by a majority.Prime Minister Dahal lost his position on Friday, over 18 months after his appointment, as he failed to secure a vote of confidence during a floor test in the House of Representatives.Dahal couldn’t secure the 138 votes required to endorse the trust motion as only 63 lawmakers voted in his favour in the 275-member House of Representatives. A total of 194 lawmakers voted against him, while a member cast a no vote. A total of 258 lawmakers were present in Friday’s meeting of the lower House.Soon after failing to secure a vote of confidence in the House of Representatives, Prime Minister Dahal met with President Paudel to inform him of the outcome. On Friday, Dahal moved from his official residence in Baluwatar to his private residence in Khumaltar. \nPresident Joe Biden faced more calls from fellow Democrats to abandon his re-election bid on Friday, following a news conference in which he delivered nuanced responses but occasionally stumbled over his words.It was unclear whether Biden’s performance would convince doubters in his party that he is their best bet to defeat Republican Donald Trump in the Nov. 5 election and serve another four-year term in the White House.At least 17 congressional Democrats so far have called for him to drop out and allow the party to pick another standard-bearer, including some who announced their positions after the news conference on Thursday night.Democrats are worried that Biden’s low public approval ratings and growing concerns that he is too old for the job could cause them to lose seats in the House and Senate, leaving them with no grip on power in Washington should Trump win the White House.But Biden made clear that he did not plan to step aside.“If I show up at the convention and everybody says they want someone else, that’s the democratic process,” Biden said, before shifting to the stage whisper he often uses for emphasis to add, “It’s not gonna happen.”Biden perhaps did not reassure those who were spooked by his poor presidential debate performance against Trump on June 27.At one point, he referred to his vice president, Kamala Harris, as “Vice President Trump”. That came just hours after he introduced Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy as “President Putin” at the NATO summit, drawing gasps from those in the room.Biden occasionally garbled his responses at the news conference, yet he also delivered detailed assessments of global issues, including Ukraine’s war with Russia and the Israel-Gaza conflict, that served as a reminder of his decades of experience on the world stage.Some Democrats were not reassured.“We must put forward the strongest candidate possible to confront the threat posed by Trump’s promised MAGA authoritarianism. I no longer believe that is Joe Biden,” said Representative Jim Himes of Connecticut, who called on the president to end his campaign after the news conference.But one influential party figure, Representative James Clyburn of South Carolina, reiterated his support on Friday morning.“I am all in. I’m riding with Biden no matter which direction he goes,” he said on NBC’s “Today” program.A senior campaign official who spoke on condition of anonymity called the performance the “worst of all worlds. Not good. But not bad enough to make him change his mind ... It’ll give some enough cover to back him publicly, only to say he’s not up for it privately.”Fundraiser Dmitri Melhorn said other donors told him they saw a strong performance from the president. “This is the person who can beat Trump. The mistakes are baked in and the upside is strong,” he told Reuters.Biden will hold a rally on Friday in Detroit, where his campaign says he will focus on the “dangers” of Trump’s agenda.The Michigan city is also headquarters of the United Auto Workers labor union, whose leaders endorsed Biden but now are assessing their options, three sources told Reuters.With most US voters firmly divided into ideological camps, opinion polls show the race remains close.An NBC/PBS poll released on Friday found Biden leading Trump 50% to 48%, a slight increase from his position before the debate. Biden fared slightly worse than Trump when third-party candidates were included in the questioning.A Reuters/Ipsos poll released last week found Biden and Trump tied at 40% each. But some nonpartisan analysts have warned that Biden is losing ground in the handful of competitive states that will determine the outcome of the election. \nImports from China to Nepal rose more sharply than expected in the first eleven months of the current fiscal year ending mid-June, while imports from India continued to tumble.According to the Trade and Export Promotion Center, the national trade promotion body, Nepal’s imports from China increased by 34.8 percent in the review period. In comparison, imports from India fell by 3.1 percent.Experts attributed ballooning imports from China to a sharp rise in the entry of electric vehicles (EVs). Likewise, a fall in imports from India has been attributed to the export curbs on food by the southern neighbour. In terms of value, imports from China increased by Rs70.44 billion to Rs272.81 billion in the review period.Import from India, however, dropped by Rs29.53 billion to Rs908.30 billion in the period.Due to the drop in imports from India, Nepal’s total imports declined 1.8 percent to Rs1.45 trillion in the first eleven months of the current fiscal year, which ended mid-June 2024.An official of the National Statistics Office says for a consumption-driven economy, falling imports are a worrisome sign. This suggests people are spending less on services and consumption while exports are stagnant.Rabindra Duwadi, the spokesperson at the Trade and Export Promotion Center, said imports from the north were driven by a massive influx of EVs, smartphones, and readymade garments.Besides, exports of iron, chemical fertiliser, apples and readymade garments too rose significantly. Traders said that China fulfils 80 percent of Nepal's readymade garment needs. The country imported readymade garments worth Rs33.67 billion in the first 11 months of the current fiscal year.In the same vein, Nepal imported 7,931 EVs worth Rs21.83 billion from China in the first 11 months of the current fiscal year, up from 1,269 EVs worth Rs3.75 billion in the same period last fiscal year.Similarly, the country imported 1.23 million units of smartphones worth Rs17.27 billion from China in the review period. During the time, Nepal imported 99,965 tonnes of chemical fertiliser worth Rs8.69 billion from China.In the first 11 months of the current fiscal year, the country imported 65,827 tonnes of apples worth Rs6.98 billion from China, compared to 50,153 tonnes worth Rs4.73 billion in the same period last fiscal year.Duwadi said India’s share of Nepal’s total imports is 65.5 percent, while China contributes 18.8 percent. Traders say Nepal’s trade with India is vast, but it is steadily shifting to China. “One key reason for import growth from China is EVs,” said Rajan Sharma, a trade expert. “Chinese EVs are comparatively cheaper and perform better compared to Indian ones.” According to market observers, that’s why there has been an abrupt switch from India’s Tata Nexon EV to Chinese BYD.Sharma said readymade garments imported from China are cheaper compared to Indian readymade garments, including branded ones, which makes them popular among Nepali customers. “At the same time, India-made branded clothing items are expensive.”The Chinese Shein clothing brand has quickly gained popularity in Nepal due to its trendy clothes and reasonable prices.Trade experts say that due to the open border, there has been a massive rise in informal trade from India in recent years. Smuggling has thrived after India imposed a ban on foods.According to a research report titled, ‘Dynamics of informal cross-border trade in agricultural products between Nepal and India,’ prepared by South Asia Watch on Trade, Economics and Environment, only 40 percent of rice is imported from India through formal channels.India’s share in Nepal’s imports in formal trade is 60 percent, but the share of informal trade is likely to be higher.The research has pointed out that informal trade has thrived after the imposition of a 9 percent agriculture reform fee and a 2.5 percent advanced income tax, resulting in a total duty of 11.5 percent on rice imports.The paper said that India’s ban on rice and other agricultural exports has led to massive smuggling of food through the 1,800 km porous border between Nepal and India.Nepal is dependent on onions imported from India. When the Indian government imposed a ban on onion exports from December 2023 to May 2024, the product was readily available in the vegetable market and grocery stores, which indicated that a massive quantity of onions came through informal trade channels.The government did not take a single step to control the illegal trade or negotiate with the Indian government to ease the repeated bans on export of various agricultural goods. Nepal has thus lost out on huge import revenue as goods are coming to Nepal through illegal channels and are easily available in the market.Paras Kharel, executive director of the South Asia Watch on Trade, Economics and Environment, said overall imports have not been able to rebound in two fiscal years, reflecting the country’s economic slowdown. However, the rise in EV imports contributed to the sudden rise in imports from China.“Imports from Tatopani and Rasuwa customs rose by twice as much,” Kharel said. This shows that imports from China, which were halted after the Covid pandemic, are not gradually improving but are ballooning.According to the Department of Customs, the worth of imports from Tatopani customs increased to Rs37.16 billion in the first 11 months of the current fiscal year, compared to Rs11.79 billion in the same period last fiscal year.Similarly, the worth of imports from Rasuwa customs on the northern border increased to Rs55.45 billion in the review period, up from Rs27.25 billion in the same period last fiscal year. \nThe National Human Rights Commission has said that the Enforced Disappearances Enquiry, Truth and Reconciliation Commission Act must include war crimes and crimes against humanity as serious violations of human rights while also ensuring justice to former Maoist child soldiers.The constitutional human rights watchdog made its position public as the three major parties worked to finalise the amendment bill to the Act under consideration in a parliamentary committee. Neither the existing Act nor the amendment bill includes war crimes, crimes against humanity and the issues of child combatants. In its report “The National Human Rights Commission and Transitional Justice”, the commission has said that together with murder, enforced disappearance, abduction or disappearances after the kidnapping, torture, rape or other sexual violence, war crimes and crimes against humanity should also be classified as non-amnestiable crimes.The 150-page report the commission is set to unveil on Monday includes its position on the long-pending transitional justice process while also documenting the efforts it made to deliver justice to the war-era victims of human rights violations. Since its establishment in 2002, the commission has investigated 1,073 cases related to the 1996-2006 insurgency and recommended actions against 222 including former Home Secretary and chief of Nepal Police.Following successive governments’ reluctance to follow its recommendations, the commission made public the list of perpetrators in October 2020 and January 2024.The leaders in negotiation are still struggling to finalise whether to list murder as a serious violation of human rights. Despite long negotiations, they have yet to sort out issues of minor Maoist soldiers and sentence reduction. They are also divided on whether victims who refuse to reconcile should be allowed to take their cases to court.The commission’s report says killing any unarmed individual, regardless of their involvement in the conflict, or those not directly involved in the fight, is a serious violation of human rights. There cannot be amnesty for serious violations of human rights, including war crimes and crimes against humanity. Amnesty for other human rights violations is possible only with the written consent of the victims, according to the commission.“Those who refuse pardon should be allowed to seek legal remedy as per the existing laws,” reads the report. “The truth and Reconciliation Commission must delve into the cases of the victims who lost their lives or got injured in landmines planted during the insurgency even after the peace process began.” Issues of child Maoist combatants must be addressed through the law to ensure they get justice, according to the commission.The use of minors in armed conflict is a war crime as per international law. The ruling Maoist Centre, therefore, does not want to include this issue in the law.During the verification process for army integration conducted by UNMIN in 2007, thousands of Maoist fighters had been disqualified for being minors. Among the 4,008 combatants who did not qualify for integration, 2,973 were verified as minors, while the remaining 1,035 had joined the Maoist ‘People’s Liberation Army’ after the first ceasefire of May 26, 2006—six months before the signing of the peace deal. The government had provided between Rs500,000 and Rs800,000 each to the combatants who chose voluntary retirement. However, those who were disqualified didn’t get any substantial support, except for a few thousand rupees from the United Nations.A group of former child soldiers led by Lenin Bista have filed a writ petition at the Supreme Court demanding the prosecution of the then Maoist supreme commander Pushpa Kamal Dahal, now the country’s prime minister, and the then ‘people’s government’ chief Baburam Bhattarai, who also is a former prime minister. The final hearing for the petition has been slated for September.Unlike in other issues, the commission has stood with the political parties on reduced sentencing. “The jail term of convicts who meet the criteria [perpetrators cooperating in the investigation process], can be reduced to a minimum of 25 percent as per existing laws,” reads the report. “The criteria for reduced sentencing can be defined in the law.” Surya Dhungel, a commissioner, said their position is based on international practice where reduced sentencing is common in transitional justice process.The commission has also reiterated that it will send its representative to the panel formed to recommend office bearers in the two transitional justice mechanisms only if there is a commitment from the parties concerned to amend the Act. “We are firm in our decision. Commitment from top political leadership is a must for the commission to send its representative to the recommendation committee,” said Dhungel. \nIn the early 1980s, Nepal’s firebrand communist leader, Mohan Bikram Singh, split from his comrade Nirmal Lama to establish a radical political alternative. Lama and Singh had earlier revolted from the Communist Party of Nepal to establish their own faction after the party’s fourth convention in 1974. Among Singh’s trusted leaders were Mohan Baidya, Pushpa Kamal Dahal, CP Gajurel and Dev Gurung. But Singh was forced to spend most of the following years politically exiled in India. As a result, Baidya effectively captured the party, renaming it the Communist Party of Nepal (CPN), “Mashal,” pronounced slightly different from Lama’s CPN “Masal.” However, Baidya and many senior party leaders faced self-imposed demotion after the party suffered a strategic setback in the now infamous ‘Sector Scandal’. Baidya was forced to nominate Dahal as the party leader in 1989, a position Dahal has held for three and a half decades.During the first two decades of his leadership, Dahal reigned supreme, as his party led the country into a decade-long violent political conflict that claimed, by some estimates, over 16,000 lives. Despite substantial economic and political costs, the conflict accelerated Nepal’s transition from a semi-feudal society with an exclusive political system into a more inclusive and secular republic. To that end, the Dahal-led Maoist party received due recognition through a popular mandate of the 2008 first Constituent Assembly elections. But Dahal’s unnecessary distrust of Nepal’s more established political parties, which had played a considerable role in bringing his party back into the political mainstream, made him commit blunders and unseated him from a comfortable majority government. His suspicion against fellow comrades who questioned his leadership style and decisions led to multiple splintering of the Maoist party. An insecure leaderDespite leading the country in and out of a transformative political conflict and becoming one of the key signatories of the new constitution, Dahal has remained an insecure leader who takes every opportunity to remind the Nepali people and the world about his “revolutionary contributions”. Possibly, this deep-seated insecurity emerges from the fact that he is neither seen as an intellectually gifted politician like his fellow comrade Baburam Bhattarai, who is known as an ideologue of the Maoist conflict or as a leader with integrity and simplicity like that of his political gurus Singh and Baidya. The thought of losing the political legacy of the ‘People’s War’ despite clinging onto the leadership of the party must constantly haunt the Maoist supremo.Dahal’s insecurity and political hypocrisy were also palpable in the way he derided the Madhesh Movement, which also raised the agendas of federalism and inclusion. Instead of considering them allies, Dahal ordered his party cadres to attack the Madheshi party leaders and their cadres. A large part of the political onus of escalating the tensions leading to the unfortunate Gaur massacre in 2007 will always rest on Dahal. Over the past decade and a half, Dahal has repeatedly failed to display the leadership he is ironically fond of discussing. Despite mobilising thousands of Tharu youths during the conflict, he failed to support their genuine claims on provincial boundaries during the federal structuring. And despite claims of his ‘one-sided love’ for Madhesh, he remained silent as more than 50 Madhesi protesters were indiscriminately killed by the security forces in 2015. Unreliable coalition partnerThere was a time when Dahal led a party that had shaken the country’s political core. Less than two decades later, he now leads a party that has mostly eroded its political base and only relies on a stronger coalition partner to remain relevant. But has Dahal even proved to be a reliable coalition partner? Let’s take a closer look. After Baidya split the party in 2012, the CPN-Maoist was reduced to the third position in the second Constituent Assembly elections, a significant loss from its commanding majority in the first CA. In the following two years, Dahal’s party was not only kept out of power but also forced to endorse a constitution that the Nepali Congress and rival communist party CPN-UML tabled. Having lost the capacity to dictate the political course, Dahal resorted to coalition politics. When the opportunity came, he supported UML’s Khadga Prasad Oli to cobble up a coalition government in October 2015. However, when the Nepali Congress offered him to lead a new coalition, he abandoned Oli and became Prime Minister in 2016. With the 2017 elections on the horizon, Dahal knew his party would not be able to compete with the larger parties that had successfully led the constitution drafting. With some active external mediation, Dahal persuaded Oli for an electoral alliance and even agreed to an eventual unification of the communist forces. When the left unity won a landslide victory, Dahal was convinced that Oli would honour the agreement to hand over power to him mid-way through the four-year period. When Oli refused, he split the united CPN in 2020, convincing several disgruntled leaders like Madhav Nepal to abandon the party and join a coalition with the Nepali Congress. The new coalition also offered Dahal and his party a comfortable division of electoral seats in the 2022 local, provincial and federal elections. But soon after the elections were over, Dahal bargained for power with both Deuba and Oli. Despite having won only 32 seats in the federal parliament with only 11 percent popular vote, Dahal managed to become Nepal’s 33rd Prime Minister in December 2022.Impending downfallIn 2014, political analyst CK Lal had told me that Dahal’s political opportunism would make him relevant in Nepali politics for at least another decade. The Nepali Congress and the CPN-UML took exactly a decade to realise that Dahal had been cashing in on Nepal’s fractured politics. This week, the two parties agreed that Nepal’s long-term political stability requires an introspection into the present electoral system, which allows electorally less popular outfits to dictate the course of national politics. So, not only have the two large parties decided to pull the plug on the Dahal government, but they also agreed to form an independent commission to study and propose amendments to the current electoral provision.While there is little disagreement that the current electoral system paved the way for more representation of the hitherto marginalised sections, the opportunity to correct inefficacies like expensive election campaigning and manipulation of the proportional candidacy lists by the parties must not be dismissed either. There are also serious doubts about the intention of the two parties to strike a deal at a time when the Nepal Police and the Commission for the Investigation of Abuse of Authority are investigating some high-profile corruption cases. It is up to the two parties to vindicate their intent by ensuring that the new political course does not interfere in these investigations. And even if the two parties agree to amend the constitutional provisions regarding elections, they will need to gather a national consensus or at least a two-thirds majority. Whatever happens in the next few weeks and months, it is evidently clear Pushpa Kamal Dahal’s eventual political downfall is on the horizon. \nIn 2019-20, Nepal imported 236 units of passenger electric vehicles (EVs) from China worth some Rs674 million. In the past five years, imports of EVs from China jumped 35 times, suggesting EV adoption in Nepal is now outpacing that of conventional combustion vehicles which use engines that burn fossil fuels, such as petrol or diesel. The EVs have overtaken conventional combustion vehicles.The imports of fossil fuel-consuming passenger vehicles were 10,310 units worth Rs9.24 billion in 2019-20. After four years, in the first 11 months of the current fiscal year, imports of conventional combustion vehicles were down to 3,537 units worth Rs4.21 billionHowever, overall vehicle imports have jumped from Rs65.02 billion in 2019-20 to Rs80 billion in the first 11 months of 2023-24.According to the Department of Customs, Nepal imported 11,466 units of EVs worth Rs29 billion in the first 11 months of the current fiscal year, or by mid-June. The imports were 3,870 units worth Rs11.23 billion in the same period last fiscal year. Of the total EV imports, a third came from China. Customs data show that Nepal imported 7,931 units of EVs from China, accounting for 69 percent of the total EV imports in the first 11 months of the current fiscal year. This translates to Rs21 billion in value.After China, the majority of EVs were imported from India. In the review period, imports from India amounted to Rs6 billion, or 3,277 units. Until the last fiscal year, India was Nepal’s top EV supplier.The data show that Nepal imported 2,205 EVs worth Rs5.94 billion from India in the last fiscal year. In the same period, imports from China were 1,269 units worth Rs3.75 billion.Nepal’s imports of EVs jumped sharply by 158.23 percent in the first 11 months of the current fiscal year. Importers say BYD, a Chinese multinational, has taken over the Nepali market. The government collected revenue of Rs13.06 billion from the import of EVs in the review period.Akash Golchha, senior vice president of the Nepal Automobile Dealers Association, said the ongoing economic slowdown has not stopped Nepalis from buying EVs. However, petrol or diesel-run vehicle sales could have been better.EV sales and orders saw a dramatic surge before the budget was announced on May 28. Cimex Inc Pvt Ltd, the authorised distributor of BYD Auto Industry Co Ltd in Nepal, said it had achieved a milestone by delivering 50 cutting-edge BYD EVs in a single day on May 18. According to the company, all 50 units were sold from its service centre at Guheshwari, Kathmandu.According to Cimex, the company imported 4,000 EVs in the first 11 months of the current fiscal year. The import of Chinese EVs is high due to their larger production compared to India, said the company, which is among the top EV brands in Nepal.BYD’s Atto and Dolphin are the most preferred models among Nepali customers. With the recent hike in excise and customs duties, the company said the new price list of BYDs will be unveiled soon.“There was fear among buyers that the government may raise duty on EVs in the budget. As a result, the demand surged dramatically,” said Golchha. “The high import increased the stock of EVs.”Automobile dealers said that the government hiked the duty on EVs by 10 percent in the budget for the coming fiscal year 2024-25, which, however, may not impact the sales.Golchha said the government did not make drastic changes in the import duty of EVs in the budget, which may help EV sales boom in the coming days. “The EV demand will grow at a faster pace.”Auto dealers say the import boost for EVs is mainly due to banks’ easy financing. Banks lend up to 90 percent of the vehicle’s cost.Finance Minister Barsha Man Pun, in the annual budget for the upcoming fiscal year, revised the customs and excise duty rates on the import of EVs. The customs duty on EVs of up to 50 kW has been increased to 15 percent from 10 percent, while a 5 percent excise duty has been imposed on them.Likewise, the government increased the customs and excise duties on EVs of 50-100 kW by 5 percent. As per the revised tariffs, the customs duty has been increased to 20 percent from 15 percent, while the excise duty has been increased to 15 percent from 10 percent.The customs duty on 100-200 kW has been raised to 30 percent from 20 percent. Similarly, those in categories 200-300 kW and more than 300 KW will be subject to customs duty of 60 percent and 80 percent, respectively. In these vehicles, the indirect tax has been raised by 20 percent each.According to EV traders, the market is flooded with various EV models, features, and looks, and customers have options to select according to their needs. They said that EVs ranging from Rs4 million to Rs5.5 million have a large customer base, while high-priced EVs are also seeing good sales.EV traders said that despite the market slowdown, the EV sector has not been affected.“One interesting emerging trend is that people who already own conventional combustion vehicles are also buying EVs,” said Golchha. \nDespite the Finance Minister's claim of Nepal's complete road network connectivity, Humla district remains disconnected due to the lack of a bridge over the Karnali river, resulting in high costs, transportation challenges, and inflated prices.\nIn an interview, Pyakuryal, a PhD holder in Public Affairs, analyzes Nepal's political stability, narratives, patriarchy, and emerging trends.\nKey events unfold as characters confront challenges, make choices, and navigate conflicts, ultimately leading to significant outcomes or changes.\nCrucial events unfold, shaping destinies and altering the course of history.\nSri Lanka's rich culture, natural resources, and tourist destinations make it an attractive destination, despite the recent financial crisis, which is now improving due to increased tourism.\nPushpa Kamal Dahal secured the vote of confidence in four consecutive tries after becoming the prime minister on December 25, 2022, but when he goes for his fifth on Friday, he is almost sure to fail.After CPN-UML, the largest coalition partner, withdrew its support to the government on July 3, Prime Minister Dahal has been leading the minority government.Soon after the UML withdrew its support, the Janata Samajbadi Party, led by Ashok Rai, also pulled the plug on the government. The CPN-UML has 77 seats and the newly formed Rai-led party has 7 seats in the House of Representatives.Dahal on July 5 decided to go for the floor test after the UML’s withdrawal of the support.Dahal opted for the floor test in accordance with Article 100(2) of the constitution which says, “If the political party which the prime minister represents is divided or a political party in coalition government withdraws its support, the prime minister shall table a motion in the House of Representatives for a vote of confidence within thirty days.”Dahal, who had the support of 268 lawmakers in his first attempt at a floor test, is likely to see that vote slashed by almost 200 this time.As things stood on Thursday, Dahal is most likely to get 32 votes from his CPN (Maoist Centre), 21 from the Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP) and 10 from the CPN (Unified Socialist).The parliamentary party meeting of Unified Socialist on Thursday decided to give Prime Minister Dahal the trust vote.Though the RSP has called a meeting of its parliamentary party on Friday morning, a party lawmaker said, “Since we have been continuing in the government despite being in a minority, we are morally bound to give the vote of trust to Prime Minister Dahal.”On July 4, RSP leaders had announced they’d quit the government but ministers from the party met the prime minister later that day and decided not to resign immediately. They said they backtracked on their plan after the prime minister sought their support until the floor test.To secure a majority in the 275-strong House, one needs 138 votes.The Congress and the UML, which have 88 and 77 House of Representatives seats, respectively, have already decided to vote against Prime Minister Dahal. Likewise, the Rastriya Prajantra Party, which has 14 seats, has also decided to vote against Dahal.The Janata Samajbadi Party Nepal, led by Upendra Yadav, and the Janata Samajbadi Party, led by Ashok Rai, which have 5 and 7 seats, respectively, have said they will vote against Dahal.The Loktantrik Samajbadi Party, which has four seats in the House, is also standing against Dahal during the floor test. “Our party is a member of the democratic alliance led by the Nepali Congress,” Ram Parkash Chaudhary, a lawmaker of the party, told the Post. “Therefore, we will vote against Prime Minister Dahal.”Dahal also will not get the trust vote of the Nagarik Unmukti Party. “Since our party has already withdrawn support to the Dahal government, our party will stand against him during the floor test,” Ranjita Shrestha, a lawmaker of the party, told the Post.The CK Raut-led Janamat Party, which has six seats in the lower house, will also stand against Prime Minister Dahal. “The party has already decided to stand against Prime Minister Dahal’s trust motion,” Abdul Khan, a lawmaker of the party, said.After the November 2022 election, Dahal, chief of the third-largest party in the House, continuously led the government for over one-and-a-half years exploiting the support of both the Congress and the UML, by turn. During this period, the UML backed Dahal two times while the Congress supported him once to form the government.Dahal first became the prime minister with the UML’s support. But the Congress was bent on breaking the UML-Maoist alliance and supported him in the vote of confidence after his swearing-in.After that, Dahal and Deuba started hobnobbing. When Dahal decided to support Congress candidate Ramchandra Paudel in the presidential election, the UML withdrew its support to the Dahal government on February 26, 2023.When Dahal faced the second floor test on March 20, he secured 172 votes in the House.Dahal, during the second trust vote, was supported by the Congress, Rastriya Swatantra Party, Janata Samajbadi Party Nepal (before the party split), Unified Socialist, Janamat Party, Loktantrik Samajbadi Party, Nagarik Unmukti Party, three independent lawmakers and a lawmaker of Rastriya Janamorcha.On March 4, Dahal broke its coalition with the Congress to join hands with the UML. He then went for the floor test for the third time on March 13.In his third floor test, Dahal received 157 votes from the UML, RSP, Janata Samajbadi Party, Unified Socialist, and Nagarik Unmukti Party, in addition to his own party.Meanwhile, Dahal again went for the floor test on May 20, for the fourth time, just two months after his third attempt. This time, he had to seek the parliament’s confidence after a group of seven lawmakers from his coalition partner Janata Samajbadi Party Nepal split the party and formed a new outfit under Ashok Rai’s leadership on May 5.After the party split, JSP-Nepal chair Upendra Yadav withdrew its support to the government. In the subsequent floor test, Dahal garnered 157 votes.Out of 12 political parties in the House of Representatives, along with the first and second largest parties—the Congress and the UML—other 10 parties and five independent lawmakers supported Dahal when he sought a vote of trust for the first time after the 2022 election.In the hung parliament, there are only two scenarios to form the government. Either the Congress and the UML should come together, or one of them should build the majority with the support of other fringe parties to form the government.This time, the Congress and the UML decided to forge a partnership despite the odds. As per the understanding between the two parties, UML chief KP Sharma Oli will lead a ‘national consensus government’ for a year and a half. After that, Sher Bahadur Deuba, the Congress president, will succeed him for the remaining term of the House. \nIt has been over a week since the Nepali Congress and CPN-UML agreed to form a new government under the leadership of the CPN-UML chair KP Oli, but they have yet to settle the ministry-wise portfolio division.Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal, who lost his majority after the UML and other parties withdrew their support, will face a vote of confidence on Friday as required by the constitution. This will be Dahal’s fifth floor test since becoming the prime minister in December 2022. It is almost certain that he will not secure the majority, which means President Ram Chandra Poudel will have to call for the formation of a new government. As soon as the prime minister fails the vote, Speaker Devraj Ghimire will inform President Poudel of the results. The UML is planning to claim the formation of the new government with the support of over two-thirds of the lawmakers, a central committee member of the party told the Post.But it is not clear whether the President will appoint Oli as the next prime minister after the UML submits the signature of the two-thirds lawmakers or he will give political parties one to three days to form a new government under Article 76 (3).President Poudel is consulting his team as well as his advisors, said an aide.As per the initial power-sharing agreement between Deuba and Oli, Congress will get 11 ministries and the UML will get 10. But as more parties have decided to extend support to Oli, they will need to accommodate other fringe parties in the government.Despite these preparations, the Congress and the UML have yet to finalise their nominees for ministers. Oli is likely to be sworn in on Tuesday once the prime minister election process is completed. Sources citing an informal agreement between the two parties said the Congress will lead the home and foreign affairs ministries, and the UML finance and defence ministries.“We are lobbying for General Secretary Gagan Thapa to lead the Congress team in the new government,” Bishwa Prakash Sharma, another general secretary of the party, told the Post. Thapa is interested to lead the Ministry of Home Affairs, but Congress chief Sher Bahadur Deuba wants Ramesh Lekhak as the new home minister, according to Congress leaders. “If Thapa leads another ministry, but is given the position of deputy prime minister, he should join the government,” said Sharma.Dozens of lawmakers have expressed their intent to become ministers this time, so the party’s leadership, including Deuba, is in a difficult situation regarding whom to send and whom not to.Deuba's spouse, Arzu Rana, is widely expected to be the next foreign minister. Other potential Congress ministers include Chandra Bhandari, Jeevan Pariyar, Tejulal Chaudhary, and Ajay Chaurasiya, among others. Besides Thapa, senior Nepali Congress leaders like Prakash Man Singh and Krishna Prasad Situala, among others, are also interested in leading the party in the new Cabinet, according to sources. General Secretary Sharma, however, told the Post that he would not join the new government. Singh, due to his senior position inside the party and the support he had extended in the past to help Deuba win the party presidency, has a high chance of leading the Congress team in the government, if General Secretary Thapa does not join the government, according to Nepali Congress leaders. Thapa has reportedly set some conditions, including deputy prime ministership, for him to lead the party’s team in the Oli Cabinet.Although Sharma claimed that they would lobby for Thapa, Thapa himself, speaking at a function in Biratnagar on Thursday, said he would not join the new government.“I have told the party leadership that I will work as general secretary and not join the government,” said Thapa.He also claimed that as soon as the process of forming the new government begins, the seven-point agreement signed between Oli and Deuba at midnight of July 1 will be made public.“We will discuss with the party president on Friday about sending the Congress team in the government under Thapa’s leadership,” said Sharma. However, UML chief Oli, who is all set to become the new prime minister, is reportedly against having the deputy prime minister portfolio this time. That is one major reason why the two parties have been unable to finalise the portfolio division.If the post of deputy prime minister remains, UML’s Bishnu Poudel, who previously served in that role, might be appointed deputy prime minister and finance minister, according to UML leaders. However, Oli is not keen on bringing Poudel into the Cabinet, according to the leaders. Padma Aryal, UML's party secretary, said a secretariat meeting of the party on Wednesday had already entrusted Oli with selecting ministers.There is also a long list of aspirants in the UML hoping to become ministers in the new Oli Cabinet. If the deputy prime minister portfolio is removed, Oli is likely to pick Rishikesh Pokhrel as the next finance minister, according to the leaders. Pokhrel is the chairman of the Public Account Committee of the House of Representatives. \nAs the parliamentary special probe committee formed to investigate the crisis-ridden cooperatives started discussion with cooperative victims, most of the representatives invited at the committee demanded investigations into Gorkha Media Network chairman GB Rai and then managing director Rabi Lamichhane, who is now deputy prime minister and home minister.Though the committee had invited victims from various cooperatives, most of those who shared their grievances at the parliamentary probe panel’s meeting on Wednesday spent most of their time demanding inquiry on the embezzlement of deposits that were rerouted to the media company, according to a member of the parliamentary special committee.Home Minister Lamichhane was managing director of the media company that ran the now-defunct Galaxy 4K Television before he joined politics in June 2022. GB Rai, who is at large, is believed to have fled the country.In its terms of reference (ToR), the committee has divided the cooperatives it has to investigate into two categories. It has listed the 20 cooperatives declared problematic ones by the government’s Crisis-ridden Cooperatives Management Committee in its schedule 1 and nine others including those linked to the Gorkha Media Network in the schedule 2.The committee had planned to first listen to the victims who deposited money in the cooperatives listed in the schedule 1 and then move on to schedule 2.After listening to the cooperative victims’ grievances on Wednesday, the committee members decided to hold discussions on the cooperatives listed in the schedule 2.“Soon, the parliamentary special probe committee will start discussion on the fourth point [that mentions the schedule 2],” Lekh Nath Dahal, a member of the parliamentary special probe committee, told the Post.As per the ToR, the probe panel will conduct a study and make recommendations on resolving legal and institutional issues faced by cooperatives and on regulations, supervision, and transparency of their financial systems.Coordinators of various struggle committees formed by cooperative victims were also present during the discussion. Chair of the parliamentary probe panel, Surya Thapa, a lawmaker from CPN-UML, said that they invited the representatives to listen to their grievances as the victims’ suggestions would be crucial in reaching a conclusion on the matter.Speaking in a discussion with the House committee, Shaligram Duwadi, a victim of Sahara Multi-Purpose Cooperatives from Chitwan, said that Rs510 million was rerouted from the cooperative to the Gorkha Media Network.“We tried to lodge the complaint against Gorkha Media Network with Chitwan Police but they refused to register our complaint after they saw the name of Gorkha Media Network,” Duwadi was quoted as saying by a member of the special probe committee. “Why was the case not registered by Chitwan Police?”Likewise, the committee member said Krishna Pariyar, a cooperative victim of Swarnalaxmi Saving and Credit Cooperative of Kathmandu, also accused Home Minister Lamichhane of abusing state power by not letting him withdraw his money and cash his cheque.“Though the victims of many cooperatives were present in the meeting today [Wednesday], the discussion was more focused on the chairman and managing director of Gorkha Media Network,” said the committee member.According to the committee member, the victims stressed that no matter how powerful these two people [Rai and Lamichhane] are, they should be booked under the law.The parliamentary special probe committee invited representatives from 29 cooperatives mentioned in the ToR but most of those present at the meeting were victims from the cooperatives linked to the media company, according to committee members.“Though victims from other cooperatives were also present at the committee meeting, most of them were those whose money was embezzled by the Gorkha Media Network,” Ishwari Devi Neupane, a probe committee member representing Nepali Congress, told the Post. Listed under schedule 2 of the ToR or linked to the media company are: the Ideal Yamuna Multipurpose Cooperative, the Image Saving and Credit Cooperative, the Sahara Saving and Cooperative, the Samanata Saving and Credit Cooperative, the Sano Paila Saving and Credit Cooperative, the Supreme Saving and Credit Cooperative, the Suryadarshan Saving and Credit Cooperative, the Sumeru Saving and Credit Cooperative and the Swarnalaxmi Saving and Credit Cooperative.Reportedly, money from Butwal-based Supreme Saving and Credit Cooperative, Suryadarshan Saving and Credit and Cooperative of Pokhara, Sahara Saving and Cooperative of Chitwan, Swarnalaxmi Saving and Credit Cooperative of Kathmandu, Sano Paila Saving and Credit Cooperative of Birgunj, and Nepalgunj’s Samantha Saving and Credit Cooperative has been rerouted to the Gorkha Media Network.Before this, the committee held discussions with top government officials including Secretary of the Ministry of Home Affairs Ek Narayan Aryal and Inspector General of Police (IGP) Basanta Bahadur Kunwar, among other officials, on July 4 to discuss the cooperatives under investigation.On the same day, Central Investigation Bureau (CIB) Chief Shyam Gyawali and Crime Investigation Department Chief Tek Bahadur Tamang were also called for the discussion.As per a probe committee member, some committee members grilled IGP Kunwar about his previous statement in the State Affairs and Good Governance Committee. Speaking at the parliamentary committee in the last week of March, the Nepal Police chief had claimed that police had found no evidence of Home Minister Lamichhane’s involvement in cooperative fraud.“When I made the statement in the State Affairs and Good Governance Committee about the home minister, his involvement in the scam had not been disclosed,” a committee member quoted IGP Kunwar as saying at the special committee meeting. Another member of the probe committee, Shishir Khanal, said the IGP said he was not under any pressure to give a statement about Home Minister Lamichhane. Khanal is a lawmaker from the Lamichhane-led Rastriya Swatantra Party.“The IGP said that he spoke on the basis of facts and that no information regarding Home Minister Lamichhane’s involvement in the cooperatives scam had been found till the day he made the statement.”Also, the committee held discussions with chiefs and representatives of various panels formed since 1990 to probe irregularities in the cooperative sector.The parliamentary special panel will make recommendations on safeguarding depositors’ savings, and quick and easy refunds for victims whose deposits have been embezzled.The panel also agreed to probe crisis-ridden cooperatives and fast-track the refund process for the depositors of the cooperatives concerned.The parliamentary special probe committee began its work a month ago after a month-long discussion with top officials from government agencies as well as chiefs and members of various panels formed so far by the government to look into problems involving cooperatives. \nPrime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal has said that CPN-UML Chairman KP Sharma Oli had hatched a conspiracy against him and the government and joined hands with the Nepali Congress to form a new coalition by dismantling the UML-Maoist Centre alliance prematurely.The four-month-long partnership between Dahal and Oli collapsed after the UML chief sealed a yet-to-be-disclosed seven-point agreement with Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba on the midnight of July 2. Speaking at a meeting of the Maoist Centre’s parliamentary committee on Wednesday, the embattled prime minister accused Oli of betraying him. After the UML recalled its ministers from the Dahal Cabinet and withdrew its support to the government, Dahal is seeking the vote of confidence in the House of Representatives on Friday.“Oli betrayed me for no reason,” said Dahal. “We came to know that the Nepali Congress and the UML were inching towards a political deal but Oli lied to me several times about it.”On the morning of July 2, Dahal and Oli had a three-hour-long conversation at his residence in Baluwatar but Oli did not tell him the truth about what he had agreed with Deuba. “If you are going to become the prime minister with the support of Nepali Congress, I will quit and help you,” Dahal shared with the party’s lawmakers about what he had told Oli. But Oli had flatly denied having reached an agreement with the Congress, according to Maoist leaders.Hitraj Pandey, the chief whip of the Maoist Centre, quoted Dahal as saying that Oli did not want to inform him about the deal with Deuba. According to Congress and UML leaders, Deuba, Oli and second rank leaders of both parties had met regularly for months ahead of the July 2 deal.After second-rank leaders worked out the fundamentals of the new political deal and power-sharing, Deuba and Oli gave it a final touch at midnight on July 2 at the residence of a businessman.Dahal and Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Home Affairs Rabi Lamichhane have been claiming that after the arrest of Bechan Jha in the fake Bhutanese refugee case, Deuba and Oli joined forces in order to protect some of their close aides and family members. According to Nepal Police officials, Jha, who claimed to be an influential power broker, had established good connections with top Congress and UML leaders. Citing their initial findings of interrogation with other suspects they had arrested, police said individuals had given millions of rupees to Jha to facilitate their travel to the United States on the guise of Bhutanese refugees. Some of the accused who masterminded the fake Bhutanese refugee scam are in police custody. Jha’s arrest made the Congress and UML leaders fearful of being arrested, said the Maoist and Swatantra Party leaders. Briefing his party’s lawmakers, Dahal said that he then telephoned Deuba to know what exactly had happened between them. Deuba’s reply was that he and Oli had already reached a deal. He reportedly turned down Dahal's offer to lead the government, according to Pandey.But UML leaders, including their general secretary Shankar Pokhrel, Deputy General Secretary Pradeep Gyawali and others, claimed that after Dahal returned from New Delhi, he started negotiations for new government formation with Deuba and offered him the leadership of a national government.“After we came to know that the prime minister was hatching a conspiracy and going to destabilise the country's politics by changing the ruling partners, we decided to initiate talks with the Congress for the sake of forming a stable government, giving people hope and amending some constitutional provisions,” UMl leaders said. Dahal returned from New Delhi on June 10 after attending the swearing-in ceremony of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.Dahal is seeking a vote of confidence on Friday. On Wednesday, the Nagarik Unmukti Party also decided to withdraw the support extended to the Dahal government. The government has already been reduced to a minority after the UML pulled the plug on it last week.“We will talk to all political parties and seek their support,” said Pandey, the Maoist Centre chief whip. The prime minister will mull his resignation only after the vote of trust in the House, said Pandey. Dahal, who was elected prime minister as per Article 76 (2) of the constitution, claims that the next government will be formed as per Article 76 (3) of the constitution. If the President upholds the spirit of the constitution, he should call for new government formation as per Article 76 (3), Pandey said. \nIn a bid to lessen the spread of the dengue virus during the ongoing monsoon season, the Kathmandu Metropolitan City has decided to continue the drive to destroy mosquito larvae and breeding grounds. Officials at the health department of the city office said on Friday that they have just completed a week-long drive in all 32 wards of the metropolis and plan to continue these efforts in the coming days as well.“Every Wednesday, our health volunteers will visit households and open spaces to destroy mosquito breeding grounds,” said Rishi Bhusal, epidemic prevention and control focal person at the metropolis. “Decisions on preventive measures including launching search and destroy drives will depend on the spread of virus and intensity of rainfall in the coming days.”Dengue is a viral disease transmitted by female Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes. The same vectors also transmit chikungunya, yellow fever, and Zika virus, according to the World Health Organisation.According to data provided by the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division, at least 1,268 people from 72 districts have been infected with the dengue virus since January this year. Among the 72 districts that reported dengue outbreaks, Kathmandu has the highest number of cases: 141. Public health experts say reported cases could be just the tip of the iceberg, as around 80 percent of those infected are asymptomatic. Many people infected with dengue show mild symptoms and can be treated with paracetamol at home.Dengue symptoms include mild to high fever, severe muscle pain, rashes, severe headache, and pain in the eyes. Patients with these symptoms are advised to seek immediate treatment. While there is no specific cure for the disease, early detection and proper medical care can prevent death.Nepal reported its first dengue case in a foreigner in 2004 in the Chitwan district. Since then, an increasing number of dengue infections have been reported from many districts, including major dengue outbreaks. Last year, at least 20 persons died, and more than 52,000 were infected by the virus, which had spread to all 77 districts.In 2022, a total of 88 people died, and over 54,000 were infected by the virus across the country. During that period, hospitals in the Kathmandu Valley were overwhelmed with dengue patients, and pharmacies ran out of paracetamol, the most widely used medicine to treat fever.In 2019, the disease killed at least six people and more than 16,000 were hospitalised across the country. The virus had spread to 68 districts at the time.Though the post-monsoon period is considered the dengue epidemic season, the deadly disease has already become endemic in Nepal, as outbreaks of the virus are reported every month, including in the winter months.Officials at the health department said that 654 health workers, including female community health volunteers, were deployed in the week-long campaign, which concluded on Friday.“Volunteers and health workers who were deployed to the door-to-door campaign checked the mosquito breeding grounds and the larvae, made people aware about the risks and destroyed the breeding grounds,” said Bhusal. Health workers reported that storage places for scrap materials, discarded cups, and plastic in open spaces, and unused lands as potential hotspots for the dengue virus in the coming days. Health workers have warned owners of these sites that action will be taken if mosquito larvae are found against the owner of the storage place if mosquito larvae were found.Dengue-transmitting mosquitoes breed in clean water and bite people in daylight. Uncovered water tanks and discarded objects, such as plastic cups and bottles, could be breeding grounds for these mosquitoes.Public health experts say now is the right time to prepare for and prevent possible outbreaks. Health ministry officials said they have alerted all related agencies to the risk of a dengue outbreak. \nThe Kathmandu Metropolitan City has imparted mental health screening training to doctors and paramedics serving at urban health promotion centres.Officials at the Health Department in the metropolis hope that the move will help hundreds of patients with mental health issues in the city to get timely treatment.“Getting free treatment for mental health problems comes under the right to get free basic health care services,” said Sajina Maharjan, acting head of the department. “Mental health problem screening training to doctors and paramedics will help in the timely diagnosis of the problems and start of early treatment.”At least 32 doctors serving at the urban health promotion centres under the city office and dozens of paramedics participated in five-day screening training. The metropolis has upgraded its urban health clinics to urban health promotion centres and started providing services through medical doctors. “Due to the lack of doctors at our urban health promotion centres, patients suffering from mental health problems have been deprived of timely treatment,” said Nali Bajracharya, a senior public health officer at the department. “Now patients having mental health issues and seeking care at our health centres will also get mental health treatment.”Though neither the federal government agency nor the city office has data on the number of people suffering from mental health problems in the metropolis, doctors estimated that a lot of people could be suffering from various forms of mental health problems—anxiety, depression and others.Officials say that they are also planning to provide free medication to patients with mental health problems.Health workers say that many city dwellers, despite having mental health problems, do not seek treatment and instead turn to drugs and substances to cope. Due to the entrenched social stigma, fear of discrimination and other factors, many patients in Nepal do not talk about their mental health issues.The general tendency among people to conceal mental health issues due to the stigma attached to it has also forced patients to opt for substance abuse, doctors say.They say that while drugs and alcohol may provide temporary relief from stress, they are not a solution and can adversely affect mental health and well-being in the long run.“Treatment in the initial stage of mental illness helps patients achieve better results. For that, early diagnosis is crucial,” said Dr Pomawati Thapa, chief of the Non-communicable Disease and Mental Health Section at the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division. “Other local units should also follow the initiative to provide mental health screening training to health workers, including doctors.”Nepal is among the countries with highest rates of suicide, which is an extreme manifestation of a mental health problem.According to Nepal Police data, 6,993 people took their own lives in the fiscal year 2022-2023. This accounts for more than 19 deaths on average daily. Fifty-six percent of those who die by suicide are men.Doctors say that people do not attempt suicide for a single reason, but due to a complex situation arising from multiple problems.An increasing number of people are struggling with mental problems owing to the rising cost of living and the struggle to manage even their most basic needs, such as food, housing, healthcare and jobs, experts say.Whatever the cause, suicides and suicide attempts have a ripple effect, impacting families, friends, colleagues, communities and societies, doctors say.A study carried out by the Nepal Health Research Council in the past shows that about 13 percent of Nepalis suffer from some form of mental disorder. This means around one in eight Nepalis has mental health issues. Moreover, the country simply does not have enough experts to treat mental health problems, it added.Studies show the magnitude of suffering, the burden and costs for individuals, families and societies arising from mental health disorders are alarming in Nepal.“No doubt, mental health problems have been emerging as a major cause of morbidity and mortality in our country,” said Thapa. “All local governments must take initiative to address the problems. Only the federal government agencies cannot do much.”The World Health Organisation says that one in four people in the world has been affected by mental or neurological disorders at some point in their lives, and around 450 million people currently suffer from such conditions, placing mental disorders among the leading causes of ill health and disability worldwide. \nDuring the 2022 local level election, people of Kathmandu elected independent candidate Balendra Shah as their mayor for five years. Sunita Dangol of the CPN-UML secured the position of KMC deputy mayor in the same election. When they began their term, many suspected that the two—an independent mayor and his party-affiliated deputy—wouldn’t have cordial relations. But, in the last two years of their term, there has been no visible disagreement between them. They proved their sceptics wrong.Deputy Mayor Dangol kept mum when Mayor Shah accused her party chair, KP Sharma Oli, of policy corruption in the Giri Bandhu Tea Estate land scam.Moreover, Shah expressed his anger on June 3 over the government’s intervention in his plan to widen pavements in the New Road area. Deputy Prime Minister Raghubir Mahaseth of the UML leads the Ministry of Physical Infrastructure and Transport, which maintains major roads.After the ministry intervened in the municipal plan to expand the sidewalk on New Road, Shah took to social media and wrote, “Honourable KP Oli jyu, don’t hoodwink people by engineering yet another scam to hide a scam of Rs10,000 crore [Rs100 billion].”He further added, “You have reassured those who had made advance payments to buy land of Giri Bandhu Tea Estate that they would get the land within two years.” “If one looks at the policy corruption in the tea estate, it appears not a single leaf would stir without Oli’s nod,” Shah wrote.A few days prior to the incident, Mayor Shah had engaged in a heated debate with Chinkaji Maharjan, a UML member and chairman of KMC’s ward 22, over the sidewalk expansion plan.Dangol remained quiet on the issue thus far. However, at the city council meeting on Monday, which also discussed KMC's policies and programmes for the fiscal year 2024-25, she criticised Mayor Shah for his remarks.“This should be the first time the deputy mayor opposed the public behavior and statement of the mayor,” a Kathmandu ward chairperson told the Post on the condition of anonymity.Dangol had her initial plan to contest the mayor position independently but the UML gave her the deputy mayor’s ticket.Speaking during the Monday discussion, Deputy Mayor Dangol said, addressing Mayor Shah, “Your and mine voices are being heard and watched by Nepalis worldwide. Therefore, those of us who want to come to politics should think about our expression,” Dangol remarked. “We should maintain the image and dignity of the institution we represent.”She also emphasised the need to accommodate the voices of everyone in an undertaking.Though the representatives of Kathmandu Metropolitan City claim that Dangol's Monday statement was unusual, they deny any rift between the two leaders of the local government. “City council’s is an internal meeting of the KMC where various issues arise. We settle those issues internally,” Nabin Manandhar, the KMC spokesperson and ward 17 chairman from the Nepali Congress, told the Post. “Having an opinion does not necessarily mean criticism.”Rajesh Kumar Shrestha, chair of KMC ward 19, seconded Manandhar.However, local representatives of Kathmandu have been questioning Shah for his ‘lone-wolf’ manner of leading the institution.“We should develop a working relationship that welcomes everyone’s spirit,” Dangol told the council meeting. “If one thinks they are in a position and everything should be done as they say, it will only lead to trouble.”She added, “While working in a team, we definitely have a different opinion, but different opinions should be respected.”At the meeting, referring to Mayor Shah's past statements, council member Anita Karki asked him, saying, “What if the voters of Kathmandu set ablaze the Durbar where the KMC office lies?”In September last year, when the traffic police obstructed a KMC vehicle, later known to be used by his postpartum wife, Mayor Shah provocatively wrote on Facebook, threatening to burn Singha Durbar, the federal government’s central secretariat.Traffic police, under the federal government, had stopped the vehicle to check necessary documents on a Saturday.After the incident, Shah wrote on social media warning that if the government blocked KMC's vehicles again, he would set fire to Singha Durbar.Dangol said on Monday that she believed it was wrong to write on social media or make a statement inciting people to burn the Singha Durbar or the Bagh Durbar, where the KMC office is situated.Dangol, speaking at the city council meeting, also said there should be no polarisation between the representatives who were elected to develop Kathmandu. \nA police officer was found dead on the premises of the federal parliament building in Baneshwar, Kathmandu on Wednesday.According to Ekram Giri, spokesperson for the federal parliament secretariat, Ajit Gole of Dolakha committed suicide by shooting himself.The body of the victim was recovered from the parliament building’s washroom.Dinesh Mainali, spokesperson for the Kathmandu Metro Police Range, said Gole, who was on duty from 6am to 10am, was found dead at around 8 in the morning. “A constable of Nepal Police was found dead inside a toilet of the parliament building,” Mainali told the Post. “Preliminary investigation shows he was inflicted with a gunshot.”Nepal police said the investigation is underway. \nPolice on Friday arrested two people from Thimi of Bhaktapur for allegedly mining cryptocurrency.The Central Investigation Bureau took 50-year-old Biswas Gurung and Rajendra Tahamata, 25, into custody in connection with the crime, said Hobindra Bogati, spokesperson for the bureau.The duo allegedly ran mining operations from the CTEVT’s information technology lab using a server and 64 desktops, on which blockchain applications were found during a preliminary investigation. Further investigation into the matter is underway. \nAmid an economic slowdown, the banking sector is looking for a slightly loose monetary policy to boost the confidence of the financial and private sectors, including individuals. The banking sector expects favourable working capital guidelines, which will open avenues for the financial industry and traders to increase their economic activities. In this context, the Post’s Krishana Prasain caught up with Upendra Prasad Poudel, chairman of Nabil Bank, to discuss the economy and the banking sector amid Nepal’s ballooning foreign exchange reserves and slowed lending. Excerpts:The monetary policy is due soon. What are the expectations of the banking industry?Our expectations from monetary policy are high as the country’s economy is going through a challenging situation. Some people say the economy is in crisis. But I don't call it a crisis because the external sector, including key economic indicators, is doing well. The country’s economy is looking for a boost—confidence where it will be easy for everyone to work in tandem. Our economic base is small. It will not take a long time for the economy to revive. In that background, we need a loose monetary policy to address everyone's needs.A loose monetary policy aims to stimulate economic activity and reduce unemployment by lowering interest rates and increasing the money supply. Without a loose monetary policy, building the private sector confidence is difficult. Liquidity is sufficient. To increase the credit demand, there is a need to boost consumption. To increase consumption, people need to have enough cash in their hands. That demands government and private sector investments. This depends on both fiscal and monetary policies. For instance, the construction sector is facing trouble, and as a result, there is not much economic activity with the government failing to pay the contractors. When contractors are not getting money, they are not giving it to workers. So the money is not reaching the people. As a result, consumption has remained stagnant. The government is not giving subsidies to agriculture or the insurance sector. We learn that the government needs more money. The private sector no longer trusts the government’s fiscal policy. In contrast, since the banking sector is regulated and disciplined, everyone looks up to monetary policy. Naturally, the private sector has high expectations from the central bank. What kind of policies are needed to revive the economy? As I said, public consumption needs to grow. To boost consumption, there is a need to increase credit. In the past, the banking sector made aggressive lending, but the credit did not go into the real economy or the productive sector. So, the central bank and commercial banks are now worried. Even though credit has seen a growth lately, the impact is not visible. At one level, the money needs to reach everyone's hands. So monetary policy needs to encourage credit flow. There is a slowdown in the banking industry, too. Banks are not able to offer dividends. Positive developments also exist. Interest has been cut, which will reduce capital costs, ultimately increasing output and consumption.Foreign exchange reserves are at a record high. Banks’ lending has yet to improve. What does this show?People are spending less. Reduced spending means that the demand for goods and services has declined. Even though the interest rate has declined, banks struggle to boost credit. As the foreign exchange rate increases, we have the space to increase imports. Banks have liquidity and the capacity to disburse funds. Interest rates are also declining, and the environment is becoming more conducive. But the demand for loans is a must. The confidence in the system must be high for the demand for loans to grow. The International Monetary Fund also indicates that Nepal’s situation may improve in the next fiscal year, depending on the monetary policy. What is sustainable banking? Why are Nepali banks reluctant to follow it?We look at sustainable banking in a futuristic way. We work for days beyond today. We work for tomorrow's generation. We work to make resources available for tomorrow. We must work to make everything sustainable. We have to preserve nature. Banks have gone for short-term profits. That's how we have deviated from sustainability. But our banks still need to go for sustainable practices. The central bank defines the productive sector including energy as the real economy. Investing in those sectors leads to sustainability.Our system ranks banks on the basis of profit, the number of depositors or the volume of loans. In reality, though, to be number one, the parameter should be the impact the bank has on the economy, environment, and society. Knowingly or unknowingly, everyone is talking about sustainable banking. Many banks have started reporting their carbon footprints. Many banks, including Nabil, have started various schemes for agriculture. There are products for women entrepreneurship for inclusive development and migrant workers as well. The banking sector needs to be aware of responsible investment. The central bank has been reinforcing this idea from time to time. How have cooperatives issues affected banks?As the financial system is interlinked, problems in the cooperative sector have impacted the banking sector directly or indirectly. Some cooperative deposits are with banks, and the bank's money has also gone to cooperatives. Not only cooperatives but some credit to loan sharks might have been sourced from banks, too. These are serious issues that need to be tackled prudently. We sense that the problem in the cooperatives sector will shake up the banking sector one day. The banking sector is highly regulated and has the capacity to absorb any shock, though it may not make a profit as before. Regulating cooperatives is difficult now: it’s already too late. The SME sector complains that getting bank loans isn’t easy. What can be done to increase credit flow?We are the custodians of depositors and cannot lend money to anyone easily. We draw a borderline to mitigate possible risk. Lack of financial literacy is still prevailing, and we have been working to create awareness. The financial sector has become transparent, but the private sector hasn’t. The government needs to create an environment that makes businesses transparent. The banks have started taking steps to develop and scale up entrepreneurship. Such initiative needs to be taken by the government, including the local level. The growth in entrepreneurship will stop our youths from going abroad. The government needs to spend heavily on developing entrepreneurship by supporting startups. Nepal has started cross-border digital payment. How has the banking sector started preparation, especially on the operating side?Banks have made a giant leap in terms of digital payment. Certain levels of credit are being approved online. Bank accounts are opened online, and security documents are automatically generated. We have moved ahead in the information and technology systems in the banking sector. However, we are still in the infancy when it comes to the adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) in the banking sector. To make transactions with India more comprehensive, we need support from Indian regulators, especially in preventing illegal transactions. With proper regulations and support, digital payments will boom. \nThe International Monetary Fund (IMF) has warned that Nepal’s economy, still reeling from subdued domestic demand and post‑pandemic balance sheet repairs, may face an increasingly gloomy and uncertain outlook, mainly due to fragile political stability and cooperatives failure.The global lender, which provides policy advice and financing to its members to foster growth and financial stability, said Nepal’s fragile political stability could disrupt policy continuity and reform implementation. Nepal is set to elect the new prime minister next week. Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal is almost certain to fail the trust vote. This will be his fifth trust vote in a year and a half. The CPN-UML withdrew its support to the government on July 3 after it ditched its coalition with the CPN (Maoist Centre) and joined hands with the Nepali Congress to form a new government.This is the fourth time in Nepal’s political history that two major parties are forming a government without a powerful opposition, which observers say weakens democracy's effective functioning.On Tuesday, the IMF completed the fourth review under its four‑year extended credit facility, allowing Nepal to withdraw $41.3 million to help the country's economic recovery.This brings total disbursements under the extended credit facility for budget support to $247.7 million.The IMF executive board approved the extended credit facility arrangement for Nepal on January 12, 2022. The approved amount totals $371.6 million, which is 180 percent of Nepal’s special drawing rights quota (SDR) of 282.42 million.“Nepal’s economy continues to face challenges,” said the statement issued by the IMF on Thursday. It said that Nepal’s growth projected at 3 percent in the fiscal year 2023-24 remains below potential due to subdued domestic demand and post‑pandemic balance sheet repairs. The IMF has talked about Nepal’s cooperatives sector for the first time.In the statement, the IMF warned about the intensification of financial sector vulnerabilities, such as a further rise in non-performing loans. In this context, “more failures of cooperative lenders could endanger the banking system's soundness,” the IMF said.According to experts and bankers interviewed by the Post, cooperatives, which the government once embraced as one of the three pillars of the economy, are now threatening the economy.In Nepal, millions of small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are heavily involved in cooperatives, and their failure could not only damage the fragile economy, but also harm social harmony, say experts. Cooperatives are involved in sectors ranging from dairy and livestock to tailoring and retail.Recently, thousands of victims of cooperatives fraud have staged protests in various parts of the country, demanding the return of deposits embezzled by cooperative operators. Hundreds of such depositors came to Kathmandu and staged protests. The government recently signed an agreement with them, promising to solve their problems as soon as possible.“The problem in the cooperative sector will shake up the banking sector. But if there is a wise move, the banking sector can absorb the shock,” said Upendra Poudyal, president of the Confederation of Banks and Financial Institutions Nepal. He said that the regulation of cooperatives has already been delayed. “We have seen that cooperatives are being operated for personal gains. A limited number of people took the benefit.” “Now, the central bank should begin with a single threshold. Limit the number and start supervision.” As of mid-March, there are 31,450 cooperatives in Nepal, with 7.38 million members. The deposit mobilisation in cooperatives amounted to Rs478 billion, while credit mobilisation stood at Rs405 billion. They currently employ 94,000 people.In a recent interview, Kashi Raj Dahal, immediate past chairman of the Crisis-ridden Cooperatives Management Committee, a government agency, told the Post that globally, most cooperatives work in productive sectors like food production, dairy, fruits and other agricultural activities. “But in Nepal, around 25,000 cooperatives are involved only in financial activities, mainly collecting deposits and issuing loans. Such cooperatives are now in crisis. Over 15,000 are registered to collect deposits. Even others registered as multi-purpose cooperatives primarily engage in savings and credits. Around 500 cooperatives are currently in trouble.”The Dahal-led government has promised the return of at least Rs500,000 to each depositor by recovering it from the directors' assets. Yet doubts persist about whether depositors will get back their money. Some economists have warned about potential mass protests if the cooperatives issue is not taken seriously.The IMF has also warned that the failure to raise the execution rate of large-scale projects would deprive the economy of much-needed stimulus and weigh on growth. On the pessimistic side, the IMF said that economic activity is expected to increase, reaching 4.9 percent in 2024-25, supported by more robust domestic demand. The statement reads that the cautiously accommodative monetary policy stance, the planned increase in capital expenditures in the 2024-25 budget, additional hydropower generation, and a continued rise in tourist arrivals are expected to boost domestic demand and growth. Inflation is expected to remain within the Nepal Rastra Bank’s (NRB) target ceiling of 5.5 percent.“Nepal has made important strides on its economic reform agenda. Decisive actions in monetary policy, bank regulation and rolling off Covid support policies played a major role in overcoming urgent balance of payments pressure in 2021-22,” said Bo Li, deputy managing director of IMF. “Reserves continue to rise without the need to use distortive import restrictions. Despite revenue shortfalls, fiscal discipline was maintained in 2022-23 and 2023-24. Bank supervision and regulation have improved by rolling out new supervisory information systems. Nepal’s medium-term outlook remains favourable as strategic investments in infrastructure, especially in the energy sector, are expected to support potential growth.”The IMF said that strengthening public investment management would support the needed boost to capital spending. Enhancing fiscal transparency will help contain fiscal risks and strengthen medium-term fiscal sustainability.“As monetary policy transmission is still weak in a context of balance sheet repair, a cautious and data-dependent monetary policy remains appropriate to preserve price and external stability,” the IMF said.  \nKot Ghar, once considered the seat of powerful Malla kings of Galkot, a pretty kingdom in the confederation of 24 states known as Chaubisi Rajya, has been restored and preserved to draw tourists.The Kot Ghar means a house where weapons are placed or stored. The town of Galkot once served as the fortress of the hilly kingdom ruled by the Mallas. The historical palace, which has been renovated, offers a reason to visit Galkot.Before the Panchayat era, Galkot served as Baglung's headquarters. Without the administrative offices, the locals seek to make Galkot the tourism headquarters of Baglung.According to history, Jitari Malla, the elder son of King Narayan Malla of Parbat, established Galkot Rajya in 1631 BS.A stone inscription states that Kot Ghar was constructed in 1661 BS. Galkot was free until Jagat Pratap Malla's rule in 1844 BS. The local government has been trying to preserve the historical artefacts to showcase to the visitors. The ancient palace of Galkot was in dire straits because of the lack of conservation.The Shreemeher Gana barracks of the Nepal Army and Galkot municipality have jointly renovated the almost-collapsed Kot Ghar.Professor Din Bahadur Thapa, a historian, said that the state also produced rice during the 10th generation of kings 213 years ago. After that, until 2015 BS, the kings of Galkot remained rulers. After the last king, Bharat Bam Malla, was elected to parliament in the 2015 BS general election, Raja Rajouta stepped down. There is a history of Bharat Bam submitting a proposal to remove Raja Rajauta from the House of Representatives.Thapa's research mentions that the state of Galkot extended to Kathekhola in the east, Pandavakhani in the west, Rum in Myagdi in the north, and Musikot in Gulmi in the south. After the kingdom was taken away, Jagat Pratap Bam Malla moved the palace to Shraddhakhet. The last king, Bharat Bam, built a palace in Harichor Bazar in 1990 BS. The construction started in 1978 BS.Even until 2019 BS, the central administrative units of Baglung were in Galkot. Later, they were shifted to Baglung Bazaar. The Kot Ghar conservation and tourism promotion programme was started five years ago to reflect this legacy. Bir Jung Bhandari, former ward chairman of Galkot Municipality, had started some of the works.Bharat Sharma Gaire, mayor of the municipality, said that the historic city planning and the work to preserve the history had been completed with the help of the Nepal Army.Cannoning infrastructure has also been built at Sahasradhara waterfall near Kot Ghar. Festivals are organised during the Dashain and Chaite Dashain. Hundreds of pilgrims tour these religious sites annually.Locals conduct regular worship. A hundred houses in Kotmaidan village offer worship by taking ownership. It is listed in the city pride project.The weapons in Kot Ghar have been kept separately by making a new home. The doors and windows of Kot Ghar have been modelled on the Bhaktapur craft. On the way to Kot Ghar, a barbed wire fence and railing have been set up.Drainage and culverts have been constructed in some road stretches that reach Kot Ghar from the mid-hill highway. The municipality has been investing yearly to pave the road to Kot Ghar. The location is important from the tourism perspective.Galkot Valley, Ghumte hill, Daram River, and Tara River can be viewed from Kot Ghar. Kalika temple, near Kot Ghar, has also been maintained.Nearly 100 ropanies have been protected through barbed wire fences. The number of tourists visiting Kot Ghar has recently increased with the construction of drinking water taps and resting areas.The association of the former army conducted a district-level annual general meeting in the Kot Ghar area.It is presumed that the state was named Galkot, derived from ‘Golo Kot’, the way the Kot Ghar was built.Kot Ghar, located in Galkot Municipality-3, was the first seat of the kings. Though the king shifted to Harichaur through Shraddakhet, the weapons were kept in Kot Ghar and Kalika temple. Other structures were also built around Kot Ghar. Gaire said the places of historical importance were protected. A six-kilometre road has been built from the mid-hill highway to Kot Ghar.The road to Kot Ghar from the highway was maintained and paved, said Pham Bahadur Khatri, the ward chairman. He said that around Rs1.5 million was spent to renovate Kot Ghar, and the Nepal Army provided Rs900,000 and the human resources. \nIn a bid to support midwives and other healthcare personnel in ensuring safer births in low-resource settings, the Ministry of Health and Population has launched a “safe delivery app”.Officials hope that the mobile application will complement and enhance the ongoing capacity-building of health workers and help in reducing maternal and newborn deaths.“The Safe Delivery App provides up-to-date lifesaving procedures and practical guidance in the local language,” said Dr Bibek Kumar Lal, director of the Family Welfare Division under the Department of Health Services, at the launch of the Nepali version of the Safe Delivery App. “It aims to improve the quality of emergency obstetric and newborn care, and the main users will be our frontline health workers, especially nurses and midwives.”Officials at the division said that the government has collaborated with the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) and the Maternity Foundation (MF) to launch the Nepali version of the widely used digital health tool.Globally, every two minutes, a woman dies. In Nepal, two women die every day due to pregnancy-related complications—most of which are preventable, said Won Young Hong, a UNFPA representative in Nepal. “These are staggering numbers. UNFPA is pleased to work with the concerned stakeholders to localise this digital application so healthcare workers across Nepal can use it.”The Safe Delivery App is an evidence-based learning and training tool designed to support midwives, nurses, and other healthcare professionals to assist during births and to manage the most common complications. Among other features, it contains the latest clinical guidelines, animated instruction videos, descriptions of practical procedures, and action cards. It is free, and once downloaded on a smartphone or a tablet, it works offline, making it possible to be used even in the most remote areas. To date, more than 435,000 healthcare professionals across more than 70 countries have been reached through the Safe Delivery App and the accompanying programme worldwide, with Nepal being the latest country to introduce the App. “We will work with provincial governments and development partners to quickly roll out the App throughout Nepal,” said Lal.Nepal cut the maternal mortality rate from 539 per 100,000 births in 1996 to 239 per 100,000 births in 2016—for which the country even received a Millennium Award. According to the National Statistics Office report, the country has further reduced the number of deaths to 151 per 100,000 births in 2021. Maternal health experts, however, say that even if the country has made good progress in reducing maternal deaths, the current maternal mortality ratio is more than double the Sustainable Development Goals target, which is 70 maternal deaths per 100,000 live births by 2030.Neonatal deaths have not declined between 2016 and 2022, according to the Nepal Demographic and Health Survey-2022 carried out by the Ministry of Health and Population.The government’s target for the Sustainable Development Goals was to reduce neonatal mortality to 16 deaths per 1,000 live births by 2022 and 12 in every 1,000 live births by 2030.The SDGs, a follow-up on the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), aim to end poverty, hunger, and all forms of inequality worldwide by 2030, and Nepal has committed to meeting the goals.The health ministry has been taking several measures to reduce maternal and neonatal deaths, including installing an underfloor heating system at birthing centres, setting up special newborn care units, training doctors, nurses, and paramedics in the district hospitals and distributing non-pneumatic anti-shock garments to prevent maternal deaths from excessive bleeding.Besides, the ministry provides free service and travel allowances for those opting for institutional delivery and antenatal visits. It also distributes misoprostol, a medication used to treat postpartum bleeding in new mothers, through female community health volunteers. \nAs heavy monsoon rains cause chaos across the country, dengue cases are surging in several districts, including Kathmandu.According to the Health Office Kathmandu, around 18 people are infected with the dengue virus every day. Officials, however, admit that this number could be just the tip of the iceberg, as the office gets reports only from 18 health facilities.“Yes, the number of people infected with the dengue virus could be several times higher than suggested by the reports we are getting every day,” said Dr Arjun Sapkota, chief of the Health Office, Kathmandu. “We are working to make daily reporting of dengue cases mandatory for private health facilities as well.”Dengue is a viral disease transmitted by female Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes. The same vectors also transmit chikungunya, yellow fever, and Zika virus, according to the World Health Organisation.According to data provided by the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division, at least 1,432 people from 73 districts have been infected with the virus since January this year. Among the 73 districts that reported dengue outbreaks, Kathmandu has the highest number of cases with 159, followed by Jhapa with 120, Chitwan 83, Makawanpur 65, Tanahun and Doti 49 cases each, and Okhaldhunga and Sindhupalchowk 46 each.Sapkota informed that his office has sensitised the local bodies about the looming risk of a massive dengue outbreak in the coming days.“Mandatory reporting of dengue cases every day is among the preventive measures through which we can identify dengue hotspots,” said Sapkota. “This will help health workers target such measures in particular areas. Additionally, starting this week, we are resuming the “10 minutes at 10 am” initiative every Friday, during which mosquito breeding grounds will be destroyed.”Officials informed that several local units, including the Kathmandu Metropolitan City, have already started preventive measures against dengue. Dengue symptoms include mild to high fever, severe muscle pain, rashes, severe headache, and pain in the eyes. Patients with these symptoms are advised to seek immediate treatment. While there is no specific cure for the disease, early detection and proper medical care can prevent death.Doctors say many people infected with dengue show mild symptoms and can be treated with paracetamol at home.Nepal reported its first dengue case in a foreigner in 2004 in the Chitwan district. Since then, an increasing number of dengue infections, including major outbreaks, have been reported from many districts. Last year, at least 20 persons died, and more than 52,000 were infected by the virus, which had spread to all 77 districts.In 2022, a total of 88 people died, and over 54,000 were infected by the virus across the country. During that period, hospitals in the Kathmandu Valley were overwhelmed with dengue patients, and pharmacies ran out of paracetamol, the most widely used medicine to treat fever.In 2019, the disease killed at least six people and more than 16,000 were hospitalised across the country. The virus had spread to 68 districts at the time.Though the post-monsoon period is considered the dengue epidemic season, the deadly disease has already become endemic in Nepal, as outbreaks are reported every month, including in the winter months.According to health workers, storage places for scrap materials, discarded cups, plastic material tossed in open spaces, and unused lands will be potential hotspots for the dengue virus in the coming days. Health workers have warned the owners of these sites that action will be taken if mosquito larvae are found there.Dengue-transmitting mosquitoes breed in clean water and bite people in daylight. Uncovered water tanks and discarded objects, such as plastic cups and bottles, could be breeding grounds for these mosquitoes. \nWith monsoon havoc sweeping across the country, the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division has urged health workers to avoid taking leave during the season.Officials have warned that health facilities could be overwhelmed by patients in the coming days as outbreaks of waterborne and vector-borne diseases are expected, as floodwaters have contaminated most of the drinking water sources.“We have requested the provincial and local health authorities not to grant leave to health workers during the monsoon season,” said Dr Yadu Chandra Ghimire, director of the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division. “Health agencies have been cautioned about the looming risk of outbreaks of waterborne and vector-borne diseases in the coming days.”Torrential rainfall started Friday wreaking havoc in various places across the country. At least 14 people have died in disaster-related incidents—nine in landslides and five in floods—since Friday, according to the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Authority. Officials said 18 others have been injured, and four people are missing. Since the monsoon entered the country on June 10, at least 43 people have died in landslides and flood-related incidents. Lightning strikes killed as many as 19 people during this period.The monsoon season in Nepal is a time of epidemics during which thousands of people across the country become infected with water-borne and vector-borne diseases.The persistent rainfall that started on Friday not only destroyed houses and inundated settlements but also contaminated drinking water sources.Health officials warned that health facilities could witness an uptick in the number of viral fever cases, and waterborne diseases—diarrhoea, dysentery, food poisoning, and snake bites—in the coming days.“We have also requested central hospitals and medical colleges to be prepared for help during disease outbreaks,” said Ghimire. “As we don’t have enough doctors and health workers to deploy to control the outbreaks, we have to seek help from big hospitals and medical colleges.”Officials at the Ministry of Health and Population said that they have been raising awareness through all available means to inform people of the risks. “Essential medicines have been stockpiled, health workers have been asked to be ready for deployment to affected areas, anti-snake venom has been supplied to health facilities,” said Dr Prakash Budhathoki, spokesperson at the Health Ministry. “As of Sunday evening, no outbreaks have been reported.”According to health experts, sources of drinking water generally become contaminated in disaster-hit areas, and people displaced by natural disasters become highly vulnerable to infections with waterborne and vector-borne diseases. Every year, thousands of people get infected with vector-borne diseases such as dengue, kala-azar, malaria, and scrub typhus during this period. Last year, at least 20 persons died, and more than 52,000 were infected by the virus, which had spread to all 77 districts. According to data provided by the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division, at least 1,432 people from 73 districts have been infected with the dengue virus since January this year. Among the 73 districts that reported dengue outbreaks, Kathmandu has the highest number of cases: 159. Public health experts say reported cases could be just the tip of the iceberg, as around 80 percent of those infected are asymptomatic. Likewise, snakebite incidents and resulting deaths are also common during the season, but the phenomenon, which experts dub “a lurking invisible crisis”, remains grossly neglected. “Incidents of snakebites have started to surge over the last few weeks,” said Dr Rajiv Jha, director at Provincial Health Directorate of Madhesh Province. “Along with the surge in waterborne and vector-borne diseases in the coming days, we have anticipated a rise in snakebite cases.”Doctors say the only ways to prevent deaths from waterborne diseases, including diarrhoea, are to raise awareness and ensure safe drinking water.They say a combination of careful surveys, ensuring safe drinking water, maintaining sanitation and hygiene, social mobilisation and treatment are required to contain the spread of the diarrhoeal infection. \nWith the onset of the rainy season, the incidents of snakebite are on the rise in western Tarai districts.Snakebite treatment centres and hospitals in Kanchanpur and Kailali districts of Sudurpaschim province are now crowded with snakebite patients. Treatment of the snakebite patients, according to health workers, is quite challenging as patients are often brought to the health facilities at the last minute.As many as 60 snakebite patients visited the Snakebite Treatment Centre set up by Nepal Army at Arjuni of Shuklaphanta National Park within the past three weeks. “Over the past one week three to four snakebite patients have been visiting the centre on a daily basis,” said Ratan Bohora, a paramedic at the Arjuni-based Snakebite Treatment Centre. The local residents have hugely benefited after the Nepali Army and the local community jointly established the snakebite treatment centre at Arjuni in 2014. The centre, however, has to refer the patients with serious health conditions to other well facilitated hospitals due to the lack of an intensive care unit (ICU) and ventilator. “Two patients who were bitten by poisonous snakes were referred to Mahakali Provincial Hospital in Mahendranagar this year. We have no alternative but to send serious cases of snakebite to other hospitals due to the lack of the ICU and ventilator facilities,” said Bohora. The centre also does not even have a monitor to track a patient's vital signs such as blood pressure, heart rate and oxygen levels. The flow of the patients is increasing, but the centre only has two paramedics to provide treatment.Incidents of snakebite and resulting deaths are common in Nepal, but the issue still remains grossly neglected as what experts call a lurking ‘invisible crisis’. Each year, around 2,700 people, mostly children and women from Nepal’s Tarai region, die of snakebites, according to a March 2022 report.Most snakebite incidents occur when farmers are transplanting paddy fields or children are playing outdoors. Health workers say that the snakes that live in water are generally less poisonous. “The cases that are most serious occurred at night, often inside houses. Such patients should be taken to hospital immediately,” said Bohora. According to him, people living in thatched-roof houses are especially vulnerable to snakebite, because snakes often enter such homes in search of rats.Nepal is home to around 17 highly venomous snakes. Each year, the country sees about 20,000 to 40,000 cases of snakebite. The numbers could be higher, as many cases of snakebite go unreported, health workers say.Another health challenge in rural Nepal is the superstitious belief in visiting shamans instead of seeking treatment at medical facilities for snakebite. Experts say awareness drives should be launched to educate people that the snakebite patients should be taken to the hospital at the earliest. They recommend promoting cleanliness around homes, preventing children from playing in bushy areas, avoiding nightime walks, and using torchlight while walking in the dark.“Treatment of snakebite patients is possible if they are taken to health facilities on time. Patients are often brought to the hospital only after their condition has worsened, resulting in serious consequences,” said Dr Arjun Bhatta, medical superintendent at Mahakali Provincial Hospital. According to him, 10 snakebite patients with serious health conditions visited the hospital in the past three weeks. “They returned home after treatment,” said Bhatta. \nI can vividly remember my first encounter with baking when I was 10 years old. We had just moved to our new home and got a cable connection. The cable opened a world of possibilities, as it gave me access to various contents.This was back in the late 2000s when YouTube would take hours to load, taunting us with its buffering screen. I was particularly drawn to travel and lifestyle channels, mainly TLC, Fox Life, and Food Network, which kept me informed about different foods and cultures. I don’t know why, but I was always drawn to desserts. It was fascinating to see how these miraculous treats made people smile at the end of the meal.Growing up in Nepal, I noticed that baking wasn't very common. While some families did have ovens, they were mostly multifunctional ones used primarily for heating food.I also noticed that most of our desserts didn't require an oven, as they could be made on a stovetop. So, you can imagine my excitement when my mom decided to buy an oven during one of her festive shopping sprees.I could finally feel the joy these channels portrayed. (I blame food writer Nigella Lawson for getting me hooked on a domestic lifestyle.) Then, one day, after watching one of the cooking episodes on television, I finally mustered enough strength and decided to bake something. I distinctly remember wanting to make a chocolate cake for myself after watching one of Rachel Allen’s bake series. I watched all the ingredients used in that recipe and scurried across my pantry, only to realise I didn’t have half of the stuff she mentioned. I then decided to improvise the recipe (a big mistake). I randomly combined the ingredients that I had in a mixing bowl and chucked the batter into my oven, hoping for a magical cake to pop out an hour later.After I saw the result an hour later, I was mortified. The cake was stuck in the pan, refusing to come out, and it was as dense as fudge. I convinced myself that the taste was what mattered most, but when I served a slice to my brother, he made a face of utter disgust.That was the day I realised that baking soda was not the same as baking powder.After this incident, I researched baking and found out it was technical. This was a blessing in disguise for me, as I loved science, and I started to view baking as a science experiment. I then reflected and evaluated how to perfect one's baking skills.I analysed my errors and noted down all the steps I did every time I baked. Home baking is a passion for many. The idea of turning a few simple ingredients into a delicious masterpiece is as enchanting as it sounds.Yet, for many of us, this seemingly magical process can often turn into a series of unfortunate events, leading to crumbled dreams and deflated ambitions. Dense cakes, burnt crusts, rock-hard cookies and unrisen bread, if you are an amateur baker, then you have seen it all. But why do these mishaps happen so often? And most importantly how do we overcome them?From my experience, behind every successful bake lies a series of challenges and mishaps that test even the most dedicated bakers. Baking has its own set of rules that you need to follow to get that scrumptious treat every time. So, to transform a recipe into an actual dish that will impress your friends and family, I am sharing with you some of the tips and tricks I learned from my tumultuous journey as a home baker.First things first, we have to look into the prime appliance that we are working with. Commercial ovens are of two types: one that runs on gas and the other that runs on electricity. We have to look at the oven present at our home and consider its pros and cons. The main benefits of a gas oven are its size and temperature control. One can quickly change the temperature just by twisting the knob, and it preheats much more quickly than an electric one. However, they are known to have uneven temperatures at times and release more humidity, making it harder to properly crisp or brown food. This can result in burnt edges and cold or hot spots. An electric oven, on the other hand, provides more even and consistent temperatures and doesn’t release as much moisture in the air.This dry oven environment makes it easier to brown your items, making it great for baking bread. However, while the dry oven results in more even cooking, you also run the risk of drying out cakes and other baked goods.Also, many people forget to preheat the oven before baking, which is crucial for maintaining an even temperature throughout the baking process. When baking cakes and bread, I like to place a small tray of water at the bottom of the oven to provide moisture and prevent the baked goods from drying out.An oven thermometer can be a baker's best friend, providing a true reading and ensuring your creations bake evenly. I also like rotating the pan midway while baking, as it allows for an even distribution of heat.The next thing people mess up on is measuring and the specificity of ingredients in a recipe. Our moms made our food with their instinct; it is something that they learned along the way, but when you are baking, you cannot instinctively add or omit a few steps.I think that is why we initially had problems with baking. In a culture where cooking comes instinctually, baking challenges us, to be precise. A gram of more or less of any ingredient can drastically alter the outcome. Different methods of measuring flour can yield different results.Every component in baking serves a distinct purpose and function. Flour offers structure, sugar adds sweetness and moisture, eggs bind things together, and butter enhances taste and texture. However, not all ingredients are created equally. For example, using salted butter instead of unsalted might change the taste profile of your meal.Similarly, different flours have varying protein concentrations, which affect the texture of baked goods. The type of sugar used also makes a difference. Granulated sugar, brown sugar, powdered sugar, and speciality sugars like turbinado or muscovado each add unique flavours to a bake.Understanding these nuances and how they interact is critical for getting the intended outcomes. Accurate measurement tools and techniques are essential, but mastering them can be a steep learning curve. So, I would recommend investing in a kitchen scale that allows for more accurate measurements by weight rather than volume.Moving on, leavening agents such as baking soda, baking powder, and yeast are required to make baked goods rise. However, they can also cause confusion and errors. Baking soda needs an acidic component to activate, but baking powder has both an acid and a base, making it self-activating.Using the wrong type of flour or sugar, or using them in incorrect proportions, can result in flat, overly raised, or collapsed cakes. Yeast, being a living organism, presents its challenges.The water temperature must be just right—not too hot to kill the yeast, nor too cold to inhibit its activity. Proofing times and conditions also need to be carefully managed to achieve the perfect rise.Bakers should also be careful about the way they mix ingredients. The method of mixing ingredients can significantly impact the final product. Over-mixing can develop too much gluten in cakes and pastries, leading to tough textures.Under-mixing can leave pockets of unincorporated ingredients, resulting in uneven bakes. Techniques like folding, creaming, and whipping each serve specific purposes and must be executed with care.Finally, home bakers must understand the importance of timing and patience in baking. Even a minute or two can make the difference between perfectly baked cookies and burnt edges.Recipes often provide a range for baking times, but factors like oven hot spots, pan material, and altitude can affect these times. It’s crucial to keep a close eye on your bakes and rely on visual and tactile cues, such as a cake pulling away from the sides of the pan or a toothpick coming out clean, to determine doneness.Baking is also an exercise in patience, a virtue not everyone possesses. Doughs need time to rest and rise, flavours need time to meld, and baked goods need time to cool before they can be enjoyed.Impatience can lead to underbaked centres, crumbling slices, and a general sense of frustration. Cultivating patience is as important as mastering any technique in the baker’s repertoire.Home baking is a journey full of ups and downs, but it comes with great rewards. The obstacles encountered teach valuable lessons in patience, precision, and perseverance.The satisfaction of success, the freedom to create, and the therapeutic benefits make the endeavour meaningful. Whether baking for oneself, loved ones, or as an artistic outlet, the journey is as fulfilling as the result. Embrace the flour-dusted countertops, occasional setbacks, and the joys of home bakingFor a beginner-friendly recipe that involves mixing ingredients and delivers amazing results, try my recipe for fudgy, nutty brownies that I call ‘Bliss Brownies’.Bliss Brownies150g unsalted butter plus extra for the tin150g chopped dark chocolate200g caster sugar½ tsp baking powder2 eggs80g cocoa powder150g plain flour70g mixture of nuts (walnuts and almonds)60g blended papayaMix all the ingredients (except the dark chocolate and nuts) in a blender or a food processor and blitz till you get a smooth paste.Fold the chocolate and the nuts into the brownie batter, making sure that the pieces are evenly mixed in.Grease a loaf pan with soft butter and dust with cocoa powder. Pour the batter into the loaf pan.Bake in a preheated oven at 170c for 40 minutes and let it cool in the oven for an hour. Enjoy with a cup of coffee or, as I like it, a scoop of vanilla ice cream. \nIn a world where acceptance and safety often seem difficult to attain, many queer individuals also struggle to find a safe space to express themselves. They have to hide their true self and face relentless judgement when going to public places like cafes and restaurants.This is the reality for countless LGBTQIA+ individuals. The need for a safe space for this community is not just a desire but a necessity—a space where one can be themselves. This struggle for safety and acceptance can be traced to crucial historical moments, such as the Stonewall Riots of 1969 in New York City.The Stonewall Inn was more than a bar; it was a refuge for the queer community. When police raided the bar, the community fought back. This series of violent confrontations, which began in the early hours of June 28, 1969, between police and gay rights activists, marked the beginning of the modern LGBTQIA+ rights movement. The spirit of Stonewall, the fight for dignity and the right to exist openly lives on in places like Inclusive Galaxy Restaurant in Kathmandu. Inclusive Galaxy beyond a restaurant is an ‘oasis’ for the queer community and beyond.Founded by Bishwaraj Adhikari, Mr Gay Handsome Nepal 2013, a human rights defender, the restaurant proves the power of safe spaces. It’s a place where the community can unite, free from the prejudice and hostility that often permeate their everyday lives.After years of working in the human rights sector, Adhikari and his partner developed the idea for Inclusive Galaxy. What began as a small cafe gradually evolved into a full-fledged restaurant, driven by the growing demand and support from the community.“In developed countries with strong LGBTQIA+ movements, you can find community areas like gay villages. These are created as safe spaces for people whose families and communities have excluded them. They also support new business ideas and pink tourism. I hope to see pink tourism develop in Nepal someday,” says Adhikari. His vision for Inclusive Galaxy goes beyond just being a restaurant. He aims to promote financial independence and empowerment within the queer community.Since its inception in February 2019, Inclusive Galaxy has become a key spot for many in Lazimpat, a relatively queer-friendly area in Kathmandu. The location is essential because the first LGBTQIA+ movement in Nepal started in 2001 through the Blue Diamond Society.Inclusive Galaxy, true to its name, welcomes everyone—queer and non-queer alike—to share a comfortable space. His vision was clear: to create a space where people of all genders and sexual identities could come together without fear of exclusion.“I didn’t want to make it exclusively for queer people because that would be excluding ourselves from society. Different groups need to live together and understand each other,” Adhikari explains.In the early days, the cafe attracted both queer and non-queer customers. However, when some of the residents learned about Adhikari’s identity and the nature of the clientele, there was a brief period of hesitation. “At first, I didn’t understand what was happening, but then I realised my identity was an issue for a few people. I believe people should be judged by others by their character, not by their gender or sexuality. Over time, as residents saw that we operated like any other cafe, they became more comfortable,” Adhikari reflects.Adhikari started Inclusive Galaxy to give queer individuals a place to be proud of themselves, counteracting the self-doubt and insecurity that hiding one’s identity can cause. This turned the cafe very quickly into a community hub. The journey was not without challenges, though. It was difficult to hire staff and cooks from the LGBTQIA+ community, and soon after the restaurant opened, the COVID pandemic made things even harder.Despite these difficulties, the doors of Inclusive Galaxy remained open. During the pandemic, many queer individuals, who were abandoned by their families or afraid to return home, found comfort at Inclusive Galaxy.Since many couldn’t afford to pay for meals, the restaurant provided free food from its resources. As the number of people needing meals grew to 20-30 daily, Adhikari started raising funds within the community.“During my time as an activist, many people came here not only for food but also to see an organisation where the queer community supports one another,” Adhikari says.“The time during COVID was difficult, but it brought me closer to the community.”Four years after its inception, the restaurant has garnered a loyal following. Sarosy Neupane, Miss Pink Nepal 2024 first runner-up, describes Inclusive Galaxy as her second home. She moved to Kathmandu to study in 2022. Being distant from her family, she started visiting Galaxy for meals that reminded her of home-cooked food. Over time, she grew attached to the café because of its welcoming atmosphere.“It’s heartwarming to see people from our community and different walks of life here. The founders even invite us to festivals like ‘Dahi Chiura Khane din,’” she shares.Neupane visits the cafe regularly and sometimes stays until 3 am, engrossed in conversations. “I hope more spaces like this can open in the future. If, unfortunately, this place were to close someday, I don’t think we’d have any other place to turn to,” she adds.Muna Chhetri, a trans woman who has been a loyal customer for three years, shares, “This is my safe space where I can truly be myself. I always feel judged in other restaurants, but that fear doesn’t exist here. It’s where even those who aren’t accepted at home can feel accepted.”Sahara Khadka Chhetri, owner of Pink Tiffany, Kathmandu’s first openly LGBTIQIA+ friendly restaurant and bar, frequently visits after managing the bar, appreciating the convenience of not cooking at home.She notes very few places like this cater to our community, and some even had to close during COVID. “As an entrepreneur, I know that sustaining these spaces is a challenge. But as more spaces like these open, they will make the way for a more inclusive and compassionate society.”The welcoming atmosphere at Inclusive Galaxy has also had a surprising effect on non-queer patrons. Samriddha Jung Rana, a twenty-year-old neighbour who identifies as straight, often visits the café and appreciates the importance of such spaces.“Previously, I didn’t know much about the queer community and didn’t care much. But now, coming into this café, I’ve been interested in their rights and issues. I’ve realised that we’re not so different after all. We are all human,” he remarks.The ventures like Inclusive Galaxy and Pink Tiffany have inspired hope for collaborative businesses between queer and non-queer groups. The recent initiative by the Nepal Tourism Board promoting Pink Tourism in April 2024 is a positive step. Still, Adhikari believes that more support is needed from the government and the private sector.Despite the progress, challenges remain. However, Adhikari remains optimistic about the future. He is working on plans to develop the restaurant into a homestay program in the future.“Like how different planets, asteroids, and stars make up a beautiful galaxy, people from all walks of life and identities make a beautiful society. I am happy that we are assimilating together in this space. We are not so different; we are all different and similar simultaneously,” he says. \nAditya Mishra is a Nepali chef and entrepreneur based in New York. Passionate about elevating Nepali cuisine globally, Mishra sharpened his culinary skills while staging at various Michelin-starred restaurants in the city during his time at culinary school. A recipient of the James Beard Foundation National Scholars Scholarship in 2023, Mishra’s early experiences inspired him to establish his own supper club, ‘The Sewing Tin’, alongside co-founder Akhil Upad.In an interview with Post’s Aarati Ray, Mishra discusses his restaurant in New York, serving Nepali cuisines there and the recipe for his signature dish.How did your cooking journey start in New York?At 14, I told my parents I wanted to be a chef, but they preferred I pursue a stable career like engineering, as many Nepali families do. So, I left for Louisiana in 2019 to study engineering.But, cooking never left my heart so, after a year, I left engineering college and moved to New York City. It’s been three and a half years and my parents only learned about it later. When my mom visited me in NYC and saw my dedication to cooking, she saw my passion and supported my decision.What sparked your interest in cooking from a young age?As a child, I was drawn to cooking shows on TLC. The glamour of cooking, eating, travelling and the prosperity of famous chefs was fascinating.Around age 16, I discovered Chef Anthony Bourdain’s groundbreaking book, ‘Kitchen Confidential’, which shed light on the reality of the culinary industry. I learned how he became a cultural icon in NYC, reshaping perceptions of chefs.I was also fascinated by chefs like Marco Pierre White, who was a mentor to Gordon Ramsay. Their stories of achieving fame while maintaining discipline intrigued me. But, as I grew older and entered the culinary world, I realised it was far from glamorous—it involved dedication and I am glad I persevered.How did the idea for The Sewing Tin originate?The concept of ‘The Sewing Tin’ came when I realised the stark contrast between the romanticised view of kitchen work and its harsh reality. Witnessing the struggles of many kitchen staff—economic hardships, immigration challenges and language barriers—I had to rediscover my love for cooking.During my internship at ‘Junoon’ restaurant, I met my co-founder, Akhil Upad, who shared my culinary enthusiasm despite his preparations for medical college. Together, we wanted to create a dining experience that was more personal and communal, offering fine dining with a sense of community.We wanted our food to tell stories, so we named our restaurant ‘The Sewing Tin’ inspired by the immigrant experience in NYC. When immigrants opened cookie boxes as kids, they often found sewing supplies instead of food.‘The Sewing Tin’ is like opening a cookie box and finding sewing supplies—something uniquely desi, or South Asian. How do you promote Nepali cuisine in New York City through The Sewing Tin?My partner is from Atlanta with Indian roots, while I come from Nepal, so our menu celebrates and reflects both cultures and heritage.We represent our respective cultures authentically. For example, we have a dish inspired by Newari cuisine called kachaila, similar to French Tartar. We present it as Tartar to make it accessible to our customers but infuse it with Nepali flavours, telling stories about its origins and giving diners a taste of my homeland.What do you think of the prospects of Nepali cuisine abroad?I’m on a mission to share Nepali food worldwide. I have served up dishes like chatamari and lamb sekuwa in my restaurant. But I’m still learning and want to explore more of Nepal’s cuisines. My big dream? To make Nepali cuisine reach more places because it’s got something special that can wow taste buds everywhere.How do you see the changes in restaurants in Nepal?The restaurant industry has deep roots in community and bringing people together, dating back centuries. While this core idea remains, modern restaurants have evolved, making changes to adapt to the times.Yet, in Nepal, despite the growing number of restaurants, many lack uniqueness and storytelling, focusing more on making money than fostering a sense of community.I’ve noticed a troubling trend of rising prices, especially for beloved dishes like momos, which makes people question if they're getting value for their money. It seems like profits are taking precedence over creating genuine, authentic culinary experiences.The industry is starting to lose the creativity and passion that once made it special. It might be time for chefs to shake things up, challenge the norm and bring fresh ideas to the table, revitalising the culinary scene with renewed energy and creativity.What challenges have you faced in New York as an outsider?Living in a bustling city like New York as an outsider has its challenges. But, this city is also full of opportunities for those who are passionate. If you stay true to your culture and want to share your story, opportunities are waiting for you.Even though it can be daunting because of the tough competition, the city appreciates determination and expertise. When I started my journey here, all I wanted to do was cook, eat and share the story of Nepal and its diverse cultures. Instead of focusing on the difficulties, I embraced the chance to follow my passion.What do you think about the criticism of blending Nepali food with modern culinary styles?Chefs care about their food—it’s like they’re sharing a story. They’ve put in a lot of effort to become skilled, so let them be creative. It’s okay to give helpful advice but don’t be mean just to criticise. Chefs shouldn’t also just copy what’s popular, they should cook what they truly love. That’s what makes food special and meaningful.Mishra’s signature dish:Confit Duck Chatamari A traditional Nepali delicacy with French influence.Ingredients:Duck (Legs and breast)Rice (soaked overnight)MayonnaiseWhole spices (cloves, cinnamon, cardamom, bay leaf)Red onionGarlicGingerMula ko achar (Fermented radish)ScallionsLemon juiceNepali pepperVinegarSaltSugarProcedure:For the Duck:Season duck with salt and pepper.Cook in a covered pan with whole spices, garlic, and ginger at low heat for 2 hours on a stove (270 degrees in the oven)Increase heat to crisp up the skin (approximately 15 minutes).Shred the duck meat.Confit Garlic Aioli:Mash cooked garlic and ginger and mix with mayonnaise, lemon juice, Nepali pepper and fermented radishes.Pickled Onions:Slice onions and cook in a mixture of vinegar, water, salt, sugar, and whole spices until softened (about 10 minutes).For the chatamari:Blend soaked rice to make a batter, let it ferment for 6 hours, and adjust consistency with water.Assembling:Cook chatamari batter in duck fat for 4 minutes.Top with shredded duck, aioli, pickled onions and scallions.Serve \nCeleus Baral exudes a serene aura when you meet her, and when she tells you she bakes, it makes sense. Even during a brief encounter, you can tell she has the patience needed to be a baker.“You can eyeball cooking, but baking is chemistry. You have to be meticulous. You cannot rush it, or it does not turn out as expected,” says the 21-year-old environment science student. She also runs the online baking shop Bakeleus. Recently, she has also started selling her baked goods beyond her online shop, with her first stall appearing at The Yellow House’s Night Market. Bakeleus’s menu lists a variety of offerings, including jams, granola, tarts, cakes, cookies, cupcakes and brownies. Baral began baking in 2020, during the lockdown, and launched her online shop last year.She grows much of the produce she incorporates into her baking, and believes we should all understand the origins of our food. “This connection fosters gratitude and a deeper appreciation for nature,” she says. Her background in environmental science, coupled with her affinity for the natural world, imbues her creations with a unique artistic sensibility. Each item she bakes is a testament to her creativity and experimentation, as she believes consistent practice is the key to mastery.Despite the demands of being a full-time student, Baral strives to accommodate orders, typically requiring a minimum of 72 hours' notice for delivery. She is a passionate and discerning individual, evident in the love she infuses into her baking. Additionally, Baral advocates for a zero-waste policy at home, ensuring that every scrap of food and all household items are recycled.Three easy to bake recipes you can try at homeMini carrot cakes Ingredients:38 g milk or yoghurt35 g all-purpose flour1/4 tea spoon ground cinnamon1/8 tea spoon ground gingerA pinch of cardamom1 tea spoon baking powder½ tea spoon fine sea salt2 large eggs, at room temperature27 g granulated sugar13 g brown sugar (or 39 g of regular granulated sugar)1 tea spoon vanilla extract27 g extra virgin olive oil33 g carrots, peeled and shreddedChopped walnutsCandied lemon or orange slices (optional for garnish)Cream cheese frosting56.5 g unsalted butter, softened113.5 g cream cheese, softened1/2 teaspoon vanilla extractA pinch of salt250 g powdered sugarDirections:For the cake:Preheat the oven to 195°C.

The vegetable is relatively cheap and used in almost all cuisines and curries. This ubiquity could perhaps be why someone might be snubbingly called an ‘aloo’ in Nepal, but the reference does not make potatoes less important.Why have them With zero fat, potatoes contain many important nutrients—vitamins B1, B6, Vitamin C, which is an antioxidant, minerals and fibre. Along with starch, it is a good source of potassium, copper, vitamin C, manganese, phosphorus, niacin, dietary fibre and pantothenic acid. Potassium derived from potatoes is an electrolyte that benefits the heart, muscles and nervous system. Potato skin contains fibre, which is important for digestive health.Compared to other vegetables, potatoes are more energy-dense. It is free of fat, gluten, cholesterol and sodium. The relatively cheap plant-based food is also a good source of carbohydrates. Filled with nutrients, one can get a lot of them by consuming potatoes.Sourcing of potatoesPotatoes thrive in diverse climatic conditions. The country cultivates potatoes on around 200,000 hectares of land—from the plains of Tarai to the mountainous region.Every year, Nepal churns out around 3,410,000 tons of the stuff. It also imports potatoes and potato products worth Rs 8.71 billion.“These imports include potato chips, frozen potatoes and fresh potatoes,” said Biswas Poudel, a senior technical officer at the National Potato Research Programme.As its cultivation is possible in diverse landscapes, even climate change does not affect potato farming, experts say. Types of potatoesRed and white potatoes are popular and widely available in the country. Lately, dark potatoes or blue potatoes are gaining popularity.“Red potatoes are highly popular,” said Poudel. “Potatoes that come in colour contain more nutrients. Darker potatoes are packed with antioxidants.”Potatoes that taste sweet are a good source of vitamin A, an important nutrient for immunity and eye health. Purple potatoes are rich in antioxidants, including anthocyanins that may prevent heart disease and cancer and boost brain health.Other benefits As potatoes contain important nutrients, they benefit human health in multiple ways. Iron, phosphorus, calcium, magnesium, and zinc contained in potatoes help the body build and maintain its structure and strength. Consumption of the vegetable that is rich in potassium, calcium and magnesium helps reduce blood pressure naturally. Potatoes also contain a significant amount of fibre, which helps in lowering cholesterol levels in the blood and ultimately lessens the risk of heart disease. Fibre also boosts digestive health.Compared to other green vegetables, farmers use only a minimal amount of pesticides in potatoes, making them safe to eat. Chips and french friesOf late potato chips and french fries are gaining popularity in Nepal. They are also popular dishes in most restaurants and people have even started making french fries at home. Children love potato chips the most. Intake of nutrients and micronutrients, fibre and antioxidants components depends on how potatoes were cooked or prepared for food.Consumption of a lot of chips and french fries can lead to added calories and unhealthy weight gain.“Fibre and antioxidant and other micronutrients of the potatoes may be lost while frying,” said Poudel. “As potatoes are a carbohydrate-rich vegetable, it is not necessary to consume them with rice, which many people do in Nepal.”Experts say diabetic people should limit their potato intake as they cause spikes in blood sugar. \nThe noise of ever-growing traffic, the breaking and mending of black-topped roads, and an ever-expanding concrete jungle are some features that one would associate with the Kathmandu Valley.It is a wildly growing urban forest quickly transforming into a busy metropolis where every inch of space is ready to be sold and built. Yet, pockets of the past remain—small, peaceful neighbourhoods where houses are still made of wood, paths are made of stone tiles, and the stillness of a world that wants to stay intact and immobile. These places are known for tourism, culture, and the restoration of community pride. One such stop is the quiet village of Khokana in southern Lalitpur.Khokana is comparatively close to the mainland urban Lalitpur; from the ring road junction of Bagdole, it takes only a 10-minute drive to reach there. From the airport, you can take a cab directly to Khokana, which will take around half an hour. Get your cameras and hiking boots ready; the area is filled with historical artefacts and hiking trails.However, it is vastly different from the city. It is much nearer to the hills, where stone-paved paths, which could easily be goat trails, are rare in today’s Kathmandu.One such goat trail leads to Sikali temple, a major attraction of the area and accessible only on foot. The pavements are lined with big and small temples on each side, along with ponds that serve as clean water sources and a location for religious rituals. The houses are made of bricks and wood. The concrete invasion, although present, is minimal. Scattered every few hundred metres are small mustard oil mills, co-operative businesses of the locals of Khokana that have existed since medieval times.A site well-recognised for its historical significance, Khokana was even proposed to be made a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1996. Sikali TempleAround an hour’s walk from the historic town, Sikali Temple can be reached, which is also the location for its famed Sikali Jatra.While it can be reached through any public vehicle, a more holistic and adventurous route is to follow the goat trails on the outskirts of Khokana. This route, albeit long, allows for great hiking opportunities, scenic views of the hills surrounding the Kathmandu Valley, and a close-up view of the mediaeval but well-maintained architecture of the local houses.Even if you lose the way, which is very possible, the locals are very welcoming and more than willing to guide you. The main temple itself is three stories tall, and built in the Pagoda style, a common style in many temples in the valley.It is surrounded by a lush grass field which plays the stage to the Sikali Jatra held every year. The temple, like many religious spots around Khokana, is dedicated to the local deity Shree Rudrayani.The Sikali Jatra, a five-day festival that serves as an alternative to Dashain for the Khokana locals, is filled with chariot dances, battle enactments, and storytelling celebrations in the worship of Goddess Rudrayani.Starting from Ghatasthapana in mid to late September, the Jatra is vibrant and an essential experience for every visitor. Historical Khokana townKhokana’s historical town is located around 5 minutes walking distance from the local bus park. The town complex, paved with hand-made stone tiles, is graced with the Indrayanee temple but also has many red-bricked houses built in the local Newari architecture, some of them centuries old.One such house is the ‘Khokana Museum’. Although closed, it is widely popular for being the first house to be lit with electricity in Nepal, as Chandra Shamsher did in 1911.The stand-holder of the first light bulb can still be seen, serving as a historical monument for everyone to see.Similarly, the town complex is also filled with Guthi houses, small ponds, and even the local Ward office. While the Ward office provides a wealth of information for visitors interested in the area’s history, the Guthi halls symbolise the strong community support culture of the locals.The ponds, a notable one present right opposite the Indrayanee temple, have stone taps and remind us of primitive ways of obtaining clean water—a practice many locals are still engaged in.Yet, these ponds are also religious locations, especially used in rituals in the Sikali Jatra.Finally, a stroll through the complex allows visitors to explore old houses and historical artefacts in the serene quietness of Khokana, while the small outlets and Choila places nearby allow you to enjoy the spicy duck or chicken delicacies at the same time.Overall, the historical complex is enough to transport visitors back to a glimpse of the medieval past of the Kathmandu Valley. Mustard oil millsThe most well-known feature of Khokana is its mustard oil mills, which have been operational for hundreds of years and have been using the same methods of preparation since their inception.These mills, scattered throughout Khokana, are often community-owned, and even the ones owned by certain individuals have almost exclusively employed locals.Despite the advent of modern machinery, there is still substantial demand for their products due to the assured guarantee.When I visited one such mill, the local staff informed me that the furnace and oil presser used by them were 300 years old, given by the Patan royalty even before the Shahs became king.In addition to buying pure, organically created mustard oil and pellets, visiting these oil mills offers many educational benefits for international and local tourists alike.Khokana offers visitors a unique glimpse into a preserved bubble of the past through its tranquillity, preservation of ancient lifestyle and cultural elements, and remarkable self-sustenance.  \n“How much oxygen do you have for the summit?”I think this is the kind of question a film producer would ask. But when you're on the mountain, the answer is never clear.I have worked for a long time in the film industry and different art areas, especially photography and engraving.Working in various fields and drawing inspiration from them has become a new normal for me. I have made this approach my way of life without even realising it.I took responsibility for producing the last movie I worked on and shot the behind-the-scenes footage for a documentary. By doing so, I witnessed the entire shooting process and the journey of a movie.In the snowy highlands of Turkey, we had to endure the consequences of the changing climate to shoot ‘About Dry Grasses’, directed by Nuri Bilge Ceylan. The highlands used to be snowy in January, but by the time we got there in the same month, there was no snow. Nature was changing. It was responding to what was happening—to what humanity had done to it. In the end, it snowed, and we shot the intense snow scenes we wanted. But since most of our days were sunny, unlike what the director wanted, we had to shoot in the sunset and sunrise hours. As crew members, we spent many days waiting for the sun to set.Production requires creating opportunities, finding solutions, and being creative for a work of art to come true. For this, patience, endurance, calmness, and timing are necessary. On the other hand, nature wanted us to listen to it and wait for the right time.During that time, I witnessed many of nature's lessons. For example, I experienced extreme cold for the first time. We endured temperatures ranging from -33 degrees to +55 degrees. By listening to nature, surrendering to its forces, and working within its limits, we managed to persevere.No matter how much you prepare or plan during the pre-production phase, if you are working in nature, remember that nature will always have the final say.The film was completed, released, and connected with audiences. Its success at Cannes 2023 was followed by my trip to the North Pole for my project. I returned with a mix of wonderful developments, joys, and challenges. During this process, I experienced life and death, happiness and sadness, losses and awards.I realised the value of being able to breathe comfortably a few days after my father's chemotherapy ended. Just a few days earlier, he had said, \"Well done, my daughter. I'm glad you went!\" All the anxiety and hard work, filled with fears at the beginning, were finally behind me.Before going to Everest, when I was on the verge of giving up, defeated by my fears, I remembered my father's words. Everest reminded me of what he said while struggling to breathe, adding a turning point to my life.What does it mean to say ‘life’s turning point?’ How many turning points can there be in life?Who am I, and what am I doing in this world? How well do I know my own limits? Can I find answers to these big questions? These thoughts sparked my dream of journeying to Everest. Now, after returning, I can say that it turned my life around.“How much oxygen do you need for the summit?” sounds more like “How much do you need to hold on to life?” How many reasons do you find that give meaning to your life, keep you alive, and allow you to breathe? How much can you endure in the face of obstacles, and can you keep believing that a solution will eventually come your way?Can these questions be separated from the idea of measuring and assessing something, from learning its quantity and financial value? Can everything be known with certainty? Should the journey be fully understood in advance, with all its promises laid out? Should it be viewed like a purchase with a price tag, asking, “Is this journey worth this much?”I had never trekked before and had no climbing experience. I had lived at sea level my entire life and had never been to a high altitude.However, this journey was not only about the physical climb but also an inner discovery. After losing my father to lung cancer, his breathing difficulties taught me the fragility of breath, life, and existence. I also mentally prepared myself for the physical challenges I might face. Despite all my concerns, could this journey help me understand the cycle of life and the resilience of the soul?So, how could I make this trek possible? How could I land in Nepal? Despite all the economic difficulties and the many things I felt needed organising, I did my best and believed in it.Since I was embarking on this journey, I felt I should share about my travels and inspire others.Starting with photography, cinema, and engraving, which are already integral parts of my life, I dreamed of documenting and sharing the inspiring aspects of this journey.After months of correspondence and dreaming, it all came true. Finally, I embarked on the journey with the goal of creating photographs, engravings, and documentaries. I learned a great deal from my travels in Nepal, from the people I met, and from every moments I witnessed. I felt incredibly fortunate to have been able to honour my father’s memory with the peace and serenity I experienced in the Himalayas.During my 15-day journey to Everest Base Camp, I encountered nature’s masterpieces at every turn. As concerns like “How will I endure?” and “How will I finish?” started to weigh on me, the mountains suddenly parted with the clouds and gazed down at me.It was amazing to witness the appearance of ‘Gods’ that I had never seen before, in such immense size and in such a close, awe-inspiring manner beside me during that silent walk.As someone who came from one of the most crowded cities in the world, Istanbul, while I struggled with my daily questions and uncertainties, trying to control everything, they stood there calmly, as if answering me.They were just there—before and after.My guide, Lakhpa Sherpa, always reminded me not to worry about how high we were, how long it would take to reach our accommodation, or what the weather would be like. He encouraged me to live in the moment, and he was right.He advised me to focus on my breathing, not to get thirsty, to eat enough, and to appreciate the extraordinary beauty of the journey. In the mountains, plans dissolve and each moment is embraced as it comes.All the good wishes, prayers, and everything encountered along the way were for the journey itself. The mountain was full of life, secrets, and everything I had wondered about.This 15-day journey to Everest Base Camp was a solo adventure, yet I wouldn't have been able to complete it without my guide, Lhakpa, and my porter. Additionally, I was fortunate enough to experience the hospitality, generosity, and honesty at Trekkers Paradise, which organised the entire journey and provided guidance.I witnessed how dedication and sincerity are crucial in completing a journey safely and healthily. Ghanshyam Sharma, from Trekkers Paradise and Sauraj Jhingan, a climber who summited the Everest in 2018, shared their experiences with me during the journey.They experienced the 2015 earthquake while they were at the Everest Base Camp.As a filmmaker, their role as actors, and attention to detail played a significant role in bringing my dream photography and documentary project to life.The sponsors of my journey were Turkish Airlines, The North Face, Apple, Canon, and Stanley. My supporters include Oscar International College and Nepal Film Campus. Throughout the journey, I shared many experiences, memories, and countless photos and images with my students.On my way back home after 21 days, I celebrated my birthday on the plane. From the right window, the Himalayas bid me farewell. I felt like I had opened a new chapter in my life, and I was certain that I would return.I had made many friends and memories in Nepal.For now, I will be working on a documentary and preparing for a photography and engraving exhibition titled ‘My Soul Beyond the Mountain’.To the Himalayas: This summer was spent with you, but we will meet again soon. \nJournalists embarked on a five-day tour of Sri Lanka, covering over 1,000 kilometers, exploring religious sites, tea estates, a national park, and the economic recovery of the country's tourism industry.\nMundhum Trek in Koshi province in the eastern part of Nepal is a new cultural walking trail. It passes through several indigenous ethnic villages and landscapes in Khotang and Bhojpur districts. This trail goes up to an elevation of 4,200 metres to the viewpoint of Silchung Peak and takes one through the settlements of the Kirati people. This route starts from Diktel Bazaar and passes through beautiful settlements like Chakhewa, Rawa Dhap, Salpa Bhanjyang, Silchung and Hanspokhari before ending in Bhojpur. There are some hotels in Diktel but trekkers are advised to carry tents. The trail offers panoramic views of most of the eight-thousanders, including Everest, Lhotse, Makalu, Cho Oyu and Kanchenjunga mountains. The spring season, March through May, is highly recommended for the trek.Janaki Mandir Janaki Mandir at Janakpur in Madhesh province was constructed in 1874 and is a blend of Mughal and local architecture. The temple is a three-storey building and has 60 rooms, making it the largest temple in Nepal. Pilgrims flock here by the thousands to pay homage to Janaki Mandir—Janaki being the other name of Sita, the daughter of King Janak. The temple houses an idol of Sita which was found near Ayodhya, the kingdom of Ram. The marriage anniversary of Lord Ram and Sita is celebrated in Janakpur every year on Vivaha Panchami, which falls in December. In the southwest corner of Janaki Mandir is the Vivaha Mandap, which has been built at the site where the marriage of Ram and Sita is said to have taken place. Another well-known temple in the vicinity is Ram Mandir, which is built in pagoda style and is hence different from the other temples in Janakpur that generally bear resemblance to Mughal architecture. It houses a female statue, said to be of Yogamaya, which has the reputation of being one of the most beautiful images of female forms in Nepal. Other holy sites of interest include the Laxman Temple, Sankat Mochan Temple and Hanuman Temple.Kuri Village, Kalinchok Kuri village, a popular tourist destination around 150 km from Kathmandu, lies at an altitude of 3,842 metres above sea level in Kalinchowk of Dolakha district, in Bagmati province. People visit the place to enjoy the snow during the winter besides the mesmerising landscapes and splendid panoramic view of the Himalayan range. Kalinchok gets snow mainly at the end of December and the snowfall continues till the end of February or mid-March. When there is snow, it is difficult for jeeps, buses and cars to reach the top of Kuri village. Chains are wrapped around the wheels of vehicles and specially modified jeeps with highly experienced drivers are used to carry visitors. There are several hotels and restaurants in the area. The road up to Kuri has also improved over the years.Annapurna Base Camp Annapurna Base Camp trek, in Gandaki province, makes for a picturesque journey that takes you to the foothills of the Annapurna South, up to 4,130 metres above sea level. The five-day trek (seven days for slow walkers) offers rich cultural diversities, typical Nepali villages and the flora and fauna nestled at the foothills of Annapurna. The distance from Pokhara to Annapurna Base Camp is approximately 81 kilometres. It is among the shortest and most budget-friendly treks in Nepal. For Nepalis, lodging costs around $5 to $10 per day. For foreigners, the overall cost of the trek ranges from $800 to $1500 on average per person. Annapurna Base Camp trek can be done at any time throughout the year as each season offers a different trekking experience. The ideal time for the trek depends on your weather preferences and what you expect from it. However, autumn (September to October) and spring (March to May) are considered the two best seasons for the trek, as the days at the time are warm and bright with clear skies.Bardiya National Park Bardiya National Park, located in the southern Tarai belt of Lumbini province, is home to one of the most elusive and majestic animals on earth—the Royal Bengal Tiger. The park, which covers an area of 968 square kilometres, is considered one of the most important protected areas in the country. It is a prime destination for those looking to catch a glimpse of a tiger. A bit of luck and patience will offer a good chance to see the Bengal Tiger. The jungle safari also offers one the opportunity to spot Asian elephants and the greater one-horned rhinoceros. The rare Gangetic river dolphins are occasionally spotted on rafting trips along the Geruwa River, the eastern channel of the Karnali river. Besides, visitors can enjoy the homestays and explore local Tharu culture. The right time to visit the park is from mid-September to mid-December and mid-February to May.Khaptad National Park Khaptad National Park in Sudurpaschim province is a protected area in the far western region. It stretches over four districts of Bajhang, Bajura, Achham and Doti and ranges in elevation from 1,400 to 3,300 metres. The park can be visited throughout the year. Trekkers are advised to bring their tents, food and other supplies. The Nepal Tourism Board says of late, social media has been increasingly influencing Nepali travellers to go to Khaptad. Since the far-flung Khaptad National Park is still offbeat for many travellers, the area remains pristine and fresh. The seasons of spring (March-May) and autumn (October-November) are the ideal times to visit the park. The temperature ranges from 10°c to 20°c offering pleasant trekking weather. The monsoon begins in June and lasts until September and during this time, roads often become muddy and slippery. From December to February, winter brings snow and chilling winds to the park.Limi Valley \nOnce again, my heart swelled with joy when my hometown came into view.Arriving at Lalikharka after the treacherous journey through Pauwa Bhanjyang and the bustling Kanchhi Dokan, Phidim, the headquarters of Panchthar district, revealed itself like a surprise gift. My home town, Phidim, is unique in the fact that it reveals to travellers approaching it from uphill. As the vehicle descends the mountain road, it slowly comes into view, its houses and buildings recognisable for the native son.This Dashain, I undertook the much-awaited trip to my hometown with my wife Kabita and daughter Aarohi. Little did I anticipate the transformation that awaited me.The moment I got out of the jeep, I noticed that Phidim, nestled in the lush hills, has undergone a remarkable transformation over the years. As I guided my family to my home, which had suffered damages in the 1989 quake that struck eastern Nepal, I found that old, mud and stone houses had been replaced by concrete buildings. The place was vastly different from the one I remembered.Arriving at my childhood home felt like reuniting with an old friend. Navigating its nooks and crannies with my daughter, we delved into the history of the house, a symbol of my cherished memories.My wife had visited Phidim years ago, spending a month with my parents. She, too, recalled beautiful moments she had had in the town. I asked the tenant about the neighbours and acquaintances. Some had died, while others had left for good.A call to local journalist Giriraj Banskota led me to the school grounds, where memories flooded back. This was where I spent my teenage years, playing ball, learning to kick, and watching major tournaments. Here, I even encountered a group of Western climbers headed to Kanchenjunga, the world’s third-highest mountain. I remember being awed by their shiny yellow tents, headlights and strange smell. I remember practising my tutephuteko Angrezi with the climbers. Birendra Shield, an annual sports tournament named after the late king, brought ace players from various schools in Panchthar district. The district also hosted Yuba Mela, an annual three-day fair to commemorate the birthday of the king, organising football tournaments in which teams from as far as Sunsari and Taplejung participated. I never excelled at dribbling balls. A boy growing up in a seven-member family, I soon found my interest in literature. In the late 1980s, Phidim hosted a major literary festival. In the run-up to the 1990 pro-democracy protest, walls were painted with anti-monarchy slogans, local politicians were arrested. I took my family to my school, Naya Namuna Secondary School. It was Saturday, so the school was closed. I peeked through the steel gate and wall, imagining myself labouring over classes. Memories are hazy, but what I remember most is going out of the school—to quiz contests with me leading the school team, to essay competitions at the District Education Office and to play carom board, a national pastime, in a nearby shopfront. Returning to the main street, the demolition of a landmark gate made me reflect on how cities transform, shedding old landmarks for new identities. Navigating narrow alleyways, I felt like a stranger in my own hometown. Multistory buildings have emerged and roads have been paved, reshaping the town. It’s the same place with a different face, leaving me nostalgic for the Phidim of my memories.We finally reached Shivalaya temple, which I told my wife and daughter was one of my cherished hangouts. A giant statue of Falgunanda (the Kirant leader’s birthday is celebrated on November 10) stood before the steps to the temple. Though my wife suspected I came here to smoke, in reality, I visited the temple in the evening to meet friends and talk about issues that mattered most to us at the time. It also offered a panoramic view of the town (I could not take my family to Gadhi Danda, a hillock across the Shivalaya).Towards the end of my journey, I felt sad about Phidim’s lack of prospects. To my dismay, I found that people have been leaving the town in droves. Despite blacktopped roads and multi-story buildings, Phidim faces a troubling reality. The lack of quality higher education and specialist healthcare has driven people away, echoing the circumstances that led me to Kathmandu years ago. Conversations with locals confirmed a mass exodus from the town, a trend that raises concerns about Phidim's future.My conversations with familiar strangers led me to conclude that Phidim has transformed into a transit town for pilgrims heading to Pathibhara Devi Temple, which is around 255 kilometres north in Taplejung district. I met dozens of people headed to the holy site. While pilgrims see it as a stopover, for me, it was a homecoming. The realisation dawned that Phidim is, perhaps, in a state of transition, trading its rustic charm for the hallmarks of urbanisation. While I left Phidim for higher education in Kathmandu, people from rural areas have flocked to the town in search of better opportunities, bringing life and energy to the once quiet community.As we bid adieu to my hometown, I couldn’t help but reflect on the inevitability of leaving a place, no matter how enamoured one is with it. Passing Kanchhi Dokan, I pointed out Kanchnajungha and Kumbhakarna to my daughter—symbols of my childhood. Phidim, now a blend of nostalgia and change, remains etched in my heart, a testament to the intricate dance between memory and evolution. \nEngland finally showed their true colours at the European Championship on Wednesday, putting on a convincing and effective performance when it mattered most to book themselves a berth in Sunday’s final in Berlin.Ollie Watkins’ late winner to secure the 2-1 win over the Netherlands was as much as they deserved after dominating the encounter in a display their supporters had been eagerly awaiting but barely daring to hope for.It was an emphatic answer after the criticism heaped on the side for some languid showings against underwhelming opposition earlier in the tournament, and sets up a mouth-watering final against a slick-looking Spain.England had frustrated their followers, looking pedestrian at times in the group phase as well as their knockout round games. It was as if they were suffocating at times under a heavy burden of expectation, a feeling coach Gareth Southgate said on Tuesday that they learned to leave behind as they went deeper into the tournament.Their round of 16 performance as they edged Slovakia bordered on the miraculous, snatching victory minutes from being eliminated, and there was a nervy showing as they fought back, again, to edge Switzerland on penalties in the quarter-final.This time, however, there was a positivity about their play from the start, even if it was a third successive game where they went behind, this time to Xavi Simons’ spectacular seventh minute effort.Harry Kane’s penalty equaliser was followed by a sustained period of pressure on the Dutch defence, with England shaking off the cobwebs and properly greasing the wheels of their attack.The individual quality of their players was on full display and they had their opponents pegged back, looking dangerous every time they entered the final third. Phil Foden was exceedingly unlucky not to have them ahead at halftime with some sublime skill but had his effort cleared off the line.The second period was not as dominant as fatigue set in and the Dutch enjoyed their fair share of possession.But even then, whenever England moved menacingly forward, a goal looked on the cards.It was almost to script that they engineered victory just before the final whistle, as Watkins emerged an unlikely hero not long after coming on.The confidence boost cannot be underestimated, especially as an in-form opponent awaits on Sunday at the Olympiastadion.When they needed to stand up and be counted, the real England came to the party and, after almost a month of gritty competition, the tournament has two worthy finalists. \nColombia beat Uruguay 1-0 in their Copa America semi-final on Thursday despite being reduced to 10 men for 45 minutes to book a title decider against defending champions Argentina thanks to a first-half header from Jefferson Lerma.Uruguay’s Darwin Nunez missed several chances in the first half and Colombia made them pay when Lerma rose above the defence on a corner in the 39th minute and squeezed his header past goalkeeper Sergio Rochet.Colombia went down to 10 men just before halftime when Daniel Munoz lost his cool and got himself sent off, with the right back receiving a second yellow card for elbowing Manuel Ugarte in the chest when play was stopped.Uruguay dominated possession in the second half and veteran striker Luis Suarez nearly equalised when he hit the post but Colombia bravely held on for a famous win and will play Argentina in Sunday’s final.Uruguay will play Canada a day earlier in the third-place playoff. \nNepal national women’s cricket team suffered back-to-back defeat in their ACC Women’s T20 Asia Cup preparatory tour as they lost to Sri Lanka Development Squad by four wickets in their second practice match at Surrey Village Cricket Stadium in Maggona on Wednesday.Chasing 107 set by Nepal, Sri Lanka Development Squad overhauled the target in 19.5 overs losing six wickets.The hosts needed 20 runs from their last two overs, and Malki Madara played an explosive six-ball 16 to guide her side to victory.Senarathne and Imika Mendis had laid the foundation for the win with a 33-run opening stand. Senarathne scored 27 runs off 37 balls, while Mendis made 17 facing 21 deliveries.Sandeepani contributed 19 runs.Kritika Marasini, Kabita Joshi, captain Indu Barma and Sabnam Rai took a wicket apiece for Nepal.Earlier, Nepal opted to bat first after winning the toss and posted 106-7 from their 20 overs.Kabita Kunwar top-scored for Nepal with 29 runs off 34 balls. Skipper Barma provided the next best score, hitting 28 off 43.The duo also put on a 32-run stand for the second wicket after opener Shamjhana Khadka departed making 11 in the 2.5 overs.Rubina Chhetri (6), Kabita Joshi (4), Dolly Bhatta (1) and Bindu Rawal (8) could not do much with the bat.Dewmi Vihanga was the pick of Sri Lanka Development Squad bowling, taking 3-20. Sandeepani took 2-13, while Tharika Sewwandi and Sandinu Nisansala pocketed one wicket each.Nepal had lost their first practice match by 33 runs on Tuesday.Nepal play their third and final warm up game against the same opponents next Tuesday.The preparatory series will serve as Nepal’s preparation for the upcoming 2024 ACC Women’s T20 Asia Cup, which is set to take place from July 19 to July 28 in Dambulla.Nepal, drawn in Group A, will open their Asia Cup against the United Arab Emirates on July 19. They play their next group matches against 2012 and 2016 runners-up Pakistan on July 21 and holders and record seven-time champions India on July 23.Group B includes 2018 champions Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Malaysia and Thailand.Nepal are making their third appearance at the Women’s Asia Cup.They previously played the biennial competition in 2012 in China and 2016 in Thailand.The top two teams from each group will progress to the semi-finals, which will be played on July 26.The final will be played on July 28. \nDefending champions Argentina booked their place in the Copa America final after goals from Julian Alvarez and Lionel Messi gave them a 2-0 win over Canada in Tuesday’s semi-final in New Jersey.Argentina have won a joint-record 15 Copa titles and reached the final six times in the past eight editions but Canada caused them problems in the opening 20 minutes, Jacob Shaffelburg twice shooting wide from promising positions.After soaking up the early pressure Argentina went ahead when Rodrigo De Paul played through Alvarez, who ghosted in between two defenders to score with a tidy finish in the 22nd minute.2022 World Cup winners Argentina gradually took control of the match and Messi had a chance to double their lead in the 44th minute as he created space in the box with silky footwork before lashing his effort wide.Canada nearly snatched an equaliser against the run of play in first-half stoppage time as Jonathan David sneaked in ahead of his marker to get on the end of a long throw, but his close-range shot was hit straight at goalkeeper Emiliano Martinez.Messi then scored Argentina’s second in the 51st minute when he stuck out a boot to divert Enzo Fernandez's shot from the edge of the area past Canada goalkeeper Maxime Crepeau.The goal moved Messi to joint fifth in the all-time Copa America scoring charts, level with Peru’s Paolo Guerrero and Chile’s Eduardo Vargas on 14.The 37-year-old’s 109th goal for Argentina also saw him surpass Iran’s Ali Daei on the all-time international scoring charts. Messi is second behind Cristiano Ronaldo, who has scored 130 goals for Portugal.Despite their two-goal cushion, Argentina had a nervy finish to the match as Canada substitute Tani Oluwaseyi tested Martinez with a crisp shot in the 89th minute before directing a glancing header wide a minute later.Argentina will take on either Uruguay or Colombia, who meet on Wednesday, in the final in Florida on Sunday. \nSpain struck twice in five minutes in a pulsating first half to secure a 2-1 comeback win over France on Tuesday as a record-breaking goal from teenager Lamine Yamal and a Dani Olmo effort propelled them into the Euro 2024 final.The 16-year-old Yamal cancelled out Randal Kolo Muani’s opener with a sublime shot in the 21st minute to become the youngest scorer in a Euro or World Cup before Olmo added another in the 25th for his third goal in the knockout stage.The Spaniards, who have won every game of the tournament so far, confirmed their favourites tag with another display of attacking football, especially in the first half, that is a far cry from the tiki-taka passing game that earned them world and European titles more than a decade ago.“I’m very happy to have made it to the final,” said man-of-the-match Yamal. “Now the most important thing is to win it. We were in a difficult moment, you wouldn’t expect a goal so soon.”“I wanted to put it in where it went in, and I’m very happy. I’m happy and content with the victory. I want to win, win and win,” added the teenager.They will now face the winners of Wednesday’s match between England and Netherlands in the final in Berlin on Sunday as they hunt a record-breaking fourth European crown.It was a anti-climactic end to France’s tournament, although the 2022 World Cup finalists never lived up to expectations in Germany with a very low conversion rate that carried into the semi-final.“Spain proved tonight that they are a very good team. We were fortunate to open the scoring, but they caused us problems because they were superior in terms of control,” said France coach Didier Deschamps.“Tonight they showed all their qualities. We were... perhaps a little less fresh, which led to some technical waste, particularly in the build-up of the game. We didn’t push forward often enough.”Spain had an early chance when Yamal, the youngest player to feature in a World Cup or Euro semi-final, floated a cross to the far post but Fabian Ruiz headed over the bar.FRANCE GOALFrance did better from an almost identical move in the ninth minute with Kylian Mbappe, playing without a mask after breaking his nose earlier in the tournament, crossing for Kolo Muani to head in their first goal from open play at Euro 2024.But the Spaniards, who were missing suspended Dani Carvajal and Robin Le Normand as well as injured Pedri, quickly turned the game around.Yamal curled a stunning left-footed effort from 25 metres in off the post to break another record held by Brazil great Pele, as the youngest scorer in a Euro or World Cup.Before France had any time to recover Olmo completed their lightning-quick comeback in the 25th with a shot that was deflected in by France’s Jules Kounde.France, who had only conceded one goal in their previous five games in the tournament, upped the tempo after the break and had chances through Mbappe and Theo Hernandez.But they could not carve out an equaliser with Spain, pulling back and successfully soaking up the pressure. \nIndia’s Supreme Court granted interim bail on Friday to opposition leader and Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal in a graft case, but he will stay in jail due to his arrest in another case.Kejriwal was arrested in March by the Enforcement Directorate (ED), India’s financial crime-fighting agency, over alleged corruption in the city’s alcohol sales policy.A fierce critic of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and a former anti-corruption crusader, Kejriwal, 55, denies any wrongdoing and calls the case politically motivated.His lawyers had challenged his arrest in the top court, which referred the matter to a larger bench while giving him temporary relief.“Given that right to life and liberty is sacrosanct, and Arvind Kejriwal has suffered incarceration for over 90 days ... we direct that Arvind Kejriwal will be released on interim bail,” Justice Sanjiv Khanna said.However, Kejriwal remains in detention because of his arrest last month by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), India’s federal police, in another corruption case related to the Delhi liquor policy.His counsel Vivek Jain told Indian news agency ANI that he will seek his release on bail in the CBI case at the Delhi High Court on July 17.Kejriwal’s decade-old Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) has quickly risen in mainstream politics and voted to power in Delhi and in the northern state of Punjab, but its clout is still relatively smaller than older parties.He was previously granted temporary bail by the top court for three weeks until June 2 to campaign in national elections. \nUkraine on Thursday urged NATO allies to lift restrictions on its use of long-range weapons against targets in Russia, saying that would be “game-changer” in its war with Moscow, while China slammed NATO criticism of its support for Russia as biased and malicious.NATO members issued a declaration in support of Ukraine at a summit in Washington on Wednesday, promising additional aid and pledging to back its “irreversible path” to NATO membership.“At this summit we are turning a corner and putting in place the foundations for Ukraine to prevail,” NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg told a news conference after a three-day meeting in Washington of the 32 NATO states.“Today, we send a strong message of unity and resolve to Moscow that violence and intimidation do not pay, and that Ukraine can count on NATO now for the long haul.”Zelenskiy earlier called on allies to preserve their unified support of Ukraine and said new aid had to be delivered quickly.“If we want to win, if we want to prevail, to save our country and to defend it, we need to lift all the limitations,” he said.Zelenskiy’s cabinet chief Andryi Yermak told a public forum Russia had no restrictions on its use of weapons and it would be “a real game-changer” if Ukraine’s allies could lift all limits on the use of those they supply to Ukraine.NATO members have taken different approaches to how Ukraine can use weapons they donate. Some have made clear Kyiv can use them to strike targets deep inside Russia while the United States has taken a narrower approach, allowing its weapons to be used only just inside Russia’s border against targets supporting Russian military operations in Ukraine.Biden told the press conference the United States had allowed Zelenskiy to use American weapons in a limited way within Russia’s borders.Biden said he and US military and intelligence officials were making decisions on “a day-to-day basis on how far they should go in. That’s a logical thing to do.’The United States and its allies have used this week's summit to try to project unity in the face of what they see as a rising threat to Europe from Russia and China.However, NATO member Hungary said ahead of a meeting of NATO members with partners from the so-called Indo-Pacific Four - Australia, Japan, New Zealand and South Korea - that it does not want NATO to become an “anti-China” bloc, and will not support it doing so.Hungary’s Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto also told Hungarian state television that Ukraine’s admission to the military alliance would weaken unity in the group.Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban irked other NATO members with surprise visits to Kyiv, Moscow and Beijing in the past two weeks on a self-styled “peace mission”. He and Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump will meet on Thursday at the latter’s Florida home, according to three people with knowledge of the matter.Orban’s meeting in Moscow with Russian President Vladimir Putin in particular angered some fellow NATO allies, who said the trip handed legitimacy to Putin’s claims to Ukrainian territory seized since Russia’s 2022 invasion.Biden’s national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, told a public forum he would not speculate on whether Orban’s trip to Moscow was coordinated with Trump, Biden’s rival in the November US election, but said the Ukrainians had grave misgivings about any effort to negotiate a peace deal without them.“So whatever adventurism is being undertaken without Ukraine’s consent or support is not something that’s consistent with our policy, the foreign policy of the United States,” he said.ANGRY WORDS FROM CHINAWednesday’s NATO declaration included sharp words about China, calling it “a decisive enabler” of Russia’s war in Ukraine, and said Beijing continues to pose systemic challenges to Europe and to security.China’s Foreign Ministry said the declaration was biased and “sowing discord” and its mission to the European Union described it as being “full of Cold War mentality and belligerent rhetoric, and China-related content full of provocations, lies, incitement and smears.”At the news conference, Stoltenberg recalled language in the declaration by saying that “China cannot continue to fuel the largest military conflict in Europe without this impacting Beijing's interests and reputation.”China has repeatedly lashed out at NATO criticisms and has warned against its expansion into the Indo-Pacific.Japan, South Korea, New Zealand and Australia have forged stronger ties with NATO amid rising concerns over China’s pressure on rival claimants in disputed waters in the region and on democratic Taiwan, the global hub of cutting-edge chip production, which Beijing claims as its own. \nResidents of Gaza City were trapped in houses and bodies lay uncollected in the streets under an intense new Israeli assault on Thursday, even as Washington pushed for a peace deal at talks in Egypt and Qatar.Hamas militants say a heavy Israeli assault on Gaza City this week could wreck efforts to finally end the war just as negotiations have entered the home stretch.Home to more than a quarter of Gaza’s residents before the war, Gaza City was destroyed during the first weeks of fighting last year, but hundreds of thousands of Palestinians have returned to homes in the ruins. They have now once again been ordered out by the Israeli military.The Gaza health ministry said it had reports of people trapped and others killed inside their houses in the Tel Al Hawa and Sabra districts of Gaza City, and rescuers could not reach them.The Civil Emergency Service said it estimated that at least 30 people had been killed in the Tel Al-Hawa and Rimal areas and it could not recover bodies from the streets there.Despite army instructions on Wednesday to residents of Gaza City that they can use two “safe routes” to head south, many residents refused to heed the order. Some posted a hashtag on social media: “We are not leaving”.“We will die but not leave to the south. We have tolerated starvation and bombs for nine months and we are ready to die as martyrs here,” said Mohammad Ali, 30, reached by text message.Ali, whose family has relocated several times within the city, said they had been running short of food, water and medicine.“The occupation bombs Gaza City as if the war was restarting. We hope there will be a ceasefire soon, but if not then is God’s will.”Withdrawal from ShejaiaJust east of Gaza City in the Shejaia suburb, residents were returning on foot to a desolate moonscape of destroyed buildings after Israeli forces withdrew following a two-week offensive there.The territory’s main cemetery had been bulldozed by the army. People wheeled supplies on the back of bicycles across rubble-strewn tracks, passing the remains of burnt-out and blasted Israeli armoured vehicles.“We have returned to Shejaia after 15 days. You can see the destruction. They spared nothing, even trees, there was a lot of greenery in this area. What is the guilt of stones and trees? And what is my guilt as a civilian?” resident Hatem Tayeh told Reuters in the ruins.“There are bodies of civilian people. What is the guilt of the civilian? Who are you fighting?”Israel launched its assault on the Gaza Strip last year after Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel, killing 1,200 people and capturing more than 250 hostages according to Israeli tallies.Since then, Israel’s assault has killed more than 38,000 according to medical authorities in Gaza.At the southern edge of the enclave in Rafah near the border with Egypt, where tanks have been operating in most of the city since May, residents said the army continued to blow up houses in the western and central areas, amid fighting with Hamas, Islamic Jihad, and other smaller factions.Palestinian health officials said four people were killed, including a child, in an Israeli air strike in Tel Al-Sultan in western Rafah.The Israeli military said earlier on Thursday around five rockets fired from the Rafah area were successfully intercepted.The negotiations in Qatar and Egypt follow important concessions last week from Hamas, which agreed that a truce could begin and some hostages released without Israel first agreeing to end the war.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who faces opposition within his right-wing cabinet to any deal that would halt the war until Hamas is vanquished, says a deal must allow Israel to resume fighting until it meets all its objectives.Two Hamas officials contacted by Reuters had no immediate comment on the content of the ongoing talks, led by Egypt, Qatar, and the United States.“There will be a meeting today between Hamas and the mediators to check on what responses they have received from the occupation,” said one Palestinian official close to the mediation, without elaboration. \nNepal’s book market is no stranger to the popular Bangladeshi-Swedish writer Taslima Nasrin. Almost all of her books have been translated into Nepali, but Nasrin herself says that they are all unauthorised translations. “All books [Nepali translations] are pirated versions,” Nasrin told the Post in a Whatsapp conversation. Nasrin, who is currently in exile in India after facing death threats in Bangladesh following the publication of her novel Lajja (Shame), said that she or her publishers have never allowed anyone the right to translate her books into Nepali. “I don’t know of any such Nepali publishers. No one asked for permission and no one has paid [me] royalty.”Translating and publishing books without permission from authors or publishers is a punishable crime. But Nepal’s book market is full of such unauthorised translations and prints of books written by the who’s who of the world literature. Such endeavours haven’t just hurt the authors but also the readers, says Ajit Baral, publisher of the Kathmandu-based Fineprint publication. “These translations are poor,” Baral says. “Tomes with 1200–1300 pages have been trimmed to 200–300 pages. An example is the biography of Bill Clinton.”Another popular book that has seen unauthorised Nepali translation is the biography of Steve Jobs by Walter Isaacson.“We have no official deal in place for a [Nepali] translation of Steve Jobs,” Peppa Mignone, associate agent of the CAA, the translation authority of the biography, said in an email interview with the Post.The book’s Nepali translation is published by Panchpokhari Publication House. The translated book identifies the translator thus: “Achyut Koirala, who has a master’s in English literature, is primarily a journalist. He is currently affiliated with Nagarik daily. He keeps a close tab on international history, politics and culture and has written scripts and dialogues for half a dozen Nepali films. He has published over a dozen non-fiction books.”Koirala, who admits to the unauthorised translation, claims that he hasn’t just translated the book but has also done ‘creative writing’ with it.‘Rich Dad Poor Dad’, written by Robert Kiyosaki and Sharon Lechter, is among the books that’s perennially on the bestseller list across the world. Upon investigation, the Post found three Nepali translations of the book—all unauthorised. One of them is translated by Dilip Kumar Shrestha and published by the same firm, the Panchpokhari Publication House. Another Nepali iteration of the book is published by Book For All publication and translated by Kopila MD. Yet another Nepali version is translated by one Sudheer Dixit and published by Plata Publication, Kathmandu.In an email conversation with the Post, Ronson Taylor, who oversees the international rights at The Rich Dad Company, said, “At this point in time, we do not have a relationship with an established publisher in the [Nepali] language market. If there are any Rich Dad Poor Dad books currently for sale in the Nepali market, they are pirated.”Basanta Thapa, a writer and translator, says that many books are being translated of late to make easy money. “But how would the quality of these unauthorised translations be!” Thapa wonders. “Readers who haven’t read the original wouldn’t know the faults in the translated versions.” Thapa says that any translator worth his salt aims to ‘recreate’ a book and it takes much work to do that.Taslima’s books are the major victimsTaslima’s memoir Uttal Hawa has been translated into Nepali as ‘Sangharsha’, literally Struggle, and is published by Khoji Publication House. Even though the book in its cover claims that it is an authorised translation from the English version Wild Wind, it is a pirated one. The book is translated by Bikash Basnet and edited by Bhogiraj Chamling. A revised version of the book is edited by Sangeet Srota (Yam Bahadur Chhetri).The same publication house has also published the Nepali translation of the book’s sequel as ‘Prem ra Jeevan’. Publisher Sushil Chalise says that while he is aware that one needs to receive permission from the author or the publisher to translate a book, his efforts to contact Taslima were unsuccessful. Therefore, he had published the version the translator made available to him. Translator Basnet, too, admits he translated the book without Taslima’s permission. “About a decade back, we didn’t know how to ask for permission,” he said.Nepal has the Copyright Act (2002) in place. Before it, there was the The Patent, Design and Trade Mark Act, 2022 (1965) that included intellectual property in its 2006 revision. Even the Muluki Ain (Civil Code) of 1910 BS had a provision about copyright. Moreover, it goes without saying that translating somebody else’s work without permission is immoral.Likewise, Indigo Ink Pvt Ltd has published a Nepali translation of Taslima’s anthology of essays No Country for Women as ‘Aaimai ko Kunai Desh Chhaina’. The book is translated by Krishna Giri and edited by Pramod Pradhan. “I have no idea about the agreement between the publisher and translator,” Pradhan, who is also a children’s book writer, says. “I just copy-edited it upon request.”Bishnukumar Poudel, publisher of Indigo Ink, however, claims that he is still trying to take translation rights for the book. “We translated the book long ago,” he says. “We are still trying to get translation rights.”Indigo is also publishing unauthorised translations under its imprints All Book Store Pvt Ltd, Book for All and Plata Publication. It has published two versions of Rich Dad Poor Dad under those shadow imprints. But Plata Publication is not registered in the Company Registrar’s Office.Pradhan says that many foreign books have had unauthorised translations in Nepali and their quality is poor. Those books are translated not from the original language but from a second or third language, so these translations are bound to have problems, he says. “After I learned that those were unauthorised translations, I have stopped editing them,” Pradhan said.Indian author Shiv Khera’s You Can Win has been translated into Nepali by Bloomsbury India and has granted the distribution rights to Ekta Books. But the book’s unauthorised translations are also found in the market and they don’t even mention the name of the publisher and translator. What is interesting is they mention that it’d be illegal to republish the book, or an excerpt of it, without the author’s permission.The Nepali translation of the book, which was poorly written and rife with inaccuracies, had landed the publisher at court. After a complaint was filed at the District Court Kathmandu in 2066BS on the charge that the publisher violated the copyrights and economic rights, the court had issued a verdict on Mangsir 11 that year, charging a fine of Rs10,000, Rs20,000 and Rs30,000 to the defendants Netra Prasad Pokharel, Narayan Prasad Bhusal, and Bhagwati Risal and Bishnu Silwal, respectively.Baral, the Fineprint publisher, says that international publishers wouldn’t demand much for translation rights given Nepal’s small market, but Nepali publishers do not bother to reach out to them. “Publishers who put out unauthorised translations and sell them at 50 percent discount have troubled publishers like us,” he said.Fineprint has published authorised translated versions of books such as Leaving Microsoft to Change the World by John Wood, Healed by Manisha Koirala, and Hippie by Paulo Coelho. The publication house is also set to release the Nepali translation of Israeli historian Yuval Noah Harari’s bestseller Sapiens. Translated into Nepali by Dinesh Kafle, the book’s translation right was acquired at the cost of USD1300, Baral said. Likewise, the publication acquired the translation rights of Sadhguru’s Inner Engineering at IRS93,000, he added.Baral says that publication of unauthorised translations is an immoral and illegal work. “This phenomenon not just hampers Nepal’s fledgling book publishing industry but also tarnishes the country’s reputation in the global market,” Baral said.Thapa, the writer and translator, points out the lack of regulatory mechanisms in the country. “We don’t have an agency that regulates the quality of translations being done,” he says. “Nobody compares the translation with the original. We need a dedicated authority to enhance the quality of translation.” Universities, Nepal Academy and other stakeholders can play a role to uplift the translation sector, he adds.One’s pain, another’s pleasureWhen the author Suketu Mehta was travelling through Mumbai, a young man approached him with a handful of books while his vehicle was stuck in traffic. Brandishing Maximum City, written by none other than Mehta himself, the young man requested the author to buy a copy. Suketu leafed through the book and said, “This is a pirated copy and I’m the author of this book.” The youth wasn’t bothered and replied, “Okay, you can buy it at a discount.”This anecdote was shared to the Post by Mehta’s friend, the author and professor Amitava Kumar, in an email exchange.Most of these pirated books are imported into Nepal from India while the retailers of original books are finding themselves increasingly in trouble. “We sell original copies but many readers doubt us as well, given the ubiquity of pirated versions,” says Anjan Shrestha, operator of Education Book House, Jamal.Ramchandra Timothy, chair of Thapathali-based Ekta Books Pvt Ltd, said that the phenomenon of piracy has tarnished Nepal’s image internationally. “There was a time when Bangladesh would be known as ‘piracy king’,” he said. “Now there's a risk Nepal would take the crown.”As tax increases, so does piracyThe government decision to impose a 10 percent tax on book imports in fiscal year 2019-20 led to a proliferation of pirated book markets, booksellers say. After the decision, booksellers started to cut back on imports and that led to the entry of a new crop of pirated booksellers, a trader in Kathmandu says. But following widespread backlash, then finance minister Bishnu Paudel struck down the policy.“After the government’s decision, we stopped importing books for a while,” says Shrestha of Education Books. “The import of books went down for about two years. Then the pirates stepped in to fill the gap. It was about that time that pirated copies of biographies and memoirs of Obamas and Jai Shettys became omnipresent in the market.”Pirated copies of classics by Roald Dahl and JK Rowling also made an entry in the Nepali market. Then the phenomenon only saw a rise.Since the customs department does not levy duty on foreign books and also does not care to differentiate between the pirated and original copies, unauthorised books have found a safe haven in Nepali market.The government doesn’t levy any customs duty on books and newspapers published by foreign publishers abroad. The importers should only pay Rs565 at the customs points. But Nepali publishers have to pay 10 percent tax to import books printed in India.James Taylor, director of Communications and Freedom to Publish of the International Publishers Association, says that the government, publishers, writers and readers should join hands to control widespread piracy. “The government should realise that book publishing and reading culture contribute to the country’s economy as well,” he said, adding that the government should seize pirated books and close websites that sell pirated ebooks.Nandan Jha, executive vice chair of Penguin Random House India’s sales, production and business department, says that piracy has emerged as a big challenge for publishers of late and has harmed the authors, publishers, distributors, printers, readers and other stakeholders. “To confront piracy, all the stakeholders should launch a special joint effort,” Jha told the Post in an email exchange.Piracy has proliferated in the Nepali market to such an extent that the publishers of such books and unauthorised translations keep whatever ISBN numbers they like, often conflicting with other books, and still get off scot free. If scanned or searched on the internet, the ISBN number gives details on the author of the book, what the book is about, and its price, among others.Bijay Sharma, information officer at TU Library, says, “Keeping ISBN number at one’s will is illegal. If anyone files a complaint, we can punish them.”By the lawThe Muluki Ain-1910 BS had mandated that a publisher take permission of Gorkha Bhasa Prakashini Samiti before publishing any material. The Copyrights Act came into effect in 2022 BS and was amended in 2054 BS. In 2059 BS, a new Act was promulgated and it is still effective now. Authorities are currently working to amend the Act to give the registrar’s office more autonomy regarding copyright.According to the 2059 BS Act, copyright violations are considered government cases. In such cases, plaintiffs should file a complaint with the police. The Act’s clause 25 has various conditions that amount to violation of copyright. The Act’s subclause A says that if a publisher produces or copies material in writing or sound and sells or distributes it, it amounts to violation of copyright.Likewise, the Act’s clause 26 prevents selling of unauthorised material. The clause restricts the ‘importation of copies of work or sound recording, either made in a foreign country or sourced otherwise, into Nepal for business purpose shall not be permitted if preparation of such copies would be considered illegal if they were prepared in Nepal.’If anyone infringes upon protected rights, they are liable to punishment but the provision’s implementation remains lax.The law gives the authority to district court to take legal action against copyright violators.Advocate Parshuram Koirala says that if the government becomes more proactive, it can punish violators on the basis of the 2059 BS Act and thereby control the phenomenon of intellectual theft and copyright violations. “Creation is a crucial part of humanity’s benefit,” he says. “If intellectual property is not protected effectively, then there’d be no inspiration to create something.”Bal Bahadur Mukhiya, a professor at Nepal Law Campus, suggests the inclusion of rules about digital piracy in law, and also the clauses of various related international treaties and agreements that Nepal is part of.“In the US, a teacher or professor should pay a certain revenue even to photocopy a chapter of some text for teaching purposes,” Mukhiya says. “But in Nepal, those who photocopy an entire book and sell it go scot free.”(This report is prepared in collaboration with the Centre for Investigative Journalism, Nepal.) \nBharat Budha, chair of Putha Uttarganga Rural Municipality’s ward 10, knows that many youths from his village have made it to the United States via ‘tallo bato’—backdoor route—and that many are still on the way. He also knows that eight of them have been deported from the country and that they have lost a cumulative Rs45 million in the process. The deported youths say that they returned home empty-handed after facing unspeakable ordeals and lost Rs6 million each on average.The Tak village in Rukum East—a close-knit settlement of 425 houses—was considered the Maoists’ ‘base area’ during the insurgency. Village youths who reached the US through illegal routes and got deported have lost an estimated Rs40 million. The number of those who returned without completing the journey and the amount they lost remain unknown.To get to the US, the youths have taken loans at up to 36 percent interest per annum from their relatives and village landowners. In Tak village, at least one person each from half of the households has gone abroad, Budha said. “Youths started going to America about six-seven years ago,” he said. “If they could gather enough money, the whole village would try to go to the US.” Budha’s own son had reached the US illegally in 2017, spending Rs3.2 million.During the insurgency, outsize slogans of revolution would adorn the walls of houses in the village. Hoping for a better life, people from all walks of life helped out the Maoists. But now, village youths are paying the agents to illegally get to the US—a country that the Maoists used to call their ‘enemy’, an ‘imperialistic force’. This has cost the Tak village much and in multiple ways.Death of a dreamSome of the deported youths have chosen to flee the village altogether, burdened with debt and creditors’ pressure. At least five such families have already left, said a resident. The family of Ram Budha was one of them. On April 28, 2015, Ram, who had returned to Nepal after working in Malaysia for eight years, took the illegal route to the US. He travelled through arduous trails for months and finally arrived in the country. Upon reaching the country, he was detained and had to stay at the detention camp for 27 months. When his refugee application was rejected, he was deported to Nepal in mid-December 2019. He lost Rs4.5 million in the process. He now owes over Rs6 million to creditors. “After the creditors began to put pressure on me, I couldn’t live in the village peacefully,” said Ram, who currently runs a vegetable farm in Tarakeshwar, Kathmandu.While those who got to the US through illegal routes and fortunately got refugee status there narrate their stories with pride, those who have been deported or returned from half-way have tragic tales to tell.Nanda Kala Gharti, who lives in a small stone house on the upper flank of Tak village, spends her days in melancholy. Her husband, Dhanlal, had chosen to take the illegal route to the US, and Nanda Kala, a mother of four, is living with the repercussions of his decision. Dhanlal had got into the US after a six-month long arduous journey and was detained immediately. He had to spend four years in the detention camp, before he was deported to Nepal. He had already lost Rs6 million.Nanda Kala said they now have an insurmountable crisis in their hands. Pointing to her son, she exclaimed, “When will he grow up, go abroad and pay back the loans!”Dhanlal himself tried to go to Croatia once and spent 15 days in Kathmandu for the process. But after he was turned down, he returned home dejected. “Now we will submit the passport to another agent [for Dhanlal’s trip abroad],” Nanda Kala said. “There’s no point staying here.”Stories that echo each otherThe situation in Sisne Rural Municipality is similar to that of Putha Uttarganga. Here, one can hear plenty of stories of those who have tried to go to the US and those who are fighting refugee cases there. Krishna Regmi, chair of the rural municipality, personally knows seven people who have been deported from the US.Gangaram Khadka, a resident of Sisne-3, runs a bee and chicken farm. Like other young men in his village, Khadka had headed off to the US via an illegal route on 27 March, 2018. He had reached the US via the New Delhi-Moscow-Barcelona-Bogota-Panama-Costa Rica-Nicaragua-Honduras-Guatemala-Mexico route. When he finally arrived in the US, he was detained and had to spend 11 months in detention. He was deported on 15 March, 2019. He had handed over Rs3.2 millions to the agent and spent Rs2 million to fight the case to become a refugee. “It’s not possible for me to pay back the loan while working in Nepal,” he said. “I aim to pay back some interest and head off abroad again.”For six months after Khadka was deported, he had anxiety and headache, he said, adding the three people from his village who were deported like him are also struggling with their mental health.Tikaram Pun, a 40-year-old resident of Bohora village in Musikot-4, is also haunted by his past journey. In September 2017, he reached the US after crossing 17 countries with the help of organised human traffickers. Of the 41 people in his group, 31 were from Rukum East and Rukum West, he said. Pun, who was detained on arrival in the US, spent 24 months in a detention camp. His refugee application was also refused and so he was deported along with eight other Nepalis. “When I returned, I started having mental health problems. I still suffer from them,” he said. Pun is under pressure from creditors and relatives to pay back the Rs9.2 million loan he had taken for the task.Those who died on the wayA group of 10 Bangladeshis and seven Nepalis, including Rupak Bohora of Bafikot-3 in Rukum West, were on a mission to reach Costa Rica through Colombia, Caribbean Coast, Capuragana and Panama. But while they were crossing a sea, their boat capsized. As many as 12 died in the incident, including six Nepalis. Rupak’s wife, Geeta, learned about the incident only after six days, on 25 June, 2021.“I still don’t know what exactly happened,” said Geeta, who had been married off at age 19 and is now a mother of two daughters. The only thing she knows is that Rupak has died and she is now all alone. And that she has Rs5 million in loan taken for Rupak’s trip. She showed a picture of her husband on her phone to this scribe and said, “I only have memories.”Lack of political will and legal remediesThe concrete bridge over Chewang river is on the edge of Tak village. On the walls of the bridge are paintings of political theorists like Marx, Engels, Lenin, Stalin and Mao, and the iconic slogan, ‘Workers of the world, unite!’, below them. But the slogan appears to be at odds with life in the village. Given the phenomenon of illegal travels to the US through the help of organised human traffickers, the whole village appears to be emptying. Neither the local governments are concerned about the phenomenon nor are the political parties paying attention.Puniraj Gharti, chair of Putha Uttarganga Rural Municipality, said though the trend is worrying, there’s nothing he can do. “How could we stop them from making the trip when they are struggling to make a living in the village?” he said.Krishna Regmi, chair of Sisne Rural Municipality, said that the vicious cycle of poverty started after marijuana farming was banned in the country. Then the Maoist insurgency added to the woe, forcing youths to migrate. The signing of the peace agreement in 2006 didn’t herald any change in the economy either and youths are struggling to get jobs. Organised human traffickers are cashing in on this sorry state of affairs, Regmi said. “Meter byajis [usurious lenders] are also promoting this phenomenon,” he added.The phenomenon is equally rife in Dang’s Tulsipur and Ghorahi. Ramesh Kumar Pandey, chair of Ghorai-15, says that even though many heading to the US are swindled, no complaints are filed at the ward office. “Only those who attempt to go to Saudi Arabia or Qatar file the complaints,” he said.One can infer from Pandey’s statements that the families of such illegal travellers don’t want to publicise the ordeals of their family members. On the one hand, agents threaten them to not publicise the issue; on the other, they fear they themselves would be punished by law.According to the Anti-Human Trafficking Bureau, as many as 178 Nepalis, including 174 men, have been deported from the US in the five fiscal years after 2018-19. Of them, the highest 49 are from Rukum while 37 are from Dang. The data doesn’t include those who returned after making it to the half-way or those who have been fighting the legal battle in the US for refugee status. But this data is enough to show that many such youths are from the ‘base areas’ of the Maoist insurgency.SSP Jeevan Shrestha, chief of the bureau, said that data on the number of such victims and the amounts they have spent is hard to collect since complaints are rarely filed with the police. “This is human trafficking but for a lack of law, we are still compelled to launch the cases as per Human Trafficking and Transportation (Control) Act 2074 BS,” Shrestha said. “The Act provides a maximum penalty of Rs250,000 for the offenders and 50 percent of that as compensation to the victims.” Without specific law, police also invoke the theft and organised crime act to punish the offenders, he added.On the one hand, police receive no complaints; on the other, the phenomenon sees no control.Bhaskar Gautam, a political scientist, says the rise in cases of human trafficking in the insurgency’s ‘base areas’ is due to the political system’s abject failure.While the Maoists raised issues related to livelihood, nationalism and a new kind of democracy to fuel their war machine, after the peace process, it is livelihoods that have been hit the hardest, Gautam said. “The traditional way of life and economy took a hit during the insurgency,” he said. “Developments after the peace process also failed to address that. What sprang up was organised human trafficking.”(Mahesh KC in Rukum East and Durgalal KC in Dang contributed to this report.)This report is prepared in collaboration with the Center for Investigative Journalism-Nepal. \nGyanumaya BK had been suffering from severe backaches for a while. The resident of Pokhara-15, BK visited the Metrocity Hospital in Srijanachowk seeking treatment five months ago. The 69-year-old, who works as a labourer, has already spent over Rs50,000 on follow-up checkups and medications.BK spent eight days in the hospital in January and has been paying off loans she had taken to pay her bills and for follow-up visits to the hospital. Had BK been aware of the Health Facility Operation Standards-2020, which private hospitals must adhere to, she wouldn’t have had to borrow money to pay her medical bills. As per the regulations, hospitals must set aside 10 percent of their total beds to the underprivileged and needy.“I didn’t know hospitals were required to provide free treatment to those who can’t afford hospital stays,” BK said. “But even if I did, I would have to fight to get the service as the hospital won’t willingly offer me the service.”The Pokhara-based 50-bed hospital’s Chief Executive Officer Gyan Prasad Aryal admits that his hospital does not adhere to the mandate. “We don’t have explicit information from the health ministry on the Health Facility Operation Standards-2020,” said Aryal. “Moving forward, we will follow the instructions.” The hospital authorities say they give a 10-15 percent discount on the final hospital bill as opposed to dedicating 10 percent of their beds and free treatment and medications to the less privileged. Hospitals with 15 beds come under the jurisdiction of the local units while those with up to 50 beds fall under the ambit of the Provincial Health Directorate. Likewise, the Provincial Health Ministry oversees health facilities with over 50 beds.However, no regulatory body has data on whether health facilities are following government rules, especially Health Facility Operation Standards-2020. But it is an open secret that most private hospitals in Pokhara are not following the regulations.Pokhara Municipality Health Department Officer Yadunath Baral, Kaski District Health Officer Bhim Prasad Poudel, and Province Health Director Khim Bahadur Khadka all admit that local hospitals disregard the regulations. “Our monitoring and inspection is also lax, that’s why most hospitals ignore the rules,” he said. He says lack of manpower hampers effective inspection. “Our manpower is enough to conduct inspections in other districts, but not in Kaski, which has many private hospitals,” he said. “We need more people for that”. According to Baral, although the hospitals claim to offer a certain discount on final bills to the needy, they are unable to show the record of the discounts provided. “The hospitals claim they give discounts, but most hospitals have not even been able to show us the proof,” said Khadka. “Legal actions should be taken against the hospitals that fail to submit a monthly report on the free services for the poor. More importantly, they must be liable for flouting government standards that aim to benefit the poor.” The Provincial Health Directorate also does not have any data on the directive’s implementation at hospitals with more than 50 beds.The department’s chief of health services Dr Ramesh KC says that they have been working on updating information of health services in the Gandaki region. “Hospitals have failed to submit their mandatory monthly reports. We will seek that information when they come for new permits or permit renewal,” KC said. There are 27 privately-owned hospitals within the Pokhara Metropolitan City and 39 in the Gandaki region. Bharatpur Metropolitan City in Chitwan in Bagmati Province is also called the ‘medical city’  as it is home to 23 private hospitals with a total of 1,200 beds. Additionally, there are multiple large-scale government hospitals and two medical colleges—Chitwan Medical College and College of Medical Sciences—that also provide medical services. Had the Health Facility Operation Standards-2020 been followed by the 23 private hospitals, 120 patients would have received free health services every year, according to Durgadutta Chapagain, chief of the Chitwan Health Office.“Although the hospitals claim they provide the services, none have been able to provide convincing proof. Instead, we found them giving such discounts to patients who are close to hospital operators,” said Chapagain. “Our department validates the permits for new health facilities and re-registrations for hospitals with a 25-bed capacity. We have asked such public health service providers to put up posters or stickers reading ‘Discounts for the needy’ on the hospital premises so that patients know what services they can get on discount.”Meanwhile, Bikram Adhikari, Secretary of the Private Hospitals Coordination Committee in Chitwan, claims that the regulations are impractical. “There are a few services that hospitals can provide free of cost. You cannot expect hospitals to provide all services for free. That’s why there is a need to amend the existing regulations,” said Adhikari.The monitoring bodies’ inaction and lackadaisical approach to ensuring that public health services are accessible and affordable to all makes private hospitals blatantly ignore government mandates.Bharatpur Metropolitan City’s Deputy Mayor Chitrasen Adhikari says that although the metropolis is aware that private hospitals must allocate 10 percent of their beds for free treatment of poor people, the metropolis administration has yet to devise a monitoring mechanism. “We have not taken any steps towards that end, but we will soon,” he said.Just like Pokhara and Chitwan, Biratnagar is also plagued with the same problem. There are 32 private hospitals currently in operation in the metropolis. Deepak Bhattarai, statistical officer at the municipality’s health office, asserts that none of the health facilities met the set requirements. A monthly report submitted by the Biratnagar-based Nobel Medical College and Teaching Hospital, which has 750 beds, stated that the hospital had provided the said concession to more than 400 patients. “However, the report did not clarify how many of the 400 patients were provided free hospital beds and the services that come along with the beds, and how many were given discounts on their hospital bills,” Bhattarai said. “We found that hospital reports also include concessions provided to patients who sought outpatient, emergency, and X-ray services.”The hospital’s director Narayan Dahal claims to be following all government instructions. He says 10 percent hospital beds are set aside for needy patients who are not charged any treatment fees, while 10 percent of service seekers also get discounts.Although the Biratnagar Metropolis has directed all health facilities under its jurisdiction to allocate free beds and provide free services to the needy, inform service seekers about the government-provided services, and submit a list of all patients who have received the services, the directive is ignored more often than followed. According to Bhattarai, medical establishments must get a letter from the local unit before making any upgrades or purchasing any equipment. “But the hospitals have been found presenting fake documents in order to acquire such permits,” he said. “The metropolis has refused such permits to 12 private hospitals in the current fiscal year.”Butwal Sub-Metropolitan City in the Lumbini Province has also taken no concrete step to ensure private hospitals adhere to Health Facility Operation Standards-2020. Despite having the authority to carry out inspections, the sub-metropolis’ apathy has deprived hundreds of needy patients of various government services. The sub-metropolis with 17 wards has more than two dozen big hospitals in the Butwal bazaar area itself. Not one of them adheres to the government’s health regulations. But the sub-metropolis is yet to monitor these hospitals. Yubraj Pandey, chief of Butwal Sub Metropolitan’s health department, says they have been unable to inspect medical institutes due to a lack of a proper set of rules.“I have just been transferred here. Discussions are underway to prepare legal requirements,” he said. Private hospitals in Butwal only began filing their reports two months ago after a joint meeting, informs Chief of the Sub Metropolitan’s Education and Health Department Mitramani Khanal. Twenty-year-old Suraj BK of Sarawal Rural Municipality-2 in West Nawalparasi got into a motorcycle accident on April 26. He suffered injuries on both his legs and was taken to Zenus Hospital and Research Centre in Butwal. Suraj was handed a bill of Rs 70,000 for treatment but he did not have the money to clear the bill and sought the hospital’s help. “The hospital refused to provide any discount. They in fact refused to discharge me. I got my discharge papers only four days later after I paid almost Rs 100,000,” he said. “I had to get a loan to pay the hospital bills as my father, who is a farmer, did not have that kind of money.”Dr Sharda Singh, the hospital director, said Suraj did not qualify for a discount as he did not have a recommendation letter from the local unit. “Patients have to get a recommendation to avail of free services at private hospitals but Suraj could not bring one,” she said. “I was in the hospital bed for four days. I could not have secured a recommendation from the local unit in that state,” said Suraj. Ishwari Prasad Chapagain, a civil society leader of Rupandehi and a member of the Consumer Interest Protection Forum, says private hospitals in Butwal are more interested in making money than helping those in need. “They do not follow government mandates. They act as if they have to bear the expenses of providing free service to the poor when in fact they get tax rebates and such for such services,” he said. “The sub-metropolis also does not do the needful. Everyone is corrupt including the city officials.”  \nThe one lesson Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal seems to have forgotten even as he indulged in all manners of chicanery and machinations to stay in power was the simplest—two can play the same game. In his case, it was actually three but the end result was the same. For a public long wearied of his constant restlessness and the promise of even more instability, the universal reaction to the Oli-Deuba gang up against Dahal was either studied indifference or a feeling that justice has been served.To now be known as the ‘Duplicitous One’ is a big step down from the ‘Fierce One’, the translation of his nom de guerre most commonly used in the heady days when Dahal had just entered mainstream politics. And rather than admit that he had been beaten at his own game, the prime minister has been on a whine, even singing a song about betrayal in love. Most of all, though, warning yet again that regressive forces were becoming active.No record to whine aboutOne just wonders if Dahal(and his minions) now going to town about how the incoming alliance will take the country backward even pause to consider his own record. From engaging in mindless politicking to donning the daura-suruwal to complete his metamorphosis from revolutionary leader to an ordinary politician, what has he done to advance the cause of progressivism that is substantially different from other governments?Since the issue of ‘inclusion’ is one that the Maoists, somewhat justifiably, can be proprietorial over, let us take the case of the different constitutional commissions aimed specifically at furthering that objective. Under ‘Other Commissions’, the 2015 Constitution has provisioned for the National Women Commission, the National Dalit Commission, and the National Inclusion Commission. Following these three are the Adibasi Janajati Commission, the Madheshi Commission, the Tharu Commission, and the Muslim Commission.Why the latter four were not designated as ‘national’ beats reason as does why Tharus were granted a separate commission since, by law, Tharus are also part of the larger Adibasi Janajati grouping. Equally so, why there was no indication of what these ‘non-national’ commissions were to do. Grafted as they were into the draft of the constitution in the wake of the horrific Tikapur incident of August 2015, the political parties were in such a great hurry to assuage those with serious misgivings with the draft constitution that they simply declared that there shall be such-and-such commissions and left it at that. Granted, the Maoists did not have much bargaining heft back in 2015. But they could at least have called for a more comprehensive copy-and-paste job with regard to these commissions. Not that it would have mattered one whit since, over time, all the commissions, ‘national’ or otherwise, have been given nearly the same reduced responsibilities as well as shrinking authority. And, the Maoists have played along without demur. To top it off, even though Dahal has headed the government for the past year and a half, the resource crunch in these commissions, both human and financial, remained wholly unaddressed. These commissions will all be facing an existential threat next year since a review is a constitutional requirement. With barely anything to show over the years, it should come as no surprise if the commissions were written out of the constitution. But it is more likely that the Maoists and other parties will follow the politically expedient path of letting them toothlessly exist as they are.Three ole menHaving said that, we do wonder what kind of political system we live under. All the goings and comings among and between the three major parties, the Nepali Congress, the UML and the Maoists, can hardly be called that. For it was not engagement among parties but just individuals. It is absolutely amazing that for each party, the president alone can decide the way forward. And the office-bearers elected and nominated are then left scrambling for post-facto justifications of their leader’s actions they mostly had no inkling about.Hence, Sher Bahadur Deuba felt no need to take into confidence the party leadership when he decided to back away from the pre-poll understanding with Dahal on who would first lead the government back in 2022. Neither did KP Sharma Oli feel the need to explain to his cadre why he preferred a, b or c as the presidential candidate over x, y and z. Dahal being the self-styled disruptor and heading a party new to democratic politics, obviously would not deign to take anyone’s advice for anything. He now finds no one but himself to blame for the unsavoury situation he has led his party into. The tragedy is that the entire country is being held hostage to the whims of these three men and is likely to be so well into the future.Country doing fineThese men’s efforts to hold back Nepal notwithstanding, we seem to be doing somewhat fine. As mentioned in an earlier piece, national poverty rates have shrunk despite the political dysfunction of the past decade. By one reckoning of the World Bank, measured against the ‘International Poverty Line’ of a per capita income of USD 2.15 per day, poverty has made an exit from Nepal. We will let the economists quibble over these numbers but the fact remains that in spite of the politics, the country is not doing so badly.I would even argue that our democratic space remains open precisely because of the unstable politics we complain so much about. It cannot be just the role of the national character or other such attributes that Nepal is the most open in the region. Just look at the neighbourhood. Each country is in the grip of either a strongman (India, and, till recently, Sri Lanka), or a strongwoman (Bangladesh), or an undemocratic institution (Afghanistan, Myanmar and Pakistan). Our man Oli did try to pull a stunt a la Erdoğan/Orbán/Modi on us when he headed the most powerful government in Nepal’s modern history. But his ambition was cut short by, at times, the force of civil society opposition and, at others, an alert judiciary. We do not know if Oli has tempered his autocratic instincts since. Coalition politics will certainly keep them at abeyance for now. Until the next election, that is. The real test of his and of other leaders will be if they were to lead their party into an emphatic victory. Will we then follow the path of so many other countries of sliding into some form of electoral autocracy? Or will our civil and political institutions be strong enough to withstand any such attempt to undermine them? I am betting on the latter and hoping against hope that I am right. \nAs Iran’s President-elect, Masoud Pezeshkian, continues to receive congratulatory calls from global leaders, he is due to hold discussions with foreign counterparts from July 8, with a swearing-in before the Parliament not scheduled before the first week of August. This does not seem to prevent senior Iranian diplomats from supporting Pezeshkian’s policies (from engaging the West to Afghan refugees, which was a focal point of discussion during the elections). That said, it remains unclear as to how the conservative political regime will respond to his policies, with one scholar referring to over two interactions with the Ayatollah, speculating Pezeshkian to have received some directions/guidance on the same. On enquiring over Pezeshkian’s interaction with the Ayatollah, one IRGC commander acknowledged Pezeshkian received direction to continue the foreign policy initiatives of his predecessor, the late former president Ebrahim Raisi, without naming the Ayatollah. It may be too early to predict the potential prospect of Pezeshkian’s Middle East policy or future efforts to renew Iran-West diplomacy with a neighbouring Taliban, but we witness some excitement within the Rahbari Shura, with members enthusiastically watching this political transition.Afghan migration post-Taliban ruleAs the third year of Taliban rule comes to a close, Afghans continue to apply—in large numbers—for migration to Iran, a pattern which appears to have grown since 2021. According to a source close to Khalil Haqqani (the acting Minister of Refugees), citizens (by hundreds) continue to stand in line outside the Ministry of Refugee and Repatriation in Kabul, seeking permission to leave the country.With the Islamic Republic of Iran topping the list of countries hosting Afghan refugees since the Taliban rule, Iran’s Permanent Representative to the United Nations, Ambassador Amir Saeed Iravani, during a Security Council session on June 21, reflected the reality. He stated that Iran has hosted over 6 million Afghan refugees till date. In what appeared to be a call for global support on the fate of Afghan Refugees, he argued that the Afghan refugees cost over $10 billion annually for sanctioned-struck Iran. With economic challenges and sanctions drastically sinking Iran’s economy, this amount may be phenomenal, with thousands of Afghan refugees waiting to flee.Tehran’s approach to Afghan refugeesThe fate of Afghan refugees in Iran and Tehran’s approach to resolving the refugee crisis may appear to be pertinent as questions, but they receive occasional responses from Tehran. The future of millions of Afghans living in despicable conditions throughout Iran raises questions on the sheer absence of housing, medical care, education, reunification of families (living within various camps), citizenship, access to bank accounts, or right to work, among other basic facilities, in the background of sheer ambiguous occasional responses from the Tehranian political class. To the Iranian public, the presence of Afghan migrants living in Tehran is a significant cause of concern, as expressed roughly by every scholar we interviewed. Unlike nations with dedicated migration frameworks/programmes/initiatives formulated by state humanitarian entities, Iran lacks a migration policy. This reflects local Iranians’ sentiment towards Afghan migrants, forcing Tehran to maintain some distance from the issue, creating a policy vacuum. Devoid of social interaction/societal integration, the Afghan migrants continue to be viewed with great suspicion, forcing local authorities to deny them even basic amenities and access to decent living.A hope from Pezeshkian?In many economies, migrant/refugee policies have always found their way through the electoral process. They did so, even in Iran’s conservative political system, with presidential candidates arguing on the issue of migrants. During the presidential race, Mohammad Ghalibaf and Pezeshkian emphasised the need to seriously address the Afghan refugee issue, at least in their campaign, garnering greater interaction/engagement over the problem. However, it remains ignored and occasionally answered by Tehran when asked by South Asian/Western scholars.Reflecting on Pezeshkian’s presidential campaign, we decided to predict that President-elect Pezeshkian's refugee policy—which remains unclear due to the Ayatollah’s constant guidance (according to one scholar)—may vary from closing the eastern borders with Afghanistan and Pakistan to mass deportation of refugees to a dedicated refugee agreement with the Taliban government or creating a dedicated Afghan refugee policy without alienating the Taliban. Those close to Pezeshkian reflected some positive outcomes to the Afghan refugee issue since “the President-elect aims to formulate a multi-dimensional approach to counter illegal foreign nationals”, according to a source who advises him on migrant issues.According to a Tehran-based scholar, Pezeshkian may call for a complete border closure, taking a harsher stand on migration in the first few weeks of his presidency. Although the President-elect discussed the challenges to migration and the influx of refugees (in Europe) with European leaders, it is highly likely for him to request that EU leaders accept some refugees if the Israeli hostage negotiations between the US and Hamas conclude successfully. It would not be incorrect to credit Pezeshkian on his positive reflection towards Afghan refugees, which, according to him, would play a positive/progressive role in Iran’s development, terming their contribution as constructive to the country’s growth.With the elections over and Pezeshkian yet to take office, the issue of Afghan refugees (which took precedence during his election campaign) may take a back seat, at least until August.A dedicated Afghan refugee policy?Without a doubt, the President-elect aims to govern refugees, and he understands the challenges of shutting down the border. Unlike his counterpart, he has drawn lessons from Trump’s Mexico Wall or the stricter stance of right-wing policymakers in Europe. It remains unclear whether his government would formulate a dedicated refugee policy (even one dedicated to Afghan refugees), carrying the risk of alienating either his voters, regime loyalists, Ayatollah himself or the Taliban.Pezeshkian’s first few months of the presidency will focus on the Gaza War, sanctioned hit economy, increasing unemployment and depleting workforce, not on the Afghan refugee crisis. Nonetheless, he could initiate policies and programmes to integrate Afghan refugees into a constructive role in Iran. The argument of a refugee policy/migrant reform dedicated to Afghan refugees appears far-fetched, but the President-elect may allow them to contribute to Iran’s economic development and infrastructural growth and also guarantee better housing, healthcare and access to better living.That said, decisions about the fate of Afghan refugees are made at levels higher than the legislative branch (executive under the guidance of the Supreme Leader), which the President-elect Pezeshkian cannot substantially change even as a policy. Though he may bring minor alterations in such a scenario, a fundamental change is but ideal. \nThe 2015 Constitution marked a significant milestone in Nepal’s political history. Its formal implementation began with the election of the three levels of government—federal, provincial and local—in 2017. As Nepal enters a new phase of its political evolution, it is an opportune moment to consider necessary amendments to the constitution to strengthen federalism and democracy. The Post also published an editorial titled 'Easy does it' this Monday, highlighting the complexities involved in this process. The Nepali Congress and the Communist Party of Nepal (UML), the two major political parties, claim to have agreed to amend the constitution. If so, this is a positive step toward addressing critical governance issues. However, alliances and agreements between these major parties are precarious and prone to change, threatening political stability. There are talks of forming a national consensus government and amending the constitution, but the possibility and impact of such an endeavour remain questionable.Nine years after its promulgation, the constitution’s shortcomings and inconsistencies have become evident. A severe review of the constitution's implementation is necessary, and reforms and amendments must address these issues. The constitution should be seen as a dynamic and living document, not merely a source of problems. This approach emphasises continuous improvement to reflect the evolving political and social environment.A good constitution alone does not ensure good governance; it requires competent, sincere and committed leaders. The constitution issued by the Constituent Assembly is certainly an improvement over previous versions, but its implementation has been slow. Provincial and local governments have struggled to exercise the rights granted by the constitution. For instance, the constitution assigns provinces the exclusive right to exercise police powers, but this has not been allowed in practice.Frequent changes in power have caused dissatisfaction among citizens. While the United States has maintained the same federal constitution and governance system for over two centuries, Switzerland has had the same federal system for 176 years, Canada for 157 years, and India for 74 years. These countries have undergone repeated constitutional reforms to ensure stability. In contrast, Nepal has seen numerous changes in its governance system and constitution.Federalism is the cornerstone of Nepal's constitution. The issue lies not in the constitution itself but in its implementation by the rulers. Instead of addressing constitutional loopholes, leaders have exacerbated them. Reforms in the electoral system are essential to achieving stability and a better federal governance system. Nepal’s mixed electoral system has led to coalition governments. While some people lament that small parties play disproportional roles in the coalition culture, a coalition of diverse parties can also bring more comprehensive ideas and solutions for the country’s development. However, individual interests have often taken precedence over national interests, leading to a lack of collective accountability. Therefore, reform of the electoral system is inevitable.A significant debate revolves around whether to reduce the seats allocated for proportional representation in the House of Representatives. The proportional representation system was designed to ensure fair representation for women, Dalits and marginalised communities. Removing this system altogether, or even reducing its weightage, without addressing the underlying issues of representation, would be inappropriate and counterproductive. The fault lies not in the electoral system but in the political leadership that constantly changes alliances.Some politicians and analysts have proposed direct election of the Prime Minister and Chief Minister, which could lead to more stable governments. This change would require making parliamentary elections entirely proportional, ensuring that MPs focus on law-making and government oversight. They also propose reforming the structure of the provinces, as the current federal system does not appear to function effectively. Reducing the number of Members of Parliament (MPs) is necessary. The House of Representatives (HoR) currently has 275 seats, and the Provincial Assemblies together have 550 seats. The large size of the HoR and the provincial assemblies has resulted in huge expenses. The first-past-the-post (FPTP) voting system should ensure that everyone is directly elected, and the number of MPs should be adjusted accordingly. Reducing the number of MPs elected through the proportional electoral system—currently 110 in the HoR and 220 in the provincial assemblies—will also address the high costs associated with federalism. However, in the FPTP system, those elected via the proportional electoral system, such as women, Dalits and other marginalised communities, should be addressed with reserved constituencies. In such cases, elections should be held exclusively within these groups.The proportional electoral system is not inherently flawed. However, it has often benefited those with political connections or financial influence. To address this, proportional candidates should be elected based on joint votes from political parties and candidates, ensuring the people approve them. Amendments should include fixing the tenure of the Prime Minister, similar to the President and local level heads, who have two tenures. The PM should not serve more than two terms. Limiting MPs from becoming ministers can also reduce political corruption. Reducing the number of ministers is crucial; the current provision for up to 25 ministers is excessive. With the provincial and local levels taking more responsibilities, the number of ministries at the federal level should be reduced by half.Nepal's federal system must also streamline the number of departments and ministries. Many existing departments play insignificant roles and should be abolished or transferred to provinces. Stability at the provincial level is another critical issue. Frequent changes of Chief Ministers have led to public discontent. Direct elections for Chief Ministers can enhance accountability and stability. The constitution should be amended to allow the Vice President to become the Chairperson of the National Assembly. This will reduce additional expenses and enhance the role and effectiveness of the National Assembly.Amending the constitution requires a two-thirds majority in both houses of Parliament, which the Congress and the UML alone cannot achieve. Forming a national consensus government is necessary to garner the required support. However, significant contradictions among the parties on constitutional issues make it challenging to reach a consensus. These contradictions need to be addressed through dialogue and compromise to move forward effectively.The constitution outlines formal roles and duties and expects certain behaviour from political and institutional actors. Political parties, leadership, parliament, judiciary and constitutional bodies must establish actions aligned with the constitution's essence. Without this alignment, politics cannot gain people’s trust, and the Constitution becomes merely a tool for gaining power.Judicial reforms are also crucial for constitutional stability. The constitution must be amended to address these issues comprehensively. Disillusionment and mistrust towards political leadership and politics in general are prevalent. This sentiment stems from the opportunism of political leaders rather than the constitution and the system. We need a new generation of leaders who can feel the changing aspirations of society and maintain relevance in politics. Leadership should focus on long-term national interests rather than short-term personal gains.Nepal stands at a crossroads where constitutional amendments can pave the way for a more stable and prosperous future. The collaboration between major political parties and the lessons from international experiences underscore the importance of these reforms. By addressing the current challenges and ensuring proportional inclusive representation, Nepal can strengthen its federalism and democracy, fulfilling the aspirations of its people.Finally, amending the constitution alone will not solve the problems unless it is accompanied by a change in political culture and leaders’ attitudes and actions. Political stability and effectiveness depend on the commitment of political actors to uphold the principles of the constitution and work towards the common good. This holistic approach is essential for ensuring the constitution remains a robust and guiding document for the nation’s future. \nAs much as we love the monsoon for its greenery and promise of a bountiful harvest, we dread floods, landslides and diseases. As in years past, disasters have wreaked havoc in several parts of Nepal this year too, leading to at least 70 deaths since June. Adding to the woes are vector- and water-borne diseases, such as viral fever, diarrhoea, dysentery, food poisoning, typhoid, dengue and kala-azar, turning the season into a time of epidemics. The Epidemiology and Disease Control Division has already warned doctors and the public of possible uptick in incidents of these diseases.In 2022, as a result of contaminated water, Kathmandu Valley saw an outbreak of cholera, with 77 positive cases reported. The same year, diarrheal diseases affected hundreds of people for many months. Just last month, a patient tested positive for the Vibrio cholerae 01 Ogawa serotype at the Sukraraj Tropical and Infectious Disease Hospital, of which the authorities were reportedly unaware, as per a Post report. This is not a good sign, as many cases usually go unreported because people don’t visit hospitals unless there’s an emergency, and a lack of investigation from the government means no awareness about the possible spread of cholera. Such negligence about a deadly disease will only fuel its spread.Moreover, the dengue outbreak in the country has gone out of hand over the years. According to official records, the virus has circulated to 73 districts, infecting almost 1,500 people since January. What is concerning is that these numbers could go up, as we aren’t even halfway through this monsoon, and the dengue virus lasts until post-monsoon. Additionally, climate change and rising temperatures have pushed the disease even into the winter season. Recently, health experts have also been worried about the possible instances of the Zika virus (similar to dengue) in Nepal, as cases are being detected in the southern neighbour India. The outbreaks of these diseases and their prolonged presence can easily drain the healthcare facilities of an under-resourced country like ours. In the monsoon crisis, the poor and vulnerable suffer the most, as their condition is compounded by contaminated water, floods, landslides, and other monsoon-related disasters. This not only affects their treatment-seeking behaviour but also their ability to adopt preventive measures, which could in turn lead to community-level transmission of diseases.The Epidemic and Outbreak Surveillance of the Ministry of Health is tasked with collecting data on diseases, informing the general public, and encouraging policymakers to take necessary actions against outbreaks and make people aware of them. Moreover, it also regularly monitors drinking water quality and does surveillance of water-borne diseases. In recent months, it has found harmful substances like faecal coliform in bottled water and even tap water in some places in the Kathmandu Valley. These findings suggest the surveillance and monitoring mechanism in the country has to be strengthened, and local units around the country should be made responsible for keeping their water resources safe throughout the year, especially during the monsoon, to prevent possible outbreaks of water-borne diseases. In the case of vector-borne dengue, Zika and chikungunya viruses, a year-round door-to-door search and destruction of mosquito breeding areas is a must.Nepal has been dealing with monsoon maladies for decades. Our healthcare system should proactively allocate human, infrastructural and budgetary resources to combat these monsoon epidemics and prevent unnecessary loss of life and a whole lot of suffering.  \nThe monsoon has been causing havoc right across Nepal in the past couple of days. At least 70 people have been killed in floods, landslides and other monsoon-related disasters since June 10, according to the Nepal Police. Five others were missing and 86 people were injured in water-induced disasters over a month. There must have been many other incidents not included in official records. The monsoon entered Nepal from its eastern part in the second week of June. Heavy rainfalls that caused huge damage in Bagmati, Gandaki and Lumbini provinces until Sunday, wreaked havoc in far-western Nepal on Monday.As a country with over 83 percent of its land covered by hills and mountains, Nepal is always at the risk of landslides and floods mainly in the monsoon period. Similarly, people in the southern belt are tormented by inundation. Monsoon-related disasters are a yearly occurrence. The Monsoon Preparedness and Response Plan 2024 estimated that over 412,000 households may be affected and of them over 83,000 are likely to be badly hit by monsoon-related disasters this season. In a decade between April 2014 to April 2024, there were 1,602 recorded floods and 2,840 landslides. At least 3,052 people were killed, 791 went missing and 4,176 were injured in the period, according to the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Authority. Similarly, 16,054 buildings and other structures were damaged. This shows the magnitude of the losses caused by monsoon-related disasters in the country.As heavy rains have battered almost all parts of the country, a large number of people have been struggling to deal with the disasters. Besides deaths, missing and injuries, thousands have been displaced and taking shelter in nearby places. In such times, saving lives by rescuing people trapped in difficult situations should be the government’s first priority. Logically, what follows is shifting people from disaster-prone areas to safer places, swiftly distributing reliefs and working on a plan to rehabilitate the displaced. Though our three security agencies often do a commendable job of saving people’s lives, they are still not well-equipped. Just months ago, some of them died while trying to contain wildfires. Rescuers should be equipped with better gears and other logistics before they set out on rescue missions. Moreover, relief distribution and rehabilitation works often court controversy either because of substandard quality of the goods distributed, or the irregularities while carrying out the task.When it comes to rehabilitating flood victims, our state agencies have utterly failed. Thousands of people have been languishing in either nearby forest areas, on riverbanks or other unsafe places for years where they had supposedly been shifted for a few months. For instance, floods in Koshi in August 2008 displaced 7,563 families from the present-day Shreepur, Haripur, and West Kushaha, located across different wards of Koshi Rural Municipality. But they are still living in makeshift huts and mud houses as the government has failed to properly rehabilitate them in the past 16 years. The Koshi Flood Victims Struggle Committee is fighting for their basic rights. A state that cannot ensure the basic safety of its citizens, we are afraid, has gotten its priorities badly wrong.    \nThe text of the midnight deal last Monday whereby the Nepali Congress and the CPN-UML agreed to stitch together a new coalition remains hidden, giving rise to much speculation. Yet while talking about the deal, the leaders of the two parties have pointed to the necessity of a ‘national consensus’ government in order to address the country’s pressing problems. This, they say, entails amending the nine-year-old national constitution. Even if the country’s two largest parties come together, they will fall short of a two-thirds majority needed to amend the constitution in the federal lower House. Had they the numbers in the lower chamber, they would have fallen short in the upper House. To amend the constitution, the ruling parties ought to have two-thirds majority in both. This is why many analysts reckon the constitution amendment is no more than an excuse to justify the toppling of the Pushpa Kamal Dahal government. That is unfortunate. The biggest architects of the national charter cannot be so cavalier when it comes to its amendment.The other suspicion is that in pushing for constitution amendment, the two big parties want to significantly reduce the number of proportional representation seats in the two Houses. The reasoning is that the PR seats have allowed many smaller political outfits to enter parliament and to bargain for power with the big parties, thus contributing to political instability. The Congress and the UML also seemingly want to capitalise on the perception that the PR seats are mostly reserved for those close to powerful party chairs rather than for members of the marginalised and under-represented communities, as was envisioned in the constitution. Whatever the case, they should tread carefully. Despite all its flaws, the PR system has significantly increased the political representation of marginalised communities and groups and it would be dangerous to fiddle with it without their buy-in. There is also no guarantee a fully FPTP system will ensure stability. Even before the new constitution came into effect in 2015, not a single government, each one of them formed through direct elections, came close to serving out its full term. This again points to the need for broad consultations—and not a little introspection on the part of our top leaders. A living document that is the constitution can and should be amended on a timely basis, or it becomes irrelevant. But hastily tweaking it could invite more problems than it would solve. It is interesting that many of the high-ranking Congress and UML leaders were unaware of the Monday deal even an hour before it was signed. It is thus hard to believe that the points of agreement were much discussed even inside the two parties, much less in the broader society. For far too long, the leaders of the big parties have treated the apparatus of government pretty much as their personal property. The biggest reason the new federal republican system has not functioned as intended is their sense of entitlement, lack of accountability, and paucity of faith in the system they have themselves championed in public. Unless there is a change in this mindset, no system of governance or election will yield the desired results.  \nThe Nepali Congress and the CPN-UML last week reached an agreement to form a coalition government under the leadership of UML chair KP Sharma Oli. As a part of the package, they also aim to make certain changes to the constitution. The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal asked Pradeep Gyawali, deputy general secretary of UML, the reasons behind the coming together of the two largest parties, how they plan to run the government and to review and amend the constitution.Many are seeing the Congress-UML alliance as something unusual. What factors brought the two largest parties together even as there is no crisis-like situation or a special task such as constitution writing?Definitely, in normal parliamentary practice, the two largest parties don’t forge an alliance to run a government. The party that gets the biggest mandate leads the government, and the other big party remains in the opposition to make the ruling force accountable. In Nepal, the country’s two major forces, the Congress and the UML, have also joined hands in certain junctures for certain purposes. They worked together to make the constitution in 1990, to conduct general elections in 1999, to complete transition after the 2006 people’s movement and to bring out the constitution in 2015. We felt a need for a similar collaboration this time around. After the November 2022 elections, we saw three alliances in our parliament. At first, Maoist Centre chair Pushpa Kamal Dahal became prime minister with our support, but he failed to abide by the agreement sincerely. He changed the coalition within a month. The subsequent alliance between the Congress and the Maoist Centre lasted for a year. He again sought the UML’s support. Within four months of the March 4 deal with the UML, he started yet another gameplan to join hands with the Congress under the pretext of forming a national consensus government. It was quite unusual for the prime minister himself to instigate instability in the government. He publicly boasted that he had a ‘magical number’ [32 seats in the House of Representatives]. He thought that he could employ the tactic of ‘use and throw’ with the two largest parties and rule the country for the full term. He was completely indifferent to people’s plight, the country’s pressing issues and service delivery. This was the height of irresponsibility. So, the UML and Congress leaders concluded that the time had come to intervene to ensure political stability and service delivery and make sure public frustration doesn’t get out of hand. Did external factors play a role? Recent statements by UML leaders suggest that the party has taken it seriously. When national forces are weak, the neighbouring countries and international forces become more cautious, even more so given Nepal’s geo-political situation. Some of their concerns are valid. They fear political instability in Nepal may have an adverse impact on their genuine issues. We have to take this naturally. Second, it is no secret that we have a long legacy of facing external interference. Sometimes such interventions are carried out covertly and sometimes overtly. Therefore, national forces should be strong. Some political parties and leaders have a tendency of seeking external forces’ support to fulfil their vested interests. In return, they serve the external forces’ undue interests. Formation of a government is a purely domestic affair, but in our case sometimes it also becomes an issue of geopolitical interest. It is said that the UML was spooked when it learned that Prime Minister Dahal had reportedly approached the Congress for a new alliance. This reportedly happened after Dahal returned from New Delhi following Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s swearing-in.We were taken by surprise when the Congress leaders told us that the prime minister had reached out to them with a proposal to form a national consensus government. We were informed about the development from the leaders of the main opposition party. When we reached the March 4 deal with the prime minister, we thought he came to us with a commitment to course correction. Based on that, we supported him almost unconditionally. We didn’t bargain while sharing ministerial portfolios and didn’t talk about the prime minister’s term. We had even thought of allowing Dahal to run the government for the full term if the government functioned well and people were satisfied. We hadn’t even imagined that we would have to think about changing the coalition within four months.We definitely had certain grievances such as a lack of consultation with our party and our lawmakers while preparing the government’s policies and programmes and while allocating budget. Our party chair brought up this issue with the prime minister. But our concerns weren’t addressed. They had already started to ignore us. There were several issues with the prime minister, but we were committed to the partnership. But they had already gone too far. Fortunately, the Congress leaders didn’t accept the offer and instead raised critical questions about the rationale behind the proposal. Basically, the Congress didn’t trust Prachanda ji [Dahal] and came to us. It concluded that Dahal didn’t come with the intent of solving the country’s problems but to manoeuvre between the Congress and the UML.Besides jointly running the government, constitution amendment is another major aspect of the latest Congress-UML deal. What are the provisions the parties want to change?There are four major objectives of this agreement. Safeguarding national interest; strengthening economy; improving governance and service delivery; and ensuring political stability. A debate has started that some constitutional provisions are not helping maintain political stability. What we have said is that it’s been almost a decade since the promulgation of this constitution. Some of its provisions are yet to be implemented. On the other hand, provincial governments complain that they have not been able to work in a full-fledged way because the federal government has still not made some laws they need. So, first, we will undertake a comprehensive review on the progress in the course of implementing the constitution and the challenges we faced in the past decade, among other things. While doing so, we will find out if there are provisions that have posed challenges in maintaining political stability and running a stable government and suggest amendments accordingly.So, it’s not only about the amendment but also about review, assessment and recommendation for amendment, if there is a need. Even if the amendment process begins, it will be limited to ensuring political stability and won’t touch other aspects of the statute. There is no need to over-react. For instance, some Maoist leaders are trying to make it a political issue by describing it as a regressive move. That is wrong.So as per the two-party deal, the statute will be reviewed but not necessarily amended?Yes, whether to go for amendments will depend on the findings of the review. No constitution in the world is perfect. Its success largely depends on the practitioners. So, first we have to differentiate between the role of the constitution and the practitioners. It is true that our society is divided over certain provisions of our constitution. All these issues will be considered, but the fundamental features of the constitution such as democracy, inclusion and federalism won’t be altered. Our priority would be to only remove hindrances in making the system more functional, people-oriented and productive.Of late, people are debating the electoral system, provincial structure and secularism. Will these issues also be dealt with?Federalism is a new system for us. In fact, it is still an in-the-making process in Nepal. We have to note some timelines while analysing the performance of provinces. After the provincial and federal elections in 2017, the first provincial governments were formed in 2018, and they worked for around three years in a stable way. With small cabinets, they worked genuinely to strengthen the provincial system. At the time, most provincial cabinets had around six to seven ministers. They weren’t severely criticised at the time. The wrong trends in the provinces started with the division of the then Nepal Communist Party and the fall of the NCP-led governments at the centre as well as provinces. We saw the trend of horse-trading in provinces. Small parties made unjustified bargaining for ministerial portfolios, chief ministers started splitting ministries and increasing the number of ministers in their cabinets. Also, the November 2022 polls again gave a fragmented verdict, further augmenting the instability and anomalies at the provincial level. So, the problem is the way we are handling things more than the provincial structures. The time isn’t ripe to seek an alternative to the provinces. As far as the electoral model is concerned, we included proportional electoral (PR) system after long debates and discussions. Based on three general elections held after 1990, a conclusion was drawn that the first-past-the-post (FPTP) model couldn’t properly represent the historically under-represented sections. The premise is still valid. Based on the achievements, we may exclude certain communities from the list. But that time hasn’t come. Two questions raised over the use of PR are valid. Is the system really doing justice to the strata and class of the society for which it was introduced? This is the question not about the PR system but the leaders who use it. Similarly, some questions: Is proportional representation required in executive as well because representation is basically vital for policy making? The forms and modalities of the PR system might be discussed, but no one has even thought of removing the inclusive system.Similar is the case with secularism. The spirit is to make the state patron of all religions in the country. However, some sections of society have often tried to misuse and misinterpret the new constitutional provision. They try to interpret secularism as openly allowing rampant religious conversion, and some have made it an excuse to attack the age-old Sanatan faith. For instance, if the President or prime minister visits Lumbini, gurudwara or a shrine of any other faith on certain occasions, that is taken positively, but when they visit Pashupatinath Temple, a section of people raise questions. These activities have made some people think that these attacks on our Sanatan faith are taking place because of the secular system. There is no problem in the constitutional provision because the statute added an explanatory note that states, “‘secular’ means religious, cultural freedoms, including protection of religion and culture handed down from time immemorial.” But some extremist activities have given wrong impressions.Some experts believe the problem of fragmented mandate can be addressed by increasing the threshold required for a political party to be eligible to get PR seats, which can be done by amending laws. Will the Congress-UML alliance opt for this?Yes, this is one feasible option. I am in favour of this. As per the existing provision, a political party can secure seats under the PR category by securing 3 percent votes in the federal parliament and 1.5 percent votes in provincial assemblies. If a political organisation doesn’t even represent 5 or 7 or 10 percent of the population, what can they contribute to the country? You do politics to represent a sizable population and get a public mandate. Otherwise, the presence of such groups would only promote unreasonable bargaining and instigate instability in governments. This can be one of the agenda of the discussion between the two parties.This time, leaders have made it transparent that chiefs of the two parties will lead the government on a rotational basis. But why have other details of the agreement not been made public?There hasn’t been topic-wise discussions on specific provisions. The broader understanding is to review and assess the implementation aspect of the constitution and move ahead based on the findings of the assessment. We have also made it clear that such an act will be guided only by the objective of ensuring political stability and we will not go beyond that. Who will undertake this type of constitution review?We haven’t worked on it in detail. We haven’t reached any understanding. Naturally, inputs will be taken from the constitution makers, experts on constitutional law and politicians involved in this field. But no decision has been made on its nitty-gritty.The Rastriya Prajatantra Party that wants to revive the Hindu kingdom was the first party to welcome the Congress-UML deal while the Maoist Centre has accused Congress and UML of making a regressive move. So don’t you think this affair is tricky?I don’t think the political parties will touch the issues that the RPP talks about, such as reinstatement of Hindu kingdom and dissolution of federalism. No one is thinking about that. Also, the questions raised by the Maoist leaders have no meaning. They are only trying to make a political agenda.It also seems that the Congress and the UML floated this idea of reviewing the constitution to make a case for the two largest parties to form the government.That’s not true. This question undermines the spirit of this agreement. If this system fails, people will raise questions mainly to the leaders of the Congress and the UML, not Prachanda. It’s not only about running the government. We were already in the government and it isn’t a big deal for the Congress to return to power. If democracy fails, the democratic forces will lose the most. So we are genuinely working on this. The Congress and the UML are historical rival forces in Nepali politics. How can the two work together in government?It is true that the Congress and the UML are the two major competitors of this country. But we have some converging factors. First, we both believe in a broader democratic framework. Sometimes, the Congress may give more emphasis on liberal values while we may push for more socialism-oriented programmes. But the common ground is democratic values. We also have the experience of successfully carrying out certain tasks jointly. We may have some friction but we also have experience of managing bitter intra-party fighting as well as inter-party rivalry.How will the ministerial portfolios be shared in the new coalition?We haven’t reached any agreement in detail. As we aim to make this a ‘national consensus government’ we are in favour of accommodating other parties. So it will depend on the number of parties that join the Cabinet. Our only concern is that ministerial allocations should be done in a way that doesn’t weaken the prime minister in order to ensure that the head of the government can deliver.How can a government without the Maoist Centre and some other parties be called a consensus government?We have to wait for that. Leaders of political parties that fiercely criticise the government also join the Cabinet under one or other pretext. Some political parties seemingly cannot exist without being in the government.  \nOver half of students in Nepal failed the Secondary Education Examinations due to the introduction of a non-graded category and systemic issues including low-quality teachers and outdated teaching methods, despite the letter grading system being designed to enhance education standards.\nNepal's government recalled ambassadors ahead of PM Dahal's India visit; highlights recent diplomatic developments, including the progress in implementing agreements with China and the BRI projects.\nThe National ID Card has become mandatory in 28 districts for accessing government and public institution services, with critics arguing against its enforcement before widespread distribution, despite ongoing efforts to replace multiple cards and enhance security.\nDespite being adopted eight years ago, Nepal's federal system faces challenges due to centralized decision-making, lack of provincial autonomy, and political interference, leading to criticism and demands for amendments or overhauling.\nHeavy to very heavy rainfall is expected in Koshi, Madhesh, Bagmai, Gandaki and Lumbini provinces, with light to moderate rain and thunderstorms nationwide.\nHeavy rainfall with thunder and lightning is expected across multiple provinces in Nepal, with the possibility of very heavy rainfall in some areas, accompanied by generally cloudy conditions and a temperature range of 16.0-36.4 degrees Celsius.\nWednesday's forecast: partly to cloudy with light to moderate rain, thunder, and lightning in Koshi, Madhesh, Gandaki, Lumbini, and Bagmati provinces; heavy rainfall in parts of Koshi, Madhesh, and Gandaki; Thursday's forecast: generally cloudy with light to moderate rainfall and heavy rainfall in Koshi, Madhesh, Gandaki, and Lumbini.\nRain and thunderstorms forecast for multiple provinces in Nepal, with heavy rainfall warnings for Koshi, Madhesh, and Gandaki.\n\nBe elaborative as possible.

Though still a developing nation, Nepal was a land of profound beauty and deep-rooted cultural heritage. The residents of Nepal faced many challenges, but beneath these hardships lay a resilient spirit and an unyielding hope for the future.\n\nThis enchanting land, where Mount Everest reaches towards the skies and the air carries a mix of incense and cool mountain breezes, was more than a geographical marvel. It was a mosaic of cultures, languages, and traditions, a testament to human endeavor against all odds. Nepal's history, from the unification under King Prithvi Narayan Shah to its transformation into a federal democratic republic, told a story of aspiration and endurance.\n\nIn recent years, the people of Nepal, with their indomitable will, had taken strides towards rebuilding and reimagining their country. They turned their struggles into stepping stones, each challenge a chapter in their ongoing saga. The shift from a monarchy to a republic had not only changed governance but had woven a new tapestry of democratic values and collective decision-making.\n\nEconomically, while agriculture continued to sustain a large part of its population, Nepal had begun to harness the potential of its picturesque landscapes, developing sustainable tourism that promised to preserve their natural heritage while boosting local economies. Communities living in the shadows of the Himalayas had become stewards of the earth, protecting the biodiversity that made their country unique.\n\nEach day brought new stories. Whether it was a festival in Kathmandu, a technological advance in Pokhara, or a conservation effort in Chitwan, these events were threads in the vibrant quilt of Nepali life. These stories, updated daily, reflected the pulse of progress and the spirit of hope that characterized this resilient nation.\n\nAnd so, as Nepal moved forward, each moment was not just a passage of time but a promise of potential, a narrative of a nation perennially climbing towards tomorrow, guided by the legacy of its past and the dreams of its future.\n\nNews events:\nCPN-UML Chairman KP Sharma Oli has staked his claim to the post of new prime minister after President Ramchandra Paudel invited a member of the House of Representatives who is able to command a majority with the support of two or more parties to do so.Following the failure of Pushpa Kamal Dahal, the outgoing prime minister, to secure a majority in Friday’s floor test, the President invited political parties to form a new government under Article 76 (2) of the Constitution of Nepal on Friday evening. Article 76 (2) says the President appoints as prime minister a member of the House of Representatives who can secure a majority with support from two or more parties. UML chief Oli presented signatures of 165 lawmakers on Friday night, shortly after the President issued the invitation giving parties until 5 pm on Sunday. Oli and Nepali Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba have jointly signed an application asking the President to appoint Oli as the new prime minister citing his majority support in the House of Representatives. “The President’s Office has received signatures from the two major parties commanding the majority in the House,” said Kiran Pokhrel, press adviser to the Paudel. “The President will study the documents submitted by the parties.” Nepali Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba, Oli and a few other leaders had visited the President’s Office to present their letter. During the conversation with Deuba and Oli, the President said he would appoint Oli the new prime minister as soon as the deadline expires and agreed to administer oath of office and secrecy immediately after 5:00 pm, Sunday. “But with the country grappling with floods and landslides and unprecedented human casualties, there is an urgency,” according to a UML leader. “So the appointment will be made on Sunday morning and the swearing-in could take place on the same afternoon.” “We submitted the signatures of Congress and UML lawmakers to the President’s Office,” Ramesh Lekhak, chief whip of the Nepali Congress, said. “It is now up to the President to decide when to appoint the new prime minister.”“With the support of the Nepali Congress, which has 88 lawmakers in the lower house, we submitted signatures of 165 lawmakers,” he added. The UML, the second largest party in the House of Representatives, has 77 lawmakers excluding the Speaker and suspended lawmaker Top Bahadur Rayamajhi, who is in jail. Deuba and Oli were accompanied by Congress chief whip Lekhak, UML chief whip Mahesh Bartuala, and other Congress and UML lawmakers when they submitted the signatures of lawmakers to the President's Office.To stake a claim to form a new government, a minimum of 138 signatures is required in the 275-seat House of Representatives. Until a new government is installed, the President has asked the outgoing prime minister, Pushpa Kamal Dahal, to serve as caretaker. Dahal lost a vote of confidence on Friday. Issuing a statement on Friday evening, the President’s Office said, “After Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal failed to secure a vote of confidence under Article 100 (3), as informed by the Speaker of the House of Representatives, a member of Parliament commanding majority support from two or more political parties is invited to submit a claim for the post of prime minister by Sunday 5:00 pm, as per Article 76 (2).”Although fringe parties, including the Janata Samajbadi Party (JSP), the JSP-Nepal, the Loktantrik Samajbadi Party, the Janamat Party and the Nagarik Unmukti Party have pledged support to the Congress-UML coalition, Oli presented his claim to the President only with the backing of the UML and the Congress. As per the July 1 deal between Congress chief Sher Bahadur Deuba and UML chair Oli, the two parties will lead the government on a rotational basis until next general elections scheduled for 2027. Besides a power-sharing deal, the two parties, in a seven-point agreement that has yet to be made public, have also agreed on several issues including amending the constitution.More political parties have extended support to the new power-sharing deal between the Congress and UML. The two parties have also started power-sharing negotiations including on division of ministerial portfolios.On Friday, soon after Dahal failed the trust vote, President Paudel consulted constitutional and legal experts on new government formation. According to the President’s Office, those consulted were Purnaman Shakya, Bipin Adhikari, Gopal Krishna Ghimire, Harihar Dahal, Sher Bahadur KC, Tikaram Bhattarai, Chandra Kant Gyawali and Sitaram KC.All constitutional experts besides Gyawali advised the President to initiate government formation as per Article 76 (2), according to a participant.Gyawali had advised the President to invoke Article 76 (3).According to Ghimire, they advised the President to call for government formation as per Article 76 (2) citing political and constitutional provisions, as well as past court verdicts. They told the President that any party commanding majority support should be given a chance.After consulting the experts, Paudel decided to call for government formation as per Article 76 (2), an aide to the President said.Prime Minister Dahal lost his position on Friday, over 18 months after his appointment.Dahal could not secure the 138 votes required to endorse the trust motion as only 63 lawmakers voted in his favour. A total of 194 lawmakers voted against him, while one member voted to stay neutral. A total of 258 lawmakers were present in Friday’s meeting of the lower House.Soon after failing to secure the confidence of the House, Prime Minister Dahal met with President Paudel to inform him of the outcome.On Friday, Dahal moved from his official residence in Baluwatar to his private residence in Khumaltar.  \nAt least 54 people are missing after two passenger buses were swept away by a mudslide into the rain-swollen Trishuli River near Simaltal along the Narayanghat-Muglin road section in the wee hours on Friday.According to Indradev Yadav, chief district officer of Chitwan, a Kathmandu-bound Angel Deluxe Bus and a Ganapati Deluxe Bus, en route to Gaur of Rautahat district from Kathmandu, were pushed into the river by the mudslide at around 3:30 am.Based on preliminary inquiry, Police said 24 people were on board the Angel Deluxe Bus travelling to Kathmandu. They included 14 Nepalis, seven Indians, and three members of the bus crew. By Friday evening details of 17 persons were established. Likewise, 30 passengers were said to be travelling on the Ganapati Deluxe Bus, but identities of only 17 of them were established by the evening, according to Deputy Superintendent of Police Bhesh Raj Rijal. Three of the passengers on the Gaur-bound bus survived. Earlier in the morning, officials had estimated that at least 60 people were on board the two buses and this figure was revised later.Nepal Police, Armed Police Force and Nepal Army personnel who were deployed to rescue the passengers worked tirelessly all day to locate the buses and survivors, but their efforts were hampered by the swelling river and continuous rainfall.Jugeshwar Raya Yadav from ward 9 of Garuda Municipality, Nandan Das from ward 1 of Gonahi Municipality, and Saroj Gupta, all from Rautahat district, managed to survive. Gupta was discharged after minor treatment at a government hospital in Bharatpur. Yadav and Das are undergoing treatment at Chitwan Medical College in Bharatpur. Jugeshwar was returning from Kathmandu after the treatment of his son and daughter. “I was in the bus along with my 10-year-old son, my daughter and two grandchildren,” Jugeshwar said. “Now I am here at the hospital, but all of them were trapped inside the bus.”According to him, the driver had stopped the bus at Simaltal for a while due to a landslide. “Later, the bus crew decided to push ahead thinking that the landslide had stopped,” he said. But the bus was swept into the river by a moving mass of mud. “I somehow got out of the bus, swam to the riverbank and climbed to the road. All others went down along with the bus,” he said. Nandan had gone to Kathmandu to initiate a process to go to Bahrain in search of work. He was returning home after submitting his passport to his agent in the Capital. “It was about an hour after we had eaten at a hotel. The bus overturned from the road. The strong water current threw me out of the bus window. I swam across the river,” he said. Rescue teams from the Nepal Army and Armed Police Force along with some divers, started a search operation at 8am. Twelve divers have been mobilised from the Disaster Management Training Institute of the APF at Kurintar. “A team of 70 trained in water-induced disasters have been deployed at the incident site. Of them 12 are divers,” Superintendent of Police Janak Puri of the institute said. The Nepal Army rescue team has 55 members. “Of them 20, including five divers, were assigned to search with boats,” Lieutenant Colonel Dinesh Lama said. A team of Nepal Police is also mobilised at the incident site. While the army and APF personnel are scouring the river, the Nepal Police team is busy with other arrangements outside the river.The teams halted their search operation after 7 pm, and plan to resume on Saturday morning. Meanwhile, rescuers have found some items including a child’s trousers and a curtain of a bus window. Based on these items, they believe they have pinpointed the location of the Angel Deluxe Bus. In a separate incident at Satrakilo along the same road section, the driver was killed after a falling boulder hit a bus. The victim, identified as Meghnath BK, died in the course of treatment at Chitwan Medical College. The bus was heading for Kathmandu from Butwal, according to Bhesh Raj Rijal, deputy superintendent of police. Likewise, landslides triggered by incessant rainfall buried 11 people to death in Kaski district.Of the victims, six members of a family and their neighbour died after being buried by the landslide in ward 19 of Pokhara Metropolitan City at around 10:15 pm on Thursday. The deceased have been identified as Kul Bahadur Pariyar, 47; his 43-year-old wife, Mana Kumari; his mother Laxima, 85; two daughters—Prabha, 20, and Prashna, 15; and son-in-law Asmit Pariyar.Their neighbour Radhika Pariyar also died while trying to rescue the victims, Deputy Superintendent of Police Basant Kumar Sharma said, quoting eyewitnesses.Three other children—aged 18, 11 and 9 years—were killed in Chainpur in ward 32 of Pokhara Metropolitan City.Likewise, the body of 80-year-old Maiti Kumari Gurung, who had gone missing in the disaster, was also found at Tallo Saple in ward 11 of Madi Rural Municipality in Kaski.All the bodies have been sent to the Pokhara Academy of Health Sciences for postmortem.“At least 15 people have died in Kaski, Myagdi, Chitwan, and Saptari districts in the past 24 hours,” said Dijan Bhattarai, information officer at the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Authority (NDRRMA) under the Ministry of Home Affairs. “The actual number of passengers who died in the two passenger buses is still being ascertained.”Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal expressed sadness over the incident and directed the authorities to conduct search and rescue operations.“I am deeply saddened by the news of nearly five dozen passengers missing after a landslide swept away buses in Simaltar of Narayanghat-Mugling road section and the loss caused by the disaster in different parts of the country,” Dahal wrote on X. “I direct all government agencies, including the home administration, to search and rescue the passengers.”Several other districts also witnessed landslides, flooding, and inundation due to the rainfall that continued since Friday last week.Debris from landslides at various locations obstructed vehicular movements, and flooding cut the road sections, leaving hundreds of passengers stranded.A Nepal Police bulletin issued on Friday afternoon said that a total of 103 people have died and 3,547 families displaced in rain-related incidents across the country since June 10.Meanwhile, the Meteorological Forecasting Division under the Department of Hydrology and Meteorology had also warned of extremely heavy rainfall in some places of the Koshi, Madhesh, Bagmati, Gandaki, and Lumbini provinces on Friday night.Met officials said that these five provinces along with Karnali Province would witness light to moderate rainfall, with a few places witnessing heavy rainfall on Saturday.“Incidents of extremely heavy rainfalls will go down Monday onwards, but rainfall will continue, as the monsoon trough is still close to the country,” said Gobinda Jha, a meteorologist at the division.The division said that Chitwan witnessed 133 mm of rainfall, where the two buses were swept into Trishuli River by the landslide. Bhairahawa witnessed 157.9 mm of rainfall, Pokhara 102.3 mm of rainfall and Udayapur 104 mm of rainfall.The monsoon season in Nepal generally begins on June 13 and ends on September 23. This year, the monsoon entered Nepal from the southwest on June 10, three days ahead of the usual onset date. Last year, it started on June 14, a day later than the normal onset day.The monsoon, which delivers around 80 percent of the country’s total annual rainfall, generally lasts for 105 days. But, in recent years, it has been taking more time to withdraw.The division has forecast above-normal rains and above-average maximum and minimum temperatures this monsoon, which could unleash extreme weather events such as flooding, inundation, and landslides.Nepal is one of the world’s most vulnerable countries to the climate crisis and has witnessed multiple extreme weather events over the past decade and a half.Evidence suggests that maximum temperatures in Nepal are rising faster, at 0.056 degrees Celsius a year, compared to the global average rise of 0.03 degrees Celsius a year.Experts say extreme weather events—excessive rainfall in a short period, continuous rains for several days after the monsoon, dry spells, droughts, below-average precipitation, and above-normal winter temperatures—have become more frequent in Nepal.The National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Authority estimates that 1.81 million people and 412,000 households will be affected by monsoon this year. Of them, 83,000 households will be directly impacted, and 18,000 families will require rescue due to monsoon-related disasters. \nNepal’s central bank has allowed Nepali payment system operators to deal with digital retail payments in any country. For example, a Nepali payment system operator (PSO) can now agree with any PSO in any country to launch the quick response (QR) code payment system for the citizens of both countries to make purchases. Nepal Rastra Bank issued a circular on June 27, allowing a merchant-to-person payment (M2P) system. PSOs can now make agreements with PSOs of any country and start the service. However, before signing a memorandum of understanding, the PSOs need the central bank’s approval.“The central bank has fully opened the retail payment system. Nepali PSOs and PSOs of any country can now jointly start the retail payment service through QR code,” said Gunakar Bhatta, executive director of the Payment Systems Department at Nepal Rastra Bank.As the central bank has allowed merchant payment on the purchase of goods and services, the PSOs have started taking approval to start the service, Bhatta said. By coordinating on issues like bank settlement and dispute settlement, the licensed private sector PSOs can start the service.The central bank said that the withdrawal limit for a Nepali in a foreign country would be according to the existing foreign exchange rule, which is $2,500 per visit and $5,000 annually. There are 10 PSOs operating in the country as of mid-May.The QR code system in Nepal is relatively new.Starting March 1, Indians were allowed to make payments through their mobile phones. The development was hailed as a milestone in cross-border digital payment between Nepal and India, facilitating the students and people going to India for medical purposes.Nepal’s Fonepay, a PSO, has partnered with India’s NPCI International Payments to launch the cross-border payment service using quick response (QR) codes.With the central bank's provision, Fonepay has already started working, allowing Nepali nationals to make QR code payments in India.On June 1 last year, Fonepay signed a memorandum of understanding with Sri Lanka’s National Payment Network—LankaPay, to collaborate on a strategic partnership to revolutionise the digital payment landscape by developing an interoperable digital payment system that enables users to transact seamlessly across the two countries.However, in the lack of regulations, the QR code payment system did not start. “We have requested the approval for QR code payment service with Sri Lanka. We will soon start the facility,” said Paras Kunwar, chief operating officer (COO) of Fonepay. “Besides Sri Lanka, China is another market that we are looking at. We have started discussions with China UnionPay and Alipay+ to make cross-border QR code payments.”In May 2019, Nepal banned WeChat Pay and AliPay, stating that online payments through unregistered systems were illegal and resulted in a loss of income for Nepal. WeChat Pay, operating on Tencent’s messaging service, and e-commerce giant Alibaba’s Alipay are the two dominant platforms in mainland China.In June last year, Chinese digital payment service WeChat Pay and NMB Bank Nepal partnered to make the mobile payment system available in Nepal, allowing Chinese nationals visiting Nepal to pay for their purchases using their mobile sets.Kunwar said they would begin a QR code system in India from August. “For this, Nepali commercial banks are working on transaction limits and other issues.“We also need to adhere to many provisions including anti-money laundering and combating the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) before starting the cross-border payment services.”Kunwar said that the company is looking for other potential markets overseas where most Nepalis reside. For instance, South Korea is another prospective market for QR code payment.“We are looking into whether remittances can be sent through QR code if the central bank allows it. Nepal can be a potential market for tourists from South Korea and Japan and the service can allow them to withdraw money in Nepal.”Just like regional economic blocs, the payment service has also started making regional payment blocs. There is Asian Payment Network, a retail payment platform supported by the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), Kunwar said.“There are 17 members of the Asian Payment Network of ASEAN, including Sri Lanka from South Asia. Fonepay recently became a member of the Asian Payment Network, and with this, we can integrate the system with the 17 member countries.”The QR code system has become a boon for tourists, especially those from India.For instance, within three months of starting QR code payments to Indian citizens, Fonepay is handling around Rs5 million transactions daily. It has reduced the hassle of carrying cash. The Nepal government has banned all Indian notes above the denomination of 100.With the Fonepay service available in Muktinath and trekking areas connected to Pokhara, Indian tourists are increasingly withdrawing money while in these areas. According to a central bank report, QR code transactions sharply increased to Rs52.75 billion in mid-May from Rs45.67 billion in mid-April, after Nepal allowed Indian citizens to make payment via QR code in Nepal. The number of transactions also increased to 17.63 million from 16.10 million during the review period.QR code transactions increased to Rs53.88 billion from mid-May to mid-June, with a total of 19.82 million transactions. \nPrime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal lost a vote of confidence at the House of Representatives on Friday, prompting President Ramchandra Paudel to trigger a new government formation process and KP Sharma Oli of the CPN-UML to claim the prime minister’s position with the backing of the Nepali Congress. Dahal lost his position as only 63 lawmakers gave him the vote of confidence, less than half the majority figure of 138 in the 275-member House.Of the 258 present, 194 lawmakers voted against the motion while one stayed neutral. Apart from the support of his own CPN (Maoist Centre), Dahal retained the support of only two parties in his government—the Rastriya Swatantra Party and the CPN (Unified Socialist). Other coalition partners stood against him. The prime minister saw a huge erosion in support from his first vote of confidence in January last year when he enjoyed an overwhelming support of over 98 percent of lawmakers. The support on Friday shrank to 22 percent of lawmakers, in the span of less than a year and half.Dahal had a constitutional obligation to face the vote of confidence after the CPN-UML, the largest party in the Dahal government, withdrew its support on July 3 after an agreement to form a new government together with the Nepali Congress.The country's largest communist party forged a deal with the Congress on July 1 to replace the Dahal government.Rejection of the motion was a given with the country's two largest parties—the Congress and the UML—partnered with some fringe parties against the government and the prime minister was aware of it. Yet the frustration at losing the prime ministerial berth was visible in his address to the House on Friday. He claimed that the two-party deal was not spontaneous but was well orchestrated by \"somebody else\".\"You didn’t unite on your own, someone else did [brought you together],\" he said while addressing the House. \"Why would the deal between the two largest parties be signed in a dark room if it was done with a good intent?\"The prime minister spent a half of his 80-minute speech presenting the achievements of his government made in a year and half since its formation in December 2022. The other half went to lashing out at the Congress-UML partnership. As the leader from both parties claim, their yet-to-be-disclosed deal is grounded in two themes: ensuring stability to drive the country on the path of prosperity and amending the constitution for the country's benefit. Through his address, Dahal gave a clear message that his party would make criticising these issues its primary task.“It is an open secret that you [the Congress and the UML] want to go back to 1990 in the name of stability. You are trying to remove inclusive principles and proportional representation in the name of stability,” said the prime minister. “Was there stability when you two parties had the system of your choice? Are you not the same parties that formed 15 governments between 1991 and 2005?”He accused the Congress and the UML of conspiring against the marginalised and underprivileged communities by amending the constitution. Claiming that the two traditional parties want to opt for electing the lower house fully under the first-past-the-post (FPTP) and making the National Assembly fully inclusive. This move according to Dahal is an attempt to deprive the people from minority and underprivileged communities from becoming the prime minister.Only a member of the House of Representatives is eligible to become the prime minister as per the constitution. “People are fully aware. Nobody can revoke the rights achieved through huge struggle and sacrifice,” said Dahal, warning multiple times that the country would head towards another conflict if the constitution was amended as planned by the two parties. The Maoist supremo also dared the two parties to amend the constitution without his party’s support.Though securing two-thirds majority in the lower house without the support of the Maoist Centre is possible, that is not the case in the upper house. With 17 seats excluding the chairperson, the Maoist Centre is the largest party in the National Assembly. An amendment to the constitution must be endorsed by the two-thirds majority of both chambers of Parliament. Dahal pointed out that, prior to the second people’s movement in 2006, Dalits’ representation was close to zero, women’s representation was hovering around 5 percent while the representation of janajatis and Madheshi’s was token. Their representation in state organs increased significantly after the Maoist party entered Parliament through the reinstated House of Representatives, he said. The inclusive provisions were later enshrined in the Interim Constitution first in 2007 and in the Constitution of Nepal drafted by the Constituent Assembly in 2015. The prime minister, however, said his party was ready for an amendment to the constitution not in squeezing proportional representation but for ensuring 50 percent women’s representation in the state machinery, increasing the representation of other marginalised communities and having a directly elected executive head of the country. The Maoist Centre has long been pushing for the directly elected executive head, right since the time of the Constituent Assembly. But, as the Congress refused to ditch the parliamentary system, its demand couldn’t materialise. Dahal was critical in his Friday speech towards the Congress as well but not as bitter as towards the UML and its chairman Oli. He said nobody can beat Oli in conspiracy. Stating that he agreed to switch the ruling partner from the Congress to the UML because Oli argued that if not united the Maoist Centre and the UML would meet the fate of the communist movement in West Bengal. “I believed that time changes people but I was wrong. Some people can never shed their ego,” said Dahal, hinting at Oli. Countering the UML’s call for him to resign on moral grounds, Dahal said, “Those who are habituated to dissolve parliament and their supporters tried to teach me moral lessons. I just want to stress that the CPN (Maoist Centre) has the highest level of investment in this constitution,” he said, asking the Congress to be vigilant that Oli can deceive it too. In turn, along with the UML and the Nepali Congress, other party lawmakers also countered Dahal. Speaking after him, Congress chief whip Ramesh Lekhak said the constitution would be amended without distorting its inclusive spirit. “You have every quality to become the opposition leader. It was our mistake to make you the prime minister repeatedly,” he said.Also addressing the House, UML lawmaker Yogesh Bhattarai asked Dahal to stop politics in the name of Dalits, janajatis and other marginalised communities. “Do you know what is the fate of Magars from Rolpa who waged the war for you? Do you have any idea what your Dalit supporters are doing these days?” Bhattarai asked. “You are in illusion, if you still think you can spark a conflict through provocative statements.” Gyan Bahadur Shahi, chief whip of the Rastriya Swatantra Party, was one of those who accused Dahal of not doing enough on his part when it comes to giving opportunity to those from dalit and indigenous communities.“Why didn’t you promote a leader from the adivasi community as the party chief just like we in the RPP have done,” Shahi said. “Why didn’t you appoint at least one dalit minister in your Cabinet?” \nWithin the rich heritage of Newa art, you might have heard of Paubha or Thanka, two types of cloth painting known for their religious iconography. Many tourists leave Nepal with at least one of the two tucked away in their suitcases, hoping to hang a unique reminder of their travels on their walls. But for foreigners and Nepalis alike, few have heard of Bilampau, an elusive narrative art style that may have been inspired by Paubha. Bilampau in Newa means horizontal painting.Though Paubha is a much more established and recognisable Newa art form, both Paubha and Bilampau are scroll paintings guided by Thyaa-saphu, folded sketchbooks that were kept by Newa families. Thyaa-saphu stipulates necessary thematic and narrative elements for Buddhist stories; Bilampau, for example, often begins with the figure of the narrator themselves, whether it be Lord Buddha—common in Buddhist scroll paintings—or Lord Ganesha, in the case of Hindu stories.But Madan Chitrakar, renowned artist, researcher, and scholar, reveals that the similarities between Paubha and Bilampau largely end there. “The subject matter and motifs are very different,” he says. While Paubha’s religious characteristics support meditation and worship, the importance of storytelling is prominent in Bilampau and its “narrative scroll” composition. Unlike Paubha, Bilampau depicts stories with multiple elements and episodes. This sequence is often established through a collection of frames on one scroll, though some Bilampau artworks utilise a single scroll without frame-by-frame separation. Swosti Rajbhandari Kayastha, museologist, curator for Nepal Art Council, and curator of the current Itumbaha museum exhibition, emphasises that Bilampau are not meant for veneration. “In ancient times, they didn’t have comic books, right?” she jokes. Instead, visual storytelling was done through creations like Bilampau.On June 18, 2024, Siddhartha Art Gallery opened its doors to the public for its most recent exhibition on Kalighat paintings, Ganjifa playing cards, and Bilampau. Though the gallery certainly focused on the legacy of Kalighat, all three art forms underscore the unique cultural ties between Nepal and India.At the opening, artist Chitrakar also spoke on the significance of Bilampau, calling it one of the most “misunderstood” forms in Nepali art history.What does it mean to truly understand an art form? And when it comes to the expansive depths of art history, what does it mean to remember an art form in its entirety? How can we revive a dying art form back into the collective consciousness of the twenty-first century?The earliest existence of the visual narrative technique in Nepal can be traced back to the 12th century, depicted not through scroll but through wood. Newa artists were also likely commissioned to create Bilampau for specific walls in Buddhist temples, hence its impressive horizontal length. Indeed, Bilampau also holds some surprising diversity in sizes and dimensions, with many ranging from nine feet to a whopping 78 feet in length—a testament to its visual significance.Comparisons can also be drawn between Bilampau and Patachitra, a cloth painting form based in West Bengal, Odisha, and Rajasthan. Both Bilampau and Patachitra were created by Chitrakar artists in India and Nepal, and the two forms also share a reputation for story-telling. However, Bilampau is more commonly horizontal, while Patachitra is typically vertical in its episodic visualisation.It is possible that Bilampau grew into its own art form from the influence of Patachitra, signifying another historical connection between India and Nepal, but so little is known about the evolution of Bilampau that it is difficult to come to a precise conclusion about its origins.Today, most traditional Buddhist Bilampau are kept in local monasteries. According to Chitrakar, one of the most famous Bilampau is currently held in Itum Bahal. Kayastha notes that the Bilampau in Itum Bahal depicts the foundation of the Itum Bahal monastery.During the Newa Gunla festival, which is celebrated according to the lunar calendar, the significance of Bilampau storytelling is also treasured amongst Vihara and Newa Buddhists. “For fifteen days,” Kayastha explains, “all the monasteries will display the objects they have in their storage, which people have donated over time. One of those objects would be the Bilampau.” Kayastha highlights that the Bilampau is not only a source of education regarding the monastery’s history but also a source of community engagement. Members of the community take it upon themselves to safeguard their heritage and cultural objects, usually sleeping in the same room as the Bilampau and other artefacts.At Siddhartha Art Gallery, there are two Bilampau, both depicting Hindu stories; due to the artistic shift towards Hinduism, the older Bilampau, consisting largely of Buddhist stories, is much less accessible.Bilampau is no longer an active form in traditional Nepali art, which means that truly understanding its significance also begets recognising its disappearance from popular Nepali art discourse. Despite being one of the earliest forms of visual story-telling in Nepal, “it is almost forgotten,” remarks Chitrakar.A quick Google search of ‘Bilampau’ results few substantial results except for a single scholarly article written by Chitrakar himself.The fear of this art form growing obsolete extends far beyond art history, just as art history itself holds broader implications on the importance of culture and identity.In Nepal, Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal declared that the country’s citizens share a common responsibility to protect traditional Indigenous culture, calling it the “identity and prestige” of Nepal as a whole.Traditional festivals and art forms are certainly still celebrated and recognised, whether it be on the streets of Kathmandu or within one of the city’s museums or galleries, but several artisans and scholars have shared their growing concerns about the future of traditional Nepali art.Many artists from the older generation, for example, fear that the younger generation will no longer continue the artistic practices—such as Paubha painting—that their families have inherited for generations.We must take it upon ourselves to raise awareness and actively engage with the artists and cultural significance that accompanies these forms—otherwise, our collective apathy might result in these traditions reaching the same untimely fate as Bilampau.Though Bilampau died out a century ago, one method of reviving its presence might entail a call for collectors to bring their Bilampau pieces forward, increasing public accessibility. For others, simply talking about Bilampau and remembering its place in history might be more than enough.“When we talk about Nepali art traditions,” says Chitrakar, “we must not miss Bilampau,” echoing the value in appreciating a lesser-known art form. And when we remember Bilampau, we must also hold on to the other art forms that are still surviving, carrying legacies that have spanned across entire wars, nations, and generations—and, if all goes well, with many more journeys to come. \nTo reduce patient deaths in hospital emergencies, the Ministry of Health and Population has initiated basic life support training for healthcare workers, including medical doctors, nurses, and paramedics, with the aim of significantly lowering emergency-related deaths.\nNepal’s Prime Minister Dahal resigns after a coalition government is formed between Nepali Congress and CPN-UML, raising concerns about the repetitive nature of coalition culture in the country.\nRampant corruption in Nepal involves senior officials and political parties, eroding public trust and hindering sustainable development efforts despite government arrests of low-level individuals.\nFatal interbreeding between wild and domestic animals threatens endangered species, and resolving the conflict between conservation and herders requires balancing protections for both.\nAmid criticism, India's Modi and Russia's Putin agreed to repatriate Indian soldiers fighting in Ukraine, in contrast to Nepal's ongoing struggle to bring back its citizens.\nProject 2025, a conservative policy proposal touted by some of Trump's closest advisers, is being used by opponents to highlight potential authoritarian dangers if Trump is re-elected.\nWritten by philosophy enthusiast Bishnu Sapkota, ‘Adiyeka Paila’ is a novel that explains the complicated dynamics of feelings in human relationships. Astitwa and Anasuya are the protagonists of the novel. Another character of the story, Bandana, stands to be the deuteragonist. And no, the book is not about the love triangle. Instead, it is about a candid narration of each character's feelings, which ultimately shape their life. Astitwa is introduced as a university teacher of Kirtipur. He teaches English literature to university students. Anasuya is an MBBS student. Astitwa and Anasuya meet through Anusaya’s father, Mani, a professor at Kirtipur University. To assist Astitwa with completing his thesis, Astitwa’s friend Pramod advises him to coordinate with Mani. Their first interaction is similar to the novel ‘Lolita’ setting. Astitwa, in his 20s, is seven years older than Anusuya, who is still a minor.Anasuya instantly falls for Astitwa upon seeing him in her house. Additionally, as an MBBS student passionate about literature, it's easy to see why Anasuya would develop an infatuation with someone knowledgeable, single, and a literature lover like herself.The pair starts going on dates, and their conversation often concerns philosophically defining love. Astitwa’s take on love combines all the principles he has absorbed as a university student. Contrary to this, Anasuya is introverted in expressing herself yet bolder and wiser when approaching matters of love. She postulates that love has little to do with rationality and reasoning. However, Astitwa states, “Love was made to ease the complexities of navigating societal norms and emotional landscapes. Therefore, there is no guarantee that tomorrow love will not wither.” The author has effectively assessed the maturity levels between boys and girls in love. His analysis addresses the widely debated and often clichéd notion that girls generally show more maturity than boys.The journey of their attraction blooming into love is characterised by beautiful butterfly moments that aren’t discussed in depth in other books I have read. The discourse surrounding such intricate details assures the reader like it has assured me, that it is expected to fixate on the qualities of someone you admire. The following dialogue perfectly captures the essence of one’s obsession. “After all, everyone is made up of the elements of feelings. No matter how many logical arguments we make, our actions are driven by our emotions”. The entire plot of the novel rests on a single premise, much like in movies, where an actor portrays various characters in different films, the roles in the novel shift and change based on the circumstances and contexts the characters face.Similarly, human beings play various roles in their own lives. Our existence is dynamic and multifaceted, enabling us to embody different versions of ourselves as we navigate different phases and experiences.The author’s background as a columnist may have inspired the progression of social issues in the novel. Astitwa’s students, Bandana and Mohan, are victims of the repercussions of the Maoist Conflict in Nepal. Mohan, a member of the Madhesi community, moves to Kathmandu to study for his master's. Once there, he gains a clearer perspective on the silent discrimination his community faces.An article by JB Pun Magar on the topic ‘Manu Smriti, Muluki Ain and the rise of Bahuns’ rightly captures the dilemma that Mohan faces regarding the accusations of the ruling caste where they maintain that indigenous people incite division with ethnicity-based federalism. At the same time, the indigenous people contend that the ruling class perpetuates racism through historical privilege and marginalisation of ethnic communities. Similarly, Bandana, who has lost her father during the Maoist insurgency, confides in Astitwa regarding her struggles with the grief of losing a parent. However, the bond that Anasuya and Astiwa share isn’t love, as the author mentions through his exaggerated explanation of love, feelings, and rationality.Either one has attachment issues, or, in modern language, they are in a “situationship”. The novel is slow running in its pace yet steadfast in developing new arcs in the plot. Before Bandana, Astitwa and Anasuya had already stopped talking to each other. This incident not only takes a toll on Anusuya's mental health but also disrupts her relationship with her parents.The fallout occurs because Astitwa insists that Anasuya reveal their relationship to her parents. Despite her opposition, Anasuya complies with her boyfriend's demands.Her parents are not entirely opposed to this new information, yet it is a task for them, especially the father, to accept that his daughter will grow up to be an adult. As the story unfolds, Astistwa receives a scholarship for his PhD program from Notre Dame University, one of the most prestigious universities in the US. After spending nearly six years in the US, Astitwa returned to Nepal despite the opposition of his colleagues from Kirtipur who had settled abroad.At this particular juncture, the author has painted the picture of the stark realities faced by many Nepali students studying abroad. The novel does not conclude with a typical Cinderella ending, where estranged lovers reconcile. Instead, it features a mature and unconventional ending, allowing readers to uncover the explanation as the story progresses gradually.However, the novel’s characters stand to be romantic and slightly idealised, which makes it difficult for an ordinary reader to fully encapsulate the duality and complexities portrayed by the author. In hindsight, the novel is an excellent portrayal of one’s deepest feelings, which are layered by the principles and conventions built by society around us. Through the characters, the author urges the readers never to eschew the inevitable waves of emotions that shape our deepest selves. Drawing from his experience living abroad, the author implies the importance of culture and native language in authentically expressing one’s emotions.Adiyeka PailaAuthor: Bishnu SapkotaPublisher: Fine PrintYear:2023 \nThe weather across the country is forecast to be partly to generally cloudy on Saturday.Light to moderate rain accompanied by thunder and lightning is expected in several regions, including Koshi Province, Karnali Province, Gandaki Province, Lumbini Province, and Bagmati Province.

On Friday, Dahal moved from his official residence in Baluwatar to his private residence in Khumaltar. \nPresident Joe Biden faced more calls from fellow Democrats to abandon his re-election bid on Friday, following a news conference in which he delivered nuanced responses but occasionally stumbled over his words.It was unclear whether Biden’s performance would convince doubters in his party that he is their best bet to defeat Republican Donald Trump in the Nov. 5 election and serve another four-year term in the White House.At least 17 congressional Democrats so far have called for him to drop out and allow the party to pick another standard-bearer, including some who announced their positions after the news conference on Thursday night.Democrats are worried that Biden’s low public approval ratings and growing concerns that he is too old for the job could cause them to lose seats in the House and Senate, leaving them with no grip on power in Washington should Trump win the White House.But Biden made clear that he did not plan to step aside.“If I show up at the convention and everybody says they want someone else, that’s the democratic process,” Biden said, before shifting to the stage whisper he often uses for emphasis to add, “It’s not gonna happen.”Biden perhaps did not reassure those who were spooked by his poor presidential debate performance against Trump on June 27.At one point, he referred to his vice president, Kamala Harris, as “Vice President Trump”. That came just hours after he introduced Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy as “President Putin” at the NATO summit, drawing gasps from those in the room.Biden occasionally garbled his responses at the news conference, yet he also delivered detailed assessments of global issues, including Ukraine’s war with Russia and the Israel-Gaza conflict, that served as a reminder of his decades of experience on the world stage.Some Democrats were not reassured.“We must put forward the strongest candidate possible to confront the threat posed by Trump’s promised MAGA authoritarianism. I no longer believe that is Joe Biden,” said Representative Jim Himes of Connecticut, who called on the president to end his campaign after the news conference.But one influential party figure, Representative James Clyburn of South Carolina, reiterated his support on Friday morning.“I am all in. I’m riding with Biden no matter which direction he goes,” he said on NBC’s “Today” program.A senior campaign official who spoke on condition of anonymity called the performance the “worst of all worlds. Not good. But not bad enough to make him change his mind ... It’ll give some enough cover to back him publicly, only to say he’s not up for it privately.”Fundraiser Dmitri Melhorn said other donors told him they saw a strong performance from the president. “This is the person who can beat Trump. The mistakes are baked in and the upside is strong,” he told Reuters.Biden will hold a rally on Friday in Detroit, where his campaign says he will focus on the “dangers” of Trump’s agenda.The Michigan city is also headquarters of the United Auto Workers labor union, whose leaders endorsed Biden but now are assessing their options, three sources told Reuters.With most US voters firmly divided into ideological camps, opinion polls show the race remains close.An NBC/PBS poll released on Friday found Biden leading Trump 50% to 48%, a slight increase from his position before the debate. Biden fared slightly worse than Trump when third-party candidates were included in the questioning.A Reuters/Ipsos poll released last week found Biden and Trump tied at 40% each. But some nonpartisan analysts have warned that Biden is losing ground in the handful of competitive states that will determine the outcome of the election. \nImports from China to Nepal rose more sharply than expected in the first eleven months of the current fiscal year ending mid-June, while imports from India continued to tumble.According to the Trade and Export Promotion Center, the national trade promotion body, Nepal’s imports from China increased by 34.8 percent in the review period. In comparison, imports from India fell by 3.1 percent.Experts attributed ballooning imports from China to a sharp rise in the entry of electric vehicles (EVs). Likewise, a fall in imports from India has been attributed to the export curbs on food by the southern neighbour. In terms of value, imports from China increased by Rs70.44 billion to Rs272.81 billion in the review period.Import from India, however, dropped by Rs29.53 billion to Rs908.30 billion in the period.Due to the drop in imports from India, Nepal’s total imports declined 1.8 percent to Rs1.45 trillion in the first eleven months of the current fiscal year, which ended mid-June 2024.An official of the National Statistics Office says for a consumption-driven economy, falling imports are a worrisome sign. This suggests people are spending less on services and consumption while exports are stagnant.Rabindra Duwadi, the spokesperson at the Trade and Export Promotion Center, said imports from the north were driven by a massive influx of EVs, smartphones, and readymade garments.Besides, exports of iron, chemical fertiliser, apples and readymade garments too rose significantly. Traders said that China fulfils 80 percent of Nepal's readymade garment needs. The country imported readymade garments worth Rs33.67 billion in the first 11 months of the current fiscal year.In the same vein, Nepal imported 7,931 EVs worth Rs21.83 billion from China in the first 11 months of the current fiscal year, up from 1,269 EVs worth Rs3.75 billion in the same period last fiscal year.Similarly, the country imported 1.23 million units of smartphones worth Rs17.27 billion from China in the review period. During the time, Nepal imported 99,965 tonnes of chemical fertiliser worth Rs8.69 billion from China.In the first 11 months of the current fiscal year, the country imported 65,827 tonnes of apples worth Rs6.98 billion from China, compared to 50,153 tonnes worth Rs4.73 billion in the same period last fiscal year.Duwadi said India’s share of Nepal’s total imports is 65.5 percent, while China contributes 18.8 percent. Traders say Nepal’s trade with India is vast, but it is steadily shifting to China. “One key reason for import growth from China is EVs,” said Rajan Sharma, a trade expert. “Chinese EVs are comparatively cheaper and perform better compared to Indian ones.” According to market observers, that’s why there has been an abrupt switch from India’s Tata Nexon EV to Chinese BYD.Sharma said readymade garments imported from China are cheaper compared to Indian readymade garments, including branded ones, which makes them popular among Nepali customers. “At the same time, India-made branded clothing items are expensive.”The Chinese Shein clothing brand has quickly gained popularity in Nepal due to its trendy clothes and reasonable prices.Trade experts say that due to the open border, there has been a massive rise in informal trade from India in recent years. Smuggling has thrived after India imposed a ban on foods.According to a research report titled, ‘Dynamics of informal cross-border trade in agricultural products between Nepal and India,’ prepared by South Asia Watch on Trade, Economics and Environment, only 40 percent of rice is imported from India through formal channels.India’s share in Nepal’s imports in formal trade is 60 percent, but the share of informal trade is likely to be higher.The research has pointed out that informal trade has thrived after the imposition of a 9 percent agriculture reform fee and a 2.5 percent advanced income tax, resulting in a total duty of 11.5 percent on rice imports.The paper said that India’s ban on rice and other agricultural exports has led to massive smuggling of food through the 1,800 km porous border between Nepal and India.Nepal is dependent on onions imported from India. When the Indian government imposed a ban on onion exports from December 2023 to May 2024, the product was readily available in the vegetable market and grocery stores, which indicated that a massive quantity of onions came through informal trade channels.The government did not take a single step to control the illegal trade or negotiate with the Indian government to ease the repeated bans on export of various agricultural goods. Nepal has thus lost out on huge import revenue as goods are coming to Nepal through illegal channels and are easily available in the market.Paras Kharel, executive director of the South Asia Watch on Trade, Economics and Environment, said overall imports have not been able to rebound in two fiscal years, reflecting the country’s economic slowdown. However, the rise in EV imports contributed to the sudden rise in imports from China.“Imports from Tatopani and Rasuwa customs rose by twice as much,” Kharel said. This shows that imports from China, which were halted after the Covid pandemic, are not gradually improving but are ballooning.According to the Department of Customs, the worth of imports from Tatopani customs increased to Rs37.16 billion in the first 11 months of the current fiscal year, compared to Rs11.79 billion in the same period last fiscal year.Similarly, the worth of imports from Rasuwa customs on the northern border increased to Rs55.45 billion in the review period, up from Rs27.25 billion in the same period last fiscal year. \nThe National Human Rights Commission has said that the Enforced Disappearances Enquiry, Truth and Reconciliation Commission Act must include war crimes and crimes against humanity as serious violations of human rights while also ensuring justice to former Maoist child soldiers.The constitutional human rights watchdog made its position public as the three major parties worked to finalise the amendment bill to the Act under consideration in a parliamentary committee. Neither the existing Act nor the amendment bill includes war crimes, crimes against humanity and the issues of child combatants. In its report “The National Human Rights Commission and Transitional Justice”, the commission has said that together with murder, enforced disappearance, abduction or disappearances after the kidnapping, torture, rape or other sexual violence, war crimes and crimes against humanity should also be classified as non-amnestiable crimes.The 150-page report the commission is set to unveil on Monday includes its position on the long-pending transitional justice process while also documenting the efforts it made to deliver justice to the war-era victims of human rights violations. Since its establishment in 2002, the commission has investigated 1,073 cases related to the 1996-2006 insurgency and recommended actions against 222 including former Home Secretary and chief of Nepal Police.Following successive governments’ reluctance to follow its recommendations, the commission made public the list of perpetrators in October 2020 and January 2024.The leaders in negotiation are still struggling to finalise whether to list murder as a serious violation of human rights. Despite long negotiations, they have yet to sort out issues of minor Maoist soldiers and sentence reduction. They are also divided on whether victims who refuse to reconcile should be allowed to take their cases to court.The commission’s report says killing any unarmed individual, regardless of their involvement in the conflict, or those not directly involved in the fight, is a serious violation of human rights. There cannot be amnesty for serious violations of human rights, including war crimes and crimes against humanity. Amnesty for other human rights violations is possible only with the written consent of the victims, according to the commission.“Those who refuse pardon should be allowed to seek legal remedy as per the existing laws,” reads the report. “The truth and Reconciliation Commission must delve into the cases of the victims who lost their lives or got injured in landmines planted during the insurgency even after the peace process began.” Issues of child Maoist combatants must be addressed through the law to ensure they get justice, according to the commission.The use of minors in armed conflict is a war crime as per international law. The ruling Maoist Centre, therefore, does not want to include this issue in the law.During the verification process for army integration conducted by UNMIN in 2007, thousands of Maoist fighters had been disqualified for being minors. Among the 4,008 combatants who did not qualify for integration, 2,973 were verified as minors, while the remaining 1,035 had joined the Maoist ‘People’s Liberation Army’ after the first ceasefire of May 26, 2006—six months before the signing of the peace deal. The government had provided between Rs500,000 and Rs800,000 each to the combatants who chose voluntary retirement. However, those who were disqualified didn’t get any substantial support, except for a few thousand rupees from the United Nations.A group of former child soldiers led by Lenin Bista have filed a writ petition at the Supreme Court demanding the prosecution of the then Maoist supreme commander Pushpa Kamal Dahal, now the country’s prime minister, and the then ‘people’s government’ chief Baburam Bhattarai, who also is a former prime minister. The final hearing for the petition has been slated for September.Unlike in other issues, the commission has stood with the political parties on reduced sentencing. “The jail term of convicts who meet the criteria [perpetrators cooperating in the investigation process], can be reduced to a minimum of 25 percent as per existing laws,” reads the report. “The criteria for reduced sentencing can be defined in the law.” Surya Dhungel, a commissioner, said their position is based on international practice where reduced sentencing is common in transitional justice process.The commission has also reiterated that it will send its representative to the panel formed to recommend office bearers in the two transitional justice mechanisms only if there is a commitment from the parties concerned to amend the Act. “We are firm in our decision. Commitment from top political leadership is a must for the commission to send its representative to the recommendation committee,” said Dhungel. \nIn the early 1980s, Nepal’s firebrand communist leader, Mohan Bikram Singh, split from his comrade Nirmal Lama to establish a radical political alternative. Lama and Singh had earlier revolted from the Communist Party of Nepal to establish their own faction after the party’s fourth convention in 1974. Among Singh’s trusted leaders were Mohan Baidya, Pushpa Kamal Dahal, CP Gajurel and Dev Gurung. But Singh was forced to spend most of the following years politically exiled in India. As a result, Baidya effectively captured the party, renaming it the Communist Party of Nepal (CPN), “Mashal,” pronounced slightly different from Lama’s CPN “Masal.” However, Baidya and many senior party leaders faced self-imposed demotion after the party suffered a strategic setback in the now infamous ‘Sector Scandal’. Baidya was forced to nominate Dahal as the party leader in 1989, a position Dahal has held for three and a half decades.During the first two decades of his leadership, Dahal reigned supreme, as his party led the country into a decade-long violent political conflict that claimed, by some estimates, over 16,000 lives. Despite substantial economic and political costs, the conflict accelerated Nepal’s transition from a semi-feudal society with an exclusive political system into a more inclusive and secular republic. To that end, the Dahal-led Maoist party received due recognition through a popular mandate of the 2008 first Constituent Assembly elections. But Dahal’s unnecessary distrust of Nepal’s more established political parties, which had played a considerable role in bringing his party back into the political mainstream, made him commit blunders and unseated him from a comfortable majority government. His suspicion against fellow comrades who questioned his leadership style and decisions led to multiple splintering of the Maoist party. An insecure leaderDespite leading the country in and out of a transformative political conflict and becoming one of the key signatories of the new constitution, Dahal has remained an insecure leader who takes every opportunity to remind the Nepali people and the world about his “revolutionary contributions”. Possibly, this deep-seated insecurity emerges from the fact that he is neither seen as an intellectually gifted politician like his fellow comrade Baburam Bhattarai, who is known as an ideologue of the Maoist conflict or as a leader with integrity and simplicity like that of his political gurus Singh and Baidya. The thought of losing the political legacy of the ‘People’s War’ despite clinging onto the leadership of the party must constantly haunt the Maoist supremo.Dahal’s insecurity and political hypocrisy were also palpable in the way he derided the Madhesh Movement, which also raised the agendas of federalism and inclusion. Instead of considering them allies, Dahal ordered his party cadres to attack the Madheshi party leaders and their cadres. A large part of the political onus of escalating the tensions leading to the unfortunate Gaur massacre in 2007 will always rest on Dahal. Over the past decade and a half, Dahal has repeatedly failed to display the leadership he is ironically fond of discussing. Despite mobilising thousands of Tharu youths during the conflict, he failed to support their genuine claims on provincial boundaries during the federal structuring. And despite claims of his ‘one-sided love’ for Madhesh, he remained silent as more than 50 Madhesi protesters were indiscriminately killed by the security forces in 2015. Unreliable coalition partnerThere was a time when Dahal led a party that had shaken the country’s political core. Less than two decades later, he now leads a party that has mostly eroded its political base and only relies on a stronger coalition partner to remain relevant. But has Dahal even proved to be a reliable coalition partner? Let’s take a closer look. After Baidya split the party in 2012, the CPN-Maoist was reduced to the third position in the second Constituent Assembly elections, a significant loss from its commanding majority in the first CA. In the following two years, Dahal’s party was not only kept out of power but also forced to endorse a constitution that the Nepali Congress and rival communist party CPN-UML tabled. Having lost the capacity to dictate the political course, Dahal resorted to coalition politics. When the opportunity came, he supported UML’s Khadga Prasad Oli to cobble up a coalition government in October 2015. However, when the Nepali Congress offered him to lead a new coalition, he abandoned Oli and became Prime Minister in 2016. With the 2017 elections on the horizon, Dahal knew his party would not be able to compete with the larger parties that had successfully led the constitution drafting. With some active external mediation, Dahal persuaded Oli for an electoral alliance and even agreed to an eventual unification of the communist forces. When the left unity won a landslide victory, Dahal was convinced that Oli would honour the agreement to hand over power to him mid-way through the four-year period. When Oli refused, he split the united CPN in 2020, convincing several disgruntled leaders like Madhav Nepal to abandon the party and join a coalition with the Nepali Congress. The new coalition also offered Dahal and his party a comfortable division of electoral seats in the 2022 local, provincial and federal elections. But soon after the elections were over, Dahal bargained for power with both Deuba and Oli. Despite having won only 32 seats in the federal parliament with only 11 percent popular vote, Dahal managed to become Nepal’s 33rd Prime Minister in December 2022.Impending downfallIn 2014, political analyst CK Lal had told me that Dahal’s political opportunism would make him relevant in Nepali politics for at least another decade. The Nepali Congress and the CPN-UML took exactly a decade to realise that Dahal had been cashing in on Nepal’s fractured politics. This week, the two parties agreed that Nepal’s long-term political stability requires an introspection into the present electoral system, which allows electorally less popular outfits to dictate the course of national politics. So, not only have the two large parties decided to pull the plug on the Dahal government, but they also agreed to form an independent commission to study and propose amendments to the current electoral provision.While there is little disagreement that the current electoral system paved the way for more representation of the hitherto marginalised sections, the opportunity to correct inefficacies like expensive election campaigning and manipulation of the proportional candidacy lists by the parties must not be dismissed either. There are also serious doubts about the intention of the two parties to strike a deal at a time when the Nepal Police and the Commission for the Investigation of Abuse of Authority are investigating some high-profile corruption cases. It is up to the two parties to vindicate their intent by ensuring that the new political course does not interfere in these investigations. And even if the two parties agree to amend the constitutional provisions regarding elections, they will need to gather a national consensus or at least a two-thirds majority. Whatever happens in the next few weeks and months, it is evidently clear Pushpa Kamal Dahal’s eventual political downfall is on the horizon. \nIn 2019-20, Nepal imported 236 units of passenger electric vehicles (EVs) from China worth some Rs674 million. In the past five years, imports of EVs from China jumped 35 times, suggesting EV adoption in Nepal is now outpacing that of conventional combustion vehicles which use engines that burn fossil fuels, such as petrol or diesel. The EVs have overtaken conventional combustion vehicles.The imports of fossil fuel-consuming passenger vehicles were 10,310 units worth Rs9.24 billion in 2019-20. After four years, in the first 11 months of the current fiscal year, imports of conventional combustion vehicles were down to 3,537 units worth Rs4.21 billionHowever, overall vehicle imports have jumped from Rs65.02 billion in 2019-20 to Rs80 billion in the first 11 months of 2023-24.According to the Department of Customs, Nepal imported 11,466 units of EVs worth Rs29 billion in the first 11 months of the current fiscal year, or by mid-June. The imports were 3,870 units worth Rs11.23 billion in the same period last fiscal year. Of the total EV imports, a third came from China. Customs data show that Nepal imported 7,931 units of EVs from China, accounting for 69 percent of the total EV imports in the first 11 months of the current fiscal year. This translates to Rs21 billion in value.After China, the majority of EVs were imported from India. In the review period, imports from India amounted to Rs6 billion, or 3,277 units. Until the last fiscal year, India was Nepal’s top EV supplier.The data show that Nepal imported 2,205 EVs worth Rs5.94 billion from India in the last fiscal year. In the same period, imports from China were 1,269 units worth Rs3.75 billion.Nepal’s imports of EVs jumped sharply by 158.23 percent in the first 11 months of the current fiscal year. Importers say BYD, a Chinese multinational, has taken over the Nepali market. The government collected revenue of Rs13.06 billion from the import of EVs in the review period.Akash Golchha, senior vice president of the Nepal Automobile Dealers Association, said the ongoing economic slowdown has not stopped Nepalis from buying EVs. However, petrol or diesel-run vehicle sales could have been better.EV sales and orders saw a dramatic surge before the budget was announced on May 28. Cimex Inc Pvt Ltd, the authorised distributor of BYD Auto Industry Co Ltd in Nepal, said it had achieved a milestone by delivering 50 cutting-edge BYD EVs in a single day on May 18. According to the company, all 50 units were sold from its service centre at Guheshwari, Kathmandu.According to Cimex, the company imported 4,000 EVs in the first 11 months of the current fiscal year. The import of Chinese EVs is high due to their larger production compared to India, said the company, which is among the top EV brands in Nepal.BYD’s Atto and Dolphin are the most preferred models among Nepali customers. With the recent hike in excise and customs duties, the company said the new price list of BYDs will be unveiled soon.“There was fear among buyers that the government may raise duty on EVs in the budget. As a result, the demand surged dramatically,” said Golchha. “The high import increased the stock of EVs.”Automobile dealers said that the government hiked the duty on EVs by 10 percent in the budget for the coming fiscal year 2024-25, which, however, may not impact the sales.Golchha said the government did not make drastic changes in the import duty of EVs in the budget, which may help EV sales boom in the coming days. “The EV demand will grow at a faster pace.”Auto dealers say the import boost for EVs is mainly due to banks’ easy financing. Banks lend up to 90 percent of the vehicle’s cost.Finance Minister Barsha Man Pun, in the annual budget for the upcoming fiscal year, revised the customs and excise duty rates on the import of EVs. The customs duty on EVs of up to 50 kW has been increased to 15 percent from 10 percent, while a 5 percent excise duty has been imposed on them.Likewise, the government increased the customs and excise duties on EVs of 50-100 kW by 5 percent. As per the revised tariffs, the customs duty has been increased to 20 percent from 15 percent, while the excise duty has been increased to 15 percent from 10 percent.The customs duty on 100-200 kW has been raised to 30 percent from 20 percent. Similarly, those in categories 200-300 kW and more than 300 KW will be subject to customs duty of 60 percent and 80 percent, respectively. In these vehicles, the indirect tax has been raised by 20 percent each.According to EV traders, the market is flooded with various EV models, features, and looks, and customers have options to select according to their needs. They said that EVs ranging from Rs4 million to Rs5.5 million have a large customer base, while high-priced EVs are also seeing good sales.EV traders said that despite the market slowdown, the EV sector has not been affected.“One interesting emerging trend is that people who already own conventional combustion vehicles are also buying EVs,” said Golchha. \nDespite the Finance Minister's claim of Nepal's complete road network connectivity, Humla district remains disconnected due to the lack of a bridge over the Karnali river, resulting in high costs, transportation challenges, and inflated prices.\nIn an interview, Pyakuryal, a PhD holder in Public Affairs, analyzes Nepal's political stability, narratives, patriarchy, and emerging trends.\nKey events unfold as characters confront challenges, make choices, and navigate conflicts, ultimately leading to significant outcomes or changes.\nCrucial events unfold, shaping destinies and altering the course of history.\nSri Lanka's rich culture, natural resources, and tourist destinations make it an attractive destination, despite the recent financial crisis, which is now improving due to increased tourism.\nPushpa Kamal Dahal secured the vote of confidence in four consecutive tries after becoming the prime minister on December 25, 2022, but when he goes for his fifth on Friday, he is almost sure to fail.After CPN-UML, the largest coalition partner, withdrew its support to the government on July 3, Prime Minister Dahal has been leading the minority government.Soon after the UML withdrew its support, the Janata Samajbadi Party, led by Ashok Rai, also pulled the plug on the government. The CPN-UML has 77 seats and the newly formed Rai-led party has 7 seats in the House of Representatives.Dahal on July 5 decided to go for the floor test after the UML’s withdrawal of the support.Dahal opted for the floor test in accordance with Article 100(2) of the constitution which says, “If the political party which the prime minister represents is divided or a political party in coalition government withdraws its support, the prime minister shall table a motion in the House of Representatives for a vote of confidence within thirty days.”Dahal, who had the support of 268 lawmakers in his first attempt at a floor test, is likely to see that vote slashed by almost 200 this time.As things stood on Thursday, Dahal is most likely to get 32 votes from his CPN (Maoist Centre), 21 from the Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP) and 10 from the CPN (Unified Socialist).The parliamentary party meeting of Unified Socialist on Thursday decided to give Prime Minister Dahal the trust vote.Though the RSP has called a meeting of its parliamentary party on Friday morning, a party lawmaker said, “Since we have been continuing in the government despite being in a minority, we are morally bound to give the vote of trust to Prime Minister Dahal.”On July 4, RSP leaders had announced they’d quit the government but ministers from the party met the prime minister later that day and decided not to resign immediately. They said they backtracked on their plan after the prime minister sought their support until the floor test.To secure a majority in the 275-strong House, one needs 138 votes.The Congress and the UML, which have 88 and 77 House of Representatives seats, respectively, have already decided to vote against Prime Minister Dahal. Likewise, the Rastriya Prajantra Party, which has 14 seats, has also decided to vote against Dahal.The Janata Samajbadi Party Nepal, led by Upendra Yadav, and the Janata Samajbadi Party, led by Ashok Rai, which have 5 and 7 seats, respectively, have said they will vote against Dahal.The Loktantrik Samajbadi Party, which has four seats in the House, is also standing against Dahal during the floor test. “Our party is a member of the democratic alliance led by the Nepali Congress,” Ram Parkash Chaudhary, a lawmaker of the party, told the Post. “Therefore, we will vote against Prime Minister Dahal.”Dahal also will not get the trust vote of the Nagarik Unmukti Party. “Since our party has already withdrawn support to the Dahal government, our party will stand against him during the floor test,” Ranjita Shrestha, a lawmaker of the party, told the Post.The CK Raut-led Janamat Party, which has six seats in the lower house, will also stand against Prime Minister Dahal. “The party has already decided to stand against Prime Minister Dahal’s trust motion,” Abdul Khan, a lawmaker of the party, said.After the November 2022 election, Dahal, chief of the third-largest party in the House, continuously led the government for over one-and-a-half years exploiting the support of both the Congress and the UML, by turn. During this period, the UML backed Dahal two times while the Congress supported him once to form the government.Dahal first became the prime minister with the UML’s support. But the Congress was bent on breaking the UML-Maoist alliance and supported him in the vote of confidence after his swearing-in.After that, Dahal and Deuba started hobnobbing. When Dahal decided to support Congress candidate Ramchandra Paudel in the presidential election, the UML withdrew its support to the Dahal government on February 26, 2023.When Dahal faced the second floor test on March 20, he secured 172 votes in the House.Dahal, during the second trust vote, was supported by the Congress, Rastriya Swatantra Party, Janata Samajbadi Party Nepal (before the party split), Unified Socialist, Janamat Party, Loktantrik Samajbadi Party, Nagarik Unmukti Party, three independent lawmakers and a lawmaker of Rastriya Janamorcha.On March 4, Dahal broke its coalition with the Congress to join hands with the UML. He then went for the floor test for the third time on March 13.In his third floor test, Dahal received 157 votes from the UML, RSP, Janata Samajbadi Party, Unified Socialist, and Nagarik Unmukti Party, in addition to his own party.Meanwhile, Dahal again went for the floor test on May 20, for the fourth time, just two months after his third attempt. This time, he had to seek the parliament’s confidence after a group of seven lawmakers from his coalition partner Janata Samajbadi Party Nepal split the party and formed a new outfit under Ashok Rai’s leadership on May 5.After the party split, JSP-Nepal chair Upendra Yadav withdrew its support to the government. In the subsequent floor test, Dahal garnered 157 votes.Out of 12 political parties in the House of Representatives, along with the first and second largest parties—the Congress and the UML—other 10 parties and five independent lawmakers supported Dahal when he sought a vote of trust for the first time after the 2022 election.In the hung parliament, there are only two scenarios to form the government. Either the Congress and the UML should come together, or one of them should build the majority with the support of other fringe parties to form the government.This time, the Congress and the UML decided to forge a partnership despite the odds. As per the understanding between the two parties, UML chief KP Sharma Oli will lead a ‘national consensus government’ for a year and a half. After that, Sher Bahadur Deuba, the Congress president, will succeed him for the remaining term of the House. \nIt has been over a week since the Nepali Congress and CPN-UML agreed to form a new government under the leadership of the CPN-UML chair KP Oli, but they have yet to settle the ministry-wise portfolio division.Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal, who lost his majority after the UML and other parties withdrew their support, will face a vote of confidence on Friday as required by the constitution. This will be Dahal’s fifth floor test since becoming the prime minister in December 2022. It is almost certain that he will not secure the majority, which means President Ram Chandra Poudel will have to call for the formation of a new government. As soon as the prime minister fails the vote, Speaker Devraj Ghimire will inform President Poudel of the results. The UML is planning to claim the formation of the new government with the support of over two-thirds of the lawmakers, a central committee member of the party told the Post.But it is not clear whether the President will appoint Oli as the next prime minister after the UML submits the signature of the two-thirds lawmakers or he will give political parties one to three days to form a new government under Article 76 (3).President Poudel is consulting his team as well as his advisors, said an aide.As per the initial power-sharing agreement between Deuba and Oli, Congress will get 11 ministries and the UML will get 10. But as more parties have decided to extend support to Oli, they will need to accommodate other fringe parties in the government.Despite these preparations, the Congress and the UML have yet to finalise their nominees for ministers. Oli is likely to be sworn in on Tuesday once the prime minister election process is completed. Sources citing an informal agreement between the two parties said the Congress will lead the home and foreign affairs ministries, and the UML finance and defence ministries.“We are lobbying for General Secretary Gagan Thapa to lead the Congress team in the new government,” Bishwa Prakash Sharma, another general secretary of the party, told the Post. Thapa is interested to lead the Ministry of Home Affairs, but Congress chief Sher Bahadur Deuba wants Ramesh Lekhak as the new home minister, according to Congress leaders. “If Thapa leads another ministry, but is given the position of deputy prime minister, he should join the government,” said Sharma.Dozens of lawmakers have expressed their intent to become ministers this time, so the party’s leadership, including Deuba, is in a difficult situation regarding whom to send and whom not to.Deuba's spouse, Arzu Rana, is widely expected to be the next foreign minister. Other potential Congress ministers include Chandra Bhandari, Jeevan Pariyar, Tejulal Chaudhary, and Ajay Chaurasiya, among others. Besides Thapa, senior Nepali Congress leaders like Prakash Man Singh and Krishna Prasad Situala, among others, are also interested in leading the party in the new Cabinet, according to sources. General Secretary Sharma, however, told the Post that he would not join the new government. Singh, due to his senior position inside the party and the support he had extended in the past to help Deuba win the party presidency, has a high chance of leading the Congress team in the government, if General Secretary Thapa does not join the government, according to Nepali Congress leaders. Thapa has reportedly set some conditions, including deputy prime ministership, for him to lead the party’s team in the Oli Cabinet.Although Sharma claimed that they would lobby for Thapa, Thapa himself, speaking at a function in Biratnagar on Thursday, said he would not join the new government.“I have told the party leadership that I will work as general secretary and not join the government,” said Thapa.He also claimed that as soon as the process of forming the new government begins, the seven-point agreement signed between Oli and Deuba at midnight of July 1 will be made public.“We will discuss with the party president on Friday about sending the Congress team in the government under Thapa’s leadership,” said Sharma. However, UML chief Oli, who is all set to become the new prime minister, is reportedly against having the deputy prime minister portfolio this time. That is one major reason why the two parties have been unable to finalise the portfolio division.If the post of deputy prime minister remains, UML’s Bishnu Poudel, who previously served in that role, might be appointed deputy prime minister and finance minister, according to UML leaders. However, Oli is not keen on bringing Poudel into the Cabinet, according to the leaders. Padma Aryal, UML's party secretary, said a secretariat meeting of the party on Wednesday had already entrusted Oli with selecting ministers.There is also a long list of aspirants in the UML hoping to become ministers in the new Oli Cabinet. If the deputy prime minister portfolio is removed, Oli is likely to pick Rishikesh Pokhrel as the next finance minister, according to the leaders. Pokhrel is the chairman of the Public Account Committee of the House of Representatives. \nAs the parliamentary special probe committee formed to investigate the crisis-ridden cooperatives started discussion with cooperative victims, most of the representatives invited at the committee demanded investigations into Gorkha Media Network chairman GB Rai and then managing director Rabi Lamichhane, who is now deputy prime minister and home minister.Though the committee had invited victims from various cooperatives, most of those who shared their grievances at the parliamentary probe panel’s meeting on Wednesday spent most of their time demanding inquiry on the embezzlement of deposits that were rerouted to the media company, according to a member of the parliamentary special committee.Home Minister Lamichhane was managing director of the media company that ran the now-defunct Galaxy 4K Television before he joined politics in June 2022. GB Rai, who is at large, is believed to have fled the country.In its terms of reference (ToR), the committee has divided the cooperatives it has to investigate into two categories. It has listed the 20 cooperatives declared problematic ones by the government’s Crisis-ridden Cooperatives Management Committee in its schedule 1 and nine others including those linked to the Gorkha Media Network in the schedule 2.The committee had planned to first listen to the victims who deposited money in the cooperatives listed in the schedule 1 and then move on to schedule 2.After listening to the cooperative victims’ grievances on Wednesday, the committee members decided to hold discussions on the cooperatives listed in the schedule 2.“Soon, the parliamentary special probe committee will start discussion on the fourth point [that mentions the schedule 2],” Lekh Nath Dahal, a member of the parliamentary special probe committee, told the Post.As per the ToR, the probe panel will conduct a study and make recommendations on resolving legal and institutional issues faced by cooperatives and on regulations, supervision, and transparency of their financial systems.Coordinators of various struggle committees formed by cooperative victims were also present during the discussion. Chair of the parliamentary probe panel, Surya Thapa, a lawmaker from CPN-UML, said that they invited the representatives to listen to their grievances as the victims’ suggestions would be crucial in reaching a conclusion on the matter.Speaking in a discussion with the House committee, Shaligram Duwadi, a victim of Sahara Multi-Purpose Cooperatives from Chitwan, said that Rs510 million was rerouted from the cooperative to the Gorkha Media Network.“We tried to lodge the complaint against Gorkha Media Network with Chitwan Police but they refused to register our complaint after they saw the name of Gorkha Media Network,” Duwadi was quoted as saying by a member of the special probe committee. “Why was the case not registered by Chitwan Police?”Likewise, the committee member said Krishna Pariyar, a cooperative victim of Swarnalaxmi Saving and Credit Cooperative of Kathmandu, also accused Home Minister Lamichhane of abusing state power by not letting him withdraw his money and cash his cheque.“Though the victims of many cooperatives were present in the meeting today [Wednesday], the discussion was more focused on the chairman and managing director of Gorkha Media Network,” said the committee member.According to the committee member, the victims stressed that no matter how powerful these two people [Rai and Lamichhane] are, they should be booked under the law.The parliamentary special probe committee invited representatives from 29 cooperatives mentioned in the ToR but most of those present at the meeting were victims from the cooperatives linked to the media company, according to committee members.“Though victims from other cooperatives were also present at the committee meeting, most of them were those whose money was embezzled by the Gorkha Media Network,” Ishwari Devi Neupane, a probe committee member representing Nepali Congress, told the Post. Listed under schedule 2 of the ToR or linked to the media company are: the Ideal Yamuna Multipurpose Cooperative, the Image Saving and Credit Cooperative, the Sahara Saving and Cooperative, the Samanata Saving and Credit Cooperative, the Sano Paila Saving and Credit Cooperative, the Supreme Saving and Credit Cooperative, the Suryadarshan Saving and Credit Cooperative, the Sumeru Saving and Credit Cooperative and the Swarnalaxmi Saving and Credit Cooperative.Reportedly, money from Butwal-based Supreme Saving and Credit Cooperative, Suryadarshan Saving and Credit and Cooperative of Pokhara, Sahara Saving and Cooperative of Chitwan, Swarnalaxmi Saving and Credit Cooperative of Kathmandu, Sano Paila Saving and Credit Cooperative of Birgunj, and Nepalgunj’s Samantha Saving and Credit Cooperative has been rerouted to the Gorkha Media Network.Before this, the committee held discussions with top government officials including Secretary of the Ministry of Home Affairs Ek Narayan Aryal and Inspector General of Police (IGP) Basanta Bahadur Kunwar, among other officials, on July 4 to discuss the cooperatives under investigation.On the same day, Central Investigation Bureau (CIB) Chief Shyam Gyawali and Crime Investigation Department Chief Tek Bahadur Tamang were also called for the discussion.As per a probe committee member, some committee members grilled IGP Kunwar about his previous statement in the State Affairs and Good Governance Committee. Speaking at the parliamentary committee in the last week of March, the Nepal Police chief had claimed that police had found no evidence of Home Minister Lamichhane’s involvement in cooperative fraud.“When I made the statement in the State Affairs and Good Governance Committee about the home minister, his involvement in the scam had not been disclosed,” a committee member quoted IGP Kunwar as saying at the special committee meeting. Another member of the probe committee, Shishir Khanal, said the IGP said he was not under any pressure to give a statement about Home Minister Lamichhane. Khanal is a lawmaker from the Lamichhane-led Rastriya Swatantra Party.“The IGP said that he spoke on the basis of facts and that no information regarding Home Minister Lamichhane’s involvement in the cooperatives scam had been found till the day he made the statement.”Also, the committee held discussions with chiefs and representatives of various panels formed since 1990 to probe irregularities in the cooperative sector.The parliamentary special panel will make recommendations on safeguarding depositors’ savings, and quick and easy refunds for victims whose deposits have been embezzled.The panel also agreed to probe crisis-ridden cooperatives and fast-track the refund process for the depositors of the cooperatives concerned.The parliamentary special probe committee began its work a month ago after a month-long discussion with top officials from government agencies as well as chiefs and members of various panels formed so far by the government to look into problems involving cooperatives. \nPrime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal has said that CPN-UML Chairman KP Sharma Oli had hatched a conspiracy against him and the government and joined hands with the Nepali Congress to form a new coalition by dismantling the UML-Maoist Centre alliance prematurely.The four-month-long partnership between Dahal and Oli collapsed after the UML chief sealed a yet-to-be-disclosed seven-point agreement with Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba on the midnight of July 2. Speaking at a meeting of the Maoist Centre’s parliamentary committee on Wednesday, the embattled prime minister accused Oli of betraying him. After the UML recalled its ministers from the Dahal Cabinet and withdrew its support to the government, Dahal is seeking the vote of confidence in the House of Representatives on Friday.“Oli betrayed me for no reason,” said Dahal. “We came to know that the Nepali Congress and the UML were inching towards a political deal but Oli lied to me several times about it.”On the morning of July 2, Dahal and Oli had a three-hour-long conversation at his residence in Baluwatar but Oli did not tell him the truth about what he had agreed with Deuba. “If you are going to become the prime minister with the support of Nepali Congress, I will quit and help you,” Dahal shared with the party’s lawmakers about what he had told Oli. But Oli had flatly denied having reached an agreement with the Congress, according to Maoist leaders.Hitraj Pandey, the chief whip of the Maoist Centre, quoted Dahal as saying that Oli did not want to inform him about the deal with Deuba. According to Congress and UML leaders, Deuba, Oli and second rank leaders of both parties had met regularly for months ahead of the July 2 deal.After second-rank leaders worked out the fundamentals of the new political deal and power-sharing, Deuba and Oli gave it a final touch at midnight on July 2 at the residence of a businessman.Dahal and Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Home Affairs Rabi Lamichhane have been claiming that after the arrest of Bechan Jha in the fake Bhutanese refugee case, Deuba and Oli joined forces in order to protect some of their close aides and family members. According to Nepal Police officials, Jha, who claimed to be an influential power broker, had established good connections with top Congress and UML leaders. Citing their initial findings of interrogation with other suspects they had arrested, police said individuals had given millions of rupees to Jha to facilitate their travel to the United States on the guise of Bhutanese refugees. Some of the accused who masterminded the fake Bhutanese refugee scam are in police custody. Jha’s arrest made the Congress and UML leaders fearful of being arrested, said the Maoist and Swatantra Party leaders. Briefing his party’s lawmakers, Dahal said that he then telephoned Deuba to know what exactly had happened between them. Deuba’s reply was that he and Oli had already reached a deal. He reportedly turned down Dahal's offer to lead the government, according to Pandey.But UML leaders, including their general secretary Shankar Pokhrel, Deputy General Secretary Pradeep Gyawali and others, claimed that after Dahal returned from New Delhi, he started negotiations for new government formation with Deuba and offered him the leadership of a national government.“After we came to know that the prime minister was hatching a conspiracy and going to destabilise the country's politics by changing the ruling partners, we decided to initiate talks with the Congress for the sake of forming a stable government, giving people hope and amending some constitutional provisions,” UMl leaders said. Dahal returned from New Delhi on June 10 after attending the swearing-in ceremony of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.Dahal is seeking a vote of confidence on Friday. On Wednesday, the Nagarik Unmukti Party also decided to withdraw the support extended to the Dahal government. The government has already been reduced to a minority after the UML pulled the plug on it last week.“We will talk to all political parties and seek their support,” said Pandey, the Maoist Centre chief whip. The prime minister will mull his resignation only after the vote of trust in the House, said Pandey. Dahal, who was elected prime minister as per Article 76 (2) of the constitution, claims that the next government will be formed as per Article 76 (3) of the constitution. If the President upholds the spirit of the constitution, he should call for new government formation as per Article 76 (3), Pandey said. \nIn a bid to lessen the spread of the dengue virus during the ongoing monsoon season, the Kathmandu Metropolitan City has decided to continue the drive to destroy mosquito larvae and breeding grounds. Officials at the health department of the city office said on Friday that they have just completed a week-long drive in all 32 wards of the metropolis and plan to continue these efforts in the coming days as well.“Every Wednesday, our health volunteers will visit households and open spaces to destroy mosquito breeding grounds,” said Rishi Bhusal, epidemic prevention and control focal person at the metropolis. “Decisions on preventive measures including launching search and destroy drives will depend on the spread of virus and intensity of rainfall in the coming days.”Dengue is a viral disease transmitted by female Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes. The same vectors also transmit chikungunya, yellow fever, and Zika virus, according to the World Health Organisation.According to data provided by the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division, at least 1,268 people from 72 districts have been infected with the dengue virus since January this year. Among the 72 districts that reported dengue outbreaks, Kathmandu has the highest number of cases: 141. Public health experts say reported cases could be just the tip of the iceberg, as around 80 percent of those infected are asymptomatic. Many people infected with dengue show mild symptoms and can be treated with paracetamol at home.Dengue symptoms include mild to high fever, severe muscle pain, rashes, severe headache, and pain in the eyes. Patients with these symptoms are advised to seek immediate treatment. While there is no specific cure for the disease, early detection and proper medical care can prevent death.Nepal reported its first dengue case in a foreigner in 2004 in the Chitwan district. Since then, an increasing number of dengue infections have been reported from many districts, including major dengue outbreaks. Last year, at least 20 persons died, and more than 52,000 were infected by the virus, which had spread to all 77 districts.In 2022, a total of 88 people died, and over 54,000 were infected by the virus across the country. During that period, hospitals in the Kathmandu Valley were overwhelmed with dengue patients, and pharmacies ran out of paracetamol, the most widely used medicine to treat fever.In 2019, the disease killed at least six people and more than 16,000 were hospitalised across the country. The virus had spread to 68 districts at the time.Though the post-monsoon period is considered the dengue epidemic season, the deadly disease has already become endemic in Nepal, as outbreaks of the virus are reported every month, including in the winter months.Officials at the health department said that 654 health workers, including female community health volunteers, were deployed in the week-long campaign, which concluded on Friday.“Volunteers and health workers who were deployed to the door-to-door campaign checked the mosquito breeding grounds and the larvae, made people aware about the risks and destroyed the breeding grounds,” said Bhusal. Health workers reported that storage places for scrap materials, discarded cups, and plastic in open spaces, and unused lands as potential hotspots for the dengue virus in the coming days. Health workers have warned owners of these sites that action will be taken if mosquito larvae are found against the owner of the storage place if mosquito larvae were found.Dengue-transmitting mosquitoes breed in clean water and bite people in daylight. Uncovered water tanks and discarded objects, such as plastic cups and bottles, could be breeding grounds for these mosquitoes.Public health experts say now is the right time to prepare for and prevent possible outbreaks. Health ministry officials said they have alerted all related agencies to the risk of a dengue outbreak. \nThe Kathmandu Metropolitan City has imparted mental health screening training to doctors and paramedics serving at urban health promotion centres.Officials at the Health Department in the metropolis hope that the move will help hundreds of patients with mental health issues in the city to get timely treatment.“Getting free treatment for mental health problems comes under the right to get free basic health care services,” said Sajina Maharjan, acting head of the department. “Mental health problem screening training to doctors and paramedics will help in the timely diagnosis of the problems and start of early treatment.”At least 32 doctors serving at the urban health promotion centres under the city office and dozens of paramedics participated in five-day screening training. The metropolis has upgraded its urban health clinics to urban health promotion centres and started providing services through medical doctors. “Due to the lack of doctors at our urban health promotion centres, patients suffering from mental health problems have been deprived of timely treatment,” said Nali Bajracharya, a senior public health officer at the department. “Now patients having mental health issues and seeking care at our health centres will also get mental health treatment.”Though neither the federal government agency nor the city office has data on the number of people suffering from mental health problems in the metropolis, doctors estimated that a lot of people could be suffering from various forms of mental health problems—anxiety, depression and others.Officials say that they are also planning to provide free medication to patients with mental health problems.Health workers say that many city dwellers, despite having mental health problems, do not seek treatment and instead turn to drugs and substances to cope. Due to the entrenched social stigma, fear of discrimination and other factors, many patients in Nepal do not talk about their mental health issues.The general tendency among people to conceal mental health issues due to the stigma attached to it has also forced patients to opt for substance abuse, doctors say.They say that while drugs and alcohol may provide temporary relief from stress, they are not a solution and can adversely affect mental health and well-being in the long run.“Treatment in the initial stage of mental illness helps patients achieve better results. For that, early diagnosis is crucial,” said Dr Pomawati Thapa, chief of the Non-communicable Disease and Mental Health Section at the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division. “Other local units should also follow the initiative to provide mental health screening training to health workers, including doctors.”Nepal is among the countries with highest rates of suicide, which is an extreme manifestation of a mental health problem.According to Nepal Police data, 6,993 people took their own lives in the fiscal year 2022-2023. This accounts for more than 19 deaths on average daily. Fifty-six percent of those who die by suicide are men.Doctors say that people do not attempt suicide for a single reason, but due to a complex situation arising from multiple problems.An increasing number of people are struggling with mental problems owing to the rising cost of living and the struggle to manage even their most basic needs, such as food, housing, healthcare and jobs, experts say.Whatever the cause, suicides and suicide attempts have a ripple effect, impacting families, friends, colleagues, communities and societies, doctors say.A study carried out by the Nepal Health Research Council in the past shows that about 13 percent of Nepalis suffer from some form of mental disorder. This means around one in eight Nepalis has mental health issues. Moreover, the country simply does not have enough experts to treat mental health problems, it added.Studies show the magnitude of suffering, the burden and costs for individuals, families and societies arising from mental health disorders are alarming in Nepal.“No doubt, mental health problems have been emerging as a major cause of morbidity and mortality in our country,” said Thapa. “All local governments must take initiative to address the problems. Only the federal government agencies cannot do much.”The World Health Organisation says that one in four people in the world has been affected by mental or neurological disorders at some point in their lives, and around 450 million people currently suffer from such conditions, placing mental disorders among the leading causes of ill health and disability worldwide. \nDuring the 2022 local level election, people of Kathmandu elected independent candidate Balendra Shah as their mayor for five years. Sunita Dangol of the CPN-UML secured the position of KMC deputy mayor in the same election. When they began their term, many suspected that the two—an independent mayor and his party-affiliated deputy—wouldn’t have cordial relations. But, in the last two years of their term, there has been no visible disagreement between them. They proved their sceptics wrong.Deputy Mayor Dangol kept mum when Mayor Shah accused her party chair, KP Sharma Oli, of policy corruption in the Giri Bandhu Tea Estate land scam.Moreover, Shah expressed his anger on June 3 over the government’s intervention in his plan to widen pavements in the New Road area. Deputy Prime Minister Raghubir Mahaseth of the UML leads the Ministry of Physical Infrastructure and Transport, which maintains major roads.After the ministry intervened in the municipal plan to expand the sidewalk on New Road, Shah took to social media and wrote, “Honourable KP Oli jyu, don’t hoodwink people by engineering yet another scam to hide a scam of Rs10,000 crore [Rs100 billion].”He further added, “You have reassured those who had made advance payments to buy land of Giri Bandhu Tea Estate that they would get the land within two years.” “If one looks at the policy corruption in the tea estate, it appears not a single leaf would stir without Oli’s nod,” Shah wrote.A few days prior to the incident, Mayor Shah had engaged in a heated debate with Chinkaji Maharjan, a UML member and chairman of KMC’s ward 22, over the sidewalk expansion plan.Dangol remained quiet on the issue thus far. However, at the city council meeting on Monday, which also discussed KMC's policies and programmes for the fiscal year 2024-25, she criticised Mayor Shah for his remarks.“This should be the first time the deputy mayor opposed the public behavior and statement of the mayor,” a Kathmandu ward chairperson told the Post on the condition of anonymity.Dangol had her initial plan to contest the mayor position independently but the UML gave her the deputy mayor’s ticket.Speaking during the Monday discussion, Deputy Mayor Dangol said, addressing Mayor Shah, “Your and mine voices are being heard and watched by Nepalis worldwide. Therefore, those of us who want to come to politics should think about our expression,” Dangol remarked. “We should maintain the image and dignity of the institution we represent.”She also emphasised the need to accommodate the voices of everyone in an undertaking.Though the representatives of Kathmandu Metropolitan City claim that Dangol's Monday statement was unusual, they deny any rift between the two leaders of the local government. “City council’s is an internal meeting of the KMC where various issues arise. We settle those issues internally,” Nabin Manandhar, the KMC spokesperson and ward 17 chairman from the Nepali Congress, told the Post. “Having an opinion does not necessarily mean criticism.”Rajesh Kumar Shrestha, chair of KMC ward 19, seconded Manandhar.However, local representatives of Kathmandu have been questioning Shah for his ‘lone-wolf’ manner of leading the institution.“We should develop a working relationship that welcomes everyone’s spirit,” Dangol told the council meeting. “If one thinks they are in a position and everything should be done as they say, it will only lead to trouble.”She added, “While working in a team, we definitely have a different opinion, but different opinions should be respected.”At the meeting, referring to Mayor Shah's past statements, council member Anita Karki asked him, saying, “What if the voters of Kathmandu set ablaze the Durbar where the KMC office lies?”In September last year, when the traffic police obstructed a KMC vehicle, later known to be used by his postpartum wife, Mayor Shah provocatively wrote on Facebook, threatening to burn Singha Durbar, the federal government’s central secretariat.Traffic police, under the federal government, had stopped the vehicle to check necessary documents on a Saturday.After the incident, Shah wrote on social media warning that if the government blocked KMC's vehicles again, he would set fire to Singha Durbar.Dangol said on Monday that she believed it was wrong to write on social media or make a statement inciting people to burn the Singha Durbar or the Bagh Durbar, where the KMC office is situated.Dangol, speaking at the city council meeting, also said there should be no polarisation between the representatives who were elected to develop Kathmandu. \nA police officer was found dead on the premises of the federal parliament building in Baneshwar, Kathmandu on Wednesday.According to Ekram Giri, spokesperson for the federal parliament secretariat, Ajit Gole of Dolakha committed suicide by shooting himself.The body of the victim was recovered from the parliament building’s washroom.Dinesh Mainali, spokesperson for the Kathmandu Metro Police Range, said Gole, who was on duty from 6am to 10am, was found dead at around 8 in the morning. “A constable of Nepal Police was found dead inside a toilet of the parliament building,” Mainali told the Post. “Preliminary investigation shows he was inflicted with a gunshot.”Nepal police said the investigation is underway. \nPolice on Friday arrested two people from Thimi of Bhaktapur for allegedly mining cryptocurrency.The Central Investigation Bureau took 50-year-old Biswas Gurung and Rajendra Tahamata, 25, into custody in connection with the crime, said Hobindra Bogati, spokesperson for the bureau.The duo allegedly ran mining operations from the CTEVT’s information technology lab using a server and 64 desktops, on which blockchain applications were found during a preliminary investigation. Further investigation into the matter is underway. \nAmid an economic slowdown, the banking sector is looking for a slightly loose monetary policy to boost the confidence of the financial and private sectors, including individuals. The banking sector expects favourable working capital guidelines, which will open avenues for the financial industry and traders to increase their economic activities. In this context, the Post’s Krishana Prasain caught up with Upendra Prasad Poudel, chairman of Nabil Bank, to discuss the economy and the banking sector amid Nepal’s ballooning foreign exchange reserves and slowed lending. Excerpts:The monetary policy is due soon. What are the expectations of the banking industry?Our expectations from monetary policy are high as the country’s economy is going through a challenging situation. Some people say the economy is in crisis. But I don't call it a crisis because the external sector, including key economic indicators, is doing well. The country’s economy is looking for a boost—confidence where it will be easy for everyone to work in tandem. Our economic base is small. It will not take a long time for the economy to revive. In that background, we need a loose monetary policy to address everyone's needs.A loose monetary policy aims to stimulate economic activity and reduce unemployment by lowering interest rates and increasing the money supply. Without a loose monetary policy, building the private sector confidence is difficult. Liquidity is sufficient. To increase the credit demand, there is a need to boost consumption. To increase consumption, people need to have enough cash in their hands. That demands government and private sector investments. This depends on both fiscal and monetary policies. For instance, the construction sector is facing trouble, and as a result, there is not much economic activity with the government failing to pay the contractors. When contractors are not getting money, they are not giving it to workers. So the money is not reaching the people. As a result, consumption has remained stagnant. The government is not giving subsidies to agriculture or the insurance sector. We learn that the government needs more money. The private sector no longer trusts the government’s fiscal policy. In contrast, since the banking sector is regulated and disciplined, everyone looks up to monetary policy. Naturally, the private sector has high expectations from the central bank. What kind of policies are needed to revive the economy? As I said, public consumption needs to grow. To boost consumption, there is a need to increase credit. In the past, the banking sector made aggressive lending, but the credit did not go into the real economy or the productive sector. So, the central bank and commercial banks are now worried. Even though credit has seen a growth lately, the impact is not visible. At one level, the money needs to reach everyone's hands. So monetary policy needs to encourage credit flow. There is a slowdown in the banking industry, too. Banks are not able to offer dividends. Positive developments also exist. Interest has been cut, which will reduce capital costs, ultimately increasing output and consumption.Foreign exchange reserves are at a record high. Banks’ lending has yet to improve. What does this show?People are spending less. Reduced spending means that the demand for goods and services has declined. Even though the interest rate has declined, banks struggle to boost credit. As the foreign exchange rate increases, we have the space to increase imports. Banks have liquidity and the capacity to disburse funds. Interest rates are also declining, and the environment is becoming more conducive. But the demand for loans is a must. The confidence in the system must be high for the demand for loans to grow. The International Monetary Fund also indicates that Nepal’s situation may improve in the next fiscal year, depending on the monetary policy. What is sustainable banking? Why are Nepali banks reluctant to follow it?We look at sustainable banking in a futuristic way. We work for days beyond today. We work for tomorrow's generation. We work to make resources available for tomorrow. We must work to make everything sustainable. We have to preserve nature. Banks have gone for short-term profits. That's how we have deviated from sustainability. But our banks still need to go for sustainable practices. The central bank defines the productive sector including energy as the real economy. Investing in those sectors leads to sustainability.Our system ranks banks on the basis of profit, the number of depositors or the volume of loans. In reality, though, to be number one, the parameter should be the impact the bank has on the economy, environment, and society. Knowingly or unknowingly, everyone is talking about sustainable banking. Many banks have started reporting their carbon footprints. Many banks, including Nabil, have started various schemes for agriculture. There are products for women entrepreneurship for inclusive development and migrant workers as well. The banking sector needs to be aware of responsible investment. The central bank has been reinforcing this idea from time to time. How have cooperatives issues affected banks?As the financial system is interlinked, problems in the cooperative sector have impacted the banking sector directly or indirectly. Some cooperative deposits are with banks, and the bank's money has also gone to cooperatives. Not only cooperatives but some credit to loan sharks might have been sourced from banks, too. These are serious issues that need to be tackled prudently. We sense that the problem in the cooperatives sector will shake up the banking sector one day. The banking sector is highly regulated and has the capacity to absorb any shock, though it may not make a profit as before. Regulating cooperatives is difficult now: it’s already too late. The SME sector complains that getting bank loans isn’t easy. What can be done to increase credit flow?We are the custodians of depositors and cannot lend money to anyone easily. We draw a borderline to mitigate possible risk. Lack of financial literacy is still prevailing, and we have been working to create awareness. The financial sector has become transparent, but the private sector hasn’t. The government needs to create an environment that makes businesses transparent. The banks have started taking steps to develop and scale up entrepreneurship. Such initiative needs to be taken by the government, including the local level. The growth in entrepreneurship will stop our youths from going abroad. The government needs to spend heavily on developing entrepreneurship by supporting startups. Nepal has started cross-border digital payment. How has the banking sector started preparation, especially on the operating side?Banks have made a giant leap in terms of digital payment. Certain levels of credit are being approved online. Bank accounts are opened online, and security documents are automatically generated. We have moved ahead in the information and technology systems in the banking sector. However, we are still in the infancy when it comes to the adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) in the banking sector. To make transactions with India more comprehensive, we need support from Indian regulators, especially in preventing illegal transactions. With proper regulations and support, digital payments will boom. \nThe International Monetary Fund (IMF) has warned that Nepal’s economy, still reeling from subdued domestic demand and post‑pandemic balance sheet repairs, may face an increasingly gloomy and uncertain outlook, mainly due to fragile political stability and cooperatives failure.The global lender, which provides policy advice and financing to its members to foster growth and financial stability, said Nepal’s fragile political stability could disrupt policy continuity and reform implementation. Nepal is set to elect the new prime minister next week. Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal is almost certain to fail the trust vote. This will be his fifth trust vote in a year and a half. The CPN-UML withdrew its support to the government on July 3 after it ditched its coalition with the CPN (Maoist Centre) and joined hands with the Nepali Congress to form a new government.This is the fourth time in Nepal’s political history that two major parties are forming a government without a powerful opposition, which observers say weakens democracy's effective functioning.On Tuesday, the IMF completed the fourth review under its four‑year extended credit facility, allowing Nepal to withdraw $41.3 million to help the country's economic recovery.This brings total disbursements under the extended credit facility for budget support to $247.7 million.The IMF executive board approved the extended credit facility arrangement for Nepal on January 12, 2022. The approved amount totals $371.6 million, which is 180 percent of Nepal’s special drawing rights quota (SDR) of 282.42 million.“Nepal’s economy continues to face challenges,” said the statement issued by the IMF on Thursday. It said that Nepal’s growth projected at 3 percent in the fiscal year 2023-24 remains below potential due to subdued domestic demand and post‑pandemic balance sheet repairs. The IMF has talked about Nepal’s cooperatives sector for the first time.In the statement, the IMF warned about the intensification of financial sector vulnerabilities, such as a further rise in non-performing loans. In this context, “more failures of cooperative lenders could endanger the banking system's soundness,” the IMF said.According to experts and bankers interviewed by the Post, cooperatives, which the government once embraced as one of the three pillars of the economy, are now threatening the economy.In Nepal, millions of small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are heavily involved in cooperatives, and their failure could not only damage the fragile economy, but also harm social harmony, say experts. Cooperatives are involved in sectors ranging from dairy and livestock to tailoring and retail.Recently, thousands of victims of cooperatives fraud have staged protests in various parts of the country, demanding the return of deposits embezzled by cooperative operators. Hundreds of such depositors came to Kathmandu and staged protests. The government recently signed an agreement with them, promising to solve their problems as soon as possible.“The problem in the cooperative sector will shake up the banking sector. But if there is a wise move, the banking sector can absorb the shock,” said Upendra Poudyal, president of the Confederation of Banks and Financial Institutions Nepal. He said that the regulation of cooperatives has already been delayed. “We have seen that cooperatives are being operated for personal gains. A limited number of people took the benefit.” “Now, the central bank should begin with a single threshold. Limit the number and start supervision.” As of mid-March, there are 31,450 cooperatives in Nepal, with 7.38 million members. The deposit mobilisation in cooperatives amounted to Rs478 billion, while credit mobilisation stood at Rs405 billion. They currently employ 94,000 people.In a recent interview, Kashi Raj Dahal, immediate past chairman of the Crisis-ridden Cooperatives Management Committee, a government agency, told the Post that globally, most cooperatives work in productive sectors like food production, dairy, fruits and other agricultural activities. “But in Nepal, around 25,000 cooperatives are involved only in financial activities, mainly collecting deposits and issuing loans. Such cooperatives are now in crisis. Over 15,000 are registered to collect deposits. Even others registered as multi-purpose cooperatives primarily engage in savings and credits. Around 500 cooperatives are currently in trouble.”The Dahal-led government has promised the return of at least Rs500,000 to each depositor by recovering it from the directors' assets. Yet doubts persist about whether depositors will get back their money. Some economists have warned about potential mass protests if the cooperatives issue is not taken seriously.The IMF has also warned that the failure to raise the execution rate of large-scale projects would deprive the economy of much-needed stimulus and weigh on growth. On the pessimistic side, the IMF said that economic activity is expected to increase, reaching 4.9 percent in 2024-25, supported by more robust domestic demand. The statement reads that the cautiously accommodative monetary policy stance, the planned increase in capital expenditures in the 2024-25 budget, additional hydropower generation, and a continued rise in tourist arrivals are expected to boost domestic demand and growth. Inflation is expected to remain within the Nepal Rastra Bank’s (NRB) target ceiling of 5.5 percent.“Nepal has made important strides on its economic reform agenda. Decisive actions in monetary policy, bank regulation and rolling off Covid support policies played a major role in overcoming urgent balance of payments pressure in 2021-22,” said Bo Li, deputy managing director of IMF. “Reserves continue to rise without the need to use distortive import restrictions. Despite revenue shortfalls, fiscal discipline was maintained in 2022-23 and 2023-24. Bank supervision and regulation have improved by rolling out new supervisory information systems. Nepal’s medium-term outlook remains favourable as strategic investments in infrastructure, especially in the energy sector, are expected to support potential growth.”The IMF said that strengthening public investment management would support the needed boost to capital spending. Enhancing fiscal transparency will help contain fiscal risks and strengthen medium-term fiscal sustainability.“As monetary policy transmission is still weak in a context of balance sheet repair, a cautious and data-dependent monetary policy remains appropriate to preserve price and external stability,” the IMF said.  \nKot Ghar, once considered the seat of powerful Malla kings of Galkot, a pretty kingdom in the confederation of 24 states known as Chaubisi Rajya, has been restored and preserved to draw tourists.The Kot Ghar means a house where weapons are placed or stored. The town of Galkot once served as the fortress of the hilly kingdom ruled by the Mallas. The historical palace, which has been renovated, offers a reason to visit Galkot.Before the Panchayat era, Galkot served as Baglung's headquarters. Without the administrative offices, the locals seek to make Galkot the tourism headquarters of Baglung.According to history, Jitari Malla, the elder son of King Narayan Malla of Parbat, established Galkot Rajya in 1631 BS.A stone inscription states that Kot Ghar was constructed in 1661 BS. Galkot was free until Jagat Pratap Malla's rule in 1844 BS. The local government has been trying to preserve the historical artefacts to showcase to the visitors. The ancient palace of Galkot was in dire straits because of the lack of conservation.The Shreemeher Gana barracks of the Nepal Army and Galkot municipality have jointly renovated the almost-collapsed Kot Ghar.Professor Din Bahadur Thapa, a historian, said that the state also produced rice during the 10th generation of kings 213 years ago. After that, until 2015 BS, the kings of Galkot remained rulers. After the last king, Bharat Bam Malla, was elected to parliament in the 2015 BS general election, Raja Rajouta stepped down. There is a history of Bharat Bam submitting a proposal to remove Raja Rajauta from the House of Representatives.Thapa's research mentions that the state of Galkot extended to Kathekhola in the east, Pandavakhani in the west, Rum in Myagdi in the north, and Musikot in Gulmi in the south. After the kingdom was taken away, Jagat Pratap Bam Malla moved the palace to Shraddhakhet. The last king, Bharat Bam, built a palace in Harichor Bazar in 1990 BS. The construction started in 1978 BS.Even until 2019 BS, the central administrative units of Baglung were in Galkot. Later, they were shifted to Baglung Bazaar. The Kot Ghar conservation and tourism promotion programme was started five years ago to reflect this legacy. Bir Jung Bhandari, former ward chairman of Galkot Municipality, had started some of the works.Bharat Sharma Gaire, mayor of the municipality, said that the historic city planning and the work to preserve the history had been completed with the help of the Nepal Army.Cannoning infrastructure has also been built at Sahasradhara waterfall near Kot Ghar. Festivals are organised during the Dashain and Chaite Dashain. Hundreds of pilgrims tour these religious sites annually.Locals conduct regular worship. A hundred houses in Kotmaidan village offer worship by taking ownership. It is listed in the city pride project.The weapons in Kot Ghar have been kept separately by making a new home. The doors and windows of Kot Ghar have been modelled on the Bhaktapur craft. On the way to Kot Ghar, a barbed wire fence and railing have been set up.Drainage and culverts have been constructed in some road stretches that reach Kot Ghar from the mid-hill highway. The municipality has been investing yearly to pave the road to Kot Ghar. The location is important from the tourism perspective.Galkot Valley, Ghumte hill, Daram River, and Tara River can be viewed from Kot Ghar. Kalika temple, near Kot Ghar, has also been maintained.Nearly 100 ropanies have been protected through barbed wire fences. The number of tourists visiting Kot Ghar has recently increased with the construction of drinking water taps and resting areas.The association of the former army conducted a district-level annual general meeting in the Kot Ghar area.It is presumed that the state was named Galkot, derived from ‘Golo Kot’, the way the Kot Ghar was built.Kot Ghar, located in Galkot Municipality-3, was the first seat of the kings. Though the king shifted to Harichaur through Shraddakhet, the weapons were kept in Kot Ghar and Kalika temple. Other structures were also built around Kot Ghar. Gaire said the places of historical importance were protected. A six-kilometre road has been built from the mid-hill highway to Kot Ghar.The road to Kot Ghar from the highway was maintained and paved, said Pham Bahadur Khatri, the ward chairman. He said that around Rs1.5 million was spent to renovate Kot Ghar, and the Nepal Army provided Rs900,000 and the human resources. \nIn a bid to support midwives and other healthcare personnel in ensuring safer births in low-resource settings, the Ministry of Health and Population has launched a “safe delivery app”.Officials hope that the mobile application will complement and enhance the ongoing capacity-building of health workers and help in reducing maternal and newborn deaths.“The Safe Delivery App provides up-to-date lifesaving procedures and practical guidance in the local language,” said Dr Bibek Kumar Lal, director of the Family Welfare Division under the Department of Health Services, at the launch of the Nepali version of the Safe Delivery App. “It aims to improve the quality of emergency obstetric and newborn care, and the main users will be our frontline health workers, especially nurses and midwives.”Officials at the division said that the government has collaborated with the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) and the Maternity Foundation (MF) to launch the Nepali version of the widely used digital health tool.Globally, every two minutes, a woman dies. In Nepal, two women die every day due to pregnancy-related complications—most of which are preventable, said Won Young Hong, a UNFPA representative in Nepal. “These are staggering numbers. UNFPA is pleased to work with the concerned stakeholders to localise this digital application so healthcare workers across Nepal can use it.”The Safe Delivery App is an evidence-based learning and training tool designed to support midwives, nurses, and other healthcare professionals to assist during births and to manage the most common complications. Among other features, it contains the latest clinical guidelines, animated instruction videos, descriptions of practical procedures, and action cards. It is free, and once downloaded on a smartphone or a tablet, it works offline, making it possible to be used even in the most remote areas. To date, more than 435,000 healthcare professionals across more than 70 countries have been reached through the Safe Delivery App and the accompanying programme worldwide, with Nepal being the latest country to introduce the App. “We will work with provincial governments and development partners to quickly roll out the App throughout Nepal,” said Lal.Nepal cut the maternal mortality rate from 539 per 100,000 births in 1996 to 239 per 100,000 births in 2016—for which the country even received a Millennium Award. According to the National Statistics Office report, the country has further reduced the number of deaths to 151 per 100,000 births in 2021. Maternal health experts, however, say that even if the country has made good progress in reducing maternal deaths, the current maternal mortality ratio is more than double the Sustainable Development Goals target, which is 70 maternal deaths per 100,000 live births by 2030.Neonatal deaths have not declined between 2016 and 2022, according to the Nepal Demographic and Health Survey-2022 carried out by the Ministry of Health and Population.The government’s target for the Sustainable Development Goals was to reduce neonatal mortality to 16 deaths per 1,000 live births by 2022 and 12 in every 1,000 live births by 2030.The SDGs, a follow-up on the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), aim to end poverty, hunger, and all forms of inequality worldwide by 2030, and Nepal has committed to meeting the goals.The health ministry has been taking several measures to reduce maternal and neonatal deaths, including installing an underfloor heating system at birthing centres, setting up special newborn care units, training doctors, nurses, and paramedics in the district hospitals and distributing non-pneumatic anti-shock garments to prevent maternal deaths from excessive bleeding.Besides, the ministry provides free service and travel allowances for those opting for institutional delivery and antenatal visits. It also distributes misoprostol, a medication used to treat postpartum bleeding in new mothers, through female community health volunteers. \nAs heavy monsoon rains cause chaos across the country, dengue cases are surging in several districts, including Kathmandu.According to the Health Office Kathmandu, around 18 people are infected with the dengue virus every day. Officials, however, admit that this number could be just the tip of the iceberg, as the office gets reports only from 18 health facilities.“Yes, the number of people infected with the dengue virus could be several times higher than suggested by the reports we are getting every day,” said Dr Arjun Sapkota, chief of the Health Office, Kathmandu. “We are working to make daily reporting of dengue cases mandatory for private health facilities as well.”Dengue is a viral disease transmitted by female Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes. The same vectors also transmit chikungunya, yellow fever, and Zika virus, according to the World Health Organisation.According to data provided by the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division, at least 1,432 people from 73 districts have been infected with the virus since January this year. Among the 73 districts that reported dengue outbreaks, Kathmandu has the highest number of cases with 159, followed by Jhapa with 120, Chitwan 83, Makawanpur 65, Tanahun and Doti 49 cases each, and Okhaldhunga and Sindhupalchowk 46 each.Sapkota informed that his office has sensitised the local bodies about the looming risk of a massive dengue outbreak in the coming days.“Mandatory reporting of dengue cases every day is among the preventive measures through which we can identify dengue hotspots,” said Sapkota. “This will help health workers target such measures in particular areas. Additionally, starting this week, we are resuming the “10 minutes at 10 am” initiative every Friday, during which mosquito breeding grounds will be destroyed.”Officials informed that several local units, including the Kathmandu Metropolitan City, have already started preventive measures against dengue. Dengue symptoms include mild to high fever, severe muscle pain, rashes, severe headache, and pain in the eyes. Patients with these symptoms are advised to seek immediate treatment. While there is no specific cure for the disease, early detection and proper medical care can prevent death.Doctors say many people infected with dengue show mild symptoms and can be treated with paracetamol at home.Nepal reported its first dengue case in a foreigner in 2004 in the Chitwan district. Since then, an increasing number of dengue infections, including major outbreaks, have been reported from many districts. Last year, at least 20 persons died, and more than 52,000 were infected by the virus, which had spread to all 77 districts.In 2022, a total of 88 people died, and over 54,000 were infected by the virus across the country. During that period, hospitals in the Kathmandu Valley were overwhelmed with dengue patients, and pharmacies ran out of paracetamol, the most widely used medicine to treat fever.In 2019, the disease killed at least six people and more than 16,000 were hospitalised across the country. The virus had spread to 68 districts at the time.Though the post-monsoon period is considered the dengue epidemic season, the deadly disease has already become endemic in Nepal, as outbreaks are reported every month, including in the winter months.According to health workers, storage places for scrap materials, discarded cups, plastic material tossed in open spaces, and unused lands will be potential hotspots for the dengue virus in the coming days. Health workers have warned the owners of these sites that action will be taken if mosquito larvae are found there.Dengue-transmitting mosquitoes breed in clean water and bite people in daylight. Uncovered water tanks and discarded objects, such as plastic cups and bottles, could be breeding grounds for these mosquitoes. \nWith monsoon havoc sweeping across the country, the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division has urged health workers to avoid taking leave during the season.Officials have warned that health facilities could be overwhelmed by patients in the coming days as outbreaks of waterborne and vector-borne diseases are expected, as floodwaters have contaminated most of the drinking water sources.“We have requested the provincial and local health authorities not to grant leave to health workers during the monsoon season,” said Dr Yadu Chandra Ghimire, director of the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division. “Health agencies have been cautioned about the looming risk of outbreaks of waterborne and vector-borne diseases in the coming days.”Torrential rainfall started Friday wreaking havoc in various places across the country. At least 14 people have died in disaster-related incidents—nine in landslides and five in floods—since Friday, according to the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Authority. Officials said 18 others have been injured, and four people are missing. Since the monsoon entered the country on June 10, at least 43 people have died in landslides and flood-related incidents. Lightning strikes killed as many as 19 people during this period.The monsoon season in Nepal is a time of epidemics during which thousands of people across the country become infected with water-borne and vector-borne diseases.The persistent rainfall that started on Friday not only destroyed houses and inundated settlements but also contaminated drinking water sources.Health officials warned that health facilities could witness an uptick in the number of viral fever cases, and waterborne diseases—diarrhoea, dysentery, food poisoning, and snake bites—in the coming days.“We have also requested central hospitals and medical colleges to be prepared for help during disease outbreaks,” said Ghimire. “As we don’t have enough doctors and health workers to deploy to control the outbreaks, we have to seek help from big hospitals and medical colleges.”Officials at the Ministry of Health and Population said that they have been raising awareness through all available means to inform people of the risks. “Essential medicines have been stockpiled, health workers have been asked to be ready for deployment to affected areas, anti-snake venom has been supplied to health facilities,” said Dr Prakash Budhathoki, spokesperson at the Health Ministry. “As of Sunday evening, no outbreaks have been reported.”According to health experts, sources of drinking water generally become contaminated in disaster-hit areas, and people displaced by natural disasters become highly vulnerable to infections with waterborne and vector-borne diseases. Every year, thousands of people get infected with vector-borne diseases such as dengue, kala-azar, malaria, and scrub typhus during this period. Last year, at least 20 persons died, and more than 52,000 were infected by the virus, which had spread to all 77 districts. According to data provided by the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division, at least 1,432 people from 73 districts have been infected with the dengue virus since January this year. Among the 73 districts that reported dengue outbreaks, Kathmandu has the highest number of cases: 159. Public health experts say reported cases could be just the tip of the iceberg, as around 80 percent of those infected are asymptomatic. Likewise, snakebite incidents and resulting deaths are also common during the season, but the phenomenon, which experts dub “a lurking invisible crisis”, remains grossly neglected. “Incidents of snakebites have started to surge over the last few weeks,” said Dr Rajiv Jha, director at Provincial Health Directorate of Madhesh Province. “Along with the surge in waterborne and vector-borne diseases in the coming days, we have anticipated a rise in snakebite cases.”Doctors say the only ways to prevent deaths from waterborne diseases, including diarrhoea, are to raise awareness and ensure safe drinking water.They say a combination of careful surveys, ensuring safe drinking water, maintaining sanitation and hygiene, social mobilisation and treatment are required to contain the spread of the diarrhoeal infection. \nWith the onset of the rainy season, the incidents of snakebite are on the rise in western Tarai districts.Snakebite treatment centres and hospitals in Kanchanpur and Kailali districts of Sudurpaschim province are now crowded with snakebite patients. Treatment of the snakebite patients, according to health workers, is quite challenging as patients are often brought to the health facilities at the last minute.As many as 60 snakebite patients visited the Snakebite Treatment Centre set up by Nepal Army at Arjuni of Shuklaphanta National Park within the past three weeks. “Over the past one week three to four snakebite patients have been visiting the centre on a daily basis,” said Ratan Bohora, a paramedic at the Arjuni-based Snakebite Treatment Centre. The local residents have hugely benefited after the Nepali Army and the local community jointly established the snakebite treatment centre at Arjuni in 2014. The centre, however, has to refer the patients with serious health conditions to other well facilitated hospitals due to the lack of an intensive care unit (ICU) and ventilator. “Two patients who were bitten by poisonous snakes were referred to Mahakali Provincial Hospital in Mahendranagar this year. We have no alternative but to send serious cases of snakebite to other hospitals due to the lack of the ICU and ventilator facilities,” said Bohora. The centre also does not even have a monitor to track a patient's vital signs such as blood pressure, heart rate and oxygen levels. The flow of the patients is increasing, but the centre only has two paramedics to provide treatment.Incidents of snakebite and resulting deaths are common in Nepal, but the issue still remains grossly neglected as what experts call a lurking ‘invisible crisis’. Each year, around 2,700 people, mostly children and women from Nepal’s Tarai region, die of snakebites, according to a March 2022 report.Most snakebite incidents occur when farmers are transplanting paddy fields or children are playing outdoors. Health workers say that the snakes that live in water are generally less poisonous. “The cases that are most serious occurred at night, often inside houses. Such patients should be taken to hospital immediately,” said Bohora. According to him, people living in thatched-roof houses are especially vulnerable to snakebite, because snakes often enter such homes in search of rats.Nepal is home to around 17 highly venomous snakes. Each year, the country sees about 20,000 to 40,000 cases of snakebite. The numbers could be higher, as many cases of snakebite go unreported, health workers say.Another health challenge in rural Nepal is the superstitious belief in visiting shamans instead of seeking treatment at medical facilities for snakebite. Experts say awareness drives should be launched to educate people that the snakebite patients should be taken to the hospital at the earliest. They recommend promoting cleanliness around homes, preventing children from playing in bushy areas, avoiding nightime walks, and using torchlight while walking in the dark.“Treatment of snakebite patients is possible if they are taken to health facilities on time. Patients are often brought to the hospital only after their condition has worsened, resulting in serious consequences,” said Dr Arjun Bhatta, medical superintendent at Mahakali Provincial Hospital. According to him, 10 snakebite patients with serious health conditions visited the hospital in the past three weeks. “They returned home after treatment,” said Bhatta. \nI can vividly remember my first encounter with baking when I was 10 years old. We had just moved to our new home and got a cable connection. The cable opened a world of possibilities, as it gave me access to various contents.This was back in the late 2000s when YouTube would take hours to load, taunting us with its buffering screen. I was particularly drawn to travel and lifestyle channels, mainly TLC, Fox Life, and Food Network, which kept me informed about different foods and cultures. I don’t know why, but I was always drawn to desserts. It was fascinating to see how these miraculous treats made people smile at the end of the meal.Growing up in Nepal, I noticed that baking wasn't very common. While some families did have ovens, they were mostly multifunctional ones used primarily for heating food.I also noticed that most of our desserts didn't require an oven, as they could be made on a stovetop. So, you can imagine my excitement when my mom decided to buy an oven during one of her festive shopping sprees.I could finally feel the joy these channels portrayed. (I blame food writer Nigella Lawson for getting me hooked on a domestic lifestyle.) Then, one day, after watching one of the cooking episodes on television, I finally mustered enough strength and decided to bake something. I distinctly remember wanting to make a chocolate cake for myself after watching one of Rachel Allen’s bake series. I watched all the ingredients used in that recipe and scurried across my pantry, only to realise I didn’t have half of the stuff she mentioned. I then decided to improvise the recipe (a big mistake). I randomly combined the ingredients that I had in a mixing bowl and chucked the batter into my oven, hoping for a magical cake to pop out an hour later.After I saw the result an hour later, I was mortified. The cake was stuck in the pan, refusing to come out, and it was as dense as fudge. I convinced myself that the taste was what mattered most, but when I served a slice to my brother, he made a face of utter disgust.That was the day I realised that baking soda was not the same as baking powder.After this incident, I researched baking and found out it was technical. This was a blessing in disguise for me, as I loved science, and I started to view baking as a science experiment. I then reflected and evaluated how to perfect one's baking skills.I analysed my errors and noted down all the steps I did every time I baked. Home baking is a passion for many. The idea of turning a few simple ingredients into a delicious masterpiece is as enchanting as it sounds.Yet, for many of us, this seemingly magical process can often turn into a series of unfortunate events, leading to crumbled dreams and deflated ambitions. Dense cakes, burnt crusts, rock-hard cookies and unrisen bread, if you are an amateur baker, then you have seen it all. But why do these mishaps happen so often? And most importantly how do we overcome them?From my experience, behind every successful bake lies a series of challenges and mishaps that test even the most dedicated bakers. Baking has its own set of rules that you need to follow to get that scrumptious treat every time. So, to transform a recipe into an actual dish that will impress your friends and family, I am sharing with you some of the tips and tricks I learned from my tumultuous journey as a home baker.First things first, we have to look into the prime appliance that we are working with. Commercial ovens are of two types: one that runs on gas and the other that runs on electricity. We have to look at the oven present at our home and consider its pros and cons. The main benefits of a gas oven are its size and temperature control. One can quickly change the temperature just by twisting the knob, and it preheats much more quickly than an electric one. However, they are known to have uneven temperatures at times and release more humidity, making it harder to properly crisp or brown food. This can result in burnt edges and cold or hot spots. An electric oven, on the other hand, provides more even and consistent temperatures and doesn’t release as much moisture in the air.This dry oven environment makes it easier to brown your items, making it great for baking bread. However, while the dry oven results in more even cooking, you also run the risk of drying out cakes and other baked goods.Also, many people forget to preheat the oven before baking, which is crucial for maintaining an even temperature throughout the baking process. When baking cakes and bread, I like to place a small tray of water at the bottom of the oven to provide moisture and prevent the baked goods from drying out.An oven thermometer can be a baker's best friend, providing a true reading and ensuring your creations bake evenly. I also like rotating the pan midway while baking, as it allows for an even distribution of heat.The next thing people mess up on is measuring and the specificity of ingredients in a recipe. Our moms made our food with their instinct; it is something that they learned along the way, but when you are baking, you cannot instinctively add or omit a few steps.I think that is why we initially had problems with baking. In a culture where cooking comes instinctually, baking challenges us, to be precise. A gram of more or less of any ingredient can drastically alter the outcome. Different methods of measuring flour can yield different results.Every component in baking serves a distinct purpose and function. Flour offers structure, sugar adds sweetness and moisture, eggs bind things together, and butter enhances taste and texture. However, not all ingredients are created equally. For example, using salted butter instead of unsalted might change the taste profile of your meal.Similarly, different flours have varying protein concentrations, which affect the texture of baked goods. The type of sugar used also makes a difference. Granulated sugar, brown sugar, powdered sugar, and speciality sugars like turbinado or muscovado each add unique flavours to a bake.Understanding these nuances and how they interact is critical for getting the intended outcomes. Accurate measurement tools and techniques are essential, but mastering them can be a steep learning curve. So, I would recommend investing in a kitchen scale that allows for more accurate measurements by weight rather than volume.Moving on, leavening agents such as baking soda, baking powder, and yeast are required to make baked goods rise. However, they can also cause confusion and errors. Baking soda needs an acidic component to activate, but baking powder has both an acid and a base, making it self-activating.Using the wrong type of flour or sugar, or using them in incorrect proportions, can result in flat, overly raised, or collapsed cakes. Yeast, being a living organism, presents its challenges.The water temperature must be just right—not too hot to kill the yeast, nor too cold to inhibit its activity. Proofing times and conditions also need to be carefully managed to achieve the perfect rise.Bakers should also be careful about the way they mix ingredients. The method of mixing ingredients can significantly impact the final product. Over-mixing can develop too much gluten in cakes and pastries, leading to tough textures.Under-mixing can leave pockets of unincorporated ingredients, resulting in uneven bakes. Techniques like folding, creaming, and whipping each serve specific purposes and must be executed with care.Finally, home bakers must understand the importance of timing and patience in baking. Even a minute or two can make the difference between perfectly baked cookies and burnt edges.Recipes often provide a range for baking times, but factors like oven hot spots, pan material, and altitude can affect these times. It’s crucial to keep a close eye on your bakes and rely on visual and tactile cues, such as a cake pulling away from the sides of the pan or a toothpick coming out clean, to determine doneness.Baking is also an exercise in patience, a virtue not everyone possesses. Doughs need time to rest and rise, flavours need time to meld, and baked goods need time to cool before they can be enjoyed.Impatience can lead to underbaked centres, crumbling slices, and a general sense of frustration. Cultivating patience is as important as mastering any technique in the baker’s repertoire.Home baking is a journey full of ups and downs, but it comes with great rewards. The obstacles encountered teach valuable lessons in patience, precision, and perseverance.The satisfaction of success, the freedom to create, and the therapeutic benefits make the endeavour meaningful. Whether baking for oneself, loved ones, or as an artistic outlet, the journey is as fulfilling as the result. Embrace the flour-dusted countertops, occasional setbacks, and the joys of home bakingFor a beginner-friendly recipe that involves mixing ingredients and delivers amazing results, try my recipe for fudgy, nutty brownies that I call ‘Bliss Brownies’.Bliss Brownies150g unsalted butter plus extra for the tin150g chopped dark chocolate200g caster sugar½ tsp baking powder2 eggs80g cocoa powder150g plain flour70g mixture of nuts (walnuts and almonds)60g blended papayaMix all the ingredients (except the dark chocolate and nuts) in a blender or a food processor and blitz till you get a smooth paste.Fold the chocolate and the nuts into the brownie batter, making sure that the pieces are evenly mixed in.Grease a loaf pan with soft butter and dust with cocoa powder. Pour the batter into the loaf pan.Bake in a preheated oven at 170c for 40 minutes and let it cool in the oven for an hour. Enjoy with a cup of coffee or, as I like it, a scoop of vanilla ice cream. \nIn a world where acceptance and safety often seem difficult to attain, many queer individuals also struggle to find a safe space to express themselves. They have to hide their true self and face relentless judgement when going to public places like cafes and restaurants.This is the reality for countless LGBTQIA+ individuals. The need for a safe space for this community is not just a desire but a necessity—a space where one can be themselves. This struggle for safety and acceptance can be traced to crucial historical moments, such as the Stonewall Riots of 1969 in New York City.The Stonewall Inn was more than a bar; it was a refuge for the queer community. When police raided the bar, the community fought back. This series of violent confrontations, which began in the early hours of June 28, 1969, between police and gay rights activists, marked the beginning of the modern LGBTQIA+ rights movement. The spirit of Stonewall, the fight for dignity and the right to exist openly lives on in places like Inclusive Galaxy Restaurant in Kathmandu. Inclusive Galaxy beyond a restaurant is an ‘oasis’ for the queer community and beyond.Founded by Bishwaraj Adhikari, Mr Gay Handsome Nepal 2013, a human rights defender, the restaurant proves the power of safe spaces. It’s a place where the community can unite, free from the prejudice and hostility that often permeate their everyday lives.After years of working in the human rights sector, Adhikari and his partner developed the idea for Inclusive Galaxy. What began as a small cafe gradually evolved into a full-fledged restaurant, driven by the growing demand and support from the community.“In developed countries with strong LGBTQIA+ movements, you can find community areas like gay villages. These are created as safe spaces for people whose families and communities have excluded them. They also support new business ideas and pink tourism. I hope to see pink tourism develop in Nepal someday,” says Adhikari. His vision for Inclusive Galaxy goes beyond just being a restaurant. He aims to promote financial independence and empowerment within the queer community.Since its inception in February 2019, Inclusive Galaxy has become a key spot for many in Lazimpat, a relatively queer-friendly area in Kathmandu. The location is essential because the first LGBTQIA+ movement in Nepal started in 2001 through the Blue Diamond Society.Inclusive Galaxy, true to its name, welcomes everyone—queer and non-queer alike—to share a comfortable space. His vision was clear: to create a space where people of all genders and sexual identities could come together without fear of exclusion.“I didn’t want to make it exclusively for queer people because that would be excluding ourselves from society. Different groups need to live together and understand each other,” Adhikari explains.In the early days, the cafe attracted both queer and non-queer customers. However, when some of the residents learned about Adhikari’s identity and the nature of the clientele, there was a brief period of hesitation. “At first, I didn’t understand what was happening, but then I realised my identity was an issue for a few people. I believe people should be judged by others by their character, not by their gender or sexuality. Over time, as residents saw that we operated like any other cafe, they became more comfortable,” Adhikari reflects.Adhikari started Inclusive Galaxy to give queer individuals a place to be proud of themselves, counteracting the self-doubt and insecurity that hiding one’s identity can cause. This turned the cafe very quickly into a community hub. The journey was not without challenges, though. It was difficult to hire staff and cooks from the LGBTQIA+ community, and soon after the restaurant opened, the COVID pandemic made things even harder.Despite these difficulties, the doors of Inclusive Galaxy remained open. During the pandemic, many queer individuals, who were abandoned by their families or afraid to return home, found comfort at Inclusive Galaxy.Since many couldn’t afford to pay for meals, the restaurant provided free food from its resources. As the number of people needing meals grew to 20-30 daily, Adhikari started raising funds within the community.“During my time as an activist, many people came here not only for food but also to see an organisation where the queer community supports one another,” Adhikari says.“The time during COVID was difficult, but it brought me closer to the community.”Four years after its inception, the restaurant has garnered a loyal following. Sarosy Neupane, Miss Pink Nepal 2024 first runner-up, describes Inclusive Galaxy as her second home. She moved to Kathmandu to study in 2022. Being distant from her family, she started visiting Galaxy for meals that reminded her of home-cooked food. Over time, she grew attached to the café because of its welcoming atmosphere.“It’s heartwarming to see people from our community and different walks of life here. The founders even invite us to festivals like ‘Dahi Chiura Khane din,’” she shares.Neupane visits the cafe regularly and sometimes stays until 3 am, engrossed in conversations. “I hope more spaces like this can open in the future. If, unfortunately, this place were to close someday, I don’t think we’d have any other place to turn to,” she adds.Muna Chhetri, a trans woman who has been a loyal customer for three years, shares, “This is my safe space where I can truly be myself. I always feel judged in other restaurants, but that fear doesn’t exist here. It’s where even those who aren’t accepted at home can feel accepted.”Sahara Khadka Chhetri, owner of Pink Tiffany, Kathmandu’s first openly LGBTIQIA+ friendly restaurant and bar, frequently visits after managing the bar, appreciating the convenience of not cooking at home.She notes very few places like this cater to our community, and some even had to close during COVID. “As an entrepreneur, I know that sustaining these spaces is a challenge. But as more spaces like these open, they will make the way for a more inclusive and compassionate society.”The welcoming atmosphere at Inclusive Galaxy has also had a surprising effect on non-queer patrons. Samriddha Jung Rana, a twenty-year-old neighbour who identifies as straight, often visits the café and appreciates the importance of such spaces.“Previously, I didn’t know much about the queer community and didn’t care much. But now, coming into this café, I’ve been interested in their rights and issues. I’ve realised that we’re not so different after all. We are all human,” he remarks.The ventures like Inclusive Galaxy and Pink Tiffany have inspired hope for collaborative businesses between queer and non-queer groups. The recent initiative by the Nepal Tourism Board promoting Pink Tourism in April 2024 is a positive step. Still, Adhikari believes that more support is needed from the government and the private sector.Despite the progress, challenges remain. However, Adhikari remains optimistic about the future. He is working on plans to develop the restaurant into a homestay program in the future.“Like how different planets, asteroids, and stars make up a beautiful galaxy, people from all walks of life and identities make a beautiful society. I am happy that we are assimilating together in this space. We are not so different; we are all different and similar simultaneously,” he says. \nAditya Mishra is a Nepali chef and entrepreneur based in New York. Passionate about elevating Nepali cuisine globally, Mishra sharpened his culinary skills while staging at various Michelin-starred restaurants in the city during his time at culinary school. A recipient of the James Beard Foundation National Scholars Scholarship in 2023, Mishra’s early experiences inspired him to establish his own supper club, ‘The Sewing Tin’, alongside co-founder Akhil Upad.In an interview with Post’s Aarati Ray, Mishra discusses his restaurant in New York, serving Nepali cuisines there and the recipe for his signature dish.How did your cooking journey start in New York?At 14, I told my parents I wanted to be a chef, but they preferred I pursue a stable career like engineering, as many Nepali families do. So, I left for Louisiana in 2019 to study engineering.But, cooking never left my heart so, after a year, I left engineering college and moved to New York City. It’s been three and a half years and my parents only learned about it later. When my mom visited me in NYC and saw my dedication to cooking, she saw my passion and supported my decision.What sparked your interest in cooking from a young age?As a child, I was drawn to cooking shows on TLC. The glamour of cooking, eating, travelling and the prosperity of famous chefs was fascinating.Around age 16, I discovered Chef Anthony Bourdain’s groundbreaking book, ‘Kitchen Confidential’, which shed light on the reality of the culinary industry. I learned how he became a cultural icon in NYC, reshaping perceptions of chefs.I was also fascinated by chefs like Marco Pierre White, who was a mentor to Gordon Ramsay. Their stories of achieving fame while maintaining discipline intrigued me. But, as I grew older and entered the culinary world, I realised it was far from glamorous—it involved dedication and I am glad I persevered.How did the idea for The Sewing Tin originate?The concept of ‘The Sewing Tin’ came when I realised the stark contrast between the romanticised view of kitchen work and its harsh reality. Witnessing the struggles of many kitchen staff—economic hardships, immigration challenges and language barriers—I had to rediscover my love for cooking.During my internship at ‘Junoon’ restaurant, I met my co-founder, Akhil Upad, who shared my culinary enthusiasm despite his preparations for medical college. Together, we wanted to create a dining experience that was more personal and communal, offering fine dining with a sense of community.We wanted our food to tell stories, so we named our restaurant ‘The Sewing Tin’ inspired by the immigrant experience in NYC. When immigrants opened cookie boxes as kids, they often found sewing supplies instead of food.‘The Sewing Tin’ is like opening a cookie box and finding sewing supplies—something uniquely desi, or South Asian. How do you promote Nepali cuisine in New York City through The Sewing Tin?My partner is from Atlanta with Indian roots, while I come from Nepal, so our menu celebrates and reflects both cultures and heritage.We represent our respective cultures authentically. For example, we have a dish inspired by Newari cuisine called kachaila, similar to French Tartar. We present it as Tartar to make it accessible to our customers but infuse it with Nepali flavours, telling stories about its origins and giving diners a taste of my homeland.What do you think of the prospects of Nepali cuisine abroad?I’m on a mission to share Nepali food worldwide. I have served up dishes like chatamari and lamb sekuwa in my restaurant. But I’m still learning and want to explore more of Nepal’s cuisines. My big dream? To make Nepali cuisine reach more places because it’s got something special that can wow taste buds everywhere.How do you see the changes in restaurants in Nepal?The restaurant industry has deep roots in community and bringing people together, dating back centuries. While this core idea remains, modern restaurants have evolved, making changes to adapt to the times.Yet, in Nepal, despite the growing number of restaurants, many lack uniqueness and storytelling, focusing more on making money than fostering a sense of community.I’ve noticed a troubling trend of rising prices, especially for beloved dishes like momos, which makes people question if they're getting value for their money. It seems like profits are taking precedence over creating genuine, authentic culinary experiences.The industry is starting to lose the creativity and passion that once made it special. It might be time for chefs to shake things up, challenge the norm and bring fresh ideas to the table, revitalising the culinary scene with renewed energy and creativity.What challenges have you faced in New York as an outsider?Living in a bustling city like New York as an outsider has its challenges. But, this city is also full of opportunities for those who are passionate. If you stay true to your culture and want to share your story, opportunities are waiting for you.Even though it can be daunting because of the tough competition, the city appreciates determination and expertise. When I started my journey here, all I wanted to do was cook, eat and share the story of Nepal and its diverse cultures. Instead of focusing on the difficulties, I embraced the chance to follow my passion.What do you think about the criticism of blending Nepali food with modern culinary styles?Chefs care about their food—it’s like they’re sharing a story. They’ve put in a lot of effort to become skilled, so let them be creative. It’s okay to give helpful advice but don’t be mean just to criticise. Chefs shouldn’t also just copy what’s popular, they should cook what they truly love. That’s what makes food special and meaningful.Mishra’s signature dish:Confit Duck Chatamari A traditional Nepali delicacy with French influence.Ingredients:Duck (Legs and breast)Rice (soaked overnight)MayonnaiseWhole spices (cloves, cinnamon, cardamom, bay leaf)Red onionGarlicGingerMula ko achar (Fermented radish)ScallionsLemon juiceNepali pepperVinegarSaltSugarProcedure:For the Duck:Season duck with salt and pepper.Cook in a covered pan with whole spices, garlic, and ginger at low heat for 2 hours on a stove (270 degrees in the oven)Increase heat to crisp up the skin (approximately 15 minutes).Shred the duck meat.Confit Garlic Aioli:Mash cooked garlic and ginger and mix with mayonnaise, lemon juice, Nepali pepper and fermented radishes.Pickled Onions:Slice onions and cook in a mixture of vinegar, water, salt, sugar, and whole spices until softened (about 10 minutes).For the chatamari:Blend soaked rice to make a batter, let it ferment for 6 hours, and adjust consistency with water.Assembling:Cook chatamari batter in duck fat for 4 minutes.Top with shredded duck, aioli, pickled onions and scallions.Serve \nCeleus Baral exudes a serene aura when you meet her, and when she tells you she bakes, it makes sense. Even during a brief encounter, you can tell she has the patience needed to be a baker.“You can eyeball cooking, but baking is chemistry. You have to be meticulous. You cannot rush it, or it does not turn out as expected,” says the 21-year-old environment science student. She also runs the online baking shop Bakeleus. Recently, she has also started selling her baked goods beyond her online shop, with her first stall appearing at The Yellow House’s Night Market. Bakeleus’s menu lists a variety of offerings, including jams, granola, tarts, cakes, cookies, cupcakes and brownies. Baral began baking in 2020, during the lockdown, and launched her online shop last year.She grows much of the produce she incorporates into her baking, and believes we should all understand the origins of our food. “This connection fosters gratitude and a deeper appreciation for nature,” she says. Her background in environmental science, coupled with her affinity for the natural world, imbues her creations with a unique artistic sensibility. Each item she bakes is a testament to her creativity and experimentation, as she believes consistent practice is the key to mastery.Despite the demands of being a full-time student, Baral strives to accommodate orders, typically requiring a minimum of 72 hours' notice for delivery. She is a passionate and discerning individual, evident in the love she infuses into her baking. Additionally, Baral advocates for a zero-waste policy at home, ensuring that every scrap of food and all household items are recycled.Three easy to bake recipes you can try at homeMini carrot cakes Ingredients:38 g milk or yoghurt35 g all-purpose flour1/4 tea spoon ground cinnamon1/8 tea spoon ground gingerA pinch of cardamom1 tea spoon baking powder½ tea spoon fine sea salt2 large eggs, at room temperature27 g granulated sugar13 g brown sugar (or 39 g of regular granulated sugar)1 tea spoon vanilla extract27 g extra virgin olive oil33 g carrots, peeled and shreddedChopped walnutsCandied lemon or orange slices (optional for garnish)Cream cheese frosting56.5 g unsalted butter, softened113.5 g cream cheese, softened1/2 teaspoon vanilla extractA pinch of salt250 g powdered sugarDirections:For the cake:Preheat the oven to 195°C.

The vegetable is relatively cheap and used in almost all cuisines and curries. This ubiquity could perhaps be why someone might be snubbingly called an ‘aloo’ in Nepal, but the reference does not make potatoes less important.Why have them With zero fat, potatoes contain many important nutrients—vitamins B1, B6, Vitamin C, which is an antioxidant, minerals and fibre. Along with starch, it is a good source of potassium, copper, vitamin C, manganese, phosphorus, niacin, dietary fibre and pantothenic acid. Potassium derived from potatoes is an electrolyte that benefits the heart, muscles and nervous system. Potato skin contains fibre, which is important for digestive health.Compared to other vegetables, potatoes are more energy-dense. It is free of fat, gluten, cholesterol and sodium. The relatively cheap plant-based food is also a good source of carbohydrates. Filled with nutrients, one can get a lot of them by consuming potatoes.Sourcing of potatoesPotatoes thrive in diverse climatic conditions. The country cultivates potatoes on around 200,000 hectares of land—from the plains of Tarai to the mountainous region.Every year, Nepal churns out around 3,410,000 tons of the stuff. It also imports potatoes and potato products worth Rs 8.71 billion.“These imports include potato chips, frozen potatoes and fresh potatoes,” said Biswas Poudel, a senior technical officer at the National Potato Research Programme.As its cultivation is possible in diverse landscapes, even climate change does not affect potato farming, experts say. Types of potatoesRed and white potatoes are popular and widely available in the country. Lately, dark potatoes or blue potatoes are gaining popularity.“Red potatoes are highly popular,” said Poudel. “Potatoes that come in colour contain more nutrients. Darker potatoes are packed with antioxidants.”Potatoes that taste sweet are a good source of vitamin A, an important nutrient for immunity and eye health. Purple potatoes are rich in antioxidants, including anthocyanins that may prevent heart disease and cancer and boost brain health.Other benefits As potatoes contain important nutrients, they benefit human health in multiple ways. Iron, phosphorus, calcium, magnesium, and zinc contained in potatoes help the body build and maintain its structure and strength. Consumption of the vegetable that is rich in potassium, calcium and magnesium helps reduce blood pressure naturally. Potatoes also contain a significant amount of fibre, which helps in lowering cholesterol levels in the blood and ultimately lessens the risk of heart disease. Fibre also boosts digestive health.Compared to other green vegetables, farmers use only a minimal amount of pesticides in potatoes, making them safe to eat. Chips and french friesOf late potato chips and french fries are gaining popularity in Nepal. They are also popular dishes in most restaurants and people have even started making french fries at home. Children love potato chips the most. Intake of nutrients and micronutrients, fibre and antioxidants components depends on how potatoes were cooked or prepared for food.Consumption of a lot of chips and french fries can lead to added calories and unhealthy weight gain.“Fibre and antioxidant and other micronutrients of the potatoes may be lost while frying,” said Poudel. “As potatoes are a carbohydrate-rich vegetable, it is not necessary to consume them with rice, which many people do in Nepal.”Experts say diabetic people should limit their potato intake as they cause spikes in blood sugar. \nThe noise of ever-growing traffic, the breaking and mending of black-topped roads, and an ever-expanding concrete jungle are some features that one would associate with the Kathmandu Valley.It is a wildly growing urban forest quickly transforming into a busy metropolis where every inch of space is ready to be sold and built. Yet, pockets of the past remain—small, peaceful neighbourhoods where houses are still made of wood, paths are made of stone tiles, and the stillness of a world that wants to stay intact and immobile. These places are known for tourism, culture, and the restoration of community pride. One such stop is the quiet village of Khokana in southern Lalitpur.Khokana is comparatively close to the mainland urban Lalitpur; from the ring road junction of Bagdole, it takes only a 10-minute drive to reach there. From the airport, you can take a cab directly to Khokana, which will take around half an hour. Get your cameras and hiking boots ready; the area is filled with historical artefacts and hiking trails.However, it is vastly different from the city. It is much nearer to the hills, where stone-paved paths, which could easily be goat trails, are rare in today’s Kathmandu.One such goat trail leads to Sikali temple, a major attraction of the area and accessible only on foot. The pavements are lined with big and small temples on each side, along with ponds that serve as clean water sources and a location for religious rituals. The houses are made of bricks and wood. The concrete invasion, although present, is minimal. Scattered every few hundred metres are small mustard oil mills, co-operative businesses of the locals of Khokana that have existed since medieval times.A site well-recognised for its historical significance, Khokana was even proposed to be made a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1996. Sikali TempleAround an hour’s walk from the historic town, Sikali Temple can be reached, which is also the location for its famed Sikali Jatra.While it can be reached through any public vehicle, a more holistic and adventurous route is to follow the goat trails on the outskirts of Khokana. This route, albeit long, allows for great hiking opportunities, scenic views of the hills surrounding the Kathmandu Valley, and a close-up view of the mediaeval but well-maintained architecture of the local houses.Even if you lose the way, which is very possible, the locals are very welcoming and more than willing to guide you. The main temple itself is three stories tall, and built in the Pagoda style, a common style in many temples in the valley.It is surrounded by a lush grass field which plays the stage to the Sikali Jatra held every year. The temple, like many religious spots around Khokana, is dedicated to the local deity Shree Rudrayani.The Sikali Jatra, a five-day festival that serves as an alternative to Dashain for the Khokana locals, is filled with chariot dances, battle enactments, and storytelling celebrations in the worship of Goddess Rudrayani.Starting from Ghatasthapana in mid to late September, the Jatra is vibrant and an essential experience for every visitor. Historical Khokana townKhokana’s historical town is located around 5 minutes walking distance from the local bus park. The town complex, paved with hand-made stone tiles, is graced with the Indrayanee temple but also has many red-bricked houses built in the local Newari architecture, some of them centuries old.One such house is the ‘Khokana Museum’. Although closed, it is widely popular for being the first house to be lit with electricity in Nepal, as Chandra Shamsher did in 1911.The stand-holder of the first light bulb can still be seen, serving as a historical monument for everyone to see.Similarly, the town complex is also filled with Guthi houses, small ponds, and even the local Ward office. While the Ward office provides a wealth of information for visitors interested in the area’s history, the Guthi halls symbolise the strong community support culture of the locals.The ponds, a notable one present right opposite the Indrayanee temple, have stone taps and remind us of primitive ways of obtaining clean water—a practice many locals are still engaged in.Yet, these ponds are also religious locations, especially used in rituals in the Sikali Jatra.Finally, a stroll through the complex allows visitors to explore old houses and historical artefacts in the serene quietness of Khokana, while the small outlets and Choila places nearby allow you to enjoy the spicy duck or chicken delicacies at the same time.Overall, the historical complex is enough to transport visitors back to a glimpse of the medieval past of the Kathmandu Valley. Mustard oil millsThe most well-known feature of Khokana is its mustard oil mills, which have been operational for hundreds of years and have been using the same methods of preparation since their inception.These mills, scattered throughout Khokana, are often community-owned, and even the ones owned by certain individuals have almost exclusively employed locals.Despite the advent of modern machinery, there is still substantial demand for their products due to the assured guarantee.When I visited one such mill, the local staff informed me that the furnace and oil presser used by them were 300 years old, given by the Patan royalty even before the Shahs became king.In addition to buying pure, organically created mustard oil and pellets, visiting these oil mills offers many educational benefits for international and local tourists alike.Khokana offers visitors a unique glimpse into a preserved bubble of the past through its tranquillity, preservation of ancient lifestyle and cultural elements, and remarkable self-sustenance.  \n“How much oxygen do you have for the summit?”I think this is the kind of question a film producer would ask. But when you're on the mountain, the answer is never clear.I have worked for a long time in the film industry and different art areas, especially photography and engraving.Working in various fields and drawing inspiration from them has become a new normal for me. I have made this approach my way of life without even realising it.I took responsibility for producing the last movie I worked on and shot the behind-the-scenes footage for a documentary. By doing so, I witnessed the entire shooting process and the journey of a movie.In the snowy highlands of Turkey, we had to endure the consequences of the changing climate to shoot ‘About Dry Grasses’, directed by Nuri Bilge Ceylan. The highlands used to be snowy in January, but by the time we got there in the same month, there was no snow. Nature was changing. It was responding to what was happening—to what humanity had done to it. In the end, it snowed, and we shot the intense snow scenes we wanted. But since most of our days were sunny, unlike what the director wanted, we had to shoot in the sunset and sunrise hours. As crew members, we spent many days waiting for the sun to set.Production requires creating opportunities, finding solutions, and being creative for a work of art to come true. For this, patience, endurance, calmness, and timing are necessary. On the other hand, nature wanted us to listen to it and wait for the right time.During that time, I witnessed many of nature's lessons. For example, I experienced extreme cold for the first time. We endured temperatures ranging from -33 degrees to +55 degrees. By listening to nature, surrendering to its forces, and working within its limits, we managed to persevere.No matter how much you prepare or plan during the pre-production phase, if you are working in nature, remember that nature will always have the final say.The film was completed, released, and connected with audiences. Its success at Cannes 2023 was followed by my trip to the North Pole for my project. I returned with a mix of wonderful developments, joys, and challenges. During this process, I experienced life and death, happiness and sadness, losses and awards.I realised the value of being able to breathe comfortably a few days after my father's chemotherapy ended. Just a few days earlier, he had said, \"Well done, my daughter. I'm glad you went!\" All the anxiety and hard work, filled with fears at the beginning, were finally behind me.Before going to Everest, when I was on the verge of giving up, defeated by my fears, I remembered my father's words. Everest reminded me of what he said while struggling to breathe, adding a turning point to my life.What does it mean to say ‘life’s turning point?’ How many turning points can there be in life?Who am I, and what am I doing in this world? How well do I know my own limits? Can I find answers to these big questions? These thoughts sparked my dream of journeying to Everest. Now, after returning, I can say that it turned my life around.“How much oxygen do you need for the summit?” sounds more like “How much do you need to hold on to life?” How many reasons do you find that give meaning to your life, keep you alive, and allow you to breathe? How much can you endure in the face of obstacles, and can you keep believing that a solution will eventually come your way?Can these questions be separated from the idea of measuring and assessing something, from learning its quantity and financial value? Can everything be known with certainty? Should the journey be fully understood in advance, with all its promises laid out? Should it be viewed like a purchase with a price tag, asking, “Is this journey worth this much?”I had never trekked before and had no climbing experience. I had lived at sea level my entire life and had never been to a high altitude.However, this journey was not only about the physical climb but also an inner discovery. After losing my father to lung cancer, his breathing difficulties taught me the fragility of breath, life, and existence. I also mentally prepared myself for the physical challenges I might face. Despite all my concerns, could this journey help me understand the cycle of life and the resilience of the soul?So, how could I make this trek possible? How could I land in Nepal? Despite all the economic difficulties and the many things I felt needed organising, I did my best and believed in it.Since I was embarking on this journey, I felt I should share about my travels and inspire others.Starting with photography, cinema, and engraving, which are already integral parts of my life, I dreamed of documenting and sharing the inspiring aspects of this journey.After months of correspondence and dreaming, it all came true. Finally, I embarked on the journey with the goal of creating photographs, engravings, and documentaries. I learned a great deal from my travels in Nepal, from the people I met, and from every moments I witnessed. I felt incredibly fortunate to have been able to honour my father’s memory with the peace and serenity I experienced in the Himalayas.During my 15-day journey to Everest Base Camp, I encountered nature’s masterpieces at every turn. As concerns like “How will I endure?” and “How will I finish?” started to weigh on me, the mountains suddenly parted with the clouds and gazed down at me.It was amazing to witness the appearance of ‘Gods’ that I had never seen before, in such immense size and in such a close, awe-inspiring manner beside me during that silent walk.As someone who came from one of the most crowded cities in the world, Istanbul, while I struggled with my daily questions and uncertainties, trying to control everything, they stood there calmly, as if answering me.They were just there—before and after.My guide, Lakhpa Sherpa, always reminded me not to worry about how high we were, how long it would take to reach our accommodation, or what the weather would be like. He encouraged me to live in the moment, and he was right.He advised me to focus on my breathing, not to get thirsty, to eat enough, and to appreciate the extraordinary beauty of the journey. In the mountains, plans dissolve and each moment is embraced as it comes.All the good wishes, prayers, and everything encountered along the way were for the journey itself. The mountain was full of life, secrets, and everything I had wondered about.This 15-day journey to Everest Base Camp was a solo adventure, yet I wouldn't have been able to complete it without my guide, Lhakpa, and my porter. Additionally, I was fortunate enough to experience the hospitality, generosity, and honesty at Trekkers Paradise, which organised the entire journey and provided guidance.I witnessed how dedication and sincerity are crucial in completing a journey safely and healthily. Ghanshyam Sharma, from Trekkers Paradise and Sauraj Jhingan, a climber who summited the Everest in 2018, shared their experiences with me during the journey.They experienced the 2015 earthquake while they were at the Everest Base Camp.As a filmmaker, their role as actors, and attention to detail played a significant role in bringing my dream photography and documentary project to life.The sponsors of my journey were Turkish Airlines, The North Face, Apple, Canon, and Stanley. My supporters include Oscar International College and Nepal Film Campus. Throughout the journey, I shared many experiences, memories, and countless photos and images with my students.On my way back home after 21 days, I celebrated my birthday on the plane. From the right window, the Himalayas bid me farewell. I felt like I had opened a new chapter in my life, and I was certain that I would return.I had made many friends and memories in Nepal.For now, I will be working on a documentary and preparing for a photography and engraving exhibition titled ‘My Soul Beyond the Mountain’.To the Himalayas: This summer was spent with you, but we will meet again soon. \nJournalists embarked on a five-day tour of Sri Lanka, covering over 1,000 kilometers, exploring religious sites, tea estates, a national park, and the economic recovery of the country's tourism industry.\nMundhum Trek in Koshi province in the eastern part of Nepal is a new cultural walking trail. It passes through several indigenous ethnic villages and landscapes in Khotang and Bhojpur districts. This trail goes up to an elevation of 4,200 metres to the viewpoint of Silchung Peak and takes one through the settlements of the Kirati people. This route starts from Diktel Bazaar and passes through beautiful settlements like Chakhewa, Rawa Dhap, Salpa Bhanjyang, Silchung and Hanspokhari before ending in Bhojpur. There are some hotels in Diktel but trekkers are advised to carry tents. The trail offers panoramic views of most of the eight-thousanders, including Everest, Lhotse, Makalu, Cho Oyu and Kanchenjunga mountains. The spring season, March through May, is highly recommended for the trek.Janaki Mandir Janaki Mandir at Janakpur in Madhesh province was constructed in 1874 and is a blend of Mughal and local architecture. The temple is a three-storey building and has 60 rooms, making it the largest temple in Nepal. Pilgrims flock here by the thousands to pay homage to Janaki Mandir—Janaki being the other name of Sita, the daughter of King Janak. The temple houses an idol of Sita which was found near Ayodhya, the kingdom of Ram. The marriage anniversary of Lord Ram and Sita is celebrated in Janakpur every year on Vivaha Panchami, which falls in December. In the southwest corner of Janaki Mandir is the Vivaha Mandap, which has been built at the site where the marriage of Ram and Sita is said to have taken place. Another well-known temple in the vicinity is Ram Mandir, which is built in pagoda style and is hence different from the other temples in Janakpur that generally bear resemblance to Mughal architecture. It houses a female statue, said to be of Yogamaya, which has the reputation of being one of the most beautiful images of female forms in Nepal. Other holy sites of interest include the Laxman Temple, Sankat Mochan Temple and Hanuman Temple.Kuri Village, Kalinchok Kuri village, a popular tourist destination around 150 km from Kathmandu, lies at an altitude of 3,842 metres above sea level in Kalinchowk of Dolakha district, in Bagmati province. People visit the place to enjoy the snow during the winter besides the mesmerising landscapes and splendid panoramic view of the Himalayan range. Kalinchok gets snow mainly at the end of December and the snowfall continues till the end of February or mid-March. When there is snow, it is difficult for jeeps, buses and cars to reach the top of Kuri village. Chains are wrapped around the wheels of vehicles and specially modified jeeps with highly experienced drivers are used to carry visitors. There are several hotels and restaurants in the area. The road up to Kuri has also improved over the years.Annapurna Base Camp Annapurna Base Camp trek, in Gandaki province, makes for a picturesque journey that takes you to the foothills of the Annapurna South, up to 4,130 metres above sea level. The five-day trek (seven days for slow walkers) offers rich cultural diversities, typical Nepali villages and the flora and fauna nestled at the foothills of Annapurna. The distance from Pokhara to Annapurna Base Camp is approximately 81 kilometres. It is among the shortest and most budget-friendly treks in Nepal. For Nepalis, lodging costs around $5 to $10 per day. For foreigners, the overall cost of the trek ranges from $800 to $1500 on average per person. Annapurna Base Camp trek can be done at any time throughout the year as each season offers a different trekking experience. The ideal time for the trek depends on your weather preferences and what you expect from it. However, autumn (September to October) and spring (March to May) are considered the two best seasons for the trek, as the days at the time are warm and bright with clear skies.Bardiya National Park Bardiya National Park, located in the southern Tarai belt of Lumbini province, is home to one of the most elusive and majestic animals on earth—the Royal Bengal Tiger. The park, which covers an area of 968 square kilometres, is considered one of the most important protected areas in the country. It is a prime destination for those looking to catch a glimpse of a tiger. A bit of luck and patience will offer a good chance to see the Bengal Tiger. The jungle safari also offers one the opportunity to spot Asian elephants and the greater one-horned rhinoceros. The rare Gangetic river dolphins are occasionally spotted on rafting trips along the Geruwa River, the eastern channel of the Karnali river. Besides, visitors can enjoy the homestays and explore local Tharu culture. The right time to visit the park is from mid-September to mid-December and mid-February to May.Khaptad National Park Khaptad National Park in Sudurpaschim province is a protected area in the far western region. It stretches over four districts of Bajhang, Bajura, Achham and Doti and ranges in elevation from 1,400 to 3,300 metres. The park can be visited throughout the year. Trekkers are advised to bring their tents, food and other supplies. The Nepal Tourism Board says of late, social media has been increasingly influencing Nepali travellers to go to Khaptad. Since the far-flung Khaptad National Park is still offbeat for many travellers, the area remains pristine and fresh. The seasons of spring (March-May) and autumn (October-November) are the ideal times to visit the park. The temperature ranges from 10°c to 20°c offering pleasant trekking weather. The monsoon begins in June and lasts until September and during this time, roads often become muddy and slippery. From December to February, winter brings snow and chilling winds to the park.Limi Valley \nOnce again, my heart swelled with joy when my hometown came into view.Arriving at Lalikharka after the treacherous journey through Pauwa Bhanjyang and the bustling Kanchhi Dokan, Phidim, the headquarters of Panchthar district, revealed itself like a surprise gift. My home town, Phidim, is unique in the fact that it reveals to travellers approaching it from uphill. As the vehicle descends the mountain road, it slowly comes into view, its houses and buildings recognisable for the native son.This Dashain, I undertook the much-awaited trip to my hometown with my wife Kabita and daughter Aarohi. Little did I anticipate the transformation that awaited me.The moment I got out of the jeep, I noticed that Phidim, nestled in the lush hills, has undergone a remarkable transformation over the years. As I guided my family to my home, which had suffered damages in the 1989 quake that struck eastern Nepal, I found that old, mud and stone houses had been replaced by concrete buildings. The place was vastly different from the one I remembered.Arriving at my childhood home felt like reuniting with an old friend. Navigating its nooks and crannies with my daughter, we delved into the history of the house, a symbol of my cherished memories.My wife had visited Phidim years ago, spending a month with my parents. She, too, recalled beautiful moments she had had in the town. I asked the tenant about the neighbours and acquaintances. Some had died, while others had left for good.A call to local journalist Giriraj Banskota led me to the school grounds, where memories flooded back. This was where I spent my teenage years, playing ball, learning to kick, and watching major tournaments. Here, I even encountered a group of Western climbers headed to Kanchenjunga, the world’s third-highest mountain. I remember being awed by their shiny yellow tents, headlights and strange smell. I remember practising my tutephuteko Angrezi with the climbers. Birendra Shield, an annual sports tournament named after the late king, brought ace players from various schools in Panchthar district. The district also hosted Yuba Mela, an annual three-day fair to commemorate the birthday of the king, organising football tournaments in which teams from as far as Sunsari and Taplejung participated. I never excelled at dribbling balls. A boy growing up in a seven-member family, I soon found my interest in literature. In the late 1980s, Phidim hosted a major literary festival. In the run-up to the 1990 pro-democracy protest, walls were painted with anti-monarchy slogans, local politicians were arrested. I took my family to my school, Naya Namuna Secondary School. It was Saturday, so the school was closed. I peeked through the steel gate and wall, imagining myself labouring over classes. Memories are hazy, but what I remember most is going out of the school—to quiz contests with me leading the school team, to essay competitions at the District Education Office and to play carom board, a national pastime, in a nearby shopfront. Returning to the main street, the demolition of a landmark gate made me reflect on how cities transform, shedding old landmarks for new identities. Navigating narrow alleyways, I felt like a stranger in my own hometown. Multistory buildings have emerged and roads have been paved, reshaping the town. It’s the same place with a different face, leaving me nostalgic for the Phidim of my memories.We finally reached Shivalaya temple, which I told my wife and daughter was one of my cherished hangouts. A giant statue of Falgunanda (the Kirant leader’s birthday is celebrated on November 10) stood before the steps to the temple. Though my wife suspected I came here to smoke, in reality, I visited the temple in the evening to meet friends and talk about issues that mattered most to us at the time. It also offered a panoramic view of the town (I could not take my family to Gadhi Danda, a hillock across the Shivalaya).Towards the end of my journey, I felt sad about Phidim’s lack of prospects. To my dismay, I found that people have been leaving the town in droves. Despite blacktopped roads and multi-story buildings, Phidim faces a troubling reality. The lack of quality higher education and specialist healthcare has driven people away, echoing the circumstances that led me to Kathmandu years ago. Conversations with locals confirmed a mass exodus from the town, a trend that raises concerns about Phidim's future.My conversations with familiar strangers led me to conclude that Phidim has transformed into a transit town for pilgrims heading to Pathibhara Devi Temple, which is around 255 kilometres north in Taplejung district. I met dozens of people headed to the holy site. While pilgrims see it as a stopover, for me, it was a homecoming. The realisation dawned that Phidim is, perhaps, in a state of transition, trading its rustic charm for the hallmarks of urbanisation. While I left Phidim for higher education in Kathmandu, people from rural areas have flocked to the town in search of better opportunities, bringing life and energy to the once quiet community.As we bid adieu to my hometown, I couldn’t help but reflect on the inevitability of leaving a place, no matter how enamoured one is with it. Passing Kanchhi Dokan, I pointed out Kanchnajungha and Kumbhakarna to my daughter—symbols of my childhood. Phidim, now a blend of nostalgia and change, remains etched in my heart, a testament to the intricate dance between memory and evolution. \nEngland finally showed their true colours at the European Championship on Wednesday, putting on a convincing and effective performance when it mattered most to book themselves a berth in Sunday’s final in Berlin.Ollie Watkins’ late winner to secure the 2-1 win over the Netherlands was as much as they deserved after dominating the encounter in a display their supporters had been eagerly awaiting but barely daring to hope for.It was an emphatic answer after the criticism heaped on the side for some languid showings against underwhelming opposition earlier in the tournament, and sets up a mouth-watering final against a slick-looking Spain.England had frustrated their followers, looking pedestrian at times in the group phase as well as their knockout round games. It was as if they were suffocating at times under a heavy burden of expectation, a feeling coach Gareth Southgate said on Tuesday that they learned to leave behind as they went deeper into the tournament.Their round of 16 performance as they edged Slovakia bordered on the miraculous, snatching victory minutes from being eliminated, and there was a nervy showing as they fought back, again, to edge Switzerland on penalties in the quarter-final.This time, however, there was a positivity about their play from the start, even if it was a third successive game where they went behind, this time to Xavi Simons’ spectacular seventh minute effort.Harry Kane’s penalty equaliser was followed by a sustained period of pressure on the Dutch defence, with England shaking off the cobwebs and properly greasing the wheels of their attack.The individual quality of their players was on full display and they had their opponents pegged back, looking dangerous every time they entered the final third. Phil Foden was exceedingly unlucky not to have them ahead at halftime with some sublime skill but had his effort cleared off the line.The second period was not as dominant as fatigue set in and the Dutch enjoyed their fair share of possession.But even then, whenever England moved menacingly forward, a goal looked on the cards.It was almost to script that they engineered victory just before the final whistle, as Watkins emerged an unlikely hero not long after coming on.The confidence boost cannot be underestimated, especially as an in-form opponent awaits on Sunday at the Olympiastadion.When they needed to stand up and be counted, the real England came to the party and, after almost a month of gritty competition, the tournament has two worthy finalists. \nColombia beat Uruguay 1-0 in their Copa America semi-final on Thursday despite being reduced to 10 men for 45 minutes to book a title decider against defending champions Argentina thanks to a first-half header from Jefferson Lerma.Uruguay’s Darwin Nunez missed several chances in the first half and Colombia made them pay when Lerma rose above the defence on a corner in the 39th minute and squeezed his header past goalkeeper Sergio Rochet.Colombia went down to 10 men just before halftime when Daniel Munoz lost his cool and got himself sent off, with the right back receiving a second yellow card for elbowing Manuel Ugarte in the chest when play was stopped.Uruguay dominated possession in the second half and veteran striker Luis Suarez nearly equalised when he hit the post but Colombia bravely held on for a famous win and will play Argentina in Sunday’s final.Uruguay will play Canada a day earlier in the third-place playoff. \nNepal national women’s cricket team suffered back-to-back defeat in their ACC Women’s T20 Asia Cup preparatory tour as they lost to Sri Lanka Development Squad by four wickets in their second practice match at Surrey Village Cricket Stadium in Maggona on Wednesday.Chasing 107 set by Nepal, Sri Lanka Development Squad overhauled the target in 19.5 overs losing six wickets.The hosts needed 20 runs from their last two overs, and Malki Madara played an explosive six-ball 16 to guide her side to victory.Senarathne and Imika Mendis had laid the foundation for the win with a 33-run opening stand. Senarathne scored 27 runs off 37 balls, while Mendis made 17 facing 21 deliveries.Sandeepani contributed 19 runs.Kritika Marasini, Kabita Joshi, captain Indu Barma and Sabnam Rai took a wicket apiece for Nepal.Earlier, Nepal opted to bat first after winning the toss and posted 106-7 from their 20 overs.Kabita Kunwar top-scored for Nepal with 29 runs off 34 balls. Skipper Barma provided the next best score, hitting 28 off 43.The duo also put on a 32-run stand for the second wicket after opener Shamjhana Khadka departed making 11 in the 2.5 overs.Rubina Chhetri (6), Kabita Joshi (4), Dolly Bhatta (1) and Bindu Rawal (8) could not do much with the bat.Dewmi Vihanga was the pick of Sri Lanka Development Squad bowling, taking 3-20. Sandeepani took 2-13, while Tharika Sewwandi and Sandinu Nisansala pocketed one wicket each.Nepal had lost their first practice match by 33 runs on Tuesday.Nepal play their third and final warm up game against the same opponents next Tuesday.The preparatory series will serve as Nepal’s preparation for the upcoming 2024 ACC Women’s T20 Asia Cup, which is set to take place from July 19 to July 28 in Dambulla.Nepal, drawn in Group A, will open their Asia Cup against the United Arab Emirates on July 19. They play their next group matches against 2012 and 2016 runners-up Pakistan on July 21 and holders and record seven-time champions India on July 23.Group B includes 2018 champions Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Malaysia and Thailand.Nepal are making their third appearance at the Women’s Asia Cup.They previously played the biennial competition in 2012 in China and 2016 in Thailand.The top two teams from each group will progress to the semi-finals, which will be played on July 26.The final will be played on July 28. \nDefending champions Argentina booked their place in the Copa America final after goals from Julian Alvarez and Lionel Messi gave them a 2-0 win over Canada in Tuesday’s semi-final in New Jersey.Argentina have won a joint-record 15 Copa titles and reached the final six times in the past eight editions but Canada caused them problems in the opening 20 minutes, Jacob Shaffelburg twice shooting wide from promising positions.After soaking up the early pressure Argentina went ahead when Rodrigo De Paul played through Alvarez, who ghosted in between two defenders to score with a tidy finish in the 22nd minute.2022 World Cup winners Argentina gradually took control of the match and Messi had a chance to double their lead in the 44th minute as he created space in the box with silky footwork before lashing his effort wide.Canada nearly snatched an equaliser against the run of play in first-half stoppage time as Jonathan David sneaked in ahead of his marker to get on the end of a long throw, but his close-range shot was hit straight at goalkeeper Emiliano Martinez.Messi then scored Argentina’s second in the 51st minute when he stuck out a boot to divert Enzo Fernandez's shot from the edge of the area past Canada goalkeeper Maxime Crepeau.The goal moved Messi to joint fifth in the all-time Copa America scoring charts, level with Peru’s Paolo Guerrero and Chile’s Eduardo Vargas on 14.The 37-year-old’s 109th goal for Argentina also saw him surpass Iran’s Ali Daei on the all-time international scoring charts. Messi is second behind Cristiano Ronaldo, who has scored 130 goals for Portugal.Despite their two-goal cushion, Argentina had a nervy finish to the match as Canada substitute Tani Oluwaseyi tested Martinez with a crisp shot in the 89th minute before directing a glancing header wide a minute later.Argentina will take on either Uruguay or Colombia, who meet on Wednesday, in the final in Florida on Sunday. \nSpain struck twice in five minutes in a pulsating first half to secure a 2-1 comeback win over France on Tuesday as a record-breaking goal from teenager Lamine Yamal and a Dani Olmo effort propelled them into the Euro 2024 final.The 16-year-old Yamal cancelled out Randal Kolo Muani’s opener with a sublime shot in the 21st minute to become the youngest scorer in a Euro or World Cup before Olmo added another in the 25th for his third goal in the knockout stage.The Spaniards, who have won every game of the tournament so far, confirmed their favourites tag with another display of attacking football, especially in the first half, that is a far cry from the tiki-taka passing game that earned them world and European titles more than a decade ago.“I’m very happy to have made it to the final,” said man-of-the-match Yamal. “Now the most important thing is to win it. We were in a difficult moment, you wouldn’t expect a goal so soon.”“I wanted to put it in where it went in, and I’m very happy. I’m happy and content with the victory. I want to win, win and win,” added the teenager.They will now face the winners of Wednesday’s match between England and Netherlands in the final in Berlin on Sunday as they hunt a record-breaking fourth European crown.It was a anti-climactic end to France’s tournament, although the 2022 World Cup finalists never lived up to expectations in Germany with a very low conversion rate that carried into the semi-final.“Spain proved tonight that they are a very good team. We were fortunate to open the scoring, but they caused us problems because they were superior in terms of control,” said France coach Didier Deschamps.“Tonight they showed all their qualities. We were... perhaps a little less fresh, which led to some technical waste, particularly in the build-up of the game. We didn’t push forward often enough.”Spain had an early chance when Yamal, the youngest player to feature in a World Cup or Euro semi-final, floated a cross to the far post but Fabian Ruiz headed over the bar.FRANCE GOALFrance did better from an almost identical move in the ninth minute with Kylian Mbappe, playing without a mask after breaking his nose earlier in the tournament, crossing for Kolo Muani to head in their first goal from open play at Euro 2024.But the Spaniards, who were missing suspended Dani Carvajal and Robin Le Normand as well as injured Pedri, quickly turned the game around.Yamal curled a stunning left-footed effort from 25 metres in off the post to break another record held by Brazil great Pele, as the youngest scorer in a Euro or World Cup.Before France had any time to recover Olmo completed their lightning-quick comeback in the 25th with a shot that was deflected in by France’s Jules Kounde.France, who had only conceded one goal in their previous five games in the tournament, upped the tempo after the break and had chances through Mbappe and Theo Hernandez.But they could not carve out an equaliser with Spain, pulling back and successfully soaking up the pressure. \nIndia’s Supreme Court granted interim bail on Friday to opposition leader and Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal in a graft case, but he will stay in jail due to his arrest in another case.Kejriwal was arrested in March by the Enforcement Directorate (ED), India’s financial crime-fighting agency, over alleged corruption in the city’s alcohol sales policy.A fierce critic of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and a former anti-corruption crusader, Kejriwal, 55, denies any wrongdoing and calls the case politically motivated.His lawyers had challenged his arrest in the top court, which referred the matter to a larger bench while giving him temporary relief.“Given that right to life and liberty is sacrosanct, and Arvind Kejriwal has suffered incarceration for over 90 days ... we direct that Arvind Kejriwal will be released on interim bail,” Justice Sanjiv Khanna said.However, Kejriwal remains in detention because of his arrest last month by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), India’s federal police, in another corruption case related to the Delhi liquor policy.His counsel Vivek Jain told Indian news agency ANI that he will seek his release on bail in the CBI case at the Delhi High Court on July 17.Kejriwal’s decade-old Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) has quickly risen in mainstream politics and voted to power in Delhi and in the northern state of Punjab, but its clout is still relatively smaller than older parties.He was previously granted temporary bail by the top court for three weeks until June 2 to campaign in national elections. \nUkraine on Thursday urged NATO allies to lift restrictions on its use of long-range weapons against targets in Russia, saying that would be “game-changer” in its war with Moscow, while China slammed NATO criticism of its support for Russia as biased and malicious.NATO members issued a declaration in support of Ukraine at a summit in Washington on Wednesday, promising additional aid and pledging to back its “irreversible path” to NATO membership.“At this summit we are turning a corner and putting in place the foundations for Ukraine to prevail,” NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg told a news conference after a three-day meeting in Washington of the 32 NATO states.“Today, we send a strong message of unity and resolve to Moscow that violence and intimidation do not pay, and that Ukraine can count on NATO now for the long haul.”Zelenskiy earlier called on allies to preserve their unified support of Ukraine and said new aid had to be delivered quickly.“If we want to win, if we want to prevail, to save our country and to defend it, we need to lift all the limitations,” he said.Zelenskiy’s cabinet chief Andryi Yermak told a public forum Russia had no restrictions on its use of weapons and it would be “a real game-changer” if Ukraine’s allies could lift all limits on the use of those they supply to Ukraine.NATO members have taken different approaches to how Ukraine can use weapons they donate. Some have made clear Kyiv can use them to strike targets deep inside Russia while the United States has taken a narrower approach, allowing its weapons to be used only just inside Russia’s border against targets supporting Russian military operations in Ukraine.Biden told the press conference the United States had allowed Zelenskiy to use American weapons in a limited way within Russia’s borders.Biden said he and US military and intelligence officials were making decisions on “a day-to-day basis on how far they should go in. That’s a logical thing to do.’The United States and its allies have used this week's summit to try to project unity in the face of what they see as a rising threat to Europe from Russia and China.However, NATO member Hungary said ahead of a meeting of NATO members with partners from the so-called Indo-Pacific Four - Australia, Japan, New Zealand and South Korea - that it does not want NATO to become an “anti-China” bloc, and will not support it doing so.Hungary’s Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto also told Hungarian state television that Ukraine’s admission to the military alliance would weaken unity in the group.Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban irked other NATO members with surprise visits to Kyiv, Moscow and Beijing in the past two weeks on a self-styled “peace mission”. He and Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump will meet on Thursday at the latter’s Florida home, according to three people with knowledge of the matter.Orban’s meeting in Moscow with Russian President Vladimir Putin in particular angered some fellow NATO allies, who said the trip handed legitimacy to Putin’s claims to Ukrainian territory seized since Russia’s 2022 invasion.Biden’s national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, told a public forum he would not speculate on whether Orban’s trip to Moscow was coordinated with Trump, Biden’s rival in the November US election, but said the Ukrainians had grave misgivings about any effort to negotiate a peace deal without them.“So whatever adventurism is being undertaken without Ukraine’s consent or support is not something that’s consistent with our policy, the foreign policy of the United States,” he said.ANGRY WORDS FROM CHINAWednesday’s NATO declaration included sharp words about China, calling it “a decisive enabler” of Russia’s war in Ukraine, and said Beijing continues to pose systemic challenges to Europe and to security.China’s Foreign Ministry said the declaration was biased and “sowing discord” and its mission to the European Union described it as being “full of Cold War mentality and belligerent rhetoric, and China-related content full of provocations, lies, incitement and smears.”At the news conference, Stoltenberg recalled language in the declaration by saying that “China cannot continue to fuel the largest military conflict in Europe without this impacting Beijing's interests and reputation.”China has repeatedly lashed out at NATO criticisms and has warned against its expansion into the Indo-Pacific.Japan, South Korea, New Zealand and Australia have forged stronger ties with NATO amid rising concerns over China’s pressure on rival claimants in disputed waters in the region and on democratic Taiwan, the global hub of cutting-edge chip production, which Beijing claims as its own. \nResidents of Gaza City were trapped in houses and bodies lay uncollected in the streets under an intense new Israeli assault on Thursday, even as Washington pushed for a peace deal at talks in Egypt and Qatar.Hamas militants say a heavy Israeli assault on Gaza City this week could wreck efforts to finally end the war just as negotiations have entered the home stretch.Home to more than a quarter of Gaza’s residents before the war, Gaza City was destroyed during the first weeks of fighting last year, but hundreds of thousands of Palestinians have returned to homes in the ruins. They have now once again been ordered out by the Israeli military.The Gaza health ministry said it had reports of people trapped and others killed inside their houses in the Tel Al Hawa and Sabra districts of Gaza City, and rescuers could not reach them.The Civil Emergency Service said it estimated that at least 30 people had been killed in the Tel Al-Hawa and Rimal areas and it could not recover bodies from the streets there.Despite army instructions on Wednesday to residents of Gaza City that they can use two “safe routes” to head south, many residents refused to heed the order. Some posted a hashtag on social media: “We are not leaving”.“We will die but not leave to the south. We have tolerated starvation and bombs for nine months and we are ready to die as martyrs here,” said Mohammad Ali, 30, reached by text message.Ali, whose family has relocated several times within the city, said they had been running short of food, water and medicine.“The occupation bombs Gaza City as if the war was restarting. We hope there will be a ceasefire soon, but if not then is God’s will.”Withdrawal from ShejaiaJust east of Gaza City in the Shejaia suburb, residents were returning on foot to a desolate moonscape of destroyed buildings after Israeli forces withdrew following a two-week offensive there.The territory’s main cemetery had been bulldozed by the army. People wheeled supplies on the back of bicycles across rubble-strewn tracks, passing the remains of burnt-out and blasted Israeli armoured vehicles.“We have returned to Shejaia after 15 days. You can see the destruction. They spared nothing, even trees, there was a lot of greenery in this area. What is the guilt of stones and trees? And what is my guilt as a civilian?” resident Hatem Tayeh told Reuters in the ruins.“There are bodies of civilian people. What is the guilt of the civilian? Who are you fighting?”Israel launched its assault on the Gaza Strip last year after Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel, killing 1,200 people and capturing more than 250 hostages according to Israeli tallies.Since then, Israel’s assault has killed more than 38,000 according to medical authorities in Gaza.At the southern edge of the enclave in Rafah near the border with Egypt, where tanks have been operating in most of the city since May, residents said the army continued to blow up houses in the western and central areas, amid fighting with Hamas, Islamic Jihad, and other smaller factions.Palestinian health officials said four people were killed, including a child, in an Israeli air strike in Tel Al-Sultan in western Rafah.The Israeli military said earlier on Thursday around five rockets fired from the Rafah area were successfully intercepted.The negotiations in Qatar and Egypt follow important concessions last week from Hamas, which agreed that a truce could begin and some hostages released without Israel first agreeing to end the war.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who faces opposition within his right-wing cabinet to any deal that would halt the war until Hamas is vanquished, says a deal must allow Israel to resume fighting until it meets all its objectives.Two Hamas officials contacted by Reuters had no immediate comment on the content of the ongoing talks, led by Egypt, Qatar, and the United States.“There will be a meeting today between Hamas and the mediators to check on what responses they have received from the occupation,” said one Palestinian official close to the mediation, without elaboration. \nNepal’s book market is no stranger to the popular Bangladeshi-Swedish writer Taslima Nasrin. Almost all of her books have been translated into Nepali, but Nasrin herself says that they are all unauthorised translations. “All books [Nepali translations] are pirated versions,” Nasrin told the Post in a Whatsapp conversation. Nasrin, who is currently in exile in India after facing death threats in Bangladesh following the publication of her novel Lajja (Shame), said that she or her publishers have never allowed anyone the right to translate her books into Nepali. “I don’t know of any such Nepali publishers. No one asked for permission and no one has paid [me] royalty.”Translating and publishing books without permission from authors or publishers is a punishable crime. But Nepal’s book market is full of such unauthorised translations and prints of books written by the who’s who of the world literature. Such endeavours haven’t just hurt the authors but also the readers, says Ajit Baral, publisher of the Kathmandu-based Fineprint publication. “These translations are poor,” Baral says. “Tomes with 1200–1300 pages have been trimmed to 200–300 pages. An example is the biography of Bill Clinton.”Another popular book that has seen unauthorised Nepali translation is the biography of Steve Jobs by Walter Isaacson.“We have no official deal in place for a [Nepali] translation of Steve Jobs,” Peppa Mignone, associate agent of the CAA, the translation authority of the biography, said in an email interview with the Post.The book’s Nepali translation is published by Panchpokhari Publication House. The translated book identifies the translator thus: “Achyut Koirala, who has a master’s in English literature, is primarily a journalist. He is currently affiliated with Nagarik daily. He keeps a close tab on international history, politics and culture and has written scripts and dialogues for half a dozen Nepali films. He has published over a dozen non-fiction books.”Koirala, who admits to the unauthorised translation, claims that he hasn’t just translated the book but has also done ‘creative writing’ with it.‘Rich Dad Poor Dad’, written by Robert Kiyosaki and Sharon Lechter, is among the books that’s perennially on the bestseller list across the world. Upon investigation, the Post found three Nepali translations of the book—all unauthorised. One of them is translated by Dilip Kumar Shrestha and published by the same firm, the Panchpokhari Publication House. Another Nepali iteration of the book is published by Book For All publication and translated by Kopila MD. Yet another Nepali version is translated by one Sudheer Dixit and published by Plata Publication, Kathmandu.In an email conversation with the Post, Ronson Taylor, who oversees the international rights at The Rich Dad Company, said, “At this point in time, we do not have a relationship with an established publisher in the [Nepali] language market. If there are any Rich Dad Poor Dad books currently for sale in the Nepali market, they are pirated.”Basanta Thapa, a writer and translator, says that many books are being translated of late to make easy money. “But how would the quality of these unauthorised translations be!” Thapa wonders. “Readers who haven’t read the original wouldn’t know the faults in the translated versions.” Thapa says that any translator worth his salt aims to ‘recreate’ a book and it takes much work to do that.Taslima’s books are the major victimsTaslima’s memoir Uttal Hawa has been translated into Nepali as ‘Sangharsha’, literally Struggle, and is published by Khoji Publication House. Even though the book in its cover claims that it is an authorised translation from the English version Wild Wind, it is a pirated one. The book is translated by Bikash Basnet and edited by Bhogiraj Chamling. A revised version of the book is edited by Sangeet Srota (Yam Bahadur Chhetri).The same publication house has also published the Nepali translation of the book’s sequel as ‘Prem ra Jeevan’. Publisher Sushil Chalise says that while he is aware that one needs to receive permission from the author or the publisher to translate a book, his efforts to contact Taslima were unsuccessful. Therefore, he had published the version the translator made available to him. Translator Basnet, too, admits he translated the book without Taslima’s permission. “About a decade back, we didn’t know how to ask for permission,” he said.Nepal has the Copyright Act (2002) in place. Before it, there was the The Patent, Design and Trade Mark Act, 2022 (1965) that included intellectual property in its 2006 revision. Even the Muluki Ain (Civil Code) of 1910 BS had a provision about copyright. Moreover, it goes without saying that translating somebody else’s work without permission is immoral.Likewise, Indigo Ink Pvt Ltd has published a Nepali translation of Taslima’s anthology of essays No Country for Women as ‘Aaimai ko Kunai Desh Chhaina’. The book is translated by Krishna Giri and edited by Pramod Pradhan. “I have no idea about the agreement between the publisher and translator,” Pradhan, who is also a children’s book writer, says. “I just copy-edited it upon request.”Bishnukumar Poudel, publisher of Indigo Ink, however, claims that he is still trying to take translation rights for the book. “We translated the book long ago,” he says. “We are still trying to get translation rights.”Indigo is also publishing unauthorised translations under its imprints All Book Store Pvt Ltd, Book for All and Plata Publication. It has published two versions of Rich Dad Poor Dad under those shadow imprints. But Plata Publication is not registered in the Company Registrar’s Office.Pradhan says that many foreign books have had unauthorised translations in Nepali and their quality is poor. Those books are translated not from the original language but from a second or third language, so these translations are bound to have problems, he says. “After I learned that those were unauthorised translations, I have stopped editing them,” Pradhan said.Indian author Shiv Khera’s You Can Win has been translated into Nepali by Bloomsbury India and has granted the distribution rights to Ekta Books. But the book’s unauthorised translations are also found in the market and they don’t even mention the name of the publisher and translator. What is interesting is they mention that it’d be illegal to republish the book, or an excerpt of it, without the author’s permission.The Nepali translation of the book, which was poorly written and rife with inaccuracies, had landed the publisher at court. After a complaint was filed at the District Court Kathmandu in 2066BS on the charge that the publisher violated the copyrights and economic rights, the court had issued a verdict on Mangsir 11 that year, charging a fine of Rs10,000, Rs20,000 and Rs30,000 to the defendants Netra Prasad Pokharel, Narayan Prasad Bhusal, and Bhagwati Risal and Bishnu Silwal, respectively.Baral, the Fineprint publisher, says that international publishers wouldn’t demand much for translation rights given Nepal’s small market, but Nepali publishers do not bother to reach out to them. “Publishers who put out unauthorised translations and sell them at 50 percent discount have troubled publishers like us,” he said.Fineprint has published authorised translated versions of books such as Leaving Microsoft to Change the World by John Wood, Healed by Manisha Koirala, and Hippie by Paulo Coelho. The publication house is also set to release the Nepali translation of Israeli historian Yuval Noah Harari’s bestseller Sapiens. Translated into Nepali by Dinesh Kafle, the book’s translation right was acquired at the cost of USD1300, Baral said. Likewise, the publication acquired the translation rights of Sadhguru’s Inner Engineering at IRS93,000, he added.Baral says that publication of unauthorised translations is an immoral and illegal work. “This phenomenon not just hampers Nepal’s fledgling book publishing industry but also tarnishes the country’s reputation in the global market,” Baral said.Thapa, the writer and translator, points out the lack of regulatory mechanisms in the country. “We don’t have an agency that regulates the quality of translations being done,” he says. “Nobody compares the translation with the original. We need a dedicated authority to enhance the quality of translation.” Universities, Nepal Academy and other stakeholders can play a role to uplift the translation sector, he adds.One’s pain, another’s pleasureWhen the author Suketu Mehta was travelling through Mumbai, a young man approached him with a handful of books while his vehicle was stuck in traffic. Brandishing Maximum City, written by none other than Mehta himself, the young man requested the author to buy a copy. Suketu leafed through the book and said, “This is a pirated copy and I’m the author of this book.” The youth wasn’t bothered and replied, “Okay, you can buy it at a discount.”This anecdote was shared to the Post by Mehta’s friend, the author and professor Amitava Kumar, in an email exchange.Most of these pirated books are imported into Nepal from India while the retailers of original books are finding themselves increasingly in trouble. “We sell original copies but many readers doubt us as well, given the ubiquity of pirated versions,” says Anjan Shrestha, operator of Education Book House, Jamal.Ramchandra Timothy, chair of Thapathali-based Ekta Books Pvt Ltd, said that the phenomenon of piracy has tarnished Nepal’s image internationally. “There was a time when Bangladesh would be known as ‘piracy king’,” he said. “Now there's a risk Nepal would take the crown.”As tax increases, so does piracyThe government decision to impose a 10 percent tax on book imports in fiscal year 2019-20 led to a proliferation of pirated book markets, booksellers say. After the decision, booksellers started to cut back on imports and that led to the entry of a new crop of pirated booksellers, a trader in Kathmandu says. But following widespread backlash, then finance minister Bishnu Paudel struck down the policy.“After the government’s decision, we stopped importing books for a while,” says Shrestha of Education Books. “The import of books went down for about two years. Then the pirates stepped in to fill the gap. It was about that time that pirated copies of biographies and memoirs of Obamas and Jai Shettys became omnipresent in the market.”Pirated copies of classics by Roald Dahl and JK Rowling also made an entry in the Nepali market. Then the phenomenon only saw a rise.Since the customs department does not levy duty on foreign books and also does not care to differentiate between the pirated and original copies, unauthorised books have found a safe haven in Nepali market.The government doesn’t levy any customs duty on books and newspapers published by foreign publishers abroad. The importers should only pay Rs565 at the customs points. But Nepali publishers have to pay 10 percent tax to import books printed in India.James Taylor, director of Communications and Freedom to Publish of the International Publishers Association, says that the government, publishers, writers and readers should join hands to control widespread piracy. “The government should realise that book publishing and reading culture contribute to the country’s economy as well,” he said, adding that the government should seize pirated books and close websites that sell pirated ebooks.Nandan Jha, executive vice chair of Penguin Random House India’s sales, production and business department, says that piracy has emerged as a big challenge for publishers of late and has harmed the authors, publishers, distributors, printers, readers and other stakeholders. “To confront piracy, all the stakeholders should launch a special joint effort,” Jha told the Post in an email exchange.Piracy has proliferated in the Nepali market to such an extent that the publishers of such books and unauthorised translations keep whatever ISBN numbers they like, often conflicting with other books, and still get off scot free. If scanned or searched on the internet, the ISBN number gives details on the author of the book, what the book is about, and its price, among others.Bijay Sharma, information officer at TU Library, says, “Keeping ISBN number at one’s will is illegal. If anyone files a complaint, we can punish them.”By the lawThe Muluki Ain-1910 BS had mandated that a publisher take permission of Gorkha Bhasa Prakashini Samiti before publishing any material. The Copyrights Act came into effect in 2022 BS and was amended in 2054 BS. In 2059 BS, a new Act was promulgated and it is still effective now. Authorities are currently working to amend the Act to give the registrar’s office more autonomy regarding copyright.According to the 2059 BS Act, copyright violations are considered government cases. In such cases, plaintiffs should file a complaint with the police. The Act’s clause 25 has various conditions that amount to violation of copyright. The Act’s subclause A says that if a publisher produces or copies material in writing or sound and sells or distributes it, it amounts to violation of copyright.Likewise, the Act’s clause 26 prevents selling of unauthorised material. The clause restricts the ‘importation of copies of work or sound recording, either made in a foreign country or sourced otherwise, into Nepal for business purpose shall not be permitted if preparation of such copies would be considered illegal if they were prepared in Nepal.’If anyone infringes upon protected rights, they are liable to punishment but the provision’s implementation remains lax.The law gives the authority to district court to take legal action against copyright violators.Advocate Parshuram Koirala says that if the government becomes more proactive, it can punish violators on the basis of the 2059 BS Act and thereby control the phenomenon of intellectual theft and copyright violations. “Creation is a crucial part of humanity’s benefit,” he says. “If intellectual property is not protected effectively, then there’d be no inspiration to create something.”Bal Bahadur Mukhiya, a professor at Nepal Law Campus, suggests the inclusion of rules about digital piracy in law, and also the clauses of various related international treaties and agreements that Nepal is part of.“In the US, a teacher or professor should pay a certain revenue even to photocopy a chapter of some text for teaching purposes,” Mukhiya says. “But in Nepal, those who photocopy an entire book and sell it go scot free.”(This report is prepared in collaboration with the Centre for Investigative Journalism, Nepal.) \nBharat Budha, chair of Putha Uttarganga Rural Municipality’s ward 10, knows that many youths from his village have made it to the United States via ‘tallo bato’—backdoor route—and that many are still on the way. He also knows that eight of them have been deported from the country and that they have lost a cumulative Rs45 million in the process. The deported youths say that they returned home empty-handed after facing unspeakable ordeals and lost Rs6 million each on average.The Tak village in Rukum East—a close-knit settlement of 425 houses—was considered the Maoists’ ‘base area’ during the insurgency. Village youths who reached the US through illegal routes and got deported have lost an estimated Rs40 million. The number of those who returned without completing the journey and the amount they lost remain unknown.To get to the US, the youths have taken loans at up to 36 percent interest per annum from their relatives and village landowners. In Tak village, at least one person each from half of the households has gone abroad, Budha said. “Youths started going to America about six-seven years ago,” he said. “If they could gather enough money, the whole village would try to go to the US.” Budha’s own son had reached the US illegally in 2017, spending Rs3.2 million.During the insurgency, outsize slogans of revolution would adorn the walls of houses in the village. Hoping for a better life, people from all walks of life helped out the Maoists. But now, village youths are paying the agents to illegally get to the US—a country that the Maoists used to call their ‘enemy’, an ‘imperialistic force’. This has cost the Tak village much and in multiple ways.Death of a dreamSome of the deported youths have chosen to flee the village altogether, burdened with debt and creditors’ pressure. At least five such families have already left, said a resident. The family of Ram Budha was one of them. On April 28, 2015, Ram, who had returned to Nepal after working in Malaysia for eight years, took the illegal route to the US. He travelled through arduous trails for months and finally arrived in the country. Upon reaching the country, he was detained and had to stay at the detention camp for 27 months. When his refugee application was rejected, he was deported to Nepal in mid-December 2019. He lost Rs4.5 million in the process. He now owes over Rs6 million to creditors. “After the creditors began to put pressure on me, I couldn’t live in the village peacefully,” said Ram, who currently runs a vegetable farm in Tarakeshwar, Kathmandu.While those who got to the US through illegal routes and fortunately got refugee status there narrate their stories with pride, those who have been deported or returned from half-way have tragic tales to tell.Nanda Kala Gharti, who lives in a small stone house on the upper flank of Tak village, spends her days in melancholy. Her husband, Dhanlal, had chosen to take the illegal route to the US, and Nanda Kala, a mother of four, is living with the repercussions of his decision. Dhanlal had got into the US after a six-month long arduous journey and was detained immediately. He had to spend four years in the detention camp, before he was deported to Nepal. He had already lost Rs6 million.Nanda Kala said they now have an insurmountable crisis in their hands. Pointing to her son, she exclaimed, “When will he grow up, go abroad and pay back the loans!”Dhanlal himself tried to go to Croatia once and spent 15 days in Kathmandu for the process. But after he was turned down, he returned home dejected. “Now we will submit the passport to another agent [for Dhanlal’s trip abroad],” Nanda Kala said. “There’s no point staying here.”Stories that echo each otherThe situation in Sisne Rural Municipality is similar to that of Putha Uttarganga. Here, one can hear plenty of stories of those who have tried to go to the US and those who are fighting refugee cases there. Krishna Regmi, chair of the rural municipality, personally knows seven people who have been deported from the US.Gangaram Khadka, a resident of Sisne-3, runs a bee and chicken farm. Like other young men in his village, Khadka had headed off to the US via an illegal route on 27 March, 2018. He had reached the US via the New Delhi-Moscow-Barcelona-Bogota-Panama-Costa Rica-Nicaragua-Honduras-Guatemala-Mexico route. When he finally arrived in the US, he was detained and had to spend 11 months in detention. He was deported on 15 March, 2019. He had handed over Rs3.2 millions to the agent and spent Rs2 million to fight the case to become a refugee. “It’s not possible for me to pay back the loan while working in Nepal,” he said. “I aim to pay back some interest and head off abroad again.”For six months after Khadka was deported, he had anxiety and headache, he said, adding the three people from his village who were deported like him are also struggling with their mental health.Tikaram Pun, a 40-year-old resident of Bohora village in Musikot-4, is also haunted by his past journey. In September 2017, he reached the US after crossing 17 countries with the help of organised human traffickers. Of the 41 people in his group, 31 were from Rukum East and Rukum West, he said. Pun, who was detained on arrival in the US, spent 24 months in a detention camp. His refugee application was also refused and so he was deported along with eight other Nepalis. “When I returned, I started having mental health problems. I still suffer from them,” he said. Pun is under pressure from creditors and relatives to pay back the Rs9.2 million loan he had taken for the task.Those who died on the wayA group of 10 Bangladeshis and seven Nepalis, including Rupak Bohora of Bafikot-3 in Rukum West, were on a mission to reach Costa Rica through Colombia, Caribbean Coast, Capuragana and Panama. But while they were crossing a sea, their boat capsized. As many as 12 died in the incident, including six Nepalis. Rupak’s wife, Geeta, learned about the incident only after six days, on 25 June, 2021.“I still don’t know what exactly happened,” said Geeta, who had been married off at age 19 and is now a mother of two daughters. The only thing she knows is that Rupak has died and she is now all alone. And that she has Rs5 million in loan taken for Rupak’s trip. She showed a picture of her husband on her phone to this scribe and said, “I only have memories.”Lack of political will and legal remediesThe concrete bridge over Chewang river is on the edge of Tak village. On the walls of the bridge are paintings of political theorists like Marx, Engels, Lenin, Stalin and Mao, and the iconic slogan, ‘Workers of the world, unite!’, below them. But the slogan appears to be at odds with life in the village. Given the phenomenon of illegal travels to the US through the help of organised human traffickers, the whole village appears to be emptying. Neither the local governments are concerned about the phenomenon nor are the political parties paying attention.Puniraj Gharti, chair of Putha Uttarganga Rural Municipality, said though the trend is worrying, there’s nothing he can do. “How could we stop them from making the trip when they are struggling to make a living in the village?” he said.Krishna Regmi, chair of Sisne Rural Municipality, said that the vicious cycle of poverty started after marijuana farming was banned in the country. Then the Maoist insurgency added to the woe, forcing youths to migrate. The signing of the peace agreement in 2006 didn’t herald any change in the economy either and youths are struggling to get jobs. Organised human traffickers are cashing in on this sorry state of affairs, Regmi said. “Meter byajis [usurious lenders] are also promoting this phenomenon,” he added.The phenomenon is equally rife in Dang’s Tulsipur and Ghorahi. Ramesh Kumar Pandey, chair of Ghorai-15, says that even though many heading to the US are swindled, no complaints are filed at the ward office. “Only those who attempt to go to Saudi Arabia or Qatar file the complaints,” he said.One can infer from Pandey’s statements that the families of such illegal travellers don’t want to publicise the ordeals of their family members. On the one hand, agents threaten them to not publicise the issue; on the other, they fear they themselves would be punished by law.According to the Anti-Human Trafficking Bureau, as many as 178 Nepalis, including 174 men, have been deported from the US in the five fiscal years after 2018-19. Of them, the highest 49 are from Rukum while 37 are from Dang. The data doesn’t include those who returned after making it to the half-way or those who have been fighting the legal battle in the US for refugee status. But this data is enough to show that many such youths are from the ‘base areas’ of the Maoist insurgency.SSP Jeevan Shrestha, chief of the bureau, said that data on the number of such victims and the amounts they have spent is hard to collect since complaints are rarely filed with the police. “This is human trafficking but for a lack of law, we are still compelled to launch the cases as per Human Trafficking and Transportation (Control) Act 2074 BS,” Shrestha said. “The Act provides a maximum penalty of Rs250,000 for the offenders and 50 percent of that as compensation to the victims.” Without specific law, police also invoke the theft and organised crime act to punish the offenders, he added.On the one hand, police receive no complaints; on the other, the phenomenon sees no control.Bhaskar Gautam, a political scientist, says the rise in cases of human trafficking in the insurgency’s ‘base areas’ is due to the political system’s abject failure.While the Maoists raised issues related to livelihood, nationalism and a new kind of democracy to fuel their war machine, after the peace process, it is livelihoods that have been hit the hardest, Gautam said. “The traditional way of life and economy took a hit during the insurgency,” he said. “Developments after the peace process also failed to address that. What sprang up was organised human trafficking.”(Mahesh KC in Rukum East and Durgalal KC in Dang contributed to this report.)This report is prepared in collaboration with the Center for Investigative Journalism-Nepal. \nGyanumaya BK had been suffering from severe backaches for a while. The resident of Pokhara-15, BK visited the Metrocity Hospital in Srijanachowk seeking treatment five months ago. The 69-year-old, who works as a labourer, has already spent over Rs50,000 on follow-up checkups and medications.BK spent eight days in the hospital in January and has been paying off loans she had taken to pay her bills and for follow-up visits to the hospital. Had BK been aware of the Health Facility Operation Standards-2020, which private hospitals must adhere to, she wouldn’t have had to borrow money to pay her medical bills. As per the regulations, hospitals must set aside 10 percent of their total beds to the underprivileged and needy.“I didn’t know hospitals were required to provide free treatment to those who can’t afford hospital stays,” BK said. “But even if I did, I would have to fight to get the service as the hospital won’t willingly offer me the service.”The Pokhara-based 50-bed hospital’s Chief Executive Officer Gyan Prasad Aryal admits that his hospital does not adhere to the mandate. “We don’t have explicit information from the health ministry on the Health Facility Operation Standards-2020,” said Aryal. “Moving forward, we will follow the instructions.” The hospital authorities say they give a 10-15 percent discount on the final hospital bill as opposed to dedicating 10 percent of their beds and free treatment and medications to the less privileged. Hospitals with 15 beds come under the jurisdiction of the local units while those with up to 50 beds fall under the ambit of the Provincial Health Directorate. Likewise, the Provincial Health Ministry oversees health facilities with over 50 beds.However, no regulatory body has data on whether health facilities are following government rules, especially Health Facility Operation Standards-2020. But it is an open secret that most private hospitals in Pokhara are not following the regulations.Pokhara Municipality Health Department Officer Yadunath Baral, Kaski District Health Officer Bhim Prasad Poudel, and Province Health Director Khim Bahadur Khadka all admit that local hospitals disregard the regulations. “Our monitoring and inspection is also lax, that’s why most hospitals ignore the rules,” he said. He says lack of manpower hampers effective inspection. “Our manpower is enough to conduct inspections in other districts, but not in Kaski, which has many private hospitals,” he said. “We need more people for that”. According to Baral, although the hospitals claim to offer a certain discount on final bills to the needy, they are unable to show the record of the discounts provided. “The hospitals claim they give discounts, but most hospitals have not even been able to show us the proof,” said Khadka. “Legal actions should be taken against the hospitals that fail to submit a monthly report on the free services for the poor. More importantly, they must be liable for flouting government standards that aim to benefit the poor.” The Provincial Health Directorate also does not have any data on the directive’s implementation at hospitals with more than 50 beds.The department’s chief of health services Dr Ramesh KC says that they have been working on updating information of health services in the Gandaki region. “Hospitals have failed to submit their mandatory monthly reports. We will seek that information when they come for new permits or permit renewal,” KC said. There are 27 privately-owned hospitals within the Pokhara Metropolitan City and 39 in the Gandaki region. Bharatpur Metropolitan City in Chitwan in Bagmati Province is also called the ‘medical city’  as it is home to 23 private hospitals with a total of 1,200 beds. Additionally, there are multiple large-scale government hospitals and two medical colleges—Chitwan Medical College and College of Medical Sciences—that also provide medical services. Had the Health Facility Operation Standards-2020 been followed by the 23 private hospitals, 120 patients would have received free health services every year, according to Durgadutta Chapagain, chief of the Chitwan Health Office.“Although the hospitals claim they provide the services, none have been able to provide convincing proof. Instead, we found them giving such discounts to patients who are close to hospital operators,” said Chapagain. “Our department validates the permits for new health facilities and re-registrations for hospitals with a 25-bed capacity. We have asked such public health service providers to put up posters or stickers reading ‘Discounts for the needy’ on the hospital premises so that patients know what services they can get on discount.”Meanwhile, Bikram Adhikari, Secretary of the Private Hospitals Coordination Committee in Chitwan, claims that the regulations are impractical. “There are a few services that hospitals can provide free of cost. You cannot expect hospitals to provide all services for free. That’s why there is a need to amend the existing regulations,” said Adhikari.The monitoring bodies’ inaction and lackadaisical approach to ensuring that public health services are accessible and affordable to all makes private hospitals blatantly ignore government mandates.Bharatpur Metropolitan City’s Deputy Mayor Chitrasen Adhikari says that although the metropolis is aware that private hospitals must allocate 10 percent of their beds for free treatment of poor people, the metropolis administration has yet to devise a monitoring mechanism. “We have not taken any steps towards that end, but we will soon,” he said.Just like Pokhara and Chitwan, Biratnagar is also plagued with the same problem. There are 32 private hospitals currently in operation in the metropolis. Deepak Bhattarai, statistical officer at the municipality’s health office, asserts that none of the health facilities met the set requirements. A monthly report submitted by the Biratnagar-based Nobel Medical College and Teaching Hospital, which has 750 beds, stated that the hospital had provided the said concession to more than 400 patients. “However, the report did not clarify how many of the 400 patients were provided free hospital beds and the services that come along with the beds, and how many were given discounts on their hospital bills,” Bhattarai said. “We found that hospital reports also include concessions provided to patients who sought outpatient, emergency, and X-ray services.”The hospital’s director Narayan Dahal claims to be following all government instructions. He says 10 percent hospital beds are set aside for needy patients who are not charged any treatment fees, while 10 percent of service seekers also get discounts.Although the Biratnagar Metropolis has directed all health facilities under its jurisdiction to allocate free beds and provide free services to the needy, inform service seekers about the government-provided services, and submit a list of all patients who have received the services, the directive is ignored more often than followed. According to Bhattarai, medical establishments must get a letter from the local unit before making any upgrades or purchasing any equipment. “But the hospitals have been found presenting fake documents in order to acquire such permits,” he said. “The metropolis has refused such permits to 12 private hospitals in the current fiscal year.”Butwal Sub-Metropolitan City in the Lumbini Province has also taken no concrete step to ensure private hospitals adhere to Health Facility Operation Standards-2020. Despite having the authority to carry out inspections, the sub-metropolis’ apathy has deprived hundreds of needy patients of various government services. The sub-metropolis with 17 wards has more than two dozen big hospitals in the Butwal bazaar area itself. Not one of them adheres to the government’s health regulations. But the sub-metropolis is yet to monitor these hospitals. Yubraj Pandey, chief of Butwal Sub Metropolitan’s health department, says they have been unable to inspect medical institutes due to a lack of a proper set of rules.“I have just been transferred here. Discussions are underway to prepare legal requirements,” he said. Private hospitals in Butwal only began filing their reports two months ago after a joint meeting, informs Chief of the Sub Metropolitan’s Education and Health Department Mitramani Khanal. Twenty-year-old Suraj BK of Sarawal Rural Municipality-2 in West Nawalparasi got into a motorcycle accident on April 26. He suffered injuries on both his legs and was taken to Zenus Hospital and Research Centre in Butwal. Suraj was handed a bill of Rs 70,000 for treatment but he did not have the money to clear the bill and sought the hospital’s help. “The hospital refused to provide any discount. They in fact refused to discharge me. I got my discharge papers only four days later after I paid almost Rs 100,000,” he said. “I had to get a loan to pay the hospital bills as my father, who is a farmer, did not have that kind of money.”Dr Sharda Singh, the hospital director, said Suraj did not qualify for a discount as he did not have a recommendation letter from the local unit. “Patients have to get a recommendation to avail of free services at private hospitals but Suraj could not bring one,” she said. “I was in the hospital bed for four days. I could not have secured a recommendation from the local unit in that state,” said Suraj. Ishwari Prasad Chapagain, a civil society leader of Rupandehi and a member of the Consumer Interest Protection Forum, says private hospitals in Butwal are more interested in making money than helping those in need. “They do not follow government mandates. They act as if they have to bear the expenses of providing free service to the poor when in fact they get tax rebates and such for such services,” he said. “The sub-metropolis also does not do the needful. Everyone is corrupt including the city officials.”  \nThe one lesson Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal seems to have forgotten even as he indulged in all manners of chicanery and machinations to stay in power was the simplest—two can play the same game. In his case, it was actually three but the end result was the same. For a public long wearied of his constant restlessness and the promise of even more instability, the universal reaction to the Oli-Deuba gang up against Dahal was either studied indifference or a feeling that justice has been served.To now be known as the ‘Duplicitous One’ is a big step down from the ‘Fierce One’, the translation of his nom de guerre most commonly used in the heady days when Dahal had just entered mainstream politics. And rather than admit that he had been beaten at his own game, the prime minister has been on a whine, even singing a song about betrayal in love. Most of all, though, warning yet again that regressive forces were becoming active.No record to whine aboutOne just wonders if Dahal(and his minions) now going to town about how the incoming alliance will take the country backward even pause to consider his own record. From engaging in mindless politicking to donning the daura-suruwal to complete his metamorphosis from revolutionary leader to an ordinary politician, what has he done to advance the cause of progressivism that is substantially different from other governments?Since the issue of ‘inclusion’ is one that the Maoists, somewhat justifiably, can be proprietorial over, let us take the case of the different constitutional commissions aimed specifically at furthering that objective. Under ‘Other Commissions’, the 2015 Constitution has provisioned for the National Women Commission, the National Dalit Commission, and the National Inclusion Commission. Following these three are the Adibasi Janajati Commission, the Madheshi Commission, the Tharu Commission, and the Muslim Commission.Why the latter four were not designated as ‘national’ beats reason as does why Tharus were granted a separate commission since, by law, Tharus are also part of the larger Adibasi Janajati grouping. Equally so, why there was no indication of what these ‘non-national’ commissions were to do. Grafted as they were into the draft of the constitution in the wake of the horrific Tikapur incident of August 2015, the political parties were in such a great hurry to assuage those with serious misgivings with the draft constitution that they simply declared that there shall be such-and-such commissions and left it at that. Granted, the Maoists did not have much bargaining heft back in 2015. But they could at least have called for a more comprehensive copy-and-paste job with regard to these commissions. Not that it would have mattered one whit since, over time, all the commissions, ‘national’ or otherwise, have been given nearly the same reduced responsibilities as well as shrinking authority. And, the Maoists have played along without demur. To top it off, even though Dahal has headed the government for the past year and a half, the resource crunch in these commissions, both human and financial, remained wholly unaddressed. These commissions will all be facing an existential threat next year since a review is a constitutional requirement. With barely anything to show over the years, it should come as no surprise if the commissions were written out of the constitution. But it is more likely that the Maoists and other parties will follow the politically expedient path of letting them toothlessly exist as they are.Three ole menHaving said that, we do wonder what kind of political system we live under. All the goings and comings among and between the three major parties, the Nepali Congress, the UML and the Maoists, can hardly be called that. For it was not engagement among parties but just individuals. It is absolutely amazing that for each party, the president alone can decide the way forward. And the office-bearers elected and nominated are then left scrambling for post-facto justifications of their leader’s actions they mostly had no inkling about.Hence, Sher Bahadur Deuba felt no need to take into confidence the party leadership when he decided to back away from the pre-poll understanding with Dahal on who would first lead the government back in 2022. Neither did KP Sharma Oli feel the need to explain to his cadre why he preferred a, b or c as the presidential candidate over x, y and z. Dahal being the self-styled disruptor and heading a party new to democratic politics, obviously would not deign to take anyone’s advice for anything. He now finds no one but himself to blame for the unsavoury situation he has led his party into. The tragedy is that the entire country is being held hostage to the whims of these three men and is likely to be so well into the future.Country doing fineThese men’s efforts to hold back Nepal notwithstanding, we seem to be doing somewhat fine. As mentioned in an earlier piece, national poverty rates have shrunk despite the political dysfunction of the past decade. By one reckoning of the World Bank, measured against the ‘International Poverty Line’ of a per capita income of USD 2.15 per day, poverty has made an exit from Nepal. We will let the economists quibble over these numbers but the fact remains that in spite of the politics, the country is not doing so badly.I would even argue that our democratic space remains open precisely because of the unstable politics we complain so much about. It cannot be just the role of the national character or other such attributes that Nepal is the most open in the region. Just look at the neighbourhood. Each country is in the grip of either a strongman (India, and, till recently, Sri Lanka), or a strongwoman (Bangladesh), or an undemocratic institution (Afghanistan, Myanmar and Pakistan). Our man Oli did try to pull a stunt a la Erdoğan/Orbán/Modi on us when he headed the most powerful government in Nepal’s modern history. But his ambition was cut short by, at times, the force of civil society opposition and, at others, an alert judiciary. We do not know if Oli has tempered his autocratic instincts since. Coalition politics will certainly keep them at abeyance for now. Until the next election, that is. The real test of his and of other leaders will be if they were to lead their party into an emphatic victory. Will we then follow the path of so many other countries of sliding into some form of electoral autocracy? Or will our civil and political institutions be strong enough to withstand any such attempt to undermine them? I am betting on the latter and hoping against hope that I am right. \nAs Iran’s President-elect, Masoud Pezeshkian, continues to receive congratulatory calls from global leaders, he is due to hold discussions with foreign counterparts from July 8, with a swearing-in before the Parliament not scheduled before the first week of August. This does not seem to prevent senior Iranian diplomats from supporting Pezeshkian’s policies (from engaging the West to Afghan refugees, which was a focal point of discussion during the elections). That said, it remains unclear as to how the conservative political regime will respond to his policies, with one scholar referring to over two interactions with the Ayatollah, speculating Pezeshkian to have received some directions/guidance on the same. On enquiring over Pezeshkian’s interaction with the Ayatollah, one IRGC commander acknowledged Pezeshkian received direction to continue the foreign policy initiatives of his predecessor, the late former president Ebrahim Raisi, without naming the Ayatollah. It may be too early to predict the potential prospect of Pezeshkian’s Middle East policy or future efforts to renew Iran-West diplomacy with a neighbouring Taliban, but we witness some excitement within the Rahbari Shura, with members enthusiastically watching this political transition.Afghan migration post-Taliban ruleAs the third year of Taliban rule comes to a close, Afghans continue to apply—in large numbers—for migration to Iran, a pattern which appears to have grown since 2021. According to a source close to Khalil Haqqani (the acting Minister of Refugees), citizens (by hundreds) continue to stand in line outside the Ministry of Refugee and Repatriation in Kabul, seeking permission to leave the country.With the Islamic Republic of Iran topping the list of countries hosting Afghan refugees since the Taliban rule, Iran’s Permanent Representative to the United Nations, Ambassador Amir Saeed Iravani, during a Security Council session on June 21, reflected the reality. He stated that Iran has hosted over 6 million Afghan refugees till date. In what appeared to be a call for global support on the fate of Afghan Refugees, he argued that the Afghan refugees cost over $10 billion annually for sanctioned-struck Iran. With economic challenges and sanctions drastically sinking Iran’s economy, this amount may be phenomenal, with thousands of Afghan refugees waiting to flee.Tehran’s approach to Afghan refugeesThe fate of Afghan refugees in Iran and Tehran’s approach to resolving the refugee crisis may appear to be pertinent as questions, but they receive occasional responses from Tehran. The future of millions of Afghans living in despicable conditions throughout Iran raises questions on the sheer absence of housing, medical care, education, reunification of families (living within various camps), citizenship, access to bank accounts, or right to work, among other basic facilities, in the background of sheer ambiguous occasional responses from the Tehranian political class. To the Iranian public, the presence of Afghan migrants living in Tehran is a significant cause of concern, as expressed roughly by every scholar we interviewed. Unlike nations with dedicated migration frameworks/programmes/initiatives formulated by state humanitarian entities, Iran lacks a migration policy. This reflects local Iranians’ sentiment towards Afghan migrants, forcing Tehran to maintain some distance from the issue, creating a policy vacuum. Devoid of social interaction/societal integration, the Afghan migrants continue to be viewed with great suspicion, forcing local authorities to deny them even basic amenities and access to decent living.A hope from Pezeshkian?In many economies, migrant/refugee policies have always found their way through the electoral process. They did so, even in Iran’s conservative political system, with presidential candidates arguing on the issue of migrants. During the presidential race, Mohammad Ghalibaf and Pezeshkian emphasised the need to seriously address the Afghan refugee issue, at least in their campaign, garnering greater interaction/engagement over the problem. However, it remains ignored and occasionally answered by Tehran when asked by South Asian/Western scholars.Reflecting on Pezeshkian’s presidential campaign, we decided to predict that President-elect Pezeshkian's refugee policy—which remains unclear due to the Ayatollah’s constant guidance (according to one scholar)—may vary from closing the eastern borders with Afghanistan and Pakistan to mass deportation of refugees to a dedicated refugee agreement with the Taliban government or creating a dedicated Afghan refugee policy without alienating the Taliban. Those close to Pezeshkian reflected some positive outcomes to the Afghan refugee issue since “the President-elect aims to formulate a multi-dimensional approach to counter illegal foreign nationals”, according to a source who advises him on migrant issues.According to a Tehran-based scholar, Pezeshkian may call for a complete border closure, taking a harsher stand on migration in the first few weeks of his presidency. Although the President-elect discussed the challenges to migration and the influx of refugees (in Europe) with European leaders, it is highly likely for him to request that EU leaders accept some refugees if the Israeli hostage negotiations between the US and Hamas conclude successfully. It would not be incorrect to credit Pezeshkian on his positive reflection towards Afghan refugees, which, according to him, would play a positive/progressive role in Iran’s development, terming their contribution as constructive to the country’s growth.With the elections over and Pezeshkian yet to take office, the issue of Afghan refugees (which took precedence during his election campaign) may take a back seat, at least until August.A dedicated Afghan refugee policy?Without a doubt, the President-elect aims to govern refugees, and he understands the challenges of shutting down the border. Unlike his counterpart, he has drawn lessons from Trump’s Mexico Wall or the stricter stance of right-wing policymakers in Europe. It remains unclear whether his government would formulate a dedicated refugee policy (even one dedicated to Afghan refugees), carrying the risk of alienating either his voters, regime loyalists, Ayatollah himself or the Taliban.Pezeshkian’s first few months of the presidency will focus on the Gaza War, sanctioned hit economy, increasing unemployment and depleting workforce, not on the Afghan refugee crisis. Nonetheless, he could initiate policies and programmes to integrate Afghan refugees into a constructive role in Iran. The argument of a refugee policy/migrant reform dedicated to Afghan refugees appears far-fetched, but the President-elect may allow them to contribute to Iran’s economic development and infrastructural growth and also guarantee better housing, healthcare and access to better living.That said, decisions about the fate of Afghan refugees are made at levels higher than the legislative branch (executive under the guidance of the Supreme Leader), which the President-elect Pezeshkian cannot substantially change even as a policy. Though he may bring minor alterations in such a scenario, a fundamental change is but ideal. \nThe 2015 Constitution marked a significant milestone in Nepal’s political history. Its formal implementation began with the election of the three levels of government—federal, provincial and local—in 2017. As Nepal enters a new phase of its political evolution, it is an opportune moment to consider necessary amendments to the constitution to strengthen federalism and democracy. The Post also published an editorial titled 'Easy does it' this Monday, highlighting the complexities involved in this process. The Nepali Congress and the Communist Party of Nepal (UML), the two major political parties, claim to have agreed to amend the constitution. If so, this is a positive step toward addressing critical governance issues. However, alliances and agreements between these major parties are precarious and prone to change, threatening political stability. There are talks of forming a national consensus government and amending the constitution, but the possibility and impact of such an endeavour remain questionable.Nine years after its promulgation, the constitution’s shortcomings and inconsistencies have become evident. A severe review of the constitution's implementation is necessary, and reforms and amendments must address these issues. The constitution should be seen as a dynamic and living document, not merely a source of problems. This approach emphasises continuous improvement to reflect the evolving political and social environment.A good constitution alone does not ensure good governance; it requires competent, sincere and committed leaders. The constitution issued by the Constituent Assembly is certainly an improvement over previous versions, but its implementation has been slow. Provincial and local governments have struggled to exercise the rights granted by the constitution. For instance, the constitution assigns provinces the exclusive right to exercise police powers, but this has not been allowed in practice.Frequent changes in power have caused dissatisfaction among citizens. While the United States has maintained the same federal constitution and governance system for over two centuries, Switzerland has had the same federal system for 176 years, Canada for 157 years, and India for 74 years. These countries have undergone repeated constitutional reforms to ensure stability. In contrast, Nepal has seen numerous changes in its governance system and constitution.Federalism is the cornerstone of Nepal's constitution. The issue lies not in the constitution itself but in its implementation by the rulers. Instead of addressing constitutional loopholes, leaders have exacerbated them. Reforms in the electoral system are essential to achieving stability and a better federal governance system. Nepal’s mixed electoral system has led to coalition governments. While some people lament that small parties play disproportional roles in the coalition culture, a coalition of diverse parties can also bring more comprehensive ideas and solutions for the country’s development. However, individual interests have often taken precedence over national interests, leading to a lack of collective accountability. Therefore, reform of the electoral system is inevitable.A significant debate revolves around whether to reduce the seats allocated for proportional representation in the House of Representatives. The proportional representation system was designed to ensure fair representation for women, Dalits and marginalised communities. Removing this system altogether, or even reducing its weightage, without addressing the underlying issues of representation, would be inappropriate and counterproductive. The fault lies not in the electoral system but in the political leadership that constantly changes alliances.Some politicians and analysts have proposed direct election of the Prime Minister and Chief Minister, which could lead to more stable governments. This change would require making parliamentary elections entirely proportional, ensuring that MPs focus on law-making and government oversight. They also propose reforming the structure of the provinces, as the current federal system does not appear to function effectively. Reducing the number of Members of Parliament (MPs) is necessary. The House of Representatives (HoR) currently has 275 seats, and the Provincial Assemblies together have 550 seats. The large size of the HoR and the provincial assemblies has resulted in huge expenses. The first-past-the-post (FPTP) voting system should ensure that everyone is directly elected, and the number of MPs should be adjusted accordingly. Reducing the number of MPs elected through the proportional electoral system—currently 110 in the HoR and 220 in the provincial assemblies—will also address the high costs associated with federalism. However, in the FPTP system, those elected via the proportional electoral system, such as women, Dalits and other marginalised communities, should be addressed with reserved constituencies. In such cases, elections should be held exclusively within these groups.The proportional electoral system is not inherently flawed. However, it has often benefited those with political connections or financial influence. To address this, proportional candidates should be elected based on joint votes from political parties and candidates, ensuring the people approve them. Amendments should include fixing the tenure of the Prime Minister, similar to the President and local level heads, who have two tenures. The PM should not serve more than two terms. Limiting MPs from becoming ministers can also reduce political corruption. Reducing the number of ministers is crucial; the current provision for up to 25 ministers is excessive. With the provincial and local levels taking more responsibilities, the number of ministries at the federal level should be reduced by half.Nepal's federal system must also streamline the number of departments and ministries. Many existing departments play insignificant roles and should be abolished or transferred to provinces. Stability at the provincial level is another critical issue. Frequent changes of Chief Ministers have led to public discontent. Direct elections for Chief Ministers can enhance accountability and stability. The constitution should be amended to allow the Vice President to become the Chairperson of the National Assembly. This will reduce additional expenses and enhance the role and effectiveness of the National Assembly.Amending the constitution requires a two-thirds majority in both houses of Parliament, which the Congress and the UML alone cannot achieve. Forming a national consensus government is necessary to garner the required support. However, significant contradictions among the parties on constitutional issues make it challenging to reach a consensus. These contradictions need to be addressed through dialogue and compromise to move forward effectively.The constitution outlines formal roles and duties and expects certain behaviour from political and institutional actors. Political parties, leadership, parliament, judiciary and constitutional bodies must establish actions aligned with the constitution's essence. Without this alignment, politics cannot gain people’s trust, and the Constitution becomes merely a tool for gaining power.Judicial reforms are also crucial for constitutional stability. The constitution must be amended to address these issues comprehensively. Disillusionment and mistrust towards political leadership and politics in general are prevalent. This sentiment stems from the opportunism of political leaders rather than the constitution and the system. We need a new generation of leaders who can feel the changing aspirations of society and maintain relevance in politics. Leadership should focus on long-term national interests rather than short-term personal gains.Nepal stands at a crossroads where constitutional amendments can pave the way for a more stable and prosperous future. The collaboration between major political parties and the lessons from international experiences underscore the importance of these reforms. By addressing the current challenges and ensuring proportional inclusive representation, Nepal can strengthen its federalism and democracy, fulfilling the aspirations of its people.Finally, amending the constitution alone will not solve the problems unless it is accompanied by a change in political culture and leaders’ attitudes and actions. Political stability and effectiveness depend on the commitment of political actors to uphold the principles of the constitution and work towards the common good. This holistic approach is essential for ensuring the constitution remains a robust and guiding document for the nation’s future. \nAs much as we love the monsoon for its greenery and promise of a bountiful harvest, we dread floods, landslides and diseases. As in years past, disasters have wreaked havoc in several parts of Nepal this year too, leading to at least 70 deaths since June. Adding to the woes are vector- and water-borne diseases, such as viral fever, diarrhoea, dysentery, food poisoning, typhoid, dengue and kala-azar, turning the season into a time of epidemics. The Epidemiology and Disease Control Division has already warned doctors and the public of possible uptick in incidents of these diseases.In 2022, as a result of contaminated water, Kathmandu Valley saw an outbreak of cholera, with 77 positive cases reported. The same year, diarrheal diseases affected hundreds of people for many months. Just last month, a patient tested positive for the Vibrio cholerae 01 Ogawa serotype at the Sukraraj Tropical and Infectious Disease Hospital, of which the authorities were reportedly unaware, as per a Post report. This is not a good sign, as many cases usually go unreported because people don’t visit hospitals unless there’s an emergency, and a lack of investigation from the government means no awareness about the possible spread of cholera. Such negligence about a deadly disease will only fuel its spread.Moreover, the dengue outbreak in the country has gone out of hand over the years. According to official records, the virus has circulated to 73 districts, infecting almost 1,500 people since January. What is concerning is that these numbers could go up, as we aren’t even halfway through this monsoon, and the dengue virus lasts until post-monsoon. Additionally, climate change and rising temperatures have pushed the disease even into the winter season. Recently, health experts have also been worried about the possible instances of the Zika virus (similar to dengue) in Nepal, as cases are being detected in the southern neighbour India. The outbreaks of these diseases and their prolonged presence can easily drain the healthcare facilities of an under-resourced country like ours. In the monsoon crisis, the poor and vulnerable suffer the most, as their condition is compounded by contaminated water, floods, landslides, and other monsoon-related disasters. This not only affects their treatment-seeking behaviour but also their ability to adopt preventive measures, which could in turn lead to community-level transmission of diseases.The Epidemic and Outbreak Surveillance of the Ministry of Health is tasked with collecting data on diseases, informing the general public, and encouraging policymakers to take necessary actions against outbreaks and make people aware of them. Moreover, it also regularly monitors drinking water quality and does surveillance of water-borne diseases. In recent months, it has found harmful substances like faecal coliform in bottled water and even tap water in some places in the Kathmandu Valley. These findings suggest the surveillance and monitoring mechanism in the country has to be strengthened, and local units around the country should be made responsible for keeping their water resources safe throughout the year, especially during the monsoon, to prevent possible outbreaks of water-borne diseases. In the case of vector-borne dengue, Zika and chikungunya viruses, a year-round door-to-door search and destruction of mosquito breeding areas is a must.Nepal has been dealing with monsoon maladies for decades. Our healthcare system should proactively allocate human, infrastructural and budgetary resources to combat these monsoon epidemics and prevent unnecessary loss of life and a whole lot of suffering.  \nThe monsoon has been causing havoc right across Nepal in the past couple of days. At least 70 people have been killed in floods, landslides and other monsoon-related disasters since June 10, according to the Nepal Police. Five others were missing and 86 people were injured in water-induced disasters over a month. There must have been many other incidents not included in official records. The monsoon entered Nepal from its eastern part in the second week of June. Heavy rainfalls that caused huge damage in Bagmati, Gandaki and Lumbini provinces until Sunday, wreaked havoc in far-western Nepal on Monday.As a country with over 83 percent of its land covered by hills and mountains, Nepal is always at the risk of landslides and floods mainly in the monsoon period. Similarly, people in the southern belt are tormented by inundation. Monsoon-related disasters are a yearly occurrence. The Monsoon Preparedness and Response Plan 2024 estimated that over 412,000 households may be affected and of them over 83,000 are likely to be badly hit by monsoon-related disasters this season. In a decade between April 2014 to April 2024, there were 1,602 recorded floods and 2,840 landslides. At least 3,052 people were killed, 791 went missing and 4,176 were injured in the period, according to the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Authority. Similarly, 16,054 buildings and other structures were damaged. This shows the magnitude of the losses caused by monsoon-related disasters in the country.As heavy rains have battered almost all parts of the country, a large number of people have been struggling to deal with the disasters. Besides deaths, missing and injuries, thousands have been displaced and taking shelter in nearby places. In such times, saving lives by rescuing people trapped in difficult situations should be the government’s first priority. Logically, what follows is shifting people from disaster-prone areas to safer places, swiftly distributing reliefs and working on a plan to rehabilitate the displaced. Though our three security agencies often do a commendable job of saving people’s lives, they are still not well-equipped. Just months ago, some of them died while trying to contain wildfires. Rescuers should be equipped with better gears and other logistics before they set out on rescue missions. Moreover, relief distribution and rehabilitation works often court controversy either because of substandard quality of the goods distributed, or the irregularities while carrying out the task.When it comes to rehabilitating flood victims, our state agencies have utterly failed. Thousands of people have been languishing in either nearby forest areas, on riverbanks or other unsafe places for years where they had supposedly been shifted for a few months. For instance, floods in Koshi in August 2008 displaced 7,563 families from the present-day Shreepur, Haripur, and West Kushaha, located across different wards of Koshi Rural Municipality. But they are still living in makeshift huts and mud houses as the government has failed to properly rehabilitate them in the past 16 years. The Koshi Flood Victims Struggle Committee is fighting for their basic rights. A state that cannot ensure the basic safety of its citizens, we are afraid, has gotten its priorities badly wrong.    \nThe text of the midnight deal last Monday whereby the Nepali Congress and the CPN-UML agreed to stitch together a new coalition remains hidden, giving rise to much speculation. Yet while talking about the deal, the leaders of the two parties have pointed to the necessity of a ‘national consensus’ government in order to address the country’s pressing problems. This, they say, entails amending the nine-year-old national constitution. Even if the country’s two largest parties come together, they will fall short of a two-thirds majority needed to amend the constitution in the federal lower House. Had they the numbers in the lower chamber, they would have fallen short in the upper House. To amend the constitution, the ruling parties ought to have two-thirds majority in both. This is why many analysts reckon the constitution amendment is no more than an excuse to justify the toppling of the Pushpa Kamal Dahal government. That is unfortunate. The biggest architects of the national charter cannot be so cavalier when it comes to its amendment.The other suspicion is that in pushing for constitution amendment, the two big parties want to significantly reduce the number of proportional representation seats in the two Houses. The reasoning is that the PR seats have allowed many smaller political outfits to enter parliament and to bargain for power with the big parties, thus contributing to political instability. The Congress and the UML also seemingly want to capitalise on the perception that the PR seats are mostly reserved for those close to powerful party chairs rather than for members of the marginalised and under-represented communities, as was envisioned in the constitution. Whatever the case, they should tread carefully. Despite all its flaws, the PR system has significantly increased the political representation of marginalised communities and groups and it would be dangerous to fiddle with it without their buy-in. There is also no guarantee a fully FPTP system will ensure stability. Even before the new constitution came into effect in 2015, not a single government, each one of them formed through direct elections, came close to serving out its full term. This again points to the need for broad consultations—and not a little introspection on the part of our top leaders. A living document that is the constitution can and should be amended on a timely basis, or it becomes irrelevant. But hastily tweaking it could invite more problems than it would solve. It is interesting that many of the high-ranking Congress and UML leaders were unaware of the Monday deal even an hour before it was signed. It is thus hard to believe that the points of agreement were much discussed even inside the two parties, much less in the broader society. For far too long, the leaders of the big parties have treated the apparatus of government pretty much as their personal property. The biggest reason the new federal republican system has not functioned as intended is their sense of entitlement, lack of accountability, and paucity of faith in the system they have themselves championed in public. Unless there is a change in this mindset, no system of governance or election will yield the desired results.  \nThe Nepali Congress and the CPN-UML last week reached an agreement to form a coalition government under the leadership of UML chair KP Sharma Oli. As a part of the package, they also aim to make certain changes to the constitution. The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal asked Pradeep Gyawali, deputy general secretary of UML, the reasons behind the coming together of the two largest parties, how they plan to run the government and to review and amend the constitution.Many are seeing the Congress-UML alliance as something unusual. What factors brought the two largest parties together even as there is no crisis-like situation or a special task such as constitution writing?Definitely, in normal parliamentary practice, the two largest parties don’t forge an alliance to run a government. The party that gets the biggest mandate leads the government, and the other big party remains in the opposition to make the ruling force accountable. In Nepal, the country’s two major forces, the Congress and the UML, have also joined hands in certain junctures for certain purposes. They worked together to make the constitution in 1990, to conduct general elections in 1999, to complete transition after the 2006 people’s movement and to bring out the constitution in 2015. We felt a need for a similar collaboration this time around. After the November 2022 elections, we saw three alliances in our parliament. At first, Maoist Centre chair Pushpa Kamal Dahal became prime minister with our support, but he failed to abide by the agreement sincerely. He changed the coalition within a month. The subsequent alliance between the Congress and the Maoist Centre lasted for a year. He again sought the UML’s support. Within four months of the March 4 deal with the UML, he started yet another gameplan to join hands with the Congress under the pretext of forming a national consensus government. It was quite unusual for the prime minister himself to instigate instability in the government. He publicly boasted that he had a ‘magical number’ [32 seats in the House of Representatives]. He thought that he could employ the tactic of ‘use and throw’ with the two largest parties and rule the country for the full term. He was completely indifferent to people’s plight, the country’s pressing issues and service delivery. This was the height of irresponsibility. So, the UML and Congress leaders concluded that the time had come to intervene to ensure political stability and service delivery and make sure public frustration doesn’t get out of hand. Did external factors play a role? Recent statements by UML leaders suggest that the party has taken it seriously. When national forces are weak, the neighbouring countries and international forces become more cautious, even more so given Nepal’s geo-political situation. Some of their concerns are valid. They fear political instability in Nepal may have an adverse impact on their genuine issues. We have to take this naturally. Second, it is no secret that we have a long legacy of facing external interference. Sometimes such interventions are carried out covertly and sometimes overtly. Therefore, national forces should be strong. Some political parties and leaders have a tendency of seeking external forces’ support to fulfil their vested interests. In return, they serve the external forces’ undue interests. Formation of a government is a purely domestic affair, but in our case sometimes it also becomes an issue of geopolitical interest. It is said that the UML was spooked when it learned that Prime Minister Dahal had reportedly approached the Congress for a new alliance. This reportedly happened after Dahal returned from New Delhi following Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s swearing-in.We were taken by surprise when the Congress leaders told us that the prime minister had reached out to them with a proposal to form a national consensus government. We were informed about the development from the leaders of the main opposition party. When we reached the March 4 deal with the prime minister, we thought he came to us with a commitment to course correction. Based on that, we supported him almost unconditionally. We didn’t bargain while sharing ministerial portfolios and didn’t talk about the prime minister’s term. We had even thought of allowing Dahal to run the government for the full term if the government functioned well and people were satisfied. We hadn’t even imagined that we would have to think about changing the coalition within four months.We definitely had certain grievances such as a lack of consultation with our party and our lawmakers while preparing the government’s policies and programmes and while allocating budget. Our party chair brought up this issue with the prime minister. But our concerns weren’t addressed. They had already started to ignore us. There were several issues with the prime minister, but we were committed to the partnership. But they had already gone too far. Fortunately, the Congress leaders didn’t accept the offer and instead raised critical questions about the rationale behind the proposal. Basically, the Congress didn’t trust Prachanda ji [Dahal] and came to us. It concluded that Dahal didn’t come with the intent of solving the country’s problems but to manoeuvre between the Congress and the UML.Besides jointly running the government, constitution amendment is another major aspect of the latest Congress-UML deal. What are the provisions the parties want to change?There are four major objectives of this agreement. Safeguarding national interest; strengthening economy; improving governance and service delivery; and ensuring political stability. A debate has started that some constitutional provisions are not helping maintain political stability. What we have said is that it’s been almost a decade since the promulgation of this constitution. Some of its provisions are yet to be implemented. On the other hand, provincial governments complain that they have not been able to work in a full-fledged way because the federal government has still not made some laws they need. So, first, we will undertake a comprehensive review on the progress in the course of implementing the constitution and the challenges we faced in the past decade, among other things. While doing so, we will find out if there are provisions that have posed challenges in maintaining political stability and running a stable government and suggest amendments accordingly.So, it’s not only about the amendment but also about review, assessment and recommendation for amendment, if there is a need. Even if the amendment process begins, it will be limited to ensuring political stability and won’t touch other aspects of the statute. There is no need to over-react. For instance, some Maoist leaders are trying to make it a political issue by describing it as a regressive move. That is wrong.So as per the two-party deal, the statute will be reviewed but not necessarily amended?Yes, whether to go for amendments will depend on the findings of the review. No constitution in the world is perfect. Its success largely depends on the practitioners. So, first we have to differentiate between the role of the constitution and the practitioners. It is true that our society is divided over certain provisions of our constitution. All these issues will be considered, but the fundamental features of the constitution such as democracy, inclusion and federalism won’t be altered. Our priority would be to only remove hindrances in making the system more functional, people-oriented and productive.Of late, people are debating the electoral system, provincial structure and secularism. Will these issues also be dealt with?Federalism is a new system for us. In fact, it is still an in-the-making process in Nepal. We have to note some timelines while analysing the performance of provinces. After the provincial and federal elections in 2017, the first provincial governments were formed in 2018, and they worked for around three years in a stable way. With small cabinets, they worked genuinely to strengthen the provincial system. At the time, most provincial cabinets had around six to seven ministers. They weren’t severely criticised at the time. The wrong trends in the provinces started with the division of the then Nepal Communist Party and the fall of the NCP-led governments at the centre as well as provinces. We saw the trend of horse-trading in provinces. Small parties made unjustified bargaining for ministerial portfolios, chief ministers started splitting ministries and increasing the number of ministers in their cabinets. Also, the November 2022 polls again gave a fragmented verdict, further augmenting the instability and anomalies at the provincial level. So, the problem is the way we are handling things more than the provincial structures. The time isn’t ripe to seek an alternative to the provinces. As far as the electoral model is concerned, we included proportional electoral (PR) system after long debates and discussions. Based on three general elections held after 1990, a conclusion was drawn that the first-past-the-post (FPTP) model couldn’t properly represent the historically under-represented sections. The premise is still valid. Based on the achievements, we may exclude certain communities from the list. But that time hasn’t come. Two questions raised over the use of PR are valid. Is the system really doing justice to the strata and class of the society for which it was introduced? This is the question not about the PR system but the leaders who use it. Similarly, some questions: Is proportional representation required in executive as well because representation is basically vital for policy making? The forms and modalities of the PR system might be discussed, but no one has even thought of removing the inclusive system.Similar is the case with secularism. The spirit is to make the state patron of all religions in the country. However, some sections of society have often tried to misuse and misinterpret the new constitutional provision. They try to interpret secularism as openly allowing rampant religious conversion, and some have made it an excuse to attack the age-old Sanatan faith. For instance, if the President or prime minister visits Lumbini, gurudwara or a shrine of any other faith on certain occasions, that is taken positively, but when they visit Pashupatinath Temple, a section of people raise questions. These activities have made some people think that these attacks on our Sanatan faith are taking place because of the secular system. There is no problem in the constitutional provision because the statute added an explanatory note that states, “‘secular’ means religious, cultural freedoms, including protection of religion and culture handed down from time immemorial.” But some extremist activities have given wrong impressions.Some experts believe the problem of fragmented mandate can be addressed by increasing the threshold required for a political party to be eligible to get PR seats, which can be done by amending laws. Will the Congress-UML alliance opt for this?Yes, this is one feasible option. I am in favour of this. As per the existing provision, a political party can secure seats under the PR category by securing 3 percent votes in the federal parliament and 1.5 percent votes in provincial assemblies. If a political organisation doesn’t even represent 5 or 7 or 10 percent of the population, what can they contribute to the country? You do politics to represent a sizable population and get a public mandate. Otherwise, the presence of such groups would only promote unreasonable bargaining and instigate instability in governments. This can be one of the agenda of the discussion between the two parties.This time, leaders have made it transparent that chiefs of the two parties will lead the government on a rotational basis. But why have other details of the agreement not been made public?There hasn’t been topic-wise discussions on specific provisions. The broader understanding is to review and assess the implementation aspect of the constitution and move ahead based on the findings of the assessment. We have also made it clear that such an act will be guided only by the objective of ensuring political stability and we will not go beyond that. Who will undertake this type of constitution review?We haven’t worked on it in detail. We haven’t reached any understanding. Naturally, inputs will be taken from the constitution makers, experts on constitutional law and politicians involved in this field. But no decision has been made on its nitty-gritty.The Rastriya Prajatantra Party that wants to revive the Hindu kingdom was the first party to welcome the Congress-UML deal while the Maoist Centre has accused Congress and UML of making a regressive move. So don’t you think this affair is tricky?I don’t think the political parties will touch the issues that the RPP talks about, such as reinstatement of Hindu kingdom and dissolution of federalism. No one is thinking about that. Also, the questions raised by the Maoist leaders have no meaning. They are only trying to make a political agenda.It also seems that the Congress and the UML floated this idea of reviewing the constitution to make a case for the two largest parties to form the government.That’s not true. This question undermines the spirit of this agreement. If this system fails, people will raise questions mainly to the leaders of the Congress and the UML, not Prachanda. It’s not only about running the government. We were already in the government and it isn’t a big deal for the Congress to return to power. If democracy fails, the democratic forces will lose the most. So we are genuinely working on this. The Congress and the UML are historical rival forces in Nepali politics. How can the two work together in government?It is true that the Congress and the UML are the two major competitors of this country. But we have some converging factors. First, we both believe in a broader democratic framework. Sometimes, the Congress may give more emphasis on liberal values while we may push for more socialism-oriented programmes. But the common ground is democratic values. We also have the experience of successfully carrying out certain tasks jointly. We may have some friction but we also have experience of managing bitter intra-party fighting as well as inter-party rivalry.How will the ministerial portfolios be shared in the new coalition?We haven’t reached any agreement in detail. As we aim to make this a ‘national consensus government’ we are in favour of accommodating other parties. So it will depend on the number of parties that join the Cabinet. Our only concern is that ministerial allocations should be done in a way that doesn’t weaken the prime minister in order to ensure that the head of the government can deliver.How can a government without the Maoist Centre and some other parties be called a consensus government?We have to wait for that. Leaders of political parties that fiercely criticise the government also join the Cabinet under one or other pretext. Some political parties seemingly cannot exist without being in the government.  \nOver half of students in Nepal failed the Secondary Education Examinations due to the introduction of a non-graded category and systemic issues including low-quality teachers and outdated teaching methods, despite the letter grading system being designed to enhance education standards.\nNepal's government recalled ambassadors ahead of PM Dahal's India visit; highlights recent diplomatic developments, including the progress in implementing agreements with China and the BRI projects.\nThe National ID Card has become mandatory in 28 districts for accessing government and public institution services, with critics arguing against its enforcement before widespread distribution, despite ongoing efforts to replace multiple cards and enhance security.\nDespite being adopted eight years ago, Nepal's federal system faces challenges due to centralized decision-making, lack of provincial autonomy, and political interference, leading to criticism and demands for amendments or overhauling.\nHeavy to very heavy rainfall is expected in Koshi, Madhesh, Bagmai, Gandaki and Lumbini provinces, with light to moderate rain and thunderstorms nationwide.\nHeavy rainfall with thunder and lightning is expected across multiple provinces in Nepal, with the possibility of very heavy rainfall in some areas, accompanied by generally cloudy conditions and a temperature range of 16.0-36.4 degrees Celsius.\nWednesday's forecast: partly to cloudy with light to moderate rain, thunder, and lightning in Koshi, Madhesh, Gandaki, Lumbini, and Bagmati provinces; heavy rainfall in parts of Koshi, Madhesh, and Gandaki; Thursday's forecast: generally cloudy with light to moderate rainfall and heavy rainfall in Koshi, Madhesh, Gandaki, and Lumbini.\nRain and thunderstorms forecast for multiple provinces in Nepal, with heavy rainfall warnings for Koshi, Madhesh, and Gandaki.\n\nBe elaborative as possible.
