Write it in the form of inspiring story not news article or event.\n    \n    Story:\nOnce upon a time, nestled between the towering peaks of the Himalayas and the lush jungles of the Terai, there was a country named Nepal. Though still a developing nation, Nepal was a land of profound beauty and deep-rooted cultural heritage. The residents of Nepal faced many challenges, but beneath these hardships lay a resilient spirit and an unyielding hope for the future.\n\nThis enchanting land, where Mount Everest reaches towards the skies and the air carries a mix of incense and cool mountain breezes, was more than a geographical marvel. It was a mosaic of cultures, languages, and traditions, a testament to human endeavor against all odds. Nepal's history, from the unification under King Prithvi Narayan Shah to its transformation into a federal democratic republic, told a story of aspiration and endurance.\n\nIn recent years, the people of Nepal, with their indomitable will, had taken strides towards rebuilding and reimagining their country. They turned their struggles into stepping stones, each challenge a chapter in their ongoing saga. The shift from a monarchy to a republic had not only changed governance but had woven a new tapestry of democratic values and collective decision-making.\n\nEconomically, while agriculture continued to sustain a large part of its population, Nepal had begun to harness the potential of its picturesque landscapes, developing sustainable tourism that promised to preserve their natural heritage while boosting local economies. Communities living in the shadows of the Himalayas had become stewards of the earth, protecting the biodiversity that made their country unique.\n\nEach day brought new stories. Whether it was a festival in Kathmandu, a technological advance in Pokhara, or a conservation effort in Chitwan, these events were threads in the vibrant quilt of Nepali life. These stories, updated daily, reflected the pulse of progress and the spirit of hope that characterized this resilient nation.\n\nAnd so, as Nepal moved forward, each moment was not just a passage of time but a promise of potential, a narrative of a nation perennially climbing towards tomorrow, guided by the legacy of its past and the dreams of its future.\n\nNews events:\nSeven years and seven months after inking the Memorandum of Understanding on the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), Nepal and China on Wednesday signed a framework for BRI cooperation during Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli’s China visit, which ends on Thursday.Acting Foreign Secretary Amrit Bahadur Rai and deputy head of China’s National Development and Reform Commission Liu Sushe signed the framework cooperation on behalf of the respective countries. The commission is the focal agency in China, tasked with the development of BRI projects.The framework will be valid for three years and will get another three-year extension unless terminated by either side.Speaking briefly from Beijing with the Post, Foreign Minister Arzu Rana Deuba said that the framework signed on Wednesday is not new. “It should be understood as a continuation of the memorandum of understanding signed in 2017,” she added.A joint task force of the Nepali Congress and the CPN-UML, the two largest parties and ruling partners, in Kathmandu had tweaked the original BRI implementation plan proposed by the Chinese side in 2020.Wednesday’s development formally endorses Nepal’s involvement in the BRI, a programme China proposed and Nepal initially signed in 2017. But negotiations on the projects under the BRI could still prove difficult in the future.‘Aid financing modalities’, as have been agreed under the new framework, have elements of both grant and loan, said one Nepali official who is a part of Oli’s delegation in Beijing.“Even as we signed the framework, we were clear that we cannot accept projects under the BRI with interest rates exceeding those charged by bilateral and multilateral donors,” the official said. “Our focus would be on seeking grants and concessional loans in line with the interest rates offered by the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank and other bilateral and multilateral agencies.”Wednesday’s agreement paves the way for negotiations on the ten projects that Nepal had proposed to China.“Today, we signed the Framework for Belt and Road Cooperation,” Prime Minister Oli wrote in his X account. “I am honoured to reflect on the bilateral talks with Premier Li Qiang, discussions with National People’s Congress of China Chairman Zhao Leji and the highly fruitful meeting with President Xi Jinping.”The economic cooperation between Nepal and China will further strengthen under the Belt and Road Framework Cooperation, writes Oli.Just ahead of the prime minister’s departure for Beijing on Monday, the Nepali side had sent a new version of the framework for BRI cooperation and insisted on grants as the project financing model. But the Chinese side objected to the words and replaced them with ‘assistance financing’ and sent the document back to the Nepali side for consideration.“Then we sat again, spoke with the prime minister and proposed a middle path using the phrase ‘aid financing’ as a modality,” one Nepali member of the delegation told the Post from Beijing over the phone. “The Chinese took some time to consider our proposal. Therefore, the new BRI framework is missing in the joint communiqué released late Tuesday. Eventually, both parties agreed on the term ‘aid assistance financing’ and the agreement was signed on Wednesday.” On Nepal’s side, the negotiations were led by Prime Minister Oli’s economic and development adviser Yubaraj Khatiwada, Foreign Minister Arzu Rana Deuba and Acting Foreign Secretary Rai. High-ranking foreign ministry officials represented the Chinese delegation.As Nepal and China are in different stages of development, projects will be selected on the basis of Nepal’s specific requirements and needs. During project negotiation, the final BRI framework agreement states, both sides should uphold the principle of technical, financial, commercial and economic viability and value for money. Likewise, both sides will work to create a conducive business environment.The ‘Objective’ of the BRI framework cooperation states that both sides should facilitate the financial and technical cooperation for each project, and they identified the areas of cooperation—economic development, financial sector cooperation, transport, connectivity and logistic cooperation, trade industrial capacity and investment cooperation, and customs clearance—according to another member of the Nepali delegation who is in Beijing.Nepal has proposed ten different projects to be executed under the BRI. They are Tokha-Chhahare tunnel road, Hilsa-Simikot road project, Kimathanka-Khandbari road and bridge, Jilong-Kerung-Kathmandu cross-border railway, Amargadhi City Hall in Dadeldhura, Jilong-Kerung-Rasuwagadhi-Chilime 220KV transmission line, Madan Bhandari University, Kathmandu Scientific Centre and Science Museum, China-Nepal friendship industrial park in Damak and Jhapa sports and athletic complex.Nepal will set priorities and prepare the implementation plan for each of these projects. The Nepali side, in the negotiation phase, had changed several proposals.The Nepali side significantly shortened the list of priority areas originally proposed by the Chinese side in early 2020 which included construction of the Trans-Himalayan Multi Dimensional Connectivity Network, including ports, roads, bridges, tunnels, highways, railways, aviation infrastructure, telecom projects, electricity transmission line, carrying out the China-Nepal cross-border railway project.Similarly, the two sides will develop implementation plans for energy related projects, cooperation in the field of e-commerce and trade and industrial capacity enhancement, building trade infrastructures, adopting trade and investment liberalisation, and expanding bilateral economic relationship.The BRI framework provides significant impetus for a stronger economic and project development partnership between the two countries, said Semanta Dahal, who was part of the task force that revised the BRI framework on behalf of the ruling coalition in a capacity of legal adviser. He added that it addresses ambiguities surrounding the infrastructure projects to be implemented under the BRI in Nepal and establishes clear negotiation principles, including the use of aid financing.“This will facilitate negotiations on a project-by-project basis and ensure that infrastructure and connectivity projects offer value for money,” he said. \nAmid a delay in publishing a shortlist of office-bearer candidates for the two transitional justice commissions, a section of the human rights activists has expressed concern over suspected attempts to pick candidates on partisan basis.In a statement on Wednesday, they claimed that conspiracies are being hatched against the selection of office bearers through a competitive process.“Such unwarranted political interference in the selection process will once again put the transitional justice process at risk and undermine the national goal of completing the remaining tasks of the peace process,” reads the statement.They are concerned as the committee formed to recommend the chairpersons and members of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission and the Commission of Investigation on Enforced Disappeared Persons struggles to publish a shortlist more than two weeks after the extended application deadline ended.Against the claim that it would shortlist the candidates latest by November end, the Om Prakash Mishra-led committee hasn’t been able to do so. Those aware of the developments say the selection committee is waiting for the consent of the top leadership of three major parties. In particular, it awaits the return of Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli, who also is CPN-UML chairperson, from China before publishing the shortlist. Though the committee has already met the top leaders individually, it wants Oli, Nepali Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba and CPN (Maoist Centre) chairperson Pushpa Kamal Dahal to get their approvals on the names.The committee had received 156 applications from retired judges, government officials, legal experts, rights defenders, and the victims of the decade-long Maoist insurgency. However, it considered only 128 names, claiming that the remaining 28 individuals were recommended by different organisations without their personal consent. The Mishra-led panel wants to include some of the 28 names after getting their consent. Yet, these personnel being considered apparently won’t give their consent unless their appointments are assured. In addition, the selection committee is under pressure to recommend Sudip Pathak, a former member of the National Human Rights Commission, to chair a commission. However, the victims and human rights defenders are against his nomination. This puts the committee in a fix.Without naming Pathak, the rights defenders’ statement stresses that individuals with questionable integrity, those who courted controversies in their past constitutional responsibilities and the ones who have failed to gain legitimacy from the victims’ communities and civil society should not be recommended for transitional justice commissions. It would be unacceptable for such persons to be included in the selection process, as it would make the entire process contentious, reads the statement.“Pathak has a controversial image as a member of the human rights commission. The statement is targeted at him,” one of the signatories to the statement told the Post. A group of victims and human rights defenders on Wednesday met Deuba to draw his attention against Pathak’s nomination. In response, Deuba said he has already given his word to Pathak but was still ready to reconsider if there are better alternatives, according to a member of the group who spoke to the Congress leader.On Tuesday, victims’ representatives, along with some human rights activists, met United Nations Resident Coordinator Hanaa Singer-Hamdy to discuss the UN’s role in the overall transitional justice process. “We also discussed the impartiality in the selection of the office bearers,” Gopal Shah, chairperson of the Conflict Victims National Network, told the Post.The statement undersigned by Sushil Pyakurel, Subodh Pyakurel, Kanak Mani Dixit, Kundan Aryal, Charan Prasai, Mandira Sharma, Rajan Kuikel, Raju Prasad Chapagain and Suman Adhikari says the credibility and success of the entire transitional justice process depends on the selection of officials who have the capacity to fulfill the huge responsibility of transitional justice. “We, therefore, strongly urge the recommendation committee to carry out the selection process independently, impartially, and transparently without any compromise,” reads the statement. “We want to warn the recommendation committee that failure to carry out their duties properly would be a betrayal to the nation.”The selection committee, however, says it wants to recommend the best candidates for the 10 positions—five members each, including the chair, in the two commissions—and it was taking time. “Checking the backgrounds, qualifications and expertise of so many candidates takes time. We plan to publish a shortlist by the end of this week,” Khamma Khati, spokesperson for the committee, told the Post. “We will recommend the best persons to lead the commissions through a fair and impartial process.” \nDuring COVID-19, Nepal faced a fertilizer shortage; in response, a couple in Rupandehi established Grow More Fertiliser and Chemical, producing the first granulated organic fertilizer in Nepal, with plans to supply it to farmers' doorsteps and replace chemical fertilizers.\nKathmandu Gurkhas and Biratnagar Kings notched their first wins in the Nepal Premier League T20 tournament, with Karan KC and Lokesh Bam starring in their respective victories over Karnali Yaks and Lumbini Lions.\nPresident Paudel underwent prostate surgery successfully at TUTH, after struggling with prostate problems for years.\nJanakpur Bolts remained undefeated in the NPL, registering a third consecutive win with a seven-wicket triumph over Pokhara Avengers despite Pokhara's Matthew Cross top-scoring with 35 runs.\nResults of the Nepalese by-elections reveal a shift in voters' preferences away from new political forces and towards traditional parties, with the CPN (Maoist Centre) gaining seats while the Nepali Congress and CPN-UML lost some.\nHindu monk's arrest ignites tensions between India and Bangladesh, leading to protests, clashes, and diplomatic fallout, straining bilateral relations and raising concerns over minority safety.\nIn under four months, tenth graders all over Nepal will appear in the School Education Examination (SEE). This is a time for students to focus on final preparations. Sadly, hard work alone won’t yield better results when the schools and curriculum fail to cater to their needs. Every year, when the results are out, many students have to endure crushing failure. However, as in previous years, the authorities have failed to learn from their mistakes. Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli is making baseless predictions of a 70 percent pass rate in the upcoming SEE. How will this be achieved in a country where pass rates have for years hovered below 50 percent?Among 464,785 students who appeared in the last SEE, only 222,472—47.87 percent—secured a Grade Point Average (GPA) above 1.60, which is necessary to study at a higher level. However, 242,313 students—52.13 percent—were categorised as non-graded. After the supplementary exams, over a third of them were graded, qualifying them to study in grade 11. Oli’s forecast is only plausible if the results improve by around 50 percent, which is unlikely. The grading system was introduced in 2016 to reform the examination system, focusing less on marks and more on interactive learning. But the hangover of the old School Leaving Certificate (SLC) exams persists. While the system has been upgraded, the teaching and learning are still the same. Schools are grappling with a shortage of teachers for major subjects like Science, Mathematics and English. Rural provinces like Karnali have suffered the most and some schools are hiring under-qualified teachers to fill the gaps. With teachers unable to address their problems, students have no choice but to rely on rote learning. To cope, the government is focusing on extra online classes. But such online classes for school students hold only symbolic value. In Nepal, fear has always been a tool for teaching and learning. Most schools do not foster an environment where students enjoy learning. This mentality also applies to how the education system views examinations like SEE. Students are put under pressure to perform well, as if it were a “do or die” situation. The shame of failure scars students for life. Some private schools take advantage of this fragile emotional state of students by enforcing mandatory tuition classes. Further, as schools in rural areas can’t complete the syllabus on time, it creates an opportunity for private tuition centres to generate profit as students migrate a few months before SEE to study in such centres. During this year’s SEE, over 500 grade 10 students across Bajhang were studying in tuition centres.Schedule 8 of the constitution gives local units the authority to manage school education. But the lack of a Federal Education Act, a must to implement constitutional provisions, is a big hurdle towards this laudable goal. Among its various flaws, the controversial Education Bill, registered in Parliament last year, fails to establish minimum criteria for establishing schools. The government must realise that the basics must be fulfilled before setting lofty goals. There must be mechanisms to recruit qualified teachers and retain them. It is also imperative to update the pedagogy for courses such as BEd and MEd to produce quality teachers. The SEE marks the culmination of over a decade of schooling. Therefore, it is unfair to blame the students who have trusted the system for long. The poor SEE results are a direct reflection of the system’s failure. Whether we have the SEE or the SLC, the flawed education system will continue to jeopardise the future of hundreds of thousands of young students.  \nPrime Minister Khadga Prasad Sharma Oli chose New York as his first visit abroad to attend the 79th United Nations General Assembly. He held a 45-minute-long meeting on the sidelines with his Indian counterpart, Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Sharma Oli described the talk as ‘positive’. Modi termed it ‘very good’. Shorn of diplomatese, both statements implied that the meeting had failed to restore mutual trust between them.It took Premier Sharma Oli a while to get an invitation from his Chinese counterpart. The agenda of the visit had to be negotiated with the Nepali Congress, the largest party in the Pratinidhi Sabha that is keeping the government afloat. The chattering classes of Kathmandu were excited that Sharma Oli had chosen Beijing over New Delhi as his first official visit. The misplaced enthusiasm is meaningless: Beijing is politically hallowed for communists of all shades just as Banares is sacred for every pious Hindu.In any case, Nepal must be the only country where China and India are considered competitors. The Chinese economy is nearly five times bigger than India’s GDP. The military spending of Beijing is at least three times that of India. Ranked at 75, China is grouped high on the global Human Development Index (HDI) while India with its 134 score falls well below Bhutan and Bangladesh. Beijing and New Delhi aren’t in the same league.Geopolitical strategists in the capital cities of Nepal’s neighbouring countries are more fearful of Washington's intentions than those of each other. For a brief while in the 1950s, the United States worked with Indians to contain China and stop Beijing from spreading its wings in South Asia. Officially, the Ping-Pong diplomacy began in 1971, but a lot of hush-hush preparations must have been done earlier for the sudden thaw in the frozen relations.Once Chairman Mao Zedong shook the hand of President Richard Nixon on February 21, 1972, the balance of power in the world began to change irreversibly. Chairman Mao had found a stepping stone to emerge out of the well of seclusion that he had dug for the Chinese with his disastrous campaigns of the Great Leap Forward and the Cultural Revolution.Awakened dragonUnable to withstand the pressure of perestroika (restructuring) and glasnost (openness), the USSR’s downfall began with the fall of the Berlin Wall and gained momentum with the collapse of satellite regimes in East Europe. The greatest political experiment of what historian Eric Hobsbawm has called “the short twentieth century 1914-1991” completely disintegrated with the humiliating ouster of Mikhail Gorbachev. The contested concept of unipolarity did have its brief moment in the sun, but it soon dissolved when Francis Fukuyama’s The End of History? hypothesis was countered by his guru Samuel Huntington’s The Clash of Civilizations? formulation heralding the beginning of a multipolar world of contesting civilisations. Meanwhile, the Paramount Leader of China Deng Xiaoping had already started a modernisation drive in the 1980s with his oft-quoted command: “observe calmly, secure our position, cope with affairs calmly, hide our capacities and bide our time, be good at maintaining a low profile, and never claim leadership.” Exalted with the title of “core leader”, President Xi Jinping has built the structure of global ascendency on the ground that Mao broke with the help of President Nixon in the 1970s. President Deng laid the foundation with the cooperation of President Ronald Reagan in the 1980s, and President Jiang Zemin erected a scaffold of export-led growth with the collaboration of President Bill Clinton in the 1990s, which culminated in China being admitted into the World Trade Organisation.Despite its status of being the technological giant and a military superpower throughout the Cold War, Moscow lacked the economic muscle to challenge the hegemony of Washington that had been institutionalised through the Bretten Wood Sisters—the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank Group—that undergirded the global trade and industry. The legacy of the British Empire had left English as the lingua franca of a large part of the world. It helped establish Hollywood films, British publications and New York fashion as the desirable elements of the upwardly mobile lifestyle of the growing middleclass in the Third World countries. The financial hub had shifted from London to New York. The Silicon Valley in California had emerged as the nucleus of cutting-edge technology. Backed by enormous endowments, the Ivy League institutions were attracting the best and brightest of the world. All that the USSR had to offer in comparison was the theory of the inevitable collapse of capitalism. The Chinese began to grow out of all such illusions in the 1970s and have gone about building an alternative to the plutocratic capitalism of the Washington Consensus with their model of authoritarian capitalism based on the Beijing Consensus.Wounded eaglePresident Xi Jinping’s concept of “building a community with a shared future for mankind” is an outline of an alternative world order. The Chinese designs of the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO), the BRICS grouping that has more members than the acronym can accommodate, the Global Development Initiative (GDI), the Global Security Initiative (GSI), the Global Civilisation Initiative (GCI) and the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) are aimed at what has been termed as “Making China Great Again”.Just as unipolarity is an oxymoron, multipolarity is merely a desire of emerging nations for a seat at the high table. Ultimately, they must coalesce around a country with the determination and wherewithal to offer an alternative to the existing world order. Even though the Russians hosted the 16th annual BRICS summit at Kazan, China was the power behind the throne of President Vladimir Putin. President Xi Jinping agreed “in principle to the suggestions made by Prime Minister Narendra Modi” at the summit, which is a signal to the world that India will be careful in future about encircling China on behalf of the US. The collective anxiety of the geopolitical and geoeconomic establishment in the US about the future of their unchallenged dominance for almost a century is understandable. The incoherence in the statements of President Donald Trump probably comes from the confusion of the Make America Great Again (MAGA) team that has little idea about the frustrations of many countries with American hegemony.President Trump was unintelligibly provocative—meaningless covfefe is but one example—in his first term. It seems his second stint is going to be stormier. He is promising punitive tariff hikes. That will hasten the triumph of China-centric and China-inspired Pax Autocratica over Pax Democratica. President Trump appears to be determined to complete the task begun by President Nixon in the 1970s.Premier Sharma Oli’s pilgrimage to Beijing is a sideshow. Chieftains from tributary states are often rewarded for their fidelity, and Sharma Oli is likely to comeback with enough lollipops to silence his critics at home. But Beijing will perhaps be more interested in asking that Kathmandu shift its primary loyalty from Washington to Beijing. Nepal’s diplomatic dilemma will be much more perplexing than occasionally flashing the China card at New Delhi to assert its sovereignty.  \nSouth Korean opposition lawmakers said on Thursday they would vote this weekend to impeach President Yoon Suk Yeol over his botched attempt to impose martial law, while the defence minister blamed for recommending the move resigned.Yoon’s declaration of martial law late on Tuesday sought to consolidate power, ban political activity and censor the media in Asia’s fourth-largest economy and a key US ally.It sparked outrage in the streets and concern among South Korea’s international allies.Lawmakers of the opposition Democratic Party planned to seek a vote in parliament to impeach Yoon at about 7 p.m. (1000 GMT) on Saturday, a party spokesperson told reporters.“The Yoon Suk Yeol regime’s declaration of emergency martial law caused great confusion and fear among our people,” Democratic Party lawmaker Kim Seung-won told the National Assembly earlier.Yoon’s ruling People Power Party is divided over the crisis but said it would oppose impeachment with the party in turmoil and two years left in Yoon's five-year term.The Democratic Party needs at least eight of the 108 ruling-party lawmakers to back the bill for it to pass with a two-thirds majority in the 300-seat parliament.Fighting for his political future, Yoon accepted the resignation of Defence Minister Kim Yong-hyun on Thursday and nominated his ambassador to Saudi Arabia, Choi Byung-hyuk, as a replacement, Yoon’s office said.Kim had recommended Yoon declare martial law on Tuesday, according to the interior minister, a senior military official and the opposition’s filing to impeach Yoon.Kim also ordered the deployment of troops to the parliament, Vice-Defence Minister Kim Seon-ho said, adding that he was unaware of the martial law order until Yoon declared it.“I have fundamentally opposed the mobilisation of military forces under martial law and have expressed negative opinions about it,” Kim Seon-ho told a parliament hearing on Thursday, apologising and taking responsibility for failing to prevent it.South Korea’s army chief has also offered to resign, the Yonhap news agency said.The former defence minister now faces a travel ban as prosecutors investigate the attempt to impose martial law, broadcaster YTN said. Yoon and the interior minister were also being investigated, Yonhap said.INSTABILITY ALARMSJapanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba said Japan’s “security situation may be fundamentally changed” in light of the instability in Seoul and North Korea’s rising military assertiveness.“What will happen to South Korea? There appears to be a great deal of domestic criticism and opposition,” he told parliament, adding that Yoon’s efforts to improve relations with Tokyo “must never be undermined”.There has been no reaction yet from North Korea to the drama in the South.On Wednesday, Secretary of State Antony Blinken told Reuters the United States had not been made aware in advance of Yoon’s declaration, while his deputy, Kurt Campbell, said Yoon had badly misjudged it.The United States has 28,500 troops stationed in South Korea as a legacy of the 1950-1953 Korean War.The commander of US Forces-Korea, General Paul LaCamera, warned American troops to stay vigilant, avoid areas with protests, and tell superiors of travel plans in case “something unexpected” happens.Yoon had been embraced by leaders in the West as a partner in the US-led effort to unify democracies against growing authoritarianism in China, Russia and elsewhere.But he caused unease among South Koreans by branding his critics “communist totalitarian and anti-state forces”. In November, he denied wrongdoing in response to accusations of influence-peddling against him and his wife and he has taken a hard line against labour unions. \nThe owner of a food stall in Vũng Tàu City in southern Việt Nam has been fined VNĐ125 million (US$4,900) and will have to suspend their operations for five months, in the wake of a massive food poisoning incident linked to the stall that affected over 340 individuals were affected by food poisoning, including one death.According to Bà Rịa-Vũng Tàu Province’s authorities, the owner of bánh mì shop Cô Ba on Nguyễn An Ninh Street in Ward 7 was found guilty of several violations, including selling contaminated food and failing to meet food safety standards.On November 26, multiple customers who purchased bread from the bakery reported symptoms such as stomach pain, dizziness, nausea, and diarrhoea, including a 71-year-old man who tragically succumbed after consuming the food.The affected patrons were treated at local hospitals, and all have since stabilised and been discharged, according to local authorities.According to investigations, the food poisoning was caused by contaminated pork products and raw vegetables infected with Salmonella and E. coli bacteria.Food safety remains a pressing concern in Việt Nam, particularly among street food vendors who frequently flout hygiene regulations.In a similar incident last year, a popular bánh mì shop in Hội An town in the central province of Quảng Nam was heavily fined and suspended after over 300 individuals fell ill from consuming its bread, though no fatalities were reported.-In Association with ANN \nBitcoin catapulted above $100,000 for the first time on Thursday, a milestone hailed even by sceptics as a coming-of-age for cryptocurrencies as investors bet on a friendly US administration to cement cryptos' place in financial markets.The total value of the cryptocurrency market has almost doubled over the year so far to hit a record just shy of $3.8 trillion, according to data provider CoinGecko. By comparison, Apple alone is worth about $3.7 trillion.Bitcoin’s march from the libertarian fringe to Wall Street has minted millionaires, a new asset class and popularised the concept of “decentralised finance” in a volatile and often controversial period since its creation 16 years ago.Bitcoin has more than doubled in value this year and is up more than 50% in the four weeks since Donald Trump’s sweeping election victory, which also saw a slew of pro-crypto lawmakers being elected to Congress.Once it broke $100,000 in Thursday’s Asian morning, it was soon above $103,000 and was last fetching $103,335 .“We’re witnessing a paradigm shift,” said Mike Novogratz, founder and CEO of US crypto firm Galaxy Digital.“Bitcoin and the entire digital asset ecosystem are on the brink of entering the financial mainstream - this momentum is fuelled by institutional adoption, advancements in tokenisation and payments, and a clearer regulatory path.”Trump embraced digital assets during his campaign, promising to make the United States the “crypto capital of the planet” and to accumulate a national stockpile of bitcoin.“We were trading basically sideways for about seven months, then immediately after Nov. 5, US investors resumed buying hand-over-fist,” said Joe McCann, CEO and founder of Asymmetric, a Miami digital assets hedge fund.On Wednesday, Trump said he would nominate Paul Atkins to run the Securities and Exchange Commission.Atkins, a former SEC commissioner, has been involved in crypto policy as co-chair of the Token Alliance, which works to \"develop best practices for digital asset issuances and trading platforms,\" and the Chamber of Digital Commerce.“Atkins will offer a new perspective, anchored by a deep understanding of the digital asset ecosystem,” said Blockchain Association CEO Kristin Smith.“We look forward to working with him ... and ushering in – together – a new wave of American crypto innovation.”A slew of crypto companies including Ripple, Kraken and Circle are also jostling for a seat on Trump's promised crypto advisory council.PART OF THE LANDSCAPEBitcoin has proven a survivor through precipitous downturns.Its move into six-figure territory is a remarkable comeback from a dip below $16,000 in 2022 when the industry was reeling from the collapse of the FTX exchange. Founder Sam Bankman-Fried was subsequently jailed.Analysts say the growing embrace of bitcoin by big investors this year has been a driving force behind the record-breaking rally.US-listed bitcoin exchange-traded funds were approved in January and have been a conduit for large-scale buying, with more than $4 billion streaming into these funds since the election.“Roughly 3% of the total supply of bitcoins that will ever exist have been purchased in 2024 by institutional money,” said Geoff Kendrick, global head of digital assets research at Standard Chartered.“Digital assets, as an asset class, is becoming normalised,” he said. “If you fast forward a number of years on trading floors you'll have a sales and trading desk...which will sit alongside FX and rates and commodities.”It is already becoming increasingly financialised, with the launch of bitcoin futures in 2017 and a strong debut for options on BlackRock’s ETF in November.Crypto-related stocks have soared along with the bitcoin price, with shares in bitcoin miner MARA Holdings and exchange operator Coinbase each up around 65% in November.Trump himself unveiled a new crypto business, World Liberty Financial, in September, although details have been scarce and billionaire Elon Musk, a major Trump ally, is also a proponent of cryptocurrencies.‘WHO CAN PROHIBIT IT’The cryptocurrency industry has been criticised for its massive energy usage, while crypto crime remains a concern, and the underlying technology is yet to deliver a major revolution in the way money moves around the globe.Still, as Russian President Vladimir Putin pointed out at an investment conference on Wednesday: “Who can prohibit it? No one.” And its longevity is perhaps testament to a degree of resilience.“As time goes by it's proving itself as part of the financial landscape,” said Shane Oliver, chief economist and head of investment strategy at AMP in Sydney.“I find it very hard to value it ... it’s anyone’s guess. But it does have a momentum aspect to it and at the moment the momentum is up.” \nPokhara Avengers in their second match set a target of 139 runs against Janakpur Bolts in the ongoing Nepal Premier League (NPL) at the Tribhuvan University Cricket Ground, Kirtipur on Thursday.Pokhara set the target of 139 runs at the loss of 7 wickets in 20 overs. Pokhara improved their batting compared to their first game where they could score only 74 runs against Chitwan Rhinos and lost the game by 87 runs. Openers Dinesh Kharel and Andries Gous made a partnership of 32 runs before losing their first wicket. Andries Gous 20 [off 16 balls] was bowled out by Lalit Rajbanshi while Kharel was bowled out by James Neesham. Avengers Captain Kushal Bhurtel continued his bad batting being run out at 6 [off 6 balls]. Pokhara lost their 4th wicket in 70 runs with Dilip Nath 11 [off 14 balls]. With wickets being taken down quickly by Bolt’s bowlers, Pokhara’s batting was handled by Mathew Critchley who scored 35 [off 30 balls], Raymon Reifer [17 off 20 balls] and Michael Leask, who scored 25 off 13 balls in the last over. For Janakpur Bolts Lalit Rajbanshi took 3 wickets, James Neesham took two, while Muhammad Mohsin and Kishore Mahato took a wicket each.In the second match today, Kathmandu Gurkhas are locking horns with Sudurpaschim Royals at 1:15 pm. \nFrench lawmakers passed a no-confidence vote against the government on Wednesday, throwing the European Union’s second-biggest economic power deeper into a crisis that threatens its capacity to legislate and tame a massive budget deficit.Far-right and left-wing lawmakers joined forces to back a no-confidence motion against Prime Minister Michel Barnier, with a majority of 331 votes in support of the motion.Barnier now has to tender his resignation and that of his government to President Emmanuel Macron, making his minority government’s three-month tenure the shortest lived in France’s Fifth Republic beginning in 1958. He is expected to do so on Thursday morning, French media reported.The hard left and far right punished Barnier for using special constitutional powers to adopt part of an unpopular budget without a final vote in parliament, where it lacked majority support. The draft budget had sought 60 billion euros ($63.07 billion) in savings in a drive to shrink a gaping deficit.“This (deficit) reality will not disappear by the magic of a motion of censure,” Barnier told lawmakers ahead of the vote, adding the budget deficit would come back to haunt whichever government comes next.No French government had lost a confidence vote since Georges Pompidou’s in 1962. Macron ushered in the crisis by calling a snap election in June that delivered a polarised parliament.With its president diminished, France now risks ending the year without a stable government or a 2025 budget, although the constitution allows special measures that would avert a US-style government shutdown.France’s political turmoil will further weaken a European Union already reeling from the implosion of Germany’s coalition government, and weeks before US President-elect Donald Trump returns to the White House.The country's outgoing defence minister Sebastien Lecornu warned the turmoil could impact French support for Ukraine.The hard left France Unbowed (LFI) party demanded Macron’s resignation.Barnier’s demise was cheered by far-right chief Marine Le Pen, who has sought for years to portray her National Rally party as a government in waiting.“I’m not pushing for Macron’s resignation,” she said. “The pressure on the president will get greater and greater. Only he will make that decision.”NO EASY EXIT FROM FRENCH POLITICAL CRISISFrance now faces a period of deep political uncertainty that is already unnerving investors in French sovereign bonds and stocks. Earlier this week, France's borrowing costs briefly exceeded those of Greece, generally considered far more risky.Macron must now make a choice. The Elysee Palace said the president would address the nation on Thursday evening.Three sources told Reuters that Macron aimed to install a new prime minister swiftly, with one saying he wanted to name a premier before a ceremony to reopen the Notre-Dame Cathedral on Saturday, which Trump is due to attend.Any new prime minister would face the same challenges as Barnier in getting bills, including the 2025 budget, adopted by a divided parliament. There can be no new parliamentary election before July.Macron could alternatively ask Barnier and his ministers to stay on in a caretaker capacity while he takes time to identify a prime minister able to attract sufficient cross-party support to pass legislation.A caretaker government could either propose emergency legislation to roll the tax-and-spend provisions in the 2024 budget into next year, or invoke special powers to pass the draft 2025 budget by decree - though jurists say this is a legal grey area and the political cost would be huge.Macron’s opponents also could vote down one prime minister after the next.ECONOMIC PAINThe upheaval is not without risk for Le Pen.Macron allies sought to present her as an agent of chaos after her party joined forces with the left to down Barnier.“The French will harshly judge the choice you are going to make,” Laurent Wauquiez, a lawmaker from the conservative Les Republicains party who backs Macron, told Le Pen in parliament.Since Macron called the summer snap election, France’s CAC 40 benchmark stock market index has dropped nearly 10% and is the heaviest loser among top EU economies.The euro EUR=EBS showed little immediate reaction versus the dollar, trading for around $1.05 per euro, but dipping against other European currencies, such as the Swiss franc and the pound.“I’m amazed the euro hasn’t moved much,” said Nick Rees, senior foreign exchange market analyst at Monex Europe. “There are two major powers in Europe, France and Germany, both of which right now are emasculated.”Barnier’s draft budget had sought to cut the fiscal deficit from a projected 6% of national output this year to 5% in 2025. Voting down his government would be catastrophic for state finances, he had said.Le Pen shrugged off the warning. She said her party would support any eventual emergency law that rolls over the 2024 budget’s tax-and-spend provisions into next year to ensure there is stopgap financing. \nOn Thursday the weather is forecast to be partly cloudy in the hilly areas of Koshi and Gandaki Province. The rest of the country is to remain mainly fair.Tonight the hilly areas of the Koshi and Gandaki Province is forecast to be partly cloudy and mainly fair in the rest of the country.According to the Meteorological analysis, the country is not influenced by any weather pattern.

The first encounter at 9:15 am sees the Pokhara Avengers battling the Janakpur Bolts, followed by an exciting clash between Kathmandu Gurkhas and Sudurpaschim Royals at 1:15 pm.The Pokhara Avengers, led by marquee player Kushal Bhurtel, are yet to secure a win, having lost their only match so far. With a squad featuring talents like Sagar Dhakal and foreign stars such as Bas de Leede and Raymon Reifer, the team will be eager to turn their fortunes around under the guidance of coach Rajeev Kumar.The Janakpur Bolts, conversely, are on a roll, winning both their matches to sit comfortably with 4 points. Led by captain Anil Sah, with marquee player Aasif Sheikh and international stars like James Neesham and Ben Mike, the Bolts, coached by Pubudu Dassanayake, look formidable contenders. In the second match, the Kathmandu Gurkhas, captained by marquee player Karan KC, face the Sudurpaschim Royals, led by Dipendra Singh Airee. Both teams have 2 points from two matches with one win and one loss each when.The Gurkhas have key players such as Bhim Sharki and international talents like Stevie Eskinazi and Gerhard Erasmus to make an impact. On the other hand, the Royals, featuring players like Abinash Bohara and Rohan Mustafa, aim to establish dominance with strategic gameplay under coach Jagat Tamata.Thursday’s matches are expected to play a crucial role in shaping the league standings as teams fight for a spot in the playoffs. \nNepal and China have officially signed the BRI Cooperation Framework during Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli’s visit to China. This development formally further advances Nepal’s involvement in the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), a programme China proposed and Nepal initially signed in 2017.The signing was delayed on Tuesday due to disagreements over terminology to be used in the draft. The debate centred on whether to include the term “grant” in the financial cooperation modality. Following further discussions, a consensus was reached on Wednesday, with both sides agreeing to use the term “aid assistance financing.”A senior Nepali official involved in the talks said that discussions have finally concluded leading to an agreement on the framework. Initially, the Nepali side proposed ‘grant financing cooperation modality,’ which was amended by the Chinese to ‘assistant financing modality.’ Eventually, the term ‘aid assistance financing’ was agreed upon by both parties.”On Nepal’s side, the negotiations were led by Prime Minister Oli’s economic and development advisor Yubaraj Khatiwada and Foreign Minister Arzu Rana Deuba. High-ranking officials from China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs represented the Chinese delegation.This agreement marks a significant step in Nepal-China relations, paving the way for enhanced economic cooperation under the framework of the BRI, a major programme introduced by Chinese President Xi Jinping. \nLumbini Lions posted a formidable target of 192 runs for Biratnagar Kings in their first match of the Nepal Premier League (NPL) on Wednesday at the Tribhuvan University Cricket Ground, Kirtipur.Batting first after losing the toss, Lumbini scored 191 runs for the loss of seven wickets in the allotted 20 overs. This is the highest team total in the tournament so far, surpassing Sudurpaschim’s 182 runs against Biratnagar on Tuesday.Captain Rohit Paudel led the charge with 46 runs off 29 balls, hitting four boundaries and two sixes. Openers Ashutosh Ghirohiya and Arjun Saud contributed 15 and 17 runs, respectively. Tom Moores, who struck three consecutive sixes off Anil Kharel, scored 30 runs off 17 balls before being run out.Four of Lumbini’s batsmen were run out, including Sundeep Jora (12) and Ben Cutting (6). Vivek Yadav provided fireworks in the final over, smashing two sixes off the first two balls bowled by Basir Ahmed, ending with an unbeaten 19 runs off seven balls.For Biratnagar, Ismatullah Alam, Rajesh Pulami, and Sandeep Lamichhane each claimed a wicket.The match puts Biratnagar Kings under pressure as they have already lost their first two games. \nDuring monsoon last year, the Chandannath Municipality of Jumla district reported several cases of dengue. The local unit has reported cases of infection from the deadly virus this year too.Although most cases were locally transmitted, health workers in the district don’t consider the virus spread a serious public health problem. This is because Jumla is among the coldest places in the country, with temperatures dipping to subzero levels in the winter.Studies, however, show a disturbing development.“My study shows the presence of Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes and their larvae in Chandannath Municipality,” said Buddhi Ram Oli, a PhD scholar at the Central Department of Zoology of the Tribhuvan University. “Chandannath Municipality is located at an elevation of 2,438 metres, and this is the first time that dengue virus-spreading mosquitoes and their larvae have been found at such a high altitude.”Earlier, vectors spreading the deadly disease were recorded only up to 2,100 metres.Local residents and health officials serving in Jumla are aware of the presence of vectors spreading deadly diseases and growing number of infections. But they don’t take the issue seriously, thinking that the vectors cannot survive long due to the climatic conditions of the region.“We once met officials at District Health Office Jumla and discussed launching an awareness drive and destroying breeding sites of mosquitoes,” said Chhatra Bahadur Mahat, health coordinator at the Chandannath Municipality. “But neither does the health office provide a budget for such programmes nor does the local unit allocate any funds. So we couldn’t do anything.”Along with Jumla, all districts across the country have recorded dengue infections this year.Oli, who carried out vector surveillance, said that, as in Chandannath Municipality, health workers at other local units too have not taken the risk of the virus-spread seriously.Experts say the country’s health workers and health facilities are ill prepared to cope with the emerging public health challenges brought about by climate change. Several health facilities were overwhelmed with dengue patients this year, too. Due to a lack of beds, patients were forced to sleep in corridors, on the floor, on chairs, in storerooms, and out in the hospital compound. Hospitals even lacked basic supplies like IV stands, and patients’ visitors had to hold the IV bags or health workers had to improvise by tying them to windows.Experts say the deadly virus outbreak in most mountain districts and all hill districts shows the impact of climate change on Nepal’s healthcare system. Despite these challenges, no effective mitigation measures have been adopted.Many hospitals are overwhelmed with an influx of patients, and health workers are forced to place seriously ill patients in corridors and other makeshift spaces, compromising patient safety.“Our health facilities are not equipped to endure the climate crisis,” said Dr Meghnath Dhimal, chief researcher at the Nepal Health Research Council. “Many are built on hilltops or riverbanks and are vulnerable to climate impacts. These health facilities are also unprepared for emerging problems and surges in patient flow.”Experts say climate change, along with some other factors, such as increased mobility and improved transportation, has been contributing to the spread of deadly diseases in places considered no-risk zones in the past.“The rise in the temperature caused by climate change provides a conducive environment for dengue vectors to thrive and spread in the mountainous areas,” said Dhimal. “Risks posed by climatic factors cannot be ignored or underestimated.”A report by the United Nations titled ‘Climate Change 2022: Impacts, Adaptation and Vulnerability’ states that at least six major vector-borne diseases have recently emerged in Nepal and are now considered endemic, with climate change implicated as the primary driver.The report also showed increasing evidence that climate change has extended the elevational distribution of Anopheles, Culex and Aedes mosquitoes, which carry viruses to above 2,000 metres in Nepal.Dengue is a viral disease transmitted by female Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes. According to the World Health Organisation, the same vector also transmits chikungunya, yellow fever, and the Zika virus.So far, 12 people have died due to dengue and over 29,000 have been infected since the start of 2024 if the government data is to be believed. Experts say reported dengue cases may only represent a small fraction of the true scale of the outbreak, as around 90 percent of the infected people do not show any symptoms and health authorities often conceal the actual number of deaths and infections.This year, districts in Tarai region reported fewer cases of dengue infection than districts in the hills and mountains. Experts attribute this to the residents of Tarai’s becoming more aware of the deadly virus and taking preventive measures. High temperatures (above 35 degrees Celsius) could also have contributed to less infection, as mosquito vectors do not survive above 35 degrees Celsius.Over the past few years, dengue has become a year-round threat in Nepal, with cases consistently on the rise. \nManufacturers and exporters say they are in a dilemma over trade with India following the restrictive measures imposed by New Delhi on Nepali goods. Making matters worse is the Nepali government’s silence even though the goods have not been sold to India for months.Dol Raj Adhikari, president of the Nepal Sanitary and Diaper Association, said sanitary pads and diapers worth of Rs250 million had been stranded in the warehouses for the past three months.“We completed all the processes to acquire the Bureau of Indian Standards [BIS] certificate to export our products, but no team from India is coming to inspect the factory. We even wrote to the Indian authority multiple times but our requests have fallen on deaf ears.”As per the provision, once the Indian inspection team gives a green signal after factory inspection, goods can be exported to India.In 2020, the Indian government asked the BIS to prescribe mandatory standards for imported goods in line with international quality norms. The move aimed to prevent Chinese goods from entering India from any of its neighbours.After the suppression of Chinese apps, the Indian government imposed import restrictions on more than 370 Chinese products. Insiders say India does not want any products from Nepal that have Chinese components, including Nepal’s hydroelectricity, greatly worrying Nepal’s top exporters.The BIS deals with the marking and certifying of goods, incorporating quality standards and information on international norms to be followed while importing.The rules worry Adhikari, who owns the AG Health Industries Private Limited that produces sanitary pads and diapers in Bhairahawa. “India seems intent to halt imports from Nepal,” said Adhikari. According to the association, Nepal used to export three truckloads of sanitary pads and diapers daily. There are 29 sanitary pads and diaper factories in Nepal, both large and small, employing 6,000 workers.Sanitary pads and diaper factories used to operate 12 hours a day when the demand boomed, but due to the export obstacles, factories have reduced operating hours by 4 hours, said Adhikari.According to the Department of Customs, Nepal exported 201.99 million pieces of sanitary pads and diapers worth Rs719 million to India in the last fiscal year, ending mid-July.Likewise, a big consignment of Goldstar shoes failed to get export clearance after India refused to issue the BIS certificate, putting Nepal’s homegrown shoemaker on the brink.Exporters said there were rumours on Friday that India had extended the deadline to obtain a BIS certificate, and the Nepali exporters were allowed to export goods with their existing certificates.“But we have not received any formal notice from the Indian authority on the time extension of the BIS certificate,” said Baburam Adhikari, spokesperson for the Ministry of Industry, Commerce and Supplies. “If the BIS had made such a decision, we would have been informed.”“Neither the BIS India nor the domestic industries has confirmed or communicated with us on the issue.”After Nepali exports were halted over the BIS issue, the industry ministry has written multiple times to its Indian counterpart. Meetings were held, and the issue was forwarded even during Industry Minister Damodar Bhandari’s visit to India in August. “However, there is no progress,” said Adhikari. Adhikari said none of the Nepali exporters who applied for the BIS certificate have gotten it till now.“The BIS certificate issue has put the industries in Rupandehi in a big dilemma. They were opened to export goods to India,” said Thakur Kumar Shrestha, president of the Siddhartha Chamber of Commerce and Industry. It has negatively impacted both the industries and Nepal’s trade.Shrestha said factories are either running at half capacity or getting shut down, and workers are being laid off. Exports from the cement makers in Rupandehi—such as Arghakhanchi Cement, Sarbottam Cement, Palpa Cement, and Balaji Cement—have completely stopped for nearly two months.“Even as the domestic consumption of cement declined, production was not impacted due to the huge demand from India. But now cement plants in Rupandehi are on the verge of shutting down or running under-capacity,” said Shrestha.Except plywood, the export of all the listed goods that require a BIS certificate has come to a halt, said Shrestha. “India has neither renewed the certificate nor provided a new one.”Goods under the BIS with compulsory certification are any variety of cement manufactured or sold in India, steel and iron products, chemicals, fertiliser, polymers and textiles, cables, flat transparent sheet glass, cattle feed, footwear, centrifugally cast (spun) iron pipes, jute bags, viscose staple fibres, geo textiles, portable water bottles, plywood, and wooden flush door shutters, among others.“Plywood is currently not restricted. But despite having already paid the BIS charges and completed the process, the inspection team from India has not provided a BIS certificate for Nepali goods,” said Hom Prasad Ghimire, president of the Nepal Plywood Manufacturers Association. Ghimire said that his company completed the process of getting the BIS certificate in June. He said the Nepali plywood is of better quality than the Indian plywood.Plywood has been given until March 2025 for certification-free export. He said that out of 80 plywood factories, 52 have even deposited charges to obtain the certificate. The plywood industry employs 25,000 workers across the country.According to the association, Nepal exported Rs8 billion worth of plywood to India. The volume could have increased had the exports not been interrupted.Trade with India has been repeatedly obstructed. Experts say there is a need to seek long-term solutions for uninterrupted trade with the southern neighbour. “There must be a mutual recognition agreement on select exportable items. Under such an agreement, exportable goods certified by the government will be recognised by the Indian government. This would be the best long-term solution for standard certification,” said Posh Raj Pandey, chairman of the South Asia Watch of Economics, Environment and Trade.Under the 2009 bilateral trade agreement with Nepal, India agreed to support the setting up of standard-purpose labs, said Pandey. However, Nepal has not been able to push for the labs during talks with India— even after 15 years of the agreement. He said lack of coordination among government agencies and frequent changes of bureaucrats have put the issue on the back burner. \nThe US has just concluded our generation's most eagerly watched presidential elections. Donald J Trump has won the White House resoundingly, and in addition, the Republican Party, also known as the Grand Old Party, has now wrested control of the Senate and has a comfortable majority in Congress. Simply put, Trump and the GOP now have complete control of the executive and legislative branches of the government, which will embolden the new Trump administration to pursue policies with determination. The world is closely watching how the Trump administration will usher in a new foreign policy paradigm that revolves around Trump’s “America First” philosophy. Foreign policy mandarins across the globe have mixed feelings about Trump's victory: Allies in Europe are gripped with anxiety, whereas in South Asia, there is a sense that since the rhetoric of Trump’s election campaign focused on combating China, Asia is on the cusp of witnessing unprecedented American engagement. It is in this context of American outreach in Asia that South Asia will play a pivotal role in shaping outcomes of a constantly evolving new world order. Nepal must remain steadfast in keeping up with developments of the great power games whilst constantly safeguarding and pursuing its interests independently. The heart of the US’s contention with China revolves around two critical issues: Trade and technology. The Covid-19 pandemic demonstrated to the world how global trade supply chains depended on supply lines in China. With the resurgence of the America First policy, the Trump administration is determined to impose new trade tariffs of up to 60 percent on Chinese exports. While the supposed new tariffs are likely to come into play in the second half of 2025, there is palpable fear that new trade tariffs could bring in disruptions to global trade as costs are likely to increase in the coming days. The Trump administration is determined to create new jobs to revitalise the economy by incentivising manufacturing in the country. Whilst Trump's plan to re-establish the US as a manufacturing hub is seen as a patriotic move, could higher labour costs in a developed country contribute towards lower production costs? The US’s trade conflict with China presents other developing nations in Asia with a unique opportunity to attract investments in the manufacturing industry. Although it is outlandish to suggest China will be entirely substituted as a manufacturing hub, the emergence of new manufacturing opportunities in the global south presents the US with the opportunity to fuel economic growth essential for the sustenance of democracy. South Asia gives the US a unique avenue for enhanced collaboration. With a democratic polity spread across most of South Asia’s landmass, job creation and energy production are the key elements for stability in the region. The Indo-Gangetic delta is among the most populous regions in the world and possesses the human capital to fuel economic growth across South Asia. Although the Civilian Nuclear Deal between India and the US is a milestone agreement for the use of clean nuclear energy to generate electricity in India, the nuclear plants in India only contribute 3.11 percent of the total electricity generated in India. For India to meet the energy requirements to set up a large-scale industrial base, access to high-quality uninterrupted energy will be critical for industrialisation in India and across South Asia. The Millennium Challenge Corporation pact signed between Nepal and the US is a significant breakthrough in Nepal’s energy sector, as American investment in upgrading transmission line infrastructure is greatly required to transport high-quality, uninterrupted energy.Nepal still requires robust investment in the transmission side to feed supply lines across South Asia. The fact that Nepal, Bangladesh and India have signed a power trade agreement demonstrates the potential of Nepal’s energy sector in fuelling energy to propel economic growth in the region. South Asia missed the industrial flight back in the decades of the 80s and the 90s; it’s time the region reaped the benefits of the US capital that could trigger a wave of industrialisation. Another focal point of tension between the US and China is the issue of semiconductors. The US would want to retain the technological leadership of high-end chips in the hands of its allies, namely Taiwan, South Korea and the Netherlands. Currently, the world relies solely on Taiwan and its crown jewel, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (TSMC), for high-end chips—TSMC has a market share of 90 percent of advanced chip manufacturing. Both the US and China know the strategic advantage one can gain by accessing high-end chips, which is critical for next-generation AI modelling in sectors such as defence, intelligence, telecom, medicine and aerospace. The ability to store big data also depends on the quality and the advanced functioning of high-end chips. In simple words, the US’s ability to retain control and contain access to high-end chips to compete whilst diversifying the production of low-end chips will provide the US and its allies the political leverage it desperately wants. The tech industry in South Asia has been recognised as a force to reckon with, particularly in India and the periphery of Bangladesh. Sri Lanka seems to have made progress, while Nepal also aspires to expand its tech business reach. Cross-border payments, the expansion of data centres and the use of technology in the delivery of governance are areas of expansive collaboration. India’s ability to produce low-end chips in the future is also critical to expanding the tech industry in South Asia, as indigenously produced chips can help reduce manufacturing costs and the tech industry’s dependency on accessing chips elsewhere, which are always in high demand globally. But there are also areas of concern for South Asia regarding Trump’s ascendency to the White House. Trump has vowed to pull out of the Paris Climate Agreement and climate change is an issue that confronts South Asia, particularly Nepal. Nepal has witnessed firsthand the impacts of climate change and, therefore, the country and South Asia at large cannot afford to ignore the impact of climate change. This issue cannot become secondary for either Nepal or the region. Climate change challenges the livelihoods of our people, and the Government of Nepal must voice its concern visibly and work towards creating strategic alliances that will compel the new US administration to rethink walking away from Paris Climate Agreement. The new US administration and its South Asian partners must work on issues impacting human welfare to achieve wider social and economic participation in the democratic process in the region. Trump’s vision of America First is virtuous, but to restore the US’s trust globally, he must take its allies into confidence.  \nHow big will the impact be as Nepal’s major international airport closes for ten hours starting Friday?Economists say it’s too early to quantify, but the losses for the Nepali economy will be huge.Nepal’s economic momentum has slowed down since the late September floods, and the government’s decision to close the key airport could stifle growth.“It will be a big setback for the country’s ailing economy as it will hit tourism and business activities, including transport, hotels, restaurants, telecommunication and other sectors,” said Bishwambhar Pyakurel, a noted economist. Pyakurel called it a deliberate “restriction” imposed by the government, despite it having many alternatives to carry out construction at the airport.Tickets prices are soaring, with most destinations, including Nepal’s labour markets, witnessing a fourfold price rise due to a widening gap between supply and demand.A notice to airmen, popularly known as NOTAM, issued by the Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal, states that the airport will be closed from 10pm to 8am from Friday for five months, until March 31, to expand the taxiways. The airport is currently closed from 2am to 6am. Two parallel taxiway projects are ongoing at the Tribhuvan International Airport in Kathmandu. The extension of the parallel taxiway was initially planned in 2009.Travel trade entrepreneurs said the civil aviation body’s mismanagement could shave off at least Rs50 billion in airline and tourism industry revenues, even as the government struggles with revenue generation.The outlooks for 2024-2025 of the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank, and the International Monetary Fund forecast economic recovery on the basis of improved tourist arrivals in Nepal. Growth in food, transport, and accommodation sectors have been better than expected even as other economic indicators lag.In September, the Asian Development Bank revised Nepal’s economic growth forecast upward to 4.9 percent for the current fiscal year beginning mid-July, based on projected agricultural and electricity output growth and buoyant tourist arrivals.The National Statistics Office’s annual account estimated that accommodation and food service activities, which are linked to tourism, would see a robust growth of 21.84 percent, the highest among 18 economic compositions in the Nepali economy, in the last fiscal year ended mid-July.According to the respective ministries, the late monsoon floods and landslides affected agriculture and electricity output, and now tourism has received a big jolt.It will be more painful for domestic airlines as winter will bring more fog and pollution, curtailing flight frequencies.“It’s an unplanned construction,” said Pyakurel. “Today, time is money. For trading, business and leisure, coming to Nepal will be a big challenge,” he said, adding that the airfares are so high that tourists and businessmen will think twice before flying. Hoteliers say that due to high ticket prices, key events planned in Kathmandu have either been postponed or cancelled.As part of the improvement plan, a 1,140-metre-long parallel taxiway is being built on the runway’s southern side, or the Koteshwar end. This will connect the existing international apron to the end of runway 02.Similarly, another 450-metre-long parallel taxiway is being built at the northern end of the runway.Considering the planned infrastructure, the maximum runway capacity will see 42 aircraft movements per hour in mixed-mode operation, enabling 187,000 aircraft movements per year from the 128,449 flight movements last year. In 2023, the Kathmandu airport recorded 8.7 million passengers—4.54 million international air travellers and 4.15 million domestic ones, according to statistics of the Tribhuvan International Airport.Similarly, in terms of flight movement, the airport handled 128,449 flight movements—31,460 flights by international airlines and 96,989 by domestic carriers.Travel trade entrepreneurs say the ill-planned construction would take way too long, extending until another peak tourism season in spring (March).“These will be painful months for travel trade entrepreneurs as the plan is being implemented in the peak tourism season. We, however, cannot oppose the airport’s infrastructure development,” said Sagar Pandey, president of the Trekking Agencies Association of Nepal.“On different occasions, we have suggested that the government and the civil aviation body find alternatives to such a long closure, such as incentivising airlines to fly from Bhairahawa and Pokhara international airports.”However, international airlines are hesitant to connect to the new airports, which have remained idle for months due to the technical and financial issues of flying to them.Pandey said they might lose at least 40 percent of trekkers this year considering the flight cancellations.Nepal Tourism Board has revised its 2024 tourist arrival forecast to 1.1 million from the projected 1.3 million. As of October, Nepal has received 900,000 tourists.Some entrepreneurs say that five hours of construction time, as it used to be, was appropriate, but insiders suspect that a 10-hour closure would force many airlines to divert to Bhairahawa. For instance, on October 27, the Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal (CAAN) took action against a Thai AirAsia flight, refusing to allow it to land at Kathmandu airport.Media reports show that the flight was later permitted. However, after the plane landed, authorities temporarily suspended the airline and its general sales agent. Later the restrictions were lifted on the “condition” that the airline would fly from Bhairahawa as well. Airline officials say the “punitive measure” was not the aviation regulator’s first action. On October 30, 2022, the CAAN cancelled Nepal Airlines’ scheduled flight to Delhi as punishment for defying instructions to move some of its international services to the newly-built Bhairahawa airport.Nepal Airlines’ jet remained on the ground, and more than 500 passengers were affected by the last-minute cancellation.“I would like to seriously draw the attention of the government that Tribhuvan International Airport is being closed for 10 hours daily from November 8 to March 31. It cannot be considered normal to close an international airport for 10 hours to build structures. Earlier, during the rehabilitation of the main runway, the airport was closed only for 5/7 hours at night,” lawmaker Udaya Shumsher Rana wrote on X on October 29.“It is clear that closing the Kathmandu airport means diverting flights to Pokhara and Bhairahawa to show that those two airports are fine. There are technical reasons behind international airlines not being ready to fly to these two airports. Undoubtedly, the Civil Aviation Authority leadership is trying to hide its weaknesses by closing the Kathmandu airport for 10 hours.”Rana argued that if this decision is not revised, Nepal’s global image and tourism business would suffer. The airport closure will also hit domestic flights. Buddha Air, Nepal’s largest domestic carrier, currently operates 180 daily flights. As the airline must reduce its flights to 135, there will be a substantial drop in its revenue and government’s taxes. Some other domestic airlines have complained to the regulator that flight allocation is not proportionate under the new arrangement. \n\n\nNepal-India relations amidst the 2015 constitution promulgation, blockade, and regional geopolitics are discussed, along with India's perceptions of Nepali communist parties and its evolving neighbourhood policy.\nKunwar, former Amazon employee, leads Daraz Nepal as MD, discussing e-commerce opportunities and challenges in Nepal's business environment.\nAn arrest warrant is issued against Rastriya Swatantra Party President Rabi Lamichhane and 13 others for cooperative fraud in various districts, leading to investigations and street protests by his supporters.\nA dispute between the House Speaker and the Janamat Party over the removal of a party lawmaker, Goma Labh Sapkota, has escalated, sparking accusations of criminality and racism, with the parliament secretariat defending the Speaker's decision.\nDespite RPP leader Rajendra Lingden's prediction of electoral success, the party failed to win any of the 41 local level posts in recent by-elections, prompting internal criticism and questions about his leadership.\nNepali Congress wins the most seats in local by-elections, but loses some previously held positions to CPN-UML and CPN (Maoist Centre), while RSP and NMKP emerge as new players at the local level.\nNepal's Prime Minister Oli, during his official visit to China, met with Chinese leaders, signed project agreements, and discussed Belt and Road Initiative cooperation and economic assistance.\nThe Nepal Election Commission is holding local level by-elections for 41 vacant positions on Sunday.

According to Aryal, those whose names are included in the final voter list can cast their votes showing the original proof of voter identity card, Nepali citizenship certificate, national identity card, passport, driving licence or permanent account number card.Commission officials expect higher voter turnout compared to earlier elections. According to an officer at the commission, the election body analysed some lapses in the past elections and fixed them. “We believe the turnout will be higher this time,” says an official.Counting of votes will begin immediately after the voting is completed, and all the ballot boxes will be collected at the designated counting centres. The commission has said that the count can be followed on its website.The commission plans to announce the final by-election results within two days.“We expect to use a helicopter to collect ballot boxes of Gaurishankar Rural Municipality of Dolakha due to the difficult geography of the village,” Durga Prasad Chalise, the deputy spokesperson for the commission said.“It may take some time to collect ballot boxes in Sarkegad Rural Municipality of Humla and Swamikartik Khapar Rural Municipality of Bajura, but other than that, we will have no problem starting vote counting immediately.”The commission is holding by-elections as per the legal provision. According to the Local Level Election Act-2017, if the position of the district coordination committee chief, deputy chief, rural municipality chairman, vice-chairman, municipality mayor, deputy mayor and ward chair fall vacant for any reason before the end of their term and if more than a year of their term remains, the remaining term will be filled through a by-election.The elections are being held only to elect 41 representatives at local units but political parties have given priority to the by-polls as if it is going to be a test of their strength.Even top politicians such as CPN (Maoist Centre) chair Pushpa Kamal Dahal, Nepali Congress general secretaries Gagan Thapa and Bishwa Prakash Sharma and CPN-UML General Secretary Shankar Pokharel, among other influential leaders, were actively involved in election campaigns in favour of their candidates.Some reckon people could express their disenchantment towards traditional parties because of their inability to deliver on governance. But Uddhab Pyakurel, an assistant professor at the Kathmandu University, said the by-elections can’t be seen as a voice of the Nepali people at large.Pyakurel thinks that regular elections are different to by-elections and by-elections results seldom reflect on future election results.Sunday’s by-elections are taking place only for the 41 posts of certain local units. There are 753 local units (276 municipalities and 460 rural municipalities), further divided into 6,743 wards.“So the results of the 41 local contests are insufficient to draw definite conclusions about the future,” Pyakurel said. It could be an indicator to analyse anti-incumbency if the parties lose the seats that they had won earlier, he added. “However, the results themselves cannot be considered a solid basis to gauge the future poll performance of political parties.”Out of the 44 seats for which by-elections are being held on Sunday, 30 were won by the Congress in the earlier local polls while seven seats each were won by the UML and the Maoist Centre. \nNepali Congress candidate Krishnaman Dangol has been elected mayor of Kirtipur Municipality in the by-election held on Sunday. Dangol secured 5,334 votes, defeating his closest rival, Shivsharan Maharjan of the Maoist Centre, by 779 votes.Maharjan received 4,555 votes, while Surendra Manandhar of the CPN-UML garnered 4,337 votes.The by-election was held following the demise of former mayor Rajkumar Nakarmi, who passed away on July 26 last year due to a kidney-related illness. Nakarmi, also from the Congress, was elected Mayor in the 2022 local elections.Kirtipur, historically known as a left-leaning stronghold, saw a shift in political dynamics with Nakarmi’s victory in 2022. Kirtipur was declared a municipality in 1997. \nKrishnaman Dangol of the Nepali Congress has maintained a lead in the ongoing vote count for the mayor of Kirtipur Municipality. As of the latest tally, Dangol has garnered 789 votes, while Surendra Manandhar of the CPN-UML trails with 666 votes. Shivsharan Maharjan of the CPN (Maoist Centre) has received 465 votes. Among independent candidates, Rajman Maharjan has secured 418 votes, Dinesh Kumar Adhikari 236, and Kabikumar Maharjan 58. Rastriya Prajatantra Party’s Dhruba Maharjan has obtained 119 votes, while Bhanu Rijal of the CPN (Unified Socialist) has 22 votes.   \nRojina Shrestha of the Rastriya Swatantra Party has been elected ward chair of Kathmandu Metropolitan City-16, securing 2,902 votes.According to the Election Commission, Laxmiratna Tuladhar of the UML came second with 2,220 votes, while Congress candidate Devendra Pathak finished third with 2,214 votes. Unified Socialist’s Min Bahadur Manandhar received 1,092 votes, and Shyam Krishna Shrestha of the Rastriya Prajatantra Party secured 774 votes. A total of 10,558 votes were cast, with 180 declared invalid. The by-election was held following the death of Mukunda Rijal, elected ward chair in 2022 with 4,018 votes from Congress. \nA man accused of threatening Nepali businesspersons by claiming to be a member of the Indian criminal gang Lawrence Bishnoi, has been arrested. The arrested is Harichandra Phuyal alias Navin Pradhan, 36, a resident of Panchthar, and currently residing in ward 13 of Mechinagar Municipality, Jhapa.According to police, Phuyal used Indian phone numbers to make calls and send messages to businesspersons, claiming to represent the gang. He allegedly terrorised them by demanding they apologise to controversial medical entrepreneur Durga Prasai, warning of dire consequences, including threats to their lives. The Central Investigation Bureau (CIB) apprehended Pradhan in Charaali, Jhapa, on Wednesday evening. Police investigations revealed that Pradhan acted under Prasai’s instructions. Authorities said Pradhan has a history of criminal involvement and was previously on the run. Two mobile phones were seized during the arrest, and further investigation is ongoing.  \nPolice have arrested two individuals on charges of fraudulently promising foreign employment.A police team from the Kathmandu Valley Crime Investigation Office arrested 39-year-old Suvarna Kumar Bal of Bakaiya Rural Municipality-5 in Makwanpur and 28-year-old Manisha Kumari of Brahmapuri Rural Municipality-3 in Sarlahi.According to the complaints with the police, Suvarna had promised to send one individual to Croatia, collecting Rs1.5 million, while Manisha had promised to send another person to Dubai, collecting Rs245,000. Both individuals went into hiding after taking the money.Suvarna was arrested from Bafal on Monday, and Manisha was apprehended from Gongabu Bus Park area, Kathmandu on Tuesday. They have been sent to the Department of Foreign Employment in Tahachal for further investigation and action. \nThe Asian Development Bank (ADB) launched a photo exhibition to celebrate over five decades of partnership with Nepal in the energy sector—a collaboration that has been instrumental in driving the country’s development and energy transformation.State Minister for Energy, Water Resources and Irrigation Purna Bahadur Tamang and ADB Country Director for Nepal Arnaud Cauchois inaugurated the exhibition. “We take immense pride in our role as one of the key partners in Nepal’s clean energy transformation,” said Cauchois. “Our collaboration with the Government of Nepal and other development partners has led to significant improvements in electrification, enhancing the quality of life of Nepalis across the country.”The partnership between ADB and Nepal began in 1972 with the funding for a transmission line project. Since then, ADB has played a critical role in its energy sector, supporting hydroelectric power generation, nearly half of the country’s transmission lines, and over one-third of its 33-kilovolt distribution substations. This has enabled Nepal to generate more clean energy than ever before, meeting growing power demands, improving energy security, and setting the stage for surplus power exports.In this partnership of over 50 years, ADB has achieved many firsts in Nepal’s energy sector. ADB supported landmark projects such as the 60-megawatt Khimti hydropower plant, Nepal’s first large public-private sector investment, and the 144-megawatt Kali Gandaki “A” hydropower project, which have been pivotal in boosting energy production. Current focus areas include storage projects, like the 140-megawatt Tanahu hydropower project, and the diversification of renewable energy sources, such as solar photovoltaic systems and rural microgrids, ensuring clean energy access for all.ADB has also supported reforms in the Nepal Electricity Authority to improve operational performance and efficiency. Beyond infrastructure development, ADB recognises that gender equality and social inclusion are integral to achieving sustainable energy for all.“ADB will continue to support the Government of Nepal and work with development partners to strengthen further the energy sector and support Nepal's energy transition by promoting clean energy, climate adaptation, and a sustainable business model that attracts diverse investments, including private sector financing,” said Cauchois.A week-long special photo exhibition, organised in collaboration with the Photojournalists Club of Nepal, will be held at the Nepal Art Council in Kathmandu from Tuesday and in Janakpur from December 12-18. \nNepali officials were paid $2.5 million in bribes to seal the contract for the $209.6-million Airbus deal, the largest in Nepal’s aviation history, charging documents filed in the US court show.Deepak Sharma, a former executive of the US-based aviation services provider AAR, pleaded guilty in July earlier this year to conspiracy to violate the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) anti-bribery provisions. The charges were based on allegations that Sharma was part of a conspiracy to bribe Nepali officials to secure two Airbus A330 deals in 2017.Sharma pleaded guilty and agreed to forfeit around $130,000. His sentences are yet to be determined, so this case is ongoing.Sharma, a Nepal-born British citizen, joined AAR in 2015. Before this, he was the chief technical officer at AJW Group, which he joined in 2008. He has also been the engineering director at UK International Airlines.According to the documents in this case obtained by the Post, between November 2015 and August 2018, Sharma conspired with others to pay bribes to Nepali officials to win a bid to sell two Airbus A330-200 aircraft on behalf of AAR Corp to Nepal Airlines Corporation.On June 24, 2024, the US Department of Justice alleged that Sharma—as an agent for AAR—conspired to bribe Nepali officials and filed a single count of information under seal in the District of Columbia, alleging a conspiracy to violate the FCPA’s anti-bribery provisions.In July, guilty pleas were publicly revealed, five years after AAR disclosed possible FCPA violations. The court unsealed the case on August 1, 2024, in connection with a plea agreement.In December 2016, Nepal Airlines selected a group consisting of AAR Corp, German Aviation Capital, and Hi Fly (airline) of Portugal to purchase two widebody aircraft. The month before, according to the investigation transcript, Sharma sent a text message to a conspirator, stating: “I am having dinner with the head of the evaluation committee now. We are discussing how to throw others out even if they come below our bid. See you tomorrow.”In an Information filed, the US Department of Justice alleged that Sharma, on behalf of AAR, agreed to bribe Nepali officials to manipulate the deal in favour of AAR and a German aircraft leasing and trading company, working with a Nepali intermediary and an unnamed co-conspirator [a director of an affiliate of the German company] to facilitate a sham transaction between the German aircraft company and Nepal Airlines.The Information describes Sharma’s email and text communications, as well as invoices and wire transfer records, which record payments made by the German company's Ireland-based Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) to a United Arab Emirates-based bank account used by the Nepali intermediary to fund bribes to Nepali officials. In Nepal, on April 4, the Commission for Investigation of Abuse of Authority (CIAA), the constitutional anti-graft body, completed its five-year probe into the Airbus deal, concluding that procuring two wide-body Airbus A330 jets caused a loss of Rs1.47 billion ($13.38 million) to the government.The loss was computed based on the exchange rate at the time of the last instalment payment in 2018.The CIAA filed a case against 32 individuals at the Special Court for their alleged corruption in the deal, commonly known as the ‘wide-body scam’. The court is expected to issue a verdict within this month.The first of the two wide-body aircraft, Annapurna, arrived at the Tribhuvan International Airport in June 2018. The second, Makalu, came a month later.In a statement, the commission said it had filed the case against a former minister, high-level sitting and retired government officials, private sector representatives, and aircraft suppliers.The accused are former tourism minister Jeevan Bahadur Shahi, former managing director of Nepal Airlines Sugat Ratna Kansakar, former tourism secretary Shankar Adhikari and former finance secretary Shishir Kumar Dhungana.At the time of the deal, Adhikari and Dhungana were on the board of the national flag carrier.In charging documents filed in the US court, Sharma is described as an “agent” of Company 1 (a reference to AAR).“It was the purpose of the conspiracy for Sharma and his co-conspirators to illegally benefit Company 1, Subsidiary 1 [a wholly-owned subsidiary of Company 1], and others by bribing Nepali officials, including Foreign Official 1 [a Nepali citizen who served as a high-level official at Nepal Airlines Corporation from at least approximately 2015 through 2019] in order to win a bid to sell two Airbus A330-200 aircraft to the state-owned national carrier.”Sharma and his co-conspirators made and received wire transfers intended, in part, as bribes for Nepali officials in connection with Nepal Airlines Corporation transactions, using bank accounts in the United States, Ireland, and the United Arab Emirates, among other places.Sharma and his co-conspirators attempted to disguise the wire transfers as legitimate business transactions by entering into sham agreements between Subsidiary 2 [a wholly-owned subsidiary of Company 1], Company 2 [an aircraft leasing and trading company based in Germany], and Company 3 [a special purpose vehicle incorporated in Ireland and managed by Company 2] on the one hand, and Companies 4 [a Hong Kong incorporated company used by Intermediary] and 5 [a United Arab Emirates incorporated company used by Intermediary] on the other. Some payments were made under sham invoices sent by Sharma and his co-conspirators from Companies 4 and 5 and directed to Company 3. The invoices falsely referred to the bribe payments as “advances”.“In total, between in or around May and August 2018, Company 3 paid Company 5 the equivalent of approximately $2,500,000 in connection with Nepal Airlines transaction, a portion of which Sharma understood would be distributed as bribes to Nepali officials, including Foreign Official 1.”On or about March 29, 2016, approximately six months before Nepal Airlines publicly issued a Request for Proposal (RFP) for the purchase of two A330s, Sharma forwarded an email to two executives at Company 1 containing a draft RFP that was circulated among Nepal Airlines Corporation officials, including Foreign Official 1. In his email to the two executives at Company 1, Sharma stated, “Please find attached Draft RFP[.] NOTE: [T]his [is] not published yet, and it is strictly for three of us [a Company 1 executive], you and I, to comment and change any terms to suit [Company 1]. Let me know if you want any changes made to the payment terms or bid terms so that it favours [Company 1]. I can ask these to be incorporated [sic] into the RFP for publication. I am meeting with the [Foreign Official 1] and Chairman this week…”On or about September 1, 2016, approximately one month before Nepal Airlines Corporation publicly issued the RFP, Foreign Official 1 sent an email to Sharma, writing, “What I have in mind is that we will specify MOU signing date, purchase agreement date and delivery date in such a way that [a competitor of Company 1] cannot meet delivery dates.“Following are tentative dates, and I want your feedback on whether you can meet delivery dates… Tentative dates I fixed but not yet shared with other Nepal Airlines executives…”On October 30, 2016, Foreign Official 1 texted Sharma, “[N]o need to worry at all. Almost all higher-ups are in our pocket.”On May 15, 2018, Sharma sent Individual 1 a text message about Intermediary and Foreign Official 1 pressuring to pay Company 5’s invoice, writing, “The Nepali guys is [sic] chasing like hell.”On May 17, 2018, Sharma sent an email to Individual 1 with an attached invoice from Company 5 to Company 3 for $450,000 for “Service Provided for Bid and Sale of X2A330 as an Advance.”On July 3, 2018, Individual 1 and others caused a wire transfer of approximately 390,000 EURO (the equivalent of roughly $450,000) from Company 3’s bank account in Ireland to Company 5’s bank account in the United Arab Emirates, in part for the benefit of Nepali officials, including Foreign Official 1On August 9, 2018, the Intermediary emailed Sharma, attaching two invoices from Company 5 to Company 3 for $1,000,000 each for “Service Provided for Bid and sale of X2 A330 as an Advance.”On August 10, 2018, Individual 1 and others caused two wire transfers of approximately $1,000,000 each from Company 3’s bank account in Ireland to Company 5’s bank account in the United Arab Emirates, partly for the benefit of Nepali officials, including Foreign Official 1. \nPrime Minister KP Sharma Oli, leading a high-level delegation, departed for Beijing on Monday via a special diplomatic flight operated by Himalaya Airlines.The President of Himalaya Airlines, Zhou Enyong, welcomed the prime minister on board. The delegation is set to return to Nepal on December 5 on Himalaya’s Airbus 319. Vijay Shrestha, Vice President of the airline, said, “It is a great honour for us to serve the nation by operating special flights for the official travel of the head of the government.” The Airbus A319, registered as 9N-AJK, departed Tribhuvan International Airport at 11:16 NST and landed at Beijing Capital International Airport at 18:03 local time.   \nEminent city doctors and health experts today gave a call for caution, mass awareness and improved government policies to minimise the use of microplastics that can cause several health hazards, including cancer.Tiny plastic particles that are less than 5 mm are called microplastics and are being attributed to severe respiratory diseases or even some types of cancer. According to Dr Monidipa Mondal, an eminent radiation oncologist, when microplastics enter the body through food or other sources, they first encounter the immune cells. “Being micro-mini in size, they can easily enter the immune cells after which a biochemical agent called cyclophane is released. The cyclophanes prepare chronic information inside the cells. “As we know if chronic information continues to get stored in the cells, it can lead to cancer. Apart from this, cancer is also related to free radicals. Therefore, it also creates oxidative stress in the cells and free radicals in the cells due to which cell multiplication occurs,” informed the doctor.As reiterated by Dr Mondal, recent studies have revealed an increased number of colorectal cancers among people. “It has been found in some studies that microplastics could be a possible driver of colorectal cancer. Another observation reveals a link between breast cancer and microplastic. We have also heard about BPA-free plastic. BPA or Bisphenol-A is an agent that can mimic estrogen. In some cancer cases, estrogen has been found. It can, therefore, be said that if it can mimic estrogen, it could also be a possible cause of breast cancer,” she added.According to research by India Clean Air Network (India CAN), degraded plastic from waste and wastewater discharge due to inefficient treatment processes are two of the major sources of microplastics in West Bengal entering the human body in various ways. The health experts recommended stronger and improved government policies to curb the menace of plastic. As pointed out by Professor Sadhan K Ghosh, mass awareness, particularly among young students is the need of the hour. “The first need is waste segregation. Second, the governance should be such that microplastics are not created for which legislation and its implementation must be done. Also, as plastic becomes brittle and enters our body while swimming or is even consumed by fish that we eat, littering sea beaches should be prohibited,” pointed out the professor.-In Association with ANN \nThe Kathmandu Metropolitan City has started providing ultrasound services free of cost to needy patients from its urban health promotion centres.Officials at the health department of the city office said that 10 out of 32 urban health promotion centres have already started providing services, and an additional five will also start the services within a month.“Any patient from any part of the country, if they are in Kathmandu metropolis, can receive the service,” said Deepak Kumar KC, chief of the health department of the metropolis. “We do not charge anyone any amount.”KMC officials said that ultrasound is a free basic health service the city office is committed to providing. However, patients must pay at least Rs400 for the services in the big hospitals and private clinics and hospitals charge additional amounts.Doctors recommend patients an ultrasound for various diagnoses, including finding the cause of pain and swelling, monitoring the growth and development of the fetus, and looking for blockages, among others.Officials say patients can bring prescriptions from other hospitals or doctors at urban health promotion centres for services.Along with ultrasound service, the city office has been providing physiotherapy services free of cost from all its 32 urban health promotion centres.The metropolis has also been working on setting up laboratories in all of its 32 urban health promotion centres.KC said that due to the lack of laboratory services in most urban health clinics, patients have been forced to seek services at state-run hospitals and private centres, which are often overcrowded and expensive. According to him, lab services will also be free to the patients.The city office runs 32 urban health promotion centres, one in each ward of the metropolis. The metropolis had recently opened vacancies to hire 108 staffers, including 32 physiotherapists, 29 lab technicians, four medical officers, five staff nurses, 10 radiographers, 10 pharmacy assistants, and 26 peons for the urban health clinics.The city office provides 98 types of essential medicines—for communicable and non-communicable diseases, including high blood pressure, diabetes, mental health, heart disease, asthma, cholesterol, and respiratory problems—free of cost.Patients with government health insurance can get over 300 types of medicines from urban health clinics, according to health officials.Earlier, KMC provided mental health screening training to doctors and paramedics at urban health promotion centres. Officials hoped the move would help hundreds of mental health patients in the city get timely treatment.Officials say that they are also planning to provide free medication to patients with mental health problems.Although neither the federal government agency nor the city office has data on the number of people suffering from mental health problems in the metropolis, doctors estimated that many residents could be suffering from various forms of mental health problems including anxiety and depression, among others.Health workers say that many city residents, despite having mental health problems, do not seek treatment and instead turn to drugs and substances to cope. Due to entrenched social stigma, fear of discrimination, and other factors, many patients in Nepal do not openly discuss their mental health issues.The metropolis has upgraded its urban health clinics to urban health promotion centres and started providing services through medical doctors. “Currently, we have medical doctors in all 32 urban health promotion centres,” said Dr Dibas Neupane of the metropolis. “We have been working to make our health service more effective.”The city office has also started campaigns in its jurisdiction to raise awareness of health hazards. The health department has started deploying health workers in various wards to examine sugar, blood pressure, and kidney function. “We have prepared a calendar for the health campaign every month,” said Neupane. “Health workers will visit the densely populated areas at least eight days a month to examine the health condition of locals. We hope that campaigns will help make people aware of their health and inspire behaviour change.” \nThough winter has already set in and the minimum temperature has dropped to seven degrees Celsius, the scourge of dengue-spreading mosquitoes continues unabated. Officials at the Ministry of Health and Population said that even though the number of infections from the deadly virus has declined, people are still contracting the disease.“Like in the previous year, we have not expected zero dengue cases in any particular month,” said Dr Gokarna Dahal, chief of the Vector Control Section at the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division. “New cases of dengue infection are still being reported from various districts.”Dengue is a mosquito-borne disease transmitted by female Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes. The same vector also transmits chikungunya, yellow fever, and Zika, according to the World Health Organisation.Post-monsoon is considered a high transmission season for dengue, but Nepal has witnessed outbreaks of the deadly disease since the start of the year and in the pre-monsoon and monsoon seasons as well.Entomologists say that even if dengue spread slows naturally in the winter, the risk of infection with the deadly virus has not lessened, as the daytime maximum temperature suits virus-spreading vectors to get active.“In summer, Aedes mosquitoes bite people in the morning and evening, but in winter, they become active during the daytime when temperatures rise,” said Sishir Panta, an entomologist. “And we should not forget that even though the growth of the virus-spreading vectors slows down in winter due to cold, it does not stop.”Thirteen people have died, and over 34,000 have been infected since January 2024, according to government data. The virus has spread in all 77 districts across the country. Experts say reported dengue cases may only represent a small fraction of the true scale of the outbreak, as around 90 percent of the infected people do not show any symptoms and health authorities often underreport deaths and infections.Many people infected with dengue show mild symptoms, which do not need any treatment or can be managed with paracetamol at home.As there is no specific treatment for dengue, health workers provide symptomatic care and diagnose patients based on symptoms, including platelet-rich plasma transfusion.According to experts, dengue became endemic in Nepal years ago, meaning that people get infected throughout the year.“New cases could surge once temperatures rise,” said Panta. “Also, the general public should not be complacent, as the risk has not been over. Prevention measures are essential to preventing the spread.”Experts say the disease will not stop spreading unless the lessons and experiences gained in previous outbreaks are implemented. Dengue-transmitting mosquitoes breed in clean water and bite people in daylight. Uncovered water tanks and discarded objects such as plastic cups and bottles could be breeding grounds for dengue-carrying mosquitoes.According to doctors, mild to high fever, severe muscle pain, rashes, severe headache and pain in the eyes are some symptoms of dengue. Doctors advise that those with these symptoms should seek immediate treatment. While there is no specific cure for the disease, early detection and access to proper medical care can lower fatalities.Nepal reported its first dengue case in a foreigner in 2004 in the Chitwan district. Since then, an increasing number of dengue infections, including major outbreaks, have been reported from many districts. The World Health Organisation (WHO) says there is no specific treatment for severe dengue, but early detection and access to proper medical care can save lives. \nA few days ago, a 50-year-old from Kaski district reached the emergency ward of a local hospital for treatment of abdominal pain. The woman, who was living with HIV, told the doctor about her condition before the start of treatment.“Then the behaviour of doctors and other health workers changed abruptly,” Puja Kunwar, programme manager of YKP Lead Nepal, quoted the woman as saying. “They also asked her to purchase separate gloves, masks and other items for the health workers. The behaviour of the health workers towards the woman, who has been working to lessen stigma and discrimination for the last two decades, was outrageous.”Although new data provided by the Ministry of Health and Population shows there has been satisfactory progress in reducing the HIV infection rate and deaths in Nepal, deep-rooted social stigma has not lessened as expected.YKP Lead Nepal, an organisation formed to engage with young people who use drugs, men who have sex with men, people living with HIV/AIDS, migrant workers, and sex workers, says that infected people are still being stigmatised in society.“Infected children are denied their rights to enroll in schools; adults are losing jobs solely because of their HIV status,” said Kunwar. “And these problems are not limited to a particular place, but are pervasive across the country. Due to similar discriminatory behaviours, many infected people do not dare to reveal their HIV status to family members and society.”The deep-rooted stigma against the disease is the main reason for concealing the disease condition, avoiding testing and treatment for a long time, or discontinuing medication, according to experts. They say that infected people cannot tell their spouse(s) about their disease conditions, and it becomes equally difficult for their spouses to readily accept the situation. As a result, many people conceal their disease condition, transmit the disease to their partners, and seek treatment only after their health deteriorates, say experts.“Even though the infection rate and deaths from HIV have declined substantially, we have not been able to make progress in lessening stigma and discrimination,” said Lok Raj Pandey, information officer at the National Centre for AIDS and STD Control.“Stigma against HIV-infected people is deep-seated in communities, which will not end easily.”It is also possible for HIV-infected women to give birth to a baby who does not have HIV. Similarly, two HIV-positive parents can also have an HIV-negative child, provided that the infected woman starts antiretroviral therapy before pregnancy.Experts say one can also avoid HIV infection by taking pre-exposure prophylaxis within 72 hours of having unsafe sex.Experts say people infected with HIV can live healthy and normal life spans if they get proper treatment. For this, treatment should be started early, and medicines prescribed by doctors should be taken regularly. According to data provided by the Centre, the HIV infection rate in Nepal in 2023 declined by 91 percent compared to 2000. Last year, only 457 people tested positive for HIV, and 231 were estimated to have succumbed to the disease. In the year 2000, some 5,100 infected people were detected, and in 2010, a total of 1,700 deaths were recorded, according to officials.Improved treatment is credited with the decline in the infection and death rate. Doctors say those who regularly use antiretroviral medicine don't pass the disease to others.The health ministry provides antiretroviral therapy free of charge to all people living with HIV. Currently, 25,728 people are receiving antiretroviral treatment (ART). There are 92 operational sites and 46 ART dispensing centres throughout the country.It is estimated that 30,300 people were infected with HIV in Nepal until 2023. Every day, at least one person gets infected with HIV in the country.  \nDusit Princess Kathmandu is organising a five-day trout festival at its SOI restaurant. The dishes will be available for order from 12:30 pm to 10:00 pm every day till August 30. In celebration of Nepal’s rivers and lakes, which provide an ideal environment for high-quality trout, the Director of Culinary Food and Beverage Service, Chef Utpal Mondal, and his team at Dusit Princess Kathmandu have crafted a menu showcasing the flavours and versatility of locally sourced trout. “As the festive month of Shrawan ends, people focus on healthy and nutritious food. Trout, rich in omega-3 fatty acids, vitamins, and essential minerals, offers a heart-friendly option that checks all the boxes from a nutritional and culinary standpoint,” says Mondal.He adds that the goal of the culinary event is to offer their guests a rare opportunity to experience a wide variety of trout dishes they wouldn’t typically find at home.The event menu features twelve unique dishes, six of which are drawn from diverse culinary traditions across continents. Three dishes are inspired by oriental cuisine, while the remaining three highlight flavours from Nepal and India. The menu has been designed to include various dishes, from soups and starters to main courses, including Mexican, Italian, Continental, and Thai flavours.While discussing the event’s highlights, Mondal said, “The celebration presents a unique opportunity for guests to indulge in a diverse range of trout-based dishes, something they wouldn’t typically have the chance to experience elsewhere.” \nI can vividly remember my first encounter with baking when I was 10 years old. We had just moved to our new home and got a cable connection. The cable opened a world of possibilities, as it gave me access to various contents.This was back in the late 2000s when YouTube would take hours to load, taunting us with its buffering screen. I was particularly drawn to travel and lifestyle channels, mainly TLC, Fox Life, and Food Network, which kept me informed about different foods and cultures. I don’t know why, but I was always drawn to desserts. It was fascinating to see how these miraculous treats made people smile at the end of the meal.Growing up in Nepal, I noticed that baking wasn't very common. While some families did have ovens, they were mostly multifunctional ones used primarily for heating food.I also noticed that most of our desserts didn't require an oven, as they could be made on a stovetop. So, you can imagine my excitement when my mom decided to buy an oven during one of her festive shopping sprees.I could finally feel the joy these channels portrayed. (I blame food writer Nigella Lawson for getting me hooked on a domestic lifestyle.) Then, one day, after watching one of the cooking episodes on television, I finally mustered enough strength and decided to bake something. I distinctly remember wanting to make a chocolate cake for myself after watching one of Rachel Allen’s bake series. I watched all the ingredients used in that recipe and scurried across my pantry, only to realise I didn’t have half of the stuff she mentioned. I then decided to improvise the recipe (a big mistake). I randomly combined the ingredients that I had in a mixing bowl and chucked the batter into my oven, hoping for a magical cake to pop out an hour later.After I saw the result an hour later, I was mortified. The cake was stuck in the pan, refusing to come out, and it was as dense as fudge. I convinced myself that the taste was what mattered most, but when I served a slice to my brother, he made a face of utter disgust.That was the day I realised that baking soda was not the same as baking powder.After this incident, I researched baking and found out it was technical. This was a blessing in disguise for me, as I loved science, and I started to view baking as a science experiment. I then reflected and evaluated how to perfect one's baking skills.I analysed my errors and noted down all the steps I did every time I baked. Home baking is a passion for many. The idea of turning a few simple ingredients into a delicious masterpiece is as enchanting as it sounds.Yet, for many of us, this seemingly magical process can often turn into a series of unfortunate events, leading to crumbled dreams and deflated ambitions. Dense cakes, burnt crusts, rock-hard cookies and unrisen bread, if you are an amateur baker, then you have seen it all. But why do these mishaps happen so often? And most importantly how do we overcome them?From my experience, behind every successful bake lies a series of challenges and mishaps that test even the most dedicated bakers. Baking has its own set of rules that you need to follow to get that scrumptious treat every time. So, to transform a recipe into an actual dish that will impress your friends and family, I am sharing with you some of the tips and tricks I learned from my tumultuous journey as a home baker.First things first, we have to look into the prime appliance that we are working with. Commercial ovens are of two types: one that runs on gas and the other that runs on electricity. We have to look at the oven present at our home and consider its pros and cons. The main benefits of a gas oven are its size and temperature control. One can quickly change the temperature just by twisting the knob, and it preheats much more quickly than an electric one. However, they are known to have uneven temperatures at times and release more humidity, making it harder to properly crisp or brown food. This can result in burnt edges and cold or hot spots. An electric oven, on the other hand, provides more even and consistent temperatures and doesn’t release as much moisture in the air.This dry oven environment makes it easier to brown your items, making it great for baking bread. However, while the dry oven results in more even cooking, you also run the risk of drying out cakes and other baked goods.Also, many people forget to preheat the oven before baking, which is crucial for maintaining an even temperature throughout the baking process. When baking cakes and bread, I like to place a small tray of water at the bottom of the oven to provide moisture and prevent the baked goods from drying out.An oven thermometer can be a baker's best friend, providing a true reading and ensuring your creations bake evenly. I also like rotating the pan midway while baking, as it allows for an even distribution of heat.The next thing people mess up on is measuring and the specificity of ingredients in a recipe. Our moms made our food with their instinct; it is something that they learned along the way, but when you are baking, you cannot instinctively add or omit a few steps.I think that is why we initially had problems with baking. In a culture where cooking comes instinctually, baking challenges us, to be precise. A gram of more or less of any ingredient can drastically alter the outcome. Different methods of measuring flour can yield different results.Every component in baking serves a distinct purpose and function. Flour offers structure, sugar adds sweetness and moisture, eggs bind things together, and butter enhances taste and texture. However, not all ingredients are created equally. For example, using salted butter instead of unsalted might change the taste profile of your meal.Similarly, different flours have varying protein concentrations, which affect the texture of baked goods. The type of sugar used also makes a difference. Granulated sugar, brown sugar, powdered sugar, and speciality sugars like turbinado or muscovado each add unique flavours to a bake.Understanding these nuances and how they interact is critical for getting the intended outcomes. Accurate measurement tools and techniques are essential, but mastering them can be a steep learning curve. So, I would recommend investing in a kitchen scale that allows for more accurate measurements by weight rather than volume.Moving on, leavening agents such as baking soda, baking powder, and yeast are required to make baked goods rise. However, they can also cause confusion and errors. Baking soda needs an acidic component to activate, but baking powder has both an acid and a base, making it self-activating.Using the wrong type of flour or sugar, or using them in incorrect proportions, can result in flat, overly raised, or collapsed cakes. Yeast, being a living organism, presents its challenges.The water temperature must be just right—not too hot to kill the yeast, nor too cold to inhibit its activity. Proofing times and conditions also need to be carefully managed to achieve the perfect rise.Bakers should also be careful about the way they mix ingredients. The method of mixing ingredients can significantly impact the final product. Over-mixing can develop too much gluten in cakes and pastries, leading to tough textures.Under-mixing can leave pockets of unincorporated ingredients, resulting in uneven bakes. Techniques like folding, creaming, and whipping each serve specific purposes and must be executed with care.Finally, home bakers must understand the importance of timing and patience in baking. Even a minute or two can make the difference between perfectly baked cookies and burnt edges.Recipes often provide a range for baking times, but factors like oven hot spots, pan material, and altitude can affect these times. It’s crucial to keep a close eye on your bakes and rely on visual and tactile cues, such as a cake pulling away from the sides of the pan or a toothpick coming out clean, to determine doneness.Baking is also an exercise in patience, a virtue not everyone possesses. Doughs need time to rest and rise, flavours need time to meld, and baked goods need time to cool before they can be enjoyed.Impatience can lead to underbaked centres, crumbling slices, and a general sense of frustration. Cultivating patience is as important as mastering any technique in the baker’s repertoire.Home baking is a journey full of ups and downs, but it comes with great rewards. The obstacles encountered teach valuable lessons in patience, precision, and perseverance.The satisfaction of success, the freedom to create, and the therapeutic benefits make the endeavour meaningful. Whether baking for oneself, loved ones, or as an artistic outlet, the journey is as fulfilling as the result. Embrace the flour-dusted countertops, occasional setbacks, and the joys of home bakingFor a beginner-friendly recipe that involves mixing ingredients and delivers amazing results, try my recipe for fudgy, nutty brownies that I call ‘Bliss Brownies’.Bliss Brownies150g unsalted butter plus extra for the tin150g chopped dark chocolate200g caster sugar½ tsp baking powder2 eggs80g cocoa powder150g plain flour70g mixture of nuts (walnuts and almonds)60g blended papayaMix all the ingredients (except the dark chocolate and nuts) in a blender or a food processor and blitz till you get a smooth paste.Fold the chocolate and the nuts into the brownie batter, making sure that the pieces are evenly mixed in.Grease a loaf pan with soft butter and dust with cocoa powder. Pour the batter into the loaf pan.Bake in a preheated oven at 170c for 40 minutes and let it cool in the oven for an hour. Enjoy with a cup of coffee or, as I like it, a scoop of vanilla ice cream. \nIn a world where acceptance and safety often seem difficult to attain, many queer individuals also struggle to find a safe space to express themselves. They have to hide their true self and face relentless judgement when going to public places like cafes and restaurants.This is the reality for countless LGBTQIA+ individuals. The need for a safe space for this community is not just a desire but a necessity—a space where one can be themselves. This struggle for safety and acceptance can be traced to crucial historical moments, such as the Stonewall Riots of 1969 in New York City.The Stonewall Inn was more than a bar; it was a refuge for the queer community. When police raided the bar, the community fought back. This series of violent confrontations, which began in the early hours of June 28, 1969, between police and gay rights activists, marked the beginning of the modern LGBTQIA+ rights movement. The spirit of Stonewall, the fight for dignity and the right to exist openly lives on in places like Inclusive Galaxy Restaurant in Kathmandu. Inclusive Galaxy beyond a restaurant is an ‘oasis’ for the queer community and beyond.Founded by Bishwaraj Adhikari, Mr Gay Handsome Nepal 2013, a human rights defender, the restaurant proves the power of safe spaces. It’s a place where the community can unite, free from the prejudice and hostility that often permeate their everyday lives.After years of working in the human rights sector, Adhikari and his partner developed the idea for Inclusive Galaxy. What began as a small cafe gradually evolved into a full-fledged restaurant, driven by the growing demand and support from the community.“In developed countries with strong LGBTQIA+ movements, you can find community areas like gay villages. These are created as safe spaces for people whose families and communities have excluded them. They also support new business ideas and pink tourism. I hope to see pink tourism develop in Nepal someday,” says Adhikari. His vision for Inclusive Galaxy goes beyond just being a restaurant. He aims to promote financial independence and empowerment within the queer community.Since its inception in February 2019, Inclusive Galaxy has become a key spot for many in Lazimpat, a relatively queer-friendly area in Kathmandu. The location is essential because the first LGBTQIA+ movement in Nepal started in 2001 through the Blue Diamond Society.Inclusive Galaxy, true to its name, welcomes everyone—queer and non-queer alike—to share a comfortable space. His vision was clear: to create a space where people of all genders and sexual identities could come together without fear of exclusion.“I didn’t want to make it exclusively for queer people because that would be excluding ourselves from society. Different groups need to live together and understand each other,” Adhikari explains.In the early days, the cafe attracted both queer and non-queer customers. However, when some of the residents learned about Adhikari’s identity and the nature of the clientele, there was a brief period of hesitation. “At first, I didn’t understand what was happening, but then I realised my identity was an issue for a few people. I believe people should be judged by others by their character, not by their gender or sexuality. Over time, as residents saw that we operated like any other cafe, they became more comfortable,” Adhikari reflects.Adhikari started Inclusive Galaxy to give queer individuals a place to be proud of themselves, counteracting the self-doubt and insecurity that hiding one’s identity can cause. This turned the cafe very quickly into a community hub. The journey was not without challenges, though. It was difficult to hire staff and cooks from the LGBTQIA+ community, and soon after the restaurant opened, the COVID pandemic made things even harder.Despite these difficulties, the doors of Inclusive Galaxy remained open. During the pandemic, many queer individuals, who were abandoned by their families or afraid to return home, found comfort at Inclusive Galaxy.Since many couldn’t afford to pay for meals, the restaurant provided free food from its resources. As the number of people needing meals grew to 20-30 daily, Adhikari started raising funds within the community.“During my time as an activist, many people came here not only for food but also to see an organisation where the queer community supports one another,” Adhikari says.“The time during COVID was difficult, but it brought me closer to the community.”Four years after its inception, the restaurant has garnered a loyal following. Sarosy Neupane, Miss Pink Nepal 2024 first runner-up, describes Inclusive Galaxy as her second home. She moved to Kathmandu to study in 2022. Being distant from her family, she started visiting Galaxy for meals that reminded her of home-cooked food. Over time, she grew attached to the café because of its welcoming atmosphere.“It’s heartwarming to see people from our community and different walks of life here. The founders even invite us to festivals like ‘Dahi Chiura Khane din,’” she shares.Neupane visits the cafe regularly and sometimes stays until 3 am, engrossed in conversations. “I hope more spaces like this can open in the future. If, unfortunately, this place were to close someday, I don’t think we’d have any other place to turn to,” she adds.Muna Chhetri, a trans woman who has been a loyal customer for three years, shares, “This is my safe space where I can truly be myself. I always feel judged in other restaurants, but that fear doesn’t exist here. It’s where even those who aren’t accepted at home can feel accepted.”Sahara Khadka Chhetri, owner of Pink Tiffany, Kathmandu’s first openly LGBTIQIA+ friendly restaurant and bar, frequently visits after managing the bar, appreciating the convenience of not cooking at home.She notes very few places like this cater to our community, and some even had to close during COVID. “As an entrepreneur, I know that sustaining these spaces is a challenge. But as more spaces like these open, they will make the way for a more inclusive and compassionate society.”The welcoming atmosphere at Inclusive Galaxy has also had a surprising effect on non-queer patrons. Samriddha Jung Rana, a twenty-year-old neighbour who identifies as straight, often visits the café and appreciates the importance of such spaces.“Previously, I didn’t know much about the queer community and didn’t care much. But now, coming into this café, I’ve been interested in their rights and issues. I’ve realised that we’re not so different after all. We are all human,” he remarks.The ventures like Inclusive Galaxy and Pink Tiffany have inspired hope for collaborative businesses between queer and non-queer groups. The recent initiative by the Nepal Tourism Board promoting Pink Tourism in April 2024 is a positive step. Still, Adhikari believes that more support is needed from the government and the private sector.Despite the progress, challenges remain. However, Adhikari remains optimistic about the future. He is working on plans to develop the restaurant into a homestay program in the future.“Like how different planets, asteroids, and stars make up a beautiful galaxy, people from all walks of life and identities make a beautiful society. I am happy that we are assimilating together in this space. We are not so different; we are all different and similar simultaneously,” he says. \nAditya Mishra is a Nepali chef and entrepreneur based in New York. Passionate about elevating Nepali cuisine globally, Mishra sharpened his culinary skills while staging at various Michelin-starred restaurants in the city during his time at culinary school. A recipient of the James Beard Foundation National Scholars Scholarship in 2023, Mishra’s early experiences inspired him to establish his own supper club, ‘The Sewing Tin’, alongside co-founder Akhil Upad.In an interview with Post’s Aarati Ray, Mishra discusses his restaurant in New York, serving Nepali cuisines there and the recipe for his signature dish.How did your cooking journey start in New York?At 14, I told my parents I wanted to be a chef, but they preferred I pursue a stable career like engineering, as many Nepali families do. So, I left for Louisiana in 2019 to study engineering.But, cooking never left my heart so, after a year, I left engineering college and moved to New York City. It’s been three and a half years and my parents only learned about it later. When my mom visited me in NYC and saw my dedication to cooking, she saw my passion and supported my decision.What sparked your interest in cooking from a young age?As a child, I was drawn to cooking shows on TLC. The glamour of cooking, eating, travelling and the prosperity of famous chefs was fascinating.Around age 16, I discovered Chef Anthony Bourdain’s groundbreaking book, ‘Kitchen Confidential’, which shed light on the reality of the culinary industry. I learned how he became a cultural icon in NYC, reshaping perceptions of chefs.I was also fascinated by chefs like Marco Pierre White, who was a mentor to Gordon Ramsay. Their stories of achieving fame while maintaining discipline intrigued me. But, as I grew older and entered the culinary world, I realised it was far from glamorous—it involved dedication and I am glad I persevered.How did the idea for The Sewing Tin originate?The concept of ‘The Sewing Tin’ came when I realised the stark contrast between the romanticised view of kitchen work and its harsh reality. Witnessing the struggles of many kitchen staff—economic hardships, immigration challenges and language barriers—I had to rediscover my love for cooking.During my internship at ‘Junoon’ restaurant, I met my co-founder, Akhil Upad, who shared my culinary enthusiasm despite his preparations for medical college. Together, we wanted to create a dining experience that was more personal and communal, offering fine dining with a sense of community.We wanted our food to tell stories, so we named our restaurant ‘The Sewing Tin’ inspired by the immigrant experience in NYC. When immigrants opened cookie boxes as kids, they often found sewing supplies instead of food.‘The Sewing Tin’ is like opening a cookie box and finding sewing supplies—something uniquely desi, or South Asian. How do you promote Nepali cuisine in New York City through The Sewing Tin?My partner is from Atlanta with Indian roots, while I come from Nepal, so our menu celebrates and reflects both cultures and heritage.We represent our respective cultures authentically. For example, we have a dish inspired by Newari cuisine called kachaila, similar to French Tartar. We present it as Tartar to make it accessible to our customers but infuse it with Nepali flavours, telling stories about its origins and giving diners a taste of my homeland.What do you think of the prospects of Nepali cuisine abroad?I’m on a mission to share Nepali food worldwide. I have served up dishes like chatamari and lamb sekuwa in my restaurant. But I’m still learning and want to explore more of Nepal’s cuisines. My big dream? To make Nepali cuisine reach more places because it’s got something special that can wow taste buds everywhere.How do you see the changes in restaurants in Nepal?The restaurant industry has deep roots in community and bringing people together, dating back centuries. While this core idea remains, modern restaurants have evolved, making changes to adapt to the times.Yet, in Nepal, despite the growing number of restaurants, many lack uniqueness and storytelling, focusing more on making money than fostering a sense of community.I’ve noticed a troubling trend of rising prices, especially for beloved dishes like momos, which makes people question if they're getting value for their money. It seems like profits are taking precedence over creating genuine, authentic culinary experiences.The industry is starting to lose the creativity and passion that once made it special. It might be time for chefs to shake things up, challenge the norm and bring fresh ideas to the table, revitalising the culinary scene with renewed energy and creativity.What challenges have you faced in New York as an outsider?Living in a bustling city like New York as an outsider has its challenges. But, this city is also full of opportunities for those who are passionate. If you stay true to your culture and want to share your story, opportunities are waiting for you.Even though it can be daunting because of the tough competition, the city appreciates determination and expertise. When I started my journey here, all I wanted to do was cook, eat and share the story of Nepal and its diverse cultures. Instead of focusing on the difficulties, I embraced the chance to follow my passion.What do you think about the criticism of blending Nepali food with modern culinary styles?Chefs care about their food—it’s like they’re sharing a story. They’ve put in a lot of effort to become skilled, so let them be creative. It’s okay to give helpful advice but don’t be mean just to criticise. Chefs shouldn’t also just copy what’s popular, they should cook what they truly love. That’s what makes food special and meaningful.Mishra’s signature dish:Confit Duck Chatamari A traditional Nepali delicacy with French influence.Ingredients:Duck (Legs and breast)Rice (soaked overnight)MayonnaiseWhole spices (cloves, cinnamon, cardamom, bay leaf)Red onionGarlicGingerMula ko achar (Fermented radish)ScallionsLemon juiceNepali pepperVinegarSaltSugarProcedure:For the Duck:Season duck with salt and pepper.Cook in a covered pan with whole spices, garlic, and ginger at low heat for 2 hours on a stove (270 degrees in the oven)Increase heat to crisp up the skin (approximately 15 minutes).Shred the duck meat.Confit Garlic Aioli:Mash cooked garlic and ginger and mix with mayonnaise, lemon juice, Nepali pepper and fermented radishes.Pickled Onions:Slice onions and cook in a mixture of vinegar, water, salt, sugar, and whole spices until softened (about 10 minutes).For the chatamari:Blend soaked rice to make a batter, let it ferment for 6 hours, and adjust consistency with water.Assembling:Cook chatamari batter in duck fat for 4 minutes.Top with shredded duck, aioli, pickled onions and scallions.Serve \nCeleus Baral exudes a serene aura when you meet her, and when she tells you she bakes, it makes sense. Even during a brief encounter, you can tell she has the patience needed to be a baker.“You can eyeball cooking, but baking is chemistry. You have to be meticulous. You cannot rush it, or it does not turn out as expected,” says the 21-year-old environment science student. She also runs the online baking shop Bakeleus. Recently, she has also started selling her baked goods beyond her online shop, with her first stall appearing at The Yellow House’s Night Market. Bakeleus’s menu lists a variety of offerings, including jams, granola, tarts, cakes, cookies, cupcakes and brownies. Baral began baking in 2020, during the lockdown, and launched her online shop last year.She grows much of the produce she incorporates into her baking, and believes we should all understand the origins of our food. “This connection fosters gratitude and a deeper appreciation for nature,” she says. Her background in environmental science, coupled with her affinity for the natural world, imbues her creations with a unique artistic sensibility. Each item she bakes is a testament to her creativity and experimentation, as she believes consistent practice is the key to mastery.Despite the demands of being a full-time student, Baral strives to accommodate orders, typically requiring a minimum of 72 hours' notice for delivery. She is a passionate and discerning individual, evident in the love she infuses into her baking. Additionally, Baral advocates for a zero-waste policy at home, ensuring that every scrap of food and all household items are recycled.Three easy to bake recipes you can try at homeMini carrot cakes Ingredients:38 g milk or yoghurt35 g all-purpose flour1/4 tea spoon ground cinnamon1/8 tea spoon ground gingerA pinch of cardamom1 tea spoon baking powder½ tea spoon fine sea salt2 large eggs, at room temperature27 g granulated sugar13 g brown sugar (or 39 g of regular granulated sugar)1 tea spoon vanilla extract27 g extra virgin olive oil33 g carrots, peeled and shreddedChopped walnutsCandied lemon or orange slices (optional for garnish)Cream cheese frosting56.5 g unsalted butter, softened113.5 g cream cheese, softened1/2 teaspoon vanilla extractA pinch of salt250 g powdered sugarDirections:For the cake:Preheat the oven to 195°C.

They then began marching towards the presidential office.The leader of Yoon’s ruling People Power Party called for Defence Minister Kim Yong-hyun to be fired and the entire cabinet to resign. Kim has offered to resign, the defence ministry said.Yoon told the nation in a television speech late on Tuesday that martial law was needed to defend the country from pro-North Korean anti-state forces and protect the free constitutional order, although he cited no specific threats.Troops tried to seize control of the parliament building but stood back when parliamentary aides sprayed them with fire extinguishers, while protesters scuffled with police outside.Within hours of the declaration, South Korea’s parliament, with 190 of its 300 members present, unanimously passed a motion for martial law to be lifted, with 18 members of Yoon’s party present.The president then rescinded the declaration of martial law, around six hours after its proclamation.Protesters outside the National Assembly shouted and clapped. “We won!” they chanted, and one demonstrator banged on a drum.“There are opinions that it was too much to go to emergency martial law, and that we did not follow the procedures for emergency martial law, but it was done strictly within the constitutional framework,” a South Korean presidential official told Reuters by telephone.There has been no reaction yet from North Korea to the drama in the South.Yoon was embraced by leaders in the West as a partner in the US-led effort to unify democracies against growing authoritarianism in China, Russia and elsewhere.But he caused unease among South Koreans by branding his critics as “communist totalitarian and anti-state forces” as his approval ratings slipped. In November, he denied wrongdoing in response to influence-peddling allegations against him and his wife and he has taken a hard line against labour unions.Markets VolatileSeoul appeared largely normal on Wednesday, with the usual rush hour traffic in trains and on the streets.But Hyundai Motor’s (005380.KS)labour union announced plans to stage strikes on Thursday and Friday and some major employers, including Naver Corp (035420.KS), opens new tab and LG Electronics Inc (066570.KS), advised employees to work from home.South Korean stocks (.KS11), opens new tab fell about 1.3 percent while the won was stable but close to a two-year low with dealers reporting suspected intervention by South Korean authorities.Finance Minister Choi Sang-mok and Bank of Korea Governor Rhee Chang-yong held emergency meetings overnight and the finance ministry promised to prop up markets if needed.“We will inject unlimited liquidity into stocks, bonds, short-term money market as well as forex market for the time being until they are fully normalised,” a government statement said.Sales of canned goods, instant noodles and bottled water had soared overnight, said a major South Korean convenience store chain, which sought anonymity.“I’m deeply disturbed by this kind of situation, and I’m very concerned about the future of the country,” 39-year-old Seoul resident Kim Byeong-in told Reuters.The National Assembly can impeach the president if more than two-thirds of lawmakers vote in favour. A trial by the constitutional court follows, which can confirm the motion with a vote by six of the nine justices.Yoon’s party has 108 seats in the 300-member legislature.‘Dodged a Bullet’If Yoon resigned or was removed from office, Prime Minister Han Duck-soo would fill in as leader until a new election was held within 60 days.“South Korea as a nation dodged a bullet, but President Yoon may have shot himself in the foot,” Danny Russel, vice president of the Asia Society Policy Institute think tank in the United States, said of the first martial law declaration in South Korea since 1980.US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said he welcomed Yoon's decision to rescind the martial law declaration.“We continue to expect political disagreements to be resolved peacefully and in accordance with the rule of law,” Blinken said in a statement.South Korea hosts about 28,500 American troops as a legacy of the 1950-1953 Korean War.Planned defence talks and a joint military exercise between the two allies were postponed amid the broader diplomatic fallout from the overnight turmoil.South Korea’s political situation is an “internal matter” for the country, China’s Foreign Minister Wang Yi told reporters.Russia said it was following the “tragic” events in South Korea with concern.Yoon, a career prosecutor, squeezed out a victory in the tightest presidential election in South Korean history in 2022, riding a wave of discontent over economic policy, scandals and gender wars.But he has been unpopular, with his support ratings hovering at around 20 percent for months and the opposition captured nearly two-thirds of seats in parliament in an election in April.Martial law has been declared more than a dozen times since South Korea was established as a republic in 1948. In 1980, a group of military officers forced then-President Choi Kyu-hah to proclaim martial law to crush calls for the restoration of democratic government. \nChaaaiiittt…The spontaneous eruption of the sound of victory thundered through the neighbourhood of Nhyokha in the Kathmandu core. The line of a kite cut another. Looking out the window of her house, Sajani Shrestha saw children running full speed, shouting and fighting as they vied to catch the falling kite and thread. And craning her neck up to the sky, she could not count but only be mesmerised by the innumerable kites strewn across the skies of Nhyokha, Bangemudha, Indrachowk. “There would be so many kites that they entirely covered the blue of the sky, making beautiful patterns of different colours,” says the 51-year-old. “And you cannot imagine the number of times the call of chait rang in the air.”Clear blue sky and gentle westerlies, the season of kites has arrived in the Kathmandu Valley. While kites soared Kathmandu's sky mainly during Dashain, the kite season officially started in Nag Panchami (August) and ended on the Haribodhini Ekadashi (November). And from royalities to commoners, young and old all flew kites from rooftops and open grounds. Even those who did not, like Sajani, revelled in the live spectacle in the sky as kites soared and fought. With Bhimsen Thapa’s help, King Girvanyuddha flies kites The earliest written account of kite flying is believed to date to 200 BC in China. In Kathmandu, this tradition has religious and socio-cultural and environmental significance, says Tina Manandhar, lecturer of Nepalese History, Culture and Archaeology at Tribhuvan University. According to her, it is believed that kites in Kathmandu skies carry a message to the god of rain Indra that the valley's farmers have had enough rain for their crops. That is why Kathmandu farmers scolded anyone flying kites before plantation season.In an article ‘Changako Utpati Ra Bikas’ published in Gorkhapatra in 1995, historian Rajesh Gautam points to the lack of written documents indicating the exact time when kite culture was introduced in Nepal. Exploring different opinions on kite's introduction to Nepal, he writes that “some have opined the possibility that the skill and tradition of kite flying might have entered Nepal through India.” Yet some others, he writes, state that kites “came to Nepal from Japan during the time of [Rana PM] Dev Shumsher.”He concludes that most likely this tradition was introduced by Malla-era Newar traders: “But since Nepal’s relationship with Tibet and China is very old and direct, kites might have entered Nepal through the Newar traders who were engaged in the trade. One can estimate that the kite was introduced to Nepal during the (mediaeval) Malla regime.”In Social History of Nepal, TR Vaidya, Tri Ratna Manandhar and Shankar Lal Joshi write that there exists documented evidence of the kite flying from the early 19th century. The authors state that Sundarananda, a contemporary poet, has mentioned that the young king Girvanyuddha Bikram Shah (r.1799-1816), with the help of Prime Minister Bhimsen Thapa, flew kites from the towering temple of Taleju Bhawani, Hanumandhoka. And when the king's kite cut the kites of the youngsters, they were located and rewarded with money.In Tyas Bakhatko Nepal, Sardar Bhim Bahadur Pandey states that “During the month of Kartik [October-November] young and old all flew kites,” suggesting that kite culture was ubiquitous in Kathmandu by the early twentieth century.Anticipations and preparationsKite flying in Nepal requires a kite, a lattai (a wooden spool), thread and majha (homemade adhesive prepared by boiling snail slime, rice or sago, and powdered glass from burnt electric bulbs and coated on the line to sharpen it for kite fighting).77-year-old Nirmal Man Tuladhar, an avid kite flyer and retired professor of Linguistics at the Tribhuvan University, explains how Nepali tradition of kite flying was both expensive and needing advance preparation.“In our times, it wasn’t easy to fly kites,” he says. “We had to prepare majha …And as Nepali kites are fighter kites, we mainly fought with other kites [which meant we spent a lot of threads].”This preparation needed first and foremost of passing a hurdle: securing finances and materials to fly kites. While lattai was a one-time investment that could be saved for years, kites and threads had to be replenished every time a kite was cut.“Those were the times when parents wanted us to be more focused in our studies. They only gave money [to buy kites] after immense pestering,” says 80-year-old Dwarika Nath Dhungel, former Secretary of Nepal government, speaking of the 1950s and 1960s.Biodiversity specialist and botanist Tirtha Bahadur Shrestha, 86, was born in Mahabouddha and began flying kites from 1951-52. He saved what little money he got for afternoon snacks to buy Hattimar reel, a brand of line wound in a small lattai, which was strong and sharp and where majha stuck well.Raghuji Pant, a member of parliament, also recalls the difficulty in securing money to sustain his kite flying in and around Kathmandu core in the 1960s and early 1970s. “Four to five of my kites were cut in a day,” writes the 67-year-old in his 2019 article “Changa Jastai Udi Hidne Man” published in Himalkhabar. “[This caused] the line in the spool to shorten. From Bhadra [August-September] to one to one and a half months after Dashain I spent flying kites. So, it was difficult for me to have enough kites even after getting money from grandfather, grandmother, mother and everyone.”Kites and thread secured, now began the crucial work of preparing and applying majha whose strength determined how well it cut other kites. Govinda Tandon, 70, a historian and heritage expert, who grew up in Battisputali, was also an ardent kite flyer.“Materials for making majha were prepared right from the morning on a holiday,\" he writes in his article “Dashainko Butte Changa” published in Gorkhapatra. “Because this work couldn’t be accomplished without a collaboration of 3-4 friends, a holiday was set aside for this. Moreover, a sunny day was considered appropriate. If the majha didn’t dry, the thread could turn moist, and so if it felt like the day wouldn’t be sunny, the entire plan…was aborted.”Kite makers, kite sellers and variety of kites One of the oldest shops in Kathmandu's memory, Shree Chitrakar Kite Center in Tyauda, Asan is bustling with customers during Dashain. “When my grandmother got married and came to this house at age 12 [in early 1940s], this shop was already here,” says its fourth generation owner 47-year-old Dinoj Chitrakar. “So the shop must be around a hundred years old.”Another shop that stands out in Kathmandu's memory is Manandhar Kite Center in Kalimati, established in 1949, and currently run by brothers Mohan Man and Sundar Man Manandhar.In his book Antar Taranga, artist and writer Manuj Babu Mishra recalls “a kite shop near the old halwai shop of Chabahil” in the 1940s. Dhungel and his 1960 batchmates of Juddhodaya Public School recall the kite shops from the 1950s and 1960s – Bekhacha’s Shop at Netapacho, Bhaicha’s Shop at Nhyokha, Lata Manandhar’s Shop at Maru, Kanchha Buddha Bajracharya Shop at Tyauda.Besides the shops, there were makers and sellers of kites cloistered in different localities of Kathmandu Valley.In Kwalkhu, Patan was a Joshi who made Nepali paper kites.“One day I accompanied my uncle to buy kites,\" writes Dibya Giri, 69, in his 2023 article “Changa” in Sahitya Post. “I was amazed to see the huge stacks of kites there. We used to call it the house of the kite maker.”In Nhyokha, Purna Bahadur Shrestha began making kites as a teenager and started his own kite business in the 1950s, according to his daughter Sajani.These kites, made out of Nepali paper, often had different paintings. Mishra recalls painting kites for the kite shop in Chabahil.“I went to that kite shop and with the freely available colours and Nepali papers, I spent my day painting faces, birds, animals, masks, mountains, hills, whatever came to my mind,” he writes in the book. “Such kites apparently sold well!”Most septuagenarians and older generations like Tuladhar and Tirtha Bahadur recall flying kites made of Nepali paper when young. Tirtha Bahadur says that kites from Lucknow began coming to Kathmandu only after the late 1950s. But at least a section of Kathmandu was flying kites from Lucknow from the early twentieth century. Vaidya, Manandhar and Joshi write that the Ranas and Shahs imported kites from Lucknow and that from them, their favourite employees also got to fly some. These kites were large and, in Tyas Bakhatko Nepal, Pande writes that they were referred to as Lucknowia kites.Known for their characteristic hissing sound they made while flying, light body, swift movement and ability to take sharp turns, Lucknow kites were preferred by kite fighters.“Lucknow kites were lighter and could be manoeuvred well,” says Tuladhar. “Kites of Nepali paper were stable but difficult to manoeuvre. They were also expensive. So only some fighters flew Nepali paper kites.”The kites had different names depending upon their designs and colours – Ambe (a heart in the centre), Dibdibe (chequered), Pakhete (a different coloured paper on one edge), Sete (white-coloured), Nilchi (blue-coloured), Rate (red-coloured) and so on.The kite fighters preferred the strong and sharp Hattimar reel that came on a small lattai. The Belchamar reel was cheaper but weaker and prone to be cut by other threads. Kite fliers and kite watchers on rooftops and open groundsBibek Shrestha, 57, and his two brothers took stacks of kites and climbed their rooftops. The rooftops around theirs in the neighbourhood of Nhyokha – in fact in all core settlements of the Valley – were filled with kite fliers and spectators. Many risked precariously balancing on the sloped roofs.While Bibek and his brothers’ kites alighted to meet the sea of kites in the sky, their sister Sajani and other family members gathered around to revel in the live spectacle.Dhungel remembers the rooftops of Jhochhen and surroundings of the 1950s and 1960s swelled with kite fliers. Dhungel did try to fly kites. But he did not become a successful kite flyer. What he did become was, like Sajani and many Kathmandu residents, an admirer of kites soaring in the sky.“But more than engaging in my unsuccessful kite flying attempts, I enjoyed looking at the kites flying. There would be a big crowd of spectators. Females and other family members watched the kites fly as they ate meat and chiura. Some even drank and rejoiced as they flew kites.”When the age of cassette player and speakers dawned in the 1980s, songs blared from the speakers alongside kite flying. Chitrakar and Bibek invited their friends, put their favourite songs on speakers and spent entire afternoons flying kites, dancing, singing and eating.Away from the core cities, in the villages in the Valley, people flew kites in open fields. Like Dibya, who set his kite for flight from the banks of Godavari River in Tikathali. Chhauni was also a popular space for flying kites.Kathmandu’s joy in kite fightingBibek pulled his kite down and then manoeuvred it back up so his line touched his opponent's line from below and quickly reeled out his line. The resulting sharpness from the speed cut the opponent's line.Chaaaiiitttt………“The greatest fun comes from cutting another kite's string,” writes Tuladhar in his 1996 article “Cutting is the greatest fun” published in magazine Kite Lines. “With its coating of adhesive paste and ground glass, the string is as sharp and abrasive as sandpaper on your opponent's line.”Nepali kite, Tuladhar says, is made to fight other kites, and describes how a kite line cuts the other.“The technique is to touch your rival's string and immediately reel out line at high speed,” he writes. “The Nepalese style of kite flying is aggressive, and though the kites look simple, they are strategically designed for bringing down other kites.”At any given time, like Bibek’s kite above Nhyokha sky, skies above the Valley were filled with raging kites, swinging, coming down and going up as the fighters reeled in and out their lattais in ferocious attempts to bring down other kites.Meanwhile spectators cheered. “Even passersby stopped to look at the kites,” recalls Tina.The moment of a kite cutting was accompanied by the sound of chait, and children ran in the direction of the falling kite to grab it and the thread in what was termed as, Dibya says, changa lutne/dhago lutne.Dhungel always joined in to shout the chait resounding through the locality of Jhochhen and almost automatically his feet sped towards the severed kites' direction.“‘Oii leave that thread,’ the kite owner would scold me. ‘Why do you pull my thread, leave it right now.’ But I’d continue pulling the threads as the owner continued shouting. Other times I caught the kites that had failed to fly and dropped on the ground.”The fallen kites got stuck in the buildings, trees or poles, or glided down in the open grounds or paddy fields. Falling kites from the Kathmandu core settled down in Tundikhel covering it. Oftentimes kites fell on the fields to rest upon the lush paddy nearing its harvest.“Children ran straight into the fields to catch the kite,” says Dibya. \"They destroyed the crops by stepping on them. Some farmers chased them, scolding along as they did so and if they caught anyone, they slapped them.”Love and restrictions on kiteAmidst the raging kite fights high up in the sky, there were apparently also some quieter kites lingering much lower among the buildings or tree lines, for their goals lay in not ruthlessly cutting the threads of other kites but piercing softly through the hearts of their owners' love interests. During the Rana regime, there were designated public spaces to fly kites, writes Gautam in his article. Referring to oral accounts, he writes that the Ranas were particularly careful to avoid kite flyers around their durbars. This is because love-stricken men tied letters to kites and flew them into the durbars to their love interests among the nanis.He writes that the kites could be flown mainly on the grounds of Chhauni. Anyone flying kites in any other place and around Rana durbars were arrested.Pant also recalls love-stricken boys from his time. “Just as kites came in different colours and patterns, so did kite flyers,” he writes in the article. “Some wrote love letters using a few words in “symbolic language” on a plain kite and attempted to land it on the rooftop of the girl they liked. Some simply landed their kites on any rooftop if a girl appeared there and waited for reaction.”King Tribhuvan among kite fliersPande writes in his book: “Once or twice during kite season every year, King Tribhuvan went to Chhauni to fly kites. Legend has it that if the line of the king’s kite was cut, it flew to Lhasa. But since anyone who caught that kite received five rupees, everyone attempted to catch that kite.”In 2021 news report ‘Bhawanle Chhekidiyo Changa Udaune Aakash’ by Shivahari Ghimire published in Nayapatrika, cultural expert the late Satyamohan Joshi also recounts that “During Dashain, Tribhuvan came to the ground below Swayambhu to fly kites. […] He did not use the same thread to fly kites twice.”In the same article, Joshi says that the King also went to Budhanilakantha to fly kites and participate in kite flying competitions.End of season, end of cultureMohan Krishna Shrestha, 86, was born in Budhanilakantha. Every year, on the day of Haribodhini Ekadashi, he saw the annual fair at the Budhanilakantha Temple. He also witnessed kite fliers gathered in the open fields around the Temple.“Oh, it’d be a lot of people,” says Shrestha. “They came from all around Bhaktapur, Kathmandu and Lalitpur.”They flew kites on Ekadashi, Dwadashi and some even until Purnima.“They took all the remaining threads and kites that had survived Dashain and flew the last kites of the season,” says Tuladhar. “I remember my uncles, relatives and neighbours going to Budhanilakantha with their kites.”Joshi recalls in the 2021 article that King Tribhuvan also went to Budhanilakantha with his sons Mahendra, Himalaya and Basundhara. He greatly supported and also participated in the competitions there organised by the commoners. If he liked he gave prize money to the winners.This annual event lost its glory days after the decline in the open fields as buildings began to rise with the establishment of Budhanilkantha School in 1972, Mohan says.“The event survived in some form until the 1990s,” he says.But what happened after that?The end-of-the-season event in the 1990s was also an indication of the end of the age-old kite tradition.“If I go to my ancestral place in Asan to fly kites, it’s not possible for me to do that today because there are buildings everywhere,” says Tuladhar. “Cityscapes and urbanisation have created the obstacle for flying kites.”Dibya does feel like flying kites sometimes.“No space to fly kites today,” he says. “In the old times, there were river banks and open fields. Even if you fly kites, it gets stuck in somebody's rooftop or water tank or somewhere.”Yesteryear’s kite enthusiasts believe that increasing means of entertainment was another reason for the decline of kite culture.“When television came, kite flying started to slowly decrease,” says Bibek. “And then mobile phones robbed kite flying even more.”And so, when his sister Sajani cranes her neck up in the sky today, she rarely sees a kite.“Those days we heard one chait after another,” she says. “These days you won’t hear a single chait.” \nIn 2008 Matina Shakya was only three years old when she was appointed as the Kumari of Kathmandu. She was succeeded by Trishna Shakya as the new Kumari in 2017.Kumaris are revered as goddesses of beauty and strength in certain Hindu and Buddhist traditions. Worshipping young girls as Kumaris is a 2,000-year-old practice in Nepal. Since the 13th century, when the Malla kings ruled, the Newars of the Kathmandu Valley have been worshipping Kumari, a girl from the Shakya/Bajracharya community chosen to embody the divine energy of goddess Taleju Bhawani. The reign of a Kumari ends when she starts menstruating. So long as she is serving as the Kumari, she is believed to be the nation’s divine protector, safeguarding it from evil. Matina, 18, is now in her first year of college, studying for a bachelor’s degree in management. Her father, Pratapman Shakya, when asked about having a daughter who is the only living the goddess in the world said, “Not having your own daughter live in the same house as you seemed a little unfair, but we feel very proud to call ourselves the parents of the royal Kumari who is revered by people all over the world.”On March 9, 2023, he, along with Matina, were getting ready for a special function held to honour all former Kumaris from across Nepal. “There are often events to honour Matina as she was the royal Kumari, but this one was dedicated to all former Kumaris from different areas. There are 129 living Kumaris in all,” he added. Besides Kathmandu, Kumari tradition is followed in Bhaktapur, Lalitpur, and Kirtipur, among other cities.According to him, this was the first time an event like this was organised and the Deputy Mayor of Kathmandu, Sunita Dangol, was also in attendance.Throughout the year, many people line up outside the ‘Kumari Ghar’ to get a chance to visit the Kumari and get her blessings. Many foreigners stand out in the yard to catch a glimpse of her. Nepali people believe that if a Kumari smiles at you, it is a bad omen.Everyday, a tutor visits the Kumari to help her continue with her education as she is not allowed to step outside the Kumari Ghar. She takes her exams and does her homework from the Kumari Ghar itself. She also has the freedom to play inside the Kumari Ghar. Many former kumaris have pursued careers in their fields of interest or studied after their term ends, and they continue to be treated with the same respect. The tradition of Kumari has evolved over time. In the past Kumaris did not enjoy these freedoms.Because of various superstitious beliefs, Kumaris were not fully educated and were forbidden from getting married because of the belief that the groom would die soon if he married an ex-Kumari. They led secluded lives, were restricted from participating in normal childhood activities, and focused solely on their religious duties.However, now, these myths have been dispelled. Modern understanding has shifted to recognise that Kumaris, after stepping down from their divine role, have the freedom to marry and lead a normal life. The perception of Kumaris as isolated figures has evolved, with a focus on providing them with a more balanced upbringing. There have been initiatives to integrate Kumaris into regular social and educational settings, allowing them to have a more holistic and fulfilling childhood experience. “Matina was already familiar with the students from the school that she attended after her term as Kumari ended,” said Shakya. “The kids visited the Kumari Ghar frequently so that she could have a smooth transition,” he added. According to Gautam Prasad Shakya, who has been living as a caretaker in the Kumari Ghar, the changes made to the tradition are minor. “The traditions of Kumari have mostly stayed the same. All the rituals are still practised like in the old days,” he said.On 6 May 2005, Pun Devi Maharjan, a lawyer, filed a case in the Supreme Court claiming that the traditional practice of electing young girls as Kumaris, or “goddesses’, who are expected to follow certain social restrictions and appear at religious festivals, violated the rights of the child. Quoting Maharjan’s complaint, Puskar Mathema writes in Yuwamanch Monthly of October 2007, “If Kumari tradition is continued, it will undermine the fundamental rights as well the freedoms of children guaranteed by the constitution and child rights treaties. Apart from this, it will have a negative impact on their physical and mental development.”The case continued while Nepal overthrew the monarchy and declared itself a secular state in 2007. When the judgement was pronounced in 2008, the goddess was still in her role, now giving blessings to the country’s President. The court ordered that the Kumaris and ex-Kumaris receive better benefits and arrangements and ordered the government to improve their support and allowances.In April 2006, Prof Chunda Bajracharya filed a petition at the Supreme Court against Maharjan’s petition, who had argued against the Kumari tradition. Bajracharya contended that the tradition should be preserved as heritage due to its over 100 years of history.“People who don’t understand the culture shouldn’t comment on it,” she stated. Bajracharya also criticised the human right activists who contended that Kumaris were only allowed to wear the colour red. “People who say Kumaris are forced to wear red clothing all the time, are the same people who send their kids to schools in uniform,” she said.“After the 2008 court verdict, there have been a lot of improvements. Now, a teacher visits the Kumari Ghar daily to tutor the Kumari, who is expected to complete school assignments and sit periodic exams. All the former Kumaris now get benefits like scholarships and special pensions,” she added.Bajracharya is currently a professor of literature at the Tribhuvan University in Kathmandu.“The only significant change that the court verdict brought to the tradition was in terms of her education,” said Gautam Prasad Shakya, the caretaker. “Kumaris were tutored long before the case, but the case helped formalise this arrangement. After the court verdict, the time between 12 pm and 4 pm was designated as the Kumari’s tuition time,” he added.After the verdict, there was a concerted effort to provide Kumaris with access to quality education, enabling them to develop the skills and knowledge needed to lead fulfilling lives beyond their divine roles. There was also a shift towards ensuring that the Kumari's living quarters are comfortable, safe, and conducive to her overall well-being.Moreover, the selection process for the Kumari underwent reforms in the aftermath of the Pun Devi Maharjan case. There was a push for greater transparency, accountability, and inclusivity in the selection of the Kumari, with an emphasis on ensuring that the process was fair, respectful, and free from undue influence.Efforts were made to support their transition into adulthood, including providing them with comprehensive resources for education, vocation, and social integration. This shift aimed to address the challenges faced by former Kumaris and empower them to lead independent and fulfilling lives after their divine service.“The Kumari tradition has evolved over time. During the tenure of my daughter, we saw a lot of improvements. Even after her time as Kumari, Matina continued to get a lot of government support,” said Shakya, former Kumari Matina’s father.“Some people argue that child rights are being violated, but all of her rights are being upheld inside the Kumari Ghar. This is a unique and respected aspect of Nepali culture, and I don’t believe it violates any of my child’s rights.”While the Kumari tradition continues, its practices have evolved. “She enjoys this normal life and it didn’t take her long to adjust as well,” says Matina’s father, on her transition from the revered Kumari to the ordinary Matina. \nWhat animals did Juddha Shumsher have in his zoo?“We only have records of animals from the mid-1960s,” says Ganesh Koirala, who has been employed at the Central Zoo for the past 36 years and currently serves as its information officer and programme officer. “That too I hand-copied from an old torn-down file that I came across.”Today, the Central Zoo, which sprawls across six hectares in Jawalakhel, Lalitpur, houses as many as 1,298 wild animals of different species of mammals, reptiles, fishes and birds from Nepal and around the world—from tiger, rhinoceros, hippopotamus and red panda to its recent attraction: a pair of chimpanzees.After enduring decades of neglect under various government bodies, with its animals and infrastructure scraping along in a deplorable state, the zoo received a new lease of life with improved infrastructure and animal care in 1995, when it came under the management of the King Mahendra Trust for Nature Conservation (KMTNC), now known as the National Trust for Nature Conservation, in 1995.Today, the Central Zoo is an entertainment venue, one of the most happening places in the Kathmandu valley. Flocked by thousands of daily visitors, the zoo now also hosts rescued animals and those in need of rehabilitation. It is also a site for conservation education.But when Juddha Shumsher Rana (prime minister from 1932–1945) built the Jawalakhel Zoological Garden on the premises of his Jawalakhel Durbar (where Nepal Administrative Staff College stands today) in 1932, he did so purely for private interests—as a space of entertainment and amusement for him and his family.Built in the semi-wilderness of Jawalakhel around a historical pond dating to the 17th century during the reign of King Siddhi Narsingh Malla, the zoo also became the space he could use to show his respect for two women he revered, his mother and sister-in-law, and indulge in one of his favourite pastimes—gambling.Today, the Central Zoo, nestled in the heart of Jawalakhel's sprawling crowd, does not go unnoticed, and its story is well told. But what passions drove Juddha to build the zoo? What was its original layout? What animals did it have in the beginning? And how did Juddha spend time there?“I remember once seeing a small board that read ‘Jawalakhel Zoological Garden’,” Koirala says. “I don’t know whether it was from Juddha’s time or was made in the later years. It must surely be that Juddha built the zoo out of influence from the British given how this term was used by them.”Koirala adds, “There is a former employee, now an elderly gentleman who worked in the zoo in the 1960s. He surely has some stories from Juddha’s time.”Birds, beasts and palacesTo trace the birth of Jawalakhel Zoological Garden, one has to look at the history of Nepal’s rulers owning birds and animals.Like rulers around the world, Nepal’s royalty kept wild and exotic birds and animals in captivity as a source of pleasure and mark of wealth and power. The book ‘Social History of Nepal’ by historians TR Vaidya, Tri Ratna Manandhar and Shankar Lal Joshi details how Mallas during the mediaeval Kathmandu Valley to Ranas and Shahs in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries owned rare, exotic creatures. In 1708, a rhinoceros in Kathmandu Valley broke the iron chain in which it was bound and killed its tamer. In 1714, Bhaktapur’s King Bhupatindra Malla gifted a camel and an elephant to Kantipur’s King Bhaskar Malla to build peace.Among Shahs, King Rana Bahadur Shah in particular was reputed for his collection of birds and animals. He also owned a zoo outside his palace in Basantapur Durbar Square, where the Nepal Bank Limited stands in New Road today. The zoo contained “tiger, bear, monkey, elephant, horse, deer… heron, peacock… pigeon, wild dogs, rabbits, rats, mongoose.”Jung Bahadur Rana’s zoo on the premises of his Thapathali Durbar hosted a variety of birds and animals collected during his hunting expeditions as well as those brought from abroad. Jung Bahadur himself used to “supervise and inspect it”. Juddha Shumsher likewise had his own collection of creatures which steadily expanded into a zoological garden. Seeking wilderness in his Jawalakhel DurbarJuddha’s biographer Ishwari Prasad writes in ‘The Life and Times of Maharaja Juddha Shumsher Jung Bahadur Rana’ that between 1933 and 1940, Juddha shot 433 tigers, 33 rhinoceros and 93 leopards. An insatiable big-game hunter, Juddha had a deep fondness for being in the wild and among wild animals, and from this came, according to oral history prevalent among members of Kathmandu’s Rana community including Juddha’s descendants, the desire to own a zoo.Built in 1752, Schönbrunn Zoo in Vienna, the world’s first modern zoo, was already over 100 years old when Juddha was born in 1875. London Zoo opened in 1828 and Alipore Zoological Garden (Kolkata Zoo) in 1875. Nawab Wajid Ali Shah Zoological Garden (Lucknow Zoo) was established in 1921. Juddha’s inspiration, his descendants say, was most likely reinforced by his tours to zoological gardens during his visits to England in 1908 and to different Indian cities.An article titled ‘Central zoo in state of neglect’ published in The Kathmandu Post in 1996 says that Juddha one day “received a pair of leopards as a gift”, cementing his desire to own a zoo. A report ‘Central Zoo Master Plan’ prepared by the KMTNC in 1996 says that Juddha decided to build a zoo in an epiphany when he saw that some animals “including deer, a few rhinos, and some tigers had been collected from the Tarai and kept in Kathmandu” could be put into one compound in the “lonely piece of land with a large 16th [sic] century Malla period Pokhari”.The pond lay still and serene surrounded by green wilderness ever since Patan’s King Siddhi Narsingh Malla built it in the 1600s. On the grounds surrounding this pond, the Newars from Na:Tole, Pulchowk and surroundings had their devisthans where, for centuries, they gathered to perform their religious ceremonies during Basanta Panchami and Bhoto Jatra even after this area fell within the Jawalakhel Durbar.For the palace, the ground served as its extended garden along with a horse and elephant stable. Subodh Rana, 69, grandson of Juddha Shumsher, recalled his father Kiran Shumsher telling him that Juddha and his family sometimes also used the scenic grounds for picnics. If there was any spot where Juddha wanted to build a menagerie, it would be around this Pokhari (pond). One day, he called his grandson General Maheshwar Shumsher Rana and deputed him to the task of doing just this.The zoo’s layout—except for the small plots of lands acquired later—that was in place when it came under KMTNC's management was, the present and retired zoo officials believe, mostly the same as it was built by Maheshwar and so offers a peek into how Juddha’s zoo must have been like. Pond in the middle of the ground surrounded by enclosures—the southern bank housing mainly larger animals, and cages for birds positioned on the northern banks.From pigeons to the king of the jungleWhat animals and birds did the enclosures at Juddha’s zoo house?“We cannot tell for sure,” Koirala says.Once it came under government ownership, the zoo was tossed from one institution to the other for lack of interest and knowledge on the right institution to manage it. Amid all this chaos, documents were possibly lost and the zoo has no concrete record about the animals that Juddha must have once taken amusement at, said Koirala.Mukti Narayan Shrestha, 82, a retired secretary of the Nepal government, joined the Central Zoo in 1970 as a veterinarian when many original structures of the zoo were still intact. Shrestha also worked with an elderly khardar who, he says, was employed in the zoo since the time of Juddha and was about to retire when he joined.“In those days where the purpose of menageries was exclusively for exhibition and pleasure with no regard for the welfare and recreation of animals and birds, the cages were tiny and iron-barred,” Shrestha says.Elephant, horses, deer, monkeys, tiger, rhinoceros, clouded leopard, red panda, bear, palm civet (nir biralo), four-horned antelope, Himalayan goral, pheasants, Himalayan monal—from the mythical and the majestic, the gentle and friendly to the fiery and ferocious, Juddha’s zoo boasted them all, Shrestha says.Shrestha’s account is not different from the anecdotes passed down to other retired and present zoo officials and the members of the Rana community, who also detail the rare and the exotic fauna, like the gharial crocodile and porcupine, even the jungle’s king—creatures, they say, that Juddha must have received from foreigners as gifts—appearing alongside domestic birds like pigeons.Tidbits of published information also confirm that the zoo had a good collection of exotic birds and animals from Nepal and abroad. One such suggestion comes from Kalyan Shumsher’s ‘Shree Teen Juddha Mahima’ published during Juddha’s reign in 1943.“One need not travel abroad to see the incredible birds and animals found in foreign countries,” he writes. “It will suffice to see [those creatures] right here in the zoo opened by His Holiness Shree 3 [Juddha] in Jawalakhel.”Among these incredible creatures, one reigned supreme—lion, the king of the jungle.For one, it would not have satiated Juddha to build a zoo and not have the jungle’s king exhibited in it. Juddha hence must have done everything possible to ensure one for the zoo. Infrastructure at the zoo suggests that the lion indeed lived at Juddha’s zoo or, in the least, during the Rana regime.“Where bear habitat lies today, there were two dome-shaped attached enclosures with a holding room, constructed in the classic architecture that many enclosures in the British zoos had in the past. They had brick walls and lime plaster,” Koirala says. “These were built to house a lion in one cage and a tiger in the other.”Near these enclosures stood another cage that remains intact today, with the head of a roaring lion carved out of the wall on the top of its iron bars. Zoo officials as well as members of the Rana community believe that Juddha had this exhibit built to specifically house a lion.Remarkably, these Juddha-era infrastructural spaces are corroborated by a rare piece of photographic evidence. A 1946 photo of the zoo shows a lion while a Kathmandu mother and her sons stand in front of its cage.Juddha’s place of piety and playThe zoo was not merely a space that Juddha sought out for amusement and retreat in the outpost of his palace; he also used this place to express his deepest affection.This affection spills right at the zoo’s entrance, in the form of the life-size statue of Karma Kumari Devi, wife of Juddha’s elder brother and Rana Prime Minister Dev Shumsher. Karma Kumari stands tall in her regal costume shaded by a wide canopy. Juddha revered Karma Kumari because it was she who raised him and looked after his mother Juhar Kumari Devi after the death of his father Dhir Shumsher. On another prominent part of the zoo on the south-east, Juhar Kumari’s enthroned statue overlooks the pond. Juddha had commissioned the London-based sculptor Domenico Antonio Tonelli to cast these statues.When Karma Kumari’s statue was unveiled is not clear, but Juhar Kumari’s statue was unveiled by Juddha amid a grand function in 1935 on Jawalakhel’s most auspicious day, Bhoto Jatra. It was attended by the British Resident Frederick Bailey.“On June 28, 1935, at Jawalakhel Durbar… the pond nearby looked very scenic,” says a Gorkhapatra news report titled ‘Statue installation’ dated July 5, 1935. “Because it was the day of Bhoto Jatra of Machhindranath… and moreover since an ideal woman’s statue was being unveiled, there was a crowd of lakhs of people.”Less than fifty metres from Karma Kumari’s statue stands a one-story building with a pagoda roof that today serves as the zoo’s meeting hall. Juddha, an avid gambler, found the scenic semi-wilderness covered in trees and filled with the sounds of wildlife to be a perfect place to relish the game. So he built a building with twelve doors on its four sides allowing him and his fellow gambling compatriots the freedom to enter through a particular door that they thought would bring luck. He called it his Juwa Ghar, the gambling house, and built it with the sole purpose of indulging in the game he loved. Roar of lion reverberates in KathmanduThe sounds of the animals and birds in the zoo rose up in the Jawalakhel sky. Every day, until much later in the 1970s, roar of the zoo’s lion (there were later other lions) diffused to far corners of the Valley, merging the zoo with the spirit of Kathmandu and informing the city folks of its presence.But was the zoo open to the public as well?“I think once it was built, the zoo was open for the public,” Subodh Rana said. “It is unlikely that Juddha Shumsher built such a large zoo and kept it only for his family.”For one, Kalyan Shumsher mentioning that one “need not travel abroad to see the incredible birds and animals found in foreign countries” suggests that the public had at least some access to the zoo. Of course, the Newar community from Na:Tole, Pulchowk and surrounding areas were permitted inside the zoo on the days of their guthi functions on Basanta Panchami and Bhoto Jatra.As the zoo was established at the back of the ground where Bhoto Jatra celebrations happen, it naturally filled with revellers on this day in addition to the guthi ritual observers as testified by the Gorkhapatra report. The photo of the mother and her sons also bear testimony that the zoo was not entirely closed to the public.What is widely believed, though, is that the zoo officially came under government ownership after Nepal became a democracy in 1951. And it would still be a few more years before it was open to the public in 1956.In 1945, Juddha gave up his power and eventually retired in Dehradun, India, where he died in 1952. With time, Jawalakhel Zoological Garden became the Central Zoo. It would take many avatars—a neglected site of crammed, unmaintained cages with sad eyes of emaciated creatures staring from behind the bars, a focal point of animal diplomacy, particularly during the period of monarchy, to, in its recent decades, a space of conservation and education.When all this was happening, the city sprawled around Jawalakhel, subduing the lion’s roar with its noise. More wildlife from around the country and the world came—creatures captured from the wild, those sold by circuses, those rescued from traffickers. Fate would bring these creatures to the care of generations of Kathmandu folks, intertwining each other’s joys and sorrows. After the tale of Juddha’s Jawalakhel Zoological Garden, there would be these stories to tell. Sitting around a table inside Juddha’s Juwa Ghar, Koirala and other zoo officials begin unfolding these stories before me. \nRecently, a 22-year-old man visited Sukraraj Tropical and Infectious Disease Hospital (STIDH) to get his sexually transmitted disease status checked after having unprotected sex. He was to leave abroad for higher education the following day. Likewise, several months ago, a young man expressed his distress over the intense pain following a penicillin injection administered against syphilis disease. When questioned about his marital status, he stated that he only had a girlfriend with whom he maintained a regular consensual sexual relationship. He further mentioned that the sexual interactions were generally unprotected. As per the hospital (STIDH) data, the majority of individuals receiving penicillin injections for syphilis are between 20 and 40 years old, with nearly two-thirds of that group being in the 20 to 30 age range. It’s a surprising but concerning public health concern in Nepal. Unprotected sexual contact not only carries the risk of syphilis but also increases the likelihood of other infectious diseases such as HIV, Mpox (known as “monkeypox”), HPV, gonorrhoea, herpes, chlamydia, trichomoniasis and hepatitis B. Since syphilis does not immediately show severe symptoms, many people do not get tested and thus remain unaware of their infection. There has been a notable rise in youths seeking foreign employment opportunities in recent years. This mandates medical examinations and blood tests, including for sexually transmitted infections/diseases. Following this, information about the spread of syphilis in Nepal has surfaced. People who engage in unprotected sexual activities, especially with more than one partner, have a higher likelihood of contracting syphilis. A bacterium, 'Treponema pallidum', is responsible for the infection. The transmission occurs through vaginal, oral, and anal intercourse as well as during pregnancy and through blood transfusions. Syphilis has four stages. On average, symptoms appear within three weeks of infection. This is referred to as the first stage. Sores may appear on the genitals, vagina, mouth/lips, or anus. As the sores are painless, many do not notice them or tend to overlook them. If treatment is provided around this time, the infection can be prevented from progressing to the second stage. Even without treatment, the sores typically heal within three to six weeks. However, the infection will progress to the second stage. Small rashes can be seen on various body parts (including the palms and soles) a few weeks after the first stage. Since these rashes are not clearly visible or do not cause pain or itching, people usually do not pay attention to them. However, symptoms such as fever, swollen lymph nodes, sore throat and fatigue can occur. The infection will enter the next stage, known as the 'latent stage' if left untreated. As per the hospital data, the majority of youths are commonly diagnosed and treated for syphilis during this stage. There are no symptoms in the latent stage; however, the infection can persist in the body for years if left untreated. The disease then progresses to the ‘tertiary stage’. This can occur 10-30 years after the initial infection. In this stage, syphilis can affect or damage vital organs such as the nervous system, eyes, heart and ears. Regrettably, information about complications or deaths due to the “tertiary stage” of syphilis is not well studied/known in Nepal to date. According to research published in the journal BMJ Open in 2024, 94.5 percent of sexually active students were found to have had risky sexual behaviour (RSB) in Kathmandu. Nearly one-third of the participants were found to be engaged with multiple partners. The participants ranged from 18 to 32 years, with a mean age of 21. The study only focused on undergraduate students residing in hostels in Kathmandu. Thus, the prevalence of RSB among Nepali youths might be significantly greater than what the research indicates. There is a pressing need for further research into this issue.There are numerous instances where people’s travel has been halted upon testing positive for syphilis because evidence of “no syphilis” is considered a crucial health requirement in employer health assessments abroad. Although treatment can cure the disease, the markers for syphilis often remain in blood tests. This appears to put young people in a difficult situation, especially financially, as they may have already incurred significant expenses by that time.We cannot ignore the fact that syphilis is spreading at an alarming rate among young adults in Nepal. It can be inferred that having multiple sexual partners and engaging in unsafe sexual practices without proper awareness contributed to the growing prevalence of syphilis among Nepali youths. Establishing an environment that fosters open dialogue and education regarding \"reproductive and sexual health\" among young people could significantly mitigate the challenges of rising syphilis infection in the country.  \nThe November 27 review meeting of the government’s performance in the first quarter of the current fiscal year (2024-25) was reportedly a big disappointment to the ministers and secretaries. Prime Minister KP Sharam Oli lambasted the dismal performance of key ministries and was irked by the worrisome economic indicators.Nepali economy reels under unpalatable paradoxical indicators. On the upside, the current account surplus is Rs112 billion, whereas the balance of payment is also in surplus of Rs185 billion. Further, the remittance inflow is impressive, with more than 10 percent growth. The foreign currency reserve is the highest in Nepal's history, touching $16.6 billion. The loanable liquidity available in the banking system has crossed Rs700 billion. Similarly, the non-performing assets in banks and financial institutions have gone up to 4.5 percent of disbursement. In its first quarterly review published last week, the Nepal Rastra Bank has chosen not to change its main monetary policy stance.During the first four months of the current fiscal year, till mid-November, merchandise exports were only Rs46 billion against the import of Rs513.4 billion. Capital expenditure remains pathetic at less than 11 percent of the capital allocation of Rs357 billion while it should have crossed at least 35 percent on average. Similarly, revenue collection is short of its quarterly target by about 15 percent. However, public debt is expanding exponentially, crossing 45 percent of the national gross domestic product (GDP) at Rs5.7 trillion. Development partners have not released any grants so far during the last four months of the fiscal year, and public financial management has thus become increasingly challenging.An agonising question here is: Despite some strong fiscal and monetary fundamentals as indicated above, why has the economic administration of the state failed to utilise them and waded through a widespread loss of confidence among investors, consumers and players in the market? Apparently, the reason for economic underperformance and pessimism is not only the inadequacy of financial resources but also the lack of failure in the overall economic management of the government on both fiscal and non-fiscal fronts. Economic managementEconomic management covers the quality of three closely related policy areas: Fiscal and monetary policies and sovereign debt. It is almost everything about an economy’s operation and governance.Despite shrinking revenue and alarmingly ebbing financial assistance from its development partners, managing a smooth stream of financial resources has been the greatest challenge to Nepal's fiscal policy or budget balance. Over the decades, subsequent governments have failed to consolidate their tax base and tax net, and undermined the importance of exploring new sources of capital to flow into the economy. Overdependence on import-based revenue is antithetical to the very idea of making the economy self-sustainable. The cause of concern is that the sovereign has barely demonstrated the management skills required to bridge the development financing gap, which is becoming herculean with time.Nepal Government’s official review report states that “to achieve the targets of the 2030 Agenda (Sustainable Development Goals and Paris Agreement 2030), a total investment of $163 billion is required for 2024-30, i.e. more than $23 billion per year”. This is an impossible task given that Nepal's total national budget in actual is barely $10 billion. Unless the government demonstrates its creative resource management ability, our dream of development and prosperity will not even be partially realised.The second glaring challenge is the lack of capacity for resource absorption at the government’s executing units, from federal ministries to ward offices in municipalities. Not only has the capital budget allocation come to 18 percent of the total budget outlay, but only about 60 percent of it is spent. This is purely a question of management efficiency at all levels: Project prioritisation, project implementation and project management at the ground level.Third, the biggest hurdle for the provincial and local levels is the lack of skilled human resources with economic understanding and management skills. Finding and maintaining human resources with thematic and sectoral competence, even at the provincial level, for planning, prioritisation, public procurement, plan implementation, expenditure effectiveness and expenditure monitoring is proving daunting. The situation is far more dire at the municipality level. Due to the lack of efficient economic management in all three tiers of the government, the necessity to review formulas of equalisation, grant allocation, revenue and other financial resource sharing does not seem to be the priority of the dispensation. After almost a decade of fiscal federalism, it is now imperative to have an evidence-based approach to review the institutional and operational efficacy of the gamut of public financial management under the federal polity.Emerging challengesEvidently, Nepal's conventional economic management paradigm faces challenges stemming from the vicious cycle of low resource availability and efficiency and low level of economic output (growth). A peek into the future brings about a new set of challenges to the fore. Among dozens of issues, three problems warrant immediate policy attention.One, Nepal's political and bureaucratic decision-making process has summarily failed to take the state’s federal architecture into due cognisance. Such evasion, omission and ad-hocism are more pronounced in economic and financial matters.Two, a critical departure is inevitable to manage the trade-off between Nepal's acute infrastructural social development needs and the obligation to make all these sustainable and environment-friendly. The unequivocal necessity to reduce the risk of climate change-induced disasters and prepare for post-disaster rescue, relief and rehabilitation compels us to source additional financial resources and their effective mobilisation.Finally, like any other developing country, Nepal's prospects of catching up to become a digitally advanced and knowledge-centric nation are contingent on its ability to invest in these capital-intensive endeavours. To bridge the growing digital divide across regions, ethnicities, economic classes and genders, effective economic management would entail not only finding the financial means but also involving a substantial social capital for judicious outcomes from every drop of the nation's investment. \nOnce, human rights were understood as the simple principle that one person’s rights should never extend beyond the tip of another’s nose unless invited. On December 10 each year, the world comes together to observe International Human Rights Day, a day that underscores the inherent dignity and the equal and inalienable rights of all members of the human family. First recognised in 1950 under the guidance of the United Nations, this day has evolved into a global call to action for the protection and promotion of human rights worldwide. Yet, despite decades of progress, violations persist across the globe, reminding us that the fight for human rights is far from over. The debate on human rights dates back centuries, and two of the most prominent figures in this discourse Edmund Burke and Thomas Paine left a lasting legacy that continues to resonate today.Burke, a supporter of the monarchy, saw the preservation of tradition and hierarchy as essential to societal stability, while Paine, a revolutionary thinker, championed liberty, equality, and the rights of individuals. One of Paine’s most famous lines, “We pity the plumage, but forget the dying bird,” directly addressed the hypocrisy of focusing on superficial issues while ignoring the deeper, more urgent concerns. In modern times, these words still carry weight, highlighting how we often address surface-level concerns while systemic injustices persist, unnoticed or unchallenged. The observance of Human Rights Day invites us to reflect on the progress made and the work still to be done. It is a reminder that the principles outlined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR), adopted by the United Nations General Assembly on 10 December 1948, remain crucial in shaping a more just and equitable world.However, despite the ground-breaking achievements of the UDHR, widespread violations continue, and the fight for human dignity remains on-going. Throughout history, the struggle for human rights has been a journey fraught with obstacles. One notable turning point in this struggle occurred in the United States during the 19th century. The abolition of slavery, a monumental achievement, came about through the tireless efforts of leaders like Abraham Lincoln, who, in 1863, led the nation to abolish the institution through the 13th Amendment to the Constitution. This was a transformative moment in the history of human rights. Despite the victory, however, African-Americans continued to face systemic discrimination and segregation for many years after.The 1954 landmark decision in Brown v. Board of Education, where the US Supreme Court declared racial segregation in public schools unconstitutional, was another significant victory for human rights in America. But even after this, African-Americans had to fight for basic rights like access to education, the vote, and an end to discriminatory laws. It was only in 1965, after decades of struggle and advocacy by civil rights leaders like Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., that African-Americans were granted the right to vote under the Voting Rights Act. These achievements were monumental, but they were hard-won, demonstrating the lengths to which marginalised communities had to go in order to claim their human rights. Internationally, the story of human rights has also been one of continuous struggle and progress.The United Nations’ adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in 1948 was a defining moment. It set out, for the first time, a global standard for human rights, affirming the rights of individuals to life, liberty, and security, among other freedoms. The UDHR became the foundation upon which many countries would base their own human rights frameworks. But the road to realising these rights in full has not been easy. Over the decades, the UDHR has been supplemented by two essential covenants—the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the International Covenant on Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights—passed in 1966 to reinforce and clarify the rights outlined in the UDHR.One of the key figures behind the development of the UDHR was Eleanor Roosevelt, who, as the chairperson of the UN Human Rights Commission, played a pivotal role in its creation. Known as the “mother of modern human rights,” Roosevelt’s vision for a world where all people were treated equally and with dignity shaped the discourse on human rights for generations. Unfortunately, she did not live to see the full impact of the UDHR, passing away in 1962, but her legacy lives on. Since 1998, the Eleanor Roosevelt Award for Human Rights has been awarded annually to individuals who have made significant contributions to the protection of human rights. As we reflect on the history of human rights, we must also acknowledge the many challenges that remain today.In the United States, for example, despite significant progress, debates about gun control and mass shootings continue to spark deep divisions. The United Nations and various human rights organisations have called for greater restrictions on firearms, but powerful interest groups like the National Rifle Association (NRA) continue to push back against any form of regulation. The on-going violence in schools and public places is a stark reminder that the struggle for human rights continues, and that the protection of human life and safety is an essential component of human rights. In India, human rights protections are enshrined in the Constitution, which guarantees the right to life, liberty, and equality. However, even in a country with such a strong legal framework, violations of human rights are not uncommon.Discrimination based on caste, religion, gender, and disability continues to affect millions of people across the country. While the Constitution guarantees equal rights for all, the reality often falls short. The National Human Rights Commission, which works to address these issues, plays an important role, but there is still much work to be done. The issue of discrimination remains one of the most pervasive challenges to human rights. Genderbased violence, including domestic abuse, sexual assault, and trafficking, continues to devastate the lives of women and girls around the world. In many countries, LGBTQ+ individuals face violence, discrimination, and the denial of basic rights.Refugees and migrants, fleeing war, persecution, and poverty, are often subjected to inhumane conditions and denied their rights to safety and protection. The most vulnerable members of society, including those who are stateless, face some of the most extreme forms of discrimination, and the international community must do more to protect them. On a global scale, poverty and inequality are also significant barriers to realising human rights. Despite progress in some areas, the gap between the rich and the poor continues to widen. Economic inequalities, along with the challenges posed by climate change, pose major threats to the realisation of human rights for millions of people around the world. The struggle for human rights is far from over.While progress has been made, there are still millions of people around the world who are denied their basic rights and dignity. The world must come together to address the root causes of discrimination, inequality, and violence. Human rights are not just abstract concepts; they are the foundation of a just and peaceful world. As we observe International Human Rights Day later this month, we must renew our commitment to these principles and work to ensure that they are upheld for all people, everywhere.The fight for human rights is not just the responsibility of governments or international organisations. It is a responsibility shared by all of us, whether through advocacy, education, or simply standing up for justice. We must remember the words of Eleanor Roosevelt, “Where, after all, do universal human rights begin? In small places, close to home.” It is in our homes, our communities, and our everyday actions that the future of human rights will be determined.—The Statesman (India)/ANN \nThe Nepal Premier League, which kicked off on Saturday, has taken the country by storm. Never before had a national-level tournament created such buzz among domestic and international audiences. Nepali cricket fanbase, who grew up watching the Indian Premier League, are now ecstatic to have their own truly international franchise league comprising no less than eight teams. The fact that people from different parts of the country are travelling to the Tribhuvan University Cricket Ground to cheer on their favourite teams speaks volumes about the tournament’s mass appeal.The ‘Festival of Himalayas’ features big cricketing names like former Indian opener Shikhar Dhawan, New Zealand all-rounder James Neesham, Dutch Michael Levitt, Namibia’s Gerhard Erasmus, and Australia’s Ben Cutting. Nepali cricketers—both national players and newcomers—will now get to rub shoulders with these global cricket superstars, which will greatly boost their confidence. The NPL will also hopefully offer these players enough financial incentives to pursue cricket as a profession. In fact, the recent all-format international success of the Indian national team is often attributed to the IPL, for some of the same reasons. The start of the NPL this year could thus mark a sea-change in Nepal’s success in international cricket. The league will have a global audience after getting the Star Sports Network, an internationally established TV network, as the official broadcaster; and after partnering with the Twenty-first Century Media Sports, a company that has managed many international events. They will help showcase Nepal as a global cricket destination. No wonder Nepali cricket fans are upbeat. As one fan placard during Saturday’s opening match between Janakpur Bolts and Biratnagar Kings put it: “No matter who wins it is the victory of Nepali cricket.”Done well, the NPL’s success will resonate much beyond the international sports scene. The vast majority of Nepali youths are looking to leave the country the first opportunity they get. They see no hope in their country. But when they see that cricketers and commentators and organisers from around the world are coming to their homeland to play as professionals, perhaps this feeling of disenchantment with their native country will go down a bit. Additionally, if Nepal can successfully pull off an international tournament like the NPL, there is no reason this welcoming country cannot host tournaments like the cricket Asia Cup. But there will also be challenges. The Cricket Association of Nepal has taken up the monumental task of organising an eight-team tournament. The association’s history of managing similar tournaments is checkered. For instance, the CAN-organised Nepal T20 League in 2022-23 was marred by controversies even before it kicked off due to allegations about match-fixing. The body has also faced criticisms for negligence, delayed payments and incompetence. Even in the opening match of the NPL on Saturday, the association failed to manage the crowd, which in turn led to injuries. The next day, fans were seen running on to the cricket pitch at the completion of a match. In order to maintain the integrity of Nepali cricket, it is vital to minimise such incidents. Hopefully, the CAN is learning with every match. The CAN must get the NPL right, for the tournament’s benefits are potentially limitless. The millions of international TV viewers of the NPL will get to see what a beautiful country Nepal is and this in turn could boost the country’s tourism prospects. The NPL itself, linked to a multitude of stakeholders, can create many profitable jobs, especially as other stadiums are built and the tournament expands to other parts of Nepal. Exciting times, indeed.  \nPrime Minister KP Sharma Oli heads to China today amid a heated debate on the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). At the centre of the debate is an argument over whether Nepal should accept only grants to develop bilateral Nepal-China projects or such projects can also be built with loans. In the end, the two main ruling parties—the Nepali Congress and the CPN-UML—decided that there would be no loan deals during Oli’s China trip. The Congress had been adamant that Nepal cannot afford any more loans and as such there was no question of adding a financial burden to the country. As things stand, 12 projects are lined up for signing. An agreement on the ‘BRI framework for cooperation’ is also likely, which, at least in theory, should add momentum to old and new bilateral projects. There are multiple readings of the two ruling parties’ disagreements on negotiating with the Chinese. In one, the Congress, as the biggest ruling party, played a dubious role by unnecessarily tying the prime minister’s hands before an important visit.Oli, in this reading, won’t have much to show at the end of the trip. Yet there can be an alternate and more charitable reading of the recent sequence of events—and one which will be more salubrious to the country’s interests. The BRI became so controversial on the eve of Oli’s China trip precisely because there was lack of clarity on what being a part of it entailed for Nepal. When the country signed up to the initiative’s framework agreement back in 2017, there was little debate even as grey areas galore. For instance, the document Nepal signed seven years ago is yet to be made public, fanning many speculations. In this context, the new debate on the kind of cooperation the country can expect under the BRI was much needed. Unlike in the past when they were querulous opponents, this time, as coalition partners, the Congress and the UML were forced to come to an understanding on the initiative. They did this through a four-member taskforce that carefully dissected the new China-proposed framework. The Nepali side has tweaked the new BRI framework document in line with the suggestions of the taskforce and sent it back to China for final approval. Nepal has long felt the need for a broad political understanding on vital foreign policy issues. Yet such an understanding has invariably been made a victim to top leaders’ never-ending jockeying for power. This time, the differences between the Congress and the UML over the BRI, and the wider debate it sparked, have helped the country arrive at a more nuanced position on how to engage with China, one of Nepal’s two most important foreign friends. The deals Prime Minister Oli locks up in Beijing matter. But, more importantly, the decision of the country’s two biggest political forces to devise a common platform on a vital foreign policy issue bodes well for Nepal. If and when Oli goes to India, perhaps the two parties can come up with a similar common position. And the same while dealing with other important foreign actors. The sum of these understandings can in turn form a solid basis for a more consensus based Nepali foreign policy. Perhaps this extrapolation is a little simplistic. But the goal of greater consensus looks more achievable today than it did even a week ago.  \nAs the world marks the 16 days of activism against gender-based violence (GBV) with the International Day for the Elimination of Violence Against Women starting November 25, it bears recalling the different forms of violence inflicted upon women and young girls and how effective these campaigns are. According to the United Nations, one in three women globally experiences physical or sexual violence in their lifetime. The reality is dire in Nepal too. The Demographic Health Survey 2022 reveals that one in three Nepali women aged 15-49 has experienced some form of violence. Further, with the rise of technology, women have been experiencing harassment, non-consensual sexting, hate and fear in online spaces. The unresolved and harrowing rape-and-murder of Nirmala Panta is an example of the pervasive and enduring nature of GBV in Nepal.Campaigns and activism hold great promise to challenge and confront the violence women face. In Nepal, the government, non-profit organisations and international agencies join hands to discuss the issues of women and find practical solutions. Yet their actions are mostly urban-centric, with rallies and programmes not reaching the grassroots level. For countless Nepali women in rural areas who face multiple layers of marginalisation, these 16 days offer little in terms of solace or change. Words don’t translate into actions even as their issues get the centre stage. Apparently, despite having abundant legal frameworks against GBV, Nepal ranks 71 out of 190 economies in the World Bank’s Women, Business and the Law Safety indicator, which focuses on four key areas: child marriage, sexual harassment, domestic violence and femicide. The UN’s report “Femicides in 2023” states that “home is the most dangerous place for women”. Nepal is no exception, as out of 21,568 cases of violence against women reported between July 2021 and July 2022, 80 percent were related to domestic violence. And intimate partner violence—a subset of domestic violence—remains the most challenging issue to tackle. Meanwhile, with the rise of artificial intelligence, deepfakes of women have become common. Our outdated cyber laws fail to cover new threats against women and leave them ever-vulnerable in online spaces; Nepal remains far behind in addressing technology-facilitated gender violence. While this slow progress is partly due to the enduring severity of domestic and intimate partner violence, which demands significant attention and resources from the government and other stakeholders, it would be dangerous to overlook online forms of violence against women. For women going through physical and mental trauma brought about by various forms of violence, no lofty words pronounced at forums offer relief. Addressing such pervasive issues needs practical actions like making them capable enough to recognise and resist domestic violence. It is also vital to goad survivors to break silence about the abuse they face, as according to the 2022 health survey, 58 percent of women who experience physical and sexual violence don’t seek support or speak up. If they did speak up, it would be much easier for police and other authorities to intervene and help. Yet more can be done. Alongside designated days to counter violence against women, as many women’s rights activists emphasise, there should also be year-round advocacy on GBV. Sensitising men about violence against women and bringing—and enacting—stringent laws to dismantle the evolving structures that perpetuate gender-based violence are the bare minimum needed to build safe spaces for women. \nChina-Nepal ties have remained stable despite political changes in both nations, with China emphasizing mutual respect, adherence to the \"One China\" principle, economic cooperation, and a peaceful and stable Nepal.\nFormer Indian chief election commissioner SY Quraishi advocates for credible elections and inclusive democracy, discussing the rise of right-wing movements, the role of money in elections, the impact of social media and artificial intelligence on electoral processes, and the benefits and challenges of \"one nation, one election\" in India.\nJames Neesham, a renowned New Zealand all-rounder, will debut in Nepal's Premier League (NPL) for Janakpur Bolts, bringing his vast experience from global cricket leagues.\nPolitical scientist Mehta discusses populism, India's foreign policy, including relations with China, Nepal, and the US, emphasizing the importance of social media, geo-strategy, and economic interests in international diplomacy.\nPrime Minister KP Sharma Oli's upcoming visit to China aims to enhance bilateral relations, prioritize project implementation, and seek infrastructure support, while ensuring that India's concerns are not escalated. Despite past delays in Chinese-supported development projects, Oli aims to negotiate grant conversions and expedite cross-border connectivity projects, balancing Nepal's relations with both its neighbors.\nKoshi Province's hills expect partly cloudy conditions Wednesday, while the rest of Nepal will remain mostly fair, with Janakpur experiencing the highest temperature and Jumla the lowest.\nOn Tuesday, the hilly regions of Koshi Province will experience partial cloud cover during the day, while other areas will remain mainly clear. During the night, hilly areas of Koshi, Gandaki, and Lumbini provinces will see some clouds, but the weather across other parts will remain predominantly clear. Janakpur recorded the highest temperature at 31.0°C, while Jumla registered the lowest at -3.5°C on Monday. No rainfall was reported across the country during the last 24 hours. \nThe Meteorological Forecasting Division has predicted partly cloudy conditions in the hilly areas of Koshi, Bagmati, and Gandaki provinces on Monday, while the rest of the country is expected to experience mainly fair weather. There is a possibility of light snowfall in one or two locations in the high hilly and mountainous regions of Karnali Province. Tonight, the weather will remain partly cloudy in the hilly areas of Koshi, Bagmati, and Gandaki provinces, with fair skies in the rest of the country. The Division said that the country is experiencing a moderate influence of the western winds. On Sunday, Janakpur recorded the highest temperature at 31°C, while Jumla experienced the lowest at -3.1°C. No rainfall was recorded across the country in the last 24 hours, according to the Meteorological Forecasting Division.  \nThe weather is expected to remain partly cloudy in Koshi Province, Madhesh Province, and the hilly regions of Gandaki and Karnali provinces on Sunday, with mainly fair conditions elsewhere.Light snowfall is possible at one or two locations in Gandaki and Karnali provinces’ high hilly and mountainous areas.Tonight, similar conditions will prevail, with partly cloudy skies in the hilly areas of Koshi, Gandaki, and Karnali provinces, and fair weather across the rest of the country.The Meteorological Forecasting Division attributes these conditions to the influence of a westerly wind system and Cyclone “Phenjol” in the Bay of Bengal.On Saturday, Janakpur recorded the highest temperature in the country at 32.6°C, while Jumla experienced the lowest at -4.4°C. Kathmandu’s temperatures ranged between 19.9°C and 7.0°C.  \n\nBe elaborative as possible. I need more text. Text only no title or headings.

Though still a developing nation, Nepal was a land of profound beauty and deep-rooted cultural heritage. The residents of Nepal faced many challenges, but beneath these hardships lay a resilient spirit and an unyielding hope for the future.\n\nThis enchanting land, where Mount Everest reaches towards the skies and the air carries a mix of incense and cool mountain breezes, was more than a geographical marvel. It was a mosaic of cultures, languages, and traditions, a testament to human endeavor against all odds. Nepal's history, from the unification under King Prithvi Narayan Shah to its transformation into a federal democratic republic, told a story of aspiration and endurance.\n\nIn recent years, the people of Nepal, with their indomitable will, had taken strides towards rebuilding and reimagining their country. They turned their struggles into stepping stones, each challenge a chapter in their ongoing saga. The shift from a monarchy to a republic had not only changed governance but had woven a new tapestry of democratic values and collective decision-making.\n\nEconomically, while agriculture continued to sustain a large part of its population, Nepal had begun to harness the potential of its picturesque landscapes, developing sustainable tourism that promised to preserve their natural heritage while boosting local economies. Communities living in the shadows of the Himalayas had become stewards of the earth, protecting the biodiversity that made their country unique.\n\nEach day brought new stories. Whether it was a festival in Kathmandu, a technological advance in Pokhara, or a conservation effort in Chitwan, these events were threads in the vibrant quilt of Nepali life. These stories, updated daily, reflected the pulse of progress and the spirit of hope that characterized this resilient nation.\n\nAnd so, as Nepal moved forward, each moment was not just a passage of time but a promise of potential, a narrative of a nation perennially climbing towards tomorrow, guided by the legacy of its past and the dreams of its future.\n\nNews events:\nSeven years and seven months after inking the Memorandum of Understanding on the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), Nepal and China on Wednesday signed a framework for BRI cooperation during Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli’s China visit, which ends on Thursday.Acting Foreign Secretary Amrit Bahadur Rai and deputy head of China’s National Development and Reform Commission Liu Sushe signed the framework cooperation on behalf of the respective countries. The commission is the focal agency in China, tasked with the development of BRI projects.The framework will be valid for three years and will get another three-year extension unless terminated by either side.Speaking briefly from Beijing with the Post, Foreign Minister Arzu Rana Deuba said that the framework signed on Wednesday is not new. “It should be understood as a continuation of the memorandum of understanding signed in 2017,” she added.A joint task force of the Nepali Congress and the CPN-UML, the two largest parties and ruling partners, in Kathmandu had tweaked the original BRI implementation plan proposed by the Chinese side in 2020.Wednesday’s development formally endorses Nepal’s involvement in the BRI, a programme China proposed and Nepal initially signed in 2017. But negotiations on the projects under the BRI could still prove difficult in the future.‘Aid financing modalities’, as have been agreed under the new framework, have elements of both grant and loan, said one Nepali official who is a part of Oli’s delegation in Beijing.“Even as we signed the framework, we were clear that we cannot accept projects under the BRI with interest rates exceeding those charged by bilateral and multilateral donors,” the official said. “Our focus would be on seeking grants and concessional loans in line with the interest rates offered by the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank and other bilateral and multilateral agencies.”Wednesday’s agreement paves the way for negotiations on the ten projects that Nepal had proposed to China.“Today, we signed the Framework for Belt and Road Cooperation,” Prime Minister Oli wrote in his X account. “I am honoured to reflect on the bilateral talks with Premier Li Qiang, discussions with National People’s Congress of China Chairman Zhao Leji and the highly fruitful meeting with President Xi Jinping.”The economic cooperation between Nepal and China will further strengthen under the Belt and Road Framework Cooperation, writes Oli.Just ahead of the prime minister’s departure for Beijing on Monday, the Nepali side had sent a new version of the framework for BRI cooperation and insisted on grants as the project financing model. But the Chinese side objected to the words and replaced them with ‘assistance financing’ and sent the document back to the Nepali side for consideration.“Then we sat again, spoke with the prime minister and proposed a middle path using the phrase ‘aid financing’ as a modality,” one Nepali member of the delegation told the Post from Beijing over the phone. “The Chinese took some time to consider our proposal. Therefore, the new BRI framework is missing in the joint communiqué released late Tuesday. Eventually, both parties agreed on the term ‘aid assistance financing’ and the agreement was signed on Wednesday.” On Nepal’s side, the negotiations were led by Prime Minister Oli’s economic and development adviser Yubaraj Khatiwada, Foreign Minister Arzu Rana Deuba and Acting Foreign Secretary Rai. High-ranking foreign ministry officials represented the Chinese delegation.As Nepal and China are in different stages of development, projects will be selected on the basis of Nepal’s specific requirements and needs. During project negotiation, the final BRI framework agreement states, both sides should uphold the principle of technical, financial, commercial and economic viability and value for money. Likewise, both sides will work to create a conducive business environment.The ‘Objective’ of the BRI framework cooperation states that both sides should facilitate the financial and technical cooperation for each project, and they identified the areas of cooperation—economic development, financial sector cooperation, transport, connectivity and logistic cooperation, trade industrial capacity and investment cooperation, and customs clearance—according to another member of the Nepali delegation who is in Beijing.Nepal has proposed ten different projects to be executed under the BRI. They are Tokha-Chhahare tunnel road, Hilsa-Simikot road project, Kimathanka-Khandbari road and bridge, Jilong-Kerung-Kathmandu cross-border railway, Amargadhi City Hall in Dadeldhura, Jilong-Kerung-Rasuwagadhi-Chilime 220KV transmission line, Madan Bhandari University, Kathmandu Scientific Centre and Science Museum, China-Nepal friendship industrial park in Damak and Jhapa sports and athletic complex.Nepal will set priorities and prepare the implementation plan for each of these projects. The Nepali side, in the negotiation phase, had changed several proposals.The Nepali side significantly shortened the list of priority areas originally proposed by the Chinese side in early 2020 which included construction of the Trans-Himalayan Multi Dimensional Connectivity Network, including ports, roads, bridges, tunnels, highways, railways, aviation infrastructure, telecom projects, electricity transmission line, carrying out the China-Nepal cross-border railway project.Similarly, the two sides will develop implementation plans for energy related projects, cooperation in the field of e-commerce and trade and industrial capacity enhancement, building trade infrastructures, adopting trade and investment liberalisation, and expanding bilateral economic relationship.The BRI framework provides significant impetus for a stronger economic and project development partnership between the two countries, said Semanta Dahal, who was part of the task force that revised the BRI framework on behalf of the ruling coalition in a capacity of legal adviser. He added that it addresses ambiguities surrounding the infrastructure projects to be implemented under the BRI in Nepal and establishes clear negotiation principles, including the use of aid financing.“This will facilitate negotiations on a project-by-project basis and ensure that infrastructure and connectivity projects offer value for money,” he said. \nAmid a delay in publishing a shortlist of office-bearer candidates for the two transitional justice commissions, a section of the human rights activists has expressed concern over suspected attempts to pick candidates on partisan basis.In a statement on Wednesday, they claimed that conspiracies are being hatched against the selection of office bearers through a competitive process.“Such unwarranted political interference in the selection process will once again put the transitional justice process at risk and undermine the national goal of completing the remaining tasks of the peace process,” reads the statement.They are concerned as the committee formed to recommend the chairpersons and members of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission and the Commission of Investigation on Enforced Disappeared Persons struggles to publish a shortlist more than two weeks after the extended application deadline ended.Against the claim that it would shortlist the candidates latest by November end, the Om Prakash Mishra-led committee hasn’t been able to do so. Those aware of the developments say the selection committee is waiting for the consent of the top leadership of three major parties. In particular, it awaits the return of Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli, who also is CPN-UML chairperson, from China before publishing the shortlist. Though the committee has already met the top leaders individually, it wants Oli, Nepali Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba and CPN (Maoist Centre) chairperson Pushpa Kamal Dahal to get their approvals on the names.The committee had received 156 applications from retired judges, government officials, legal experts, rights defenders, and the victims of the decade-long Maoist insurgency. However, it considered only 128 names, claiming that the remaining 28 individuals were recommended by different organisations without their personal consent. The Mishra-led panel wants to include some of the 28 names after getting their consent. Yet, these personnel being considered apparently won’t give their consent unless their appointments are assured. In addition, the selection committee is under pressure to recommend Sudip Pathak, a former member of the National Human Rights Commission, to chair a commission. However, the victims and human rights defenders are against his nomination. This puts the committee in a fix.Without naming Pathak, the rights defenders’ statement stresses that individuals with questionable integrity, those who courted controversies in their past constitutional responsibilities and the ones who have failed to gain legitimacy from the victims’ communities and civil society should not be recommended for transitional justice commissions. It would be unacceptable for such persons to be included in the selection process, as it would make the entire process contentious, reads the statement.“Pathak has a controversial image as a member of the human rights commission. The statement is targeted at him,” one of the signatories to the statement told the Post. A group of victims and human rights defenders on Wednesday met Deuba to draw his attention against Pathak’s nomination. In response, Deuba said he has already given his word to Pathak but was still ready to reconsider if there are better alternatives, according to a member of the group who spoke to the Congress leader.On Tuesday, victims’ representatives, along with some human rights activists, met United Nations Resident Coordinator Hanaa Singer-Hamdy to discuss the UN’s role in the overall transitional justice process. “We also discussed the impartiality in the selection of the office bearers,” Gopal Shah, chairperson of the Conflict Victims National Network, told the Post.The statement undersigned by Sushil Pyakurel, Subodh Pyakurel, Kanak Mani Dixit, Kundan Aryal, Charan Prasai, Mandira Sharma, Rajan Kuikel, Raju Prasad Chapagain and Suman Adhikari says the credibility and success of the entire transitional justice process depends on the selection of officials who have the capacity to fulfill the huge responsibility of transitional justice. “We, therefore, strongly urge the recommendation committee to carry out the selection process independently, impartially, and transparently without any compromise,” reads the statement. “We want to warn the recommendation committee that failure to carry out their duties properly would be a betrayal to the nation.”The selection committee, however, says it wants to recommend the best candidates for the 10 positions—five members each, including the chair, in the two commissions—and it was taking time. “Checking the backgrounds, qualifications and expertise of so many candidates takes time. We plan to publish a shortlist by the end of this week,” Khamma Khati, spokesperson for the committee, told the Post. “We will recommend the best persons to lead the commissions through a fair and impartial process.” \nDuring COVID-19, Nepal faced a fertilizer shortage; in response, a couple in Rupandehi established Grow More Fertiliser and Chemical, producing the first granulated organic fertilizer in Nepal, with plans to supply it to farmers' doorsteps and replace chemical fertilizers.\nKathmandu Gurkhas and Biratnagar Kings notched their first wins in the Nepal Premier League T20 tournament, with Karan KC and Lokesh Bam starring in their respective victories over Karnali Yaks and Lumbini Lions.\nPresident Paudel underwent prostate surgery successfully at TUTH, after struggling with prostate problems for years.\nJanakpur Bolts remained undefeated in the NPL, registering a third consecutive win with a seven-wicket triumph over Pokhara Avengers despite Pokhara's Matthew Cross top-scoring with 35 runs.\nResults of the Nepalese by-elections reveal a shift in voters' preferences away from new political forces and towards traditional parties, with the CPN (Maoist Centre) gaining seats while the Nepali Congress and CPN-UML lost some.\nHindu monk's arrest ignites tensions between India and Bangladesh, leading to protests, clashes, and diplomatic fallout, straining bilateral relations and raising concerns over minority safety.\nIn under four months, tenth graders all over Nepal will appear in the School Education Examination (SEE). This is a time for students to focus on final preparations. Sadly, hard work alone won’t yield better results when the schools and curriculum fail to cater to their needs. Every year, when the results are out, many students have to endure crushing failure. However, as in previous years, the authorities have failed to learn from their mistakes. Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli is making baseless predictions of a 70 percent pass rate in the upcoming SEE. How will this be achieved in a country where pass rates have for years hovered below 50 percent?Among 464,785 students who appeared in the last SEE, only 222,472—47.87 percent—secured a Grade Point Average (GPA) above 1.60, which is necessary to study at a higher level. However, 242,313 students—52.13 percent—were categorised as non-graded. After the supplementary exams, over a third of them were graded, qualifying them to study in grade 11. Oli’s forecast is only plausible if the results improve by around 50 percent, which is unlikely. The grading system was introduced in 2016 to reform the examination system, focusing less on marks and more on interactive learning. But the hangover of the old School Leaving Certificate (SLC) exams persists. While the system has been upgraded, the teaching and learning are still the same. Schools are grappling with a shortage of teachers for major subjects like Science, Mathematics and English. Rural provinces like Karnali have suffered the most and some schools are hiring under-qualified teachers to fill the gaps. With teachers unable to address their problems, students have no choice but to rely on rote learning. To cope, the government is focusing on extra online classes. But such online classes for school students hold only symbolic value. In Nepal, fear has always been a tool for teaching and learning. Most schools do not foster an environment where students enjoy learning. This mentality also applies to how the education system views examinations like SEE. Students are put under pressure to perform well, as if it were a “do or die” situation. The shame of failure scars students for life. Some private schools take advantage of this fragile emotional state of students by enforcing mandatory tuition classes. Further, as schools in rural areas can’t complete the syllabus on time, it creates an opportunity for private tuition centres to generate profit as students migrate a few months before SEE to study in such centres. During this year’s SEE, over 500 grade 10 students across Bajhang were studying in tuition centres.Schedule 8 of the constitution gives local units the authority to manage school education. But the lack of a Federal Education Act, a must to implement constitutional provisions, is a big hurdle towards this laudable goal. Among its various flaws, the controversial Education Bill, registered in Parliament last year, fails to establish minimum criteria for establishing schools. The government must realise that the basics must be fulfilled before setting lofty goals. There must be mechanisms to recruit qualified teachers and retain them. It is also imperative to update the pedagogy for courses such as BEd and MEd to produce quality teachers. The SEE marks the culmination of over a decade of schooling. Therefore, it is unfair to blame the students who have trusted the system for long. The poor SEE results are a direct reflection of the system’s failure. Whether we have the SEE or the SLC, the flawed education system will continue to jeopardise the future of hundreds of thousands of young students.  \nPrime Minister Khadga Prasad Sharma Oli chose New York as his first visit abroad to attend the 79th United Nations General Assembly. He held a 45-minute-long meeting on the sidelines with his Indian counterpart, Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Sharma Oli described the talk as ‘positive’. Modi termed it ‘very good’. Shorn of diplomatese, both statements implied that the meeting had failed to restore mutual trust between them.It took Premier Sharma Oli a while to get an invitation from his Chinese counterpart. The agenda of the visit had to be negotiated with the Nepali Congress, the largest party in the Pratinidhi Sabha that is keeping the government afloat. The chattering classes of Kathmandu were excited that Sharma Oli had chosen Beijing over New Delhi as his first official visit. The misplaced enthusiasm is meaningless: Beijing is politically hallowed for communists of all shades just as Banares is sacred for every pious Hindu.In any case, Nepal must be the only country where China and India are considered competitors. The Chinese economy is nearly five times bigger than India’s GDP. The military spending of Beijing is at least three times that of India. Ranked at 75, China is grouped high on the global Human Development Index (HDI) while India with its 134 score falls well below Bhutan and Bangladesh. Beijing and New Delhi aren’t in the same league.Geopolitical strategists in the capital cities of Nepal’s neighbouring countries are more fearful of Washington's intentions than those of each other. For a brief while in the 1950s, the United States worked with Indians to contain China and stop Beijing from spreading its wings in South Asia. Officially, the Ping-Pong diplomacy began in 1971, but a lot of hush-hush preparations must have been done earlier for the sudden thaw in the frozen relations.Once Chairman Mao Zedong shook the hand of President Richard Nixon on February 21, 1972, the balance of power in the world began to change irreversibly. Chairman Mao had found a stepping stone to emerge out of the well of seclusion that he had dug for the Chinese with his disastrous campaigns of the Great Leap Forward and the Cultural Revolution.Awakened dragonUnable to withstand the pressure of perestroika (restructuring) and glasnost (openness), the USSR’s downfall began with the fall of the Berlin Wall and gained momentum with the collapse of satellite regimes in East Europe. The greatest political experiment of what historian Eric Hobsbawm has called “the short twentieth century 1914-1991” completely disintegrated with the humiliating ouster of Mikhail Gorbachev. The contested concept of unipolarity did have its brief moment in the sun, but it soon dissolved when Francis Fukuyama’s The End of History? hypothesis was countered by his guru Samuel Huntington’s The Clash of Civilizations? formulation heralding the beginning of a multipolar world of contesting civilisations. Meanwhile, the Paramount Leader of China Deng Xiaoping had already started a modernisation drive in the 1980s with his oft-quoted command: “observe calmly, secure our position, cope with affairs calmly, hide our capacities and bide our time, be good at maintaining a low profile, and never claim leadership.” Exalted with the title of “core leader”, President Xi Jinping has built the structure of global ascendency on the ground that Mao broke with the help of President Nixon in the 1970s. President Deng laid the foundation with the cooperation of President Ronald Reagan in the 1980s, and President Jiang Zemin erected a scaffold of export-led growth with the collaboration of President Bill Clinton in the 1990s, which culminated in China being admitted into the World Trade Organisation.Despite its status of being the technological giant and a military superpower throughout the Cold War, Moscow lacked the economic muscle to challenge the hegemony of Washington that had been institutionalised through the Bretten Wood Sisters—the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank Group—that undergirded the global trade and industry. The legacy of the British Empire had left English as the lingua franca of a large part of the world. It helped establish Hollywood films, British publications and New York fashion as the desirable elements of the upwardly mobile lifestyle of the growing middleclass in the Third World countries. The financial hub had shifted from London to New York. The Silicon Valley in California had emerged as the nucleus of cutting-edge technology. Backed by enormous endowments, the Ivy League institutions were attracting the best and brightest of the world. All that the USSR had to offer in comparison was the theory of the inevitable collapse of capitalism. The Chinese began to grow out of all such illusions in the 1970s and have gone about building an alternative to the plutocratic capitalism of the Washington Consensus with their model of authoritarian capitalism based on the Beijing Consensus.Wounded eaglePresident Xi Jinping’s concept of “building a community with a shared future for mankind” is an outline of an alternative world order. The Chinese designs of the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO), the BRICS grouping that has more members than the acronym can accommodate, the Global Development Initiative (GDI), the Global Security Initiative (GSI), the Global Civilisation Initiative (GCI) and the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) are aimed at what has been termed as “Making China Great Again”.Just as unipolarity is an oxymoron, multipolarity is merely a desire of emerging nations for a seat at the high table. Ultimately, they must coalesce around a country with the determination and wherewithal to offer an alternative to the existing world order. Even though the Russians hosted the 16th annual BRICS summit at Kazan, China was the power behind the throne of President Vladimir Putin. President Xi Jinping agreed “in principle to the suggestions made by Prime Minister Narendra Modi” at the summit, which is a signal to the world that India will be careful in future about encircling China on behalf of the US. The collective anxiety of the geopolitical and geoeconomic establishment in the US about the future of their unchallenged dominance for almost a century is understandable. The incoherence in the statements of President Donald Trump probably comes from the confusion of the Make America Great Again (MAGA) team that has little idea about the frustrations of many countries with American hegemony.President Trump was unintelligibly provocative—meaningless covfefe is but one example—in his first term. It seems his second stint is going to be stormier. He is promising punitive tariff hikes. That will hasten the triumph of China-centric and China-inspired Pax Autocratica over Pax Democratica. President Trump appears to be determined to complete the task begun by President Nixon in the 1970s.Premier Sharma Oli’s pilgrimage to Beijing is a sideshow. Chieftains from tributary states are often rewarded for their fidelity, and Sharma Oli is likely to comeback with enough lollipops to silence his critics at home. But Beijing will perhaps be more interested in asking that Kathmandu shift its primary loyalty from Washington to Beijing. Nepal’s diplomatic dilemma will be much more perplexing than occasionally flashing the China card at New Delhi to assert its sovereignty.  \nSouth Korean opposition lawmakers said on Thursday they would vote this weekend to impeach President Yoon Suk Yeol over his botched attempt to impose martial law, while the defence minister blamed for recommending the move resigned.Yoon’s declaration of martial law late on Tuesday sought to consolidate power, ban political activity and censor the media in Asia’s fourth-largest economy and a key US ally.It sparked outrage in the streets and concern among South Korea’s international allies.Lawmakers of the opposition Democratic Party planned to seek a vote in parliament to impeach Yoon at about 7 p.m. (1000 GMT) on Saturday, a party spokesperson told reporters.“The Yoon Suk Yeol regime’s declaration of emergency martial law caused great confusion and fear among our people,” Democratic Party lawmaker Kim Seung-won told the National Assembly earlier.Yoon’s ruling People Power Party is divided over the crisis but said it would oppose impeachment with the party in turmoil and two years left in Yoon's five-year term.The Democratic Party needs at least eight of the 108 ruling-party lawmakers to back the bill for it to pass with a two-thirds majority in the 300-seat parliament.Fighting for his political future, Yoon accepted the resignation of Defence Minister Kim Yong-hyun on Thursday and nominated his ambassador to Saudi Arabia, Choi Byung-hyuk, as a replacement, Yoon’s office said.Kim had recommended Yoon declare martial law on Tuesday, according to the interior minister, a senior military official and the opposition’s filing to impeach Yoon.Kim also ordered the deployment of troops to the parliament, Vice-Defence Minister Kim Seon-ho said, adding that he was unaware of the martial law order until Yoon declared it.“I have fundamentally opposed the mobilisation of military forces under martial law and have expressed negative opinions about it,” Kim Seon-ho told a parliament hearing on Thursday, apologising and taking responsibility for failing to prevent it.South Korea’s army chief has also offered to resign, the Yonhap news agency said.The former defence minister now faces a travel ban as prosecutors investigate the attempt to impose martial law, broadcaster YTN said. Yoon and the interior minister were also being investigated, Yonhap said.INSTABILITY ALARMSJapanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba said Japan’s “security situation may be fundamentally changed” in light of the instability in Seoul and North Korea’s rising military assertiveness.“What will happen to South Korea? There appears to be a great deal of domestic criticism and opposition,” he told parliament, adding that Yoon’s efforts to improve relations with Tokyo “must never be undermined”.There has been no reaction yet from North Korea to the drama in the South.On Wednesday, Secretary of State Antony Blinken told Reuters the United States had not been made aware in advance of Yoon’s declaration, while his deputy, Kurt Campbell, said Yoon had badly misjudged it.The United States has 28,500 troops stationed in South Korea as a legacy of the 1950-1953 Korean War.The commander of US Forces-Korea, General Paul LaCamera, warned American troops to stay vigilant, avoid areas with protests, and tell superiors of travel plans in case “something unexpected” happens.Yoon had been embraced by leaders in the West as a partner in the US-led effort to unify democracies against growing authoritarianism in China, Russia and elsewhere.But he caused unease among South Koreans by branding his critics “communist totalitarian and anti-state forces”. In November, he denied wrongdoing in response to accusations of influence-peddling against him and his wife and he has taken a hard line against labour unions. \nThe owner of a food stall in Vũng Tàu City in southern Việt Nam has been fined VNĐ125 million (US$4,900) and will have to suspend their operations for five months, in the wake of a massive food poisoning incident linked to the stall that affected over 340 individuals were affected by food poisoning, including one death.According to Bà Rịa-Vũng Tàu Province’s authorities, the owner of bánh mì shop Cô Ba on Nguyễn An Ninh Street in Ward 7 was found guilty of several violations, including selling contaminated food and failing to meet food safety standards.On November 26, multiple customers who purchased bread from the bakery reported symptoms such as stomach pain, dizziness, nausea, and diarrhoea, including a 71-year-old man who tragically succumbed after consuming the food.The affected patrons were treated at local hospitals, and all have since stabilised and been discharged, according to local authorities.According to investigations, the food poisoning was caused by contaminated pork products and raw vegetables infected with Salmonella and E. coli bacteria.Food safety remains a pressing concern in Việt Nam, particularly among street food vendors who frequently flout hygiene regulations.In a similar incident last year, a popular bánh mì shop in Hội An town in the central province of Quảng Nam was heavily fined and suspended after over 300 individuals fell ill from consuming its bread, though no fatalities were reported.-In Association with ANN \nBitcoin catapulted above $100,000 for the first time on Thursday, a milestone hailed even by sceptics as a coming-of-age for cryptocurrencies as investors bet on a friendly US administration to cement cryptos' place in financial markets.The total value of the cryptocurrency market has almost doubled over the year so far to hit a record just shy of $3.8 trillion, according to data provider CoinGecko. By comparison, Apple alone is worth about $3.7 trillion.Bitcoin’s march from the libertarian fringe to Wall Street has minted millionaires, a new asset class and popularised the concept of “decentralised finance” in a volatile and often controversial period since its creation 16 years ago.Bitcoin has more than doubled in value this year and is up more than 50% in the four weeks since Donald Trump’s sweeping election victory, which also saw a slew of pro-crypto lawmakers being elected to Congress.Once it broke $100,000 in Thursday’s Asian morning, it was soon above $103,000 and was last fetching $103,335 .“We’re witnessing a paradigm shift,” said Mike Novogratz, founder and CEO of US crypto firm Galaxy Digital.“Bitcoin and the entire digital asset ecosystem are on the brink of entering the financial mainstream - this momentum is fuelled by institutional adoption, advancements in tokenisation and payments, and a clearer regulatory path.”Trump embraced digital assets during his campaign, promising to make the United States the “crypto capital of the planet” and to accumulate a national stockpile of bitcoin.“We were trading basically sideways for about seven months, then immediately after Nov. 5, US investors resumed buying hand-over-fist,” said Joe McCann, CEO and founder of Asymmetric, a Miami digital assets hedge fund.On Wednesday, Trump said he would nominate Paul Atkins to run the Securities and Exchange Commission.Atkins, a former SEC commissioner, has been involved in crypto policy as co-chair of the Token Alliance, which works to \"develop best practices for digital asset issuances and trading platforms,\" and the Chamber of Digital Commerce.“Atkins will offer a new perspective, anchored by a deep understanding of the digital asset ecosystem,” said Blockchain Association CEO Kristin Smith.“We look forward to working with him ... and ushering in – together – a new wave of American crypto innovation.”A slew of crypto companies including Ripple, Kraken and Circle are also jostling for a seat on Trump's promised crypto advisory council.PART OF THE LANDSCAPEBitcoin has proven a survivor through precipitous downturns.Its move into six-figure territory is a remarkable comeback from a dip below $16,000 in 2022 when the industry was reeling from the collapse of the FTX exchange. Founder Sam Bankman-Fried was subsequently jailed.Analysts say the growing embrace of bitcoin by big investors this year has been a driving force behind the record-breaking rally.US-listed bitcoin exchange-traded funds were approved in January and have been a conduit for large-scale buying, with more than $4 billion streaming into these funds since the election.“Roughly 3% of the total supply of bitcoins that will ever exist have been purchased in 2024 by institutional money,” said Geoff Kendrick, global head of digital assets research at Standard Chartered.“Digital assets, as an asset class, is becoming normalised,” he said. “If you fast forward a number of years on trading floors you'll have a sales and trading desk...which will sit alongside FX and rates and commodities.”It is already becoming increasingly financialised, with the launch of bitcoin futures in 2017 and a strong debut for options on BlackRock’s ETF in November.Crypto-related stocks have soared along with the bitcoin price, with shares in bitcoin miner MARA Holdings and exchange operator Coinbase each up around 65% in November.Trump himself unveiled a new crypto business, World Liberty Financial, in September, although details have been scarce and billionaire Elon Musk, a major Trump ally, is also a proponent of cryptocurrencies.‘WHO CAN PROHIBIT IT’The cryptocurrency industry has been criticised for its massive energy usage, while crypto crime remains a concern, and the underlying technology is yet to deliver a major revolution in the way money moves around the globe.Still, as Russian President Vladimir Putin pointed out at an investment conference on Wednesday: “Who can prohibit it? No one.” And its longevity is perhaps testament to a degree of resilience.“As time goes by it's proving itself as part of the financial landscape,” said Shane Oliver, chief economist and head of investment strategy at AMP in Sydney.“I find it very hard to value it ... it’s anyone’s guess. But it does have a momentum aspect to it and at the moment the momentum is up.” \nPokhara Avengers in their second match set a target of 139 runs against Janakpur Bolts in the ongoing Nepal Premier League (NPL) at the Tribhuvan University Cricket Ground, Kirtipur on Thursday.Pokhara set the target of 139 runs at the loss of 7 wickets in 20 overs. Pokhara improved their batting compared to their first game where they could score only 74 runs against Chitwan Rhinos and lost the game by 87 runs. Openers Dinesh Kharel and Andries Gous made a partnership of 32 runs before losing their first wicket. Andries Gous 20 [off 16 balls] was bowled out by Lalit Rajbanshi while Kharel was bowled out by James Neesham. Avengers Captain Kushal Bhurtel continued his bad batting being run out at 6 [off 6 balls]. Pokhara lost their 4th wicket in 70 runs with Dilip Nath 11 [off 14 balls]. With wickets being taken down quickly by Bolt’s bowlers, Pokhara’s batting was handled by Mathew Critchley who scored 35 [off 30 balls], Raymon Reifer [17 off 20 balls] and Michael Leask, who scored 25 off 13 balls in the last over. For Janakpur Bolts Lalit Rajbanshi took 3 wickets, James Neesham took two, while Muhammad Mohsin and Kishore Mahato took a wicket each.In the second match today, Kathmandu Gurkhas are locking horns with Sudurpaschim Royals at 1:15 pm. \nFrench lawmakers passed a no-confidence vote against the government on Wednesday, throwing the European Union’s second-biggest economic power deeper into a crisis that threatens its capacity to legislate and tame a massive budget deficit.Far-right and left-wing lawmakers joined forces to back a no-confidence motion against Prime Minister Michel Barnier, with a majority of 331 votes in support of the motion.Barnier now has to tender his resignation and that of his government to President Emmanuel Macron, making his minority government’s three-month tenure the shortest lived in France’s Fifth Republic beginning in 1958. He is expected to do so on Thursday morning, French media reported.The hard left and far right punished Barnier for using special constitutional powers to adopt part of an unpopular budget without a final vote in parliament, where it lacked majority support. The draft budget had sought 60 billion euros ($63.07 billion) in savings in a drive to shrink a gaping deficit.“This (deficit) reality will not disappear by the magic of a motion of censure,” Barnier told lawmakers ahead of the vote, adding the budget deficit would come back to haunt whichever government comes next.No French government had lost a confidence vote since Georges Pompidou’s in 1962. Macron ushered in the crisis by calling a snap election in June that delivered a polarised parliament.With its president diminished, France now risks ending the year without a stable government or a 2025 budget, although the constitution allows special measures that would avert a US-style government shutdown.France’s political turmoil will further weaken a European Union already reeling from the implosion of Germany’s coalition government, and weeks before US President-elect Donald Trump returns to the White House.The country's outgoing defence minister Sebastien Lecornu warned the turmoil could impact French support for Ukraine.The hard left France Unbowed (LFI) party demanded Macron’s resignation.Barnier’s demise was cheered by far-right chief Marine Le Pen, who has sought for years to portray her National Rally party as a government in waiting.“I’m not pushing for Macron’s resignation,” she said. “The pressure on the president will get greater and greater. Only he will make that decision.”NO EASY EXIT FROM FRENCH POLITICAL CRISISFrance now faces a period of deep political uncertainty that is already unnerving investors in French sovereign bonds and stocks. Earlier this week, France's borrowing costs briefly exceeded those of Greece, generally considered far more risky.Macron must now make a choice. The Elysee Palace said the president would address the nation on Thursday evening.Three sources told Reuters that Macron aimed to install a new prime minister swiftly, with one saying he wanted to name a premier before a ceremony to reopen the Notre-Dame Cathedral on Saturday, which Trump is due to attend.Any new prime minister would face the same challenges as Barnier in getting bills, including the 2025 budget, adopted by a divided parliament. There can be no new parliamentary election before July.Macron could alternatively ask Barnier and his ministers to stay on in a caretaker capacity while he takes time to identify a prime minister able to attract sufficient cross-party support to pass legislation.A caretaker government could either propose emergency legislation to roll the tax-and-spend provisions in the 2024 budget into next year, or invoke special powers to pass the draft 2025 budget by decree - though jurists say this is a legal grey area and the political cost would be huge.Macron’s opponents also could vote down one prime minister after the next.ECONOMIC PAINThe upheaval is not without risk for Le Pen.Macron allies sought to present her as an agent of chaos after her party joined forces with the left to down Barnier.“The French will harshly judge the choice you are going to make,” Laurent Wauquiez, a lawmaker from the conservative Les Republicains party who backs Macron, told Le Pen in parliament.Since Macron called the summer snap election, France’s CAC 40 benchmark stock market index has dropped nearly 10% and is the heaviest loser among top EU economies.The euro EUR=EBS showed little immediate reaction versus the dollar, trading for around $1.05 per euro, but dipping against other European currencies, such as the Swiss franc and the pound.“I’m amazed the euro hasn’t moved much,” said Nick Rees, senior foreign exchange market analyst at Monex Europe. “There are two major powers in Europe, France and Germany, both of which right now are emasculated.”Barnier’s draft budget had sought to cut the fiscal deficit from a projected 6% of national output this year to 5% in 2025. Voting down his government would be catastrophic for state finances, he had said.Le Pen shrugged off the warning. She said her party would support any eventual emergency law that rolls over the 2024 budget’s tax-and-spend provisions into next year to ensure there is stopgap financing. \nOn Thursday the weather is forecast to be partly cloudy in the hilly areas of Koshi and Gandaki Province.

The first encounter at 9:15 am sees the Pokhara Avengers battling the Janakpur Bolts, followed by an exciting clash between Kathmandu Gurkhas and Sudurpaschim Royals at 1:15 pm.The Pokhara Avengers, led by marquee player Kushal Bhurtel, are yet to secure a win, having lost their only match so far. With a squad featuring talents like Sagar Dhakal and foreign stars such as Bas de Leede and Raymon Reifer, the team will be eager to turn their fortunes around under the guidance of coach Rajeev Kumar.The Janakpur Bolts, conversely, are on a roll, winning both their matches to sit comfortably with 4 points. Led by captain Anil Sah, with marquee player Aasif Sheikh and international stars like James Neesham and Ben Mike, the Bolts, coached by Pubudu Dassanayake, look formidable contenders. In the second match, the Kathmandu Gurkhas, captained by marquee player Karan KC, face the Sudurpaschim Royals, led by Dipendra Singh Airee. Both teams have 2 points from two matches with one win and one loss each when.The Gurkhas have key players such as Bhim Sharki and international talents like Stevie Eskinazi and Gerhard Erasmus to make an impact. On the other hand, the Royals, featuring players like Abinash Bohara and Rohan Mustafa, aim to establish dominance with strategic gameplay under coach Jagat Tamata.Thursday’s matches are expected to play a crucial role in shaping the league standings as teams fight for a spot in the playoffs. \nNepal and China have officially signed the BRI Cooperation Framework during Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli’s visit to China. This development formally further advances Nepal’s involvement in the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), a programme China proposed and Nepal initially signed in 2017.The signing was delayed on Tuesday due to disagreements over terminology to be used in the draft. The debate centred on whether to include the term “grant” in the financial cooperation modality. Following further discussions, a consensus was reached on Wednesday, with both sides agreeing to use the term “aid assistance financing.”A senior Nepali official involved in the talks said that discussions have finally concluded leading to an agreement on the framework. Initially, the Nepali side proposed ‘grant financing cooperation modality,’ which was amended by the Chinese to ‘assistant financing modality.’ Eventually, the term ‘aid assistance financing’ was agreed upon by both parties.”On Nepal’s side, the negotiations were led by Prime Minister Oli’s economic and development advisor Yubaraj Khatiwada and Foreign Minister Arzu Rana Deuba. High-ranking officials from China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs represented the Chinese delegation.This agreement marks a significant step in Nepal-China relations, paving the way for enhanced economic cooperation under the framework of the BRI, a major programme introduced by Chinese President Xi Jinping. \nLumbini Lions posted a formidable target of 192 runs for Biratnagar Kings in their first match of the Nepal Premier League (NPL) on Wednesday at the Tribhuvan University Cricket Ground, Kirtipur.Batting first after losing the toss, Lumbini scored 191 runs for the loss of seven wickets in the allotted 20 overs. This is the highest team total in the tournament so far, surpassing Sudurpaschim’s 182 runs against Biratnagar on Tuesday.Captain Rohit Paudel led the charge with 46 runs off 29 balls, hitting four boundaries and two sixes. Openers Ashutosh Ghirohiya and Arjun Saud contributed 15 and 17 runs, respectively. Tom Moores, who struck three consecutive sixes off Anil Kharel, scored 30 runs off 17 balls before being run out.Four of Lumbini’s batsmen were run out, including Sundeep Jora (12) and Ben Cutting (6). Vivek Yadav provided fireworks in the final over, smashing two sixes off the first two balls bowled by Basir Ahmed, ending with an unbeaten 19 runs off seven balls.For Biratnagar, Ismatullah Alam, Rajesh Pulami, and Sandeep Lamichhane each claimed a wicket.The match puts Biratnagar Kings under pressure as they have already lost their first two games. \nDuring monsoon last year, the Chandannath Municipality of Jumla district reported several cases of dengue. The local unit has reported cases of infection from the deadly virus this year too.Although most cases were locally transmitted, health workers in the district don’t consider the virus spread a serious public health problem. This is because Jumla is among the coldest places in the country, with temperatures dipping to subzero levels in the winter.Studies, however, show a disturbing development.“My study shows the presence of Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes and their larvae in Chandannath Municipality,” said Buddhi Ram Oli, a PhD scholar at the Central Department of Zoology of the Tribhuvan University. “Chandannath Municipality is located at an elevation of 2,438 metres, and this is the first time that dengue virus-spreading mosquitoes and their larvae have been found at such a high altitude.”Earlier, vectors spreading the deadly disease were recorded only up to 2,100 metres.Local residents and health officials serving in Jumla are aware of the presence of vectors spreading deadly diseases and growing number of infections. But they don’t take the issue seriously, thinking that the vectors cannot survive long due to the climatic conditions of the region.“We once met officials at District Health Office Jumla and discussed launching an awareness drive and destroying breeding sites of mosquitoes,” said Chhatra Bahadur Mahat, health coordinator at the Chandannath Municipality. “But neither does the health office provide a budget for such programmes nor does the local unit allocate any funds. So we couldn’t do anything.”Along with Jumla, all districts across the country have recorded dengue infections this year.Oli, who carried out vector surveillance, said that, as in Chandannath Municipality, health workers at other local units too have not taken the risk of the virus-spread seriously.Experts say the country’s health workers and health facilities are ill prepared to cope with the emerging public health challenges brought about by climate change. Several health facilities were overwhelmed with dengue patients this year, too. Due to a lack of beds, patients were forced to sleep in corridors, on the floor, on chairs, in storerooms, and out in the hospital compound. Hospitals even lacked basic supplies like IV stands, and patients’ visitors had to hold the IV bags or health workers had to improvise by tying them to windows.Experts say the deadly virus outbreak in most mountain districts and all hill districts shows the impact of climate change on Nepal’s healthcare system. Despite these challenges, no effective mitigation measures have been adopted.Many hospitals are overwhelmed with an influx of patients, and health workers are forced to place seriously ill patients in corridors and other makeshift spaces, compromising patient safety.“Our health facilities are not equipped to endure the climate crisis,” said Dr Meghnath Dhimal, chief researcher at the Nepal Health Research Council. “Many are built on hilltops or riverbanks and are vulnerable to climate impacts. These health facilities are also unprepared for emerging problems and surges in patient flow.”Experts say climate change, along with some other factors, such as increased mobility and improved transportation, has been contributing to the spread of deadly diseases in places considered no-risk zones in the past.“The rise in the temperature caused by climate change provides a conducive environment for dengue vectors to thrive and spread in the mountainous areas,” said Dhimal. “Risks posed by climatic factors cannot be ignored or underestimated.”A report by the United Nations titled ‘Climate Change 2022: Impacts, Adaptation and Vulnerability’ states that at least six major vector-borne diseases have recently emerged in Nepal and are now considered endemic, with climate change implicated as the primary driver.The report also showed increasing evidence that climate change has extended the elevational distribution of Anopheles, Culex and Aedes mosquitoes, which carry viruses to above 2,000 metres in Nepal.Dengue is a viral disease transmitted by female Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes. According to the World Health Organisation, the same vector also transmits chikungunya, yellow fever, and the Zika virus.So far, 12 people have died due to dengue and over 29,000 have been infected since the start of 2024 if the government data is to be believed. Experts say reported dengue cases may only represent a small fraction of the true scale of the outbreak, as around 90 percent of the infected people do not show any symptoms and health authorities often conceal the actual number of deaths and infections.This year, districts in Tarai region reported fewer cases of dengue infection than districts in the hills and mountains. Experts attribute this to the residents of Tarai’s becoming more aware of the deadly virus and taking preventive measures. High temperatures (above 35 degrees Celsius) could also have contributed to less infection, as mosquito vectors do not survive above 35 degrees Celsius.Over the past few years, dengue has become a year-round threat in Nepal, with cases consistently on the rise. \nManufacturers and exporters say they are in a dilemma over trade with India following the restrictive measures imposed by New Delhi on Nepali goods. Making matters worse is the Nepali government’s silence even though the goods have not been sold to India for months.Dol Raj Adhikari, president of the Nepal Sanitary and Diaper Association, said sanitary pads and diapers worth of Rs250 million had been stranded in the warehouses for the past three months.“We completed all the processes to acquire the Bureau of Indian Standards [BIS] certificate to export our products, but no team from India is coming to inspect the factory. We even wrote to the Indian authority multiple times but our requests have fallen on deaf ears.”As per the provision, once the Indian inspection team gives a green signal after factory inspection, goods can be exported to India.In 2020, the Indian government asked the BIS to prescribe mandatory standards for imported goods in line with international quality norms. The move aimed to prevent Chinese goods from entering India from any of its neighbours.After the suppression of Chinese apps, the Indian government imposed import restrictions on more than 370 Chinese products. Insiders say India does not want any products from Nepal that have Chinese components, including Nepal’s hydroelectricity, greatly worrying Nepal’s top exporters.The BIS deals with the marking and certifying of goods, incorporating quality standards and information on international norms to be followed while importing.The rules worry Adhikari, who owns the AG Health Industries Private Limited that produces sanitary pads and diapers in Bhairahawa. “India seems intent to halt imports from Nepal,” said Adhikari. According to the association, Nepal used to export three truckloads of sanitary pads and diapers daily. There are 29 sanitary pads and diaper factories in Nepal, both large and small, employing 6,000 workers.Sanitary pads and diaper factories used to operate 12 hours a day when the demand boomed, but due to the export obstacles, factories have reduced operating hours by 4 hours, said Adhikari.According to the Department of Customs, Nepal exported 201.99 million pieces of sanitary pads and diapers worth Rs719 million to India in the last fiscal year, ending mid-July.Likewise, a big consignment of Goldstar shoes failed to get export clearance after India refused to issue the BIS certificate, putting Nepal’s homegrown shoemaker on the brink.Exporters said there were rumours on Friday that India had extended the deadline to obtain a BIS certificate, and the Nepali exporters were allowed to export goods with their existing certificates.“But we have not received any formal notice from the Indian authority on the time extension of the BIS certificate,” said Baburam Adhikari, spokesperson for the Ministry of Industry, Commerce and Supplies. “If the BIS had made such a decision, we would have been informed.”“Neither the BIS India nor the domestic industries has confirmed or communicated with us on the issue.”After Nepali exports were halted over the BIS issue, the industry ministry has written multiple times to its Indian counterpart. Meetings were held, and the issue was forwarded even during Industry Minister Damodar Bhandari’s visit to India in August. “However, there is no progress,” said Adhikari. Adhikari said none of the Nepali exporters who applied for the BIS certificate have gotten it till now.“The BIS certificate issue has put the industries in Rupandehi in a big dilemma. They were opened to export goods to India,” said Thakur Kumar Shrestha, president of the Siddhartha Chamber of Commerce and Industry. It has negatively impacted both the industries and Nepal’s trade.Shrestha said factories are either running at half capacity or getting shut down, and workers are being laid off. Exports from the cement makers in Rupandehi—such as Arghakhanchi Cement, Sarbottam Cement, Palpa Cement, and Balaji Cement—have completely stopped for nearly two months.“Even as the domestic consumption of cement declined, production was not impacted due to the huge demand from India. But now cement plants in Rupandehi are on the verge of shutting down or running under-capacity,” said Shrestha.Except plywood, the export of all the listed goods that require a BIS certificate has come to a halt, said Shrestha. “India has neither renewed the certificate nor provided a new one.”Goods under the BIS with compulsory certification are any variety of cement manufactured or sold in India, steel and iron products, chemicals, fertiliser, polymers and textiles, cables, flat transparent sheet glass, cattle feed, footwear, centrifugally cast (spun) iron pipes, jute bags, viscose staple fibres, geo textiles, portable water bottles, plywood, and wooden flush door shutters, among others.“Plywood is currently not restricted. But despite having already paid the BIS charges and completed the process, the inspection team from India has not provided a BIS certificate for Nepali goods,” said Hom Prasad Ghimire, president of the Nepal Plywood Manufacturers Association. Ghimire said that his company completed the process of getting the BIS certificate in June. He said the Nepali plywood is of better quality than the Indian plywood.Plywood has been given until March 2025 for certification-free export. He said that out of 80 plywood factories, 52 have even deposited charges to obtain the certificate. The plywood industry employs 25,000 workers across the country.According to the association, Nepal exported Rs8 billion worth of plywood to India. The volume could have increased had the exports not been interrupted.Trade with India has been repeatedly obstructed. Experts say there is a need to seek long-term solutions for uninterrupted trade with the southern neighbour. “There must be a mutual recognition agreement on select exportable items. Under such an agreement, exportable goods certified by the government will be recognised by the Indian government. This would be the best long-term solution for standard certification,” said Posh Raj Pandey, chairman of the South Asia Watch of Economics, Environment and Trade.Under the 2009 bilateral trade agreement with Nepal, India agreed to support the setting up of standard-purpose labs, said Pandey. However, Nepal has not been able to push for the labs during talks with India— even after 15 years of the agreement. He said lack of coordination among government agencies and frequent changes of bureaucrats have put the issue on the back burner. \nThe US has just concluded our generation's most eagerly watched presidential elections. Donald J Trump has won the White House resoundingly, and in addition, the Republican Party, also known as the Grand Old Party, has now wrested control of the Senate and has a comfortable majority in Congress. Simply put, Trump and the GOP now have complete control of the executive and legislative branches of the government, which will embolden the new Trump administration to pursue policies with determination. The world is closely watching how the Trump administration will usher in a new foreign policy paradigm that revolves around Trump’s “America First” philosophy. Foreign policy mandarins across the globe have mixed feelings about Trump's victory: Allies in Europe are gripped with anxiety, whereas in South Asia, there is a sense that since the rhetoric of Trump’s election campaign focused on combating China, Asia is on the cusp of witnessing unprecedented American engagement. It is in this context of American outreach in Asia that South Asia will play a pivotal role in shaping outcomes of a constantly evolving new world order. Nepal must remain steadfast in keeping up with developments of the great power games whilst constantly safeguarding and pursuing its interests independently. The heart of the US’s contention with China revolves around two critical issues: Trade and technology. The Covid-19 pandemic demonstrated to the world how global trade supply chains depended on supply lines in China. With the resurgence of the America First policy, the Trump administration is determined to impose new trade tariffs of up to 60 percent on Chinese exports. While the supposed new tariffs are likely to come into play in the second half of 2025, there is palpable fear that new trade tariffs could bring in disruptions to global trade as costs are likely to increase in the coming days. The Trump administration is determined to create new jobs to revitalise the economy by incentivising manufacturing in the country. Whilst Trump's plan to re-establish the US as a manufacturing hub is seen as a patriotic move, could higher labour costs in a developed country contribute towards lower production costs? The US’s trade conflict with China presents other developing nations in Asia with a unique opportunity to attract investments in the manufacturing industry. Although it is outlandish to suggest China will be entirely substituted as a manufacturing hub, the emergence of new manufacturing opportunities in the global south presents the US with the opportunity to fuel economic growth essential for the sustenance of democracy. South Asia gives the US a unique avenue for enhanced collaboration. With a democratic polity spread across most of South Asia’s landmass, job creation and energy production are the key elements for stability in the region. The Indo-Gangetic delta is among the most populous regions in the world and possesses the human capital to fuel economic growth across South Asia. Although the Civilian Nuclear Deal between India and the US is a milestone agreement for the use of clean nuclear energy to generate electricity in India, the nuclear plants in India only contribute 3.11 percent of the total electricity generated in India. For India to meet the energy requirements to set up a large-scale industrial base, access to high-quality uninterrupted energy will be critical for industrialisation in India and across South Asia. The Millennium Challenge Corporation pact signed between Nepal and the US is a significant breakthrough in Nepal’s energy sector, as American investment in upgrading transmission line infrastructure is greatly required to transport high-quality, uninterrupted energy.Nepal still requires robust investment in the transmission side to feed supply lines across South Asia. The fact that Nepal, Bangladesh and India have signed a power trade agreement demonstrates the potential of Nepal’s energy sector in fuelling energy to propel economic growth in the region. South Asia missed the industrial flight back in the decades of the 80s and the 90s; it’s time the region reaped the benefits of the US capital that could trigger a wave of industrialisation. Another focal point of tension between the US and China is the issue of semiconductors. The US would want to retain the technological leadership of high-end chips in the hands of its allies, namely Taiwan, South Korea and the Netherlands. Currently, the world relies solely on Taiwan and its crown jewel, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (TSMC), for high-end chips—TSMC has a market share of 90 percent of advanced chip manufacturing. Both the US and China know the strategic advantage one can gain by accessing high-end chips, which is critical for next-generation AI modelling in sectors such as defence, intelligence, telecom, medicine and aerospace. The ability to store big data also depends on the quality and the advanced functioning of high-end chips. In simple words, the US’s ability to retain control and contain access to high-end chips to compete whilst diversifying the production of low-end chips will provide the US and its allies the political leverage it desperately wants. The tech industry in South Asia has been recognised as a force to reckon with, particularly in India and the periphery of Bangladesh. Sri Lanka seems to have made progress, while Nepal also aspires to expand its tech business reach. Cross-border payments, the expansion of data centres and the use of technology in the delivery of governance are areas of expansive collaboration. India’s ability to produce low-end chips in the future is also critical to expanding the tech industry in South Asia, as indigenously produced chips can help reduce manufacturing costs and the tech industry’s dependency on accessing chips elsewhere, which are always in high demand globally. But there are also areas of concern for South Asia regarding Trump’s ascendency to the White House. Trump has vowed to pull out of the Paris Climate Agreement and climate change is an issue that confronts South Asia, particularly Nepal. Nepal has witnessed firsthand the impacts of climate change and, therefore, the country and South Asia at large cannot afford to ignore the impact of climate change. This issue cannot become secondary for either Nepal or the region. Climate change challenges the livelihoods of our people, and the Government of Nepal must voice its concern visibly and work towards creating strategic alliances that will compel the new US administration to rethink walking away from Paris Climate Agreement. The new US administration and its South Asian partners must work on issues impacting human welfare to achieve wider social and economic participation in the democratic process in the region. Trump’s vision of America First is virtuous, but to restore the US’s trust globally, he must take its allies into confidence.  \nHow big will the impact be as Nepal’s major international airport closes for ten hours starting Friday?Economists say it’s too early to quantify, but the losses for the Nepali economy will be huge.Nepal’s economic momentum has slowed down since the late September floods, and the government’s decision to close the key airport could stifle growth.“It will be a big setback for the country’s ailing economy as it will hit tourism and business activities, including transport, hotels, restaurants, telecommunication and other sectors,” said Bishwambhar Pyakurel, a noted economist. Pyakurel called it a deliberate “restriction” imposed by the government, despite it having many alternatives to carry out construction at the airport.Tickets prices are soaring, with most destinations, including Nepal’s labour markets, witnessing a fourfold price rise due to a widening gap between supply and demand.A notice to airmen, popularly known as NOTAM, issued by the Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal, states that the airport will be closed from 10pm to 8am from Friday for five months, until March 31, to expand the taxiways. The airport is currently closed from 2am to 6am. Two parallel taxiway projects are ongoing at the Tribhuvan International Airport in Kathmandu. The extension of the parallel taxiway was initially planned in 2009.Travel trade entrepreneurs said the civil aviation body’s mismanagement could shave off at least Rs50 billion in airline and tourism industry revenues, even as the government struggles with revenue generation.The outlooks for 2024-2025 of the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank, and the International Monetary Fund forecast economic recovery on the basis of improved tourist arrivals in Nepal. Growth in food, transport, and accommodation sectors have been better than expected even as other economic indicators lag.In September, the Asian Development Bank revised Nepal’s economic growth forecast upward to 4.9 percent for the current fiscal year beginning mid-July, based on projected agricultural and electricity output growth and buoyant tourist arrivals.The National Statistics Office’s annual account estimated that accommodation and food service activities, which are linked to tourism, would see a robust growth of 21.84 percent, the highest among 18 economic compositions in the Nepali economy, in the last fiscal year ended mid-July.According to the respective ministries, the late monsoon floods and landslides affected agriculture and electricity output, and now tourism has received a big jolt.It will be more painful for domestic airlines as winter will bring more fog and pollution, curtailing flight frequencies.“It’s an unplanned construction,” said Pyakurel. “Today, time is money. For trading, business and leisure, coming to Nepal will be a big challenge,” he said, adding that the airfares are so high that tourists and businessmen will think twice before flying. Hoteliers say that due to high ticket prices, key events planned in Kathmandu have either been postponed or cancelled.As part of the improvement plan, a 1,140-metre-long parallel taxiway is being built on the runway’s southern side, or the Koteshwar end. This will connect the existing international apron to the end of runway 02.Similarly, another 450-metre-long parallel taxiway is being built at the northern end of the runway.Considering the planned infrastructure, the maximum runway capacity will see 42 aircraft movements per hour in mixed-mode operation, enabling 187,000 aircraft movements per year from the 128,449 flight movements last year. In 2023, the Kathmandu airport recorded 8.7 million passengers—4.54 million international air travellers and 4.15 million domestic ones, according to statistics of the Tribhuvan International Airport.Similarly, in terms of flight movement, the airport handled 128,449 flight movements—31,460 flights by international airlines and 96,989 by domestic carriers.Travel trade entrepreneurs say the ill-planned construction would take way too long, extending until another peak tourism season in spring (March).“These will be painful months for travel trade entrepreneurs as the plan is being implemented in the peak tourism season. We, however, cannot oppose the airport’s infrastructure development,” said Sagar Pandey, president of the Trekking Agencies Association of Nepal.“On different occasions, we have suggested that the government and the civil aviation body find alternatives to such a long closure, such as incentivising airlines to fly from Bhairahawa and Pokhara international airports.”However, international airlines are hesitant to connect to the new airports, which have remained idle for months due to the technical and financial issues of flying to them.Pandey said they might lose at least 40 percent of trekkers this year considering the flight cancellations.Nepal Tourism Board has revised its 2024 tourist arrival forecast to 1.1 million from the projected 1.3 million. As of October, Nepal has received 900,000 tourists.Some entrepreneurs say that five hours of construction time, as it used to be, was appropriate, but insiders suspect that a 10-hour closure would force many airlines to divert to Bhairahawa. For instance, on October 27, the Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal (CAAN) took action against a Thai AirAsia flight, refusing to allow it to land at Kathmandu airport.Media reports show that the flight was later permitted. However, after the plane landed, authorities temporarily suspended the airline and its general sales agent. Later the restrictions were lifted on the “condition” that the airline would fly from Bhairahawa as well. Airline officials say the “punitive measure” was not the aviation regulator’s first action. On October 30, 2022, the CAAN cancelled Nepal Airlines’ scheduled flight to Delhi as punishment for defying instructions to move some of its international services to the newly-built Bhairahawa airport.Nepal Airlines’ jet remained on the ground, and more than 500 passengers were affected by the last-minute cancellation.“I would like to seriously draw the attention of the government that Tribhuvan International Airport is being closed for 10 hours daily from November 8 to March 31. It cannot be considered normal to close an international airport for 10 hours to build structures. Earlier, during the rehabilitation of the main runway, the airport was closed only for 5/7 hours at night,” lawmaker Udaya Shumsher Rana wrote on X on October 29.“It is clear that closing the Kathmandu airport means diverting flights to Pokhara and Bhairahawa to show that those two airports are fine. There are technical reasons behind international airlines not being ready to fly to these two airports. Undoubtedly, the Civil Aviation Authority leadership is trying to hide its weaknesses by closing the Kathmandu airport for 10 hours.”Rana argued that if this decision is not revised, Nepal’s global image and tourism business would suffer. The airport closure will also hit domestic flights. Buddha Air, Nepal’s largest domestic carrier, currently operates 180 daily flights. As the airline must reduce its flights to 135, there will be a substantial drop in its revenue and government’s taxes. Some other domestic airlines have complained to the regulator that flight allocation is not proportionate under the new arrangement. \n\n\nNepal-India relations amidst the 2015 constitution promulgation, blockade, and regional geopolitics are discussed, along with India's perceptions of Nepali communist parties and its evolving neighbourhood policy.\nKunwar, former Amazon employee, leads Daraz Nepal as MD, discussing e-commerce opportunities and challenges in Nepal's business environment.\nAn arrest warrant is issued against Rastriya Swatantra Party President Rabi Lamichhane and 13 others for cooperative fraud in various districts, leading to investigations and street protests by his supporters.\nA dispute between the House Speaker and the Janamat Party over the removal of a party lawmaker, Goma Labh Sapkota, has escalated, sparking accusations of criminality and racism, with the parliament secretariat defending the Speaker's decision.\nDespite RPP leader Rajendra Lingden's prediction of electoral success, the party failed to win any of the 41 local level posts in recent by-elections, prompting internal criticism and questions about his leadership.\nNepali Congress wins the most seats in local by-elections, but loses some previously held positions to CPN-UML and CPN (Maoist Centre), while RSP and NMKP emerge as new players at the local level.\nNepal's Prime Minister Oli, during his official visit to China, met with Chinese leaders, signed project agreements, and discussed Belt and Road Initiative cooperation and economic assistance.\nThe Nepal Election Commission is holding local level by-elections for 41 vacant positions on Sunday.

The commission has said that the count can be followed on its website.The commission plans to announce the final by-election results within two days.“We expect to use a helicopter to collect ballot boxes of Gaurishankar Rural Municipality of Dolakha due to the difficult geography of the village,” Durga Prasad Chalise, the deputy spokesperson for the commission said.“It may take some time to collect ballot boxes in Sarkegad Rural Municipality of Humla and Swamikartik Khapar Rural Municipality of Bajura, but other than that, we will have no problem starting vote counting immediately.”The commission is holding by-elections as per the legal provision. According to the Local Level Election Act-2017, if the position of the district coordination committee chief, deputy chief, rural municipality chairman, vice-chairman, municipality mayor, deputy mayor and ward chair fall vacant for any reason before the end of their term and if more than a year of their term remains, the remaining term will be filled through a by-election.The elections are being held only to elect 41 representatives at local units but political parties have given priority to the by-polls as if it is going to be a test of their strength.Even top politicians such as CPN (Maoist Centre) chair Pushpa Kamal Dahal, Nepali Congress general secretaries Gagan Thapa and Bishwa Prakash Sharma and CPN-UML General Secretary Shankar Pokharel, among other influential leaders, were actively involved in election campaigns in favour of their candidates.Some reckon people could express their disenchantment towards traditional parties because of their inability to deliver on governance. But Uddhab Pyakurel, an assistant professor at the Kathmandu University, said the by-elections can’t be seen as a voice of the Nepali people at large.Pyakurel thinks that regular elections are different to by-elections and by-elections results seldom reflect on future election results.Sunday’s by-elections are taking place only for the 41 posts of certain local units. There are 753 local units (276 municipalities and 460 rural municipalities), further divided into 6,743 wards.“So the results of the 41 local contests are insufficient to draw definite conclusions about the future,” Pyakurel said. It could be an indicator to analyse anti-incumbency if the parties lose the seats that they had won earlier, he added. “However, the results themselves cannot be considered a solid basis to gauge the future poll performance of political parties.”Out of the 44 seats for which by-elections are being held on Sunday, 30 were won by the Congress in the earlier local polls while seven seats each were won by the UML and the Maoist Centre. \nNepali Congress candidate Krishnaman Dangol has been elected mayor of Kirtipur Municipality in the by-election held on Sunday. Dangol secured 5,334 votes, defeating his closest rival, Shivsharan Maharjan of the Maoist Centre, by 779 votes.Maharjan received 4,555 votes, while Surendra Manandhar of the CPN-UML garnered 4,337 votes.The by-election was held following the demise of former mayor Rajkumar Nakarmi, who passed away on July 26 last year due to a kidney-related illness. Nakarmi, also from the Congress, was elected Mayor in the 2022 local elections.Kirtipur, historically known as a left-leaning stronghold, saw a shift in political dynamics with Nakarmi’s victory in 2022. Kirtipur was declared a municipality in 1997. \nKrishnaman Dangol of the Nepali Congress has maintained a lead in the ongoing vote count for the mayor of Kirtipur Municipality. As of the latest tally, Dangol has garnered 789 votes, while Surendra Manandhar of the CPN-UML trails with 666 votes. Shivsharan Maharjan of the CPN (Maoist Centre) has received 465 votes. Among independent candidates, Rajman Maharjan has secured 418 votes, Dinesh Kumar Adhikari 236, and Kabikumar Maharjan 58. Rastriya Prajatantra Party’s Dhruba Maharjan has obtained 119 votes, while Bhanu Rijal of the CPN (Unified Socialist) has 22 votes.   \nRojina Shrestha of the Rastriya Swatantra Party has been elected ward chair of Kathmandu Metropolitan City-16, securing 2,902 votes.According to the Election Commission, Laxmiratna Tuladhar of the UML came second with 2,220 votes, while Congress candidate Devendra Pathak finished third with 2,214 votes. Unified Socialist’s Min Bahadur Manandhar received 1,092 votes, and Shyam Krishna Shrestha of the Rastriya Prajatantra Party secured 774 votes. A total of 10,558 votes were cast, with 180 declared invalid. The by-election was held following the death of Mukunda Rijal, elected ward chair in 2022 with 4,018 votes from Congress. \nA man accused of threatening Nepali businesspersons by claiming to be a member of the Indian criminal gang Lawrence Bishnoi, has been arrested. The arrested is Harichandra Phuyal alias Navin Pradhan, 36, a resident of Panchthar, and currently residing in ward 13 of Mechinagar Municipality, Jhapa.According to police, Phuyal used Indian phone numbers to make calls and send messages to businesspersons, claiming to represent the gang. He allegedly terrorised them by demanding they apologise to controversial medical entrepreneur Durga Prasai, warning of dire consequences, including threats to their lives. The Central Investigation Bureau (CIB) apprehended Pradhan in Charaali, Jhapa, on Wednesday evening. Police investigations revealed that Pradhan acted under Prasai’s instructions. Authorities said Pradhan has a history of criminal involvement and was previously on the run. Two mobile phones were seized during the arrest, and further investigation is ongoing.  \nPolice have arrested two individuals on charges of fraudulently promising foreign employment.A police team from the Kathmandu Valley Crime Investigation Office arrested 39-year-old Suvarna Kumar Bal of Bakaiya Rural Municipality-5 in Makwanpur and 28-year-old Manisha Kumari of Brahmapuri Rural Municipality-3 in Sarlahi.According to the complaints with the police, Suvarna had promised to send one individual to Croatia, collecting Rs1.5 million, while Manisha had promised to send another person to Dubai, collecting Rs245,000. Both individuals went into hiding after taking the money.Suvarna was arrested from Bafal on Monday, and Manisha was apprehended from Gongabu Bus Park area, Kathmandu on Tuesday. They have been sent to the Department of Foreign Employment in Tahachal for further investigation and action. \nThe Asian Development Bank (ADB) launched a photo exhibition to celebrate over five decades of partnership with Nepal in the energy sector—a collaboration that has been instrumental in driving the country’s development and energy transformation.State Minister for Energy, Water Resources and Irrigation Purna Bahadur Tamang and ADB Country Director for Nepal Arnaud Cauchois inaugurated the exhibition. “We take immense pride in our role as one of the key partners in Nepal’s clean energy transformation,” said Cauchois. “Our collaboration with the Government of Nepal and other development partners has led to significant improvements in electrification, enhancing the quality of life of Nepalis across the country.”The partnership between ADB and Nepal began in 1972 with the funding for a transmission line project. Since then, ADB has played a critical role in its energy sector, supporting hydroelectric power generation, nearly half of the country’s transmission lines, and over one-third of its 33-kilovolt distribution substations. This has enabled Nepal to generate more clean energy than ever before, meeting growing power demands, improving energy security, and setting the stage for surplus power exports.In this partnership of over 50 years, ADB has achieved many firsts in Nepal’s energy sector. ADB supported landmark projects such as the 60-megawatt Khimti hydropower plant, Nepal’s first large public-private sector investment, and the 144-megawatt Kali Gandaki “A” hydropower project, which have been pivotal in boosting energy production. Current focus areas include storage projects, like the 140-megawatt Tanahu hydropower project, and the diversification of renewable energy sources, such as solar photovoltaic systems and rural microgrids, ensuring clean energy access for all.ADB has also supported reforms in the Nepal Electricity Authority to improve operational performance and efficiency. Beyond infrastructure development, ADB recognises that gender equality and social inclusion are integral to achieving sustainable energy for all.“ADB will continue to support the Government of Nepal and work with development partners to strengthen further the energy sector and support Nepal's energy transition by promoting clean energy, climate adaptation, and a sustainable business model that attracts diverse investments, including private sector financing,” said Cauchois.A week-long special photo exhibition, organised in collaboration with the Photojournalists Club of Nepal, will be held at the Nepal Art Council in Kathmandu from Tuesday and in Janakpur from December 12-18. \nNepali officials were paid $2.5 million in bribes to seal the contract for the $209.6-million Airbus deal, the largest in Nepal’s aviation history, charging documents filed in the US court show.Deepak Sharma, a former executive of the US-based aviation services provider AAR, pleaded guilty in July earlier this year to conspiracy to violate the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) anti-bribery provisions. The charges were based on allegations that Sharma was part of a conspiracy to bribe Nepali officials to secure two Airbus A330 deals in 2017.Sharma pleaded guilty and agreed to forfeit around $130,000. His sentences are yet to be determined, so this case is ongoing.Sharma, a Nepal-born British citizen, joined AAR in 2015. Before this, he was the chief technical officer at AJW Group, which he joined in 2008. He has also been the engineering director at UK International Airlines.According to the documents in this case obtained by the Post, between November 2015 and August 2018, Sharma conspired with others to pay bribes to Nepali officials to win a bid to sell two Airbus A330-200 aircraft on behalf of AAR Corp to Nepal Airlines Corporation.On June 24, 2024, the US Department of Justice alleged that Sharma—as an agent for AAR—conspired to bribe Nepali officials and filed a single count of information under seal in the District of Columbia, alleging a conspiracy to violate the FCPA’s anti-bribery provisions.In July, guilty pleas were publicly revealed, five years after AAR disclosed possible FCPA violations. The court unsealed the case on August 1, 2024, in connection with a plea agreement.In December 2016, Nepal Airlines selected a group consisting of AAR Corp, German Aviation Capital, and Hi Fly (airline) of Portugal to purchase two widebody aircraft. The month before, according to the investigation transcript, Sharma sent a text message to a conspirator, stating: “I am having dinner with the head of the evaluation committee now. We are discussing how to throw others out even if they come below our bid. See you tomorrow.”In an Information filed, the US Department of Justice alleged that Sharma, on behalf of AAR, agreed to bribe Nepali officials to manipulate the deal in favour of AAR and a German aircraft leasing and trading company, working with a Nepali intermediary and an unnamed co-conspirator [a director of an affiliate of the German company] to facilitate a sham transaction between the German aircraft company and Nepal Airlines.The Information describes Sharma’s email and text communications, as well as invoices and wire transfer records, which record payments made by the German company's Ireland-based Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) to a United Arab Emirates-based bank account used by the Nepali intermediary to fund bribes to Nepali officials. In Nepal, on April 4, the Commission for Investigation of Abuse of Authority (CIAA), the constitutional anti-graft body, completed its five-year probe into the Airbus deal, concluding that procuring two wide-body Airbus A330 jets caused a loss of Rs1.47 billion ($13.38 million) to the government.The loss was computed based on the exchange rate at the time of the last instalment payment in 2018.The CIAA filed a case against 32 individuals at the Special Court for their alleged corruption in the deal, commonly known as the ‘wide-body scam’. The court is expected to issue a verdict within this month.The first of the two wide-body aircraft, Annapurna, arrived at the Tribhuvan International Airport in June 2018. The second, Makalu, came a month later.In a statement, the commission said it had filed the case against a former minister, high-level sitting and retired government officials, private sector representatives, and aircraft suppliers.The accused are former tourism minister Jeevan Bahadur Shahi, former managing director of Nepal Airlines Sugat Ratna Kansakar, former tourism secretary Shankar Adhikari and former finance secretary Shishir Kumar Dhungana.At the time of the deal, Adhikari and Dhungana were on the board of the national flag carrier.In charging documents filed in the US court, Sharma is described as an “agent” of Company 1 (a reference to AAR).“It was the purpose of the conspiracy for Sharma and his co-conspirators to illegally benefit Company 1, Subsidiary 1 [a wholly-owned subsidiary of Company 1], and others by bribing Nepali officials, including Foreign Official 1 [a Nepali citizen who served as a high-level official at Nepal Airlines Corporation from at least approximately 2015 through 2019] in order to win a bid to sell two Airbus A330-200 aircraft to the state-owned national carrier.”Sharma and his co-conspirators made and received wire transfers intended, in part, as bribes for Nepali officials in connection with Nepal Airlines Corporation transactions, using bank accounts in the United States, Ireland, and the United Arab Emirates, among other places.Sharma and his co-conspirators attempted to disguise the wire transfers as legitimate business transactions by entering into sham agreements between Subsidiary 2 [a wholly-owned subsidiary of Company 1], Company 2 [an aircraft leasing and trading company based in Germany], and Company 3 [a special purpose vehicle incorporated in Ireland and managed by Company 2] on the one hand, and Companies 4 [a Hong Kong incorporated company used by Intermediary] and 5 [a United Arab Emirates incorporated company used by Intermediary] on the other. Some payments were made under sham invoices sent by Sharma and his co-conspirators from Companies 4 and 5 and directed to Company 3. The invoices falsely referred to the bribe payments as “advances”.“In total, between in or around May and August 2018, Company 3 paid Company 5 the equivalent of approximately $2,500,000 in connection with Nepal Airlines transaction, a portion of which Sharma understood would be distributed as bribes to Nepali officials, including Foreign Official 1.”On or about March 29, 2016, approximately six months before Nepal Airlines publicly issued a Request for Proposal (RFP) for the purchase of two A330s, Sharma forwarded an email to two executives at Company 1 containing a draft RFP that was circulated among Nepal Airlines Corporation officials, including Foreign Official 1. In his email to the two executives at Company 1, Sharma stated, “Please find attached Draft RFP[.] NOTE: [T]his [is] not published yet, and it is strictly for three of us [a Company 1 executive], you and I, to comment and change any terms to suit [Company 1]. Let me know if you want any changes made to the payment terms or bid terms so that it favours [Company 1]. I can ask these to be incorporated [sic] into the RFP for publication. I am meeting with the [Foreign Official 1] and Chairman this week…”On or about September 1, 2016, approximately one month before Nepal Airlines Corporation publicly issued the RFP, Foreign Official 1 sent an email to Sharma, writing, “What I have in mind is that we will specify MOU signing date, purchase agreement date and delivery date in such a way that [a competitor of Company 1] cannot meet delivery dates.“Following are tentative dates, and I want your feedback on whether you can meet delivery dates… Tentative dates I fixed but not yet shared with other Nepal Airlines executives…”On October 30, 2016, Foreign Official 1 texted Sharma, “[N]o need to worry at all. Almost all higher-ups are in our pocket.”On May 15, 2018, Sharma sent Individual 1 a text message about Intermediary and Foreign Official 1 pressuring to pay Company 5’s invoice, writing, “The Nepali guys is [sic] chasing like hell.”On May 17, 2018, Sharma sent an email to Individual 1 with an attached invoice from Company 5 to Company 3 for $450,000 for “Service Provided for Bid and Sale of X2A330 as an Advance.”On July 3, 2018, Individual 1 and others caused a wire transfer of approximately 390,000 EURO (the equivalent of roughly $450,000) from Company 3’s bank account in Ireland to Company 5’s bank account in the United Arab Emirates, in part for the benefit of Nepali officials, including Foreign Official 1On August 9, 2018, the Intermediary emailed Sharma, attaching two invoices from Company 5 to Company 3 for $1,000,000 each for “Service Provided for Bid and sale of X2 A330 as an Advance.”On August 10, 2018, Individual 1 and others caused two wire transfers of approximately $1,000,000 each from Company 3’s bank account in Ireland to Company 5’s bank account in the United Arab Emirates, partly for the benefit of Nepali officials, including Foreign Official 1. \nPrime Minister KP Sharma Oli, leading a high-level delegation, departed for Beijing on Monday via a special diplomatic flight operated by Himalaya Airlines.The President of Himalaya Airlines, Zhou Enyong, welcomed the prime minister on board. The delegation is set to return to Nepal on December 5 on Himalaya’s Airbus 319. Vijay Shrestha, Vice President of the airline, said, “It is a great honour for us to serve the nation by operating special flights for the official travel of the head of the government.” The Airbus A319, registered as 9N-AJK, departed Tribhuvan International Airport at 11:16 NST and landed at Beijing Capital International Airport at 18:03 local time.   \nEminent city doctors and health experts today gave a call for caution, mass awareness and improved government policies to minimise the use of microplastics that can cause several health hazards, including cancer.Tiny plastic particles that are less than 5 mm are called microplastics and are being attributed to severe respiratory diseases or even some types of cancer. According to Dr Monidipa Mondal, an eminent radiation oncologist, when microplastics enter the body through food or other sources, they first encounter the immune cells. “Being micro-mini in size, they can easily enter the immune cells after which a biochemical agent called cyclophane is released. The cyclophanes prepare chronic information inside the cells. “As we know if chronic information continues to get stored in the cells, it can lead to cancer. Apart from this, cancer is also related to free radicals. Therefore, it also creates oxidative stress in the cells and free radicals in the cells due to which cell multiplication occurs,” informed the doctor.As reiterated by Dr Mondal, recent studies have revealed an increased number of colorectal cancers among people. “It has been found in some studies that microplastics could be a possible driver of colorectal cancer. Another observation reveals a link between breast cancer and microplastic. We have also heard about BPA-free plastic. BPA or Bisphenol-A is an agent that can mimic estrogen. In some cancer cases, estrogen has been found. It can, therefore, be said that if it can mimic estrogen, it could also be a possible cause of breast cancer,” she added.According to research by India Clean Air Network (India CAN), degraded plastic from waste and wastewater discharge due to inefficient treatment processes are two of the major sources of microplastics in West Bengal entering the human body in various ways. The health experts recommended stronger and improved government policies to curb the menace of plastic. As pointed out by Professor Sadhan K Ghosh, mass awareness, particularly among young students is the need of the hour. “The first need is waste segregation. Second, the governance should be such that microplastics are not created for which legislation and its implementation must be done. Also, as plastic becomes brittle and enters our body while swimming or is even consumed by fish that we eat, littering sea beaches should be prohibited,” pointed out the professor.-In Association with ANN \nThe Kathmandu Metropolitan City has started providing ultrasound services free of cost to needy patients from its urban health promotion centres.Officials at the health department of the city office said that 10 out of 32 urban health promotion centres have already started providing services, and an additional five will also start the services within a month.“Any patient from any part of the country, if they are in Kathmandu metropolis, can receive the service,” said Deepak Kumar KC, chief of the health department of the metropolis. “We do not charge anyone any amount.”KMC officials said that ultrasound is a free basic health service the city office is committed to providing. However, patients must pay at least Rs400 for the services in the big hospitals and private clinics and hospitals charge additional amounts.Doctors recommend patients an ultrasound for various diagnoses, including finding the cause of pain and swelling, monitoring the growth and development of the fetus, and looking for blockages, among others.Officials say patients can bring prescriptions from other hospitals or doctors at urban health promotion centres for services.Along with ultrasound service, the city office has been providing physiotherapy services free of cost from all its 32 urban health promotion centres.The metropolis has also been working on setting up laboratories in all of its 32 urban health promotion centres.KC said that due to the lack of laboratory services in most urban health clinics, patients have been forced to seek services at state-run hospitals and private centres, which are often overcrowded and expensive. According to him, lab services will also be free to the patients.The city office runs 32 urban health promotion centres, one in each ward of the metropolis. The metropolis had recently opened vacancies to hire 108 staffers, including 32 physiotherapists, 29 lab technicians, four medical officers, five staff nurses, 10 radiographers, 10 pharmacy assistants, and 26 peons for the urban health clinics.The city office provides 98 types of essential medicines—for communicable and non-communicable diseases, including high blood pressure, diabetes, mental health, heart disease, asthma, cholesterol, and respiratory problems—free of cost.Patients with government health insurance can get over 300 types of medicines from urban health clinics, according to health officials.Earlier, KMC provided mental health screening training to doctors and paramedics at urban health promotion centres. Officials hoped the move would help hundreds of mental health patients in the city get timely treatment.Officials say that they are also planning to provide free medication to patients with mental health problems.Although neither the federal government agency nor the city office has data on the number of people suffering from mental health problems in the metropolis, doctors estimated that many residents could be suffering from various forms of mental health problems including anxiety and depression, among others.Health workers say that many city residents, despite having mental health problems, do not seek treatment and instead turn to drugs and substances to cope. Due to entrenched social stigma, fear of discrimination, and other factors, many patients in Nepal do not openly discuss their mental health issues.The metropolis has upgraded its urban health clinics to urban health promotion centres and started providing services through medical doctors. “Currently, we have medical doctors in all 32 urban health promotion centres,” said Dr Dibas Neupane of the metropolis. “We have been working to make our health service more effective.”The city office has also started campaigns in its jurisdiction to raise awareness of health hazards. The health department has started deploying health workers in various wards to examine sugar, blood pressure, and kidney function. “We have prepared a calendar for the health campaign every month,” said Neupane. “Health workers will visit the densely populated areas at least eight days a month to examine the health condition of locals. We hope that campaigns will help make people aware of their health and inspire behaviour change.” \nThough winter has already set in and the minimum temperature has dropped to seven degrees Celsius, the scourge of dengue-spreading mosquitoes continues unabated. Officials at the Ministry of Health and Population said that even though the number of infections from the deadly virus has declined, people are still contracting the disease.“Like in the previous year, we have not expected zero dengue cases in any particular month,” said Dr Gokarna Dahal, chief of the Vector Control Section at the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division. “New cases of dengue infection are still being reported from various districts.”Dengue is a mosquito-borne disease transmitted by female Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes. The same vector also transmits chikungunya, yellow fever, and Zika, according to the World Health Organisation.Post-monsoon is considered a high transmission season for dengue, but Nepal has witnessed outbreaks of the deadly disease since the start of the year and in the pre-monsoon and monsoon seasons as well.Entomologists say that even if dengue spread slows naturally in the winter, the risk of infection with the deadly virus has not lessened, as the daytime maximum temperature suits virus-spreading vectors to get active.“In summer, Aedes mosquitoes bite people in the morning and evening, but in winter, they become active during the daytime when temperatures rise,” said Sishir Panta, an entomologist. “And we should not forget that even though the growth of the virus-spreading vectors slows down in winter due to cold, it does not stop.”Thirteen people have died, and over 34,000 have been infected since January 2024, according to government data. The virus has spread in all 77 districts across the country. Experts say reported dengue cases may only represent a small fraction of the true scale of the outbreak, as around 90 percent of the infected people do not show any symptoms and health authorities often underreport deaths and infections.Many people infected with dengue show mild symptoms, which do not need any treatment or can be managed with paracetamol at home.As there is no specific treatment for dengue, health workers provide symptomatic care and diagnose patients based on symptoms, including platelet-rich plasma transfusion.According to experts, dengue became endemic in Nepal years ago, meaning that people get infected throughout the year.“New cases could surge once temperatures rise,” said Panta. “Also, the general public should not be complacent, as the risk has not been over. Prevention measures are essential to preventing the spread.”Experts say the disease will not stop spreading unless the lessons and experiences gained in previous outbreaks are implemented. Dengue-transmitting mosquitoes breed in clean water and bite people in daylight. Uncovered water tanks and discarded objects such as plastic cups and bottles could be breeding grounds for dengue-carrying mosquitoes.According to doctors, mild to high fever, severe muscle pain, rashes, severe headache and pain in the eyes are some symptoms of dengue. Doctors advise that those with these symptoms should seek immediate treatment. While there is no specific cure for the disease, early detection and access to proper medical care can lower fatalities.Nepal reported its first dengue case in a foreigner in 2004 in the Chitwan district. Since then, an increasing number of dengue infections, including major outbreaks, have been reported from many districts. The World Health Organisation (WHO) says there is no specific treatment for severe dengue, but early detection and access to proper medical care can save lives. \nA few days ago, a 50-year-old from Kaski district reached the emergency ward of a local hospital for treatment of abdominal pain. The woman, who was living with HIV, told the doctor about her condition before the start of treatment.“Then the behaviour of doctors and other health workers changed abruptly,” Puja Kunwar, programme manager of YKP Lead Nepal, quoted the woman as saying. “They also asked her to purchase separate gloves, masks and other items for the health workers. The behaviour of the health workers towards the woman, who has been working to lessen stigma and discrimination for the last two decades, was outrageous.”Although new data provided by the Ministry of Health and Population shows there has been satisfactory progress in reducing the HIV infection rate and deaths in Nepal, deep-rooted social stigma has not lessened as expected.YKP Lead Nepal, an organisation formed to engage with young people who use drugs, men who have sex with men, people living with HIV/AIDS, migrant workers, and sex workers, says that infected people are still being stigmatised in society.“Infected children are denied their rights to enroll in schools; adults are losing jobs solely because of their HIV status,” said Kunwar. “And these problems are not limited to a particular place, but are pervasive across the country. Due to similar discriminatory behaviours, many infected people do not dare to reveal their HIV status to family members and society.”The deep-rooted stigma against the disease is the main reason for concealing the disease condition, avoiding testing and treatment for a long time, or discontinuing medication, according to experts. They say that infected people cannot tell their spouse(s) about their disease conditions, and it becomes equally difficult for their spouses to readily accept the situation. As a result, many people conceal their disease condition, transmit the disease to their partners, and seek treatment only after their health deteriorates, say experts.“Even though the infection rate and deaths from HIV have declined substantially, we have not been able to make progress in lessening stigma and discrimination,” said Lok Raj Pandey, information officer at the National Centre for AIDS and STD Control.“Stigma against HIV-infected people is deep-seated in communities, which will not end easily.”It is also possible for HIV-infected women to give birth to a baby who does not have HIV. Similarly, two HIV-positive parents can also have an HIV-negative child, provided that the infected woman starts antiretroviral therapy before pregnancy.Experts say one can also avoid HIV infection by taking pre-exposure prophylaxis within 72 hours of having unsafe sex.Experts say people infected with HIV can live healthy and normal life spans if they get proper treatment. For this, treatment should be started early, and medicines prescribed by doctors should be taken regularly. According to data provided by the Centre, the HIV infection rate in Nepal in 2023 declined by 91 percent compared to 2000. Last year, only 457 people tested positive for HIV, and 231 were estimated to have succumbed to the disease. In the year 2000, some 5,100 infected people were detected, and in 2010, a total of 1,700 deaths were recorded, according to officials.Improved treatment is credited with the decline in the infection and death rate. Doctors say those who regularly use antiretroviral medicine don't pass the disease to others.The health ministry provides antiretroviral therapy free of charge to all people living with HIV. Currently, 25,728 people are receiving antiretroviral treatment (ART). There are 92 operational sites and 46 ART dispensing centres throughout the country.It is estimated that 30,300 people were infected with HIV in Nepal until 2023. Every day, at least one person gets infected with HIV in the country.  \nDusit Princess Kathmandu is organising a five-day trout festival at its SOI restaurant. The dishes will be available for order from 12:30 pm to 10:00 pm every day till August 30. In celebration of Nepal’s rivers and lakes, which provide an ideal environment for high-quality trout, the Director of Culinary Food and Beverage Service, Chef Utpal Mondal, and his team at Dusit Princess Kathmandu have crafted a menu showcasing the flavours and versatility of locally sourced trout. “As the festive month of Shrawan ends, people focus on healthy and nutritious food. Trout, rich in omega-3 fatty acids, vitamins, and essential minerals, offers a heart-friendly option that checks all the boxes from a nutritional and culinary standpoint,” says Mondal.He adds that the goal of the culinary event is to offer their guests a rare opportunity to experience a wide variety of trout dishes they wouldn’t typically find at home.The event menu features twelve unique dishes, six of which are drawn from diverse culinary traditions across continents. Three dishes are inspired by oriental cuisine, while the remaining three highlight flavours from Nepal and India. The menu has been designed to include various dishes, from soups and starters to main courses, including Mexican, Italian, Continental, and Thai flavours.While discussing the event’s highlights, Mondal said, “The celebration presents a unique opportunity for guests to indulge in a diverse range of trout-based dishes, something they wouldn’t typically have the chance to experience elsewhere.” \nI can vividly remember my first encounter with baking when I was 10 years old. We had just moved to our new home and got a cable connection. The cable opened a world of possibilities, as it gave me access to various contents.This was back in the late 2000s when YouTube would take hours to load, taunting us with its buffering screen. I was particularly drawn to travel and lifestyle channels, mainly TLC, Fox Life, and Food Network, which kept me informed about different foods and cultures. I don’t know why, but I was always drawn to desserts. It was fascinating to see how these miraculous treats made people smile at the end of the meal.Growing up in Nepal, I noticed that baking wasn't very common. While some families did have ovens, they were mostly multifunctional ones used primarily for heating food.I also noticed that most of our desserts didn't require an oven, as they could be made on a stovetop. So, you can imagine my excitement when my mom decided to buy an oven during one of her festive shopping sprees.I could finally feel the joy these channels portrayed. (I blame food writer Nigella Lawson for getting me hooked on a domestic lifestyle.) Then, one day, after watching one of the cooking episodes on television, I finally mustered enough strength and decided to bake something. I distinctly remember wanting to make a chocolate cake for myself after watching one of Rachel Allen’s bake series. I watched all the ingredients used in that recipe and scurried across my pantry, only to realise I didn’t have half of the stuff she mentioned. I then decided to improvise the recipe (a big mistake). I randomly combined the ingredients that I had in a mixing bowl and chucked the batter into my oven, hoping for a magical cake to pop out an hour later.After I saw the result an hour later, I was mortified. The cake was stuck in the pan, refusing to come out, and it was as dense as fudge. I convinced myself that the taste was what mattered most, but when I served a slice to my brother, he made a face of utter disgust.That was the day I realised that baking soda was not the same as baking powder.After this incident, I researched baking and found out it was technical. This was a blessing in disguise for me, as I loved science, and I started to view baking as a science experiment. I then reflected and evaluated how to perfect one's baking skills.I analysed my errors and noted down all the steps I did every time I baked. Home baking is a passion for many. The idea of turning a few simple ingredients into a delicious masterpiece is as enchanting as it sounds.Yet, for many of us, this seemingly magical process can often turn into a series of unfortunate events, leading to crumbled dreams and deflated ambitions. Dense cakes, burnt crusts, rock-hard cookies and unrisen bread, if you are an amateur baker, then you have seen it all. But why do these mishaps happen so often? And most importantly how do we overcome them?From my experience, behind every successful bake lies a series of challenges and mishaps that test even the most dedicated bakers. Baking has its own set of rules that you need to follow to get that scrumptious treat every time. So, to transform a recipe into an actual dish that will impress your friends and family, I am sharing with you some of the tips and tricks I learned from my tumultuous journey as a home baker.First things first, we have to look into the prime appliance that we are working with. Commercial ovens are of two types: one that runs on gas and the other that runs on electricity. We have to look at the oven present at our home and consider its pros and cons. The main benefits of a gas oven are its size and temperature control. One can quickly change the temperature just by twisting the knob, and it preheats much more quickly than an electric one. However, they are known to have uneven temperatures at times and release more humidity, making it harder to properly crisp or brown food. This can result in burnt edges and cold or hot spots. An electric oven, on the other hand, provides more even and consistent temperatures and doesn’t release as much moisture in the air.This dry oven environment makes it easier to brown your items, making it great for baking bread. However, while the dry oven results in more even cooking, you also run the risk of drying out cakes and other baked goods.Also, many people forget to preheat the oven before baking, which is crucial for maintaining an even temperature throughout the baking process. When baking cakes and bread, I like to place a small tray of water at the bottom of the oven to provide moisture and prevent the baked goods from drying out.An oven thermometer can be a baker's best friend, providing a true reading and ensuring your creations bake evenly. I also like rotating the pan midway while baking, as it allows for an even distribution of heat.The next thing people mess up on is measuring and the specificity of ingredients in a recipe. Our moms made our food with their instinct; it is something that they learned along the way, but when you are baking, you cannot instinctively add or omit a few steps.I think that is why we initially had problems with baking. In a culture where cooking comes instinctually, baking challenges us, to be precise. A gram of more or less of any ingredient can drastically alter the outcome. Different methods of measuring flour can yield different results.Every component in baking serves a distinct purpose and function. Flour offers structure, sugar adds sweetness and moisture, eggs bind things together, and butter enhances taste and texture. However, not all ingredients are created equally. For example, using salted butter instead of unsalted might change the taste profile of your meal.Similarly, different flours have varying protein concentrations, which affect the texture of baked goods. The type of sugar used also makes a difference. Granulated sugar, brown sugar, powdered sugar, and speciality sugars like turbinado or muscovado each add unique flavours to a bake.Understanding these nuances and how they interact is critical for getting the intended outcomes. Accurate measurement tools and techniques are essential, but mastering them can be a steep learning curve. So, I would recommend investing in a kitchen scale that allows for more accurate measurements by weight rather than volume.Moving on, leavening agents such as baking soda, baking powder, and yeast are required to make baked goods rise. However, they can also cause confusion and errors. Baking soda needs an acidic component to activate, but baking powder has both an acid and a base, making it self-activating.Using the wrong type of flour or sugar, or using them in incorrect proportions, can result in flat, overly raised, or collapsed cakes. Yeast, being a living organism, presents its challenges.The water temperature must be just right—not too hot to kill the yeast, nor too cold to inhibit its activity. Proofing times and conditions also need to be carefully managed to achieve the perfect rise.Bakers should also be careful about the way they mix ingredients. The method of mixing ingredients can significantly impact the final product. Over-mixing can develop too much gluten in cakes and pastries, leading to tough textures.Under-mixing can leave pockets of unincorporated ingredients, resulting in uneven bakes. Techniques like folding, creaming, and whipping each serve specific purposes and must be executed with care.Finally, home bakers must understand the importance of timing and patience in baking. Even a minute or two can make the difference between perfectly baked cookies and burnt edges.Recipes often provide a range for baking times, but factors like oven hot spots, pan material, and altitude can affect these times. It’s crucial to keep a close eye on your bakes and rely on visual and tactile cues, such as a cake pulling away from the sides of the pan or a toothpick coming out clean, to determine doneness.Baking is also an exercise in patience, a virtue not everyone possesses. Doughs need time to rest and rise, flavours need time to meld, and baked goods need time to cool before they can be enjoyed.Impatience can lead to underbaked centres, crumbling slices, and a general sense of frustration. Cultivating patience is as important as mastering any technique in the baker’s repertoire.Home baking is a journey full of ups and downs, but it comes with great rewards. The obstacles encountered teach valuable lessons in patience, precision, and perseverance.The satisfaction of success, the freedom to create, and the therapeutic benefits make the endeavour meaningful. Whether baking for oneself, loved ones, or as an artistic outlet, the journey is as fulfilling as the result. Embrace the flour-dusted countertops, occasional setbacks, and the joys of home bakingFor a beginner-friendly recipe that involves mixing ingredients and delivers amazing results, try my recipe for fudgy, nutty brownies that I call ‘Bliss Brownies’.Bliss Brownies150g unsalted butter plus extra for the tin150g chopped dark chocolate200g caster sugar½ tsp baking powder2 eggs80g cocoa powder150g plain flour70g mixture of nuts (walnuts and almonds)60g blended papayaMix all the ingredients (except the dark chocolate and nuts) in a blender or a food processor and blitz till you get a smooth paste.Fold the chocolate and the nuts into the brownie batter, making sure that the pieces are evenly mixed in.Grease a loaf pan with soft butter and dust with cocoa powder. Pour the batter into the loaf pan.Bake in a preheated oven at 170c for 40 minutes and let it cool in the oven for an hour. Enjoy with a cup of coffee or, as I like it, a scoop of vanilla ice cream. \nIn a world where acceptance and safety often seem difficult to attain, many queer individuals also struggle to find a safe space to express themselves. They have to hide their true self and face relentless judgement when going to public places like cafes and restaurants.This is the reality for countless LGBTQIA+ individuals. The need for a safe space for this community is not just a desire but a necessity—a space where one can be themselves. This struggle for safety and acceptance can be traced to crucial historical moments, such as the Stonewall Riots of 1969 in New York City.The Stonewall Inn was more than a bar; it was a refuge for the queer community. When police raided the bar, the community fought back. This series of violent confrontations, which began in the early hours of June 28, 1969, between police and gay rights activists, marked the beginning of the modern LGBTQIA+ rights movement. The spirit of Stonewall, the fight for dignity and the right to exist openly lives on in places like Inclusive Galaxy Restaurant in Kathmandu. Inclusive Galaxy beyond a restaurant is an ‘oasis’ for the queer community and beyond.Founded by Bishwaraj Adhikari, Mr Gay Handsome Nepal 2013, a human rights defender, the restaurant proves the power of safe spaces. It’s a place where the community can unite, free from the prejudice and hostility that often permeate their everyday lives.After years of working in the human rights sector, Adhikari and his partner developed the idea for Inclusive Galaxy. What began as a small cafe gradually evolved into a full-fledged restaurant, driven by the growing demand and support from the community.“In developed countries with strong LGBTQIA+ movements, you can find community areas like gay villages. These are created as safe spaces for people whose families and communities have excluded them. They also support new business ideas and pink tourism. I hope to see pink tourism develop in Nepal someday,” says Adhikari. His vision for Inclusive Galaxy goes beyond just being a restaurant. He aims to promote financial independence and empowerment within the queer community.Since its inception in February 2019, Inclusive Galaxy has become a key spot for many in Lazimpat, a relatively queer-friendly area in Kathmandu. The location is essential because the first LGBTQIA+ movement in Nepal started in 2001 through the Blue Diamond Society.Inclusive Galaxy, true to its name, welcomes everyone—queer and non-queer alike—to share a comfortable space. His vision was clear: to create a space where people of all genders and sexual identities could come together without fear of exclusion.“I didn’t want to make it exclusively for queer people because that would be excluding ourselves from society. Different groups need to live together and understand each other,” Adhikari explains.In the early days, the cafe attracted both queer and non-queer customers. However, when some of the residents learned about Adhikari’s identity and the nature of the clientele, there was a brief period of hesitation. “At first, I didn’t understand what was happening, but then I realised my identity was an issue for a few people. I believe people should be judged by others by their character, not by their gender or sexuality. Over time, as residents saw that we operated like any other cafe, they became more comfortable,” Adhikari reflects.Adhikari started Inclusive Galaxy to give queer individuals a place to be proud of themselves, counteracting the self-doubt and insecurity that hiding one’s identity can cause. This turned the cafe very quickly into a community hub. The journey was not without challenges, though. It was difficult to hire staff and cooks from the LGBTQIA+ community, and soon after the restaurant opened, the COVID pandemic made things even harder.Despite these difficulties, the doors of Inclusive Galaxy remained open. During the pandemic, many queer individuals, who were abandoned by their families or afraid to return home, found comfort at Inclusive Galaxy.Since many couldn’t afford to pay for meals, the restaurant provided free food from its resources. As the number of people needing meals grew to 20-30 daily, Adhikari started raising funds within the community.“During my time as an activist, many people came here not only for food but also to see an organisation where the queer community supports one another,” Adhikari says.“The time during COVID was difficult, but it brought me closer to the community.”Four years after its inception, the restaurant has garnered a loyal following. Sarosy Neupane, Miss Pink Nepal 2024 first runner-up, describes Inclusive Galaxy as her second home. She moved to Kathmandu to study in 2022. Being distant from her family, she started visiting Galaxy for meals that reminded her of home-cooked food. Over time, she grew attached to the café because of its welcoming atmosphere.“It’s heartwarming to see people from our community and different walks of life here. The founders even invite us to festivals like ‘Dahi Chiura Khane din,’” she shares.Neupane visits the cafe regularly and sometimes stays until 3 am, engrossed in conversations. “I hope more spaces like this can open in the future. If, unfortunately, this place were to close someday, I don’t think we’d have any other place to turn to,” she adds.Muna Chhetri, a trans woman who has been a loyal customer for three years, shares, “This is my safe space where I can truly be myself. I always feel judged in other restaurants, but that fear doesn’t exist here. It’s where even those who aren’t accepted at home can feel accepted.”Sahara Khadka Chhetri, owner of Pink Tiffany, Kathmandu’s first openly LGBTIQIA+ friendly restaurant and bar, frequently visits after managing the bar, appreciating the convenience of not cooking at home.She notes very few places like this cater to our community, and some even had to close during COVID. “As an entrepreneur, I know that sustaining these spaces is a challenge. But as more spaces like these open, they will make the way for a more inclusive and compassionate society.”The welcoming atmosphere at Inclusive Galaxy has also had a surprising effect on non-queer patrons. Samriddha Jung Rana, a twenty-year-old neighbour who identifies as straight, often visits the café and appreciates the importance of such spaces.“Previously, I didn’t know much about the queer community and didn’t care much. But now, coming into this café, I’ve been interested in their rights and issues. I’ve realised that we’re not so different after all. We are all human,” he remarks.The ventures like Inclusive Galaxy and Pink Tiffany have inspired hope for collaborative businesses between queer and non-queer groups. The recent initiative by the Nepal Tourism Board promoting Pink Tourism in April 2024 is a positive step. Still, Adhikari believes that more support is needed from the government and the private sector.Despite the progress, challenges remain. However, Adhikari remains optimistic about the future. He is working on plans to develop the restaurant into a homestay program in the future.“Like how different planets, asteroids, and stars make up a beautiful galaxy, people from all walks of life and identities make a beautiful society. I am happy that we are assimilating together in this space. We are not so different; we are all different and similar simultaneously,” he says. \nAditya Mishra is a Nepali chef and entrepreneur based in New York. Passionate about elevating Nepali cuisine globally, Mishra sharpened his culinary skills while staging at various Michelin-starred restaurants in the city during his time at culinary school. A recipient of the James Beard Foundation National Scholars Scholarship in 2023, Mishra’s early experiences inspired him to establish his own supper club, ‘The Sewing Tin’, alongside co-founder Akhil Upad.In an interview with Post’s Aarati Ray, Mishra discusses his restaurant in New York, serving Nepali cuisines there and the recipe for his signature dish.How did your cooking journey start in New York?At 14, I told my parents I wanted to be a chef, but they preferred I pursue a stable career like engineering, as many Nepali families do. So, I left for Louisiana in 2019 to study engineering.But, cooking never left my heart so, after a year, I left engineering college and moved to New York City. It’s been three and a half years and my parents only learned about it later. When my mom visited me in NYC and saw my dedication to cooking, she saw my passion and supported my decision.What sparked your interest in cooking from a young age?As a child, I was drawn to cooking shows on TLC. The glamour of cooking, eating, travelling and the prosperity of famous chefs was fascinating.Around age 16, I discovered Chef Anthony Bourdain’s groundbreaking book, ‘Kitchen Confidential’, which shed light on the reality of the culinary industry. I learned how he became a cultural icon in NYC, reshaping perceptions of chefs.I was also fascinated by chefs like Marco Pierre White, who was a mentor to Gordon Ramsay. Their stories of achieving fame while maintaining discipline intrigued me. But, as I grew older and entered the culinary world, I realised it was far from glamorous—it involved dedication and I am glad I persevered.How did the idea for The Sewing Tin originate?The concept of ‘The Sewing Tin’ came when I realised the stark contrast between the romanticised view of kitchen work and its harsh reality. Witnessing the struggles of many kitchen staff—economic hardships, immigration challenges and language barriers—I had to rediscover my love for cooking.During my internship at ‘Junoon’ restaurant, I met my co-founder, Akhil Upad, who shared my culinary enthusiasm despite his preparations for medical college. Together, we wanted to create a dining experience that was more personal and communal, offering fine dining with a sense of community.We wanted our food to tell stories, so we named our restaurant ‘The Sewing Tin’ inspired by the immigrant experience in NYC. When immigrants opened cookie boxes as kids, they often found sewing supplies instead of food.‘The Sewing Tin’ is like opening a cookie box and finding sewing supplies—something uniquely desi, or South Asian. How do you promote Nepali cuisine in New York City through The Sewing Tin?My partner is from Atlanta with Indian roots, while I come from Nepal, so our menu celebrates and reflects both cultures and heritage.We represent our respective cultures authentically. For example, we have a dish inspired by Newari cuisine called kachaila, similar to French Tartar. We present it as Tartar to make it accessible to our customers but infuse it with Nepali flavours, telling stories about its origins and giving diners a taste of my homeland.What do you think of the prospects of Nepali cuisine abroad?I’m on a mission to share Nepali food worldwide. I have served up dishes like chatamari and lamb sekuwa in my restaurant. But I’m still learning and want to explore more of Nepal’s cuisines. My big dream? To make Nepali cuisine reach more places because it’s got something special that can wow taste buds everywhere.How do you see the changes in restaurants in Nepal?The restaurant industry has deep roots in community and bringing people together, dating back centuries. While this core idea remains, modern restaurants have evolved, making changes to adapt to the times.Yet, in Nepal, despite the growing number of restaurants, many lack uniqueness and storytelling, focusing more on making money than fostering a sense of community.I’ve noticed a troubling trend of rising prices, especially for beloved dishes like momos, which makes people question if they're getting value for their money. It seems like profits are taking precedence over creating genuine, authentic culinary experiences.The industry is starting to lose the creativity and passion that once made it special. It might be time for chefs to shake things up, challenge the norm and bring fresh ideas to the table, revitalising the culinary scene with renewed energy and creativity.What challenges have you faced in New York as an outsider?Living in a bustling city like New York as an outsider has its challenges. But, this city is also full of opportunities for those who are passionate. If you stay true to your culture and want to share your story, opportunities are waiting for you.Even though it can be daunting because of the tough competition, the city appreciates determination and expertise. When I started my journey here, all I wanted to do was cook, eat and share the story of Nepal and its diverse cultures. Instead of focusing on the difficulties, I embraced the chance to follow my passion.What do you think about the criticism of blending Nepali food with modern culinary styles?Chefs care about their food—it’s like they’re sharing a story. They’ve put in a lot of effort to become skilled, so let them be creative. It’s okay to give helpful advice but don’t be mean just to criticise. Chefs shouldn’t also just copy what’s popular, they should cook what they truly love. That’s what makes food special and meaningful.Mishra’s signature dish:Confit Duck Chatamari A traditional Nepali delicacy with French influence.Ingredients:Duck (Legs and breast)Rice (soaked overnight)MayonnaiseWhole spices (cloves, cinnamon, cardamom, bay leaf)Red onionGarlicGingerMula ko achar (Fermented radish)ScallionsLemon juiceNepali pepperVinegarSaltSugarProcedure:For the Duck:Season duck with salt and pepper.Cook in a covered pan with whole spices, garlic, and ginger at low heat for 2 hours on a stove (270 degrees in the oven)Increase heat to crisp up the skin (approximately 15 minutes).Shred the duck meat.Confit Garlic Aioli:Mash cooked garlic and ginger and mix with mayonnaise, lemon juice, Nepali pepper and fermented radishes.Pickled Onions:Slice onions and cook in a mixture of vinegar, water, salt, sugar, and whole spices until softened (about 10 minutes).For the chatamari:Blend soaked rice to make a batter, let it ferment for 6 hours, and adjust consistency with water.Assembling:Cook chatamari batter in duck fat for 4 minutes.Top with shredded duck, aioli, pickled onions and scallions.Serve \nCeleus Baral exudes a serene aura when you meet her, and when she tells you she bakes, it makes sense. Even during a brief encounter, you can tell she has the patience needed to be a baker.“You can eyeball cooking, but baking is chemistry. You have to be meticulous. You cannot rush it, or it does not turn out as expected,” says the 21-year-old environment science student. She also runs the online baking shop Bakeleus. Recently, she has also started selling her baked goods beyond her online shop, with her first stall appearing at The Yellow House’s Night Market. Bakeleus’s menu lists a variety of offerings, including jams, granola, tarts, cakes, cookies, cupcakes and brownies. Baral began baking in 2020, during the lockdown, and launched her online shop last year.She grows much of the produce she incorporates into her baking, and believes we should all understand the origins of our food. “This connection fosters gratitude and a deeper appreciation for nature,” she says. Her background in environmental science, coupled with her affinity for the natural world, imbues her creations with a unique artistic sensibility. Each item she bakes is a testament to her creativity and experimentation, as she believes consistent practice is the key to mastery.Despite the demands of being a full-time student, Baral strives to accommodate orders, typically requiring a minimum of 72 hours' notice for delivery. She is a passionate and discerning individual, evident in the love she infuses into her baking. Additionally, Baral advocates for a zero-waste policy at home, ensuring that every scrap of food and all household items are recycled.Three easy to bake recipes you can try at homeMini carrot cakes Ingredients:38 g milk or yoghurt35 g all-purpose flour1/4 tea spoon ground cinnamon1/8 tea spoon ground gingerA pinch of cardamom1 tea spoon baking powder½ tea spoon fine sea salt2 large eggs, at room temperature27 g granulated sugar13 g brown sugar (or 39 g of regular granulated sugar)1 tea spoon vanilla extract27 g extra virgin olive oil33 g carrots, peeled and shreddedChopped walnutsCandied lemon or orange slices (optional for garnish)Cream cheese frosting56.5 g unsalted butter, softened113.5 g cream cheese, softened1/2 teaspoon vanilla extractA pinch of salt250 g powdered sugarDirections:For the cake:Preheat the oven to 195°C.

They then began marching towards the presidential office.The leader of Yoon’s ruling People Power Party called for Defence Minister Kim Yong-hyun to be fired and the entire cabinet to resign. Kim has offered to resign, the defence ministry said.Yoon told the nation in a television speech late on Tuesday that martial law was needed to defend the country from pro-North Korean anti-state forces and protect the free constitutional order, although he cited no specific threats.Troops tried to seize control of the parliament building but stood back when parliamentary aides sprayed them with fire extinguishers, while protesters scuffled with police outside.Within hours of the declaration, South Korea’s parliament, with 190 of its 300 members present, unanimously passed a motion for martial law to be lifted, with 18 members of Yoon’s party present.The president then rescinded the declaration of martial law, around six hours after its proclamation.Protesters outside the National Assembly shouted and clapped. “We won!” they chanted, and one demonstrator banged on a drum.“There are opinions that it was too much to go to emergency martial law, and that we did not follow the procedures for emergency martial law, but it was done strictly within the constitutional framework,” a South Korean presidential official told Reuters by telephone.There has been no reaction yet from North Korea to the drama in the South.Yoon was embraced by leaders in the West as a partner in the US-led effort to unify democracies against growing authoritarianism in China, Russia and elsewhere.But he caused unease among South Koreans by branding his critics as “communist totalitarian and anti-state forces” as his approval ratings slipped. In November, he denied wrongdoing in response to influence-peddling allegations against him and his wife and he has taken a hard line against labour unions.Markets VolatileSeoul appeared largely normal on Wednesday, with the usual rush hour traffic in trains and on the streets.But Hyundai Motor’s (005380.KS)labour union announced plans to stage strikes on Thursday and Friday and some major employers, including Naver Corp (035420.KS), opens new tab and LG Electronics Inc (066570.KS), advised employees to work from home.South Korean stocks (.KS11), opens new tab fell about 1.3 percent while the won was stable but close to a two-year low with dealers reporting suspected intervention by South Korean authorities.Finance Minister Choi Sang-mok and Bank of Korea Governor Rhee Chang-yong held emergency meetings overnight and the finance ministry promised to prop up markets if needed.“We will inject unlimited liquidity into stocks, bonds, short-term money market as well as forex market for the time being until they are fully normalised,” a government statement said.Sales of canned goods, instant noodles and bottled water had soared overnight, said a major South Korean convenience store chain, which sought anonymity.“I’m deeply disturbed by this kind of situation, and I’m very concerned about the future of the country,” 39-year-old Seoul resident Kim Byeong-in told Reuters.The National Assembly can impeach the president if more than two-thirds of lawmakers vote in favour. A trial by the constitutional court follows, which can confirm the motion with a vote by six of the nine justices.Yoon’s party has 108 seats in the 300-member legislature.‘Dodged a Bullet’If Yoon resigned or was removed from office, Prime Minister Han Duck-soo would fill in as leader until a new election was held within 60 days.“South Korea as a nation dodged a bullet, but President Yoon may have shot himself in the foot,” Danny Russel, vice president of the Asia Society Policy Institute think tank in the United States, said of the first martial law declaration in South Korea since 1980.US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said he welcomed Yoon's decision to rescind the martial law declaration.“We continue to expect political disagreements to be resolved peacefully and in accordance with the rule of law,” Blinken said in a statement.South Korea hosts about 28,500 American troops as a legacy of the 1950-1953 Korean War.Planned defence talks and a joint military exercise between the two allies were postponed amid the broader diplomatic fallout from the overnight turmoil.South Korea’s political situation is an “internal matter” for the country, China’s Foreign Minister Wang Yi told reporters.Russia said it was following the “tragic” events in South Korea with concern.Yoon, a career prosecutor, squeezed out a victory in the tightest presidential election in South Korean history in 2022, riding a wave of discontent over economic policy, scandals and gender wars.But he has been unpopular, with his support ratings hovering at around 20 percent for months and the opposition captured nearly two-thirds of seats in parliament in an election in April.Martial law has been declared more than a dozen times since South Korea was established as a republic in 1948. In 1980, a group of military officers forced then-President Choi Kyu-hah to proclaim martial law to crush calls for the restoration of democratic government. \nChaaaiiittt…The spontaneous eruption of the sound of victory thundered through the neighbourhood of Nhyokha in the Kathmandu core. The line of a kite cut another. Looking out the window of her house, Sajani Shrestha saw children running full speed, shouting and fighting as they vied to catch the falling kite and thread. And craning her neck up to the sky, she could not count but only be mesmerised by the innumerable kites strewn across the skies of Nhyokha, Bangemudha, Indrachowk. “There would be so many kites that they entirely covered the blue of the sky, making beautiful patterns of different colours,” says the 51-year-old. “And you cannot imagine the number of times the call of chait rang in the air.”Clear blue sky and gentle westerlies, the season of kites has arrived in the Kathmandu Valley. While kites soared Kathmandu's sky mainly during Dashain, the kite season officially started in Nag Panchami (August) and ended on the Haribodhini Ekadashi (November). And from royalities to commoners, young and old all flew kites from rooftops and open grounds. Even those who did not, like Sajani, revelled in the live spectacle in the sky as kites soared and fought. With Bhimsen Thapa’s help, King Girvanyuddha flies kites The earliest written account of kite flying is believed to date to 200 BC in China. In Kathmandu, this tradition has religious and socio-cultural and environmental significance, says Tina Manandhar, lecturer of Nepalese History, Culture and Archaeology at Tribhuvan University. According to her, it is believed that kites in Kathmandu skies carry a message to the god of rain Indra that the valley's farmers have had enough rain for their crops. That is why Kathmandu farmers scolded anyone flying kites before plantation season.In an article ‘Changako Utpati Ra Bikas’ published in Gorkhapatra in 1995, historian Rajesh Gautam points to the lack of written documents indicating the exact time when kite culture was introduced in Nepal. Exploring different opinions on kite's introduction to Nepal, he writes that “some have opined the possibility that the skill and tradition of kite flying might have entered Nepal through India.” Yet some others, he writes, state that kites “came to Nepal from Japan during the time of [Rana PM] Dev Shumsher.”He concludes that most likely this tradition was introduced by Malla-era Newar traders: “But since Nepal’s relationship with Tibet and China is very old and direct, kites might have entered Nepal through the Newar traders who were engaged in the trade. One can estimate that the kite was introduced to Nepal during the (mediaeval) Malla regime.”In Social History of Nepal, TR Vaidya, Tri Ratna Manandhar and Shankar Lal Joshi write that there exists documented evidence of the kite flying from the early 19th century. The authors state that Sundarananda, a contemporary poet, has mentioned that the young king Girvanyuddha Bikram Shah (r.1799-1816), with the help of Prime Minister Bhimsen Thapa, flew kites from the towering temple of Taleju Bhawani, Hanumandhoka. And when the king's kite cut the kites of the youngsters, they were located and rewarded with money.In Tyas Bakhatko Nepal, Sardar Bhim Bahadur Pandey states that “During the month of Kartik [October-November] young and old all flew kites,” suggesting that kite culture was ubiquitous in Kathmandu by the early twentieth century.Anticipations and preparationsKite flying in Nepal requires a kite, a lattai (a wooden spool), thread and majha (homemade adhesive prepared by boiling snail slime, rice or sago, and powdered glass from burnt electric bulbs and coated on the line to sharpen it for kite fighting).77-year-old Nirmal Man Tuladhar, an avid kite flyer and retired professor of Linguistics at the Tribhuvan University, explains how Nepali tradition of kite flying was both expensive and needing advance preparation.“In our times, it wasn’t easy to fly kites,” he says. “We had to prepare majha …And as Nepali kites are fighter kites, we mainly fought with other kites [which meant we spent a lot of threads].”This preparation needed first and foremost of passing a hurdle: securing finances and materials to fly kites. While lattai was a one-time investment that could be saved for years, kites and threads had to be replenished every time a kite was cut.“Those were the times when parents wanted us to be more focused in our studies. They only gave money [to buy kites] after immense pestering,” says 80-year-old Dwarika Nath Dhungel, former Secretary of Nepal government, speaking of the 1950s and 1960s.Biodiversity specialist and botanist Tirtha Bahadur Shrestha, 86, was born in Mahabouddha and began flying kites from 1951-52. He saved what little money he got for afternoon snacks to buy Hattimar reel, a brand of line wound in a small lattai, which was strong and sharp and where majha stuck well.Raghuji Pant, a member of parliament, also recalls the difficulty in securing money to sustain his kite flying in and around Kathmandu core in the 1960s and early 1970s. “Four to five of my kites were cut in a day,” writes the 67-year-old in his 2019 article “Changa Jastai Udi Hidne Man” published in Himalkhabar. “[This caused] the line in the spool to shorten. From Bhadra [August-September] to one to one and a half months after Dashain I spent flying kites. So, it was difficult for me to have enough kites even after getting money from grandfather, grandmother, mother and everyone.”Kites and thread secured, now began the crucial work of preparing and applying majha whose strength determined how well it cut other kites. Govinda Tandon, 70, a historian and heritage expert, who grew up in Battisputali, was also an ardent kite flyer.“Materials for making majha were prepared right from the morning on a holiday,\" he writes in his article “Dashainko Butte Changa” published in Gorkhapatra. “Because this work couldn’t be accomplished without a collaboration of 3-4 friends, a holiday was set aside for this. Moreover, a sunny day was considered appropriate. If the majha didn’t dry, the thread could turn moist, and so if it felt like the day wouldn’t be sunny, the entire plan…was aborted.”Kite makers, kite sellers and variety of kites One of the oldest shops in Kathmandu's memory, Shree Chitrakar Kite Center in Tyauda, Asan is bustling with customers during Dashain. “When my grandmother got married and came to this house at age 12 [in early 1940s], this shop was already here,” says its fourth generation owner 47-year-old Dinoj Chitrakar. “So the shop must be around a hundred years old.”Another shop that stands out in Kathmandu's memory is Manandhar Kite Center in Kalimati, established in 1949, and currently run by brothers Mohan Man and Sundar Man Manandhar.In his book Antar Taranga, artist and writer Manuj Babu Mishra recalls “a kite shop near the old halwai shop of Chabahil” in the 1940s. Dhungel and his 1960 batchmates of Juddhodaya Public School recall the kite shops from the 1950s and 1960s – Bekhacha’s Shop at Netapacho, Bhaicha’s Shop at Nhyokha, Lata Manandhar’s Shop at Maru, Kanchha Buddha Bajracharya Shop at Tyauda.Besides the shops, there were makers and sellers of kites cloistered in different localities of Kathmandu Valley.In Kwalkhu, Patan was a Joshi who made Nepali paper kites.“One day I accompanied my uncle to buy kites,\" writes Dibya Giri, 69, in his 2023 article “Changa” in Sahitya Post. “I was amazed to see the huge stacks of kites there. We used to call it the house of the kite maker.”In Nhyokha, Purna Bahadur Shrestha began making kites as a teenager and started his own kite business in the 1950s, according to his daughter Sajani.These kites, made out of Nepali paper, often had different paintings. Mishra recalls painting kites for the kite shop in Chabahil.“I went to that kite shop and with the freely available colours and Nepali papers, I spent my day painting faces, birds, animals, masks, mountains, hills, whatever came to my mind,” he writes in the book. “Such kites apparently sold well!”Most septuagenarians and older generations like Tuladhar and Tirtha Bahadur recall flying kites made of Nepali paper when young. Tirtha Bahadur says that kites from Lucknow began coming to Kathmandu only after the late 1950s. But at least a section of Kathmandu was flying kites from Lucknow from the early twentieth century. Vaidya, Manandhar and Joshi write that the Ranas and Shahs imported kites from Lucknow and that from them, their favourite employees also got to fly some. These kites were large and, in Tyas Bakhatko Nepal, Pande writes that they were referred to as Lucknowia kites.Known for their characteristic hissing sound they made while flying, light body, swift movement and ability to take sharp turns, Lucknow kites were preferred by kite fighters.“Lucknow kites were lighter and could be manoeuvred well,” says Tuladhar. “Kites of Nepali paper were stable but difficult to manoeuvre. They were also expensive. So only some fighters flew Nepali paper kites.”The kites had different names depending upon their designs and colours – Ambe (a heart in the centre), Dibdibe (chequered), Pakhete (a different coloured paper on one edge), Sete (white-coloured), Nilchi (blue-coloured), Rate (red-coloured) and so on.The kite fighters preferred the strong and sharp Hattimar reel that came on a small lattai. The Belchamar reel was cheaper but weaker and prone to be cut by other threads. Kite fliers and kite watchers on rooftops and open groundsBibek Shrestha, 57, and his two brothers took stacks of kites and climbed their rooftops. The rooftops around theirs in the neighbourhood of Nhyokha – in fact in all core settlements of the Valley – were filled with kite fliers and spectators. Many risked precariously balancing on the sloped roofs.While Bibek and his brothers’ kites alighted to meet the sea of kites in the sky, their sister Sajani and other family members gathered around to revel in the live spectacle.Dhungel remembers the rooftops of Jhochhen and surroundings of the 1950s and 1960s swelled with kite fliers. Dhungel did try to fly kites. But he did not become a successful kite flyer. What he did become was, like Sajani and many Kathmandu residents, an admirer of kites soaring in the sky.“But more than engaging in my unsuccessful kite flying attempts, I enjoyed looking at the kites flying. There would be a big crowd of spectators. Females and other family members watched the kites fly as they ate meat and chiura. Some even drank and rejoiced as they flew kites.”When the age of cassette player and speakers dawned in the 1980s, songs blared from the speakers alongside kite flying. Chitrakar and Bibek invited their friends, put their favourite songs on speakers and spent entire afternoons flying kites, dancing, singing and eating.Away from the core cities, in the villages in the Valley, people flew kites in open fields. Like Dibya, who set his kite for flight from the banks of Godavari River in Tikathali. Chhauni was also a popular space for flying kites.Kathmandu’s joy in kite fightingBibek pulled his kite down and then manoeuvred it back up so his line touched his opponent's line from below and quickly reeled out his line. The resulting sharpness from the speed cut the opponent's line.Chaaaiiitttt………“The greatest fun comes from cutting another kite's string,” writes Tuladhar in his 1996 article “Cutting is the greatest fun” published in magazine Kite Lines. “With its coating of adhesive paste and ground glass, the string is as sharp and abrasive as sandpaper on your opponent's line.”Nepali kite, Tuladhar says, is made to fight other kites, and describes how a kite line cuts the other.“The technique is to touch your rival's string and immediately reel out line at high speed,” he writes. “The Nepalese style of kite flying is aggressive, and though the kites look simple, they are strategically designed for bringing down other kites.”At any given time, like Bibek’s kite above Nhyokha sky, skies above the Valley were filled with raging kites, swinging, coming down and going up as the fighters reeled in and out their lattais in ferocious attempts to bring down other kites.Meanwhile spectators cheered. “Even passersby stopped to look at the kites,” recalls Tina.The moment of a kite cutting was accompanied by the sound of chait, and children ran in the direction of the falling kite to grab it and the thread in what was termed as, Dibya says, changa lutne/dhago lutne.Dhungel always joined in to shout the chait resounding through the locality of Jhochhen and almost automatically his feet sped towards the severed kites' direction.“‘Oii leave that thread,’ the kite owner would scold me. ‘Why do you pull my thread, leave it right now.’ But I’d continue pulling the threads as the owner continued shouting. Other times I caught the kites that had failed to fly and dropped on the ground.”The fallen kites got stuck in the buildings, trees or poles, or glided down in the open grounds or paddy fields. Falling kites from the Kathmandu core settled down in Tundikhel covering it. Oftentimes kites fell on the fields to rest upon the lush paddy nearing its harvest.“Children ran straight into the fields to catch the kite,” says Dibya. \"They destroyed the crops by stepping on them. Some farmers chased them, scolding along as they did so and if they caught anyone, they slapped them.”Love and restrictions on kiteAmidst the raging kite fights high up in the sky, there were apparently also some quieter kites lingering much lower among the buildings or tree lines, for their goals lay in not ruthlessly cutting the threads of other kites but piercing softly through the hearts of their owners' love interests. During the Rana regime, there were designated public spaces to fly kites, writes Gautam in his article. Referring to oral accounts, he writes that the Ranas were particularly careful to avoid kite flyers around their durbars. This is because love-stricken men tied letters to kites and flew them into the durbars to their love interests among the nanis.He writes that the kites could be flown mainly on the grounds of Chhauni. Anyone flying kites in any other place and around Rana durbars were arrested.Pant also recalls love-stricken boys from his time. “Just as kites came in different colours and patterns, so did kite flyers,” he writes in the article. “Some wrote love letters using a few words in “symbolic language” on a plain kite and attempted to land it on the rooftop of the girl they liked. Some simply landed their kites on any rooftop if a girl appeared there and waited for reaction.”King Tribhuvan among kite fliersPande writes in his book: “Once or twice during kite season every year, King Tribhuvan went to Chhauni to fly kites. Legend has it that if the line of the king’s kite was cut, it flew to Lhasa. But since anyone who caught that kite received five rupees, everyone attempted to catch that kite.”In 2021 news report ‘Bhawanle Chhekidiyo Changa Udaune Aakash’ by Shivahari Ghimire published in Nayapatrika, cultural expert the late Satyamohan Joshi also recounts that “During Dashain, Tribhuvan came to the ground below Swayambhu to fly kites. […] He did not use the same thread to fly kites twice.”In the same article, Joshi says that the King also went to Budhanilakantha to fly kites and participate in kite flying competitions.End of season, end of cultureMohan Krishna Shrestha, 86, was born in Budhanilakantha. Every year, on the day of Haribodhini Ekadashi, he saw the annual fair at the Budhanilakantha Temple. He also witnessed kite fliers gathered in the open fields around the Temple.“Oh, it’d be a lot of people,” says Shrestha. “They came from all around Bhaktapur, Kathmandu and Lalitpur.”They flew kites on Ekadashi, Dwadashi and some even until Purnima.“They took all the remaining threads and kites that had survived Dashain and flew the last kites of the season,” says Tuladhar. “I remember my uncles, relatives and neighbours going to Budhanilakantha with their kites.”Joshi recalls in the 2021 article that King Tribhuvan also went to Budhanilakantha with his sons Mahendra, Himalaya and Basundhara. He greatly supported and also participated in the competitions there organised by the commoners. If he liked he gave prize money to the winners.This annual event lost its glory days after the decline in the open fields as buildings began to rise with the establishment of Budhanilkantha School in 1972, Mohan says.“The event survived in some form until the 1990s,” he says.But what happened after that?The end-of-the-season event in the 1990s was also an indication of the end of the age-old kite tradition.“If I go to my ancestral place in Asan to fly kites, it’s not possible for me to do that today because there are buildings everywhere,” says Tuladhar. “Cityscapes and urbanisation have created the obstacle for flying kites.”Dibya does feel like flying kites sometimes.“No space to fly kites today,” he says. “In the old times, there were river banks and open fields. Even if you fly kites, it gets stuck in somebody's rooftop or water tank or somewhere.”Yesteryear’s kite enthusiasts believe that increasing means of entertainment was another reason for the decline of kite culture.“When television came, kite flying started to slowly decrease,” says Bibek. “And then mobile phones robbed kite flying even more.”And so, when his sister Sajani cranes her neck up in the sky today, she rarely sees a kite.“Those days we heard one chait after another,” she says. “These days you won’t hear a single chait.” \nIn 2008 Matina Shakya was only three years old when she was appointed as the Kumari of Kathmandu. She was succeeded by Trishna Shakya as the new Kumari in 2017.Kumaris are revered as goddesses of beauty and strength in certain Hindu and Buddhist traditions. Worshipping young girls as Kumaris is a 2,000-year-old practice in Nepal. Since the 13th century, when the Malla kings ruled, the Newars of the Kathmandu Valley have been worshipping Kumari, a girl from the Shakya/Bajracharya community chosen to embody the divine energy of goddess Taleju Bhawani. The reign of a Kumari ends when she starts menstruating. So long as she is serving as the Kumari, she is believed to be the nation’s divine protector, safeguarding it from evil. Matina, 18, is now in her first year of college, studying for a bachelor’s degree in management. Her father, Pratapman Shakya, when asked about having a daughter who is the only living the goddess in the world said, “Not having your own daughter live in the same house as you seemed a little unfair, but we feel very proud to call ourselves the parents of the royal Kumari who is revered by people all over the world.”On March 9, 2023, he, along with Matina, were getting ready for a special function held to honour all former Kumaris from across Nepal. “There are often events to honour Matina as she was the royal Kumari, but this one was dedicated to all former Kumaris from different areas. There are 129 living Kumaris in all,” he added. Besides Kathmandu, Kumari tradition is followed in Bhaktapur, Lalitpur, and Kirtipur, among other cities.According to him, this was the first time an event like this was organised and the Deputy Mayor of Kathmandu, Sunita Dangol, was also in attendance.Throughout the year, many people line up outside the ‘Kumari Ghar’ to get a chance to visit the Kumari and get her blessings. Many foreigners stand out in the yard to catch a glimpse of her. Nepali people believe that if a Kumari smiles at you, it is a bad omen.Everyday, a tutor visits the Kumari to help her continue with her education as she is not allowed to step outside the Kumari Ghar. She takes her exams and does her homework from the Kumari Ghar itself. She also has the freedom to play inside the Kumari Ghar. Many former kumaris have pursued careers in their fields of interest or studied after their term ends, and they continue to be treated with the same respect. The tradition of Kumari has evolved over time. In the past Kumaris did not enjoy these freedoms.Because of various superstitious beliefs, Kumaris were not fully educated and were forbidden from getting married because of the belief that the groom would die soon if he married an ex-Kumari. They led secluded lives, were restricted from participating in normal childhood activities, and focused solely on their religious duties.However, now, these myths have been dispelled. Modern understanding has shifted to recognise that Kumaris, after stepping down from their divine role, have the freedom to marry and lead a normal life. The perception of Kumaris as isolated figures has evolved, with a focus on providing them with a more balanced upbringing. There have been initiatives to integrate Kumaris into regular social and educational settings, allowing them to have a more holistic and fulfilling childhood experience. “Matina was already familiar with the students from the school that she attended after her term as Kumari ended,” said Shakya. “The kids visited the Kumari Ghar frequently so that she could have a smooth transition,” he added. According to Gautam Prasad Shakya, who has been living as a caretaker in the Kumari Ghar, the changes made to the tradition are minor. “The traditions of Kumari have mostly stayed the same. All the rituals are still practised like in the old days,” he said.On 6 May 2005, Pun Devi Maharjan, a lawyer, filed a case in the Supreme Court claiming that the traditional practice of electing young girls as Kumaris, or “goddesses’, who are expected to follow certain social restrictions and appear at religious festivals, violated the rights of the child. Quoting Maharjan’s complaint, Puskar Mathema writes in Yuwamanch Monthly of October 2007, “If Kumari tradition is continued, it will undermine the fundamental rights as well the freedoms of children guaranteed by the constitution and child rights treaties. Apart from this, it will have a negative impact on their physical and mental development.”The case continued while Nepal overthrew the monarchy and declared itself a secular state in 2007. When the judgement was pronounced in 2008, the goddess was still in her role, now giving blessings to the country’s President. The court ordered that the Kumaris and ex-Kumaris receive better benefits and arrangements and ordered the government to improve their support and allowances.In April 2006, Prof Chunda Bajracharya filed a petition at the Supreme Court against Maharjan’s petition, who had argued against the Kumari tradition. Bajracharya contended that the tradition should be preserved as heritage due to its over 100 years of history.“People who don’t understand the culture shouldn’t comment on it,” she stated. Bajracharya also criticised the human right activists who contended that Kumaris were only allowed to wear the colour red. “People who say Kumaris are forced to wear red clothing all the time, are the same people who send their kids to schools in uniform,” she said.“After the 2008 court verdict, there have been a lot of improvements. Now, a teacher visits the Kumari Ghar daily to tutor the Kumari, who is expected to complete school assignments and sit periodic exams. All the former Kumaris now get benefits like scholarships and special pensions,” she added.Bajracharya is currently a professor of literature at the Tribhuvan University in Kathmandu.“The only significant change that the court verdict brought to the tradition was in terms of her education,” said Gautam Prasad Shakya, the caretaker. “Kumaris were tutored long before the case, but the case helped formalise this arrangement. After the court verdict, the time between 12 pm and 4 pm was designated as the Kumari’s tuition time,” he added.After the verdict, there was a concerted effort to provide Kumaris with access to quality education, enabling them to develop the skills and knowledge needed to lead fulfilling lives beyond their divine roles. There was also a shift towards ensuring that the Kumari's living quarters are comfortable, safe, and conducive to her overall well-being.Moreover, the selection process for the Kumari underwent reforms in the aftermath of the Pun Devi Maharjan case. There was a push for greater transparency, accountability, and inclusivity in the selection of the Kumari, with an emphasis on ensuring that the process was fair, respectful, and free from undue influence.Efforts were made to support their transition into adulthood, including providing them with comprehensive resources for education, vocation, and social integration. This shift aimed to address the challenges faced by former Kumaris and empower them to lead independent and fulfilling lives after their divine service.“The Kumari tradition has evolved over time. During the tenure of my daughter, we saw a lot of improvements. Even after her time as Kumari, Matina continued to get a lot of government support,” said Shakya, former Kumari Matina’s father.“Some people argue that child rights are being violated, but all of her rights are being upheld inside the Kumari Ghar. This is a unique and respected aspect of Nepali culture, and I don’t believe it violates any of my child’s rights.”While the Kumari tradition continues, its practices have evolved. “She enjoys this normal life and it didn’t take her long to adjust as well,” says Matina’s father, on her transition from the revered Kumari to the ordinary Matina. \nWhat animals did Juddha Shumsher have in his zoo?“We only have records of animals from the mid-1960s,” says Ganesh Koirala, who has been employed at the Central Zoo for the past 36 years and currently serves as its information officer and programme officer. “That too I hand-copied from an old torn-down file that I came across.”Today, the Central Zoo, which sprawls across six hectares in Jawalakhel, Lalitpur, houses as many as 1,298 wild animals of different species of mammals, reptiles, fishes and birds from Nepal and around the world—from tiger, rhinoceros, hippopotamus and red panda to its recent attraction: a pair of chimpanzees.After enduring decades of neglect under various government bodies, with its animals and infrastructure scraping along in a deplorable state, the zoo received a new lease of life with improved infrastructure and animal care in 1995, when it came under the management of the King Mahendra Trust for Nature Conservation (KMTNC), now known as the National Trust for Nature Conservation, in 1995.Today, the Central Zoo is an entertainment venue, one of the most happening places in the Kathmandu valley. Flocked by thousands of daily visitors, the zoo now also hosts rescued animals and those in need of rehabilitation. It is also a site for conservation education.But when Juddha Shumsher Rana (prime minister from 1932–1945) built the Jawalakhel Zoological Garden on the premises of his Jawalakhel Durbar (where Nepal Administrative Staff College stands today) in 1932, he did so purely for private interests—as a space of entertainment and amusement for him and his family.Built in the semi-wilderness of Jawalakhel around a historical pond dating to the 17th century during the reign of King Siddhi Narsingh Malla, the zoo also became the space he could use to show his respect for two women he revered, his mother and sister-in-law, and indulge in one of his favourite pastimes—gambling.Today, the Central Zoo, nestled in the heart of Jawalakhel's sprawling crowd, does not go unnoticed, and its story is well told. But what passions drove Juddha to build the zoo? What was its original layout? What animals did it have in the beginning? And how did Juddha spend time there?“I remember once seeing a small board that read ‘Jawalakhel Zoological Garden’,” Koirala says. “I don’t know whether it was from Juddha’s time or was made in the later years. It must surely be that Juddha built the zoo out of influence from the British given how this term was used by them.”Koirala adds, “There is a former employee, now an elderly gentleman who worked in the zoo in the 1960s. He surely has some stories from Juddha’s time.”Birds, beasts and palacesTo trace the birth of Jawalakhel Zoological Garden, one has to look at the history of Nepal’s rulers owning birds and animals.Like rulers around the world, Nepal’s royalty kept wild and exotic birds and animals in captivity as a source of pleasure and mark of wealth and power. The book ‘Social History of Nepal’ by historians TR Vaidya, Tri Ratna Manandhar and Shankar Lal Joshi details how Mallas during the mediaeval Kathmandu Valley to Ranas and Shahs in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries owned rare, exotic creatures. In 1708, a rhinoceros in Kathmandu Valley broke the iron chain in which it was bound and killed its tamer. In 1714, Bhaktapur’s King Bhupatindra Malla gifted a camel and an elephant to Kantipur’s King Bhaskar Malla to build peace.Among Shahs, King Rana Bahadur Shah in particular was reputed for his collection of birds and animals. He also owned a zoo outside his palace in Basantapur Durbar Square, where the Nepal Bank Limited stands in New Road today. The zoo contained “tiger, bear, monkey, elephant, horse, deer… heron, peacock… pigeon, wild dogs, rabbits, rats, mongoose.”Jung Bahadur Rana’s zoo on the premises of his Thapathali Durbar hosted a variety of birds and animals collected during his hunting expeditions as well as those brought from abroad. Jung Bahadur himself used to “supervise and inspect it”. Juddha Shumsher likewise had his own collection of creatures which steadily expanded into a zoological garden. Seeking wilderness in his Jawalakhel DurbarJuddha’s biographer Ishwari Prasad writes in ‘The Life and Times of Maharaja Juddha Shumsher Jung Bahadur Rana’ that between 1933 and 1940, Juddha shot 433 tigers, 33 rhinoceros and 93 leopards. An insatiable big-game hunter, Juddha had a deep fondness for being in the wild and among wild animals, and from this came, according to oral history prevalent among members of Kathmandu’s Rana community including Juddha’s descendants, the desire to own a zoo.Built in 1752, Schönbrunn Zoo in Vienna, the world’s first modern zoo, was already over 100 years old when Juddha was born in 1875. London Zoo opened in 1828 and Alipore Zoological Garden (Kolkata Zoo) in 1875. Nawab Wajid Ali Shah Zoological Garden (Lucknow Zoo) was established in 1921. Juddha’s inspiration, his descendants say, was most likely reinforced by his tours to zoological gardens during his visits to England in 1908 and to different Indian cities.An article titled ‘Central zoo in state of neglect’ published in The Kathmandu Post in 1996 says that Juddha one day “received a pair of leopards as a gift”, cementing his desire to own a zoo. A report ‘Central Zoo Master Plan’ prepared by the KMTNC in 1996 says that Juddha decided to build a zoo in an epiphany when he saw that some animals “including deer, a few rhinos, and some tigers had been collected from the Tarai and kept in Kathmandu” could be put into one compound in the “lonely piece of land with a large 16th [sic] century Malla period Pokhari”.The pond lay still and serene surrounded by green wilderness ever since Patan’s King Siddhi Narsingh Malla built it in the 1600s. On the grounds surrounding this pond, the Newars from Na:Tole, Pulchowk and surroundings had their devisthans where, for centuries, they gathered to perform their religious ceremonies during Basanta Panchami and Bhoto Jatra even after this area fell within the Jawalakhel Durbar.For the palace, the ground served as its extended garden along with a horse and elephant stable. Subodh Rana, 69, grandson of Juddha Shumsher, recalled his father Kiran Shumsher telling him that Juddha and his family sometimes also used the scenic grounds for picnics. If there was any spot where Juddha wanted to build a menagerie, it would be around this Pokhari (pond). One day, he called his grandson General Maheshwar Shumsher Rana and deputed him to the task of doing just this.The zoo’s layout—except for the small plots of lands acquired later—that was in place when it came under KMTNC's management was, the present and retired zoo officials believe, mostly the same as it was built by Maheshwar and so offers a peek into how Juddha’s zoo must have been like. Pond in the middle of the ground surrounded by enclosures—the southern bank housing mainly larger animals, and cages for birds positioned on the northern banks.From pigeons to the king of the jungleWhat animals and birds did the enclosures at Juddha’s zoo house?“We cannot tell for sure,” Koirala says.Once it came under government ownership, the zoo was tossed from one institution to the other for lack of interest and knowledge on the right institution to manage it. Amid all this chaos, documents were possibly lost and the zoo has no concrete record about the animals that Juddha must have once taken amusement at, said Koirala.Mukti Narayan Shrestha, 82, a retired secretary of the Nepal government, joined the Central Zoo in 1970 as a veterinarian when many original structures of the zoo were still intact. Shrestha also worked with an elderly khardar who, he says, was employed in the zoo since the time of Juddha and was about to retire when he joined.“In those days where the purpose of menageries was exclusively for exhibition and pleasure with no regard for the welfare and recreation of animals and birds, the cages were tiny and iron-barred,” Shrestha says.Elephant, horses, deer, monkeys, tiger, rhinoceros, clouded leopard, red panda, bear, palm civet (nir biralo), four-horned antelope, Himalayan goral, pheasants, Himalayan monal—from the mythical and the majestic, the gentle and friendly to the fiery and ferocious, Juddha’s zoo boasted them all, Shrestha says.Shrestha’s account is not different from the anecdotes passed down to other retired and present zoo officials and the members of the Rana community, who also detail the rare and the exotic fauna, like the gharial crocodile and porcupine, even the jungle’s king—creatures, they say, that Juddha must have received from foreigners as gifts—appearing alongside domestic birds like pigeons.Tidbits of published information also confirm that the zoo had a good collection of exotic birds and animals from Nepal and abroad. One such suggestion comes from Kalyan Shumsher’s ‘Shree Teen Juddha Mahima’ published during Juddha’s reign in 1943.“One need not travel abroad to see the incredible birds and animals found in foreign countries,” he writes. “It will suffice to see [those creatures] right here in the zoo opened by His Holiness Shree 3 [Juddha] in Jawalakhel.”Among these incredible creatures, one reigned supreme—lion, the king of the jungle.For one, it would not have satiated Juddha to build a zoo and not have the jungle’s king exhibited in it. Juddha hence must have done everything possible to ensure one for the zoo. Infrastructure at the zoo suggests that the lion indeed lived at Juddha’s zoo or, in the least, during the Rana regime.“Where bear habitat lies today, there were two dome-shaped attached enclosures with a holding room, constructed in the classic architecture that many enclosures in the British zoos had in the past. They had brick walls and lime plaster,” Koirala says. “These were built to house a lion in one cage and a tiger in the other.”Near these enclosures stood another cage that remains intact today, with the head of a roaring lion carved out of the wall on the top of its iron bars. Zoo officials as well as members of the Rana community believe that Juddha had this exhibit built to specifically house a lion.Remarkably, these Juddha-era infrastructural spaces are corroborated by a rare piece of photographic evidence. A 1946 photo of the zoo shows a lion while a Kathmandu mother and her sons stand in front of its cage.Juddha’s place of piety and playThe zoo was not merely a space that Juddha sought out for amusement and retreat in the outpost of his palace; he also used this place to express his deepest affection.This affection spills right at the zoo’s entrance, in the form of the life-size statue of Karma Kumari Devi, wife of Juddha’s elder brother and Rana Prime Minister Dev Shumsher. Karma Kumari stands tall in her regal costume shaded by a wide canopy. Juddha revered Karma Kumari because it was she who raised him and looked after his mother Juhar Kumari Devi after the death of his father Dhir Shumsher. On another prominent part of the zoo on the south-east, Juhar Kumari’s enthroned statue overlooks the pond. Juddha had commissioned the London-based sculptor Domenico Antonio Tonelli to cast these statues.When Karma Kumari’s statue was unveiled is not clear, but Juhar Kumari’s statue was unveiled by Juddha amid a grand function in 1935 on Jawalakhel’s most auspicious day, Bhoto Jatra. It was attended by the British Resident Frederick Bailey.“On June 28, 1935, at Jawalakhel Durbar… the pond nearby looked very scenic,” says a Gorkhapatra news report titled ‘Statue installation’ dated July 5, 1935. “Because it was the day of Bhoto Jatra of Machhindranath… and moreover since an ideal woman’s statue was being unveiled, there was a crowd of lakhs of people.”Less than fifty metres from Karma Kumari’s statue stands a one-story building with a pagoda roof that today serves as the zoo’s meeting hall. Juddha, an avid gambler, found the scenic semi-wilderness covered in trees and filled with the sounds of wildlife to be a perfect place to relish the game. So he built a building with twelve doors on its four sides allowing him and his fellow gambling compatriots the freedom to enter through a particular door that they thought would bring luck. He called it his Juwa Ghar, the gambling house, and built it with the sole purpose of indulging in the game he loved. Roar of lion reverberates in KathmanduThe sounds of the animals and birds in the zoo rose up in the Jawalakhel sky. Every day, until much later in the 1970s, roar of the zoo’s lion (there were later other lions) diffused to far corners of the Valley, merging the zoo with the spirit of Kathmandu and informing the city folks of its presence.But was the zoo open to the public as well?“I think once it was built, the zoo was open for the public,” Subodh Rana said. “It is unlikely that Juddha Shumsher built such a large zoo and kept it only for his family.”For one, Kalyan Shumsher mentioning that one “need not travel abroad to see the incredible birds and animals found in foreign countries” suggests that the public had at least some access to the zoo. Of course, the Newar community from Na:Tole, Pulchowk and surrounding areas were permitted inside the zoo on the days of their guthi functions on Basanta Panchami and Bhoto Jatra.As the zoo was established at the back of the ground where Bhoto Jatra celebrations happen, it naturally filled with revellers on this day in addition to the guthi ritual observers as testified by the Gorkhapatra report. The photo of the mother and her sons also bear testimony that the zoo was not entirely closed to the public.What is widely believed, though, is that the zoo officially came under government ownership after Nepal became a democracy in 1951. And it would still be a few more years before it was open to the public in 1956.In 1945, Juddha gave up his power and eventually retired in Dehradun, India, where he died in 1952. With time, Jawalakhel Zoological Garden became the Central Zoo. It would take many avatars—a neglected site of crammed, unmaintained cages with sad eyes of emaciated creatures staring from behind the bars, a focal point of animal diplomacy, particularly during the period of monarchy, to, in its recent decades, a space of conservation and education.When all this was happening, the city sprawled around Jawalakhel, subduing the lion’s roar with its noise. More wildlife from around the country and the world came—creatures captured from the wild, those sold by circuses, those rescued from traffickers. Fate would bring these creatures to the care of generations of Kathmandu folks, intertwining each other’s joys and sorrows. After the tale of Juddha’s Jawalakhel Zoological Garden, there would be these stories to tell. Sitting around a table inside Juddha’s Juwa Ghar, Koirala and other zoo officials begin unfolding these stories before me. \nRecently, a 22-year-old man visited Sukraraj Tropical and Infectious Disease Hospital (STIDH) to get his sexually transmitted disease status checked after having unprotected sex. He was to leave abroad for higher education the following day. Likewise, several months ago, a young man expressed his distress over the intense pain following a penicillin injection administered against syphilis disease. When questioned about his marital status, he stated that he only had a girlfriend with whom he maintained a regular consensual sexual relationship. He further mentioned that the sexual interactions were generally unprotected. As per the hospital (STIDH) data, the majority of individuals receiving penicillin injections for syphilis are between 20 and 40 years old, with nearly two-thirds of that group being in the 20 to 30 age range. It’s a surprising but concerning public health concern in Nepal. Unprotected sexual contact not only carries the risk of syphilis but also increases the likelihood of other infectious diseases such as HIV, Mpox (known as “monkeypox”), HPV, gonorrhoea, herpes, chlamydia, trichomoniasis and hepatitis B. Since syphilis does not immediately show severe symptoms, many people do not get tested and thus remain unaware of their infection. There has been a notable rise in youths seeking foreign employment opportunities in recent years. This mandates medical examinations and blood tests, including for sexually transmitted infections/diseases. Following this, information about the spread of syphilis in Nepal has surfaced. People who engage in unprotected sexual activities, especially with more than one partner, have a higher likelihood of contracting syphilis. A bacterium, 'Treponema pallidum', is responsible for the infection. The transmission occurs through vaginal, oral, and anal intercourse as well as during pregnancy and through blood transfusions. Syphilis has four stages. On average, symptoms appear within three weeks of infection. This is referred to as the first stage. Sores may appear on the genitals, vagina, mouth/lips, or anus. As the sores are painless, many do not notice them or tend to overlook them. If treatment is provided around this time, the infection can be prevented from progressing to the second stage. Even without treatment, the sores typically heal within three to six weeks. However, the infection will progress to the second stage. Small rashes can be seen on various body parts (including the palms and soles) a few weeks after the first stage. Since these rashes are not clearly visible or do not cause pain or itching, people usually do not pay attention to them. However, symptoms such as fever, swollen lymph nodes, sore throat and fatigue can occur. The infection will enter the next stage, known as the 'latent stage' if left untreated. As per the hospital data, the majority of youths are commonly diagnosed and treated for syphilis during this stage. There are no symptoms in the latent stage; however, the infection can persist in the body for years if left untreated. The disease then progresses to the ‘tertiary stage’. This can occur 10-30 years after the initial infection. In this stage, syphilis can affect or damage vital organs such as the nervous system, eyes, heart and ears. Regrettably, information about complications or deaths due to the “tertiary stage” of syphilis is not well studied/known in Nepal to date. According to research published in the journal BMJ Open in 2024, 94.5 percent of sexually active students were found to have had risky sexual behaviour (RSB) in Kathmandu. Nearly one-third of the participants were found to be engaged with multiple partners. The participants ranged from 18 to 32 years, with a mean age of 21. The study only focused on undergraduate students residing in hostels in Kathmandu. Thus, the prevalence of RSB among Nepali youths might be significantly greater than what the research indicates. There is a pressing need for further research into this issue.There are numerous instances where people’s travel has been halted upon testing positive for syphilis because evidence of “no syphilis” is considered a crucial health requirement in employer health assessments abroad. Although treatment can cure the disease, the markers for syphilis often remain in blood tests. This appears to put young people in a difficult situation, especially financially, as they may have already incurred significant expenses by that time.We cannot ignore the fact that syphilis is spreading at an alarming rate among young adults in Nepal. It can be inferred that having multiple sexual partners and engaging in unsafe sexual practices without proper awareness contributed to the growing prevalence of syphilis among Nepali youths. Establishing an environment that fosters open dialogue and education regarding \"reproductive and sexual health\" among young people could significantly mitigate the challenges of rising syphilis infection in the country.  \nThe November 27 review meeting of the government’s performance in the first quarter of the current fiscal year (2024-25) was reportedly a big disappointment to the ministers and secretaries. Prime Minister KP Sharam Oli lambasted the dismal performance of key ministries and was irked by the worrisome economic indicators.Nepali economy reels under unpalatable paradoxical indicators. On the upside, the current account surplus is Rs112 billion, whereas the balance of payment is also in surplus of Rs185 billion. Further, the remittance inflow is impressive, with more than 10 percent growth. The foreign currency reserve is the highest in Nepal's history, touching $16.6 billion. The loanable liquidity available in the banking system has crossed Rs700 billion. Similarly, the non-performing assets in banks and financial institutions have gone up to 4.5 percent of disbursement. In its first quarterly review published last week, the Nepal Rastra Bank has chosen not to change its main monetary policy stance.During the first four months of the current fiscal year, till mid-November, merchandise exports were only Rs46 billion against the import of Rs513.4 billion. Capital expenditure remains pathetic at less than 11 percent of the capital allocation of Rs357 billion while it should have crossed at least 35 percent on average. Similarly, revenue collection is short of its quarterly target by about 15 percent. However, public debt is expanding exponentially, crossing 45 percent of the national gross domestic product (GDP) at Rs5.7 trillion. Development partners have not released any grants so far during the last four months of the fiscal year, and public financial management has thus become increasingly challenging.An agonising question here is: Despite some strong fiscal and monetary fundamentals as indicated above, why has the economic administration of the state failed to utilise them and waded through a widespread loss of confidence among investors, consumers and players in the market? Apparently, the reason for economic underperformance and pessimism is not only the inadequacy of financial resources but also the lack of failure in the overall economic management of the government on both fiscal and non-fiscal fronts. Economic managementEconomic management covers the quality of three closely related policy areas: Fiscal and monetary policies and sovereign debt. It is almost everything about an economy’s operation and governance.Despite shrinking revenue and alarmingly ebbing financial assistance from its development partners, managing a smooth stream of financial resources has been the greatest challenge to Nepal's fiscal policy or budget balance. Over the decades, subsequent governments have failed to consolidate their tax base and tax net, and undermined the importance of exploring new sources of capital to flow into the economy. Overdependence on import-based revenue is antithetical to the very idea of making the economy self-sustainable. The cause of concern is that the sovereign has barely demonstrated the management skills required to bridge the development financing gap, which is becoming herculean with time.Nepal Government’s official review report states that “to achieve the targets of the 2030 Agenda (Sustainable Development Goals and Paris Agreement 2030), a total investment of $163 billion is required for 2024-30, i.e. more than $23 billion per year”. This is an impossible task given that Nepal's total national budget in actual is barely $10 billion. Unless the government demonstrates its creative resource management ability, our dream of development and prosperity will not even be partially realised.The second glaring challenge is the lack of capacity for resource absorption at the government’s executing units, from federal ministries to ward offices in municipalities. Not only has the capital budget allocation come to 18 percent of the total budget outlay, but only about 60 percent of it is spent. This is purely a question of management efficiency at all levels: Project prioritisation, project implementation and project management at the ground level.Third, the biggest hurdle for the provincial and local levels is the lack of skilled human resources with economic understanding and management skills. Finding and maintaining human resources with thematic and sectoral competence, even at the provincial level, for planning, prioritisation, public procurement, plan implementation, expenditure effectiveness and expenditure monitoring is proving daunting. The situation is far more dire at the municipality level. Due to the lack of efficient economic management in all three tiers of the government, the necessity to review formulas of equalisation, grant allocation, revenue and other financial resource sharing does not seem to be the priority of the dispensation. After almost a decade of fiscal federalism, it is now imperative to have an evidence-based approach to review the institutional and operational efficacy of the gamut of public financial management under the federal polity.Emerging challengesEvidently, Nepal's conventional economic management paradigm faces challenges stemming from the vicious cycle of low resource availability and efficiency and low level of economic output (growth). A peek into the future brings about a new set of challenges to the fore. Among dozens of issues, three problems warrant immediate policy attention.One, Nepal's political and bureaucratic decision-making process has summarily failed to take the state’s federal architecture into due cognisance. Such evasion, omission and ad-hocism are more pronounced in economic and financial matters.Two, a critical departure is inevitable to manage the trade-off between Nepal's acute infrastructural social development needs and the obligation to make all these sustainable and environment-friendly. The unequivocal necessity to reduce the risk of climate change-induced disasters and prepare for post-disaster rescue, relief and rehabilitation compels us to source additional financial resources and their effective mobilisation.Finally, like any other developing country, Nepal's prospects of catching up to become a digitally advanced and knowledge-centric nation are contingent on its ability to invest in these capital-intensive endeavours. To bridge the growing digital divide across regions, ethnicities, economic classes and genders, effective economic management would entail not only finding the financial means but also involving a substantial social capital for judicious outcomes from every drop of the nation's investment. \nOnce, human rights were understood as the simple principle that one person’s rights should never extend beyond the tip of another’s nose unless invited. On December 10 each year, the world comes together to observe International Human Rights Day, a day that underscores the inherent dignity and the equal and inalienable rights of all members of the human family. First recognised in 1950 under the guidance of the United Nations, this day has evolved into a global call to action for the protection and promotion of human rights worldwide. Yet, despite decades of progress, violations persist across the globe, reminding us that the fight for human rights is far from over. The debate on human rights dates back centuries, and two of the most prominent figures in this discourse Edmund Burke and Thomas Paine left a lasting legacy that continues to resonate today.Burke, a supporter of the monarchy, saw the preservation of tradition and hierarchy as essential to societal stability, while Paine, a revolutionary thinker, championed liberty, equality, and the rights of individuals. One of Paine’s most famous lines, “We pity the plumage, but forget the dying bird,” directly addressed the hypocrisy of focusing on superficial issues while ignoring the deeper, more urgent concerns. In modern times, these words still carry weight, highlighting how we often address surface-level concerns while systemic injustices persist, unnoticed or unchallenged. The observance of Human Rights Day invites us to reflect on the progress made and the work still to be done. It is a reminder that the principles outlined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR), adopted by the United Nations General Assembly on 10 December 1948, remain crucial in shaping a more just and equitable world.However, despite the ground-breaking achievements of the UDHR, widespread violations continue, and the fight for human dignity remains on-going. Throughout history, the struggle for human rights has been a journey fraught with obstacles. One notable turning point in this struggle occurred in the United States during the 19th century. The abolition of slavery, a monumental achievement, came about through the tireless efforts of leaders like Abraham Lincoln, who, in 1863, led the nation to abolish the institution through the 13th Amendment to the Constitution. This was a transformative moment in the history of human rights. Despite the victory, however, African-Americans continued to face systemic discrimination and segregation for many years after.The 1954 landmark decision in Brown v. Board of Education, where the US Supreme Court declared racial segregation in public schools unconstitutional, was another significant victory for human rights in America. But even after this, African-Americans had to fight for basic rights like access to education, the vote, and an end to discriminatory laws. It was only in 1965, after decades of struggle and advocacy by civil rights leaders like Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., that African-Americans were granted the right to vote under the Voting Rights Act. These achievements were monumental, but they were hard-won, demonstrating the lengths to which marginalised communities had to go in order to claim their human rights. Internationally, the story of human rights has also been one of continuous struggle and progress.The United Nations’ adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in 1948 was a defining moment. It set out, for the first time, a global standard for human rights, affirming the rights of individuals to life, liberty, and security, among other freedoms. The UDHR became the foundation upon which many countries would base their own human rights frameworks. But the road to realising these rights in full has not been easy. Over the decades, the UDHR has been supplemented by two essential covenants—the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the International Covenant on Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights—passed in 1966 to reinforce and clarify the rights outlined in the UDHR.One of the key figures behind the development of the UDHR was Eleanor Roosevelt, who, as the chairperson of the UN Human Rights Commission, played a pivotal role in its creation. Known as the “mother of modern human rights,” Roosevelt’s vision for a world where all people were treated equally and with dignity shaped the discourse on human rights for generations. Unfortunately, she did not live to see the full impact of the UDHR, passing away in 1962, but her legacy lives on. Since 1998, the Eleanor Roosevelt Award for Human Rights has been awarded annually to individuals who have made significant contributions to the protection of human rights. As we reflect on the history of human rights, we must also acknowledge the many challenges that remain today.In the United States, for example, despite significant progress, debates about gun control and mass shootings continue to spark deep divisions. The United Nations and various human rights organisations have called for greater restrictions on firearms, but powerful interest groups like the National Rifle Association (NRA) continue to push back against any form of regulation. The on-going violence in schools and public places is a stark reminder that the struggle for human rights continues, and that the protection of human life and safety is an essential component of human rights. In India, human rights protections are enshrined in the Constitution, which guarantees the right to life, liberty, and equality. However, even in a country with such a strong legal framework, violations of human rights are not uncommon.Discrimination based on caste, religion, gender, and disability continues to affect millions of people across the country. While the Constitution guarantees equal rights for all, the reality often falls short. The National Human Rights Commission, which works to address these issues, plays an important role, but there is still much work to be done. The issue of discrimination remains one of the most pervasive challenges to human rights. Genderbased violence, including domestic abuse, sexual assault, and trafficking, continues to devastate the lives of women and girls around the world. In many countries, LGBTQ+ individuals face violence, discrimination, and the denial of basic rights.Refugees and migrants, fleeing war, persecution, and poverty, are often subjected to inhumane conditions and denied their rights to safety and protection. The most vulnerable members of society, including those who are stateless, face some of the most extreme forms of discrimination, and the international community must do more to protect them. On a global scale, poverty and inequality are also significant barriers to realising human rights. Despite progress in some areas, the gap between the rich and the poor continues to widen. Economic inequalities, along with the challenges posed by climate change, pose major threats to the realisation of human rights for millions of people around the world. The struggle for human rights is far from over.While progress has been made, there are still millions of people around the world who are denied their basic rights and dignity. The world must come together to address the root causes of discrimination, inequality, and violence. Human rights are not just abstract concepts; they are the foundation of a just and peaceful world. As we observe International Human Rights Day later this month, we must renew our commitment to these principles and work to ensure that they are upheld for all people, everywhere.The fight for human rights is not just the responsibility of governments or international organisations. It is a responsibility shared by all of us, whether through advocacy, education, or simply standing up for justice. We must remember the words of Eleanor Roosevelt, “Where, after all, do universal human rights begin? In small places, close to home.” It is in our homes, our communities, and our everyday actions that the future of human rights will be determined.—The Statesman (India)/ANN \nThe Nepal Premier League, which kicked off on Saturday, has taken the country by storm. Never before had a national-level tournament created such buzz among domestic and international audiences. Nepali cricket fanbase, who grew up watching the Indian Premier League, are now ecstatic to have their own truly international franchise league comprising no less than eight teams. The fact that people from different parts of the country are travelling to the Tribhuvan University Cricket Ground to cheer on their favourite teams speaks volumes about the tournament’s mass appeal.The ‘Festival of Himalayas’ features big cricketing names like former Indian opener Shikhar Dhawan, New Zealand all-rounder James Neesham, Dutch Michael Levitt, Namibia’s Gerhard Erasmus, and Australia’s Ben Cutting. Nepali cricketers—both national players and newcomers—will now get to rub shoulders with these global cricket superstars, which will greatly boost their confidence. The NPL will also hopefully offer these players enough financial incentives to pursue cricket as a profession. In fact, the recent all-format international success of the Indian national team is often attributed to the IPL, for some of the same reasons. The start of the NPL this year could thus mark a sea-change in Nepal’s success in international cricket. The league will have a global audience after getting the Star Sports Network, an internationally established TV network, as the official broadcaster; and after partnering with the Twenty-first Century Media Sports, a company that has managed many international events. They will help showcase Nepal as a global cricket destination. No wonder Nepali cricket fans are upbeat. As one fan placard during Saturday’s opening match between Janakpur Bolts and Biratnagar Kings put it: “No matter who wins it is the victory of Nepali cricket.”Done well, the NPL’s success will resonate much beyond the international sports scene. The vast majority of Nepali youths are looking to leave the country the first opportunity they get. They see no hope in their country. But when they see that cricketers and commentators and organisers from around the world are coming to their homeland to play as professionals, perhaps this feeling of disenchantment with their native country will go down a bit. Additionally, if Nepal can successfully pull off an international tournament like the NPL, there is no reason this welcoming country cannot host tournaments like the cricket Asia Cup. But there will also be challenges. The Cricket Association of Nepal has taken up the monumental task of organising an eight-team tournament. The association’s history of managing similar tournaments is checkered. For instance, the CAN-organised Nepal T20 League in 2022-23 was marred by controversies even before it kicked off due to allegations about match-fixing. The body has also faced criticisms for negligence, delayed payments and incompetence. Even in the opening match of the NPL on Saturday, the association failed to manage the crowd, which in turn led to injuries. The next day, fans were seen running on to the cricket pitch at the completion of a match. In order to maintain the integrity of Nepali cricket, it is vital to minimise such incidents. Hopefully, the CAN is learning with every match. The CAN must get the NPL right, for the tournament’s benefits are potentially limitless. The millions of international TV viewers of the NPL will get to see what a beautiful country Nepal is and this in turn could boost the country’s tourism prospects. The NPL itself, linked to a multitude of stakeholders, can create many profitable jobs, especially as other stadiums are built and the tournament expands to other parts of Nepal. Exciting times, indeed.  \nPrime Minister KP Sharma Oli heads to China today amid a heated debate on the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). At the centre of the debate is an argument over whether Nepal should accept only grants to develop bilateral Nepal-China projects or such projects can also be built with loans. In the end, the two main ruling parties—the Nepali Congress and the CPN-UML—decided that there would be no loan deals during Oli’s China trip. The Congress had been adamant that Nepal cannot afford any more loans and as such there was no question of adding a financial burden to the country. As things stand, 12 projects are lined up for signing. An agreement on the ‘BRI framework for cooperation’ is also likely, which, at least in theory, should add momentum to old and new bilateral projects. There are multiple readings of the two ruling parties’ disagreements on negotiating with the Chinese. In one, the Congress, as the biggest ruling party, played a dubious role by unnecessarily tying the prime minister’s hands before an important visit.Oli, in this reading, won’t have much to show at the end of the trip. Yet there can be an alternate and more charitable reading of the recent sequence of events—and one which will be more salubrious to the country’s interests. The BRI became so controversial on the eve of Oli’s China trip precisely because there was lack of clarity on what being a part of it entailed for Nepal. When the country signed up to the initiative’s framework agreement back in 2017, there was little debate even as grey areas galore. For instance, the document Nepal signed seven years ago is yet to be made public, fanning many speculations. In this context, the new debate on the kind of cooperation the country can expect under the BRI was much needed. Unlike in the past when they were querulous opponents, this time, as coalition partners, the Congress and the UML were forced to come to an understanding on the initiative. They did this through a four-member taskforce that carefully dissected the new China-proposed framework. The Nepali side has tweaked the new BRI framework document in line with the suggestions of the taskforce and sent it back to China for final approval. Nepal has long felt the need for a broad political understanding on vital foreign policy issues. Yet such an understanding has invariably been made a victim to top leaders’ never-ending jockeying for power. This time, the differences between the Congress and the UML over the BRI, and the wider debate it sparked, have helped the country arrive at a more nuanced position on how to engage with China, one of Nepal’s two most important foreign friends. The deals Prime Minister Oli locks up in Beijing matter. But, more importantly, the decision of the country’s two biggest political forces to devise a common platform on a vital foreign policy issue bodes well for Nepal. If and when Oli goes to India, perhaps the two parties can come up with a similar common position. And the same while dealing with other important foreign actors. The sum of these understandings can in turn form a solid basis for a more consensus based Nepali foreign policy. Perhaps this extrapolation is a little simplistic. But the goal of greater consensus looks more achievable today than it did even a week ago.  \nAs the world marks the 16 days of activism against gender-based violence (GBV) with the International Day for the Elimination of Violence Against Women starting November 25, it bears recalling the different forms of violence inflicted upon women and young girls and how effective these campaigns are. According to the United Nations, one in three women globally experiences physical or sexual violence in their lifetime. The reality is dire in Nepal too. The Demographic Health Survey 2022 reveals that one in three Nepali women aged 15-49 has experienced some form of violence. Further, with the rise of technology, women have been experiencing harassment, non-consensual sexting, hate and fear in online spaces. The unresolved and harrowing rape-and-murder of Nirmala Panta is an example of the pervasive and enduring nature of GBV in Nepal.Campaigns and activism hold great promise to challenge and confront the violence women face. In Nepal, the government, non-profit organisations and international agencies join hands to discuss the issues of women and find practical solutions. Yet their actions are mostly urban-centric, with rallies and programmes not reaching the grassroots level. For countless Nepali women in rural areas who face multiple layers of marginalisation, these 16 days offer little in terms of solace or change. Words don’t translate into actions even as their issues get the centre stage. Apparently, despite having abundant legal frameworks against GBV, Nepal ranks 71 out of 190 economies in the World Bank’s Women, Business and the Law Safety indicator, which focuses on four key areas: child marriage, sexual harassment, domestic violence and femicide. The UN’s report “Femicides in 2023” states that “home is the most dangerous place for women”. Nepal is no exception, as out of 21,568 cases of violence against women reported between July 2021 and July 2022, 80 percent were related to domestic violence. And intimate partner violence—a subset of domestic violence—remains the most challenging issue to tackle. Meanwhile, with the rise of artificial intelligence, deepfakes of women have become common. Our outdated cyber laws fail to cover new threats against women and leave them ever-vulnerable in online spaces; Nepal remains far behind in addressing technology-facilitated gender violence. While this slow progress is partly due to the enduring severity of domestic and intimate partner violence, which demands significant attention and resources from the government and other stakeholders, it would be dangerous to overlook online forms of violence against women. For women going through physical and mental trauma brought about by various forms of violence, no lofty words pronounced at forums offer relief. Addressing such pervasive issues needs practical actions like making them capable enough to recognise and resist domestic violence. It is also vital to goad survivors to break silence about the abuse they face, as according to the 2022 health survey, 58 percent of women who experience physical and sexual violence don’t seek support or speak up. If they did speak up, it would be much easier for police and other authorities to intervene and help. Yet more can be done. Alongside designated days to counter violence against women, as many women’s rights activists emphasise, there should also be year-round advocacy on GBV. Sensitising men about violence against women and bringing—and enacting—stringent laws to dismantle the evolving structures that perpetuate gender-based violence are the bare minimum needed to build safe spaces for women. \nChina-Nepal ties have remained stable despite political changes in both nations, with China emphasizing mutual respect, adherence to the \"One China\" principle, economic cooperation, and a peaceful and stable Nepal.\nFormer Indian chief election commissioner SY Quraishi advocates for credible elections and inclusive democracy, discussing the rise of right-wing movements, the role of money in elections, the impact of social media and artificial intelligence on electoral processes, and the benefits and challenges of \"one nation, one election\" in India.\nJames Neesham, a renowned New Zealand all-rounder, will debut in Nepal's Premier League (NPL) for Janakpur Bolts, bringing his vast experience from global cricket leagues.\nPolitical scientist Mehta discusses populism, India's foreign policy, including relations with China, Nepal, and the US, emphasizing the importance of social media, geo-strategy, and economic interests in international diplomacy.\nPrime Minister KP Sharma Oli's upcoming visit to China aims to enhance bilateral relations, prioritize project implementation, and seek infrastructure support, while ensuring that India's concerns are not escalated. Despite past delays in Chinese-supported development projects, Oli aims to negotiate grant conversions and expedite cross-border connectivity projects, balancing Nepal's relations with both its neighbors.\nKoshi Province's hills expect partly cloudy conditions Wednesday, while the rest of Nepal will remain mostly fair, with Janakpur experiencing the highest temperature and Jumla the lowest.\nOn Tuesday, the hilly regions of Koshi Province will experience partial cloud cover during the day, while other areas will remain mainly clear. During the night, hilly areas of Koshi, Gandaki, and Lumbini provinces will see some clouds, but the weather across other parts will remain predominantly clear. Janakpur recorded the highest temperature at 31.0°C, while Jumla registered the lowest at -3.5°C on Monday. No rainfall was reported across the country during the last 24 hours. \nThe Meteorological Forecasting Division has predicted partly cloudy conditions in the hilly areas of Koshi, Bagmati, and Gandaki provinces on Monday, while the rest of the country is expected to experience mainly fair weather. There is a possibility of light snowfall in one or two locations in the high hilly and mountainous regions of Karnali Province. Tonight, the weather will remain partly cloudy in the hilly areas of Koshi, Bagmati, and Gandaki provinces, with fair skies in the rest of the country. The Division said that the country is experiencing a moderate influence of the western winds. On Sunday, Janakpur recorded the highest temperature at 31°C, while Jumla experienced the lowest at -3.1°C. No rainfall was recorded across the country in the last 24 hours, according to the Meteorological Forecasting Division.  \nThe weather is expected to remain partly cloudy in Koshi Province, Madhesh Province, and the hilly regions of Gandaki and Karnali provinces on Sunday, with mainly fair conditions elsewhere.Light snowfall is possible at one or two locations in Gandaki and Karnali provinces’ high hilly and mountainous areas.Tonight, similar conditions will prevail, with partly cloudy skies in the hilly areas of Koshi, Gandaki, and Karnali provinces, and fair weather across the rest of the country.The Meteorological Forecasting Division attributes these conditions to the influence of a westerly wind system and Cyclone “Phenjol” in the Bay of Bengal.On Saturday, Janakpur recorded the highest temperature in the country at 32.6°C, while Jumla experienced the lowest at -4.4°C. Kathmandu’s temperatures ranged between 19.9°C and 7.0°C.  \n\nBe elaborative as possible. I need more text. Text only no title or headings.
