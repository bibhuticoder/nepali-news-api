{"title":"Give me a cool title for this story. Just give me title and no other text. \n I will give you a story and the news events from today. \n    Based on news events continue the story and provide me the updated story. In the story cover all the events as much as possible, try to weave them together, making a beautiful story.\n    Be elaborative as possible. I need more text. Text only no title or headings. Write it in the form of inspiring story not news article or event.\n    \n    Story:\nOnce upon a time, nestled between the towering peaks of the Himalayas and the lush jungles of the Terai, there was a country named Nepal. Though still a developing nation, Nepal was a land of profound beauty and deep-rooted cultural heritage. The residents of Nepal faced many challenges, but beneath these hardships lay a resilient spirit and an unyielding hope for the future.\n\nThis enchanting land, where Mount Everest reaches towards the skies and the air carries a mix of incense and cool mountain breezes, was more than a geographical marvel. It was a mosaic of cultures, languages, and traditions, a testament to human endeavor against all odds. Nepal's history, from the unification under King Prithvi Narayan Shah to its transformation into a federal democratic republic, told a story of aspiration and endurance.\n\nIn recent years, the people of Nepal, with their indomitable will, had taken strides towards rebuilding and reimagining their country. They turned their struggles into stepping stones, each challenge a chapter in their ongoing saga. The shift from a monarchy to a republic had not only changed governance but had woven a new tapestry of democratic values and collective decision-making.\n\nEconomically, while agriculture continued to sustain a large part of its population, Nepal had begun to harness the potential of its picturesque landscapes, developing sustainable tourism that promised to preserve their natural heritage while boosting local economies. Communities living in the shadows of the Himalayas had become stewards of the earth, protecting the biodiversity that made their country unique.\n\nEach day brought new stories. Whether it was a festival in Kathmandu, a technological advance in Pokhara, or a conservation effort in Chitwan, these events were threads in the vibrant quilt of Nepali life. These stories, updated daily, reflected the pulse of progress and the spirit of hope that characterized this resilient nation.\n\nAnd so, as Nepal moved forward, each moment was not just a passage of time but a promise of potential, a narrative of a nation perennially climbing towards tomorrow, guided by the legacy of its past and the dreams of its future.\n\nNews events:\nThe government has intervened in the dispute over the management of Gaushala Dharmashala between Pashupati Area Development Trust (PADT) and the Marwadi Sewa Samiti.In a letter on Thursday, the Ministry of Culture, Tourism and Civil Aviation has asked the PADT to halt the process of claiming the Dharmashala (charity lodge for pilgrims) property, northwest of Gaushala crossroads. Badri Prasad Pandey, the culture minister and an ex-officio chairperson of the PADT, has also called a meeting of the PADT Council for Sunday to resolve the matter.“Suspend all actions to implement the October 6 decision of the council [to take possession of the Dharmashala] until its [the council’s] next meeting,” reads the letter, adding that the move has led to insecurity in the Pashupati area. On October 6, a council’s meeting chaired by Pandey had decided to hand over the Dharmashala to the Kathmandu Metropolitan City. However, the minister has backtracked on the decision within 10 days following strong opposition from the Marwadi community, a prominent business group in Nepal.“We were working to implement the council’s decision. Now we have been asked to backtrack,” an official at the PADT told the Post. “Let's see how things unfold.” On May 23, 2003, the PADT and the Samiti had forged an agreement allowing the latter to manage the Dharmashala, paying an annual rent of Rs51,000. For the past few years, the trust has been requesting the Samiti to agree to pay more in rent. Following the Samiti’s reluctance to increase the payment, the council, on August 2 last year, terminated the two-decade-old agreement. Challenging the decision, the Samiti moved the Kathmandu District Court. But on October 2, the court scrapped the case, saying that the Samiti had failed to substantiate its claim. Four days later, the council’s meeting on October 6 decided to bring over 9.5 ropani (0.48 hectares) of land and infrastructure erected on it under its possession. It also decided to give the Kathmandu Metropolitan City the responsibility of managing the property.Since then, the PADT and the metropolis have been trying to vacate the property. However, people associated with the Samiti, a philanthropic organisation of the Marwadi community, have been obstructing them. They thwarted the metropolis’ attempt on Tuesday, which had made similar failed attempts on October 9. With repeated resistance from the Samiti, the metropolis administration on Tuesday wrote to the District Administration Office, Kathmandu to help claim the land and property. Similarly, the trust also held a press conference where it claimed the Samiti was in fact eying the land that belongs to the Pashupati temple.Officials also claimed that the Samiti was illegally obstructing the trust’s attempt to manage the Dharamshala, which is the trust’s property. The trust has also said the property will be used purely for religious purposes. Currently, the Samiti has been running hotels, lodges and restaurants, among other things, at the Dharmashala.However, the Samiti says it is wrong on the part of the trust and the metropolis to forcibly vacate the property even before the court has issued its full text. The Samiti asserts that it has tenancy rights to the Dharmashala property. Issuing an audio-visual statement on Sunday, it said the Gaushala Dharmashala has been under its possession for decades, long before it had reached an agreement with the Pashupati Area Development Trust in 2003. “The termination of the agreement doesn’t end the Marwadi Sewa Samiti’s possession of the property,\" it says. Those with knowledge of the Pashunath temple’s property support Samiti’s claim, saying the Marwadi community has managed the land and property for decades, long before the trust existed. Narottam Baidya, former member secretary of the trust and a Nepali Congress leader, had said the land was given to the Marwadi community for use as a cow shed by then Prime Minister Juddha Sumsher Rana in 1937 AD. It was a reward for their service to the victims of the 1934 Great Earthquake. The cow shed would provide the milk needed for worship in the Pashupatinath Temple every day. “Later, during the land survey, Gausahala Dharmashala managed by Marwadi Sewa Samiti was named as mohi (tenant) of the land,” Baidya had told the Post on Tuesday.Officials from the trust, however, dispute the claim that the Samiti has tenancy rights to the land. They say Juddha Saumsher Rana gave the land for use as a cow shed, not for running commercial outlets. The Samiti has no permission to erect any infrastructure in the land, says a statement from the PADT issued on Tuesday.The Samiti came into existence only in 2001 after being registered at the District Administration Office, Kathmandu, it claims.As per PADT officials, the Samiti is earning more than Rs6.1 million annually from the property, but paying peanuts to the trust. They also said that a seven-point agreement signed between the trust and the metropolis stipulates that the property should be used for non-commercial purposes, contrary to what the Samiti is currently doing.The PADT has cited additional evidence to support its claim to the property. In October 2006, after studying the matter, the Public Accounts Committee of the House of Representatives had recommended that the Trust take over the operation of the Dharmashala.The Auditor General’s Office made similar suggestions that same year. It has been pointed out that Samiti was refusing to revise its payment in violation of the provisions in the agreement with the trust. Now the council’s meeting on Sunday will decide how the ownership row moves ahead. “How can the council backtrack from the October 9 decision? How can they justify it?\" questioned the earlier-quoted PADT official. \nThe Political Parties Act-2017, which was nullified through an ordinance three years ago, has not been replaced, creating a legal void over the registration of new political parties.The Act has a provision that defines criteria under which dissidents of a political party can split the organisation and form a new outfit if they can prove the support of a certain number of central committee members and lawmakers of the mother party.In August 2021, the then Sher Bahadur Deuba-led government issued an ordinance to ease party split. It changed the provision, paving the way for 20 percent of the party’s central committee members and 20 percent lawmakers to form a new party. Earlier, any dissident group had to prove support of 40 percent central committee members and 40 percent lawmakers to register a new organisation. The law was tweaked to help the then CPN-UML leader Madhav Kumar Nepal and Janata Samajbadi Party Nepal’s Mahantha Thakur launch their own parties. Nepal at the time had supported the agitation led by Congress and Maoist Centre against UML chair KP Sharma Oli, who as the prime minister had dissolved the House of Representatives. The Article 114 (2) of the constitution states that an ordinance shall be tabled at the session of both Houses of the Federal Parliament held after the promulgation, and if not passed by both Houses, it shall ipso facto cease to be effective at the expiration of 60 days from the day on which a meeting of both Houses is held.Amid the legal confusion, the Election Commission registered the Ashok Rai-led Janata Samajbadi Party (JSP) in May. A dissident group led by Rai split the Janata Samajbadi Party-Nepal (JSP-Nepal) led by Upendra Yadav.The Election Commission then recognised the Rai-led party based on the Political Parties Act 2017 and registered it with the commission as per the Act’s Section 33 and Rule 5 of the Regulations on Political Parties 2017. However, three years ago, the Act’s provision was scrapped through an ordinance. Soon after the party split, Upendra Yadav moved the Supreme Court, challenging the Election Commission’s decision to recognise its splinter group as a new party. In his petition, Yadav claimed the commission registered the party despite failing to fulfil the required 40 percent support of central members for a split. While splitting the party, Rai had the support of seven of 12 lawmakers in the House of Representatives. However, he only had the support of 35 central committee members. According to the Election Commission, the party had 406 central committee members registered with the commission before its split to form the Janata Samajbadi Party. Thus the Rai-led group, even though it had the support of over 40 percent of the party’s lawmakers, didn’t have support of 40 percent of the central committee members.The case is sub judice in the Supreme Court for the past five months, and the next hearing is scheduled for November 21.Likewise, the Rai-led Janata Samajbadi Party, despite being in the government since the party split, has failed to engage in party’s organisation building activities even five months after its formation. “There have been some hurdles to carrying out party activities due to the court case,” Sushila Shrestha, a lawmaker of the Rai-led party, told the Post. “Despite the difficulties, we have been engaged in party formation activities, though not as proactively as we would like to.”Shrestha accused the big parties in the government of not doing enough to remove the legal void. Manish Kumar Suman, spokesperson of the JSP-Nepal, blames the government for the void. He stressed the need for reinstating the provision of requiring 40 percent of central committee members and 40 percent of lawmakers to split a party.“Our party has moved beyond party split, and we are currently engaged in party building activities,” Suman told the Post. “But should the government bring a new law related to political parties, it should require the support of 40 percent of lawmakers and 40 percent of central committee members to approve a party split.” Minister for Communication and Information Technology Prithvi Subba Gurung, who is also the government spokesperson, blames frequent government changes for the long legal void.“Earlier, the provision related to the split of political parties was made easy through an ordinance with the intent of splitting the UML. But after the goal was achieved, the then government didn’t bother to introduce a new bill to replace the ordinance [which automatically lapsed],” Gurung told the Post. Gurung, the government spokesperson, said he is unaware of any attempt by the present government to reintroduce the provision.Gurung argued that the matter is under the purview of the law ministry.Minister for Law, Justice, and Parliamentary Affairs, Ajay Kumar Chaurasiya, says the legal void won’t last long, even as the current government is not considering introducing new law related to political parties.“There has been no discussion on introducing the provision related to political parties,” Minister Chaurasiya told the Post. While the government is yet to remove the legal void created at the time of formation of the CPN (Unified Socialist), some dissident leaders from the same three-year-old party have reportedly urged Prime Minister and CPN-UML chair KP Sharma Oli to bring the law as they want to split the same party, the Unified Socialist.“But owing to the reluctance of Nepali Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba, Prime Minister Oli has been hesitant to introduce such an ordinance,” a Unified Socialist leader told the Post, asking not to be named for fear of reprisal. Some lawmakers and central committee members of the Unified Socialist are waiting for an opportune moment to split the party and join the UML. If a group of Unified Socialist lawmakers rejoins the UML, the Oli-led communist party, the second-largest in the House of Representatives, may then become the largest.At present, the Congress is the largest in the House of Representatives with 88 seats while the UML has 79 lawmakers.The Madhav Nepal-led party has witnessed serious factional feud following the election of office bearers and politburo members in August. Although the party concluded its general convention on July 5, the election of office bearers and politburo members was conducted later, only to create new rifts within the party. Some leaders even submitted a two-point memorandum to Unified Socialist chair Madhav Kumar Nepal on October 7, seeking to prevent a potential split in the party and warning of a growing threat of leaders and cadres defecting to the UML. “Many of our leaders would have defected had there been a clear legal provision on party split,” a Unified Socialist leader told the Post. \nFifty-three trekking trails were developed in Baglung in the last fiscal year to draw foreigners and local tourists, considering rural tourism's contribution to rural community development.A trekking route has been built to Teuwa, where a statue of Gautam Buddha has been constructed in the Open Sculpture Museum of Galkot Municipality.An hour-long hiking trail to Teuwa from Harichaur has been the latest draw for youth.Similarly, another trekking route has been developed to connect Kot Ghar, which once served as the fortress of the hilly kingdom ruled by the Mallas. The renovated historical palace offers a reason to visit Galkot. Kot Ghar, once considered the seat of powerful Malla kings of Galkot, a pretty kingdom in the confederation of 24 states known as Chaubise Rajya, has been restored and preserved to draw tourists. The Kot Ghar means a house where weapons are placed or stored.Mahadev Sapkota, a tourism entrepreneur, said that the construction of trekking trails in Baur, Kothekhola rural municipality-7 to Gumba has been attracting locals to the two-day hiking trail. In the last fiscal year, local governments constructed 53 trails in the district, spending Rs1 million to Rs2 million in each project.“We have been observing an influx of youth for trekking after the development of trekking trains,” said Prem Lamichhane, chairman of ward 9 of Kothekhola Rural Municipality. Bishnu Nath Sharma, information officer of the Tourism and Industry Office of the Galkot Municipality, said that the trekking routes with homestays have been attracting domestic tourists in the area. The Tourism and Industry Office of the Gandaki province in Baglung funded Rs66 million to construct the trails.Locals said that many infrastructure projects are unfinished, but the construction of trekking routes has become successful and meets the objective of community development.“For hiking of a day or two, the trail has become easy and attractive,” said Saurab Khatri, a youth of ward 9 of Baglung Municipality. “There is a need to promote these destinations to bring tourists.” Khatri prefers to hike rather than use the vehicle. “The trail has grabbed the attention of many youths like us.” In the last fiscal year, 73 tourism infrastructure projects were completed through the Tourism and Industry Office. With the expenditure under Rs500,000 to Rs2 million, most of the projects were trail construction. There are concerns that small projects are delayed and unfinished. Paar Singh Thapa, chief of the Tourism and Industry Office, said the tourism infrastructure project achieves 95 percent of physical progress. The trail has been constructed to connect the religious sites. Besides trekking trails and homestays, meditation centres have been constructed in two Buddhist sites. Thapa said the projects will increase economic activities by alluring tourists and conserving religious places. The office has also invested in developing Durleni, in Baglung, as a tourism destination.The Baglung municipality has allocated Rs25 million to develop the area as a tourism destination. Similarly, the tourism office has invested Rs1.5 million to construct a martyr's memorial park at Argal in ward 2 of Tarakhola Rural Municipality. “Investing in similar work can be repetitive. In such a situation, the office needs to be responsible,” said Amar Thapa, chief of the District Coordination Committee. “We have directed the authorities to prevent the duplication and implement such projects that yield results. The office has made investments to identify many places. A master plan has been formulated to develop tourism sites. Bharat Sharma, mayor of Galkot Municipality, said they had demanded a budget of Rs20 million to develop major sites as per the master plan. However, in some areas, the budget has been frozen as the project did not move ahead. The budget allocated under Ghumte Tourism Development in the last fiscal year was frozen. Rs1.5 million has been invested to maintain Udaya Righa Buddha Bihar, located in Righa Ward No.11 in Galkot, along with the trail. Rs1 million has been allocated for the construction of a tourism trail from Gaighat waterfall of the Tara River to Baraha Lake. Similarly, Rs1 million has been invested to construct tourism infrastructure in Soledada at Tamankhola rural municipality, Rs1 million for the construction of Jaimini Dham Meditation Center, and Rs2 million for tourism infrastructure in Kuduledham. Thapa said that tourism arrivals will rise as infrastructure has been built and renovated in the coming days. Thapa said a temporary assistant engineer from the Tourism and Industry Office is doing all the technical work on the projects. The local government has been trying to preserve the historical artefacts to showcase to visitors. The ancient palace of Galkot was in dire straits because of the lack of conservation.The Shreemeher Battalion barracks of the Nepal Army and Galkot Municipality have jointly renovated the almost-collapsed Kot Ghar. \nFive SAFF Women’s Championship finals in six editions. A 14-year long painful wait for a maiden SAFF trophy. Will Nepal be able to break the title jinx this time?“Our goal is the SAFF championship title,” Nepal captain Anjila Tumbapo Subba said on the eve of the tournament. “Our team is fit and balanced…we are ready.”Nepal begin their bid for a maiden SAFF Women’s Championship title and their first ever major international trophy against Bhutan on Friday.Nepal have played 11 finals in the last two and half decades and have won none.Nepal have been drawn alongside Bhutan, the Maldives and Sri Lanka in Group B. They take on the Maldives in their next group match on Monday before wrapping up the group stage by facing Sri Lanka on Thursday.Coach Rajendra Tamang’s side will be backed by home support once again—like the last two editions (2019 and 2022)—and will enter the competition as favourites.But the task will not be easy.Until 2019, India were the sole dominant force in South Asian women’s football, having won all the first five editions.However, their supremacy in the region came to a brutal end in 2022 when Bangladesh won the title for the first time. India were also beaten 3-0 by Bangladesh in the group stage.Nepal were the finalists and were largely tipped to win the championship after knocking out India in the semi-finals but their woes continued when they lost the final 3-1 to Bangladesh.On paper, these three sides (Nepal, India and Bangladesh) will be the top contenders again.India will look to reclaim the throne they lost two years ago, while Bangladesh will aim to assert themselves as the new powerhouse by winning a second straight title. For Nepal, the opportunity to win a first title is back at home again but they will first need to overcome the challenges of superpowers India and defending champions Bangladesh.“We have played a lot of finals but have not won any. It’s time for the players to step up and motivate themselves to break the jinx,” said coach Tamang, adding that they had been training with complete focus on the trophy despite a short preparation period.“We only had two weeks of training because of the ANFA Women’s League. It would have helped a lot if we were given the opportunity to play a number of international friendlies prior to the tournament.”“But, despite the setbacks, we have prepared well,” added Tamang.Nepal’s star forward Sabitra Bhandari is set to miss at least one match due to her engagement with French Club En Avant Guingamp. \nThe federal government has recommended immediate grants of Rs5 million to 10 million to each of the 71 local units declared disaster crisis zones. The financial assistance is aimed at providing relief and carrying out rehabilitation, and reconstruction works in the disaster-affected areas.In a meeting on Thursday, the executive committee of the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Authority (NDRRMA) proposed the grants in line with the declaration of these 71 local units as disaster-hit zones. The government on October 4 had declared 71 local units in 20 districts as disaster crisis zones.The local units declared disaster crisis zones are from Okhaldhunga, Panchthar, Udaypur, Solukhumbu, Khotang, Ilam, Kavrepalanchok, Lalitpur, Dolakha, Sindhuli, Sindhupalchok, Makawanpur, Dhading, Ramechhap, Chitwan, Rautahat, Mahottari, Sarlahi, Siraha and Saptari districts.The meeting chaired by Home Minister Ramesh Lekhak on Thursday decided that nine of the worst-hit local units would receive Rs10 million each, 12 affected units would get Rs7.5 million each, and the remaining 50 units would be provided with Rs5 million each, according to NDRRMA Spokesperson Dijan Bhattarai.The proposal will now be forwarded to the National Council for Disaster Management, chaired by Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli, in a meeting scheduled for Friday.According to Bhattarai, the allocated funds will be used to restore essential services and purchase supplies such as foods and tarpaulins for relief and rescue operations.Additionally, the meeting decided to allocate a budget for procuring helicopters and equipment needed for disaster rescue operations. It also resolved to request the government to offer free health insurance to the families of those who lost their lives in disaster-related incidents through the Council.In addition to Home Minister Lekhak, Health Minister Pradeep Paudel and Minister for Federal Affairs and General Administration Rajkumar Gupta also attended the meeting. Incessant rainfall on September 27 and 28 ravaged various parts of the country including the Kathmandu Valley. At least 244 people were confirmed dead and 19 people remained unaccounted for during the disasters.  \nNepal secured a 17-run victory in their first match of the T20I series against the United States at Grand Prairie Stadium, Dallas, on Friday.Batting first, the Rhinos posted a challenging total of 164-9 in their 20 overs, with captain Rohit Paudel leading the charge with a valuable 49 from 33 balls. Dipendra Singh Airee made a significant impact, scoring a rapid 28 off 17 balls, providing a late surge to their innings.Nepal got off to a solid start with Anil Sah (27) and Aasif Sheikh (27) forming a partnership of 48 runs. However, the middle order struggled to accelerate, with Kushal Bhurtel (10) and Gulsan Jha (11) falling cheaply.The innings were revived by Paudel and Airee, who added 50 runs for the fifth wicket.Harmeet Singh stood out for the United States, taking two wickets for 18 runs in his four overs, while Saurabh Netravalkar and Jasdeep Singh also picked up two wickets each.In response, the United States faced early setbacks, quickly losing both openers—Monank Patel (3) and Saiteja Mukkamalla (2).Andries Gous tried to steady the ship with a 30-ball 30, but his dismissal in the 10th over left the hosts at a precarious 56-4.Shayan Jahangir fought valiantly, scoring an unbeaten 60 off 34 balls, but his efforts were not enough to chase down Nepal’s total. Despite a late rally, the United States finished on 147-7.Nepal’s bowling was disciplined throughout the innings. Dipendra Singh Airee starred with the ball, taking three crucial wickets for 27 runs, including the important dismissals of Milind Kumar (22) and Jasdeep Singh (16). Karan KC (1-18) and Rijan Dhakal (1-21) also played key roles in restricting the USA’s batting line-up.Airee’s all-round performance earned him the Player of the Match award. \nThe mountainous regions of Nepal are famous for their succulent apples. For farmers in these areas, especially in Karnali Province, apple cultivation is their primary income source. Districts like Jumla, Humla, Kalikot and Dolpa have seen significant increases in apple production through commercial farming, with the province producing over 31,000 tonnes of the fruit last year alone. About the same quantity is expected this year. Yet, as promising as this sounds, it is disheartening that much of this produce never reaches intended markets due to the poor state of roads and other logistical challenges. After living in the shadows for several decades, even the far-flung places of Karnali have in recent years been connected to the roads; however, these roads are unreliable as monsoon-related natural disasters often make them impassable, especially during the apple harvest season. Last year, Dolpa district produced 3,696 tonnes of apples, but only 50 tonnes reached the lowland markets. Simikot, in the same year, harvested 4,224 tonnes, but none could be taken to other places due to transportation failures. The situation in Simikot is no better this year, as vehicles have not plied these roads for over three months. Poor roads are victimising the farmers in many ways. While the fruit is sold at Rs250 per kg in Kathmandu, farmers in Karnali’s Jubetha, for instance, get a meagre Rs45 for the same quantity. When the roads close, the price of transporting apples to lowland markets in Nepal rockets, further squeezing the farmers who are already at a disadvantage. Then come middlemen and traders, who reap the benefits of the farmers’ haplessness, charging extra to transport the apples. Seeing the fruits of their labour rot, some farmers resort to traditional store methods but still lose half of their produce. Others rely on air transport and mules, often resulting in more loss than profit.Hundreds of families have invested their time, money and labour in commercial apple farming, which has enhanced the reputation of Nepal’s apples abroad. They deserve more state support. There is an urgent need to improve farmers’ access to logistics, including bigger-storage facilities and efficient packaging methods, in the Karnali Province in particular. It is as important to expand the scope of subsidies in transport and storage. Given the recurring road blockages on the Nepali side of the border, exploring alternative nearby markets in Tibet could also be an option. Moreover, apples can be turned into value-added products to prevent waste, extend their shelf life and sell them in local and international markets. Farmers can be trained to ferment apples to make juice and local apple raksi (apple brandy). Many farmers also air-dry or sun-dry apples to increase their shelf life. These alternative products could open up new markets and prevent waste and loss.But above all, authorities should prioritise building disaster-resilient roads and routine maintenance to ensure year-round operation of vehicles. In regions like Karnali, it was new road access that encouraged more and more farmers to invest in apple farming. Now these same farmers feel cheated. Reliable roads won’t just boost the export of this highly-priced commodity. More importantly, they will safeguard the livelihood of thousands of families.  \nLimiting the analysis to the world of print, social scientific academic outputs are mainly put out as articles in journals or edited volumes and also in the form of monographs. Such outputs communicate the analyses of researchers to their peers and other members of the interested public. In this piece, my focus is on edited volumes, which have been an integral part of how scholarship has been developed by academics elsewhere. Having produced quite a few such volumes over the past 25 years and having commissioned some titles of this nature recently, I am convinced that edited volumes do advance branches of Nepal Studies. Hence they deserve close scrutiny that is often missing in our intellectual landscape.Let us start with some basics. Edited volumes come in two primary modes. First is the case when all or most of the articles contained therein have been specially commissioned for it and processed through various stages of the pre-press editorial work. Second is when all or most of the articles have been previously published and they are later brought together in an edited volume known as a ‘Reader’ in the publication industry.Irrespective of its type, the more useful edited volume is put together to attain thematic coherence among the selected articles. Such a volume usually contains a substantial introduction by the editors that locates the book in the proper academic contexts, provides summaries of the chapters contained and also delimits the scope of the collection. The introduction helps the readers to get a good overview of the relevant academic landscape of which the book is a part. It also helps to clarify the remit of the edited collection since no one book can cover all aspects of the theme in question. In a coherent volume, the editors also add references to other articles contained in it by indicating as much in the main text or the footnotes of the original chapters. This makes the chapters in the collection “talk” to each other. A user-friendly edited volume often comes with a decent index. Volumes with new articlesWith respect to edited books of academic writings, it was only in the 1970s that this genre really began to make a mark in the Nepali social science landscape. Some of the early such volumes were derived from papers presented at specific conferences. Among the books that have been important to me, I would mention Social Science in Nepal (1974) edited by historian Prayag Raj Sharma and published by the then Institute of Nepal and Asian Studies of Tribhuvan University. This volume contains a set of foundational reflections on the state of various social science disciplines in Nepal as presented in a seminar in 1973. It set a benchmark for later similar exercises.Edited volumes derived from seminars took off in the 1990s when many university departments and academic NGOs found the seminar-to-book publication route relatively easy to travel. While seminar conveners urged paper presenters to revise their written texts based on the feedback received from participants, the authors of such papers rarely received written comments from their peers who had gone through their texts carefully. Hence, the articles in these edited volumes suffered from the lack of careful peer-reviews and rigorous re-writing and were generally of modest quality. However, there were some exceptions. Edited volumes in which the chapters were critically reviewed by peer readers and the contributors managed to do several rounds of revisions of their texts have done well. For instance, Nepalko Sandarvhama Samajshastriya Chintan (2004) which I co-edited has sold more than 3000 copies. There are several other more recent examples of this type. The readers Readers are collections of mostly already published theme- or period-specific articles by different authors selected by the editors. In the literary field, readers are usually called anthologies. Such books are useful to introduce new students to the research landscape on the subject under consideration. They can also help to instigate new domains of research. Recently, I co-edited (with Lokranjan Parajuli and Mark Liechty) a reader, Nepal in the Long 1950s. In it we “aim to situate the events of that turbulent decade within larger frames both in terms of time—the complex historical processes that led to the transitions of the 1950s and continued thereafter—and space—the complex regional and global contexts in which events in Nepal took place.” It is for the readers to decide how successful the 10 articles (7 reprints, 3 new) in this volume are in terms of fulfilling that aim. We also hope that the volume will instigate younger historians of Nepal to move away decisively from narrowly conceived political histories of the 1950s. When it comes to the readers, the biggest challenge is to get reprint rights for the articles selected by the editors. For articles that have appeared in journals published in Nepal or in Nepal-related area studies journals published from elsewhere, getting such permission is relatively easy. However, getting reprint rights for articles that appeared in disciplinary journals published by big commercial and academic publishers can be difficult. While seeking reprint rights for articles originally selected for two readers (focused on the ongoing federal transition) published by Martin Chautari in the past two years, one such publisher wanted to charge as much as $680 for a single article. That article and others for which we did not get permission were not included in the published readers. In some other cases, we never heard back from the original publishers after seeking reprinting permission following their online guidelines.The missing volumesMany edited volumes on a wide variety of subjects need to be brought into existence by those who study those themes. Take, for example, the case of long-distance labour. While the income remitted back to Nepal by such labourers is crucial to the country’s economy, it is surprising that there isn’t a single reader covering various aspects of this phenomenon. The best academic writings on Nepali mobilities remain scattered in the pages of various hard-to-access journals. Talking about my discipline of history, Nepal’s historians have been particularly missing in publishing thematic edited volumes (a senior historian once dismissed such volumes saying “they don’t count”). Where is the edited volume on Nepal during the long 19th century? Where is the edited volume that covers the history of the changing gender dynamics in Nepali society during the 20th century? Our historians have been prolific in producing single-author monographs, but the absence of edited volumes explains in part why history as a discipline has been a loser when it comes to generating collective disciplinary outcomes and to being perceived as a “useless” discipline. It is high time that my fellow historians and other academics put out new edited volumes and readers on the themes that concern them intellectually.  \nIn my previous articles, I explored the perspectives of chief ministers from all seven provinces during programmes organised by the 'Federalism and Localisation Centre' in provincial capitals. While those pieces focused on federalism's progress and challenges from the current leaders' views, this article broadens the discussion by incorporating insights from former Chief Ministers—Dormani Paudel (Bagmati Province), Raj Kumar Sharma (Karnali Province), Rajendra Rawal and Dirga Sodari (Sudurpaschim Province)—as well as political party leaders, provincial speakers and other key stakeholders. Their collective experiences offer deeper insights into the structural issues, power dynamics and opportunities within Nepal's federal system. This piece examines the complexities of devolving authority to the provinces and identifies the key challenges that must be addressed to seize their full potential.Nepal's 2015 Constitution established a framework for decentralising power to provincial and local governments. However, its implementation has been marked by significant challenges. A major issue is the unclear division of powers between the federal, provincial and local levels. While the Constitution provides provinces with substantial authority, provincial leaders often express frustration over ambiguities in their responsibilities. This lack of clarity leads to administrative delays, governance inefficiencies and legal overlaps. For example, provincial land and forest management laws often mirror federal regulations, creating unnecessary duplication. To overcome this, laws should be aligned across all levels of government and provide clear guidelines on the separation of powers. Additionally, empowering provinces to tailor laws to their specific contexts is critical to enhancing their ability to govern effectively without interference from federal authorities.A significant challenge for provinces is their fiscal dependence on the federal government. The fiscal purse framework has created imbalances, with provinces heavily reliant on federal transfers to fund their budgets. Fiscal equalisation grants, intended to reduce disparities between provinces, are often uneven, leaving some provinces underfunded and unable to execute their development plans. Moreover, these transfers are frequently tied to federal priorities, limiting provincial autonomy. Delays in disbursements and bureaucratic hurdles further exacerbate these challenges. To address this, the fiscal transfer system should be reformed to ensure a more transparent and equitable distribution of resources. Provinces also need to develop internal revenue-generating capacities, enabling them to reduce dependence on federal transfers and invest in key areas like infrastructure, education and healthcare.Fiscal imbalances have also deepened inequalities between provinces. Wealthier provinces receive more resources, while less developed provinces struggle to meet even basic needs. The uneven distribution of grants and transfer delays hinder provinces from planning and implementing long-term development projects. The fiscal transfer system must be transparent, timely, and fair to rectify this. Equitable resource allocation will empower provinces to address their unique needs. This will help reduce provincial disparities and promote balanced development across the country.Another challenge is the limited authority provinces have over key sectors. Provincial governments are constitutionally empowered to manage areas like forestry, yet district forest officers still report to the federal government, restricting provincial control over natural resources. Similarly, delays in transferring police responsibilities to provincial governments have hampered their autonomy in maintaining law and order. Strengthening provincial authority in these areas is essential to ensure effective governance under the federal system.Political instability remains a recurring issue, weakening provincial governance. Frequent leadership changes, political interference and a lack of continuity in administration disrupt policy implementation and delay development projects. One solution to this instability could be the direct election of chief ministers, which would increase accountability and provide more stable leadership. Direct elections would also grant provincial leaders greater legitimacy, reducing the likelihood of frequent leadership changes. Additionally, extending proportional representation to the executive branch could promote inclusivity, ensuring that provincial governments reflect the diversity of the population.Bureaucratic inefficiencies further complicate provincial governance. Currently, provincial secretaries are posted for short one-year terms, which limits their ability to address local concerns effectively. Extending their tenure to at least two years would allow for more consistent administration and better policy implementation. Another issue is the reliance on federal employees temporarily assigned to provincial roles. These officials often lack the long-term commitment needed to address provincial issues effectively. Reforming the bureaucratic system to attract skilled professionals to provincial administrations is key to enhancing provincial governance.Infrastructure development remains a critical area where provinces, especially remote regions like Karnali, have fallen short. Despite their mandate to spearhead infrastructure projects, provincial governments face logistical constraints, financial shortages and political interference. Delays in procurement processes and restrictions on natural resource extraction have significantly hindered infrastructure development. Provinces must prioritise transformative projects and work closely with federal authorities to overcome these challenges. Streamlining procurement processes and addressing federal restrictions will enable provinces to accelerate infrastructure development, driving economic growth and improving access to services.Effective federal, provincial and local coordination is another area requiring urgent attention. While platforms like the Inter-Provincial Council and National Coordination Council exist to facilitate intergovernmental relations, these bodies meet infrequently and often fail to implement decisions. This lack of communication leads to inefficiencies, with provinces and local governments working in silos. Improving coordination and ensuring regular engagement between government tiers is essential for the smooth functioning of the federal system and for aligning provincial development plans with national priorities.Public-private partnerships (PPPs) allow provinces to enhance economic development, particularly in agroforestry, tourism and local product commercialisation. Provinces such as Karnali, which have vast potential in these areas, could benefit significantly from increased collaboration with the private sector. By fostering PPPs, provincial governments can attract investment, create jobs, and promote sustainable economic growth. Cross-border cooperation with neighbouring countries like India and China also holds immense potential for expanding trade and developing infrastructure, further boosting provincial economies.Finally, effective budget formulation and execution are critical for provincial governments to address local development priorities. Provincial assemblies should be more active in budgeting, ensuring that resources are allocated based on each province's specific needs. Nepal could draw inspiration from international examples, such as California’s Legislative Analyst’s Office and the US Congressional Budget Office, which provide direction and ensure that budgets align with provincial priorities. Strengthening provincial authority, fostering better coordination and ensuring equitable resource distribution will enable provinces to play a more effective role in national development, ultimately leading to a more prosperous and inclusive Nepal. \nThe episode of Bhatbhateni supermarket chain owner Min Bahadur Gurung providing land and announcing plans to build the head office of the ruling CPN-UML is dubious on multiple fronts. More than anything else, it has again exposed how Nepal’s politicians, political parties and businesspeople work in collusion for mutual benefit. There is nothing inherently wrong with politicians and businesspersons cooperating, for instance to create a business- and investment-friendly climate. But any initiative the government or the country’s major political parties take should be in the interest of the society, and not unduly favour any particular group or person. But what we see is that most collaborations between politicians and businessmen in Nepal invariably benefit vested interests. The deal between CPN-UML chair KP Sharma Oli and Bhatbhateni Supermarket owner has raised various questions. First, the way the party central secretariat took the decision looks suspicious. Though Oli convened a meeting to get the proposal endorsed by the party committee, even the party’s office bearers were reportedly kept in dark about the details and exact plans. Oli is not only the chief of a major political force but also the country’s prime minister. Even a layman can easily infer that Gurung, the businessman, didn’t make such a huge investment out of generosity. Another concerning thing about the Oli-Gurung deal is that the prime minister openly accepted the huge donation—10 ropani and 14 ana (0.55 hectares) of land and an investment to build a highly sophisticated building—from a person who is facing multiple corruption charges and whose cases are sub judice in the court. This is tantamount to openly promoting corruption and bad governance. Oli’s action has been criticised even in the UML party. Some leaders including standing committee member Binda Pandey have publicly criticised the deal and have demanded that the party correct it. They have admirably mustered courage to speak against the wrong of Oli, the party’s all-powerful chair, even when they know that he tends to take such criticism personally. If the past is any guide, such critics of Oli tend to be systematically sidelined in the party. This is not a one-off act by the chief of a major political party. It is an open secret that major parties give election tickets to businesspersons in return for financial help of various kinds. There is one thing common between Sher Bahadur Deuba of Nepali Congress, UML’s Oli and Pushpa Kamal Dahal of the CPN (Maoist Centre): all of them have over the years sought the help of controversial businessmen to prop up their parties or even their own factions within the parties. Oli is yet to offer a convincing reason for why accepting the donation was right. The occupant of the highest office in the land cannot act with such abandon, with seemingly no sense of accountability towards the people, or even towards his own party cadres. Oli has always been known as someone who is headstrong and not afraid even to shield goons if it serves his interest. He hasn’t changed much. Meanwhile, the public’s delusion with the old political establishment continues to grow.     \nIn February 2020, Nasreen and her husband Tofik were living in Shiv Vihar, an upcoming neighbourhood in northeast New Delhi. But that month, riots erupted targeting Muslims like them and Tofik was pushed by a mob from the second floor of the building where they lived, according to a police report he filed days later from hospital.He survived, but has a permanent limp and was only able to return to work selling clothes on the street after spending nearly 3 years recuperating.Soon after the riots the couple moved to Loni, a more remote area with poorer infrastructure and job prospects - but with a sizable Muslim population.“I will not go back to that area. I feel safer among Muslims,” Tofik, who like his wife goes by one name, told Reuters.Reuters interviewed about two dozen people, who described how Muslims in the Indian capital have been congregating in enclaves away from the nation’s Hindu majority, seeking safety in numbers following the deadly 2020 riot and an increase in anti-Muslim hate speech. Details about this phenomenon, which has led a major Muslim neighbourhood in Delhi to effectively run out of space, have not previously been reported.There is no official data on segregation in India, whose long-delayed census also means that there are few reliable figures on how much Muslim enclaves have grown in the past decade. Muslims comprise about 14% of India’s 1.4 billion people.Ground zero in Delhi is the central neighbourhood of Jamia Nagar, which has long been a temporary sanctuary for Muslims when communal riots break out.With ever more Muslims flocking in, the neighbourhood is overflowing, despite a boom in construction, according to 10 local leaders, including politicians, activists and clergy, as well as five real-estate agents.“No matter how brave a Muslim might be, they feel they have to move because if a mob comes, how brave can you really be?” said Raes Khan, a real estate agent in South Delhi who said Muslim clients now almost exclusively demand homes in Muslim-majority areas like Jamia Nagar.Segregation nationally has increased significantly in the past decade, said London School of Economics political anthropologist Raphael Susewind, who has overseen long-term field-work on India’s Muslim population.Rising Islamophobia under Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which came into power in 2014, is a “key driver” of the trend, he said.Six Muslim community leaders said significant anecdotal evidence supported Susewind’s assertion that segregation has increased. Jamia Nagar clergyman Md Sahil said the number of attendees at his mosque’s early morning prayers had more than doubled to over 450 in the past four to five years, and that it reflected the overall rise in population there.In response to Reuters’ questions, Jamal Siddiqui, a senior BJP official for minority affairs, suggested that poorer Muslims might choose to live in segregated areas because such neighbourhoods tend to be more affordable. “Educated Muslims leave the area and settle in developed areas with mixed population,” he said.However, Syed Sayeed Hasan, a Congress party worker in Jamia Nagar, said a big push factor for sectarian cloistering in Delhi was the 2020 riot. More than 200 were injured and at least 53 people, mostly Muslim, were killed in protests after Modi’s Hindu nationalist government moved to introduce a law that made it easier for many non-Muslims to become citizens.A 2020 Delhi government report blamed the riots on BJP leaders who made speeches that called for violence against protesters. At the time, the party said the allegations were baseless and that law enforcement had said there was no proof one of the leaders blamed in the report was responsible.The Delhi government, controlled by the opposition Aam Aadmi Party, did not respond to requests for comment. RISE IN HATE SPEECHIndia’s National Crime Records Bureau, a government agency that collects and analyses crime data, doesn’t keep records on targeted violence against communities.It said the average number of annual riots with communal origins had fallen about 9% between 2014 and 2022 as compared to the previous nine years, when the Congress party ran India.But independent experts, at the Center for the Study of Organized Hate, a Washington-based think-tank, have documented a significant increase in anti-Muslim hate speech, from 255 incidents in first half of 2023 to 413 in the second half of 2023. BJP politicians and affiliate groups were key to the trend, the think-tank said.Reuters has previously reported about how right-wing “cow vigilantes,” some of whom have ties to the BJP, have led lynch mobs against Muslims.Modi, while campaigning in April for a third term as premier, attacked Muslims as “infiltrators” who had “more children,” implying they were a threat to India’s Hindu majority.The BJP’s Siddiqui added that Modi was referring to undocumented immigrants like Rohingya Muslims whom he alleged “are living in India and are also weakening India.”When previously asked about alleged anti-Muslim bias, the BJP government has said it does not discriminate and that many of its anti-poverty programs have benefited Muslims, who are among the poorest groups in India.The BJP could only form a fragile coalition government after national election results were announced in June. In the immediate aftermath, at least eight anti-Muslim lynching incidents were reported, the non-governmental Association for Protection of Civil Rights said on July 5.SAFETY IN NUMBERSJamia Nagar is a bustling cluster of alleyways behind Jamia Millia Islamia, a Muslim university that was an epicentre of the 2020 protests. It anchors an area of southeast Delhi that has many Muslim neighbourhoods and a population of about 150,000, according to state election data.When Reuters visited the cramped alleyways of the enclave on a sweltering summer day, they were framed by five-storey buildings. Developers had added three storeys to what were many two storey buildings to cater to the increase in demand, two real estate agents said. In a sign of booming growth, there were also dozens of newly-built kindergartens set up in the narrow lanes of the area.Most Muslim enclaves are not as well-developed. A 2023 study, from British, American and Indian economists that analysed 1.5 million Indian areas found that public services like water and schools were comparatively rare in neighbourhoods popular with Muslims and that children in such areas often face educational disadvantages.After Tofik and Nasreen moved to Loni following Tofik’s assault, their income halved, with Tofik only able to work reduced hours.Nasreen’s 16-year-old daughter, Muskan, suffered. The school in the outskirts of Delhi was under-resourced, Muskan said, and she missed her classmates. After feeling that the new school wasn’t for her, she dropped out.But Nasreen doesn’t regret the move. “I will never go back. I have lost faith in them,” she said, of the neighbours who she said formed part of the mob that pushed her husband.Reuters could not independently verify her claim but Sam Sundar, a 44-year-old Hindu resident of Nasreen’s old neighbourhood, said both Hindus and Muslims suffered during the riots, which he blamed on outside perpetrators.But he acknowledged that Muslims bore the brunt: “Very few Muslims now live in the area. This is not a good thing.”Nasreen’s neighbour Malika also moved to the outskirts after her husband was killed in the 2020 riots. But she was unable to find a job and now also lives part-time at a small room in another neighbourhood with more Hindu residents, where she is close to construction sites where she does odd jobs.“Here I am afflicted with poverty, there I’m afflicted with insecurity,” she said.Enclaves have also drawn upper middle class Muslim families, who used to be more comfortable living in mixed areas, said Raes, the real-estate agent.“People feel it is better to live in separate areas rather than having a constant threat to life and property from members of the other community,” said Mujaheed Nafees, a Muslim leader from Modi's home state of Gujarat, which hosts India’s largest Muslim enclave of some 400,000. \nToday the weather is forecast to be partly to generally cloudy in the hilly areas and partly cloudy to mainly fair in the rest of the country. Light rain with thunder and lightning is likely to occur at a few places of the hilly region of Koshi, Bagmati and Gandaki Province and at one or two places of the hilly region of the rest of the country.Tonight the weather is forecast to be partly to generally cloudy in the hilly areas of Koshi Province, Bagmati Province and Gandaki Province and partly cloudy to mainly fair in the rest of the country. Light rain with thunder and lightning is likely to occur at one or two places of the hilly region of Koshi, Bagmati and Gandaki Province.According to the meteorological forecasting division analysis, the country is currently experiencing a partial influence of western winds, along with some influence of the local wind effects in the hilly areas of Koshi, Bagmati, and Gandaki provinces.On Thursday Janakpur experienced the highest temperature of 34°C and Jomsom experienced the lowest temperature of 9.5°C. Pokhara received the maximum rainfall of 51.2 mm of rainfall in the last 24 hours. \nFive-time champions India launched their SAFF Women’s Championship campaign with a 5-2 victory over Pakistan at the Dasharath Stadium in Kathmandu on Thursday.Grace Dangmei scored a brace for India, while Manisha Kalyan, Bala Devi Ngangom and Jyoti Chouhan were also on target.Suha Hirani and Kayla Siddiqi scored for Pakistan.India, who are looking to reclaim the SAFF throne after losing it to Bangladesh in 2022, made their intent clear with a powerful display.India took the lead in the 5th minute through Dangmei, who received a low cross from Ranjana Chanu at the edge of the area and rocketed a powerful shot into the back of the net.Kalyan doubled India’s lead in the 17th minute with a superb finish after running into a through pass from Bala Devi.Bala Devi then added India’s third in the 35th minute, smashing an indirect freekick into the top corner.Grace added her individual second seven minutes later with a tight-angled half-volley after Pakistan’s backline failed to clear a cross from Chanu.Pakistan went into the break reducing the deficit to 4-1 from a penalty kick, which was awarded to them after Ashalata Devi brought down Nadia Khan inside the box in the first half injury time. Hirani stepped up and gave India goalkeeper Elangbam Panthoi no chance.The Pakistani were a completely different side after the break and reduced India’s advantage quickly after the restart when Siddiqi found Rameen Fareed’s deflected attempt just outside the six yard box and sent it into the bottom corner.The second goal instilled a sense of an improbable fightback into Pakistan and went close to scoring twice after the hour mark, with Zahmena Malik finding an open chance from close range in the 60th and Amina reaching close to scoring from open play four minutes later. But Pakistan lacked clinical touch and missed both opportunities.Chouhan then punished Pakistan adding their winning goal in the 78th heading in a corner from Dalima Chhibber.India play Bangladesh in their next Group A game on Wednesday.

During the hearing on Thursday, a bench comprising Justices Kumar Regmi and Kumar Chudal directed Ghimire to file a written response within the stipulated time frame.“If there are any grounds for not issuing the order as requested by the petitioner, provide evidence along with a response in writing either personally or through a legal representative within seven days from the date of receiving this notice, in addition to submitting a copy of the petition,” the apex court said.On September 27, the Judicial Council nominated two high court chief judges as Supreme Court justices despite lawyers’ sit-in on the council premises, protesting against the nominations. Ghimire, the NBA president, had criticised the nominations, accusing the council of selecting the two judges in exchange for money.Deputy Registrar Ghimire filed the petition at the court on September 30 demanding legal action against the NBA president. \nTop leaders of Nepal’s three major political parties have agreed to expedite the formation of a search committee to recommend candidates for the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) and the Commission of Investigation on Enforced Disappeared Persons as soon as possible. During a meeting held at the Prime Minister’s residence in Baluwatar, Kathmandu on Thursday, the leaders decided to fast-track the remaining tasks of the peace process.Leaders from the CPN-UML, Nepali Congress and Maoist Centre agreed to form the search committee responsible for selecting officials for the commissions, said Shakti Basnet, a leader from the Maoist Centre. The committee is expected to be finalised at the next Cabinet meeting, scheduled for Friday.“The Cabinet will decide the members of the search committee in its upcoming meeting, accelerating the formation of both the TRC and the Commission of Investigation on Enforced Disappeared Persons,” a source from Baluwatar stated.Earlier in April, the government had formed a five-member committee led by Om Prakash Mishra, a former Chief Justice, to nominate the candidates for both the commissions but it could not do so after the National Human Rights Commission refused to send its representative in the search committee saying that it needs a time-bound commitment from the government to endorse a bill to amend the Enforced Disappearance Enquiry, Truth and Reconciliation Commission Act.Other members of the search committee led by Mishra were former Supreme Court judge Jagadish Sharma Poudel, former ambassador Arjun Karki and human rights activist Stella Tamang and representative of the national human rights commission.“We will recommend the qualified people in the commission so that both the commissions could carry forward the spirit of the peace process, legal procedure and can reach out to all stakeholders and suggest and resolve the issues,” Basnet said. “The search committee will recommend the names for both commissions.”Sources said that former chief justice Mishra will lead the search committee this time as well but the remaining four members besides representation from the National Human Rights Commission will be changed. The search committee was formed as per the Supreme Court’s March 12 order to the government to select office bearers for the two commissions within a month.The court had asked the government to constitute task forces within the commissions to conduct preliminary investigations into the victims’ complaints until the office bearers were appointed.According to the two newly revised Acts related to the truth and reconciliation process, the recommendation committee shall be given two months to make nominations for the chairpersons and members of the two commissions.Prime Minister and CPN-UML Chairman KP Sharma Oli, Nepali Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba and Maoist Centre Chairman Pushpa Kamal Dahal were present at Thursday’s meeting. Other leaders in attendance included Home Minister Ramesh Lekhak, Maoist Centre leader Basnet and Attorney General Ramesh Badal.Basnet added that the meeting agreed to finalise the search committee, which had been initiated during the tenure of his party’s chair Dahal as prime minister.“The meeting to expedite the remaining tasks of the peace process follows the decision made during Maoist Centre chair Dahal’s premiership,” Basnet said. “The parties had agreed to form a search committee to select candidates for the Truth and Reconciliation Commission and the Commission of Investigation on Enforced Disappeared Persons.”Earlier too, the government had formed two commissions to look into the case of truth and reconciliation process and inquiry into disappearances but they failed to achieve the goal. The Truth Commission has received 63,718 complaints, while the commission on disappearances is sitting on around 2,400 cases. The new teams will have four years to accomplish their tasks, though there are provisions for their extension. The commissions that were formed in 2015 have done nothing other than collect complaints and conduct preliminary investigations on some of them.Previously, the government passed a bill related to transitional justice, which was ratified by the President on August 29. The House of Representatives passed the bill on August 14, followed by its approval by the National Assembly on August 22. The two commissions have been paralysed since July 2022 after the government decided to extend their terms without retaining their chairmen and members. \nAmid widespread deaths and devastation caused by monsoon across various districts, Nepal is at a heightened risk for water-borne, vector-borne, and air-borne disease outbreaks.With most water sources contaminated by rain and floodwater, and thousands of displaced people living in makeshift shelters, experts have warned of a potential surge in infections in the coming days.“People are already getting infected with water-borne, vector-borne and air-borne diseases,” said Dr Sher Bahadur Pun, chief of the Clinical Research Unit at Sukraraj Tropical and Infectious Disease Hospital. “These problems could worsen in the coming days.” At least 209 people have been confirmed dead, while 29 others are still missing due to the floods and landslides triggered by record-breaking torrential rainfall that started Thursday evening. Additionally, 142 people have sustained various degrees of injury, and more than 4,222 others have been taken to safe places, the Home Ministry said on Monday evening. Doctors warn that the risk of water-borne, vector-borne and air-borne disease outbreaks increases in the aftermath of disasters. Nepal’s past experiences suggest the same.“People are already contracting cholera and other water-borne diseases,” said Dr Pun. “As displaced people mostly live in temporary shelters, the chances of spread of air-borne and vector-borne diseases remain high.”At least 95 people from various districts, including from Kathmandu and Lalitpur, have tested positive for cholera since the start of the monsoon in June. The Vibrio cholera 01 Ogawa serotype has been confirmed in the stool samples of the infected patients. Thousands of others were also infected with diarrheal infections after the start of the monsoon season. Diarrhoeal disease is a common and seasonal public health issue, usually triggered by unsafe food and water or hygiene issues. Likewise, six people died, and 12,644 others were hospitalised this year due to dengue, which has spread to 76 out of 77 districts across the country. Hundreds of people are contracting seasonal flu, but health authorities have no records of these cases.Officials at the Ministry of Health and Population said that they are bracing for tough days ahead, as the floodwaters not only contaminate drinking water sources but also create breeding grounds for various disease-spreading vectors.“We expect a surge in water-borne, vector-borne and air-borne diseases in the coming days, as it takes a few days for these illnesses to incubate,” said Dr Yadu Chandra Ghimire, director at the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division. “We have alerted all agencies concerned to step up vigilance and prepare to deal with any adverse situations.”Public health experts have warned that healthcare facilities in the disaster-hit districts could witness an uptick in cases of viral fever cases and waterborne diseases—diarrhoea, dysentery, food poisoning—and snakebites.Health Ministry officials say that they are aware of the risks and have directed agencies concerned to prepare accordingly.“We have stockpiled essential medicines in districts, provinces and at the central level,” said Dr Roshan Pokhrel, the secretary at the ministry. “Responding to the looming outbreaks is not only the responsibility of the Health Ministry, but also of other ministries and agencies, and we have been coordinating with them as well.”In addition to stepping up surveillance measures, stockpiling medicines, and deploying medics at the health facilities in disaster-hit areas, public health experts emphasise the importance of health awareness in reducing infections.They say a combination of careful surveys, ensuring safe drinking water, maintaining hygiene and sanitation, social mobilisation and treatment are required to contain the possible outbreaks of various ailments.The monsoon in Nepal is itself a season of epidemics with thousands of people across the country getting infected with water-borne and vector-borne diseases.The country is one of the world’s most vulnerable to the climate crisis and has witnessed extreme weather events over the past decade and a half.Evidence suggests that the maximum temperature in Nepal is rising at a greater rate (0.056 degrees Celsius per year) than the global average of 0.03 degrees Celsius per year.Experts say extreme weather events—excess rainfall in a short period, continuous rains for several days after the monsoon, dry spells, droughts, below-average precipitation, and above-normal winter temperatures—have become more frequent in Nepal.In recent years, scientists have gathered credible evidence linking the climate crisis to adverse health effects that impact the quality of life and kill people. \nAs the festive season approaches, prices of daily essentials like rice, edible oil, legumes, and lentils have increased.Retailers say food prices are expected to stay high throughout Dashain and Tihar, Nepal’s biggest festivals.In Nepal, food prices are heavily influenced by the Indian market. Even though prices have not increased in India, some opportunist traders have been taking advantage of the poor market monitoring to increase prices under different pretexts. For example, on September 14, India raised the basic import tax on crude and refined edible oils by 20 percent. Nepali importers seized this opportunity to hike their prices even though Nepal had not raised the import tax.Dhurba Prasad Adhikari, joint treasurer of the Nepal Retailers Association, said Nepali wholesalers and retailers have already raised the prices. “It has been a week since edible oil price was increased by Rs20 per litre and the price is expected to increase further as the festive demand kicks in,” he said. But he admits that market rumours and weak inspections make prices more unstable, especially during the festive season when demand is at its peak.According to the association, sunflower oil prices have increased from Rs190 to Rs210 per litre. Likewise, the per litre price of mustard oil has gone up from Rs350 to Rs370.Adhikari, who operates Adhikari Khadya Store, said the price of edible oil is expected to increase in Tihar due to high demand.Retailers said strict inspections in large trading houses could help stabilise prices during the festive season. Consumer rights activists say the current government inspections of the market are just for show and will not address issues related to price, quality, and quantity.“The government’s market inspection body is looking only at retail markets. They, too, know this will not change prices unless they also inspect the warehouses of large importers and traders,” Adhikari said. He said that the government inspecting body needs to check on the stock of goods held by traders.According to retailers, even with the new rice harvesting beginning soon, prices of the staple have increased by Rs100 kg for a 25 kg bag.Even the price of sona mansuli, which normally remains at Rs60 per kg, has now inched up to Rs70 to Rs75 per kg.Rice prices, however, are expected to decline after the arrival of the new harvest.Sugar is now being sold at Rs120 per kg and expected to rise further, retailers said.As private sector traders say they are out of sugar stock and both state supply utilities—the Salt Trading Corporation and the Food Management and Trading Company—have delayed opening the tender to import the sweetener, according to market insiders, the price is expected to cross Rs160 per kg by Tihar.However, retailers said the jeera (cumin seed) price has declined. But the price could still go up in the next two weeks.Last year during Dashain, the price of jeera, an indispensable spice, spiked from Rs1,400 to Rs1,500 per kg. The price has declined, and it is being transacted around Rs950 per kg this year, Adhikari said. Prices of lentils and legumes tend to fluctuate based on international production, but have remained high in recent months.According to the association, pulses have reached Rs180 per kg from Rs175 per kg.Adhikari said food prices have been increasing every year. “The rice prices are so high that people are buying only what they need in smaller quantities,” said Adhikari.“The government needs to intervene in the market, particularly inspect the large traders engaged in unscrupulous market activities,” said Prem Lal Maharjan, president of the National Consumer Forum. “Proper inspection will help bring the prices down. It will also help the government bring in more revenues,” he said.As the government has started operating fair-price shops across the country, there might be some relief for consumers, Maharjan said. “But such subsidised shops should be operated year-round to control market prices.”    \nDean Richard Thompson recently completed his two years as the American ambassador to Nepal. Arriving here just before the 2022 elections, he has since closely observed Nepali politics and society. Umesh Chauhan and Biswas Baral recently sat down with Thompson to reflect on his time in Nepal, major US projects in the country including those under the MCC, geopolitical competition with China, trade, and a range of other issues.How have you seen Nepali politics evolve in the two years you have been in the country? What events stood out? I’ve seen a lot of Nepali politics. Obviously, there’s been a lot of changes. I got here right before the national elections in November 2022. It was really great to see the democratic process play out here, to see Nepalis turn out in such great numbers and make their choices known.Democracy is such a vibrant and colourful exercise anywhere in the world. Nepal did not disappoint on that front. It's been fascinating to watch it evolve, to watch the governments come in different formations.What’s been great is the commitment we’ve seen from successive groups in government to moving forward and carrying forward the [bilateral] partnership and building on projects. I’ve also been amazed at some of the innovative things happening in various sectors of the economy.There has been some very exciting work in the IT sector, for example, that runs the gamut from more traditional back-office type operations to cutting-edge AI research, to developing educational apps for school students, to things like what we have been sponsoring at our Content Creator’s Mela these past two years. It is great to see Nepalis show lots of creativity in expressing themselves and talking about their culture and their society in so many different ways. Across the board, I’d say the experience has been unique.How have the Nepal-US relations evolved over the past 77 years of diplomatic ties? What are the salient features of the relationship? What I would say is we’ve always tried to listen, to engage with the Nepali society. Based on that, I think one of the things that we’ve done is refine the range of products.The Peace Corps, the USAID, the Millennium Challenge Corporation, the Development Finance Corporation, or other elements of our assistance and development commitments—these are different tools that can be employed. And Nepal has continually expanded its capacity to take advantage of them. The US has been able to increase the number of tools and assets, if you will, that Nepal can use to build its economy.I’m very proud of the fact that we have done this primarily through grant-based assistance, so that there is little in terms of downsides. At the same time, we have focused on different segments of the economy or society, for example, through the Development Finance Corporation, we’re now able to target and work with the financial sector to create more opportunities for small and medium-sized enterprises, particularly women-run enterprises. Through the USAID, we can use more of the traditional mechanisms of assistance.The Millennium Challenge Corporation kind of speaks for itself. It targets large-scale, massive infrastructure type projects that aim to be transformative in terms of Nepal’s economy. It has helped grow the road and infrastructure network and show new technology that can help expand that network and make roads safer, more reliable, and easier to maintain. It has helped build an electricity infrastructure that allows Nepal, first and foremost, to internally use the green hydropower that's at its disposal, but there will be excess capacity even to export it to the region to earn additional income. So I’m pretty excited about what I’ve seen happen over the past 77 years, and where we are today. I’m also extremely positive about building on where we are now. Can you give us a status of the implementation of projects under the Millennium Challenge Account Nepal? In the MCC, energy, obviously, is a high-priority area and so is transportation. Where we are with the projects themselves is we have let out the contracts for the sub-stations, for the 18-kilometre cross-border transmission line, and we have reissued the tender for the 297-kilometre broader transmission line package that had to be revised due to some cost changes over the time it took to implement that piece of the package.But we’re pretty positive about getting that back on track by the end of the year and putting the project firmly on the right footing for a five-year completion timeline. But there have also been hurdles, right? Do you still expect the transmission lines and road projects to be completed in five years?I expect there to be more hurdles. The biggest challenge was when the bids came back for the 297-kilometre transmission line. We had a number of delays there from Covid to worldwide inflation, to supply chain shifts that I don’t think people had foreseen completely. I’m not surprised. But the MCC has had a lot of experience around the world with these projects.It builds into this assumption that there will be challenges, there will be situations that need to be rethought and overcome. The real trick is making sure we move forward in a way that’s smart and focused on keeping things on time and on track. We're fortunate in the case of Nepal because we have a partner that has so heavily invested its own resources into the project.We have our $500 million grant and Nepal is putting in almost $200 million. It’s been made a national pride project. Look, other things will inevitably come up. But we believe that we have a good team that’s ready to tackle those types of challenges and press forward.At the end of the day, this can serve as a really positive model for how development assistance and how large-scale infrastructure projects can be implemented in a partnership that is largely the result of an internal domestic process. Don’t forget, Nepal requested the MCC project. The government of Nepal, through a consultative process, developed the idea, designed the project, and is now its lead implementer.We’re a financier and a partner but it is very much a Nepal-owned effort. Talking about challenges, there are many local governments and we have to deal with them every 10 to 15 kilometres in the project areas. Different communities have different concerns and priorities. This can add to some difficulty.What do you think will happen to the project if it cannot meet the five-year deadline?The fate of the project is to be completed in its entirety in five years. I can't speak to whether there’s going to be a particular challenge to delay it by six months or seven months or something like that. Right now, in our planning and projection, we hope that we can move it forward within the timeline.If it needs to go beyond that, we’ll work closely with our partner and figure it out. I’m confident that the $500 million that the US government is providing will be spent within the five years and it will lay a firm foundation for the completion of the project.But coming back to your scenario, indeed, you have different communities. A lot of people are affected by this. Now, on the one hand, that's why we encourage and insist on a consultative process, on everything being as transparent as possible so people know exactly what’s going to happen, that they know what the money is being spent on, what the effects will be in terms of how many trees will have to be cut down or what roads will be built where. That’s very important to us: no surprises for the communities that are out there.I think that we will rely on a lot of that effort to help us propel the project forward if things do get challenging on other fronts as well.Like you said, the project does need to be completed by a deadline of five years. Just in case it doesn’t, what happens?Look, it is an ambitious undertaking. There’s no question about it, right? And the Millennium Challenge Corporation is committed to making it happen within that five-year period. The MCA Nepal is committed to making it happen within that five-year period. But they’re also working closely together to make sure that it’s being done in a proper way, in a transparent way, and I’m confident that we will be able to complete what we need to complete. I’m also sure there’s a firm commitment from the government that if there’s a little piece left over here or there, to make sure it goes forward.I don’t worry about the ultimate completion of the project. I’m more focused on how we get it going as quickly as possible, because just the implementation of the project itself should employ close to 10,000 Nepalis, right? I really want communities to start to see the benefit of the project as soon as possible, because that’s where the transformative nature of it comes into play. Part of it is building it. Part of it is implementing it. Part of it is learning from that process. But then having this infrastructure in place, that’s what really changes the dynamic in Nepal and in the economic well-being of the country.Some fear that a failure to complete the project on time could even create rifts in our bilateral ties.I don’t think they should be fearful. We are partners in this, and if there’s any issue, if we're going to work through it together. What we should be doing is focusing entirely on implementing the project to its fullest potential as quickly as possible.Let’s move to geopolitics. What we see in the region is seemingly an exclusivist India-China geopolitical competition. Indians appear reluctant to work with the regimes that work closely with China. It's almost like they are saying, it's either the Chinese or us. How do you see this geopolitical dynamics playing out in Nepal? And where do the Americans fit in this picture?Yeah, it’s a good question in terms of the dynamic that’s in play today and where things are headed. We have of course been watching the India-China relationship and its development over the past few years with some degree of concern. Obviously, there was conflict there some years ago, and I think they’ve been trying to manage that since.And there’s no question that other countries in the region feel that very powerfully. From our standpoint, what we would like to see is the countries of the region—and particularly Nepal because that’s where I’m accredited and that’s where I have some level of knowledge—exercise their sovereignty and to have the space that they need to make decisions about they own future on behalf of their people in a positive way.We don’t believe countries should be asked to choose. We fully expect that Nepal is going to have good relations with India and China. They’re two neighbours. They’re large countries. They’re important countries in the region. It’s critically important for Nepal that it works with and benefits from both India and China.At the same time, we see no reason that should have any effect on our relationship with Nepal, and no reason Nepal should not be fully able to take full advantage of what the US has to offer. We will continue to watch and continue to work closely with Nepal as a partner and to encourage it to exercise its sovereignty and its decision-making in a way that benefits the Nepali people. The US-China relations are also very dicey at the moment. Surely this has some effect on how the US perceives the Chinese role around the world, including in Nepal.We had a recent high-level visit by our National Security Advisor [to China]. We’ve had recent visits by the Secretary of State, the Secretary of Commerce, the Secretary of Treasury. I think there’s a real effort to try to manage what we all acknowledge is as a competition that’s underway, in a way that’s positive and can maybe move us more towards some type of cooperative element.That channel should continue to be pursued by the US and China, but it’s not reflective of our relationship with Nepal, or our relationship with India. This is about what we can do together [with Nepal]. I’m not going to comment on what other countries may be saying about us, how they may be trying to influence us.I would commit to us remaining as transparent as possible so Nepalis can make their own decisions about what's happening by our relationship.Recently, the Americans were blamed for ousting Sheikh Hasina from Bangladesh. The US is also often accused of meddling in the domestic affairs of other South Asian states, and in other parts of the world for that matter. How do you respond to this accusation?First off, I think you’ve got to take with a grain of salt anything that’s being said by someone who’s been forced to flee their country. The United States simply does not meddle in the internal politics of other countries. We work very hard to be as transparent as we possibly can about our relationships, about what we’re doing, about what we intend.That’s not to say that if we disagree vehemently with a country about a certain policy or a certain issue, we won’t raise it. But this idea that the US would find some benefit in enacting a change in government like that, it simply isn’t part of our repertoire of diplomacy. What we rather look to do is build the strongest relationships that we can.We love to do that primarily through people-to-people relationships and sponsoring as much development opportunity as we possibly can with our partner countries. So, I put no stock in these types of rumours and statements.There is also this sentiment that the Americans and the Indians are increasingly working together on strategic issues, and the same is seen even in South Asia.Certainly, there’s been a huge growth in the strategic partnership between the US and India. I think we want to see that continue to move forward in a positive way. At the same time, there have been disagreements between the US and India on various fronts, just as we have disagreements with many of our partners. And we try to deal with those in a proactive, professional and productive way.But, again, we see our relationship with each individual country through a bilateral lens. So if there are ways that the US and India working together can be beneficial, and another country agrees to such a cooperation, fine. But when it comes to Nepal, we’re going to base our relationship and our efforts first and foremost on our bilateral discussions and our bilateral relationship.Even as we speak, the US and Nepali armies are undertaking joint training in Nepal. How would you characterise the relations between the two armies?Yeah, the PAC ANGEL exercise is going on, focused on disaster relief, humanitarian assistance. The relationship between the two militaries has been strong, it remains strong, and I think it will continue to be strong primarily because we focus it on the areas Nepal wants to focus on—which is building a Nepal army that is capable of responding to disasters, providing humanitarian assistance, and then serving as part of the global peacekeeping network through the United Nations as the largest contributor force of peacekeepers. It’s in our interest to see Nepal continue to professionalise and develop its capacity on those fronts. That’s where our focus is, and that’s where we will continue to make efforts.There has also been a lot of debate in Nepal on the Indo-Pacific Strategy (IPS) and its applicability to South Asia. What is the current state of its application?The Indo-Pacific Strategy is a broad, big strategy by the United States government about how it looks at the entire region. And so it’s about how we create an open, independent, sovereign Indo-Pacific region for the benefit of all the people in the region.What we will continue to do is employ it to build relationships we have with each of the countries in the region. How can we continue to support democratic development? How can we continue to support economic development? Let’s not forget a huge portion, maybe 60 percent of the world’s commerce transits the Indo-Pacific corridor in some way, shape, or form every year.It’s in everyone’s interest for that to remain open and free. And for the countries of the region to be able to act in a sovereign way in their own interests.There is also a sizable section of Nepalis who believe that the IPS was brought with the intent of countering China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), and that Nepal is struggling to find a balance between the two. What is your reading?The USAID, the MCC, the Development Finance Corporation, all of our development programmes have a singular purpose, which is to work with our bilateral partners to grow their economies, to make them more able to meet the needs of their people. That’s the goal. That's how they were designed. And that’s how we will continue to treat them.The BRI is China's initiative. It’s pushing that forward. It’s up to each country to decide how it wants to engage with others. We believe the model of, say, a USAID or an MCC is proving itself to be beneficial to countries, as they are grant-based and economic growth oriented. We’ll continue to push them because we think the data and historical experience we’ve had support them.I think it’s incumbent on us to try to help all of our partners relate to us as equals in any realm that we’re working together. That’s critically important and something we have to acknowledge and something we have to make sure that they’re able to acknowledge.It's about building trust, about showing that our intent is correct, that we have the best interest of our partners in mind, and that we’re applying the same and transparent standards universally.For example, on the MCC, we’ve published everything on the internet. If anybody in Nepal has a question about any aspect of the project, they can go to the website, they can read about the project, they can see the blueprints, they can know exactly what it’s going to involve. That's how I think we build relationships.I think if I came to Nepal and said, hey, I want to do X project because I want to counter this country, I don’t think I would get very good reception. We just don’t look at the world that way. It’s not a healthy approach in the long run.But a bilateral focus that seeks to empower the people of a country—that’s where I think we have the best chance of moving forward. Nepal’s Parliament has finally passed an amendment to the transitional justice law. How does the US see this development? How do you see the transitional justice process progressing?I think this is a really important step in the process. I would say that we remain positive about the way it's going and we are looking to see how we can help. You noted, I’m sure, that we joined a number of other partner countries in issuing a statement of support after the Parliament passed it.We all know bringing a conflict of this scale to conclusion is always going to be a challenge. The TJ legislation has passed, which was a tough hurdle, but implementation will also be difficult.We’re looking forward to figuring out how we can be supportive, and how other partners can be supportive. Some of that may be through bilateral means. Some of it may be through multilateral means.But what I remain encouraged about, in particular, is, we’ve always said this needs to be a Nepali-run process. It has been. That it needs to be victim-centric. I believe that it is. And so we need to make sure the consultative piece of this remains alive as you move to implementation, so that the victims groups, so that the child soldier groups, so that other entities that have been involved continue to have a voice and continue to work together to figure out how to resolve this, to make reparations work, to bring justice in those cases. And so, we are positive.Thousands of Nepali youths are leaving the country every single day in search of better jobs. In this light, do you see the prospect of greater American FDI helping Nepal build a more robust economy that can create enough good jobs?I do. At the beginning of the interview, I talked about some sectors of the economy that are quite exciting right now. I think you’re seeing a lot of interest from the US in the IT sector, the tourism sector, in the health sector, and in the energy sector as it continues to develop.We’re very keen to look for ways to bring more US investment here, whether it’s through equity sort of vehicles, or direct bilateral investments. I think that can also be positive. I think Nepal did a good job in setting up that April Investment Summit. That sent a really positive signal. You’ll recall that we had a representative from the US Chamber of Commerce, Atul Keshap, come out for that. We’ve had a great run of senior US visitors out here over the last year and a half.I think the key right now is for Nepal, through its private sector, through its government, to figure out how to make the environment for investment in Nepal as attractive as it can possibly be. In this interview, we’ve talked about the idea of competition between countries. One place where I will absolutely acknowledge there’s competition is in trying to attract investment.And so Nepal needs to figure out how to make itself as attractive as possible, and how to make it as easy as possible to do business. That helps not only investments that come from other countries, but makes it easier for Nepalis to start businesses, right? It makes it easier for Nepalis to operate and do what they want. And so, in addition to welcoming, say, US companies or British companies or Canadian companies, we would also love to see Nepalis who have gone abroad come back and start to help in building the economy here.We’ve seen how capable and how dynamic they are in building other people’s economies. Let’s do the same here at home.I mentioned that the trade and investment framework talks that we have with Nepal are in their seventh round. I look forward to, in the rest of my tenure here, to continue to build the momentum that will allow investment to take shape and the economy here to thrive. \nHere’s what Prime Minister KP Oli told the parliament on Monday, saying he was giving the address for a “special” reason: “Nepal wants to maintain neighbourly relations as a good neighbour, not a petty, scheming neighbour…Nepal wants a similar behaviour on the part of its neighbours.”He pursued this line of argument, implying that India is wishing ill on Nepal, imposing on Nepal’s sovereignty and interfering in its independent status and policy. He then told the parliament that he would present the issue at the United Nations General Assembly.It basically amounts to saying he will complain to the UN about India’s behaviour. What a petty idea.Given his inherent character trait, PM Oli will find it difficult to develop trusted relations with India in the short term. His only option is to be diplomatic, predictable and consistent. So far, he’s not been able to do that. It does not bode well for Nepal’s foreign policy, which is the most important means of pursuing Nepal’s current priorities, including jobs, growth and climate change.Calculated relations Oli’s statement in the parliament indicates at least three things. First, his expectations from India have not been fulfilled. Second, his communications with the country have broken down. And third, he thinks India may be working to undermine his political authority.Let’s look at his expectations from the southern neighbour. Oli wants to hold high-level talks with PM Modi of India and build trusted relations.In the past two weeks, media reports and opinion pieces have discussed whether Oli would be invited to India or not. It has almost become customary in Nepal for a new prime minister to visit India first before embarking on other high-level visits. Such a custom indicates the value politicians accord to India, especially if they want their government to be stable.The second indication is that Oli is finding it difficult to communicate with people who matter in India. When you begin to communicate your feelings about India through the media, it indicates that your direct communications have either broken down or are ineffective.Behind Oli’s statement is an obvious intention to play the blame game or rally the public. India may be at fault for many things, but blaming India does not absolve him of inconsistencies on his part or the sheer inability to conduct diplomacy in a dignified manner.The third indication is even more significant. Oli has consistently promoted anti-Indian nationalism, and India finds it difficult to trust him. But would that alone be enough to undermine his government?Throughout history, India has had a significant influence on Nepal’s political process and decision-making. Through its influence on individuals who’ve received gifts, benefits, and resources, some at the highest levels, India holds significant leverage over political decision-making and, by extension, over policies and processes.An old playbookIndia’s calculated relations with the Nepali state came to the fore in August this year when Foreign Minister Arzu Rana Deuba visited India. New Delhi turned her visit into a high-profile affair even though she was unprepared to represent Nepal’s interests. Her visit, rather than building political trust, ended up creating more mistrust between Oli and New Delhi as well as between the Foreign Ministry and the Prime Minister’s Office.Although it is a matter of speculation, there are strong grounds to argue that such a courtesy would not have been extended to someone from the CPN (UML). It generates the question, at least in the public’s mind, whether India accorded special treatment to FM Rana as a “special” individual who happened to be the foreign minister and not as a representative of Nepal.Whether real or not, the perception that India is unhappy with Oli has fuelled the notion that the current government coalition is unstable.Throughout Nepal’s modern history, whenever top leaders are forced out, they tend to seek India’s support to regain power. I have heard firsthand from top political leaders that India used to put a pre-condition: First, demonstrate that you have people's support, then we will use our leverage to help you. Thus, the political leaders would launch a political campaign and hold mass meetings throughout the country. If the broader political environment favoured a political change, then India made the additional push.Now, as Pushpa Kamal Dahal tours the country, blaming a corrupt network of power brokers, we are reminded of this old playbook. During mass meetings, an embittered Dahal frequently alleges that “middlemen, brokers, and big cronies have gotten together, and with the strength of so-called numbers, have tried to strangle truth, justice…and good governance.” He also tells the public that his government was ousted because the investigations on corruption were leading to Budhanilkantha (Deuba’s residence) and Balkot (Oli’s residence).Oli’s inherent anti-Indian streakFor Oli, an inherent anti-Indian streak in his psychological make-up and an affinity with the Communist Party of China makes rapprochement with India difficult.In the last 10 years, Oli has made countless petty statements intended to rile and irritate India. He has also accorded China greater space in Nepal.In his book, former deputy PM Kamal Thapa expresses distaste at the way Oli made an unscheduled visit to China Gezhouba Group Corporation and disappeared for one and a half hours for a private meeting with Chinese Communist Party officials during his visit to China in 2016.Another issue is the Eminent Persons’ Group report, which Oli raised during the launch of Thapa’s book. “It would be good to receive the report,” he said during the programme. He made more anti-Indian remarks at another similar event.At present, any talk of the EPG report is viewed as an irritant by India, because it has consistently sent a clear diplomatic message that the report is dead. The unwillingness of a section of the Nepali populace to accept the message, including the CPN-UML, has not gone well in India.In a recent discussion programme, a former ambassador of India to Nepal indicated that the EPG report had become a new irritant in Nepal-India relations. He said that instead of insisting on the acceptance of the report, Nepal could pursue the individual issues identified. Trends in the last two decades indicate that instead of really trying to address the outstanding issues in Nepal-India relations, Nepali leaders are just interested in politicising them and gaining personal mileage.Nepal’s relationship with India has become more and more of a paradox. Nepal’s dominant ethno-nationalism is anti-Indian. Indeed, Nepal has many unresolved issues with India, but it’s economic development hinges on closer connectivity with India, which in turn hinges on trusted political relationships and ability to untangle complex issues.Snubbed by India, Oli is now headed to the US, where he could still get to meet a lukewarm Modi. He hopes to gain stature and make an impression at several forums including the UNGA, where he is scheduled to deliver speeches. We can only wish our PM well. \nFive years ago, on September 30, 2019, when KP Sharma Oli was prime minister for the second time, the government declared the entire country open-defecation free amid much fanfare. However, years later, thousands of people from across the country are getting infected with diarrheal diseases, including scores from cholera.Rautahat is among the nine districts reporting cholera outbreaks this year. Ward 4 of Rajpur Municipality has reported over 100 cases of diarrheal infection and hospitalisation. However, the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division said only 12 people from the municipality had so far contracted cholera.“Over 100 diarrheal patients from the municipality’s ward 4 have been hospitalised,” Khusid Ahmad, a health worker at the municipality, told the Post over the phone from Rautahat. “Contaminated drinking water could be the culprit for the cholera outbreak there. Samples of drinking water collected from affected areas have been sent for lab tests.”Apart from Rautahat, eight other districts—Lalitpur, Kathmandu, Kailali, Pyuthan, Makawanpur, Rolpa, Sindhupalchok, and Achham—have also reported cholera outbreaks this year. So far, the number of diarrheal patients who have contracted cholera is 95. Interestingly, most of the districts that have witnessed outbreaks of deadly cholera this year had years ago been declared open defecation-free.The Vibrio cholera 01 Ogawa serotype has been confirmed in the stool samples of the infected patients. Doctors say that detected cases of cholera infection could be just the tip of the iceberg, as most positive cases are being reported from the districts with active surveillance.Public health experts say outbreaks of cholera in multiple districts, even five years after the country was declared open defecation-free, show a huge gap between official declarations and progress on the ground.They say outbreaks of diarrheal diseases, including cholera, are directly linked to drinking water, sanitation, and hygiene conditions, and the country was declared open defecation-free without improving water and sanitation conditions.“Without ensuring the quality of drinking water and sanitation, among other things, authorities rushed to declare the entire country free from open defecation,” said Dr Mingmar Gyelgen Sherpa, former director general at the Department of Health Services. “Instead of improving basic water and sanitation infrastructure, we’ve focussed too much on outbreak management, and this is the wrong approach.”Even though toilets have been built in most households, open defecation is still widespread in many places. Drinking water samples collected from various parts of the country, including from the districts of the Kathmandu Valley, have been found contaminated with faecal coliform, which means the water the public uses for drinking is unsafe. The presence of faecal coliform, a microscopic organism that thrives in the intestines of warm-blooded animals or their faeces, indicates sewage contamination in the drinking water, according to doctors.A previous study had shown that 81 percent of water samples collected in the Kathmandu Valley were contaminated with deadly microbes.“We only focussed on expanding coverage of drinking water but did not pay attention to ensuring its safety,” said Dr Meghnath Dhimal, chief researcher at the Nepal Health Research Council. “Authorities concerned must also focus on improving the quality.”Experts say improving public hygiene is essential to ensuring water quality and avoiding diarrheal ailments. Awareness drives and health education play a crucial role in changing behaviours, which requires years of investment and continuous efforts.Along with investment in health education, attention should go to building climate-resilient infrastructures for drinking water and sanitation, as water resources have been contaminated by floodwaters in many districts. The effects of climate change have increased adverse events, including floods, which in turn have contaminated the source of drinking water, making people vulnerable to infection with diarrheal ailments.“Multiple agencies of the three tiers of government and non-governmental sectors have to make more effort to prevent diarrhoea outbreaks,” said Sherpa. “But there seems to be a lack of coordination among government agencies.” The World Health Organisation also stresses on a multifaceted approach as a key to controlling cholera and reducing deaths. \n\n\nRae was the envoy to Kathmandu during the promulgation of the 2015 constitution and the subsequent blockade. In this conversation, Rae talks about the evolution of Nepal-India ties since the blockade, regional geopolitics, what the two countries get wrong about each other, how New Delhi views Nepali communist parties and the governments they lead, and the change (if any) in India’s neighbourhood policy since the start of Narendra Modi’s third term in office. \nKunwar, a former Amazon executive, has led Daraz Nepal as MD for three years, discussing challenges and opportunities in Nepal's e-commerce and business landscape.\n‘Kanchhi’, by author Weena Pun, explores themes relevant to Nepali women's struggles in a socio-political context inspired by her journalistic background.\nAmidst controversy, CPN-UML accepts land donation from imprisoned businessman Gurung, raising concerns about corruption and a conflict of interest.\nChairman of the CPN (Maoist Centre) accuses the Nepali Congress, CPN-UML, and former monarch of fueling a political crisis by forming a government that aims to revise the constitution, including provisions for republicanism and inclusiveness.\nThe Maoist Centre has opened up electoral alliances with progressive parties other than the Nepali Congress and CPN-UML for upcoming byelections, while announcing a directive for candidate selection through consensus or majority vote at the ward level.\nThe Nepali Congress is holding a ‘100-day campaign’ to rejuvenate party committees, strengthen the bond between the party's local representatives and central leaders, and pacify the party's dissenters.The party’s central committee meeting, which concluded on September 1, decided to run the 100-day campaign from September 23 to December 31. Krishna Prasad Paudel, chief secretary at the party office, says many central leaders have already reached the districts they are assigned to run campaign activities.According to Paudel, the party’s seven joint general secretaries lead the campaign in the seven provinces. Senior leaders Krishna Sitaula, Shashank Koirala, Bimalendra Nidhi, and Bijaya Kumar Gachhadar, along with some central committee leaders, have either reached the assigned districts or are on the way, Paudel said.“When the party’s senior leaders and central committee members are in their districts, vice presidents and general secretaries of the party will monitor the campaign activities,” Paudel told the Post. “If necessary, the vice presidents, the general secretaries, and the party president will go to some districts.”One of the main objectives of the campaign is to renew party membership. “We claim our party has 0.9 million members,” Paudel said. “During the campaign, leaders will check the trend of party members renewing their membership.”The campaign has been launched at a time when leaders have already started to devise their plans for the next general convention. As per the Congress statute, the party must hold its general convention every four years. The party’s 14th general convention was held in December 2021. If the statute is followed, the party’s next convention should be convened by the end of 2025.Some Congress leaders have floated the proposal of contesting the next general election on its own, without forging electoral alliance with other parties. General Secretary Gagan Thapa floated a proposal to this effect at the Mahasamiti meeting in February that forwarded the proposal to the central committee to take a decision on the issue.“If we are to fight elections on our own [without an alliance], we need a strong organisation, therefore the party is emphasising strengthening the party by conducting campaigns,” Paudel told the Post.But, for the party leaders, success of the campaign will largely depend on the way it will be run.“Will the party leaders try to connect the party organisation to the public or will they conduct it in just a traditional manner? This will determine the success of the campaign,” Guru Ghimire, a Congress leader, told the Post.Ghimire suggested that the party leaders should also gauge the strengths and weaknesses of other parties in the districts.Ghimire also advised the leaders not to use the campaign as an opportunity to promote factional activities.When public disenchantment towards the major parties is growing fast, the campaign the Congress has decided to carry forward could be a means to connect the leaders with the public, says a Congress leader.“This campaign will re-energise the relations between the party and the public, and the party should work hard to make this event fruitful without baggage of internal factions,” Sanjay Kumar Gautam, a Congress lawmaker, told the Post.Reconnecting with the public is a compulsion for the political parties, say political experts. Soon after the November 2022 election, major political parties including the Congress held several campaigns to reconnect with the people but the masses may not be quite impressed by the leaders’ announcements they make during the rallies unless they deliver when in power. Earlier, the CPN-UML carried out various drives such as ‘mission grassroots’, a march along Mid-Hill Highway. “Political parties’ efforts to get connected with the people is something commendable in itself,” Geja Sharma Wagle, a political analyst close to the Congress, told the Post. “But, if the political parties don’t deliver while they are in government, people might not be convinced by their pledges.”Wagle adds that as the Congress is in government, people take the leaders’ speeches seriously only if they work for them sincerely.During the 100-day campaign, the party has decided to inform the party members and local leaders regarding the seven-point agreement reached between the Congress and the CPN-UML on July 1. Based on the same agreement, the two parties formed the coalition government led by UML chair KP Sharma Oli on July 15. As per the deal, Oli will hand over the government leadership to Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba after two years.Besides their power-sharing in the federal government, the Congress and the UML have shared powers in provincial governments as well. While Koshi, Lumbini and Karnali provincial governments are led by the UML, Congress provincial lawmakers head Bagmati, Gandaki, and Sudurpaschim governments. The two big parties have backed Janamat Party to head the provincial government in Madhesh.During a meeting of the coalition partners held in Singha Durbar on September 9, Prime Minister Oli had reportedly complained that the coalition partners did not work enough to counter the ‘disinformation campaign of the opposition parties’ against the Oli government. “The opposition has spread confusion about the government, but the parties in government have not shown any interest in countering the disinformation,” the prime minister had reportedly said at the meeting. “All the ruling partners should defend the government.”Congress leaders will inform the party’s district representatives about the spirit of collaboration with the UML, constitutional amendments, and other issues. They are also responsible for informing the party members at the grassroots about policies such as the common minimum programme.Earlier this month, the Congress-UML coalition brought the programme that has, among other things, reiterated its commitment to reviewing the achievements made and weaknesses observed in the course of implementing the constitution in the past nine years. \nTicket bookings for public transport during the Dashain festival will open this Saturday. Following discussions with stakeholders, the Department of Transport Management announced that tickets will be available online and at counters to manage the expected surge of nearly two million travellers leaving the Kathmandu Valley for the festivities.According to the department’s Director General, Rajiv Pokharel, transport operators will facilitate online bookings. “We have instructed operators to arrange online bookings wherever possible,” he said. “For counter bookings, passengers must obtain tickets only from official staff wearing uniforms and identification badges.”Around two million people are estimated to leave the Kathmandu Valley during Dashain. The department has introduced 20-point directives to ensure safe and hassle-free travel. Key measures include mandatory checks for alcohol consumption by drivers at major entry and exit points and the requirement for two drivers on long-distance routes. Additionally, those under 18 cannot work as assistant drivers.To assist travellers during Dashain, Tihar, and Chhath festivals, citizen help desks will be established at major locations such as Nagdhunga, Kalanki, Swayambhu, Halchowk, Machhapokhari, Gongabu Bus Park, Chabahil, Tilganga, Koteshwar, Jagati, Satdobato, Balkhu, Dakshinkali, Sundhara, and Sangha in Kavre. An inspection team comprising officials from various agencies will monitor travel arrangements with support from provincial transport ministries.Public transport operating on long and medium-distance routes must follow a designated queue system. Transport expert Ashish Gajurel noted that although bookings are open each year, passengers face difficulties. \"Bus operators don’t increase the number of buses during Dashain, despite rising demand. Authorities must increase the number of buses to ease travel,\" he said.Saroj Sitaula, senior vice-president of the Federation of Nepalese National Transport Entrepreneurs, however, argued that ‘unnecessary’ vehicle checks should be avoided to prevent inconvenience for passengers and drivers. He also highlighted the need to repair potholes on roads to ensure smooth travel.Earlier, Minister for Physical Infrastructure and Transport Devendra Dahal instructed the Department of Roads to complete road repairs nationwide before Ghatasthapana, the first day of the 15-day Dashain festival. The department reported that repairs are underway but have been delayed by the monsoon.The Narayanghat-Butwal road section, part of the East-West Highway, remains a major concern, with only 52.7 percent of its upgrade completed after six years of construction and multiple deadline extensions. The Meteorological Forecasting Division of the Department of Hydrology and Meteorology has predicted chances of rainfall in various places of the country for a couple of days more, raising concerns about travel difficulties during Dashain. Other problematic sections include Nagdhunga-Mugling and Mugling-Pokhara, with landslides and potholes reported along various highways, including the Mid-Hill, Madan Bhandari, Hulaki, and BP highways. \nPanic gripped locals in ward 12 of Chandragiri Municipality, Kathmandu, on Thursday morning after a suspicious object was found in the locality.The suspicious object was spotted in front of Balambu Secondary School, sparking fears of a bomb threat.Locals informed the police, and a bomb disposal team from the Nepal Army arrived at the scene. According to the NA Directorate of Public Relations and Information, the team disposed of the suspicious object, which turned out to be a pressure cooker.   \nKathmandu Metropolitan City has extended the area to prohibit building any structure on either side of the rivers in its territory.In a notice on Wednesday, the city office stated that construction of any structure has been barred on the additional 20 meters from the existing prohibited area.According to the metropolis notice, if the city has, under the existing rule, prohibited any construction on 20 meters from the area marked as river, the prohibited area will now be altogether 40 meters on either side of the waterway.The metropolis said the decision was taken based on a recent Supreme Court verdict that directed the authorities concerned to prohibit construction within an additional 20 metres from riverbanks in the Kathmandu Valley.Currently, construction is permitted only 20 metres beyond major riverbanks in the Kathmandu metropolis.The notice issued by the metropolis states, “No construction will be permitted on an additional 20 metres of land on either side of the river, and ongoing construction will be halted.”It has also asked one and all not to release contaminated water, including sewage, into Bagmati River and its tributaries. “Private and government buildings, as well as commercial properties, must install soak pits for groundwater recharge,” it said. “Waste must not be disposed of in the rivers. Non-compliance will lead to legal action under existing laws.” \nThe rhythmic beat of the Dha echoes through a Bhaktapur alley, blending with the energetic footsteps of dancers. Bhaktapur, which sees jatras and festivals round the year, is no stranger to music, dance and celebrations. But this is not an ordinary occasion. The performers in question are Lakhe dancers who are reviving the Ranjitkar Lakhe dance after a century.The young dancers are preparing for Indra Jatra this year, where mask-clad Lakhe dancers roam the streets to rid the community of hardships and suffering. Lakhe, demon deities revered as protectors of people and crops, are thought to reside in the demonic mask. As the dancer dons the mask, the spirit is said to take over.Bhaktapur was once a key site for the Ranjitkar Lakhe performances, but the art form vanished from the city after the 1934 earthquake.“Bhaktapur suffered the most damage during the 1934 earthquake,\" says Ganesh Ram Ranjit, treasurer of the Ranjitkar Group’s Bhaktapur branch. “The destruction left residents struggling to recover for a decade, making it nearly impossible to perform the costly Lakhe dance.”The Ranjitkar Group discovered the extinct dance in the year the group was established. They located a Lakhe temple in Bhaktapur that had closed after the earthquake. After two years of research, they learned that performing the Lakhe dance was seen as a good omen in Bhaktapur and involved hosting community feasts. However, the high cost of this tradition forced many to sell their properties, rendering it unfeasible in the city’s post-earthquake conditions. Over time, the dance was abandoned as more lands supporting these cultural events were lost during rapid urbanisation.“There was a significant decline in our engagement with our cultural heritage,” says Rabi Shakya, a sculptor and Lakhe dance teacher training the new dancers. “The encouraging change now is the strong interest from the new generation, which is making it possible to revive intangible heritage like this dance.”After 100 years, the Ranjitkar Lakhe Dance is making a return to Bhaktapur at this year’s Indra Jatra.“It’s challenging to accurately re-enact the dance since it hasn’t been seen in a century,” Shakya notes. “As a sculptor, I drew inspiration from Bhaktapur’s revered Shree Navadurga Bhawani to create the Lakhe’s mask.” Similarly, the dance was choreographed by studying Lakhe dances from Kathmandu, Patan, and Banepa within the Ranjitkar community, and combining them with traditional steps from Bhaktapur Lakhe dances.“As for the musical instruments, we are using traditional instruments like Dha, Dhime, and Ponga, which are said to excite the Lakhe,” says Rajendra Maharjan, Lakhe dance teacher and musician.Maharjan is one of the experienced Newari arts teachers working to revive the lost Lakhe dance. He is involved in training young students in cultural arts and is now dedicated to the Ranjitkar dance training, with the students practising together nearly every day.“Becoming a Lakhe performer involves more than just wearing the costume and mask,” said Sudin Ranjit, a Lakhe dance student. “We must train extensively with our teachers, and it demands a lot of hard work.”To Ranjit, a resident of Bhaktapur, the training is more than learning a new craft; it is a matter of protecting culture. Growing up only interested in instruments, he slowly understood how important continuing cultural practices like Lakhe dances is for their community.“The dance will not only bolster Bhaktapur’s cultural pride but also boost tourism and create jobs,” says Dr Purushottam Lochan Shrestha, a professor and researcher specialising in Bhaktapur and Newari culture.Shrestha notes that reviving the dance would offer employment to everyone involved, from the dancers and the sculptor making the masks to those participating in the rituals. “Economic centres throughout the city, from small businesses to large industries, will benefit from the influx of tourists attracted by the Lakhe dance,” Shrestha adds, commending the Ranjitkar group's initiative.Once the Ranjitkar community revitalises the Lakhe dance, the Ranjitkar group plans to set up a new Guthi house with a fresh community fund and organise annual events for the dance.“The Lakhe dance won’t let them separate,” Shakya remarks.In today’s globalised world, where identity often merges into a homogenised blend, shared cultural practices provide a sense of connection and belonging. This new Lakhe dance embodies that spirit of togetherness for the community involved.“Reviving the dance after 100 years,” Shakya says, “is about preserving our culture for the next 300 years.” \nThe Lions Club of Kathmandu Corporate, Nepal MD325-D has felicitated various personalities as part of its endeavour to recognise the contribution of the individuals and business entities for the society.As part of its campaign, the Lions Club of Kathmandu honoured Prateek Pradhan with Social Journalism Award, Sylapa T Rimponche with Social Spiritual Award, Erika Gurung with Social Player Award, Ramesh Corporation with Social Corporate House Award, Rajendra Malla with Social Corporate Leader Award and Rajesh Hamal with Social Celebrity Award.Likewise, Chandra Ghimire is honoured with Social Bureaucratic Award, Binod Das with Sports Management Award, Anil Kedia with Social Academic Award, Mohan Ojha with Social Management Award and Surya Nepal with Corporate Social Responsibility Award.The Lionism embarked in Nepal in 1971 as the Lions Club of Biratnagar under the stewardship of former Prime Minister Matrika Prasad Koirala.The Lions Clubs International says it has over 2,000 clubs operating across the nation. \nRoad networks have now connected the far-flung Karnali region, providing hope to people, mostly apple farmers, who can now send their produce to the markets and get reasonable prices.However, the poorly-constructed road networks have become a bane for the villagers. Whenever the crops become market-ready, disaster strikes. Rural roads are often a lifeline for these communities, but they remain closed most of the time due to an increase in disasters, which experts attribute to climate change.Now, some apple growers are discussing whether their harvests could be sent to bordering Tibetan cities, as roads are frequently damaged during the monsoon season at peak harvest time, halting supplies to the Nepali market. “It would be a great relief for apple growers in Humla if they could export apples to the Chinese cities,” said Namgyal Tamang, former president of Humla Chambers of Commerce and Industry.The apple farm in Dolpa covers 412 hectares. However, the district faces difficulties in sending the fruit to the market. Farmers complain that their apples often go to waste. Last year, Dolpa produced 3,696 tonnes of apples, but only 50 tonnes made it to the market, according to Ganesh Adhikari, chief of the Agriculture Development Office, Dolpa.“Roads are usually closed during the apple harvest, which is a big problem,” said Adhikari. “Many farmers store their apples using traditional methods. If the apples don’t decay, traders take them to markets like Nepalgunj and Surkhet.”Adhikari said apple production has increased this season, with output reaching 4,000 tonnes.In Simkot, the headquarters of Humla, apples have been planted on 518 hectares. Last year, the district produced 4,224 tonnes of apples, but none reached the market. Although a road network reached Simikot in March this year, transportation is completely stalled in Humla leaving farmers unable to sell their fruits.“The road has reached Simikot, but it has been three months since no vehicles have been operating. Some farmers use mules to transport apples, worried that the fruit will decay,” said Dasharath Rokaya, an apple farmer in ward 7 of Simkot rural municipality. “Shipping apples by air costs more than the fruit is worth,” he said.Rokaya said that apples go to waste every year due to a lack of roads. His orchard, which spans 25 ropani (1.27 hectares), has 150 apple trees. The cost to transport a kilo of apple from Humla to Nepalgunj by air is Rs130. And from Humla to Surkhet, it costs Rs120 per kg.Nimayangjum Lama of Bargaun in ward 3 of Simkot rural municipality, has set up a storage using traditional methods to keep apples for a month. “Nobody comes to buy in bulk. Though I store the apples, half of them decay,” she said.According to Lama, 25 big apple farms are operating in Simkot village. She said that apples are sent through flight only when the passenger takes them as gifts.Currently, an apple fetches up to Rs10. High quality apples produced in the upper reaches of Tilgufa municipality in Kalikot also go to waste.“There is a bumper production this year, but there is no road to transport them,” bemoaned Dhan Bahadur Shahi, a local farmer of Chilkhaya in Kalikot. “The high transport costs are another issue that farmers say do not cover the cost of production.”Last year, Shahi produced 42 tonnes of apples, but this season, output dropped to 30 tonnes as a hailstorm damaged the plants. His orchard has 500 apple trees. Sending apples to the Tarai cities through the Karnali highway using porters costs Rs10 per kg.In recent years, farmers in Phoimahadev, Chilkhaya, Rachuli, Jubitha, Chappre, Odanku of Mahabai, Gela, Mugraha of Subhakalika, Sukatiya, and Bharta of Kalikot have been engaged in commercial farming of apples.Although vehicles can reach the village from Nagma and Rachuli Bazar during winter, roads are generally obstructed during the rainy season, causing many problems for the farmers, said Parek Bahadur Shahi, a farmer from Jubetha.“Traders with their vehicles can reach farmers’ orchards in Jumla. If the road could operate round-the-year, all the apples could reach the market,” Parek said. “It is difficult for us to take our produce to the market, and on top of that, we don’t get fair prices for our products.”He said the village's lack of cold storage, packaging, and grading facilities forces farmers to harvest apples before they ripen. “Apples are sold for Rs45 per kg in the village.”Last year, 5,860 tonnes of apples were produced across 605 hectares in Kalikot.According to statistics from the Karnali province’s Ministry of Land Management, Agriculture and Cooperatives, apple is being grown on 3,419 hectares across all districts of the province except Surkhet. Last year, Karnali produced 31,000 tonnes of apples, and the production is expected to be around the same this year, said Dhan Bahadur Kathayet, spokesperson of the Land Management Ministry. He said storage problems, lack of grading, road access, and packaging contribute to the low market value of Karnali apples.Farmers are currently selling apples for Rs50 per kg. In Surkhet, a kilo of apples costs Rs125, while in Kathmandu, it reaches Rs250, Kathayat said. “With the lack of well-managed marketing, farmers are getting less value for their product, while consumers are compelled to pay high prices. Only traders and middlemen benefit.”Trucks carrying food and construction materials from Surkhet and Nepalgunj are returning with apples from Jumla, Mugu, and Kalikot.Among other districts in Karnali, Jumla produces 12,500 tonnes of apples on 3,100 hectares. While Jumla has long been renowned for its apples, the trend of commercial farming has been growing in recent years in the district.Min Bahadur Bhandari from ward 5 of Guthichaur rural municipality in Jumla has invested Rs220 million in his apple farm, which has 48,000 plants. The orchard produced 80 tonnes of apples last year. He said traders are visiting his farm to buy apples.Bhandari aims to produce 200 tonnes of apples this season. Tanka Giri of ward 3 of Guthichaur has planted 14,000 apple trees on 22 hectares with an investment of Rs70 million. It has been two years since he started apple cultivation.“There was no road in the past. When we couldn’t take those apples to the market, they were often fed to animals,” Giri said. “But now the demand for Jumla apples has reached international markets, and this has encouraged us to invest.”“Roads have been obstructed frequently for years,” said Karna Bahadur Budhathoki, a trader from Jumla. “A single day of halt in the transportation can spoil apples worth hundreds and thousands of rupees.”Budhathoki said that around 3 tonnes of apples that he purchased were spoiled. Currently, he is buying apples from farmers at Rs50 per kg. It costs an additional Rs20 per kg, which includes the cost of packaging the apples in cartons and transportation to Surkhet and Nepalgunj. \nThe much-delayed Dodhara Chandani dry port and check post project in farwestern Nepal has finally moved ahead after the provincial cabinet approved the use of forest land to build the facility.The Rs15 billion project is located in Dodhara Chandani Municipality, Kanchanpur district, and is listed by the government as a national priority project.In 2023, the government approved the project's environmental impact assessment (EIA) report.On September 18, the provincial cabinet gave permission to the Nepal Intermodal Transport Development Board to use 43 hectares of Mayapuri community forest in the buffer zone of Suklaphanta National Park, clearing the last major hurdle for the project.Once completed, the dry port is expected to boost the Nepal-India trade and help drive industrial development in the western region.Dodhara Chandani dry port will be the first business gateway to India from Nepal's farwest. The site is 245 km from India’s capital, New Delhi and 1,200 km from Gujarat state. Officials said the dry port will facilitate trade with other Indian states like Rajasthan, Uttarakhand, Punjab, and Haryana. It will also provide Nepal access to India’s largest seaport, Jawaharlal Nehru Port in Mumbai, enhance Nepal's foreign trade, and reduce costs.According to Nepali officials, transporting goods to Nepal through these routes will result in substantial savings.Most of Nepal's trade infrastructure is concentrated in the east, connecting to Kolkata port. Officials say the construction of a dry port in Sudurpaschim province may open up access to more Indian ports in the future.The project is also expected to reduce transportation costs and shorten the time required to import goods from India.Dodhara Chandani inland container depot will feature administrative buildings, customs office, banks, quarantine facilities, staff quarters, warehouses, and parking spaces.As per the master plan, the depot will eventually accommodate 3,000 20-foot freight trucks, although in the first phase will provide space for 300 trucks.The import warehouse will span 7,000 square metres, and the export warehouse will cover 2,520 square metres. The railway warehouse will be spread over 17,500 square metres, and the container stacking yard, a large open space for container movement, will cover 10,000 square metres.In the project's second phase, 126 hectares will be developed for additional warehouses and parking areas.A decade and a half ago, the World Bank conducted a feasibility study for the proposed dry port at Kanjabhoj in Dodhara Chandani Municipality, and the Nepal Intermodal Transport Development Board prepared another report in 2016. \"The cabinet has granted permission to the Nepal Intermodal Transport Development Board to use the land. With this approval, groundwork will begin within the next three months,\" said Ashish Gajurel, the board's executive director. \"We will now start cutting down the trees.\"He said that the national park has written to them to find land in other areas as compensation. \"If we can’t find suitable land, we will have to provide cash compensation equal to the value of the land.\"Gajurel said that they plan to open an office after the Dashain festival to begin work. \"We will clear the site to create a working environment for the Indian side and write to them to immediately begin the tender process and other related tasks,\" he said.According to the EIA, a total of 15,057 trees need to be felled. As per the Forest Clearance Guidelines, ten compensatory trees must be planted for every tree cut for development projects. Project officials say that 150,525 compensatory trees will need to be planted.Gajurel said they need to cut down 1,700 trees immediately, which they have already marked for removal.The dry port will be built under an Indian grant.According to the project, the transshipment centre will be constructed in two phases, and the first phase is estimated to cost Rs8 billion. Dodhara Chandani dry port will be located on the border with India. A twin dry port will be built on the Indian side in Banbasa.The first phase will be linked by road, while the second phase will be linked by rail. The completion deadline is three years from the start of construction.Work has already started on a Rs3.2 billion access road on the Indian side that will connect to Dodhara Chandani. The Indian government is building the access road.Three years ago, the government had decided to constrruct the facility in ward 1 of Chandani Municipality. However, following protests by local residents in Kanjabjoj, which is in ward 8 and was originally planned site, the project was relocated. Last year, during then-Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal's visit to India, it was agreed that the facility would be built by the Indian government.A four-lane bridge over the Mahakali River has been built, and an 8-km access road on the Nepal side between Gaddachauki and Malariya river in ward 1 of Dodhara Chandani.The dry port is expected to boost Nepal-India trade and contribute to industrial development in the western region. According to Nepali officials, transporting goods to Nepal through these routes will result in substantial savings. \nNepal has imported playing cards worth Rs61.1 million in just the first two months of the current fiscal year, according to data from the Department of Customs. The demand for playing cards, particularly high during the festive seasons like Dashain and Tihar, has driven significant imports from countries such as China, India, the US, and the UK.A total of 2,007,892 decks of playing cards were brought into the country during this period, generating Rs35.2 million in revenue for the government. Playing cards are widely used for leisure activities, and also in gambling practices during Nepal’s major festivals.In comparison, Rs64.4 million worth of playing cards were imported during the same two months last fiscal year, yielding Rs40.4 million in revenue. The data also shows that China was the largest exporter of playing cards to Nepal, contributing Rs52.1 million of the total imports this year, followed by India at Rs9 million.Last fiscal year (FY 2023/24), Nepal imported playing cards worth Rs321.8 million, with China and India being the major sources, contributing Rs282.3 million and Rs 26.8 million, respectively. Smaller quantities were also imported from countries like the US and Spain.In the previous fiscal year (2022/23), playing card imports stood at Rs 212.7 million, with Rs 187.6 million worth imported from China, Rs 21.5 million from India, and Rs 3.5 million from Brazil.The rising import figures suggest a steady demand for playing cards in Nepal, particularly during the festive seasons, with millions being spent annually on their procurement from international markets. \nWith the federal government slashing the budget of the nutrition programme, the distribution of fortified flour has been halted in all five districts of Karnali Province since the start of the ongoing fiscal year.Officials admit that the progress in improving nutrition in Karnali Province, achieved through years of efforts and investment, may have been jeopardised due to the suspension of the programme.“Thousands of pregnant women, new mothers, and young children have been deprived of fortified flour, which was crucial in reducing severe malnutrition among these,” said Lila Bikram Thapa, chief of the Nutrition Section at the Family Welfare Division under the Department of Health Services. “The provincial government has started providing Rs2,500 to new mothers, but there is no support for improving the nutrition of young children.”Malnutrition is a silent crisis in Nepal. The country has made significant progress in reducing stunting among children under five. Stunting decreased from 57 percent in 2001 to 25 percent in 2022, according to a report of the Nepal Demographic and Health Survey-2022.Likewise, wasting declined to eight percent from 10 percent in 2016. Wasting or low weight for a particular height is an undernutrition condition, which is a strong predictor of mortality among children under five, according to the World Health Organisation. Wasting in children is associated with a higher risk of death if not treated properly, according to it.Even though the survey report showed some improvement in the country’s overall nutrition status, progress is not the same in all provinces. The problem is more prevalent in the Karnali Province. According to the report, over 30 percent of children under five in the province are stunted, the highest in the country, which is an indicator of chronic undernutrition. The province is also the poorest and most food insecure compared to the national average.According to officials, as part of a super flour distribution programme launched in 2014, the government used to provide three kg of flour—fortified with all necessary micronutrients—to pregnant women, new mothers, and children aged six to 24 months every month to address chronic malnutrition problems in the province. For that, the Health Ministry used to allocate Rs 50 million. “This year, around Rs100 million has been cut from the nutrition programme budget and this is the main reason for the stoppage of the fortified flour distribution programme ” said Thapa. “Besides halting the flour distribution, the budget cut will also impact awareness programmes, which are crucial for reducing the burden of problems.”Nutrition experts warn that slashing Karnali Province's nutrition budget will have long-term consequences and could jeopardise the decades of progress in the sector.They say that authorities concerned should have promoted locally available foods, made people aware of the importance of nutritious foods and provided fortified flour to improve nutrition conditions and lessen dependency on freely distributed foods.They say that health authorities must continue awareness programmes to educate people about the importance of healthy food and what they have been providing.Doctors say malnutrition during pregnancy increases the risk of complications and maternal and neonatal deaths, as well as the likelihood of low birth weight. It is a major impediment to growth, affecting human capital and economic productivity.Experts say that nutrition has a direct link with the overall development of the country.They add that malnutrition affects children's physical and mental growth, ultimately affecting the country’s economic health.The Health Ministry had sought help from the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) to address the growing problems of malnutrition in Lumbini, Karnali, and Sudurpaschim provinces in the past.According to Thapa, the federal government has not renewed its contract with the World Food Programme, which provided logistic support for the fortified flour distribution programme.“This year, the government neither has renewed its agreement with the WFP (World Food Programme) nor allocated a budget for continuing the fortified flour distribution programme,” said Thapa.  \nSave the Children Nepal has launched a pilot initiative of introducing ‘rainbow kits’ specifically designed for transgender individuals impacted by disasters.The initiative aims to ensure that transgender people have dignified access to essential hygiene materials during times of humanitarian crisis.The rainbow kits break traditional gender binary norms by addressing the specific needs of the transgender community during humanitarian disasters, such as the recent flood and landslides in Nepal.“The rainbow kits are a response to the limitations of conventional humanitarian dignity and hygiene kits, which often fail to meet the needs of the LGBTQI+ population,” said Tara Chettry, country director for Save the Children in Nepal and Bhutan. “As diversity and inclusivity remain at the heart of Save the Children’s organisational values, I believe this initiative broadens our approach to humanitarian response, encouraging us to view aid through a more targeted and inclusive lens rather than a one-size-fits-all solution.”The kits were officially handed over to the Blue Diamond Society (BDS), a pioneering organisation working for the rights of LGBTQI+ individuals in Nepal. The BDS will distribute these essential kits to those affected by recent floods and landslides, ensuring that the specific hygiene needs of the LGBTQI+ community are met.The rainbow kit includes a carefully curated selection of items designed by Save the Children and the BDS to support health, dignity, and comfort, including condoms and lubricants, sanitary pads/menstrual cups/tampons, wipes, dry tissues, V-wash, panty liners, hot water bags, menstrual panty (free size), towel, hand sanitiser, toothpaste and brush, soap, masks, and other essential items.Tailored kits promote inclusivity and ensure that all identities are recognised and respected, regardless of their sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression and sex characteristics, said Manisha Dhakal, executive director of Blue Diamond Society. \nAmid the risk of a sharp rise in dengue cases in the coming days, the Ministry of Health and Population is gearing up to purchase rapid diagnostic test kits.Officials admit that they have only around 2,000 kits in stock, which is insufficient to carry out daily testing if cases spike.“We have decided to purchase rapid diagnostic test kits worth Rs 1 million immediately for dengue testing,” said Dr Bikash Devkota, director general at the Department of Health Services. “We have also asked health agencies under provincial governments to purchase rapid diagnostic test kits on their own.”Officials admit that the risk of an exponential rise in dengue cases has increased as the post-monsoon season, which is considered the peak dengue season, has just started, and the rainfall has not stopped. The recent disasters, which killed hundreds and displaced thousands, have also increased the risk of a surge in infections, experts say.At least 246 people have been confirmed dead, while 19 others are still missing following floods and landslides triggered by record-breaking rainfall some 10 days ago. As many as 173 people have been injured, and more than 17,120 others were shifted to safety, according to Nepal Police. “The risk of dengue infection has increased, as hundreds of displaced people are now living in temporary shelters, where water, sanitation and hygiene conditions have been compromised,” said Devkota. “Stored drinking water in these shelters could turn into breeding grounds for mosquitoes, the dengue vectors. We have alerted our health officials accordingly and asked them to launch an awareness drive in the high-risk areas.”Dengue is a mosquito-borne disease transmitted by female Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes. The same vector also transmits chikungunya, yellow fever, and Zika viruses, according to the World Health Organisation.At least seven deaths and 14,975 infections have been reported from 76 of 77 districts across the country since the start of monsoon this year. Experts say reported dengue cases could be just the tip of the iceberg, as around 90 percent of the infected people do not show any symptoms.Health officials say that they have communicated to provincial health authorities to prepare for a possible surge in dengue cases in the coming days. But provincial health authorities have instead asked the federal government agency to purchase testing kits and supply them to the provinces.“Some provincial health authorities have asked us to purchase dengue testing kits and supply them,” said Dr Yadu Chandra Ghimire, director of the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division. “But it is not possible for the federal government to purchase testing kits, which are required in huge quantities, due to budget constraints.” Since there is no specific treatment for dengue, health workers provide symptomatic care and diagnose patients based on symptoms.Of late, a surge in dengue cases has caused a critical shortage of blood in the Kathmandu Valley. The Central Blood Transfusion Service (blood bank) said that hospitals in the Valley have been facing a surge in demand for platelet-rich plasma and platelet concentrate due to the surge in dengue cases.“The daily demand for blood and blood components is about 400 pints, but we have only been able to collect about 100 pints,” said Sanjeev Kumar Yadav, senior technical officer at the Central Blood Transfusion Service. “We urge everyone eligible to step forward and donate blood. We have been struggling to meet the demand, and families of critically ill patients are in a difficult situation as they can’t find blood.”Officials attributed last week’s monsoon disaster and the start of the Dashain holidays to the decline in blood collection. They say the closure of colleges for the Dashain holidays, along with many offices and organisations suspending blood donation campaigns due to the festival, has led to a sharp drop in donations.According to doctors, mild to high fever, severe muscle pain, rashes, severe headache, and pain in the eyes are some symptoms of dengue.The World Health Organisation (WHO) says there is no specific treatment for severe dengue, but early detection and access to proper medical care can save lives.Dengue is a mosquito-borne viral disease transmitted by female Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes. The same vector also transmits chikungunya, yellow fever, and Zika, according to the WHO. \nRam Prasad Koirala, a resident of Nalagaun in Belkotgadhi Municipality, Nuwakot, spent all of Thursday racing around Kathmandu and Bhaktapur, desperately searching for platelets for his 13-year-old son, who has been infected with dengue.Doctors at the Maharajgunj-based Tribhuvan University Teaching Hospital, where his son is being treated, told Koirala to get platelets as his son’s platelet count had dropped to a dangerously low count of 13,000 per microlitre of blood. A healthy count ranges from 150,000 to 450,000 platelets a microlitre.“The doctors have asked me to arrange six pints of platelets, but I could manage only one pint,” a frustrated Koirala told the Post. “I spent the whole day visiting several blood banks across Kathmandu and Bhaktapur, but still couldn’t find donors.”This was a common refrain among many relatives of seriously ailing dengue patients who had come to the Central Blood Transfusion Service (blood bank) in search of platelets, as hospitals in the Valley have been reporting a surge in dengue cases.Officials at the central blood bank said that the demand for platelet-rich plasma and platelet concentrate has tripled compared to the usual daily collection.“Demand for blood and blood components is about 400 pints a day, but we have been able to collect only around 100 pints,” said Sanjeev Kumar Yadav, senior technical officer at the Central Blood Transfusion Service. “We urge everyone eligible to step forward and donate blood. We have been struggling to meet the demand, and families of critically ill patients are in a difficult situation as they can’t find blood.”Officials attributed last week’s monsoon disaster and the start of the Dashain holidays to the decline in blood collection. They say the closure of colleges for the Dashain holidays, along with many offices and organisations suspending blood donation campaigns due to the festival, has led to a sharp drop in donations.“We are ready to travel to Nuwakot, Dhading and other adjoining districts of the Valley to collect blood, as we have no other option for saving lives,” said Yadav. “Relatives of patients, especially those with dengue, have been waiting at the blood bank round the clock.”Officials at the blood bank are worried about a severe blood shortage, as colleges will not reopen until after the Chhath festival (first week of November), and many people will soon be leaving the Valley. They said there is already a daily demand for over 100 pints of platelet-rich plasma and platelet concentrate for dengue patients. As a single patient requires multiple pints, they lament that it is impossible to meet the demand at the current collection rate.“We have also sought help from mainstream as well as social media for blood donations,” said Yadav.Dengue is a mosquito-borne disease transmitted by female Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes. The same vector also transmits chikungunya, yellow fever, and Zika viruses, according to the World Health Organisation.At least seven deaths and 14,975 infections have been reported from 76 of 77 districts across the country. Experts say reported dengue cases could be just the tip of the iceberg, as around 90 percent of the infected people do not show any symptoms.The post-monsoon period is considered a high transmission season for dengue, but Nepal has witnessed outbreaks of the deadly disease since the beginning of the year and across the pre-monsoon, monsoon, and post-monsoon seasons.According to doctors, mild to high fever, severe muscle pain, rashes, severe headache, and pain in the eyes are some symptoms of dengue.The World Health Organisation says there is no specific treatment for severe dengue, but early detection and access to proper medical care can save lives. \nConcerns are growing about a possible rise in home deliveries in several districts after road links were disrupted last week’s devastating floods and landslides.Officials at the Ministry of Health and Population said that they are aware of the growing risk and have instructed agencies concerned to start risk mapping.“The risk of home deliveries has grown due to last week’s monsoon havoc,” said Dr Bikash Devkota, director general at the Department of Health Services. “We have instructed agencies concerned to monitor the situation and report back. We also held discussions with our development partners about the risks and requested them for help.”At least 233 people have been confirmed dead, while 22 others are still missing in the floods and landslides triggered by record-breaking precipitation in three days starting Thursday evening last week. As many as 169 people have been injured, and more than 17,120 others were shifted to safety, according to Nepal Police. Transport links to many districts have been disrupted by the floods and landslides that swept the roads and bridges in many places. Health facilities and birthing centres in many places were also destroyed in the disaster.Maternal health experts say that the recent disaster could cause a severe setback to maternal and child health and also affect institutional delivery rate.“Due to the disruption in vehicular movements, many pregnant women may not be able to reach birthing centres,” said Nisha Joshi, a public health official at the Family Welfare Division under the Department of Health Services. “Pregnant women and new mothers who have lost family members or property in the disasters would be unable to reach hospitals or health facilities for childbirth.”Health officials say that they have cautioned health workers in the affected areas about the heightened risk of an increase in home deliveries, which increases the risk of maternal and newborn deaths.A report on maternal mortality carried out by the National Statistics Office in 2021 showed that for every 100,000 live births, 151 women still died from maternity-related complications. Similarly, the institutional delivery rate has reached around 80 percent. Maternal death rate and home delivery rate are very high in remote areas. “We are aware of the risk of a rise in home deliveries, which poses a threat to the health of mothers and their newborn,” said Joshi. “We have requested the United Nations Population Fund and Nepal Red Cross Society to distribute warm clothes to 12 new mothers in the Nakkhu area of Lalitpur, who are taking refuge in makeshift shelters.”Maternal health experts say expecting mothers may face difficulties in attending regular checkups during pregnancy, which could put both their lives and babies at risk. Along with a potential drop in institutional deliveries, the number of antenatal and postnatal visits could also decline due to the impact of the disaster, according to them.With the government announcing free institutional delivery service in 2009 at all state-run health facilities, more than 2,800 birthing centres were set up across the country. The institutional delivery rate, which was around 18 percent then, has now increased to an average of around 80 percent across the country. The health ministry also provides travel allowances for antenatal care visits, offers skilled birth attendant (SBA) training to staff nurses, and hires them at birthing centres to help prevent deaths during or after childbirth.Nepal had cut the maternal mortality rate from 539 per 100,000 births in 1996 to 239 per 100,000 births in 2016—for which the country even received a Millennium Development Goals award.In the last fiscal year, at least 190 women from 51 districts died of complications during childbirth, data provided by the health ministry shows.The actual number of maternal deaths due to birth-related complications could be much higher, as maternal and perinatal death surveillance is being carried out in 51 districts only, officials say.Nepal’s target under the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals is to reduce the maternal mortality rate to 75 per 100,000 births by 2030. \nDusit Princess Kathmandu is organising a five-day trout festival at its SOI restaurant. The dishes will be available for order from 12:30 pm to 10:00 pm every day till August 30. In celebration of Nepal’s rivers and lakes, which provide an ideal environment for high-quality trout, the Director of Culinary Food and Beverage Service, Chef Utpal Mondal, and his team at Dusit Princess Kathmandu have crafted a menu showcasing the flavours and versatility of locally sourced trout. “As the festive month of Shrawan ends, people focus on healthy and nutritious food. Trout, rich in omega-3 fatty acids, vitamins, and essential minerals, offers a heart-friendly option that checks all the boxes from a nutritional and culinary standpoint,” says Mondal.He adds that the goal of the culinary event is to offer their guests a rare opportunity to experience a wide variety of trout dishes they wouldn’t typically find at home.The event menu features twelve unique dishes, six of which are drawn from diverse culinary traditions across continents. Three dishes are inspired by oriental cuisine, while the remaining three highlight flavours from Nepal and India. The menu has been designed to include various dishes, from soups and starters to main courses, including Mexican, Italian, Continental, and Thai flavours.While discussing the event’s highlights, Mondal said, “The celebration presents a unique opportunity for guests to indulge in a diverse range of trout-based dishes, something they wouldn’t typically have the chance to experience elsewhere.” \nI can vividly remember my first encounter with baking when I was 10 years old. We had just moved to our new home and got a cable connection. The cable opened a world of possibilities, as it gave me access to various contents.This was back in the late 2000s when YouTube would take hours to load, taunting us with its buffering screen. I was particularly drawn to travel and lifestyle channels, mainly TLC, Fox Life, and Food Network, which kept me informed about different foods and cultures. I don’t know why, but I was always drawn to desserts. It was fascinating to see how these miraculous treats made people smile at the end of the meal.Growing up in Nepal, I noticed that baking wasn't very common. While some families did have ovens, they were mostly multifunctional ones used primarily for heating food.I also noticed that most of our desserts didn't require an oven, as they could be made on a stovetop. So, you can imagine my excitement when my mom decided to buy an oven during one of her festive shopping sprees.I could finally feel the joy these channels portrayed. (I blame food writer Nigella Lawson for getting me hooked on a domestic lifestyle.) Then, one day, after watching one of the cooking episodes on television, I finally mustered enough strength and decided to bake something. I distinctly remember wanting to make a chocolate cake for myself after watching one of Rachel Allen’s bake series. I watched all the ingredients used in that recipe and scurried across my pantry, only to realise I didn’t have half of the stuff she mentioned. I then decided to improvise the recipe (a big mistake). I randomly combined the ingredients that I had in a mixing bowl and chucked the batter into my oven, hoping for a magical cake to pop out an hour later.After I saw the result an hour later, I was mortified. The cake was stuck in the pan, refusing to come out, and it was as dense as fudge. I convinced myself that the taste was what mattered most, but when I served a slice to my brother, he made a face of utter disgust.That was the day I realised that baking soda was not the same as baking powder.After this incident, I researched baking and found out it was technical. This was a blessing in disguise for me, as I loved science, and I started to view baking as a science experiment. I then reflected and evaluated how to perfect one's baking skills.I analysed my errors and noted down all the steps I did every time I baked. Home baking is a passion for many. The idea of turning a few simple ingredients into a delicious masterpiece is as enchanting as it sounds.Yet, for many of us, this seemingly magical process can often turn into a series of unfortunate events, leading to crumbled dreams and deflated ambitions. Dense cakes, burnt crusts, rock-hard cookies and unrisen bread, if you are an amateur baker, then you have seen it all. But why do these mishaps happen so often? And most importantly how do we overcome them?From my experience, behind every successful bake lies a series of challenges and mishaps that test even the most dedicated bakers. Baking has its own set of rules that you need to follow to get that scrumptious treat every time. So, to transform a recipe into an actual dish that will impress your friends and family, I am sharing with you some of the tips and tricks I learned from my tumultuous journey as a home baker.First things first, we have to look into the prime appliance that we are working with. Commercial ovens are of two types: one that runs on gas and the other that runs on electricity. We have to look at the oven present at our home and consider its pros and cons. The main benefits of a gas oven are its size and temperature control. One can quickly change the temperature just by twisting the knob, and it preheats much more quickly than an electric one. However, they are known to have uneven temperatures at times and release more humidity, making it harder to properly crisp or brown food. This can result in burnt edges and cold or hot spots. An electric oven, on the other hand, provides more even and consistent temperatures and doesn’t release as much moisture in the air.This dry oven environment makes it easier to brown your items, making it great for baking bread. However, while the dry oven results in more even cooking, you also run the risk of drying out cakes and other baked goods.Also, many people forget to preheat the oven before baking, which is crucial for maintaining an even temperature throughout the baking process. When baking cakes and bread, I like to place a small tray of water at the bottom of the oven to provide moisture and prevent the baked goods from drying out.An oven thermometer can be a baker's best friend, providing a true reading and ensuring your creations bake evenly. I also like rotating the pan midway while baking, as it allows for an even distribution of heat.The next thing people mess up on is measuring and the specificity of ingredients in a recipe. Our moms made our food with their instinct; it is something that they learned along the way, but when you are baking, you cannot instinctively add or omit a few steps.I think that is why we initially had problems with baking. In a culture where cooking comes instinctually, baking challenges us, to be precise. A gram of more or less of any ingredient can drastically alter the outcome. Different methods of measuring flour can yield different results.Every component in baking serves a distinct purpose and function. Flour offers structure, sugar adds sweetness and moisture, eggs bind things together, and butter enhances taste and texture. However, not all ingredients are created equally. For example, using salted butter instead of unsalted might change the taste profile of your meal.Similarly, different flours have varying protein concentrations, which affect the texture of baked goods. The type of sugar used also makes a difference. Granulated sugar, brown sugar, powdered sugar, and speciality sugars like turbinado or muscovado each add unique flavours to a bake.Understanding these nuances and how they interact is critical for getting the intended outcomes. Accurate measurement tools and techniques are essential, but mastering them can be a steep learning curve. So, I would recommend investing in a kitchen scale that allows for more accurate measurements by weight rather than volume.Moving on, leavening agents such as baking soda, baking powder, and yeast are required to make baked goods rise. However, they can also cause confusion and errors. Baking soda needs an acidic component to activate, but baking powder has both an acid and a base, making it self-activating.Using the wrong type of flour or sugar, or using them in incorrect proportions, can result in flat, overly raised, or collapsed cakes. Yeast, being a living organism, presents its challenges.The water temperature must be just right—not too hot to kill the yeast, nor too cold to inhibit its activity. Proofing times and conditions also need to be carefully managed to achieve the perfect rise.Bakers should also be careful about the way they mix ingredients. The method of mixing ingredients can significantly impact the final product. Over-mixing can develop too much gluten in cakes and pastries, leading to tough textures.Under-mixing can leave pockets of unincorporated ingredients, resulting in uneven bakes. Techniques like folding, creaming, and whipping each serve specific purposes and must be executed with care.Finally, home bakers must understand the importance of timing and patience in baking. Even a minute or two can make the difference between perfectly baked cookies and burnt edges.Recipes often provide a range for baking times, but factors like oven hot spots, pan material, and altitude can affect these times. It’s crucial to keep a close eye on your bakes and rely on visual and tactile cues, such as a cake pulling away from the sides of the pan or a toothpick coming out clean, to determine doneness.Baking is also an exercise in patience, a virtue not everyone possesses. Doughs need time to rest and rise, flavours need time to meld, and baked goods need time to cool before they can be enjoyed.Impatience can lead to underbaked centres, crumbling slices, and a general sense of frustration. Cultivating patience is as important as mastering any technique in the baker’s repertoire.Home baking is a journey full of ups and downs, but it comes with great rewards. The obstacles encountered teach valuable lessons in patience, precision, and perseverance.The satisfaction of success, the freedom to create, and the therapeutic benefits make the endeavour meaningful. Whether baking for oneself, loved ones, or as an artistic outlet, the journey is as fulfilling as the result. Embrace the flour-dusted countertops, occasional setbacks, and the joys of home bakingFor a beginner-friendly recipe that involves mixing ingredients and delivers amazing results, try my recipe for fudgy, nutty brownies that I call ‘Bliss Brownies’.Bliss Brownies150g unsalted butter plus extra for the tin150g chopped dark chocolate200g caster sugar½ tsp baking powder2 eggs80g cocoa powder150g plain flour70g mixture of nuts (walnuts and almonds)60g blended papayaMix all the ingredients (except the dark chocolate and nuts) in a blender or a food processor and blitz till you get a smooth paste.Fold the chocolate and the nuts into the brownie batter, making sure that the pieces are evenly mixed in.Grease a loaf pan with soft butter and dust with cocoa powder. Pour the batter into the loaf pan.Bake in a preheated oven at 170c for 40 minutes and let it cool in the oven for an hour. Enjoy with a cup of coffee or, as I like it, a scoop of vanilla ice cream. \nIn a world where acceptance and safety often seem difficult to attain, many queer individuals also struggle to find a safe space to express themselves. They have to hide their true self and face relentless judgement when going to public places like cafes and restaurants.This is the reality for countless LGBTQIA+ individuals. The need for a safe space for this community is not just a desire but a necessity—a space where one can be themselves. This struggle for safety and acceptance can be traced to crucial historical moments, such as the Stonewall Riots of 1969 in New York City.The Stonewall Inn was more than a bar; it was a refuge for the queer community. When police raided the bar, the community fought back. This series of violent confrontations, which began in the early hours of June 28, 1969, between police and gay rights activists, marked the beginning of the modern LGBTQIA+ rights movement. The spirit of Stonewall, the fight for dignity and the right to exist openly lives on in places like Inclusive Galaxy Restaurant in Kathmandu. Inclusive Galaxy beyond a restaurant is an ‘oasis’ for the queer community and beyond.Founded by Bishwaraj Adhikari, Mr Gay Handsome Nepal 2013, a human rights defender, the restaurant proves the power of safe spaces. It’s a place where the community can unite, free from the prejudice and hostility that often permeate their everyday lives.After years of working in the human rights sector, Adhikari and his partner developed the idea for Inclusive Galaxy. What began as a small cafe gradually evolved into a full-fledged restaurant, driven by the growing demand and support from the community.“In developed countries with strong LGBTQIA+ movements, you can find community areas like gay villages. These are created as safe spaces for people whose families and communities have excluded them. They also support new business ideas and pink tourism. I hope to see pink tourism develop in Nepal someday,” says Adhikari. His vision for Inclusive Galaxy goes beyond just being a restaurant. He aims to promote financial independence and empowerment within the queer community.Since its inception in February 2019, Inclusive Galaxy has become a key spot for many in Lazimpat, a relatively queer-friendly area in Kathmandu. The location is essential because the first LGBTQIA+ movement in Nepal started in 2001 through the Blue Diamond Society.Inclusive Galaxy, true to its name, welcomes everyone—queer and non-queer alike—to share a comfortable space. His vision was clear: to create a space where people of all genders and sexual identities could come together without fear of exclusion.“I didn’t want to make it exclusively for queer people because that would be excluding ourselves from society. Different groups need to live together and understand each other,” Adhikari explains.In the early days, the cafe attracted both queer and non-queer customers. However, when some of the residents learned about Adhikari’s identity and the nature of the clientele, there was a brief period of hesitation. “At first, I didn’t understand what was happening, but then I realised my identity was an issue for a few people. I believe people should be judged by others by their character, not by their gender or sexuality. Over time, as residents saw that we operated like any other cafe, they became more comfortable,” Adhikari reflects.Adhikari started Inclusive Galaxy to give queer individuals a place to be proud of themselves, counteracting the self-doubt and insecurity that hiding one’s identity can cause. This turned the cafe very quickly into a community hub. The journey was not without challenges, though. It was difficult to hire staff and cooks from the LGBTQIA+ community, and soon after the restaurant opened, the COVID pandemic made things even harder.Despite these difficulties, the doors of Inclusive Galaxy remained open. During the pandemic, many queer individuals, who were abandoned by their families or afraid to return home, found comfort at Inclusive Galaxy.Since many couldn’t afford to pay for meals, the restaurant provided free food from its resources. As the number of people needing meals grew to 20-30 daily, Adhikari started raising funds within the community.“During my time as an activist, many people came here not only for food but also to see an organisation where the queer community supports one another,” Adhikari says.“The time during COVID was difficult, but it brought me closer to the community.”Four years after its inception, the restaurant has garnered a loyal following. Sarosy Neupane, Miss Pink Nepal 2024 first runner-up, describes Inclusive Galaxy as her second home. She moved to Kathmandu to study in 2022. Being distant from her family, she started visiting Galaxy for meals that reminded her of home-cooked food. Over time, she grew attached to the café because of its welcoming atmosphere.“It’s heartwarming to see people from our community and different walks of life here. The founders even invite us to festivals like ‘Dahi Chiura Khane din,’” she shares.Neupane visits the cafe regularly and sometimes stays until 3 am, engrossed in conversations. “I hope more spaces like this can open in the future. If, unfortunately, this place were to close someday, I don’t think we’d have any other place to turn to,” she adds.Muna Chhetri, a trans woman who has been a loyal customer for three years, shares, “This is my safe space where I can truly be myself. I always feel judged in other restaurants, but that fear doesn’t exist here. It’s where even those who aren’t accepted at home can feel accepted.”Sahara Khadka Chhetri, owner of Pink Tiffany, Kathmandu’s first openly LGBTIQIA+ friendly restaurant and bar, frequently visits after managing the bar, appreciating the convenience of not cooking at home.She notes very few places like this cater to our community, and some even had to close during COVID. “As an entrepreneur, I know that sustaining these spaces is a challenge. But as more spaces like these open, they will make the way for a more inclusive and compassionate society.”The welcoming atmosphere at Inclusive Galaxy has also had a surprising effect on non-queer patrons. Samriddha Jung Rana, a twenty-year-old neighbour who identifies as straight, often visits the café and appreciates the importance of such spaces.“Previously, I didn’t know much about the queer community and didn’t care much. But now, coming into this café, I’ve been interested in their rights and issues. I’ve realised that we’re not so different after all. We are all human,” he remarks.The ventures like Inclusive Galaxy and Pink Tiffany have inspired hope for collaborative businesses between queer and non-queer groups. The recent initiative by the Nepal Tourism Board promoting Pink Tourism in April 2024 is a positive step. Still, Adhikari believes that more support is needed from the government and the private sector.Despite the progress, challenges remain. However, Adhikari remains optimistic about the future. He is working on plans to develop the restaurant into a homestay program in the future.“Like how different planets, asteroids, and stars make up a beautiful galaxy, people from all walks of life and identities make a beautiful society. I am happy that we are assimilating together in this space. We are not so different; we are all different and similar simultaneously,” he says. \nAditya Mishra is a Nepali chef and entrepreneur based in New York. Passionate about elevating Nepali cuisine globally, Mishra sharpened his culinary skills while staging at various Michelin-starred restaurants in the city during his time at culinary school. A recipient of the James Beard Foundation National Scholars Scholarship in 2023, Mishra’s early experiences inspired him to establish his own supper club, ‘The Sewing Tin’, alongside co-founder Akhil Upad.In an interview with Post’s Aarati Ray, Mishra discusses his restaurant in New York, serving Nepali cuisines there and the recipe for his signature dish.How did your cooking journey start in New York?At 14, I told my parents I wanted to be a chef, but they preferred I pursue a stable career like engineering, as many Nepali families do. So, I left for Louisiana in 2019 to study engineering.But, cooking never left my heart so, after a year, I left engineering college and moved to New York City. It’s been three and a half years and my parents only learned about it later. When my mom visited me in NYC and saw my dedication to cooking, she saw my passion and supported my decision.What sparked your interest in cooking from a young age?As a child, I was drawn to cooking shows on TLC. The glamour of cooking, eating, travelling and the prosperity of famous chefs was fascinating.Around age 16, I discovered Chef Anthony Bourdain’s groundbreaking book, ‘Kitchen Confidential’, which shed light on the reality of the culinary industry. I learned how he became a cultural icon in NYC, reshaping perceptions of chefs.I was also fascinated by chefs like Marco Pierre White, who was a mentor to Gordon Ramsay. Their stories of achieving fame while maintaining discipline intrigued me. But, as I grew older and entered the culinary world, I realised it was far from glamorous—it involved dedication and I am glad I persevered.How did the idea for The Sewing Tin originate?The concept of ‘The Sewing Tin’ came when I realised the stark contrast between the romanticised view of kitchen work and its harsh reality. Witnessing the struggles of many kitchen staff—economic hardships, immigration challenges and language barriers—I had to rediscover my love for cooking.During my internship at ‘Junoon’ restaurant, I met my co-founder, Akhil Upad, who shared my culinary enthusiasm despite his preparations for medical college. Together, we wanted to create a dining experience that was more personal and communal, offering fine dining with a sense of community.We wanted our food to tell stories, so we named our restaurant ‘The Sewing Tin’ inspired by the immigrant experience in NYC. When immigrants opened cookie boxes as kids, they often found sewing supplies instead of food.‘The Sewing Tin’ is like opening a cookie box and finding sewing supplies—something uniquely desi, or South Asian. How do you promote Nepali cuisine in New York City through The Sewing Tin?My partner is from Atlanta with Indian roots, while I come from Nepal, so our menu celebrates and reflects both cultures and heritage.We represent our respective cultures authentically. For example, we have a dish inspired by Newari cuisine called kachaila, similar to French Tartar. We present it as Tartar to make it accessible to our customers but infuse it with Nepali flavours, telling stories about its origins and giving diners a taste of my homeland.What do you think of the prospects of Nepali cuisine abroad?I’m on a mission to share Nepali food worldwide. I have served up dishes like chatamari and lamb sekuwa in my restaurant. But I’m still learning and want to explore more of Nepal’s cuisines. My big dream? To make Nepali cuisine reach more places because it’s got something special that can wow taste buds everywhere.How do you see the changes in restaurants in Nepal?The restaurant industry has deep roots in community and bringing people together, dating back centuries. While this core idea remains, modern restaurants have evolved, making changes to adapt to the times.Yet, in Nepal, despite the growing number of restaurants, many lack uniqueness and storytelling, focusing more on making money than fostering a sense of community.I’ve noticed a troubling trend of rising prices, especially for beloved dishes like momos, which makes people question if they're getting value for their money. It seems like profits are taking precedence over creating genuine, authentic culinary experiences.The industry is starting to lose the creativity and passion that once made it special. It might be time for chefs to shake things up, challenge the norm and bring fresh ideas to the table, revitalising the culinary scene with renewed energy and creativity.What challenges have you faced in New York as an outsider?Living in a bustling city like New York as an outsider has its challenges. But, this city is also full of opportunities for those who are passionate. If you stay true to your culture and want to share your story, opportunities are waiting for you.Even though it can be daunting because of the tough competition, the city appreciates determination and expertise. When I started my journey here, all I wanted to do was cook, eat and share the story of Nepal and its diverse cultures. Instead of focusing on the difficulties, I embraced the chance to follow my passion.What do you think about the criticism of blending Nepali food with modern culinary styles?Chefs care about their food—it’s like they’re sharing a story. They’ve put in a lot of effort to become skilled, so let them be creative. It’s okay to give helpful advice but don’t be mean just to criticise. Chefs shouldn’t also just copy what’s popular, they should cook what they truly love. That’s what makes food special and meaningful.Mishra’s signature dish:Confit Duck Chatamari A traditional Nepali delicacy with French influence.Ingredients:Duck (Legs and breast)Rice (soaked overnight)MayonnaiseWhole spices (cloves, cinnamon, cardamom, bay leaf)Red onionGarlicGingerMula ko achar (Fermented radish)ScallionsLemon juiceNepali pepperVinegarSaltSugarProcedure:For the Duck:Season duck with salt and pepper.Cook in a covered pan with whole spices, garlic, and ginger at low heat for 2 hours on a stove (270 degrees in the oven)Increase heat to crisp up the skin (approximately 15 minutes).Shred the duck meat.Confit Garlic Aioli:Mash cooked garlic and ginger and mix with mayonnaise, lemon juice, Nepali pepper and fermented radishes.Pickled Onions:Slice onions and cook in a mixture of vinegar, water, salt, sugar, and whole spices until softened (about 10 minutes).For the chatamari:Blend soaked rice to make a batter, let it ferment for 6 hours, and adjust consistency with water.Assembling:Cook chatamari batter in duck fat for 4 minutes.Top with shredded duck, aioli, pickled onions and scallions.Serve \nCeleus Baral exudes a serene aura when you meet her, and when she tells you she bakes, it makes sense. Even during a brief encounter, you can tell she has the patience needed to be a baker.“You can eyeball cooking, but baking is chemistry. You have to be meticulous. You cannot rush it, or it does not turn out as expected,” says the 21-year-old environment science student. She also runs the online baking shop Bakeleus. Recently, she has also started selling her baked goods beyond her online shop, with her first stall appearing at The Yellow House’s Night Market. Bakeleus’s menu lists a variety of offerings, including jams, granola, tarts, cakes, cookies, cupcakes and brownies. Baral began baking in 2020, during the lockdown, and launched her online shop last year.She grows much of the produce she incorporates into her baking, and believes we should all understand the origins of our food. “This connection fosters gratitude and a deeper appreciation for nature,” she says. Her background in environmental science, coupled with her affinity for the natural world, imbues her creations with a unique artistic sensibility. Each item she bakes is a testament to her creativity and experimentation, as she believes consistent practice is the key to mastery.Despite the demands of being a full-time student, Baral strives to accommodate orders, typically requiring a minimum of 72 hours' notice for delivery. She is a passionate and discerning individual, evident in the love she infuses into her baking. Additionally, Baral advocates for a zero-waste policy at home, ensuring that every scrap of food and all household items are recycled.Three easy to bake recipes you can try at homeMini carrot cakes Ingredients:38 g milk or yoghurt35 g all-purpose flour1/4 tea spoon ground cinnamon1/8 tea spoon ground gingerA pinch of cardamom1 tea spoon baking powder½ tea spoon fine sea salt2 large eggs, at room temperature27 g granulated sugar13 g brown sugar (or 39 g of regular granulated sugar)1 tea spoon vanilla extract27 g extra virgin olive oil33 g carrots, peeled and shreddedChopped walnutsCandied lemon or orange slices (optional for garnish)Cream cheese frosting56.5 g unsalted butter, softened113.5 g cream cheese, softened1/2 teaspoon vanilla extractA pinch of salt250 g powdered sugarDirections:For the cake:Preheat the oven to 195°C.

Yet, pockets of the past remain—small, peaceful neighbourhoods where houses are still made of wood, paths are made of stone tiles, and the stillness of a world that wants to stay intact and immobile. These places are known for tourism, culture, and the restoration of community pride. One such stop is the quiet village of Khokana in southern Lalitpur.Khokana is comparatively close to the mainland urban Lalitpur; from the ring road junction of Bagdole, it takes only a 10-minute drive to reach there. From the airport, you can take a cab directly to Khokana, which will take around half an hour. Get your cameras and hiking boots ready; the area is filled with historical artefacts and hiking trails.However, it is vastly different from the city. It is much nearer to the hills, where stone-paved paths, which could easily be goat trails, are rare in today’s Kathmandu.One such goat trail leads to Sikali temple, a major attraction of the area and accessible only on foot. The pavements are lined with big and small temples on each side, along with ponds that serve as clean water sources and a location for religious rituals. The houses are made of bricks and wood. The concrete invasion, although present, is minimal. Scattered every few hundred metres are small mustard oil mills, co-operative businesses of the locals of Khokana that have existed since medieval times.A site well-recognised for its historical significance, Khokana was even proposed to be made a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1996. Sikali TempleAround an hour’s walk from the historic town, Sikali Temple can be reached, which is also the location for its famed Sikali Jatra.While it can be reached through any public vehicle, a more holistic and adventurous route is to follow the goat trails on the outskirts of Khokana. This route, albeit long, allows for great hiking opportunities, scenic views of the hills surrounding the Kathmandu Valley, and a close-up view of the mediaeval but well-maintained architecture of the local houses.Even if you lose the way, which is very possible, the locals are very welcoming and more than willing to guide you. The main temple itself is three stories tall, and built in the Pagoda style, a common style in many temples in the valley.It is surrounded by a lush grass field which plays the stage to the Sikali Jatra held every year. The temple, like many religious spots around Khokana, is dedicated to the local deity Shree Rudrayani.The Sikali Jatra, a five-day festival that serves as an alternative to Dashain for the Khokana locals, is filled with chariot dances, battle enactments, and storytelling celebrations in the worship of Goddess Rudrayani.Starting from Ghatasthapana in mid to late September, the Jatra is vibrant and an essential experience for every visitor. Historical Khokana townKhokana’s historical town is located around 5 minutes walking distance from the local bus park. The town complex, paved with hand-made stone tiles, is graced with the Indrayanee temple but also has many red-bricked houses built in the local Newari architecture, some of them centuries old.One such house is the ‘Khokana Museum’. Although closed, it is widely popular for being the first house to be lit with electricity in Nepal, as Chandra Shamsher did in 1911.The stand-holder of the first light bulb can still be seen, serving as a historical monument for everyone to see.Similarly, the town complex is also filled with Guthi houses, small ponds, and even the local Ward office. While the Ward office provides a wealth of information for visitors interested in the area’s history, the Guthi halls symbolise the strong community support culture of the locals.The ponds, a notable one present right opposite the Indrayanee temple, have stone taps and remind us of primitive ways of obtaining clean water—a practice many locals are still engaged in.Yet, these ponds are also religious locations, especially used in rituals in the Sikali Jatra.Finally, a stroll through the complex allows visitors to explore old houses and historical artefacts in the serene quietness of Khokana, while the small outlets and Choila places nearby allow you to enjoy the spicy duck or chicken delicacies at the same time.Overall, the historical complex is enough to transport visitors back to a glimpse of the medieval past of the Kathmandu Valley. Mustard oil millsThe most well-known feature of Khokana is its mustard oil mills, which have been operational for hundreds of years and have been using the same methods of preparation since their inception.These mills, scattered throughout Khokana, are often community-owned, and even the ones owned by certain individuals have almost exclusively employed locals.Despite the advent of modern machinery, there is still substantial demand for their products due to the assured guarantee.When I visited one such mill, the local staff informed me that the furnace and oil presser used by them were 300 years old, given by the Patan royalty even before the Shahs became king.In addition to buying pure, organically created mustard oil and pellets, visiting these oil mills offers many educational benefits for international and local tourists alike.Khokana offers visitors a unique glimpse into a preserved bubble of the past through its tranquillity, preservation of ancient lifestyle and cultural elements, and remarkable self-sustenance.  \n“How much oxygen do you have for the summit?”I think this is the kind of question a film producer would ask. But when you're on the mountain, the answer is never clear.I have worked for a long time in the film industry and different art areas, especially photography and engraving.Working in various fields and drawing inspiration from them has become a new normal for me. I have made this approach my way of life without even realising it.I took responsibility for producing the last movie I worked on and shot the behind-the-scenes footage for a documentary. By doing so, I witnessed the entire shooting process and the journey of a movie.In the snowy highlands of Turkey, we had to endure the consequences of the changing climate to shoot ‘About Dry Grasses’, directed by Nuri Bilge Ceylan. The highlands used to be snowy in January, but by the time we got there in the same month, there was no snow. Nature was changing. It was responding to what was happening—to what humanity had done to it. In the end, it snowed, and we shot the intense snow scenes we wanted. But since most of our days were sunny, unlike what the director wanted, we had to shoot in the sunset and sunrise hours. As crew members, we spent many days waiting for the sun to set.Production requires creating opportunities, finding solutions, and being creative for a work of art to come true. For this, patience, endurance, calmness, and timing are necessary. On the other hand, nature wanted us to listen to it and wait for the right time.During that time, I witnessed many of nature's lessons. For example, I experienced extreme cold for the first time. We endured temperatures ranging from -33 degrees to +55 degrees. By listening to nature, surrendering to its forces, and working within its limits, we managed to persevere.No matter how much you prepare or plan during the pre-production phase, if you are working in nature, remember that nature will always have the final say.The film was completed, released, and connected with audiences. Its success at Cannes 2023 was followed by my trip to the North Pole for my project. I returned with a mix of wonderful developments, joys, and challenges. During this process, I experienced life and death, happiness and sadness, losses and awards.I realised the value of being able to breathe comfortably a few days after my father's chemotherapy ended. Just a few days earlier, he had said, \"Well done, my daughter. I'm glad you went!\" All the anxiety and hard work, filled with fears at the beginning, were finally behind me.Before going to Everest, when I was on the verge of giving up, defeated by my fears, I remembered my father's words. Everest reminded me of what he said while struggling to breathe, adding a turning point to my life.What does it mean to say ‘life’s turning point?’ How many turning points can there be in life?Who am I, and what am I doing in this world? How well do I know my own limits? Can I find answers to these big questions? These thoughts sparked my dream of journeying to Everest. Now, after returning, I can say that it turned my life around.“How much oxygen do you need for the summit?” sounds more like “How much do you need to hold on to life?” How many reasons do you find that give meaning to your life, keep you alive, and allow you to breathe? How much can you endure in the face of obstacles, and can you keep believing that a solution will eventually come your way?Can these questions be separated from the idea of measuring and assessing something, from learning its quantity and financial value? Can everything be known with certainty? Should the journey be fully understood in advance, with all its promises laid out? Should it be viewed like a purchase with a price tag, asking, “Is this journey worth this much?”I had never trekked before and had no climbing experience. I had lived at sea level my entire life and had never been to a high altitude.However, this journey was not only about the physical climb but also an inner discovery. After losing my father to lung cancer, his breathing difficulties taught me the fragility of breath, life, and existence. I also mentally prepared myself for the physical challenges I might face. Despite all my concerns, could this journey help me understand the cycle of life and the resilience of the soul?So, how could I make this trek possible? How could I land in Nepal? Despite all the economic difficulties and the many things I felt needed organising, I did my best and believed in it.Since I was embarking on this journey, I felt I should share about my travels and inspire others.Starting with photography, cinema, and engraving, which are already integral parts of my life, I dreamed of documenting and sharing the inspiring aspects of this journey.After months of correspondence and dreaming, it all came true. Finally, I embarked on the journey with the goal of creating photographs, engravings, and documentaries. I learned a great deal from my travels in Nepal, from the people I met, and from every moments I witnessed. I felt incredibly fortunate to have been able to honour my father’s memory with the peace and serenity I experienced in the Himalayas.During my 15-day journey to Everest Base Camp, I encountered nature’s masterpieces at every turn. As concerns like “How will I endure?” and “How will I finish?” started to weigh on me, the mountains suddenly parted with the clouds and gazed down at me.It was amazing to witness the appearance of ‘Gods’ that I had never seen before, in such immense size and in such a close, awe-inspiring manner beside me during that silent walk.As someone who came from one of the most crowded cities in the world, Istanbul, while I struggled with my daily questions and uncertainties, trying to control everything, they stood there calmly, as if answering me.They were just there—before and after.My guide, Lakhpa Sherpa, always reminded me not to worry about how high we were, how long it would take to reach our accommodation, or what the weather would be like. He encouraged me to live in the moment, and he was right.He advised me to focus on my breathing, not to get thirsty, to eat enough, and to appreciate the extraordinary beauty of the journey. In the mountains, plans dissolve and each moment is embraced as it comes.All the good wishes, prayers, and everything encountered along the way were for the journey itself. The mountain was full of life, secrets, and everything I had wondered about.This 15-day journey to Everest Base Camp was a solo adventure, yet I wouldn't have been able to complete it without my guide, Lhakpa, and my porter. Additionally, I was fortunate enough to experience the hospitality, generosity, and honesty at Trekkers Paradise, which organised the entire journey and provided guidance.I witnessed how dedication and sincerity are crucial in completing a journey safely and healthily. Ghanshyam Sharma, from Trekkers Paradise and Sauraj Jhingan, a climber who summited the Everest in 2018, shared their experiences with me during the journey.They experienced the 2015 earthquake while they were at the Everest Base Camp.As a filmmaker, their role as actors, and attention to detail played a significant role in bringing my dream photography and documentary project to life.The sponsors of my journey were Turkish Airlines, The North Face, Apple, Canon, and Stanley. My supporters include Oscar International College and Nepal Film Campus. Throughout the journey, I shared many experiences, memories, and countless photos and images with my students.On my way back home after 21 days, I celebrated my birthday on the plane. From the right window, the Himalayas bid me farewell. I felt like I had opened a new chapter in my life, and I was certain that I would return.I had made many friends and memories in Nepal.For now, I will be working on a documentary and preparing for a photography and engraving exhibition titled ‘My Soul Beyond the Mountain’.To the Himalayas: This summer was spent with you, but we will meet again soon. \nWe spent five days in Sri Lanka two weeks ago, driving up and down the island, covering almost 70 percent of its territory. Our tour spanned over 1,000 kilometres, including hills, beach spots, and heritage and religious sites.Our first stop in Sri Lanka was Colombo’s Bandaranaike International Airport. We were greeted by a warm and humid breeze when we exited the airport. The host briefed us (a group of journalists) that heavy rainfall has affected areas across Sri Lanka since mid-May 2024. Rain and storms intensified on June 1, with the most significant effects in the south and west of the country. We were lucky to have no rain in the forecast.On the first night, we checked into the lavish Jetwing Lake resort, an opulent sanctuary amidst the lush landscape. The resort’s expansive grounds were a retreat, offering a glimpse of Sri Lanka's natural beauty. We feasted on delicious cuisine, every bite exploding with flavour, introducing us to the island’s famed culinary delights. On June 7, early morning, the sun shone brightly, previewing the promise of an incredible journey ahead. We set off early the following day, eager to explore the mysteries of this enchanting island. As we ventured further into the heart of Sri Lanka, the landscape revealed its majestic nature. We were astounded by seeing Pidurangala Rock, a 200-metre-high granite colossus just a kilometre north of Sigiriya. The short hike to Pidurangala Rock offered breathtaking views of Sigiriya and beyond. We climbed the steep steps and soon were rewarded with a breathtaking panoramic view of the surrounding landscape. It took us 30 minutes to climb. The sight took our breaths away and left us humbled in the presence of such grandeur. From the top are glorious vistas of the surrounding landscape and an incredible view of the majestic Sigiriya Rock. From there, Sigiriya Lion’s Rock is visible, standing alone. This was the place where demon king Ravana had his palace in the Treta Yuga. Believed to have been built 50 centuries ago, the palace is said to have had a unique lift for Ravana and his visitors. Ravana imprisoned Sita in one of the caves at the bottom of this humongous boulder. Sigiriya is a fifth-century fortress in Sri Lanka carved out of an inselberg, a hill of hard volcanic rock that soared high above the surrounding jungle. We spent two hours atop the rock, mainly taking photographs. We descended from Pidurangala Rock, filled with awe and a sense of accomplishment.The journey ahead seemed even more enticing as we ventured along the winding roads, heading towards our next destination.Cash-strapped Sri Lanka plunged into its worst financial crisis in more than seven decades in 2022, with a severe dollar shortage sending inflation soaring to a high of 70 percent, its currency to record lows, and its economy contracting 7.3 percent.Thanks to the growing number of tourists, Sri Lanka is now bouncing back.In Jetwing Lake, we met Kasun Pradeep Somasiri, a receptionist. He briefed us that the resort is now 50 percent occupied. “That’s a better figure now as we are recovering.”The travel and tourism sector is a significant income generator for Sri Lanka. However, the economic crisis, the Ukraine–Russia war, and China’s zero-Covid policy have jeopardised the industry.Tourism accounted for more than 12 percent of the country’s GDP in 2019 and was the third-largest source of foreign exchange reserves, behind worker remittances and the apparel industry.Sri Lanka was poised to be one of the world’s best holiday destinations due to its rich culture, wealth of natural resources, and diversity of accessible experiences.However, tourism-dependent Sri Lanka suffered its first major setback with the Easter bombings 2019. This led to the collapse of inbound tourism flows as international arrivals declined by 18 percent year-on-year, and tourist expenditure fell by 17.7 percent that year. This was immediately followed by two years of pandemic restrictions. Inbound visitors fell to just 116,600 in 2021.An acute balance of payments crisis forced Sri Lanka to preemptively default on foreign debt of over $50 billion in April 2022, triggering a crippling economic contraction with spiralling inflation.“Tourism is gaining momentum,” says Somasiri. “The British and Chinese have started to return to Sri Lanka.”January-August is the peak season for foreigners. “From December to April, local people travel for holiday purposes,” says Somasiri. Before we started the tour to other religious sites, our tour guide, Sampath Mayadunne, told us, “Don't take selfies with your back to Buddha.” Turning your back on a Buddha statue and some other religious sites to take photos and videos is a strict no-no.The most common sight across Sri Lanka is the tank cascades system, an ancient irrigation infrastructure. The system is a network of small tanks draining to large reservoirs that store rainwater and surface runoff for later use.“These infrastructures were built by its ancient kings over 2,000 years ago to solve the water scarcity in the country’s dry zone,” says Mayadunne.On day two, we travelled to Ranweli Spice Garden in Matale. This garden is famous for its rare spices and herbs. A tour of the gardens will show you the cultivation, harvesting, cleaning, and packaging process, as well as the health benefits and uses of the herbs.On the way, we saw a colourful Muthumariamman Hindu temple, boasting hundreds of detailed sculptures in a rich mosaic of colour.In Kandy, we visited the Temple of the Tooth Relic (Sri Dalada Maligawa), one of the most sacred places of worship in the Buddhist world. It was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1988.The temple sustained damage from bombings by Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna in 1989 and by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam in 1998. However, it was fully restored each time.We then headed to Jetwing St Andrew’s, a luxurious 5-star property in Sri Lanka’s hill country of Nuwara Eliya, situated at 1,900 metres above sea level. During our stay in Kandy, we immersed ourselves in the city's charm and the serenity of the countryside. On the third day, early morning, we travelled to Nuwara Eliya, the area famous for tea estates that give many Nepalis the feeling that they have come to Kanyam, Ilam, in eastern Nepal.We visited a tea factory called Damro Labookellie Tea Centre, the oldest tea centre in Sri Lanka. Due to its cold climate, it is the most important area for tea production in Sri Lanka.In this tea factory, they make white and black tea, while the green tea is processed in another tea factory and then sent to Damro.After the tea factory tour and the tea tasting, we headed to Galle, our next resting point.We encountered narrow, winding, and maze-like streets and alleys in Nuwara Eliya, known as ‘Little England’. The town has preserved almost all its British-era buildings and is calm and beautiful. On our way to Galle, at the roadside, our tour guide stopped us at the famed Sita temple, which has Hanuman's footprints and is the place where Sita, wife of Lord Rama, was held captive by the demon king Ravana after he abducted her from India.We were at Sita Eliya, a temple named Sri Seethai Amman.When we reached the Hindu temple, rich in vibrant colours and architectural elements, it was full of devotees. The water stream adjoining the temple is believed to be where Sita bathed. Large footprints are found on the stones in the stream, and there is a saying that those belong to Hanuman, who came spying to find Sita’s whereabouts.In Ella, Ravana’s waterfalls are significant in the Rama-Ravana story. The cascade charms visitors from all over the globe. The waterfall is easily accessible and is known to have hidden caves at the top, which are believed to have been used as Ravana's residence.The 25-metre-tall waterfall is a beautiful cascade that provides the perfect backdrop for a photo to remember your Ramayana trail adventures in Sri Lanka. A short pilgrimage tour ended there, and it was now time for an adventure. Though it was not part of our itinerary, our guide decided to tour us on a train ride.Though short, only six kilometres from Ella to Demodera, it was thrilling. Everyone screamed in unison like kids on a fair ride to hear the echoes in the dark every time we passed through the tunnels. The sound of the train is subtly different inside a tunnel. For the first-timer, the darkness and shouts inside the tunnels when the train passes would be scary, like a horror movie.The train we boarded wasn’t crowded, but people had already filled the doorway, ready for the scenic journey.With the shrill sound of a whistle, the train slowly pulled away from the platform at Ella, passing houses, coconut trees and green fields.As the train progressed, tourists and locals were leaning out the windows and crowding to hang out the doors. I joined the crowd and hung out on a train. A short excitement ended there.After lunch, we headed to Galle and reached Jetwing Lighthouse. As soon as our group entered the hotel, they shouted with excitement.The hotel is on a rocky outcrop three miles west of Galle. Waves crash over giant boulders in front of it and produce howling winds.We were at Galle’s 17th-century fort five minutes from the hotel on day four. In the Bay of Galle on the southwest coast of Sri Lanka, Galle Fort was built first in 1588 by the Portuguese and lavishly rebuilt by the Dutch during the 17th century. It is a historical, archaeological and architectural heritage monument that maintains a perfect appearance even after more than 436 years.We then reached Hikkaduwa Beach, a popular beach destination on the southern coast of Sri Lanka. On the way, we saw a 30-metre-high Big Buddha Statue. It is a replica of the 6th-century Buddhas of Bamiyan destroyed by the Taliban in Afghanistan. It was created using the earliest known sketches of the statue. It was built in remembrance of the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami victims.We then travelled through the 222-kilometre-long Southern Expressway, Sri Lanka's first expressway linking the capital, Colombo, with Galle, Matara, and Hambantota, significant cities south of the island.On day five, we reached Colombo, the capital of Sri Lanka. Jetwing Colombo Seven hosted us in the bustling capital. We took a city tour early morning and visited Bally's Casino at night.On day six, we returned to Kathmandu early in the morning on a Sri Lankan Airlines flight, the airline that organised the trip in coordination with Jetwing Hotels Limited, a Sri Lankan hotel chain.National flag carrier Nepal Airlines, in its previous avatar as Royal Nepal Airlines, used to operate direct flights to Colombo during the 1980s. However, the carrier suspended operations following an armed movement by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) in Sri Lanka. There had been no direct air links between the two countries for decades.In 2016, Himalaya Airlines started a chartered flight that lasted a few months due to low traffic movement between the two countries. Sri Lankan Airlines started operating direct flights to Kathmandu in August 2021.“The main objective of this media tour is to increase tourism in both countries for mutual benefit. We want to draw Nepalis for pilgrims and leisure activities,” says Nilina Pathirana, Country Manager at Srilankan Airlines in Nepal.“We have understood that Nepali travellers tend to travel to Bangkok, Vietnam, Malaysia, Dubai, and Maldives. Nepalis have quite minimal knowledge about Sri Lanka and the religious connection between Lanka and Nepal. We want to promote Nepal and Sri Lanka jointly. This will be a win-win business,” added Pathirana.The airline said it currently carries 60 percent of the passengers from Nepal to Sri Lanka and beyond destinations like Tokyo, Sydney, Melbourne, and other Middle Eastern destinations. The return airfare for a 3.5-hour-long flight starts at Rs74,000. “We have a four-night, five-day package that begins from Rs80,000, depending on the properties and extended itineraries,” says Pathirana.Nepalis must submit certain required documents for visa processing, like their passport copy and bank statement. Due to this government-to-government policy, only Nepalis must obtain a prior visa. Otherwise, Sri Lankans are required to have a visa upon arrival.“The other best thing is that Sri Lankan Airlines can be involved with the visa process or facilitate the Nepalis tourists. Our main intention is to have a sustainable market in Kathmandu and make it a daily flight,” says Pathirana. \nMundhum Trek in Koshi province in the eastern part of Nepal is a new cultural walking trail. It passes through several indigenous ethnic villages and landscapes in Khotang and Bhojpur districts. This trail goes up to an elevation of 4,200 metres to the viewpoint of Silchung Peak and takes one through the settlements of the Kirati people. This route starts from Diktel Bazaar and passes through beautiful settlements like Chakhewa, Rawa Dhap, Salpa Bhanjyang, Silchung and Hanspokhari before ending in Bhojpur. There are some hotels in Diktel but trekkers are advised to carry tents. The trail offers panoramic views of most of the eight-thousanders, including Everest, Lhotse, Makalu, Cho Oyu and Kanchenjunga mountains. The spring season, March through May, is highly recommended for the trek.Janaki Mandir Janaki Mandir at Janakpur in Madhesh province was constructed in 1874 and is a blend of Mughal and local architecture. The temple is a three-storey building and has 60 rooms, making it the largest temple in Nepal. Pilgrims flock here by the thousands to pay homage to Janaki Mandir—Janaki being the other name of Sita, the daughter of King Janak. The temple houses an idol of Sita which was found near Ayodhya, the kingdom of Ram. The marriage anniversary of Lord Ram and Sita is celebrated in Janakpur every year on Vivaha Panchami, which falls in December. In the southwest corner of Janaki Mandir is the Vivaha Mandap, which has been built at the site where the marriage of Ram and Sita is said to have taken place. Another well-known temple in the vicinity is Ram Mandir, which is built in pagoda style and is hence different from the other temples in Janakpur that generally bear resemblance to Mughal architecture. It houses a female statue, said to be of Yogamaya, which has the reputation of being one of the most beautiful images of female forms in Nepal. Other holy sites of interest include the Laxman Temple, Sankat Mochan Temple and Hanuman Temple.Kuri Village, Kalinchok Kuri village, a popular tourist destination around 150 km from Kathmandu, lies at an altitude of 3,842 metres above sea level in Kalinchowk of Dolakha district, in Bagmati province. People visit the place to enjoy the snow during the winter besides the mesmerising landscapes and splendid panoramic view of the Himalayan range. Kalinchok gets snow mainly at the end of December and the snowfall continues till the end of February or mid-March. When there is snow, it is difficult for jeeps, buses and cars to reach the top of Kuri village. Chains are wrapped around the wheels of vehicles and specially modified jeeps with highly experienced drivers are used to carry visitors. There are several hotels and restaurants in the area. The road up to Kuri has also improved over the years.Annapurna Base Camp Annapurna Base Camp trek, in Gandaki province, makes for a picturesque journey that takes you to the foothills of the Annapurna South, up to 4,130 metres above sea level. The five-day trek (seven days for slow walkers) offers rich cultural diversities, typical Nepali villages and the flora and fauna nestled at the foothills of Annapurna. The distance from Pokhara to Annapurna Base Camp is approximately 81 kilometres. It is among the shortest and most budget-friendly treks in Nepal. For Nepalis, lodging costs around $5 to $10 per day. For foreigners, the overall cost of the trek ranges from $800 to $1500 on average per person. Annapurna Base Camp trek can be done at any time throughout the year as each season offers a different trekking experience. The ideal time for the trek depends on your weather preferences and what you expect from it. However, autumn (September to October) and spring (March to May) are considered the two best seasons for the trek, as the days at the time are warm and bright with clear skies.Bardiya National Park Bardiya National Park, located in the southern Tarai belt of Lumbini province, is home to one of the most elusive and majestic animals on earth—the Royal Bengal Tiger. The park, which covers an area of 968 square kilometres, is considered one of the most important protected areas in the country. It is a prime destination for those looking to catch a glimpse of a tiger. A bit of luck and patience will offer a good chance to see the Bengal Tiger. The jungle safari also offers one the opportunity to spot Asian elephants and the greater one-horned rhinoceros. The rare Gangetic river dolphins are occasionally spotted on rafting trips along the Geruwa River, the eastern channel of the Karnali river. Besides, visitors can enjoy the homestays and explore local Tharu culture. The right time to visit the park is from mid-September to mid-December and mid-February to May.Khaptad National Park Khaptad National Park in Sudurpaschim province is a protected area in the far western region. It stretches over four districts of Bajhang, Bajura, Achham and Doti and ranges in elevation from 1,400 to 3,300 metres. The park can be visited throughout the year. Trekkers are advised to bring their tents, food and other supplies. The Nepal Tourism Board says of late, social media has been increasingly influencing Nepali travellers to go to Khaptad. Since the far-flung Khaptad National Park is still offbeat for many travellers, the area remains pristine and fresh. The seasons of spring (March-May) and autumn (October-November) are the ideal times to visit the park. The temperature ranges from 10°c to 20°c offering pleasant trekking weather. The monsoon begins in June and lasts until September and during this time, roads often become muddy and slippery. From December to February, winter brings snow and chilling winds to the park.Limi Valley \nOnce again, my heart swelled with joy when my hometown came into view.Arriving at Lalikharka after the treacherous journey through Pauwa Bhanjyang and the bustling Kanchhi Dokan, Phidim, the headquarters of Panchthar district, revealed itself like a surprise gift. My home town, Phidim, is unique in the fact that it reveals to travellers approaching it from uphill. As the vehicle descends the mountain road, it slowly comes into view, its houses and buildings recognisable for the native son.This Dashain, I undertook the much-awaited trip to my hometown with my wife Kabita and daughter Aarohi. Little did I anticipate the transformation that awaited me.The moment I got out of the jeep, I noticed that Phidim, nestled in the lush hills, has undergone a remarkable transformation over the years. As I guided my family to my home, which had suffered damages in the 1989 quake that struck eastern Nepal, I found that old, mud and stone houses had been replaced by concrete buildings. The place was vastly different from the one I remembered.Arriving at my childhood home felt like reuniting with an old friend. Navigating its nooks and crannies with my daughter, we delved into the history of the house, a symbol of my cherished memories.My wife had visited Phidim years ago, spending a month with my parents. She, too, recalled beautiful moments she had had in the town. I asked the tenant about the neighbours and acquaintances. Some had died, while others had left for good.A call to local journalist Giriraj Banskota led me to the school grounds, where memories flooded back. This was where I spent my teenage years, playing ball, learning to kick, and watching major tournaments. Here, I even encountered a group of Western climbers headed to Kanchenjunga, the world’s third-highest mountain. I remember being awed by their shiny yellow tents, headlights and strange smell. I remember practising my tutephuteko Angrezi with the climbers. Birendra Shield, an annual sports tournament named after the late king, brought ace players from various schools in Panchthar district. The district also hosted Yuba Mela, an annual three-day fair to commemorate the birthday of the king, organising football tournaments in which teams from as far as Sunsari and Taplejung participated. I never excelled at dribbling balls. A boy growing up in a seven-member family, I soon found my interest in literature. In the late 1980s, Phidim hosted a major literary festival. In the run-up to the 1990 pro-democracy protest, walls were painted with anti-monarchy slogans, local politicians were arrested. I took my family to my school, Naya Namuna Secondary School. It was Saturday, so the school was closed. I peeked through the steel gate and wall, imagining myself labouring over classes. Memories are hazy, but what I remember most is going out of the school—to quiz contests with me leading the school team, to essay competitions at the District Education Office and to play carom board, a national pastime, in a nearby shopfront. Returning to the main street, the demolition of a landmark gate made me reflect on how cities transform, shedding old landmarks for new identities. Navigating narrow alleyways, I felt like a stranger in my own hometown. Multistory buildings have emerged and roads have been paved, reshaping the town. It’s the same place with a different face, leaving me nostalgic for the Phidim of my memories.We finally reached Shivalaya temple, which I told my wife and daughter was one of my cherished hangouts. A giant statue of Falgunanda (the Kirant leader’s birthday is celebrated on November 10) stood before the steps to the temple. Though my wife suspected I came here to smoke, in reality, I visited the temple in the evening to meet friends and talk about issues that mattered most to us at the time. It also offered a panoramic view of the town (I could not take my family to Gadhi Danda, a hillock across the Shivalaya).Towards the end of my journey, I felt sad about Phidim’s lack of prospects. To my dismay, I found that people have been leaving the town in droves. Despite blacktopped roads and multi-story buildings, Phidim faces a troubling reality. The lack of quality higher education and specialist healthcare has driven people away, echoing the circumstances that led me to Kathmandu years ago. Conversations with locals confirmed a mass exodus from the town, a trend that raises concerns about Phidim's future.My conversations with familiar strangers led me to conclude that Phidim has transformed into a transit town for pilgrims heading to Pathibhara Devi Temple, which is around 255 kilometres north in Taplejung district. I met dozens of people headed to the holy site. While pilgrims see it as a stopover, for me, it was a homecoming. The realisation dawned that Phidim is, perhaps, in a state of transition, trading its rustic charm for the hallmarks of urbanisation. While I left Phidim for higher education in Kathmandu, people from rural areas have flocked to the town in search of better opportunities, bringing life and energy to the once quiet community.As we bid adieu to my hometown, I couldn’t help but reflect on the inevitability of leaving a place, no matter how enamoured one is with it. Passing Kanchhi Dokan, I pointed out Kanchnajungha and Kumbhakarna to my daughter—symbols of my childhood. Phidim, now a blend of nostalgia and change, remains etched in my heart, a testament to the intricate dance between memory and evolution. \nUnilever Nepal, through its personal care brand Dove, officially sponsored Nepal’s National Women’s Football Team by presenting exclusive travel kits to 27 players and officials at the All Nepal Football Association (ANFA) office. This initiative highlighted Dove’s commitment to supporting the athletes on their journey to success, focusing on care, empowerment, and confidence.Dove aimed to strengthen its presence in football culture through a long-term, values-driven partnership, promoting women’s football and aligning with major tournaments such as the FIFA Women’s World Cup.Unilever Nepal hoped to foster positive societal change, creating emotional connections with audiences and building sustainable initiatives that extended beyond traditional sponsorships.As Nepali women continued to make strides in various sectors, Unilever Nepal recognised the potential of the national women's football team to inspire the future of women's athletics. \nLionel Messi scored his 10th international hat-trick and had a hand in two more goals as Argentina thrashed Bolivia 6-0 in South American qualifiers for the 2026 World Cup in front of an adoring home crowd at the Monumental stadium on Tuesday.Making only his second international appearance since recovering from an injury sustained at the Copa America in July, Messi capitalised on a mistake by defender Marcelo Suarez to open the scoring in the 19th minute.Bolivia goalkeeper Guillermo Viscarra made a couple of fine saves to prevent the hosts from extending their lead but he was beaten in the 43rd minute when Lautaro Martinez scored from Messi’s quick cross.Argentina made it 3-0 just before the break, with Messi setting up Julian Alvarez to score.Lionel Scaloni’s side controlled the second half and looked like they had extended their lead through Nicolas Otamendi, only to see the goal disallowed for offside.Substitute Thiago Almada did make it 4-0, however, scoring from Nahuel Molina’s pass in the 70th minute with the venue transformed into an Argentine party.Messi, 37, gave fans more reason to celebrate in the closing moments, beating two Bolivia defenders before unleashing a fierce shot past Viscarra to score his second.Messi needed only two more minutes to complete the hat-trick, joining Portugal’s Cristiano Ronaldo with the most in men’s internationals, the Argentine skipper scoring with a left-footed drive to take his tally to 112 goals for his country.“It’s really nice to come here, to feel the affection of the people, it moves me how they shout my name,” Messi said.“This drives me. Enjoying being happy where I am. Despite my age, when I’m here, I feel like a kid because I’m comfortable with this team. As long as I feel good and can keep performing the way I want, I’ll keep enjoying it.”Argentina are top of the standings with 22 points, having returned to winning ways after losing to Colombia last month and drawing with Venezuela last week.The 2026 World Cup will be hosted by the United States, Mexico and Canada. \nThe world’s largest technology firms are flocking to Southeast Asia to build data centres at a time when demand for infrastructure and computing power to enable artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly rising.The new investments are expected to contribute to the region’s economies by creating skilled jobs in data centre construction, engineering and maintenance, while also developing specialised talent in AI, cyber security, and data science and management.The investments will also improve the region’s digital infrastructure, allowing small businesses and large institutions to store their data locally, significantly reducing downtime while increasing data sovereignty.With AI-supported innovations such as searches on ChatGPT now requiring at least four to five times more processing capacity compared with traditional internet searches, data centre demand is expected to grow at around 20 per cent a year for the next five to seven years, analysts at Maybank noted in an October report.Data centres are large facilities built to accommodate servers, data storage systems and networking equipment that support better internet services and telecommunications.This, in turn, enables popular online activities such as gaming, live-streaming and investing, as well as more advanced technologies like cloud computing and AI.Thanks to its lower costs, power availability and geopolitical neutrality, South-east Asia is emerging as an ideal region for tech operators to establish a data centre base, with the top five countries being Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia and Vietnam.While Singapore is the preferred destination for hosting data centres due to superior infrastructure and a stable regulatory regime, the Republic had imposed a three-year halt on data centre construction between 2019 and 2022 to assess its impact on the environment.Malaysia seized the bulk of new data centre investments entering the region during that period, and now expects facilities with around one gigawatt (GW) of power capacity to come online over the next two years.That is double the existing data centre capacity it currently has.Another 3GW has also been announced and, if approved, will be gradually rolled out in the next three to five years, RHB Bank said.In comparison, Singapore’s data centre capacity currently stands at around 1.4GW.Among those channelling capital into Malaysia are tech titans like Microsoft, which said in May that it will invest US$2.2 billion (S$2.9 billion) over the next four years to build cloud and AI infrastructure in the country.Amazon Web Services (AWS) in August announced plans to invest an estimated US$6.2 billion to set up a data centre and cloud region in Malaysia.More On This TopicSingapore has one of the world’s densest data centre capacities: Josephine TeoMalaysia plans national cloud policy, AI regulations as Google breaks ground on $2.57b data centreThe cloud service provider is also developing a similar region in Thailand. It revealed plans in 2024 to invest US$5 billion in data centres in the country over the next few years, making Thailand its fourth AWS region in Asean after Singapore, Indonesia and Malaysia.In September, Google said it would invest US$1 billion to build a data centre and cloud region in Thailand, which has so far seen around US$9 billion committed by operators, according to analysts at Morgan Stanley.By 2028, RHB expects Malaysia to account for over half the data centre processing power across the top five South-east Asian markets, with data centres in Johor making up the bulk of inventories at over 2.3GW.That could put the Malaysian state in close competition with Singapore as a data centre hub for the region.After partially lifting its moratorium in 2022, Singapore awarded around 80MW of new capacity to Equinix, GDS, Microsoft and an AirTrunk-ByteDance consortium in July 2023. In May, the Government announced that at least 300MW of data centre capacity may soon be provided.Still, the Republic has signalled that it will be more selective when awarding new capacity moving forward.Speaking at a conference in May, then Senior Minister of State for Communications and Information Janil Puthucheary said data centres are collectively Singapore’s biggest indirect carbon emitter.He added that existing data centres currently contribute to 82 per cent of the information and communications sector’s carbon emissions, and 7 per cent of the country’s total electricity consumption.However, Dr Janil said Singapore may still award an additional 200MW of capacity to operators that are able to tap green sources of energy to run the facilities, and will provide schemes and incentives to support such investments.Mr Dedi Iskandar, head of data centre solutions at property investment adviser CBRE, asked that the authorities provide more clarity on this front.“The industry does not have a clear picture of what’s next after the additional capacity was announced in May, or when we can bid or how. We haven’t seen this information coming, and that has created uncertainty,” he said.“When data centre operators have no line of sight, they cannot make plans to invest in Singapore.”Mr Dedi said that while Singapore is still the preferred destination for hosting mission-critical computing applications, Johor, which still struggles with issues like talent and water shortages, is improving quickly.The highest risk for Singapore arises when the price gap for building and operating a data centre compared with Johor becomes too significant, and when the quality of data centre services between the two markets narrows, he said. \nFormer One Direction singer Liam Payne was found dead outside a hotel in Buenos Aires after the 31-year-old fell from his third-floor room balcony, Argentine police said on Wednesday.In a statement, the capital police said they were called to the hotel in the capital’s leafy Palermo neighborhood where they were notified of an “aggressive man who could be under the effects of drugs and alcohol.”The hotel manager said he heard a loud noise at the back of the hotel, and when police arrived they found that a man had fallen over the balcony in his room, the statement said.Emergency workers confirmed the death of the British singer, who was reportedly found in the hotel’s interior patio.“I am in shock right now. Liam was always so kind to me,” American singer Charlie Puth said on Instagram. “He was one of the first major artists I got to work with. I cannot believe he is gone.”US music channel MTV, streaming service Spotify (SPOT.N), and the BRITs British music awards all expressed their grief on social media, sending their condolences to his family and loved ones.Payne had a son named Bear with British TV personality and Girls Aloud singer Cheryl in 2017.Neither Payne’s record label Republic Records, nor its owner Universal Music Group (UMG.AS), could immediately be reached for comment.Police had received a call from a worker at the hotel requesting urgent help with an intoxicated guest, according to audio related to the case obtained from the Buenos Aires security ministry.“When he is conscious he is destroying the entire room and we need you to send someone,” the worker said, adding that the guest’s life was at risk because their room had a balcony.Emergency responders removed the body from the hotel to take to the morgue, while fans and onlookers who had gathered through the early evening, some hugging each other and crying, burst into applause.Crowd gathers to mourn boy band starThe “For You” singer rose to global fame as part of the since-disbanded pop band One Direction, alongside Harry Styles, Zayn Malik, Niall Horan and Louis Tomlinson.The boy band got its start after finishing third on the British version of the X Factor music competition show in 2010, but the group broke up in 2016 as its members pursued different projects including solo careers.One Direction was ranked the third best boy band ever by Entertainment Weekly in 2024. The group won dozens of major awards and sold some 70 million records worldwide, making them one of the best-selling boy bands of all time.According to Celebrity Net Worth, Payne’s One Direction and solo career helped garner him a net worth of some $70 million.Reuters reporters at the scene saw crowds gathering outside the hotel, where dozens of police and emergency services teams had cordoned off an area as night fell on the city.One 25-year-old fan, Yamila Zacarias, said her family had made a lot of effort so she could see One Direction when they came to Argentina, but she had decided not to go as her parents didn’t have much money then.“He meant a lot to me because the band came into my life at this time when you’re trying to be a part of something, and being a One Direction fan became that something for me,” she said. “This was the only time I could applaud him.”Violeta Antier, another fan, told Reuters she had come straight away after he sister told her Payne had died.“I saw him two weeks ago at a Niall (Horan) concert, another One Direction member. He was there, I saw him,” she said.“He was ok.”Payne had on Oct. 2 attended the Buenos Aires concert of his former bandmate Niall Horan on the Argentine leg of a Latin American tour that spanned Mexico, Brazil, Chile, Peru and Colombia. The two had posted videos together and with fans.Payne, who co-wrote many One Direction songs including “Night Changes” and “Story of my Life”, had previously spoken publicly about his struggles with mental health and using alcohol to cope with the pressures of fame.Last year he published a video to fans on his YouTube channel in which he spoke about his family, making new art and performing again after having given up alcohol. He thanked supporters for sticking with him through difficult times.Earlier on Wednesday, Payne had appeared to post on Snapchat about his trip in Argentina, talking about riding horses, playing polo, and looking forward to returning home to see his dog.“It’s a lovely day here in Argentina,” he said in the video. \nCanadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Wednesday said India made “a horrific mistake” by thinking it could interfere as aggressively as it allegedly did in Canada’s sovereignty.Trudeau made the remark two days after Canada kicked out six Indian diplomats, linking them to the murder of a Sikh separatist leader in Canada and alleging a broader effort to target Indian dissidents in the country.The Canadian leader’s comments were the strongest he has made in a year-long dispute that plunged bilateral relations to a new low.“The Indian government made a horrific mistake in thinking that they could interfere as aggressively as they did in the safety and sovereignty of Canada,” he told an independent probe into foreign interference in Canadian politics.Trudeau said Ottawa could take further steps to ensure Canadians’ security but declined to give details.India denies the allegations of interference and has expelled six Canadian diplomats in a tit-for-tat move. \nIn his final months in office, President Joe Biden is signaling new willingness to use US military assistance to Israel as both a carrot and a stick to influence its high-stakes confrontation with Iran and Iran-backed militant groups.But while the approach increases Washington’s involvement in Israeli decision-making just weeks before the US presidential election, it is unclear whether it will help achieve Biden’s goals, including preventing a broader regional conflict and getting Israel to address the increasingly dire humanitarian situation in Gaza, experts say.Biden’s administration announced on Sunday it would send about 100 soldiers to Israel along with an advanced US anti-missile system, a rare deployment that came as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s government weighs a retaliatory attack on Iran after an Oct. 1 Iranian missile strike.The Biden administration also delivered Israel a letter on Sunday warning that it must take steps in the next month to improve the humanitarian situation in Gaza or face potential restrictions on US military aidBiden’s administration announced on Sunday it would send about 100 soldiers to Israel along with an advanced US anti-missile system, a rare deployment that came as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s government weighs a retaliatory attack on Iran after an Oct. 1 Iranian missile strike.The Biden administration also delivered Israel a letter on Sunday warning that it must take steps in the next month to improve the humanitarian situation in Gaza or face potential restrictions on US military aid.Publicly, US officials say the seemingly opposing moves fit within longstanding policies that aim to both ensure Israel’s defense and to advocate for protection of civilians in the year-old war in Gaza.But current and former officials privately acknowledge that they are milestones that increase US involvement in Israeli strategy even as Biden heads for the door.Israel has frequently resisted US advice and has caused political difficulties for the Biden administration, which faces pressure from some liberal activists in the Democratic Party to use US leverage to rein in Israel.Aaron David Miller, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said that the administration’s carrot-and-stick approach “implies at a time when you might not think the administration is all that active … that they are clearly thinking and acting.”But he cautioned that Washington is unlikely to scale back its military support for Israel if the conflict with Iran deepens.“It is almost inconceivable to me as we approach the possibility of a severe and serious escalation – the Israeli response and what the Iranians will do in return – that this administration could consider anything like a serious restriction or conditioning of military systems,” he said.White House spokesperson John Kirby told reporters on Tuesday that the letter was not “meant as a threat” but that it appears the Israelis are taking the issues seriously.An Israeli official in Washington said: “The letter has been received and is being thoroughly reviewed by Israeli security officials.”Israel said Wednesday that 50 aid trucks were transferred to north Gaza from Jordan, a possible early result of the US demands.A DEADLINE TO INCREASE AIDBiden has prioritized Israel’s defense since Hamas militants triggered the war by killing some 1,200 people, according to Israeli figures. He refused to halt weapons flows to Israel, except for 2,000-pound bombs, despite outcry by fellow Democrats as Israel’s war in Gaza killed 42,000 people, according to Palestinian health authorities.The administration in April demanded better protections for civilians and aid workers in Gaza, which US officials say produced a temporary rise in aid flows into the territory.But Sunday’s letter appeared to be the clearest ultimatum yet to Netanyahu’s government since the Gaza conflict began, outlining specific steps Israel must take within 30 days, including enabling a minimum of 350 trucks with aid to enter Gaza per day.It raises the possibility of Washington making Israel ineligible to receive US weapons over its restrictions on aid delivery, said John Ramming Chappell, advocacy and legal advisor at the Center for Civilians in Conflict.“It is a small step towards a very significant change,” he said.Netanyahu convened an emergency meeting on Wednesday to discuss expanding humanitarian aid to Gaza, three officials who attended the discussion said, with aid likely to increase soon.The decision to send the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense system, or THAAD, is a similarly major step, said former officials and analysts, in line with a strategy of offering the Israelis close military support with the aim of influencing how they conduct military operations.A former defense official described the deployment as a “paradigm shift,” given Israel’s long-standing security doctrine to defend itself, by itself. It also raises the stakes, potentially, for the United States.“The US is putting actual US ‘skin in the game’ by placing US forces inside Israel, that only 2 weeks ago was on the receiving end of 180 Iranian ballistic missiles,” the official said.The Middle East has been on edge awaiting Israel’s response to a missile attack earlier this month that Tehran carried out in retaliation for Israel’s military escalation in Lebanon.Biden has objected to any Israeli strike on Iran’s nuclear sites and expressed concern about a strike on energy sites.“This is probably a carrot to try to cajole the Israelis to not go big,” said Thomas Karako, director of the missile defense project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, referring to the possibility that Israel could choose to strike nuclear and other targets.“And, you know, you don’t send a multi-billion dollar asset without some strings attached.”The White House did not directly respond to a question on whether sending the THAAD to Israel may have been part of a deal for the Israelis to agree not to hit Iranian oil or nuclear sites.Time is running short for the administration.The 30 days Biden has given Israel to comply with its demands will run out after the Nov. 5 US election, giving Netanyahu the ability to decide how fully he should comply, said Miller, especially if the Republican candidate with whom he is close, former President Donald Trump, defeats the Democrat, Vice President Kamala Harris.“Netanyahu believes he is at the point of maximum leverage, and he may well be. You may have a new president-elect that is much more to his liking in a matter of weeks,” Miller added. \nChaaaiiittt…The spontaneous eruption of the sound of victory thundered through the neighbourhood of Nhyokha in the Kathmandu core. The line of a kite cut another. Looking out the window of her house, Sajani Shrestha saw children running full speed, shouting and fighting as they vied to catch the falling kite and thread. And craning her neck up to the sky, she could not count but only be mesmerised by the innumerable kites strewn across the skies of Nhyokha, Bangemudha, Indrachowk. “There would be so many kites that they entirely covered the blue of the sky, making beautiful patterns of different colours,” says the 51-year-old. “And you cannot imagine the number of times the call of chait rang in the air.”Clear blue sky and gentle westerlies, the season of kites has arrived in the Kathmandu Valley. While kites soared Kathmandu's sky mainly during Dashain, the kite season officially started in Nag Panchami (August) and ended on the Haribodhini Ekadashi (November). And from royalities to commoners, young and old all flew kites from rooftops and open grounds. Even those who did not, like Sajani, revelled in the live spectacle in the sky as kites soared and fought. With Bhimsen Thapa’s help, King Girvanyuddha flies kites The earliest written account of kite flying is believed to date to 200 BC in China. In Kathmandu, this tradition has religious and socio-cultural and environmental significance, says Tina Manandhar, lecturer of Nepalese History, Culture and Archaeology at Tribhuvan University. According to her, it is believed that kites in Kathmandu skies carry a message to the god of rain Indra that the valley's farmers have had enough rain for their crops. That is why Kathmandu farmers scolded anyone flying kites before plantation season.In an article ‘Changako Utpati Ra Bikas’ published in Gorkhapatra in 1995, historian Rajesh Gautam points to the lack of written documents indicating the exact time when kite culture was introduced in Nepal. Exploring different opinions on kite's introduction to Nepal, he writes that “some have opined the possibility that the skill and tradition of kite flying might have entered Nepal through India.” Yet some others, he writes, state that kites “came to Nepal from Japan during the time of [Rana PM] Dev Shumsher.”He concludes that most likely this tradition was introduced by Malla-era Newar traders: “But since Nepal’s relationship with Tibet and China is very old and direct, kites might have entered Nepal through the Newar traders who were engaged in the trade. One can estimate that the kite was introduced to Nepal during the (mediaeval) Malla regime.”In Social History of Nepal, TR Vaidya, Tri Ratna Manandhar and Shankar Lal Joshi write that there exists documented evidence of the kite flying from the early 19th century. The authors state that Sundarananda, a contemporary poet, has mentioned that the young king Girvanyuddha Bikram Shah (r.1799-1816), with the help of Prime Minister Bhimsen Thapa, flew kites from the towering temple of Taleju Bhawani, Hanumandhoka. And when the king's kite cut the kites of the youngsters, they were located and rewarded with money.In Tyas Bakhatko Nepal, Sardar Bhim Bahadur Pandey states that “During the month of Kartik [October-November] young and old all flew kites,” suggesting that kite culture was ubiquitous in Kathmandu by the early twentieth century.Anticipations and preparationsKite flying in Nepal requires a kite, a lattai (a wooden spool), thread and majha (homemade adhesive prepared by boiling snail slime, rice or sago, and powdered glass from burnt electric bulbs and coated on the line to sharpen it for kite fighting).77-year-old Nirmal Man Tuladhar, an avid kite flyer and retired professor of Linguistics at the Tribhuvan University, explains how Nepali tradition of kite flying was both expensive and needing advance preparation.“In our times, it wasn’t easy to fly kites,” he says. “We had to prepare majha …And as Nepali kites are fighter kites, we mainly fought with other kites [which meant we spent a lot of threads].”This preparation needed first and foremost of passing a hurdle: securing finances and materials to fly kites. While lattai was a one-time investment that could be saved for years, kites and threads had to be replenished every time a kite was cut.“Those were the times when parents wanted us to be more focused in our studies. They only gave money [to buy kites] after immense pestering,” says 80-year-old Dwarika Nath Dhungel, former Secretary of Nepal government, speaking of the 1950s and 1960s.Biodiversity specialist and botanist Tirtha Bahadur Shrestha, 86, was born in Mahabouddha and began flying kites from 1951-52. He saved what little money he got for afternoon snacks to buy Hattimar reel, a brand of line wound in a small lattai, which was strong and sharp and where majha stuck well.Raghuji Pant, a member of parliament, also recalls the difficulty in securing money to sustain his kite flying in and around Kathmandu core in the 1960s and early 1970s. “Four to five of my kites were cut in a day,” writes the 67-year-old in his 2019 article “Changa Jastai Udi Hidne Man” published in Himalkhabar. “[This caused] the line in the spool to shorten. From Bhadra [August-September] to one to one and a half months after Dashain I spent flying kites. So, it was difficult for me to have enough kites even after getting money from grandfather, grandmother, mother and everyone.”Kites and thread secured, now began the crucial work of preparing and applying majha whose strength determined how well it cut other kites. Govinda Tandon, 70, a historian and heritage expert, who grew up in Battisputali, was also an ardent kite flyer.“Materials for making majha were prepared right from the morning on a holiday,\" he writes in his article “Dashainko Butte Changa” published in Gorkhapatra. “Because this work couldn’t be accomplished without a collaboration of 3-4 friends, a holiday was set aside for this. Moreover, a sunny day was considered appropriate. If the majha didn’t dry, the thread could turn moist, and so if it felt like the day wouldn’t be sunny, the entire plan…was aborted.”Kite makers, kite sellers and variety of kites One of the oldest shops in Kathmandu's memory, Shree Chitrakar Kite Center in Tyauda, Asan is bustling with customers during Dashain. “When my grandmother got married and came to this house at age 12 [in early 1940s], this shop was already here,” says its fourth generation owner 47-year-old Dinoj Chitrakar. “So the shop must be around a hundred years old.”Another shop that stands out in Kathmandu's memory is Manandhar Kite Center in Kalimati, established in 1949, and currently run by brothers Mohan Man and Sundar Man Manandhar.In his book Antar Taranga, artist and writer Manuj Babu Mishra recalls “a kite shop near the old halwai shop of Chabahil” in the 1940s. Dhungel and his 1960 batchmates of Juddhodaya Public School recall the kite shops from the 1950s and 1960s – Bekhacha’s Shop at Netapacho, Bhaicha’s Shop at Nhyokha, Lata Manandhar’s Shop at Maru, Kanchha Buddha Bajracharya Shop at Tyauda.Besides the shops, there were makers and sellers of kites cloistered in different localities of Kathmandu Valley.In Kwalkhu, Patan was a Joshi who made Nepali paper kites.“One day I accompanied my uncle to buy kites,\" writes Dibya Giri, 69, in his 2023 article “Changa” in Sahitya Post. “I was amazed to see the huge stacks of kites there. We used to call it the house of the kite maker.”In Nhyokha, Purna Bahadur Shrestha began making kites as a teenager and started his own kite business in the 1950s, according to his daughter Sajani.These kites, made out of Nepali paper, often had different paintings. Mishra recalls painting kites for the kite shop in Chabahil.“I went to that kite shop and with the freely available colours and Nepali papers, I spent my day painting faces, birds, animals, masks, mountains, hills, whatever came to my mind,” he writes in the book. “Such kites apparently sold well!”Most septuagenarians and older generations like Tuladhar and Tirtha Bahadur recall flying kites made of Nepali paper when young. Tirtha Bahadur says that kites from Lucknow began coming to Kathmandu only after the late 1950s. But at least a section of Kathmandu was flying kites from Lucknow from the early twentieth century. Vaidya, Manandhar and Joshi write that the Ranas and Shahs imported kites from Lucknow and that from them, their favourite employees also got to fly some. These kites were large and, in Tyas Bakhatko Nepal, Pande writes that they were referred to as Lucknowia kites.Known for their characteristic hissing sound they made while flying, light body, swift movement and ability to take sharp turns, Lucknow kites were preferred by kite fighters.“Lucknow kites were lighter and could be manoeuvred well,” says Tuladhar. “Kites of Nepali paper were stable but difficult to manoeuvre. They were also expensive. So only some fighters flew Nepali paper kites.”The kites had different names depending upon their designs and colours – Ambe (a heart in the centre), Dibdibe (chequered), Pakhete (a different coloured paper on one edge), Sete (white-coloured), Nilchi (blue-coloured), Rate (red-coloured) and so on.The kite fighters preferred the strong and sharp Hattimar reel that came on a small lattai. The Belchamar reel was cheaper but weaker and prone to be cut by other threads. Kite fliers and kite watchers on rooftops and open groundsBibek Shrestha, 57, and his two brothers took stacks of kites and climbed their rooftops. The rooftops around theirs in the neighbourhood of Nhyokha – in fact in all core settlements of the Valley – were filled with kite fliers and spectators. Many risked precariously balancing on the sloped roofs.While Bibek and his brothers’ kites alighted to meet the sea of kites in the sky, their sister Sajani and other family members gathered around to revel in the live spectacle.Dhungel remembers the rooftops of Jhochhen and surroundings of the 1950s and 1960s swelled with kite fliers. Dhungel did try to fly kites. But he did not become a successful kite flyer. What he did become was, like Sajani and many Kathmandu residents, an admirer of kites soaring in the sky.“But more than engaging in my unsuccessful kite flying attempts, I enjoyed looking at the kites flying. There would be a big crowd of spectators. Females and other family members watched the kites fly as they ate meat and chiura. Some even drank and rejoiced as they flew kites.”When the age of cassette player and speakers dawned in the 1980s, songs blared from the speakers alongside kite flying. Chitrakar and Bibek invited their friends, put their favourite songs on speakers and spent entire afternoons flying kites, dancing, singing and eating.Away from the core cities, in the villages in the Valley, people flew kites in open fields. Like Dibya, who set his kite for flight from the banks of Godavari River in Tikathali. Chhauni was also a popular space for flying kites.Kathmandu’s joy in kite fightingBibek pulled his kite down and then manoeuvred it back up so his line touched his opponent's line from below and quickly reeled out his line. The resulting sharpness from the speed cut the opponent's line.Chaaaiiitttt………“The greatest fun comes from cutting another kite's string,” writes Tuladhar in his 1996 article “Cutting is the greatest fun” published in magazine Kite Lines. “With its coating of adhesive paste and ground glass, the string is as sharp and abrasive as sandpaper on your opponent's line.”Nepali kite, Tuladhar says, is made to fight other kites, and describes how a kite line cuts the other.“The technique is to touch your rival's string and immediately reel out line at high speed,” he writes. “The Nepalese style of kite flying is aggressive, and though the kites look simple, they are strategically designed for bringing down other kites.”At any given time, like Bibek’s kite above Nhyokha sky, skies above the Valley were filled with raging kites, swinging, coming down and going up as the fighters reeled in and out their lattais in ferocious attempts to bring down other kites.Meanwhile spectators cheered. “Even passersby stopped to look at the kites,” recalls Tina.The moment of a kite cutting was accompanied by the sound of chait, and children ran in the direction of the falling kite to grab it and the thread in what was termed as, Dibya says, changa lutne/dhago lutne.Dhungel always joined in to shout the chait resounding through the locality of Jhochhen and almost automatically his feet sped towards the severed kites' direction.“‘Oii leave that thread,’ the kite owner would scold me. ‘Why do you pull my thread, leave it right now.’ But I’d continue pulling the threads as the owner continued shouting. Other times I caught the kites that had failed to fly and dropped on the ground.”The fallen kites got stuck in the buildings, trees or poles, or glided down in the open grounds or paddy fields. Falling kites from the Kathmandu core settled down in Tundikhel covering it. Oftentimes kites fell on the fields to rest upon the lush paddy nearing its harvest.“Children ran straight into the fields to catch the kite,” says Dibya. \"They destroyed the crops by stepping on them. Some farmers chased them, scolding along as they did so and if they caught anyone, they slapped them.”Love and restrictions on kiteAmidst the raging kite fights high up in the sky, there were apparently also some quieter kites lingering much lower among the buildings or tree lines, for their goals lay in not ruthlessly cutting the threads of other kites but piercing softly through the hearts of their owners' love interests. During the Rana regime, there were designated public spaces to fly kites, writes Gautam in his article. Referring to oral accounts, he writes that the Ranas were particularly careful to avoid kite flyers around their durbars. This is because love-stricken men tied letters to kites and flew them into the durbars to their love interests among the nanis.He writes that the kites could be flown mainly on the grounds of Chhauni. Anyone flying kites in any other place and around Rana durbars were arrested.Pant also recalls love-stricken boys from his time. “Just as kites came in different colours and patterns, so did kite flyers,” he writes in the article. “Some wrote love letters using a few words in “symbolic language” on a plain kite and attempted to land it on the rooftop of the girl they liked. Some simply landed their kites on any rooftop if a girl appeared there and waited for reaction.”King Tribhuvan among kite fliersPande writes in his book: “Once or twice during kite season every year, King Tribhuvan went to Chhauni to fly kites. Legend has it that if the line of the king’s kite was cut, it flew to Lhasa. But since anyone who caught that kite received five rupees, everyone attempted to catch that kite.”In 2021 news report ‘Bhawanle Chhekidiyo Changa Udaune Aakash’ by Shivahari Ghimire published in Nayapatrika, cultural expert the late Satyamohan Joshi also recounts that “During Dashain, Tribhuvan came to the ground below Swayambhu to fly kites. […] He did not use the same thread to fly kites twice.”In the same article, Joshi says that the King also went to Budhanilakantha to fly kites and participate in kite flying competitions.End of season, end of cultureMohan Krishna Shrestha, 86, was born in Budhanilakantha. Every year, on the day of Haribodhini Ekadashi, he saw the annual fair at the Budhanilakantha Temple. He also witnessed kite fliers gathered in the open fields around the Temple.“Oh, it’d be a lot of people,” says Shrestha. “They came from all around Bhaktapur, Kathmandu and Lalitpur.”They flew kites on Ekadashi, Dwadashi and some even until Purnima.“They took all the remaining threads and kites that had survived Dashain and flew the last kites of the season,” says Tuladhar. “I remember my uncles, relatives and neighbours going to Budhanilakantha with their kites.”Joshi recalls in the 2021 article that King Tribhuvan also went to Budhanilakantha with his sons Mahendra, Himalaya and Basundhara. He greatly supported and also participated in the competitions there organised by the commoners. If he liked he gave prize money to the winners.This annual event lost its glory days after the decline in the open fields as buildings began to rise with the establishment of Budhanilkantha School in 1972, Mohan says.“The event survived in some form until the 1990s,” he says.But what happened after that?The end-of-the-season event in the 1990s was also an indication of the end of the age-old kite tradition.“If I go to my ancestral place in Asan to fly kites, it’s not possible for me to do that today because there are buildings everywhere,” says Tuladhar. “Cityscapes and urbanisation have created the obstacle for flying kites.”Dibya does feel like flying kites sometimes.“No space to fly kites today,” he says. “In the old times, there were river banks and open fields. Even if you fly kites, it gets stuck in somebody's rooftop or water tank or somewhere.”Yesteryear’s kite enthusiasts believe that increasing means of entertainment was another reason for the decline of kite culture.“When television came, kite flying started to slowly decrease,” says Bibek. “And then mobile phones robbed kite flying even more.”And so, when his sister Sajani cranes her neck up in the sky today, she rarely sees a kite.“Those days we heard one chait after another,” she says. “These days you won’t hear a single chait.” \nIn 2008 Matina Shakya was only three years old when she was appointed as the Kumari of Kathmandu. She was succeeded by Trishna Shakya as the new Kumari in 2017.Kumaris are revered as goddesses of beauty and strength in certain Hindu and Buddhist traditions. Worshipping young girls as Kumaris is a 2,000-year-old practice in Nepal. Since the 13th century, when the Malla kings ruled, the Newars of the Kathmandu Valley have been worshipping Kumari, a girl from the Shakya/Bajracharya community chosen to embody the divine energy of goddess Taleju Bhawani. The reign of a Kumari ends when she starts menstruating. So long as she is serving as the Kumari, she is believed to be the nation’s divine protector, safeguarding it from evil. Matina, 18, is now in her first year of college, studying for a bachelor’s degree in management. Her father, Pratapman Shakya, when asked about having a daughter who is the only living the goddess in the world said, “Not having your own daughter live in the same house as you seemed a little unfair, but we feel very proud to call ourselves the parents of the royal Kumari who is revered by people all over the world.”On March 9, 2023, he, along with Matina, were getting ready for a special function held to honour all former Kumaris from across Nepal. “There are often events to honour Matina as she was the royal Kumari, but this one was dedicated to all former Kumaris from different areas. There are 129 living Kumaris in all,” he added. Besides Kathmandu, Kumari tradition is followed in Bhaktapur, Lalitpur, and Kirtipur, among other cities.According to him, this was the first time an event like this was organised and the Deputy Mayor of Kathmandu, Sunita Dangol, was also in attendance.Throughout the year, many people line up outside the ‘Kumari Ghar’ to get a chance to visit the Kumari and get her blessings. Many foreigners stand out in the yard to catch a glimpse of her. Nepali people believe that if a Kumari smiles at you, it is a bad omen.Everyday, a tutor visits the Kumari to help her continue with her education as she is not allowed to step outside the Kumari Ghar. She takes her exams and does her homework from the Kumari Ghar itself. She also has the freedom to play inside the Kumari Ghar. Many former kumaris have pursued careers in their fields of interest or studied after their term ends, and they continue to be treated with the same respect. The tradition of Kumari has evolved over time. In the past Kumaris did not enjoy these freedoms.Because of various superstitious beliefs, Kumaris were not fully educated and were forbidden from getting married because of the belief that the groom would die soon if he married an ex-Kumari. They led secluded lives, were restricted from participating in normal childhood activities, and focused solely on their religious duties.However, now, these myths have been dispelled. Modern understanding has shifted to recognise that Kumaris, after stepping down from their divine role, have the freedom to marry and lead a normal life. The perception of Kumaris as isolated figures has evolved, with a focus on providing them with a more balanced upbringing. There have been initiatives to integrate Kumaris into regular social and educational settings, allowing them to have a more holistic and fulfilling childhood experience. “Matina was already familiar with the students from the school that she attended after her term as Kumari ended,” said Shakya. “The kids visited the Kumari Ghar frequently so that she could have a smooth transition,” he added. According to Gautam Prasad Shakya, who has been living as a caretaker in the Kumari Ghar, the changes made to the tradition are minor. “The traditions of Kumari have mostly stayed the same. All the rituals are still practised like in the old days,” he said.On 6 May 2005, Pun Devi Maharjan, a lawyer, filed a case in the Supreme Court claiming that the traditional practice of electing young girls as Kumaris, or “goddesses’, who are expected to follow certain social restrictions and appear at religious festivals, violated the rights of the child. Quoting Maharjan’s complaint, Puskar Mathema writes in Yuwamanch Monthly of October 2007, “If Kumari tradition is continued, it will undermine the fundamental rights as well the freedoms of children guaranteed by the constitution and child rights treaties. Apart from this, it will have a negative impact on their physical and mental development.”The case continued while Nepal overthrew the monarchy and declared itself a secular state in 2007. When the judgement was pronounced in 2008, the goddess was still in her role, now giving blessings to the country’s President. The court ordered that the Kumaris and ex-Kumaris receive better benefits and arrangements and ordered the government to improve their support and allowances.In April 2006, Prof Chunda Bajracharya filed a petition at the Supreme Court against Maharjan’s petition, who had argued against the Kumari tradition. Bajracharya contended that the tradition should be preserved as heritage due to its over 100 years of history.“People who don’t understand the culture shouldn’t comment on it,” she stated. Bajracharya also criticised the human right activists who contended that Kumaris were only allowed to wear the colour red. “People who say Kumaris are forced to wear red clothing all the time, are the same people who send their kids to schools in uniform,” she said.“After the 2008 court verdict, there have been a lot of improvements. Now, a teacher visits the Kumari Ghar daily to tutor the Kumari, who is expected to complete school assignments and sit periodic exams. All the former Kumaris now get benefits like scholarships and special pensions,” she added.Bajracharya is currently a professor of literature at the Tribhuvan University in Kathmandu.“The only significant change that the court verdict brought to the tradition was in terms of her education,” said Gautam Prasad Shakya, the caretaker. “Kumaris were tutored long before the case, but the case helped formalise this arrangement. After the court verdict, the time between 12 pm and 4 pm was designated as the Kumari’s tuition time,” he added.After the verdict, there was a concerted effort to provide Kumaris with access to quality education, enabling them to develop the skills and knowledge needed to lead fulfilling lives beyond their divine roles. There was also a shift towards ensuring that the Kumari's living quarters are comfortable, safe, and conducive to her overall well-being.Moreover, the selection process for the Kumari underwent reforms in the aftermath of the Pun Devi Maharjan case. There was a push for greater transparency, accountability, and inclusivity in the selection of the Kumari, with an emphasis on ensuring that the process was fair, respectful, and free from undue influence.Efforts were made to support their transition into adulthood, including providing them with comprehensive resources for education, vocation, and social integration. This shift aimed to address the challenges faced by former Kumaris and empower them to lead independent and fulfilling lives after their divine service.“The Kumari tradition has evolved over time. During the tenure of my daughter, we saw a lot of improvements. Even after her time as Kumari, Matina continued to get a lot of government support,” said Shakya, former Kumari Matina’s father.“Some people argue that child rights are being violated, but all of her rights are being upheld inside the Kumari Ghar. This is a unique and respected aspect of Nepali culture, and I don’t believe it violates any of my child’s rights.”While the Kumari tradition continues, its practices have evolved. “She enjoys this normal life and it didn’t take her long to adjust as well,” says Matina’s father, on her transition from the revered Kumari to the ordinary Matina. \nWhat animals did Juddha Shumsher have in his zoo?“We only have records of animals from the mid-1960s,” says Ganesh Koirala, who has been employed at the Central Zoo for the past 36 years and currently serves as its information officer and programme officer. “That too I hand-copied from an old torn-down file that I came across.”Today, the Central Zoo, which sprawls across six hectares in Jawalakhel, Lalitpur, houses as many as 1,298 wild animals of different species of mammals, reptiles, fishes and birds from Nepal and around the world—from tiger, rhinoceros, hippopotamus and red panda to its recent attraction: a pair of chimpanzees.After enduring decades of neglect under various government bodies, with its animals and infrastructure scraping along in a deplorable state, the zoo received a new lease of life with improved infrastructure and animal care in 1995, when it came under the management of the King Mahendra Trust for Nature Conservation (KMTNC), now known as the National Trust for Nature Conservation, in 1995.Today, the Central Zoo is an entertainment venue, one of the most happening places in the Kathmandu valley. Flocked by thousands of daily visitors, the zoo now also hosts rescued animals and those in need of rehabilitation. It is also a site for conservation education.But when Juddha Shumsher Rana (prime minister from 1932–1945) built the Jawalakhel Zoological Garden on the premises of his Jawalakhel Durbar (where Nepal Administrative Staff College stands today) in 1932, he did so purely for private interests—as a space of entertainment and amusement for him and his family.Built in the semi-wilderness of Jawalakhel around a historical pond dating to the 17th century during the reign of King Siddhi Narsingh Malla, the zoo also became the space he could use to show his respect for two women he revered, his mother and sister-in-law, and indulge in one of his favourite pastimes—gambling.Today, the Central Zoo, nestled in the heart of Jawalakhel's sprawling crowd, does not go unnoticed, and its story is well told. But what passions drove Juddha to build the zoo? What was its original layout? What animals did it have in the beginning? And how did Juddha spend time there?“I remember once seeing a small board that read ‘Jawalakhel Zoological Garden’,” Koirala says. “I don’t know whether it was from Juddha’s time or was made in the later years. It must surely be that Juddha built the zoo out of influence from the British given how this term was used by them.”Koirala adds, “There is a former employee, now an elderly gentleman who worked in the zoo in the 1960s. He surely has some stories from Juddha’s time.”Birds, beasts and palacesTo trace the birth of Jawalakhel Zoological Garden, one has to look at the history of Nepal’s rulers owning birds and animals.Like rulers around the world, Nepal’s royalty kept wild and exotic birds and animals in captivity as a source of pleasure and mark of wealth and power. The book ‘Social History of Nepal’ by historians TR Vaidya, Tri Ratna Manandhar and Shankar Lal Joshi details how Mallas during the mediaeval Kathmandu Valley to Ranas and Shahs in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries owned rare, exotic creatures. In 1708, a rhinoceros in Kathmandu Valley broke the iron chain in which it was bound and killed its tamer. In 1714, Bhaktapur’s King Bhupatindra Malla gifted a camel and an elephant to Kantipur’s King Bhaskar Malla to build peace.Among Shahs, King Rana Bahadur Shah in particular was reputed for his collection of birds and animals. He also owned a zoo outside his palace in Basantapur Durbar Square, where the Nepal Bank Limited stands in New Road today. The zoo contained “tiger, bear, monkey, elephant, horse, deer… heron, peacock… pigeon, wild dogs, rabbits, rats, mongoose.”Jung Bahadur Rana’s zoo on the premises of his Thapathali Durbar hosted a variety of birds and animals collected during his hunting expeditions as well as those brought from abroad. Jung Bahadur himself used to “supervise and inspect it”. Juddha Shumsher likewise had his own collection of creatures which steadily expanded into a zoological garden. Seeking wilderness in his Jawalakhel DurbarJuddha’s biographer Ishwari Prasad writes in ‘The Life and Times of Maharaja Juddha Shumsher Jung Bahadur Rana’ that between 1933 and 1940, Juddha shot 433 tigers, 33 rhinoceros and 93 leopards. An insatiable big-game hunter, Juddha had a deep fondness for being in the wild and among wild animals, and from this came, according to oral history prevalent among members of Kathmandu’s Rana community including Juddha’s descendants, the desire to own a zoo.Built in 1752, Schönbrunn Zoo in Vienna, the world’s first modern zoo, was already over 100 years old when Juddha was born in 1875. London Zoo opened in 1828 and Alipore Zoological Garden (Kolkata Zoo) in 1875. Nawab Wajid Ali Shah Zoological Garden (Lucknow Zoo) was established in 1921. Juddha’s inspiration, his descendants say, was most likely reinforced by his tours to zoological gardens during his visits to England in 1908 and to different Indian cities.An article titled ‘Central zoo in state of neglect’ published in The Kathmandu Post in 1996 says that Juddha one day “received a pair of leopards as a gift”, cementing his desire to own a zoo. A report ‘Central Zoo Master Plan’ prepared by the KMTNC in 1996 says that Juddha decided to build a zoo in an epiphany when he saw that some animals “including deer, a few rhinos, and some tigers had been collected from the Tarai and kept in Kathmandu” could be put into one compound in the “lonely piece of land with a large 16th [sic] century Malla period Pokhari”.The pond lay still and serene surrounded by green wilderness ever since Patan’s King Siddhi Narsingh Malla built it in the 1600s. On the grounds surrounding this pond, the Newars from Na:Tole, Pulchowk and surroundings had their devisthans where, for centuries, they gathered to perform their religious ceremonies during Basanta Panchami and Bhoto Jatra even after this area fell within the Jawalakhel Durbar.For the palace, the ground served as its extended garden along with a horse and elephant stable. Subodh Rana, 69, grandson of Juddha Shumsher, recalled his father Kiran Shumsher telling him that Juddha and his family sometimes also used the scenic grounds for picnics. If there was any spot where Juddha wanted to build a menagerie, it would be around this Pokhari (pond). One day, he called his grandson General Maheshwar Shumsher Rana and deputed him to the task of doing just this.The zoo’s layout—except for the small plots of lands acquired later—that was in place when it came under KMTNC's management was, the present and retired zoo officials believe, mostly the same as it was built by Maheshwar and so offers a peek into how Juddha’s zoo must have been like. Pond in the middle of the ground surrounded by enclosures—the southern bank housing mainly larger animals, and cages for birds positioned on the northern banks.From pigeons to the king of the jungleWhat animals and birds did the enclosures at Juddha’s zoo house?“We cannot tell for sure,” Koirala says.Once it came under government ownership, the zoo was tossed from one institution to the other for lack of interest and knowledge on the right institution to manage it. Amid all this chaos, documents were possibly lost and the zoo has no concrete record about the animals that Juddha must have once taken amusement at, said Koirala.Mukti Narayan Shrestha, 82, a retired secretary of the Nepal government, joined the Central Zoo in 1970 as a veterinarian when many original structures of the zoo were still intact. Shrestha also worked with an elderly khardar who, he says, was employed in the zoo since the time of Juddha and was about to retire when he joined.“In those days where the purpose of menageries was exclusively for exhibition and pleasure with no regard for the welfare and recreation of animals and birds, the cages were tiny and iron-barred,” Shrestha says.Elephant, horses, deer, monkeys, tiger, rhinoceros, clouded leopard, red panda, bear, palm civet (nir biralo), four-horned antelope, Himalayan goral, pheasants, Himalayan monal—from the mythical and the majestic, the gentle and friendly to the fiery and ferocious, Juddha’s zoo boasted them all, Shrestha says.Shrestha’s account is not different from the anecdotes passed down to other retired and present zoo officials and the members of the Rana community, who also detail the rare and the exotic fauna, like the gharial crocodile and porcupine, even the jungle’s king—creatures, they say, that Juddha must have received from foreigners as gifts—appearing alongside domestic birds like pigeons.Tidbits of published information also confirm that the zoo had a good collection of exotic birds and animals from Nepal and abroad. One such suggestion comes from Kalyan Shumsher’s ‘Shree Teen Juddha Mahima’ published during Juddha’s reign in 1943.“One need not travel abroad to see the incredible birds and animals found in foreign countries,” he writes. “It will suffice to see [those creatures] right here in the zoo opened by His Holiness Shree 3 [Juddha] in Jawalakhel.”Among these incredible creatures, one reigned supreme—lion, the king of the jungle.For one, it would not have satiated Juddha to build a zoo and not have the jungle’s king exhibited in it. Juddha hence must have done everything possible to ensure one for the zoo. Infrastructure at the zoo suggests that the lion indeed lived at Juddha’s zoo or, in the least, during the Rana regime.“Where bear habitat lies today, there were two dome-shaped attached enclosures with a holding room, constructed in the classic architecture that many enclosures in the British zoos had in the past. They had brick walls and lime plaster,” Koirala says. “These were built to house a lion in one cage and a tiger in the other.”Near these enclosures stood another cage that remains intact today, with the head of a roaring lion carved out of the wall on the top of its iron bars. Zoo officials as well as members of the Rana community believe that Juddha had this exhibit built to specifically house a lion.Remarkably, these Juddha-era infrastructural spaces are corroborated by a rare piece of photographic evidence. A 1946 photo of the zoo shows a lion while a Kathmandu mother and her sons stand in front of its cage.Juddha’s place of piety and playThe zoo was not merely a space that Juddha sought out for amusement and retreat in the outpost of his palace; he also used this place to express his deepest affection.This affection spills right at the zoo’s entrance, in the form of the life-size statue of Karma Kumari Devi, wife of Juddha’s elder brother and Rana Prime Minister Dev Shumsher. Karma Kumari stands tall in her regal costume shaded by a wide canopy. Juddha revered Karma Kumari because it was she who raised him and looked after his mother Juhar Kumari Devi after the death of his father Dhir Shumsher. On another prominent part of the zoo on the south-east, Juhar Kumari’s enthroned statue overlooks the pond. Juddha had commissioned the London-based sculptor Domenico Antonio Tonelli to cast these statues.When Karma Kumari’s statue was unveiled is not clear, but Juhar Kumari’s statue was unveiled by Juddha amid a grand function in 1935 on Jawalakhel’s most auspicious day, Bhoto Jatra. It was attended by the British Resident Frederick Bailey.“On June 28, 1935, at Jawalakhel Durbar… the pond nearby looked very scenic,” says a Gorkhapatra news report titled ‘Statue installation’ dated July 5, 1935. “Because it was the day of Bhoto Jatra of Machhindranath… and moreover since an ideal woman’s statue was being unveiled, there was a crowd of lakhs of people.”Less than fifty metres from Karma Kumari’s statue stands a one-story building with a pagoda roof that today serves as the zoo’s meeting hall. Juddha, an avid gambler, found the scenic semi-wilderness covered in trees and filled with the sounds of wildlife to be a perfect place to relish the game. So he built a building with twelve doors on its four sides allowing him and his fellow gambling compatriots the freedom to enter through a particular door that they thought would bring luck. He called it his Juwa Ghar, the gambling house, and built it with the sole purpose of indulging in the game he loved. Roar of lion reverberates in KathmanduThe sounds of the animals and birds in the zoo rose up in the Jawalakhel sky. Every day, until much later in the 1970s, roar of the zoo’s lion (there were later other lions) diffused to far corners of the Valley, merging the zoo with the spirit of Kathmandu and informing the city folks of its presence.But was the zoo open to the public as well?“I think once it was built, the zoo was open for the public,” Subodh Rana said. “It is unlikely that Juddha Shumsher built such a large zoo and kept it only for his family.”For one, Kalyan Shumsher mentioning that one “need not travel abroad to see the incredible birds and animals found in foreign countries” suggests that the public had at least some access to the zoo. Of course, the Newar community from Na:Tole, Pulchowk and surrounding areas were permitted inside the zoo on the days of their guthi functions on Basanta Panchami and Bhoto Jatra.As the zoo was established at the back of the ground where Bhoto Jatra celebrations happen, it naturally filled with revellers on this day in addition to the guthi ritual observers as testified by the Gorkhapatra report. The photo of the mother and her sons also bear testimony that the zoo was not entirely closed to the public.What is widely believed, though, is that the zoo officially came under government ownership after Nepal became a democracy in 1951. And it would still be a few more years before it was open to the public in 1956.In 1945, Juddha gave up his power and eventually retired in Dehradun, India, where he died in 1952. With time, Jawalakhel Zoological Garden became the Central Zoo. It would take many avatars—a neglected site of crammed, unmaintained cages with sad eyes of emaciated creatures staring from behind the bars, a focal point of animal diplomacy, particularly during the period of monarchy, to, in its recent decades, a space of conservation and education.When all this was happening, the city sprawled around Jawalakhel, subduing the lion’s roar with its noise. More wildlife from around the country and the world came—creatures captured from the wild, those sold by circuses, those rescued from traffickers. Fate would bring these creatures to the care of generations of Kathmandu folks, intertwining each other’s joys and sorrows. After the tale of Juddha’s Jawalakhel Zoological Garden, there would be these stories to tell. Sitting around a table inside Juddha’s Juwa Ghar, Koirala and other zoo officials begin unfolding these stories before me. \nNepal’s book market is no stranger to the popular Bangladeshi-Swedish writer Taslima Nasrin. Almost all of her books have been translated into Nepali, but Nasrin herself says that they are all unauthorised translations. “All books [Nepali translations] are pirated versions,” Nasrin told the Post in a Whatsapp conversation. Nasrin, who is currently in exile in India after facing death threats in Bangladesh following the publication of her novel Lajja (Shame), said that she or her publishers have never allowed anyone the right to translate her books into Nepali. “I don’t know of any such Nepali publishers. No one asked for permission and no one has paid [me] royalty.”Translating and publishing books without permission from authors or publishers is a punishable crime. But Nepal’s book market is full of such unauthorised translations and prints of books written by the who’s who of the world literature. Such endeavours haven’t just hurt the authors but also the readers, says Ajit Baral, publisher of the Kathmandu-based Fineprint publication. “These translations are poor,” Baral says. “Tomes with 1200–1300 pages have been trimmed to 200–300 pages. An example is the biography of Bill Clinton.”Another popular book that has seen unauthorised Nepali translation is the biography of Steve Jobs by Walter Isaacson.“We have no official deal in place for a [Nepali] translation of Steve Jobs,” Peppa Mignone, associate agent of the CAA, the translation authority of the biography, said in an email interview with the Post.The book’s Nepali translation is published by Panchpokhari Publication House. The translated book identifies the translator thus: “Achyut Koirala, who has a master’s in English literature, is primarily a journalist. He is currently affiliated with Nagarik daily. He keeps a close tab on international history, politics and culture and has written scripts and dialogues for half a dozen Nepali films. He has published over a dozen non-fiction books.”Koirala, who admits to the unauthorised translation, claims that he hasn’t just translated the book but has also done ‘creative writing’ with it.‘Rich Dad Poor Dad’, written by Robert Kiyosaki and Sharon Lechter, is among the books that’s perennially on the bestseller list across the world. Upon investigation, the Post found three Nepali translations of the book—all unauthorised. One of them is translated by Dilip Kumar Shrestha and published by the same firm, the Panchpokhari Publication House. Another Nepali iteration of the book is published by Book For All publication and translated by Kopila MD. Yet another Nepali version is translated by one Sudheer Dixit and published by Plata Publication, Kathmandu.In an email conversation with the Post, Ronson Taylor, who oversees the international rights at The Rich Dad Company, said, “At this point in time, we do not have a relationship with an established publisher in the [Nepali] language market. If there are any Rich Dad Poor Dad books currently for sale in the Nepali market, they are pirated.”Basanta Thapa, a writer and translator, says that many books are being translated of late to make easy money. “But how would the quality of these unauthorised translations be!” Thapa wonders. “Readers who haven’t read the original wouldn’t know the faults in the translated versions.” Thapa says that any translator worth his salt aims to ‘recreate’ a book and it takes much work to do that.Taslima’s books are the major victimsTaslima’s memoir Uttal Hawa has been translated into Nepali as ‘Sangharsha’, literally Struggle, and is published by Khoji Publication House. Even though the book in its cover claims that it is an authorised translation from the English version Wild Wind, it is a pirated one. The book is translated by Bikash Basnet and edited by Bhogiraj Chamling. A revised version of the book is edited by Sangeet Srota (Yam Bahadur Chhetri).The same publication house has also published the Nepali translation of the book’s sequel as ‘Prem ra Jeevan’. Publisher Sushil Chalise says that while he is aware that one needs to receive permission from the author or the publisher to translate a book, his efforts to contact Taslima were unsuccessful. Therefore, he had published the version the translator made available to him. Translator Basnet, too, admits he translated the book without Taslima’s permission. “About a decade back, we didn’t know how to ask for permission,” he said.Nepal has the Copyright Act (2002) in place. Before it, there was the The Patent, Design and Trade Mark Act, 2022 (1965) that included intellectual property in its 2006 revision. Even the Muluki Ain (Civil Code) of 1910 BS had a provision about copyright. Moreover, it goes without saying that translating somebody else’s work without permission is immoral.Likewise, Indigo Ink Pvt Ltd has published a Nepali translation of Taslima’s anthology of essays No Country for Women as ‘Aaimai ko Kunai Desh Chhaina’. The book is translated by Krishna Giri and edited by Pramod Pradhan. “I have no idea about the agreement between the publisher and translator,” Pradhan, who is also a children’s book writer, says. “I just copy-edited it upon request.”Bishnukumar Poudel, publisher of Indigo Ink, however, claims that he is still trying to take translation rights for the book. “We translated the book long ago,” he says. “We are still trying to get translation rights.”Indigo is also publishing unauthorised translations under its imprints All Book Store Pvt Ltd, Book for All and Plata Publication. It has published two versions of Rich Dad Poor Dad under those shadow imprints. But Plata Publication is not registered in the Company Registrar’s Office.Pradhan says that many foreign books have had unauthorised translations in Nepali and their quality is poor. Those books are translated not from the original language but from a second or third language, so these translations are bound to have problems, he says. “After I learned that those were unauthorised translations, I have stopped editing them,” Pradhan said.Indian author Shiv Khera’s You Can Win has been translated into Nepali by Bloomsbury India and has granted the distribution rights to Ekta Books. But the book’s unauthorised translations are also found in the market and they don’t even mention the name of the publisher and translator. What is interesting is they mention that it’d be illegal to republish the book, or an excerpt of it, without the author’s permission.The Nepali translation of the book, which was poorly written and rife with inaccuracies, had landed the publisher at court. After a complaint was filed at the District Court Kathmandu in 2066BS on the charge that the publisher violated the copyrights and economic rights, the court had issued a verdict on Mangsir 11 that year, charging a fine of Rs10,000, Rs20,000 and Rs30,000 to the defendants Netra Prasad Pokharel, Narayan Prasad Bhusal, and Bhagwati Risal and Bishnu Silwal, respectively.Baral, the Fineprint publisher, says that international publishers wouldn’t demand much for translation rights given Nepal’s small market, but Nepali publishers do not bother to reach out to them. “Publishers who put out unauthorised translations and sell them at 50 percent discount have troubled publishers like us,” he said.Fineprint has published authorised translated versions of books such as Leaving Microsoft to Change the World by John Wood, Healed by Manisha Koirala, and Hippie by Paulo Coelho. The publication house is also set to release the Nepali translation of Israeli historian Yuval Noah Harari’s bestseller Sapiens. Translated into Nepali by Dinesh Kafle, the book’s translation right was acquired at the cost of USD1300, Baral said. Likewise, the publication acquired the translation rights of Sadhguru’s Inner Engineering at IRS93,000, he added.Baral says that publication of unauthorised translations is an immoral and illegal work. “This phenomenon not just hampers Nepal’s fledgling book publishing industry but also tarnishes the country’s reputation in the global market,” Baral said.Thapa, the writer and translator, points out the lack of regulatory mechanisms in the country. “We don’t have an agency that regulates the quality of translations being done,” he says. “Nobody compares the translation with the original. We need a dedicated authority to enhance the quality of translation.” Universities, Nepal Academy and other stakeholders can play a role to uplift the translation sector, he adds.One’s pain, another’s pleasureWhen the author Suketu Mehta was travelling through Mumbai, a young man approached him with a handful of books while his vehicle was stuck in traffic. Brandishing Maximum City, written by none other than Mehta himself, the young man requested the author to buy a copy. Suketu leafed through the book and said, “This is a pirated copy and I’m the author of this book.” The youth wasn’t bothered and replied, “Okay, you can buy it at a discount.”This anecdote was shared to the Post by Mehta’s friend, the author and professor Amitava Kumar, in an email exchange.Most of these pirated books are imported into Nepal from India while the retailers of original books are finding themselves increasingly in trouble. “We sell original copies but many readers doubt us as well, given the ubiquity of pirated versions,” says Anjan Shrestha, operator of Education Book House, Jamal.Ramchandra Timothy, chair of Thapathali-based Ekta Books Pvt Ltd, said that the phenomenon of piracy has tarnished Nepal’s image internationally. “There was a time when Bangladesh would be known as ‘piracy king’,” he said. “Now there's a risk Nepal would take the crown.”As tax increases, so does piracyThe government decision to impose a 10 percent tax on book imports in fiscal year 2019-20 led to a proliferation of pirated book markets, booksellers say. After the decision, booksellers started to cut back on imports and that led to the entry of a new crop of pirated booksellers, a trader in Kathmandu says. But following widespread backlash, then finance minister Bishnu Paudel struck down the policy.“After the government’s decision, we stopped importing books for a while,” says Shrestha of Education Books. “The import of books went down for about two years. Then the pirates stepped in to fill the gap. It was about that time that pirated copies of biographies and memoirs of Obamas and Jai Shettys became omnipresent in the market.”Pirated copies of classics by Roald Dahl and JK Rowling also made an entry in the Nepali market. Then the phenomenon only saw a rise.Since the customs department does not levy duty on foreign books and also does not care to differentiate between the pirated and original copies, unauthorised books have found a safe haven in Nepali market.The government doesn’t levy any customs duty on books and newspapers published by foreign publishers abroad. The importers should only pay Rs565 at the customs points. But Nepali publishers have to pay 10 percent tax to import books printed in India.James Taylor, director of Communications and Freedom to Publish of the International Publishers Association, says that the government, publishers, writers and readers should join hands to control widespread piracy. “The government should realise that book publishing and reading culture contribute to the country’s economy as well,” he said, adding that the government should seize pirated books and close websites that sell pirated ebooks.Nandan Jha, executive vice chair of Penguin Random House India’s sales, production and business department, says that piracy has emerged as a big challenge for publishers of late and has harmed the authors, publishers, distributors, printers, readers and other stakeholders. “To confront piracy, all the stakeholders should launch a special joint effort,” Jha told the Post in an email exchange.Piracy has proliferated in the Nepali market to such an extent that the publishers of such books and unauthorised translations keep whatever ISBN numbers they like, often conflicting with other books, and still get off scot free. If scanned or searched on the internet, the ISBN number gives details on the author of the book, what the book is about, and its price, among others.Bijay Sharma, information officer at TU Library, says, “Keeping ISBN number at one’s will is illegal. If anyone files a complaint, we can punish them.”By the lawThe Muluki Ain-1910 BS had mandated that a publisher take permission of Gorkha Bhasa Prakashini Samiti before publishing any material. The Copyrights Act came into effect in 2022 BS and was amended in 2054 BS. In 2059 BS, a new Act was promulgated and it is still effective now. Authorities are currently working to amend the Act to give the registrar’s office more autonomy regarding copyright.According to the 2059 BS Act, copyright violations are considered government cases. In such cases, plaintiffs should file a complaint with the police. The Act’s clause 25 has various conditions that amount to violation of copyright. The Act’s subclause A says that if a publisher produces or copies material in writing or sound and sells or distributes it, it amounts to violation of copyright.Likewise, the Act’s clause 26 prevents selling of unauthorised material. The clause restricts the ‘importation of copies of work or sound recording, either made in a foreign country or sourced otherwise, into Nepal for business purpose shall not be permitted if preparation of such copies would be considered illegal if they were prepared in Nepal.’If anyone infringes upon protected rights, they are liable to punishment but the provision’s implementation remains lax.The law gives the authority to district court to take legal action against copyright violators.Advocate Parshuram Koirala says that if the government becomes more proactive, it can punish violators on the basis of the 2059 BS Act and thereby control the phenomenon of intellectual theft and copyright violations. “Creation is a crucial part of humanity’s benefit,” he says. “If intellectual property is not protected effectively, then there’d be no inspiration to create something.”Bal Bahadur Mukhiya, a professor at Nepal Law Campus, suggests the inclusion of rules about digital piracy in law, and also the clauses of various related international treaties and agreements that Nepal is part of.“In the US, a teacher or professor should pay a certain revenue even to photocopy a chapter of some text for teaching purposes,” Mukhiya says. “But in Nepal, those who photocopy an entire book and sell it go scot free.”(This report is prepared in collaboration with the Centre for Investigative Journalism, Nepal.) \nThe pre-1990 generation would remember quite well what the government press considered newsworthy back then. At a time when the private electronic media was non-existent, the entire nation was forced to hear or watch the ritualistic recounting of every action of members of the royal family, starting, of course, with the head honcho himself. Thus, after invariably informing us about the king’s having felicitated or condoled, as the case may be, the president of a country we would have had no prior dealings or any since, we would be expected to be enthused by the news that another such country had supported the king’s still-born ‘zone of peace’ proposal. Next would come the scintillating development that the queen had visited a temple while a princess received a consignment of donated medicines and another attended a diplomatic party. Only after having enlightened us about the everyday royal doings would we learn about floods having swept away scores in the Tarai or a diarrhoeal outbreak having struck down whole villages in the west. It was no better in print except that, given the format, one could find the real news on the front page, albeit buried somewhere in the blaze of royal doings, with the only giveaway being the headline in bold italics.One could hence be pardoned for the sense of déjà vu in the run-up to Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli’s US visit to attend the UN General Assembly this past month. Publication after publication (and I’m sure that was the case with the radio and TV outlets) went on about each and every detail of how the prime minister was going to keep himself busy in New York. Perhaps because nothing substantial was likely to be achieved in New York, read, a meeting with the Indian prime minister, Oli’s office tried to highlight every aspect of his upcoming trip.That Oli would face an almost-empty auditorium at the UN was only to be expected since leaders from countries like ours speak only for the record and not to actually influence global policy one way or another. Fortunately for Oli, a meeting with Narendra Modi did materialise eventually, and he was also able to catch up with a few others who had most likely been fishing around for tête-à-têtes as well.What stood out was that the pre-visit reporting made it sound like the primary purpose of Oli’s trip half-way around the world was to speak at Columbia and Harvard universities, and his attending the annual UN jamboree was only incidental. In fact, one newspaper actually headlined the university visits in this manner, “Prime Minister Oli will address Columbia and Harvard universities”, and, began the story with: “Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli, who is coming to America to participate in the 79th General Assembly of the United Nations (UN), will address Columbia University in New York and Harvard University in Boston.”The breathless tone suggests that if not the governing boards, at least the presidents of these universities had cogitated long and hard on who should be invited to speak at their university this year. And, as it so happened, both elite institutions homed in on no other than our prime minister and accordingly invited him to grace the university premises. Enticing as that scenario might sound to those of a nationalist bent, that would be quite far from the truth. Events at such universities as in any other, and there are always countless such at any given time, are generally initiated by a student body, a member of the faculty or a group of students or even just one, and also at times in response to feelers sent out by diplomatic missions in the case of foreign leaders.At Columbia, Oli was invited to speak at the World Leaders Forum. This is a series that appears to come alive mostly around the time of the UN General Assembly, taking advantage of Columbia’s location in the same city with leaders like Oli more than happy to oblige. The Harvard talk was part of the JFK Jr Forum, but being placed far away from New York, the emphasis appears less on world leaders. The day before had seen a group discussion on ‘Building a Digital Democracy’ while the one with the Ecuadorian president had been cancelled. The day following the Oli do was just a watch party to talk about the American vice-presidential debate. And that was just the JFK Jr Forum; on the day of Oli’s interaction, 38 other events were taking place at Harvard.I will not join many others in criticising Oli’s performance. I should say he did creditably well while reading from the teleprompter or the printed page although neither of his deliveries contained anything newsworthy. It was his nonanswers and the senseless or fudged ones during the Q&A that had people riled up, but by now, they should have known better than to expect anything but wisecracks from Oli in lieu of reasoned thought. That he had to deliver his homilies in English was a problem, but he made himself understood. I suppose the only revelation was that Oli’s interlocutor at Columbia, Jenik Radon, an Adjunct Professor there, was a ‘key drafter’ of the 2007 Interim Constitution, a fact that would surely come as news to the 16 members of the Constitution Drafting Committee.What bugs me is how Oli was both visibly humbled and honoured to speak at Columbia and Harvard. There is no need to belabour the hypocrisy of someone moved to such emotions is the same one who has done and would do practically nothing to improve the quality of Nepal’s institutions of learning. Former education minister Sumana Shrestha pointed out the irony of Oli speaking at the two universities when he himself was ‘a staunch advocate to get students, professors, teachers, university administration including [the] bureaucracy to take political party membership. Nepal’s higher education has been defunct due to partisan politics’.The greater irony is that the same Oli, who goes around bashing everything and everyone he does not like as inspired by foreign sources, could not but try and seek legitimacy for himself and his ‘theories’ at the very fount of knowledge where many ideas antithetical to his worldview are generated. What else can explain the constant harping about what were touted to be Oli’s supposedly masterly expositions at Columbia and Harvard? That, I believe, is the greater tragedy. But only if Oli and those who think like him would be willing to concede as much.  \nWhile artificial intelligence (AI) promises immense benefits, it also imposes tremendous risks. Some of them—accelerating misinformation, sophisticated cyber attacks, and soaring energy consumption—have already arrived. Others, including super-intelligent machines that take decisions independently of human oversight, are likely still a few years away. Although awareness about these risks is growing, many others have yet to be defined. And for all the incalculable opportunities afforded by AI, especially in developing countries, it is risky business.Concerns are mounting about the ways in which the rapid adoption of AI will negatively impact societies, including in the Global South. Last year my Institute together with New America convened a Global Task Force made up of AI specialists from across the Americas, Africa, and Asia to review ways to improve AI safety and alignment. And in 2024, the task force issued a primer to practically mitigate risks and improve resilience while also closing governance and regulatory gaps between the Global North and South.AI risksOne of the most significant risks the group identified is mass automation and job displacement. AI is expected to impact vast numbers of workers across sectors ranging from agriculture, manufacturing, retail to the law, medicine, finance. While new forms of employment will undoubtedly emerge, the jobs of up to 800 million people are at risk of automation by 2030, including 300 million in wealthy countries. The International Labor Organization estimates that over 56 percent of all jobs in low- and middle-income countries are at “high risk” of automation. Without safeguards in place, this could sharpen economic inequality and exclude low-skilled workers.Another risk involves deepening digital divides and sharpening inequality. The gap between those who can access advanced technologies and those who cannot is expected to widen over the coming years, leading to lower productivity, reduced economic growth, and greater social and economic inequality. This is particularly so in lower and middle-income settings already facing shortfalls in digital talent and related services.Biases and discrimination are another risk associated with AI. Advanced technologies and models designed in the US, China, and EU can perpetuate and amplify biases already present in the training data. This can lead to discriminatory outcomes in everything from credit scores to policing. It can also result in unfair exclusion from opportunities in the job market, credit and loans, and health services due to biassed algorithms.The intensification of surveillance and privacy violations are also enabled by AI. The integration of AI into everything from smart cities to law enforcement can infringe on privacy, civil liberties, and human rights. This is especially so in countries with weaker democratic institutions. Indeed, authoritarian regimes are already deploying AI-enabled systems to track political opponents, suppress dissent, and target marginalised communities based on ethnic, religious, or ideological grounds.What is more, the reliance of foreign technologies and expertise also constitutes a risk in the Global South. The over-dependence on US, Chinese and European innovations can potentially reduce the incentives to build domestic tech sectors in lower-income settings. It can also degrade the bargaining power of local governments, contributing to higher costs for technology while reducing control over standards. Dependence on foreign suppliers can also result in data being more easily accessed, controlled, manipulated and exploited by foreign actors, raising concerns about privacy, property theft, and integrity of critical infrastructure.Emerging solutionsGiven all these risks, what are some of the solutions being considered in the Global South? For one, there is a growing chorus for more involvement of developing country governments and experts in the formulation of global standards. This is a call echoed in a recent 2024 UN General Assembly resolution on AI inclusion and a recently agreed Digital Compact intended to overcome digital, data and innovation divides. A consensus is emerging to ensure that AI is more equitable, inclusive, and sensitive to the specific challenges of the Global South.Practically, more investment in education and vocational training is essential to prepare for coming automation and job losses. This requires developing training centres and online courses, retraining grants, job placement services, and progressive unemployment benefits as well as universal basic income (UBI) schemes. And promising examples are emerging: India’s AI for All initiative, Rwanda’s digital ambassadors, and Brazil’s Conecta program are all helping people and companies transition to the digital economy. And countries as varied as Kenya, Namibia and India are piloting UBI, though more action is needed.Public and private actors will need to dramatically scale investment in digital infrastructure to redress digital divides across the Global South. This includes expanding internet access and broadband access to the 2.6 billion people who are still not connected. Policies that promote digital hubs, equitable access to digital services and lost-cost technology programs are essential. One example of how to amplify such activities is Smart Africa Alliance’s AI for Development (AI4D) program which is building ethical AI frameworks for governance, agriculture and healthcare.Bias and discrimination can be minimised through improved guidance and standards for AI development and deployment. Countries, companies, and digital activists need to craft and enforce regulatory frameworks that mandate algorithmic transparency and regular audits. There are also major opportunities to mandate that data used to train AI systems is more diverse and representative. The Global Task Force identified close to 700 such strategies, albeit over two thirds formulated in wealthy countries suggesting that more work needs to be done to close the gap.Curbing surveillance and privacy violations requires robust data protection and privacy laws to safeguard personal information. The European Union and countries like Brazil, India, Kenya, South Africa, and Tanzania, are developing agile regulatory frameworks tailored to their specific realities. There also needs to be clear regulation governing the use of AI for surveillance to minimise invasive practices as well as public awareness campaigns together with advocacy from civil society for stronger protections.And reducing over-dependence on foreign technology providers requires investment in local AI policy and research, alongside grants and incentives for local accelerators, start-ups and labs. International partnerships and collaboration also play a key role, such as programs to skill-up law makers and civil servants led by ITU, UNESCO, UNDP- as do dedicated centres for workforce training and education provided by groups such as Google, Intel, and Microsoft.Measures to reduce AI risks must address the gaping AI governance divide between the Global North and South. This gap is expressed not just in terms of data scientists and data centres, but also in terms of regulation. A key priority involves stepping-up the participation of Global South decision-makers and experts in AI policy development, including in the G20 and OECDcontexts. Notwithstanding legitimate concerns with regulatory fragmentation, AI governance frameworks also need to be aligned with local contexts. The recently agreed AI Strategy and Digital Transformation Strategy established by the African Union offers promising signposts.The good news is that a recent UN Resolution on Inclusive AI, High-Level Panel on AI, and Global Digital Compact are charting a positive path forward. The compact calls explicitly for more inclusive AI policy development, the standing-up of an independent scientific panel on AI, and a global dialogue to anchor AI in human rights. Perhaps most important, it also recommends the launch of a global fund to support digital infrastructure and skills development. Such a fund will need to make big bets (similar to those set out in private-led initiatives such as the recent fund launched by IBM and Blackrock if it is to help close the AI governance and capabilities gap.—The ConversationRead the original article here. \nThe academic community in Nepal has been buzzing with discussions about research and publishing for quite some time now. This trend is noticeable, especially with the rise of academic institutions—business schools in particular—that have established research centres to support both faculty and students. Many of these institutions highlight their research endeavours on their websites. Furthermore, independent research and consulting organisations that claim to undertake high-quality research have proliferated in the country. Upon reviewing their reports, it becomes apparent that many are simply collections of facts, lacking in-depth analysis and scientific rigour. These documents appear more like consulting assignments aimed at meeting client demands quickly rather than fostering genuine knowledge creation. Although they may superficially resemble research, they do not possess the rigorous standards characterising true scientific inquiry.Disconnect between academia and industryAs a coordinator of the academia-industry interface at a business school, I frequently interact with clients who approach us with research requests. Many of these domestic and international clients demonstrate a surprising lack of understanding of the research process. For example, I once had a conversation with a representative from an international organisation who wanted us to conduct a national-level study involving a mixed-method research design—within two or three months. This unrealistic expectation reflects a broader misconception among many clients that research is quick and inexpensive work when it is a complex, time-consuming process that requires significant resources.The misunderstanding extends to domestic clients as well. Often, they request research work at the last minute, either because they have leftover funds to spend or because they need documentation for their ongoing projects. These clients fail to realise that research is about \"searching again\"—a meticulous process of exploration and discovery aimed at generating new knowledge or enhancing existing theories. It cannot be rushed. Professionals often view research as gathering information without appreciating the systematic methods and discipline necessary for conducting scientific investigations.State of scientific research The government's investment in research is alarmingly low. Nepal spends approximately 0.03 percent of its GDP on research and development, with only 0.011 percent of the education sector's budget allocated to innovation. This figure is minuscule compared to what is required to foster a vibrant research culture. In the most recent budget, Rs197.29 billion was allocated to the Ministry of Education, Science, and Technology (MoEST), which included a plan to establish a fund dedicated to research and innovation of Rs1 billion. Considering Rs1 billion, it effectively comes to 0.01 percent of GDP for research alone. The government also aimed to promote research and capacity development in institutions affiliated with Tribhuvan University, such as Centre for Economic Development and Administration (CEDA), Research Centre for Educational Innovation and Development (CERID), and Centre for Nepal and Asian Studies (CNAS). However, despite these announcements, only a few initiatives have come to fruition.There are many reasons for the lack of research output. First, for many academics, research is simply a requirement for promotion. Faculty members are often burdened with administrative responsibilities, leaving little time for meaningful research. This issue is not unique to Nepal but is a global challenge. Second, findings from research are primarily shared with a select group of subscribers or funding bodies, limiting their impact and visibility. There is a growing need for research to be more widely disseminated and reach the broader public.Third, there is a lack of support for researchers. PhD aspirants in Nepal face additional financial barriers. Unlike in many other countries, where PhD students receive full funding, students in Nepal often have to pay tuition fees, discouraging many from pursuing advanced research. The government and universities must provide better financial support for PhD students to ensure that talented researchers do not leave the country searching for better opportunities abroad.Barriers faced by academiciansMany Nepali universities do not prioritise quality publications. Sadly, these are not considered a criterion for promotions. Additionally, academic leaders lack awareness of ranked journals and quality parameters and indexes. My conversations with colleagues at various higher education institutions (HEIs) reveal another significant barrier to research productivity: Promotion to administrative roles. Several dedicated researchers find that once they are promoted to dean or associate dean positions, they no longer have the time to conduct research. This problem is compounded by the fact that most HEIs do not allow faculty members the flexibility to focus exclusively on research, forcing them to juggle administrative duties alongside their academic work. Nepali academicians also face significant challenges in accessing up-to-date software for data analysis and quality journals, as most universities in the country do not subscribe to the high-quality academic resources available at many international institutions. This lack of access restricts their ability to publish in reputable outlets. Furthermore, even if a researcher manages to get published in a prestigious journal, universities in Nepal are often unable to cover the article processing charges (APCs), which many institutions abroad pay for. Additionally, unlike reputed Indian HEIs, where faculty are incentivised to produce high-quality research articles and case studies, such a system does not exist in Nepal. As a result, faculty members have little motivation to prioritise research, leading them to focus predominantly on teaching responsibilities. The University Grants Commission (UGC), established under the University Grants Commission Act of 1993, allocates a large portion of its budget—about 50.4 percent—to Tribhuvan University, leaving little for other institutions. The UGC's Research Development and Innovation Programs Implementation Guidelines (2019) aim to support junior faculty members and PhD students, but the process is often challenging. My experience with the UGC when applying for a PhD scholarship was frustrating. Despite meeting the eligibility criteria, my application was rejected without clear reasoning, leaving me disillusioned.Cultivating a research cultureUniversities in Nepal should serve as knowledge centres that actively produce new knowledge. Academicians must seek research funding from domestic and international sources at both the individual and institutional levels. The UGC should develop mechanisms to allocate research funds based on the quality of research output, with clear indicators such as publication in reputable journals and citation counts. Those who contribute significantly to high-quality research should be incentivised, ensuring their work gains recognition within Nepal and the global academic community. Without such incentives, research in Nepal will remain underappreciated and disconnected from the broader international research landscape. In conclusion, cultivating a genuine research culture in Nepal requires concerted efforts from all stakeholders. Leaders in academia, governments and businesses must all recognise the importance of research for scholarly and broader national growth. With sufficient financing, institutional support and dedication to scientific rigour, Nepal can foster an atmosphere where research flourishes and advances knowledge worldwide. \nAlthough pregnancy is a hopeful period in a woman’s life, it is regrettably a tragic experience for many Nepali women. Across the country, Nepali mothers continue to risk their lives while giving birth. While Article 38 of the Constitution of Nepal asserts that every woman shall have the right to safe motherhood and reproductive health, Nepali women are nowhere close to fully exercising their reproductive rights. This failure to ensure safe motherhood is yet another reminder of the country’s perpetual neglect in protecting the rights and lives of its women.In Nepal, safe motherhood was identified as a national priority with the launch of the National Safe Motherhood Programme in 1998. Later, the country even received the Millenium Development Goals award for bringing down its maternal mortality rate (MMR) from 539 per 100,000 live births in 1996 to 239 in 2016. However, progress in maternal deaths has since stalled. In the fiscal year 2023-2024, at least 190 women from 51 districts died of complications during childbirth, as per the data from the Family Welfare Division under the Department of Health Service. In the previous fiscal year, 191 maternal deaths were recorded across 49 districts. Although the country has committed to reducing the MMR to 70 per 100,000 births by 2030 in order to meet the Sustainable Development Goals target, given the current trends, this appears ambitious. Nepal has already missed its target of reducing MMR to 125 per 100,000 live births by 2020. According to experts, postpartum haemorrhage and pre-eclampsia (pregnancy-related high blood pressure disorders) are the chief causes of maternal deaths in Nepal. To identify the number and causes of fatalities, maternal and perinatal death surveillance programmes are imperative. However, instead of full scale implementation of such a fundamental programme, these are being conducted in only 51 districts due to inadequate budget. Such miscalculation can create considerable knowledge gaps related to maternal mortality and care, the knowledge that is vital for introducing targeted interventions. Since the adoption of federalism, the country’s health system management has been delegated to provincial and local governments. Local governments can now implement health offices and facilities. However, this hasn’t produced satisfactory results as many health posts and primary health centres are just buildings, with a severe lack of medical supplies and skilled health workers. Although the government has prioritised maternal health-related programmes and policies, which are on paper progressive, they need to be locally relevant and require routine monitoring and revisits. For instance, lack of competent, Skilled Birth Attendants (SBA) is still a major issue, even though the country formulated the SBA policy in 2005. The long-term strategy to educate and deploy better trained midwives is yet to materialise, leading to the ongoing training of Auxiliary Nurse Midwives, basic nursing cadres, as SBAs.This state of affairs is untenable. Infrastructure accessibility and quality healthcare availability should go together during policy implementation. Many people in remote areas still seek faith healers during childbirth and only consider medical services in emergencies. So introducing facilities without communicating their importance to the people is not enough. Additionally, the government must prioritise marginalised communities while ensuring birth preparedness, financial incentives, free delivery services, abortion care and community-based partum care programmes. Further empowerment of local governments and improved coordination between the federal and provincial levels would also help. The failure to ensure good health for our young mothers puts the future of upcoming generations and, by extension, the country’s future, in jeopardy.  \nNepalis with disabilities face the daily ordeal of navigating cities that are not built for them. Whenever roads and sidewalks are built or expanded, the disabled community harbours hope of easier mobility. However, the authorities either overlook the accessibility for such people or carelessly build structures that are supposed to assist them. This renders people not only disabled by their conditions but also by infrastructural shortcomings. According to the National Census 2021, 2.2 percent of Nepal’s population has some form of disability; 2.5 percent of males and 2 percent of females have a disability. The country ratified the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities in December 2009. Moreover, the provisions in the Disability Rights Act ensure accessibility to physical infrastructure. Although Nepal has a progressive policy on the rights of people with disabilities, the implementation part has been lagging. An audit published by the National Federation of the Disabled-Nepal on 150 public infrastructure sites in Kathmandu showed that no samples were completely accessible: 132 samples were found “not accessible”, while the rest were “partially accessible”. In 2021, the Department of Roads allocated Rs 50 million for disabled-friendly pavements and even completed the first phase, a 1.5km stretch from Putalisadak to Thapathali. Although this is commendable, these supposedly disabled-friendly pavements need routine monitoring, as most of the tactile pavings built earlier ended abruptly or led to electricity poles, trees, walls or drains. Generalising disabilities and offering solutions that only cater to a specific group is also problematic. Most of the time, the authorities build tactile paving and label the area disability-friendly. However, problems of people with other forms of physical and intellectual disability—such as lack of tactile or audio indicators at zebra crossings, narrow sidewalks and absence of ramps—remain unaddressed.Although road accidents occasionally make headlines, accidents involving people with disabilities rarely get noticed. Many unreported cases involve people with disabilities falling into rivers or drains, collisions with poles or trees due to ineffective tactile blocks, and hit-and-run cases while crossing roads. These accidents can be avoided if basic assistance like railings, ramps, audio and tactile indicators, etc are ensured. In many instances, these problems arise not from the lack of disability-friendly infrastructures but from the general mismanagement and poor condition of public infrastructures. Potholes are a common sight on older roads and even some newer ones in Kathmandu. With the city’s rapid urbanisation, construction is happening every few metres. Building materials are often placed on sidewalks that are already narrow, leaving pedestrians with no choice but to walk on the roads. This poses a risk for everyone and could be perilous for people with disabilities. Moreover, the roads that seem perfectly fine the previous day are under maintenance the next day. The authorities do not consider providing an alternative disability-friendly route. Even the signs that inform of the situation of the roads ahead are ineffective. Doing the bare minimum to check the inclusivity list is not an option. Many government office buildings in Nepal are not disability-friendly, and the same applies to institutions like schools and universities. This is also due to the lack of proper budget, as disabled-friendly infrastructures are often not prioritised, depriving a significant and capable portion of the population of their fundamental rights. The government must ensure that people with disabilities have the rights that are promised in the constitution. As for our part as citizens, we must abandon our primitive mindset and be more inclusive of people with disabilities in our thoughts and actions. It’s time we realise that an inclusive nation leaves no one behind as it progresses.  \nNearly two weeks after the rain-induced disasters and even as the festive season is already underway, victims in the hardest-hit areas still await rescue and relief. On Friday, the government declared several disaster-affected local units in 14 districts “disaster crisis zones” to accelerate rehabilitation, recovery and reconstruction efforts. Although this was much needed, it also leaves us wondering whether this is yet another perfunctory step. This is evident from last year’s figures, as among the 865 families displaced from landslides, only 300 have had second instalment relief to rebuild houses; the rest haven’t even started reconstruction works. Many people in disaster-ravaged areas are living in isolation, without electricity and drinking water. Kavrepalanchowk, a hill district of Bagmati Province, has been one of the worst-affected areas by landslides and floods from the September 27 and 28 rains, which have claimed 78 lives in the district so far. Accessibility is a big hurdle for relief and rehabilitation due to the geographical remoteness of the areas and the disruption of the roads caused by floods and landslides. However, some organisations have figured out ways to address this challenge effectively.A recent Post report from Kavrepalanchowk about how a non-profit organisation called Hami Nepal used a drone to transport relief materials to Magargaun from Kalanti in ward 12 of Panauti Municipality has kindled hope among such affected communities. The drone, which can transport goods up to 4 to 5 kilometres, took 600kg of relief materials to disaster-hit areas in the district on Sunday. When rescue and relief workers from the central level cannot access areas post-disaster, local units must be the first responders. However, agencies under local units lack expertise and funds and are ill-prepared to tackle emerging problems. Additionally, the government lacks institutions that solely focus on enhancing the nation’s ability to manage disasters. The Department of Water-Induced Disaster Management, previously known as the Disaster Prevention Technical Centre, has been merged with other departments whose primary functions differ considerably from strengthening local capacity to handle floods and landslides. Indeed, the government failed miserably to mitigate the impacts of a predictable disaster; it must now prioritise swift and effective post-disaster response. Although the severity of the disaster this time was unprecedented, monsoons in Nepal bring havoc every year. However, only when the disaster strikes do the authorities spring into action. Such a reactive response puts the lives of many people at risk, every single year. Many donor agencies and non-governmental and non-profit organisations have been relentlessly working to save lives since the disaster hit the communities and are better equipped and trained. Perhaps the government can both learn and partner with them to facilitate the exchange of knowledge, skills, expertise, resources, and grassroots experiences during such a crisis. A bottom-up approach is warranted, with the local units better equipped with training, funding and awareness. Moreover, collaboration between local and national units must be strengthened for effective disaster response and communication.As the declaration of disaster “crisis zone” remains in effect for three months and authorities plan to restore roads and private buildings while providing rehabilitation and relief in this time frame, they must expedite their actions and ensure that victims do not face a challenging winter ahead.  \nCentral and eastern parts of Nepal witnessed devastating incidents of landslides and floods last week. At least 244 people were killed, while 19 are still missing. The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal sat down with Basanta Raj Adhikari, director at the Centre for Disaster Studies, Institute of Engineering at Tribhuvan University, to discuss how the country can be better prepared to manage the disasters and minimise damages.Recently we faced disastrous floods and landslides. How do you analyse the losses? Could the damages have been reduced with better preparation and timely response?To begin with, I want to make one thing clear. There is a fundamental difference between a disaster and hazard. Hazard is always natural but it becomes a disaster if there is human involvement. If there is a landslide in a jungle with no human activity, it is a hazard. If a landslide hit a human settlement and it required external involvement to restore the place, then it becomes a disaster. An earthquake is a hazard but it becomes a disaster when man-made structures kill people. As far as the losses from the recent floods are concerned, we could have minimised them with better preparation. For instance, Nakkhu was one of the worst hit areas in the Kathmandu Valley. The river there has drastically narrowed and a human settlement has been developed on the riverbanks in recent years. Human activities in rivers are natural as human civilisations took place on the banks of rivers. But it should be done without disrupting the natural flow of the water. We developed huge settlements encroaching the riverbanks. This invited huge losses. Such activities could have been avoided.As Nepal witnessed record-high rainfalls, were not these losses to be expected? It is true that the country witnessed record rainfalls this season, the highest in the past over five decades. Climate change has caused extreme weather events in recent years. But we can’t blame only natural factors. If you see the images of 2003, it clearly shows that the place where the MediCity Hospital now stands is clearly the floodplain of the Nakkhu river. If you go further downstream, you see a colony. This is how we have encroached riverbanks. We can encroach rivers but it should be done in a scientific way. What is scientific encroachment of rivers?We can model flooding based on the highest volume of water a river can carry. Based on such evidence, we can decide what kind of activities can and cannot be carried out on a riverbank. We can develop settlements but that should be based on scientific evidence and data. Another important concept we should follow is risk sensitive land use planning. Nepal government has already prepared land use maps of all the 753 local units that give vital information about a particular place such as the soil, land capability, risk layer, present land use map, zoning map and cadastral layer. But some people have stopped the authorities from implementing the maps as once they are passed, a land categorised as an agricultural area cannot be converted into commercial land. If that scheme is implemented, one can’t build a house in high flood land. Now the local authorities enforce only the building codes and that don’t include these provisions. That doesn’t inquire whether a building is being built on a riverbank or a landslide susceptible area. In developed countries, those who build in high flood risk areas have to pay more in insurance. Also, areas are categorised based on the chances of occurrence of landslides on the basis of soil type, rock type, geology, distance from a drainage or a road etcetera and structures built there are dealt with accordingly. We are witnessing extreme weather events. In this context, what should we do to prevent more loss in the days ahead?We require an engineering paradigm shift in building infrastructures. The extreme weather patterns have made the data we used to refer to in the past while building infrastructures irrelevant. The data on water levels that were referred to while making a bridge in a river now need to be updated as water levels in our rivers have been rising in recent years. The existing infrastructures can’t withstand that volume of water. We witnessed record rainfalls last week. This can be a reference data for some years. Also, the sedimentation pattern has changed because of human settlements built upstream.Second, we have a generalised rule of building roads across the country. The impact of 200 millilitres of rainfall in Pokhara and rainfall of the same volume in Jhapa is different. As Pokhara experiences rains on a regular basis, the soil in the area can withstand it because it has been weathered by regular rain but the same volume of rainfall can cause more losses in Jhapa because of weak soil there. We thus have to consider the strength of soil while building a structure in a particular place.There is a single road construction method across the country, whether the place is in a high himalayan range, Mahabharat, Shivalik hills or plains. We have to make specific rules for specific places based on the geological and soil structures. The parameters of road construction should be redefined. We are improving the weather forecasting system but now we also need impact-based forecasting to inform the public not only about the volume of likely rainfall but also its likely impact.Where are the problems in our disaster response approach?The Natural Calamity (Relief) Act, 1982 was guided by a fatalistic approach as it saw natural hazards as destined by fate. Then came Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Act, 2017. This change in law is in fact a paradigm shift in disaster management in Nepal. The new law’s perspective is progressive. The new Act changed us from response-centric to preparedness-centric. Legally, we are on a progressive path. But we lag in implementation. We also need to upgrade our skills in handling the situation. Our constitution as well as laws have entrusted local units with the responsibility of handling disaster incidents on their own. The government should make people at the local level aware, and equip and train them for the purpose.Training on some important procedures such as the INSARAG preparedness and response guidelines can be quite effective. Such training and other activities aimed at helping local units to handle disaster incidents should be conducted at the ward levels. “Understanding risk” is an important aspect in disaster management. So common people should be sensitised to the consequences of disaster incidents. You can see people collecting timber from flooded rivers, taking selfies on riverbanks and gathering on a bridge above a roaring river. People at all local wards need to be well-equipped. Those who were swept away at Nakkhu could have been saved if the security personnel and other people there had at least motorboats and life jackets. Our rescue workers now lack even such basic things.Settlements in Nepal’s mountainous and hill areas are located in equally risky zones. What should be done to safeguard them?The mountains in our region are taken as young and the Himalayan range is in the building process. It is also called an active mountain belt. Therefore, we experience frequent earthquakes. Earthquakes cause geomorphological changes. A large number of settlements in Nepal’s hills sit on the debris of old landslides that might have occurred long back. People there should be made aware of the risk and these places be identified. Engineering measures should be taken to make them safe. Scattered populations mainly in the highlands need to be integrated in concentrated settlements.What is the latest status of glaciers and glacial lakes in our mountains?The pace of glacial melting is rising alarmingly because of rising temperature. Earlier, we took only big glacial lakes as threats and gave them more attention but recent incidents showed that even smaller ones pose a threat. The incident of the Thame glacial lake outburst in August showed how the outburst of even a small glacial lake could have a cascading effect. Likewise, the deposits of landslides being piled above 3,000 metres are another serious challenge. Such sediment deposition is increasing in the mountains while there is a huge population downstream. The frequency of cascading hazards has increased, emerging as a major challenge. A landslide blocks a river and when the river breaches the structure built of debris, it causes devastating losses downstream.How can we scientifically prove that the hazards we are seeing were the result of climate change?There has to be scientific evidence to make the link. For instance, the Thame glacial outburst was clearly a climate change-induced hazard as it did not involve human activities. The treeline and snowline are shifting upwards in our mountains. There were no mosquitoes in Mustang until some years ago. Now mosquitos are widespread in the district as temperature there has significantly increased. The crop pattern has changed drastically. Thus we have a number of scientific evidence to show clear signs of climate change in this part of the world. What the government should now do is properly document these climate change-induced incidents following internationally-accepted methods and present them at relevant UN bodies. \nNepal’s economy that has been facing one after another setbacks since the 2015 earthquake has been struggling to bounce back. Last week, two international agencies—the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the Asian Development Bank (ADB)—announced that Nepal’s economy was poised to improve in the upcoming fiscal year. In this context, the Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal sat down with Nara Bahadur Thapa, former executive director of the research department of Nepal Rastra Bank, to discuss the current state of the national economy. The ADB, in its report last week, anticipated Nepal’s economy to grow by 4.9 percent this fiscal. A few days earlier, a visiting IMF team also painted an improving picture of Nepal’s economy. How do you see these projections?Nepal’s economic growth in the past 2-3 years has remained below 5 percent. But successive governments in their fiscal budgets have been setting the target of 6 to 7 percent growth. Also, the budget this year has aimed for 6 percent growth. In the meantime, two donor agencies have painted an improving picture of our economy. The ADB has anticipated 4.9 percent growth. Also, the IMF’s team that visited Nepal on a fact finding mission has projected better prospects. They expected better yield from the agriculture sector as Nepal is witnessing more rains. Last year, the growth of agriculture was 3 percent. Now they expect the sector may grow by 3.5 to 4 percent and that may lift overall growth. They have cited improvement in tourism and increased energy export as other bases. Based on these grounds, the ADB has projected 4.9 percent economic growth. But even the target of 5 percent growth looks ambitious if you analyse economic data available as of now and the steps taken by government agencies. We have witnessed more rain but that doesn’t always do us good. More rain in the late monsoon often damages paddy at the time of harvest. Second, the heavy monsoon has caused huge losses in our infrastructure such as roads and bridges that are vital to keep the daily lives and trade running. This may impact potential economic growth as some vital highways and roads have been badly damaged. These factors may pose a challenge in achieving the targets set by the government and donor agencies. Another important factor is that the ratio of capital formation to GDP [gross domestic product] is consistently decreasing. It was 33.8 in the fiscal year 2018-19, it decreased to 30.5 in 2019-20, to 29.3 in 2020-21, 29.0 in 2021-22, 25.1 in 2022-23 and 24.5 in 2023-24. How can we expect economic growth when capital formation keeps decreasing. We can’t achieve 6 percent growth without first improving the situation of capital formation. Capital formation in the private sector is on a decline and the government hasn’t been able to boost it. On the other hand, capital expenditure was lower in the past fiscal year in comparison to the previous fiscal. There is no strong sign of increasing capital formation even in the coming year. This is because the government has failed to collect revenue as per its own target. The revenue collection ratio is falling. It has come down to 18 percent of GDP, from 22 percent not so long ago. With this, the government’s funding capacity is continuously declining. It has failed even to fulfil its own duties. For instance, it hasn’t been able to pay health insurance bills and or the contractors. Similarly, credit offtake from private banks to the private sector has not increased from 6 percent. It used to be around 15-16 percent. Also, no substantive initiatives have been taken to improve productivity. For this, government agencies have to cut red tape. The private sector isn’t optimistic. We are talking a lot but not working seriously to lay a strong ground for growth.What are the signs that private investors are pessimistic?There is enough liquidity in the banks, and the interest rate is decreasing, but the private sector is not borrowing. Bankers say there is no demand from the sector. This indicates pessimism. None of the big business houses have launched any big projects in recent times. The government talks a lot about the energy sector but it is not doing power purchase agreements (PPAs) with hydropower project developers. We aren’t doing enough to realise the goal of exporting 10,000MW electricity to India. This shows no serious effort is being made to initiate reforms. The capital market has required some urgent reforms. But the government hasn’t appointed office bearers in the regulatory body for the past seven months. The government hasn’t given permission to issue IPOs and FPOs. Hence, the government is keeping two important sectors—energy and capital market—on hold. All these trends and activities suggest it will be a challenge to achieve even moderate economic growth.You pointed to the policy hurdles but the multilateral agencies have hailed the government for policy reforms. The IMF in its statement has welcomed recent amendments to various laws and the ADB has welcomed “the cautiously accommodative monetary policy”. Don’t these statements reflect reality?While making their positions public, the international agencies follow certain norms and criteria. First, they take macro pictures such as the government’s commitments. They take the pledges made by the government in the investment summit seriously. They think the commitments will be implemented. Second, they don’t want to irk the host country by presenting a bleak picture because they are diplomats. They point out possible pitfalls during bilateral and table talks but present themselves diplomatically while making their official statements public.Remittance, tourism and energy export are taken as major bases for economic growth but all three depend on external factors. How reliable can the projection be?Without trading and increasing exports, we can’t progress economically. We need to export to increase production and create jobs. Export is an engine of economic growth. Anyhow, we must increase exports. About your query, the government should tackle such things by strengthening relations with the countries concerned and devise policies and strategies accordingly.Our economy is increasingly dependent on remittance. How risky is it in the long run?Remittance has become a boon for our economy. It has played a tremendous role in poverty reduction. The first Nepal Living Standard Survey (NLSS) conducted by the Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS)—now the National Statistics Office—in 1995-96 showed 42 percent Nepali population living below the poverty line. The latest [fourth] living standard survey has shown the poverty level at 20 percent. It wouldn’t be possible without remittance. Therefore, we can’t undermine the role of remittance in this social transformation. Were not the government’s plans and policies responsible for this achievement?The government role would not have been enough. What government policies have created jobs in Nepal? Are there any schemes worth mentioning? The industrialisation hasn’t increased. It is the industrial sector that creates jobs but the share of the manufacturing sector has come down to 4.87 percent in total GDP. Some years ago, it was nearly 9-10 percent. It shows our economy is being deindustrialised. How can we reduce poverty without providing jobs to the youths? Thus, foreign employment played a vital role in poverty reduction. Second is the role of remittance in maintaining foreign exchange reserves, which is essential to buy things from abroad. We have sufficient foreign exchange reserves because of remittance.Information Technology is now projected as a promising sector in creating jobs and transforming Nepal’s economy. How realistic is this expectation?Four fields can be taken as promising sectors in Nepal—agriculture, tourism, IT and hydropower. The IT sector certainly has a bright future. As our country is land-locked, we have additional challenges in merchandise exports and we can’t be competitive. The IT sector won’t have that barrier so it can be competitive in the international market. But for that the government has to formulate IT-friendly policies. For instance, if a Kathmandu-based Nepali firm wants to sell services in the US, Europe or any other international market, they need liaison offices in those countries. Otherwise, they can’t be competitive and grow. But the government doesn’t provide foreign exchange for them to expand their business abroad.Without this policy reform, Nepalis can’t compete with IT companies from other countries. Similarly, foreign companies need to come and work here so that Nepali youths can learn from them. Foreign banks came to Nepal and Nepali bankers learned. Now Nepali banks are doing good. But our policies aren’t favourable for foreigners interested in setting up IT firms. Also, well-trained IT workers are in shortage. We are progressing but we have to put in extra effort to make transformative changes in this sector.The cooperatives’ scam has emerged as a serious issue. What impact may it cause in the national economy if it’s not resolved soon?The cooperative sector played a vital role in creating financial inclusion in our economy by making 7.3 million people its members. Those who couldn’t do their regular transactions with banks were engaged with cooperatives. If that sector collapses, our state of financial inclusion will decline too. Second, they were major financiers for micro, small and medium enterprises (MSME). Cooperatives are directly linked to entrepreneurship through MSMEs. They played a role in making interest rates of banks more competitive as well as banks and financial institutions were under pressure by the interest rates offered by cooperatives. Now they won’t feel the pressure.In this context, many people may resort to informal transactions. According to the 16th periodic plan, nearly 50 percent of Nepal’s economy is informal. We are under pressure to reduce the portion of the informal economy. But the crisis in the cooperative sector may increase the informal economy as those who were involved in cooperatives, which is a formal sector, are likely to do informal transactions with traders or other individuals.Cooperatives are not well regulated and there are anomalies but they are registered in a government agency, pay taxes, have offices and a record system. They brought people in far-flung villages under a formal channel. If the depositors resort to individual transactions, their money will be unsafe. The constitution accepted them as one of the three pillars—along with the government and the private sector—of the country’s economy. The sector expanded its network where there were no economic activities from the government and private sectors. For instance, the government was providing certain services such as distributing fertilisers, crop seeds, sugar through cooperatives. People will now be deprived of these services. Also, the commercial banks might face complications due to the domino effect of the cooperative scam. For instance, if the government seizes the land put up by a cooperative as a collateral in a bank and sells it to return the deposits, the bank might be in trouble.It is also said that cooperatives were becoming platforms for money laundering. How serious was the problem?Cooperatives didn’t seek a source of money from the depositors while accepting big deposits. They weren’t affiliated to the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) of the central bank and the Anti-Money Laundering/Countering the Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT). Therefore, there is a problem of money laundering. It can be resolved when they get affiliated with the FIU.What initiatives should be taken to address the problems seen in the cooperative sector?A powerful regulatory authority should be established without delay. The authority should work as a dedicated agency to clear the mess. Then, AML/CFT provisions should be implemented, a credit information centre should be set up and a debt recovery tribunal formed, and deposits guaranteed. The concept of self-regulation isn’t enough. These financial infrastructures are essential. \nThe parliamentary special probe committee formed to investigate cooperatives scam submitted its report last week. The government has already started implementing the report. In this context, Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal sat down with the committee chair Surya Thapa for more insights on the probe’s findings and the anomalies in the cooperative sector they saw during the investigation.After your committee submitted the report on cooperatives scam, people have interpreted its findings in different ways. Why the confusion?Our committee prepared, finalised and endorsed the report unanimously. No member registered any dissent. This is an important point. However, people have interpreted its findings a bit differently. The supporters of [Rastriya Swatantra Party chair] Rabi Lamichhane have tried to make it appear like the report has given him a clean chit. They have selectively taken a certain portion of the report which states that Lamichhane’s involvement couldn’t be formally established in the process of transferring funds from cooperatives to the Gorkha Media Network. But a huge amount of money has been provided to the Gorkha Media Network from various cooperatives against the Cooperative Act 2017, which prohibits investment of cooperative deposits to any company. It is seen that Lamichhane is directly involved in spending the funds collected from the cooperatives. Based on that, we have found chair of the media company Gitendra Babu (GB) Rai, the then managing director Rabi Lamichhane, directors Chhabilal Joshi and Kumar Ramtel directly responsible in the misuse of cooperative funds and have asked the government to take action against them as per the existing laws. The aforementioned two aspects are inextricably linked. We didn’t find any evidence of transfer of cooperative funds to Lamichhane’s personal bank account. It is sent to the bank account of the Gorkha Media Network. The KYC form of the Global IME Bank shows that Lamichhane is one of the three holders of the joint account. Any one of the three can issue cheques from the account. The funds invested as loan in the Gorkha Media Network have been transferred to the joint bank account, from where Lamichhane has released money by signing cheques. This is how Lamichhane is directly involved in embezzlement of the cooperative funds. Many argue that as per the cooperative law only those who release money from the cooperatives are held responsible but not those who spend it after it is received at the company. Is that the case?The Cooperative Act 2017 prohibits releasing any loan to a company. But it is sent to the company, where Lamichhane is an owner with 15 percent share and a managing director. And, the money is misused there. An informal statement of GB Rai shows Rs1.20 billion of cooperative deposits has been invested in the media company while our financial analysis shows the amount is Rs654 million. Evidence shows Rs220 million has been directly sent to the media company’s bank account. Depositors have been deprived of their money. Other staff working at the company aren’t responsible but the owners are. They could be charged with cooperative fraud under the Cooperative Act, fraud and duping under the National Penal Code, organised crime cases under the Organised Crime Prevention Act, and money laundering cases under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act. Some individuals involved with various cooperatives including Roshni Gurung of a Butwal-based cooperative told the committee that they deposited millions of rupees in the bank account of a person named Rabi Lamichhane. Kumar Ramtel said the person named Rabi Lamichhane is none other than the Rastriya Swatantra Party chair. Still, the committee couldn’t establish the link. What is the complication?The flow of the money shows the connection but documents to link the transactions are not available. We didn’t find documents with Lamichhane’s signatures and fingerprints that needed to be submitted to get a loan. All the seven cooperatives run by GB Rai were releasing loans without following due procedure. But we have successfully traced the flow of the money. The loan amount created in the name of Rabi Lamichhane in Butwal and deposited by Roshni Gurung had reached the Gorkha Media Network’s bank account which was jointly operated by GB Rai, Rabi Lamichhane and Chhabilal Joshi. This is an established fact. The committee didn’t find any document showing the flow of cooperative money to his personal account. But that alone is insufficient to give him a clean chit as a huge sum has been sent to the media company’s bank account jointly run by three people including Lamichhane. Another sum from the Supreme Cooperative has been deposited to the bank account of Gorkha Media Network. The bank voucher shows Roshni Gurung/Rabi Lamichhane as depositors. The amount also goes to the same joint account.Now the government has forwarded the report to the investigation agencies. Do you think the agencies can unearth the missing documents?Our committee worked in a different way to regular House committees. We followed methods of investigation just like the police investigation agencies and government’s prosecution agencies do. We recorded the suspects’ statements, took their fingerprints, and got the signatures to authenticate their statements. I believe this is a new practice by a Nepali parliamentary committee. Sufficient evidence has already been gathered in the past as well. While carrying out this task and preparing the 1,124-page document, we have followed the norms and procedures of an investigation body.During the interrogation, many suspects told the committee that they knew nothing and shifted the responsibility to GB Rai, who is on the run. Those from seven cooperatives–Hamro Nayakrishi Multipurpose Cooperatives; Swarnalaxmi; Supreme; Suryadarshan; Sahara; Samanata and Sano Paila and the officials from Gorkha Media Network gave such answers. Their common answer is, “I don’t know about this, GB Rai does.” Many of them might have been trying to evade their responsibility by blaming Rai. The government has failed to produce Rai. Won’t this investigation be incomplete in his absence?Based on its facts and evidence, the investigation report is complete. Yes, 29 suspects including GB Rai are at large. They are believed to be staying abroad. Their statements have not been recorded. But that doesn’t make the investigation incomplete. We have accessed the database of Gorkha Media Network and other cooperative organisations, collected important documents and analysed them. There is no confusion about the money embezzled in the scam. We have determined a total of Rs2.58 billion from various cooperatives has been misused by investing in several organisations including the Gorkha Media Network, Nature Nest, Nature Herbs, Gorkha Group of Investment, Gorkha Ayurved Company—49 people were responsible for these investments, including GB Rai. Of that, Rs654 million has been invested in Gorkha Media Network. A total of Rs8 billion has been embezzled in the seven cooperatives where Rai is involved. So the investigation is complete. During the interrogation, some office bearers of cooperatives claimed they had no role in the transactions as they were dummy officials and GB Rai and some individuals Rai trusted did everything. How convincing is that?The practice of creating dummy officials, fake documents, false marriages and divorces etcetera is rampant in the cooperative sector. In the seven cooperatives GB Rai is at the centre. He has at least one key person in each of these seven cooperatives as chair or manager and carries out everything through them. In some of them, the chairpersons know nothing. The cooperatives don’t follow any norms, rules and regulations of cooperatives. They work just on the basis of orders they get from Rai or his trusted individuals over the phone. Rai gets advice from a California-based individual named Gyan Bahadur Bamjan. The Cooperative Act prohibits an individual from being a member of more than one cooperative but Rai is involved in at least seven cooperatives as a chair, secretary, vice-chair or patron.The government has decided to implement the report. How should the state agencies work to bring good results?The government should immediately initiate action against four persons—Rabi Lamichhane, GB Rai, Chhabilal Joshi and Kumar Ramtel—as the report has found them responsible for misusing cooperative funds. We have also determined the roles and responsibilities of around 1,000 individuals who were chair, vice-chairs, secretaries, treasurers, account chiefs or others who in decision making roles in 40 cooperatives we were tasked to investigate. They should be brought under investigation and their properties should be seized so as to create an environment to return the depositors’ money.Different arrangements need to be made about those who are in judicial custody. They should be released, their all documents including passports seized and they should be kept under surveillance and allowed to take initiatives to return the depositors’ money. The government, while unveiling the fiscal budget, had announced to take initiatives to return deposits upto Rs500,000 by keeping cooperatives’ assets as collateral. This process should be expedited. Likewise, the government should set up an all-powerful regulatory authority. At present, all the 753 local governments, seven provincial governments and the federal government have the regulatory role. That is pointless. Now a strong dedicated regulatory authority should be formed. The Crisis-ridden Cooperatives Management Committee is there but it should be made more effective by giving it greater executive powers. When a cooperative is in crisis, the regulatory body should take over its management and fix the crisis just like Nepal Rastra Bank does in the banking sector.What patterns of anomalies did you find in the cooperatives?The fundamental idea of a cooperative is to run by its own members based on self-regulation. But a few board members were found to be using all the authority and misusing the funds while members were unaware about the affairs in the organisations. The board members use most of the resources for their relatives and other closed ones. Annual meetings are organised as picnics and wedding parties. In some cases, annual meetings are fake, audit reports, auditors and signatures, all are fake.In the course of preparing the committee report, I have coined terms like ‘cooperative divorce’ and ‘cooperative marriage’. Divorce and marriage documents are prepared based on the fortune of the cooperatives. There was misappropriation of Rs120 million in a cooperative, where Jyoti Gurung was manager, in 2075 BS. Dhan Raj Gurung, who is Nepali Congress Vice-president, divorced his wife Jyoti in 2076 BS. But, in 2077, Dhan Raj presented himself as a guarantor of a loan to Jyoti. Again in 2080, both of them jointly paid back a loan of Rs9.1 million. This is a bit of a trend in the cooperative sector.Do you think we need to reconsider the basic idea of cooperatives as self-regulated organisations?In the report, we haven’t questioned its principle, need and importance. Cooperative sector is vital for our economy. But the concept of self-regulation as stated in the Cooperative Act 2017 has failed. Now, this sector should be overseen by a strong regulatory body. Still, the idea of self-regulation can be given continuity as the members should be allowed to run the cooperatives on their own but their activities should be strictly regulated by a powerful authority. Moreover, the cooperatives that do big transactions should be regulated by the central bank.Why did the present regulatory bodies fail?There were over 50 lawmakers who proudly identified themselves as office bearers of certain cooperatives. They over-emphasised self-regulation and undermined the role of regulatory bodies. Individuals like GB Rai and other fraudsters benefited from that. Therefore, we recommended stringent laws and a stronger regulatory authority. \nNepal is marking its ninth Constitution Day on Thursday. The country’s two largest parties—the Nepali Congress and the CPN-UML—formed a coalition government a month ago with a commitment to reviewing and amending the constitution. In this context, Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal and Binod Ghimire sat down with constitutional expert Purna Man Shakya to discuss the good and bad aspects of the constitution amendment process.The Congress and the UML have floated a proposal to amend the constitution. Is the time ripe to make changes in our statute?Generally, constitutions are reviewed after around a decade of their implementation. So, we have come to the stage of reviewing whether our constitution has functioned properly. However, the sudden announcement of the amendment is premature, as this is a serious business. In our case, the constitution can’t be amended just based on the interest of one or two parties. It requires a national consensus. There should be an understanding among the political parties represented in Parliament. And, a sort of consensus even among the people’s level is important as there was huge public involvement in making this constitution. Sentiment of various communities must be respected while making any changes in the national charter. What can be the modality of seeking consensus at the people’s level? Should a draft be prepared and opened up for debate?While making changes in the constitution, some issues might be technical and not of interest to common people. But if any changes are made in policy issues that can alter our country’s structural dynamics, the concerned communities must be consulted. Just the present strength of the political parties represented in Parliament is no guarantee that they truly represent people. For instance, the Maoists emerged as the largest party through the election in 2008. But it has been shrunk to a distant third in the House. However, we can’t conclude from this that the people have discarded the party’s agenda. The Maoists might have been discredited due to their activities and failure in delivery but people might still favour the agenda they once championed. Similar is the case with other parties. Therefore, we have to consider broader consensus both in Parliament as well as the people’s level.How challenging is it to enter the constitution amendment process?Any amendment calls for a two-thirds majority in the House of Representatives as well as the National Assembly in the federal parliament. If an issue is linked to provincial authority, it should be endorsed by the majority [four] of seven provinces. So, this is not easy. Therefore, the parties should tread carefully.You mentioned earlier that constitution amendments without a review process is not a right step. Could you elaborate?The right way is to first have broad understanding among the top leaders of political forces on the issues and then constitute a panel of experts to conduct a comprehensive study on that. Such studies are conducted through two methods—doctrinal and non-doctrinal. The doctrinal method analyses related literature and principles on theoretical approach while the non-doctrinal method studies the public sentiments and opinions through surveys and interactions, and comes up with certain methodologies with the help of subject experts. Through such study, the experts identify the issues and recommend the ways to the politicians. This is the right process.There are also arguments that reviewing the constitution without even bringing it into full-fledged implementation is wrong. Based on the practice during these years, we have concluded that certain provisions didn’t work properly. It is true that we are talking about making changes in the constitution without even implementing certain provisions. First we have to give the system an opportunity to work in a full-fledged way. Then, we can evaluate whether it worked. Any move to dissolve the system without properly implementing it will create divisions and invite another conflict. A question that is often asked: Is there a problem with our constitution or with our politicians? People can change the constitution but the constitution can’t change the people. Therefore, a constitution should be developed also on the basis of the nature of people in the country who use it. If our political parties and the politicians had reformed themselves, we might not have had to discuss constitutional changes time and again. We should have made the system strong for more effective checks and balances and made leaders and officials more accountable. The ruling parties reason that the constitution amendment became necessary to ensure political stability.When a federal government is changed, its aftershocks are immediately seen in all seven provincial governments. It directly impacts development and other activities across the country. It’s a flaw in our party system but we have to find a solution in the system. We see people raising voices for two things—stability and retirement of old politicians. As Nepali politicians never retire voluntarily, we have to address it through the system. Direct election of executive head can be one way to address this problem. People have found local governments more effective than federal and provincial governments. It is because chiefs and representatives of local governments are directly elected and they can serve the full five-year term.Once people are given the right to elect heads of government, they won’t elect old faces such as KP Oli, Sher Bahadur Deuba and Prachanda [Pushpa Kamal Dahal], who have been tested multiple times. It will serve two purposes—first, it gives stability and second, it allows popular leaders to emerge in place of the old ones. The old leaders have maintained control over national politics through their huge party organisations. But when people directly elect presidents and chief ministers their grip over party organisations can’t be decisive in national politics. For that we have to amend the constitution.However, again, an expert team needs to thoroughly study the pros and cons of such changes. But what I can say based on the general study of public perception is that we can first go for direct election of executive heads at the provincial level. In the next phase we can go for direct presidential election at the federal level.What went wrong in the practice of the three-tier federal system?While adopting federalism, the basic idea was to allow the local governments to oversee local matters while the provincial governments would handle wide ranges of issues related to agriculture, industry, forest, education and health, etcetera. If the two sub-national governments handle these things, people don’t need to come to the centre seeking solutions to their problems. In such a scenario, the federal government can focus on important affairs such as foreign relations, defence, telecommunication, currency, national infrastructure projects and inter-provincial affairs. Such division of powers would automatically create specialisation in the respective governments.But the federal system is not implemented as per that spirit. Provinces aren’t allowed to exercise their rights. People are still travelling to Kathmandu all the way from remote districts even for basic things. The constitution has mandated the provinces to maintain law and order in their respective provinces but the federal government hasn’t allowed them to have their own police forces. Provinces without police have become like administrative units. The centre has a huge bureaucracy in Kathmandu. It is high time that the centre delegates authority to provinces as per the constitutional spirit. Federal lawmakers have huge interest in local development activities because it is directly related to their election. They don’t want to lose this influence. The interest of federal lawmakers however contradicts with the constitution.There is also a belief that the local level has authority in areas where they can’t work effectively, for instance they are mandated to oversee the education system up to grade 12 while provinces don’t have much role. Do you think such jurisdictional matters need to be reviewed and provinces should be given more authority?That’s right. First of all, we should be clear that there is no point in adopting a federal system if we don’t want provinces because we had central and local levels even in the past. Provincial layer is an integral part of federalism. So, we have to think about transferring certain rights from local to provincial level because the local units don’t have expertise to oversee education up to grade 12 on their own. Our local units are traditionally trained in local development activities. But now they are entrusted with the responsibility of not only overseeing education and health issues but also with legislative and judicial functions. They haven’t been able to play that role. We should think about transferring some roles from local to provincial levels. Likewise, the centre should be ready to allow the provinces to exercise their rights bestowed by the constitution. It is time to strengthen the provinces.You said direct election of executive heads in provinces could end instability at the provincial level. But what if a popular leader got elected chief minister but other political parties won majority seats in the provincial assemblies? In such a situation, the rival parties may not help the chief minister pass a budget or policies from the assembly.Yes, there are strengths and weaknesses of all systems. Such problems can be resolved because we see similar situations in other countries as well. Parties can’t prolong the deadlock in the House because they will be blamed for the impasse. One basis is that our local units are doing well under executive heads. So, we can practise it for a decade in the provinces and then apply it to the federal level based on that experience.Many forces and groups that aren’t happy with the present constitution, which was basically a compromise document. Once the constitution amendment process is open, they are certain to revive their demands. Will the situation be manageable?If the rights of historically marginalised communities are curtailed, they will certainly retaliate. If you try to go against the federal republic system and policy of inclusion, it may invite new conflicts. The proportional representation system is not a problem. Leaders made it unpopular by misusing it. We should find solutions to stop its misuse. We shouldn’t forget that this constitution is not only a constitution but also a key document of our peace process. This is not perfect but it was essential to end the conflict. Many say that while making a document of compromise, our constitution hasn’t followed the principles of constitutionalism. For instance, the hearing system is something unusual in a parliamentary system. As a constitutional expert, do you think we should also think about fixing such deviations?You are right. When we couldn’t change the people, we tried to add additional features as a measure to check the wrongdoings. Our leaders make appointments in key constitutional bodies guided by their personal and partisan interests. We copied the hearing practice from the presidential system with a view to check the leaders’ arbitrary appointments. It hasn’t been that effective. Therefore, we have proposed to give continuity to the hearing for political appointments but not in the appointments of judges because lawmakers don’t have the expertise to examine judges’ competence. Since lawmakers are mainly guided by the party’s whip and top leaders’ instructions, it rather increases political interference even in the judiciary. We have thus proposed to stop the hearing process for judges’ appointments.Many say that the judiciary hasn’t been federalized even though all other sectors have been restructured as per the three-tier federal system. Why this exception for the judiciary?Oh, you dragged me to a sensitive topic. One thing we shouldn’t forget is that we adopted a federal system not to unify small countries. We were already a united country. We adopted it to better manage our social diversity by involving all the communities in the governing system. We at the same time have to safeguard the country from disintegration. Judiciary, the national army and Nepali language are our institutional arrangements that can play a unifying role. Therefore, we didn’t make much changes in these three aspects.Some instances show that Nepal’s federalism might have been a bit more effective had the judiciary worked proactively. For instance, the court hasn’t decided even the cases filed by provinces years ago. What do you think about the judiciary’s role in this connection?Yes, those cases are still undecided. In the Constituent Assembly, the Maoist party had registered a proposal to form a separate constitutional court. The justices who were leading the judiciary at the time opposed the idea. It was later rejected. Then the idea to have a separate constitutional bench was included as a compromise deal. But it has failed to work effectively. It failed to decide election-related disputes. We have to review its jurisdiction. They have decided certain cases when there is public pressure. For instance they decided cases like House dissolution because there was constant public scrutiny. But they haven’t shown any interest in other important cases where constitutional interpretation is needed. Of late, a strong opinion is being built in favour of forming a separate constitutional court. These issues are being discussed seriously. This issue may emerge if the constitution amendment process begins.What we can infer from your analysis is that the constitution amendment process is not that easy. What are the basic things that should be and can be done in the constitution amendment at this stage?First, we should change the form of governance at the provincial level and go for a directly elected executive head. With this there will be no change in government in provinces after changes at the centre. The governments in provinces can work for five years with certainty. Second, we can transfer the powers that the local units have failed to exercise to provinces. And, the centre should allow the provinces to exercise the concurrent rights. By doing this the centre can reduce the overwhelming burden on it. While the provinces can play an implementing role, the federation can play a supervisory role. These things need to be fixed. We need some amendments to the constitution and some new laws for this. \nThe weather is forecast to be partly to generally cloudy in the hilly areas of the country on Thursday with partly cloudy to mainly fair weather elsewhere.

Write it in the form of inspiring story not news article or event.\n    \n    Story:\nOnce upon a time, nestled between the towering peaks of the Himalayas and the lush jungles of the Terai, there was a country named Nepal. Though still a developing nation, Nepal was a land of profound beauty and deep-rooted cultural heritage. The residents of Nepal faced many challenges, but beneath these hardships lay a resilient spirit and an unyielding hope for the future.\n\nThis enchanting land, where Mount Everest reaches towards the skies and the air carries a mix of incense and cool mountain breezes, was more than a geographical marvel. It was a mosaic of cultures, languages, and traditions, a testament to human endeavor against all odds. Nepal's history, from the unification under King Prithvi Narayan Shah to its transformation into a federal democratic republic, told a story of aspiration and endurance.\n\nIn recent years, the people of Nepal, with their indomitable will, had taken strides towards rebuilding and reimagining their country. They turned their struggles into stepping stones, each challenge a chapter in their ongoing saga. The shift from a monarchy to a republic had not only changed governance but had woven a new tapestry of democratic values and collective decision-making.\n\nEconomically, while agriculture continued to sustain a large part of its population, Nepal had begun to harness the potential of its picturesque landscapes, developing sustainable tourism that promised to preserve their natural heritage while boosting local economies. Communities living in the shadows of the Himalayas had become stewards of the earth, protecting the biodiversity that made their country unique.\n\nEach day brought new stories. Whether it was a festival in Kathmandu, a technological advance in Pokhara, or a conservation effort in Chitwan, these events were threads in the vibrant quilt of Nepali life. These stories, updated daily, reflected the pulse of progress and the spirit of hope that characterized this resilient nation.\n\nAnd so, as Nepal moved forward, each moment was not just a passage of time but a promise of potential, a narrative of a nation perennially climbing towards tomorrow, guided by the legacy of its past and the dreams of its future.\n\nNews events:\nThe government has intervened in the dispute over the management of Gaushala Dharmashala between Pashupati Area Development Trust (PADT) and the Marwadi Sewa Samiti.In a letter on Thursday, the Ministry of Culture, Tourism and Civil Aviation has asked the PADT to halt the process of claiming the Dharmashala (charity lodge for pilgrims) property, northwest of Gaushala crossroads. Badri Prasad Pandey, the culture minister and an ex-officio chairperson of the PADT, has also called a meeting of the PADT Council for Sunday to resolve the matter.“Suspend all actions to implement the October 6 decision of the council [to take possession of the Dharmashala] until its [the council’s] next meeting,” reads the letter, adding that the move has led to insecurity in the Pashupati area. On October 6, a council’s meeting chaired by Pandey had decided to hand over the Dharmashala to the Kathmandu Metropolitan City. However, the minister has backtracked on the decision within 10 days following strong opposition from the Marwadi community, a prominent business group in Nepal.“We were working to implement the council’s decision. Now we have been asked to backtrack,” an official at the PADT told the Post. “Let's see how things unfold.” On May 23, 2003, the PADT and the Samiti had forged an agreement allowing the latter to manage the Dharmashala, paying an annual rent of Rs51,000. For the past few years, the trust has been requesting the Samiti to agree to pay more in rent. Following the Samiti’s reluctance to increase the payment, the council, on August 2 last year, terminated the two-decade-old agreement. Challenging the decision, the Samiti moved the Kathmandu District Court. But on October 2, the court scrapped the case, saying that the Samiti had failed to substantiate its claim. Four days later, the council’s meeting on October 6 decided to bring over 9.5 ropani (0.48 hectares) of land and infrastructure erected on it under its possession. It also decided to give the Kathmandu Metropolitan City the responsibility of managing the property.Since then, the PADT and the metropolis have been trying to vacate the property. However, people associated with the Samiti, a philanthropic organisation of the Marwadi community, have been obstructing them. They thwarted the metropolis’ attempt on Tuesday, which had made similar failed attempts on October 9. With repeated resistance from the Samiti, the metropolis administration on Tuesday wrote to the District Administration Office, Kathmandu to help claim the land and property. Similarly, the trust also held a press conference where it claimed the Samiti was in fact eying the land that belongs to the Pashupati temple.Officials also claimed that the Samiti was illegally obstructing the trust’s attempt to manage the Dharamshala, which is the trust’s property. The trust has also said the property will be used purely for religious purposes. Currently, the Samiti has been running hotels, lodges and restaurants, among other things, at the Dharmashala.However, the Samiti says it is wrong on the part of the trust and the metropolis to forcibly vacate the property even before the court has issued its full text. The Samiti asserts that it has tenancy rights to the Dharmashala property. Issuing an audio-visual statement on Sunday, it said the Gaushala Dharmashala has been under its possession for decades, long before it had reached an agreement with the Pashupati Area Development Trust in 2003. “The termination of the agreement doesn’t end the Marwadi Sewa Samiti’s possession of the property,\" it says. Those with knowledge of the Pashunath temple’s property support Samiti’s claim, saying the Marwadi community has managed the land and property for decades, long before the trust existed. Narottam Baidya, former member secretary of the trust and a Nepali Congress leader, had said the land was given to the Marwadi community for use as a cow shed by then Prime Minister Juddha Sumsher Rana in 1937 AD. It was a reward for their service to the victims of the 1934 Great Earthquake. The cow shed would provide the milk needed for worship in the Pashupatinath Temple every day. “Later, during the land survey, Gausahala Dharmashala managed by Marwadi Sewa Samiti was named as mohi (tenant) of the land,” Baidya had told the Post on Tuesday.Officials from the trust, however, dispute the claim that the Samiti has tenancy rights to the land. They say Juddha Saumsher Rana gave the land for use as a cow shed, not for running commercial outlets. The Samiti has no permission to erect any infrastructure in the land, says a statement from the PADT issued on Tuesday.The Samiti came into existence only in 2001 after being registered at the District Administration Office, Kathmandu, it claims.As per PADT officials, the Samiti is earning more than Rs6.1 million annually from the property, but paying peanuts to the trust. They also said that a seven-point agreement signed between the trust and the metropolis stipulates that the property should be used for non-commercial purposes, contrary to what the Samiti is currently doing.The PADT has cited additional evidence to support its claim to the property. In October 2006, after studying the matter, the Public Accounts Committee of the House of Representatives had recommended that the Trust take over the operation of the Dharmashala.The Auditor General’s Office made similar suggestions that same year. It has been pointed out that Samiti was refusing to revise its payment in violation of the provisions in the agreement with the trust. Now the council’s meeting on Sunday will decide how the ownership row moves ahead. “How can the council backtrack from the October 9 decision? How can they justify it?\" questioned the earlier-quoted PADT official. \nThe Political Parties Act-2017, which was nullified through an ordinance three years ago, has not been replaced, creating a legal void over the registration of new political parties.The Act has a provision that defines criteria under which dissidents of a political party can split the organisation and form a new outfit if they can prove the support of a certain number of central committee members and lawmakers of the mother party.In August 2021, the then Sher Bahadur Deuba-led government issued an ordinance to ease party split. It changed the provision, paving the way for 20 percent of the party’s central committee members and 20 percent lawmakers to form a new party. Earlier, any dissident group had to prove support of 40 percent central committee members and 40 percent lawmakers to register a new organisation. The law was tweaked to help the then CPN-UML leader Madhav Kumar Nepal and Janata Samajbadi Party Nepal’s Mahantha Thakur launch their own parties. Nepal at the time had supported the agitation led by Congress and Maoist Centre against UML chair KP Sharma Oli, who as the prime minister had dissolved the House of Representatives. The Article 114 (2) of the constitution states that an ordinance shall be tabled at the session of both Houses of the Federal Parliament held after the promulgation, and if not passed by both Houses, it shall ipso facto cease to be effective at the expiration of 60 days from the day on which a meeting of both Houses is held.Amid the legal confusion, the Election Commission registered the Ashok Rai-led Janata Samajbadi Party (JSP) in May. A dissident group led by Rai split the Janata Samajbadi Party-Nepal (JSP-Nepal) led by Upendra Yadav.The Election Commission then recognised the Rai-led party based on the Political Parties Act 2017 and registered it with the commission as per the Act’s Section 33 and Rule 5 of the Regulations on Political Parties 2017. However, three years ago, the Act’s provision was scrapped through an ordinance. Soon after the party split, Upendra Yadav moved the Supreme Court, challenging the Election Commission’s decision to recognise its splinter group as a new party. In his petition, Yadav claimed the commission registered the party despite failing to fulfil the required 40 percent support of central members for a split. While splitting the party, Rai had the support of seven of 12 lawmakers in the House of Representatives. However, he only had the support of 35 central committee members. According to the Election Commission, the party had 406 central committee members registered with the commission before its split to form the Janata Samajbadi Party. Thus the Rai-led group, even though it had the support of over 40 percent of the party’s lawmakers, didn’t have support of 40 percent of the central committee members.The case is sub judice in the Supreme Court for the past five months, and the next hearing is scheduled for November 21.Likewise, the Rai-led Janata Samajbadi Party, despite being in the government since the party split, has failed to engage in party’s organisation building activities even five months after its formation. “There have been some hurdles to carrying out party activities due to the court case,” Sushila Shrestha, a lawmaker of the Rai-led party, told the Post. “Despite the difficulties, we have been engaged in party formation activities, though not as proactively as we would like to.”Shrestha accused the big parties in the government of not doing enough to remove the legal void. Manish Kumar Suman, spokesperson of the JSP-Nepal, blames the government for the void. He stressed the need for reinstating the provision of requiring 40 percent of central committee members and 40 percent of lawmakers to split a party.“Our party has moved beyond party split, and we are currently engaged in party building activities,” Suman told the Post. “But should the government bring a new law related to political parties, it should require the support of 40 percent of lawmakers and 40 percent of central committee members to approve a party split.” Minister for Communication and Information Technology Prithvi Subba Gurung, who is also the government spokesperson, blames frequent government changes for the long legal void.“Earlier, the provision related to the split of political parties was made easy through an ordinance with the intent of splitting the UML. But after the goal was achieved, the then government didn’t bother to introduce a new bill to replace the ordinance [which automatically lapsed],” Gurung told the Post. Gurung, the government spokesperson, said he is unaware of any attempt by the present government to reintroduce the provision.Gurung argued that the matter is under the purview of the law ministry.Minister for Law, Justice, and Parliamentary Affairs, Ajay Kumar Chaurasiya, says the legal void won’t last long, even as the current government is not considering introducing new law related to political parties.“There has been no discussion on introducing the provision related to political parties,” Minister Chaurasiya told the Post. While the government is yet to remove the legal void created at the time of formation of the CPN (Unified Socialist), some dissident leaders from the same three-year-old party have reportedly urged Prime Minister and CPN-UML chair KP Sharma Oli to bring the law as they want to split the same party, the Unified Socialist.“But owing to the reluctance of Nepali Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba, Prime Minister Oli has been hesitant to introduce such an ordinance,” a Unified Socialist leader told the Post, asking not to be named for fear of reprisal. Some lawmakers and central committee members of the Unified Socialist are waiting for an opportune moment to split the party and join the UML. If a group of Unified Socialist lawmakers rejoins the UML, the Oli-led communist party, the second-largest in the House of Representatives, may then become the largest.At present, the Congress is the largest in the House of Representatives with 88 seats while the UML has 79 lawmakers.The Madhav Nepal-led party has witnessed serious factional feud following the election of office bearers and politburo members in August. Although the party concluded its general convention on July 5, the election of office bearers and politburo members was conducted later, only to create new rifts within the party. Some leaders even submitted a two-point memorandum to Unified Socialist chair Madhav Kumar Nepal on October 7, seeking to prevent a potential split in the party and warning of a growing threat of leaders and cadres defecting to the UML. “Many of our leaders would have defected had there been a clear legal provision on party split,” a Unified Socialist leader told the Post. \nFifty-three trekking trails were developed in Baglung in the last fiscal year to draw foreigners and local tourists, considering rural tourism's contribution to rural community development.A trekking route has been built to Teuwa, where a statue of Gautam Buddha has been constructed in the Open Sculpture Museum of Galkot Municipality.An hour-long hiking trail to Teuwa from Harichaur has been the latest draw for youth.Similarly, another trekking route has been developed to connect Kot Ghar, which once served as the fortress of the hilly kingdom ruled by the Mallas. The renovated historical palace offers a reason to visit Galkot. Kot Ghar, once considered the seat of powerful Malla kings of Galkot, a pretty kingdom in the confederation of 24 states known as Chaubise Rajya, has been restored and preserved to draw tourists. The Kot Ghar means a house where weapons are placed or stored.Mahadev Sapkota, a tourism entrepreneur, said that the construction of trekking trails in Baur, Kothekhola rural municipality-7 to Gumba has been attracting locals to the two-day hiking trail. In the last fiscal year, local governments constructed 53 trails in the district, spending Rs1 million to Rs2 million in each project.“We have been observing an influx of youth for trekking after the development of trekking trains,” said Prem Lamichhane, chairman of ward 9 of Kothekhola Rural Municipality. Bishnu Nath Sharma, information officer of the Tourism and Industry Office of the Galkot Municipality, said that the trekking routes with homestays have been attracting domestic tourists in the area. The Tourism and Industry Office of the Gandaki province in Baglung funded Rs66 million to construct the trails.Locals said that many infrastructure projects are unfinished, but the construction of trekking routes has become successful and meets the objective of community development.“For hiking of a day or two, the trail has become easy and attractive,” said Saurab Khatri, a youth of ward 9 of Baglung Municipality. “There is a need to promote these destinations to bring tourists.” Khatri prefers to hike rather than use the vehicle. “The trail has grabbed the attention of many youths like us.” In the last fiscal year, 73 tourism infrastructure projects were completed through the Tourism and Industry Office. With the expenditure under Rs500,000 to Rs2 million, most of the projects were trail construction. There are concerns that small projects are delayed and unfinished. Paar Singh Thapa, chief of the Tourism and Industry Office, said the tourism infrastructure project achieves 95 percent of physical progress. The trail has been constructed to connect the religious sites. Besides trekking trails and homestays, meditation centres have been constructed in two Buddhist sites. Thapa said the projects will increase economic activities by alluring tourists and conserving religious places. The office has also invested in developing Durleni, in Baglung, as a tourism destination.The Baglung municipality has allocated Rs25 million to develop the area as a tourism destination. Similarly, the tourism office has invested Rs1.5 million to construct a martyr's memorial park at Argal in ward 2 of Tarakhola Rural Municipality. “Investing in similar work can be repetitive. In such a situation, the office needs to be responsible,” said Amar Thapa, chief of the District Coordination Committee. “We have directed the authorities to prevent the duplication and implement such projects that yield results. The office has made investments to identify many places. A master plan has been formulated to develop tourism sites. Bharat Sharma, mayor of Galkot Municipality, said they had demanded a budget of Rs20 million to develop major sites as per the master plan. However, in some areas, the budget has been frozen as the project did not move ahead. The budget allocated under Ghumte Tourism Development in the last fiscal year was frozen. Rs1.5 million has been invested to maintain Udaya Righa Buddha Bihar, located in Righa Ward No.11 in Galkot, along with the trail. Rs1 million has been allocated for the construction of a tourism trail from Gaighat waterfall of the Tara River to Baraha Lake. Similarly, Rs1 million has been invested to construct tourism infrastructure in Soledada at Tamankhola rural municipality, Rs1 million for the construction of Jaimini Dham Meditation Center, and Rs2 million for tourism infrastructure in Kuduledham. Thapa said that tourism arrivals will rise as infrastructure has been built and renovated in the coming days. Thapa said a temporary assistant engineer from the Tourism and Industry Office is doing all the technical work on the projects. The local government has been trying to preserve the historical artefacts to showcase to visitors. The ancient palace of Galkot was in dire straits because of the lack of conservation.The Shreemeher Battalion barracks of the Nepal Army and Galkot Municipality have jointly renovated the almost-collapsed Kot Ghar. \nFive SAFF Women’s Championship finals in six editions. A 14-year long painful wait for a maiden SAFF trophy. Will Nepal be able to break the title jinx this time?“Our goal is the SAFF championship title,” Nepal captain Anjila Tumbapo Subba said on the eve of the tournament. “Our team is fit and balanced…we are ready.”Nepal begin their bid for a maiden SAFF Women’s Championship title and their first ever major international trophy against Bhutan on Friday.Nepal have played 11 finals in the last two and half decades and have won none.Nepal have been drawn alongside Bhutan, the Maldives and Sri Lanka in Group B. They take on the Maldives in their next group match on Monday before wrapping up the group stage by facing Sri Lanka on Thursday.Coach Rajendra Tamang’s side will be backed by home support once again—like the last two editions (2019 and 2022)—and will enter the competition as favourites.But the task will not be easy.Until 2019, India were the sole dominant force in South Asian women’s football, having won all the first five editions.However, their supremacy in the region came to a brutal end in 2022 when Bangladesh won the title for the first time. India were also beaten 3-0 by Bangladesh in the group stage.Nepal were the finalists and were largely tipped to win the championship after knocking out India in the semi-finals but their woes continued when they lost the final 3-1 to Bangladesh.On paper, these three sides (Nepal, India and Bangladesh) will be the top contenders again.India will look to reclaim the throne they lost two years ago, while Bangladesh will aim to assert themselves as the new powerhouse by winning a second straight title. For Nepal, the opportunity to win a first title is back at home again but they will first need to overcome the challenges of superpowers India and defending champions Bangladesh.“We have played a lot of finals but have not won any. It’s time for the players to step up and motivate themselves to break the jinx,” said coach Tamang, adding that they had been training with complete focus on the trophy despite a short preparation period.“We only had two weeks of training because of the ANFA Women’s League. It would have helped a lot if we were given the opportunity to play a number of international friendlies prior to the tournament.”“But, despite the setbacks, we have prepared well,” added Tamang.Nepal’s star forward Sabitra Bhandari is set to miss at least one match due to her engagement with French Club En Avant Guingamp. \nThe federal government has recommended immediate grants of Rs5 million to 10 million to each of the 71 local units declared disaster crisis zones. The financial assistance is aimed at providing relief and carrying out rehabilitation, and reconstruction works in the disaster-affected areas.In a meeting on Thursday, the executive committee of the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Authority (NDRRMA) proposed the grants in line with the declaration of these 71 local units as disaster-hit zones. The government on October 4 had declared 71 local units in 20 districts as disaster crisis zones.The local units declared disaster crisis zones are from Okhaldhunga, Panchthar, Udaypur, Solukhumbu, Khotang, Ilam, Kavrepalanchok, Lalitpur, Dolakha, Sindhuli, Sindhupalchok, Makawanpur, Dhading, Ramechhap, Chitwan, Rautahat, Mahottari, Sarlahi, Siraha and Saptari districts.The meeting chaired by Home Minister Ramesh Lekhak on Thursday decided that nine of the worst-hit local units would receive Rs10 million each, 12 affected units would get Rs7.5 million each, and the remaining 50 units would be provided with Rs5 million each, according to NDRRMA Spokesperson Dijan Bhattarai.The proposal will now be forwarded to the National Council for Disaster Management, chaired by Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli, in a meeting scheduled for Friday.According to Bhattarai, the allocated funds will be used to restore essential services and purchase supplies such as foods and tarpaulins for relief and rescue operations.Additionally, the meeting decided to allocate a budget for procuring helicopters and equipment needed for disaster rescue operations. It also resolved to request the government to offer free health insurance to the families of those who lost their lives in disaster-related incidents through the Council.In addition to Home Minister Lekhak, Health Minister Pradeep Paudel and Minister for Federal Affairs and General Administration Rajkumar Gupta also attended the meeting. Incessant rainfall on September 27 and 28 ravaged various parts of the country including the Kathmandu Valley. At least 244 people were confirmed dead and 19 people remained unaccounted for during the disasters.  \nNepal secured a 17-run victory in their first match of the T20I series against the United States at Grand Prairie Stadium, Dallas, on Friday.Batting first, the Rhinos posted a challenging total of 164-9 in their 20 overs, with captain Rohit Paudel leading the charge with a valuable 49 from 33 balls. Dipendra Singh Airee made a significant impact, scoring a rapid 28 off 17 balls, providing a late surge to their innings.Nepal got off to a solid start with Anil Sah (27) and Aasif Sheikh (27) forming a partnership of 48 runs. However, the middle order struggled to accelerate, with Kushal Bhurtel (10) and Gulsan Jha (11) falling cheaply.The innings were revived by Paudel and Airee, who added 50 runs for the fifth wicket.Harmeet Singh stood out for the United States, taking two wickets for 18 runs in his four overs, while Saurabh Netravalkar and Jasdeep Singh also picked up two wickets each.In response, the United States faced early setbacks, quickly losing both openers—Monank Patel (3) and Saiteja Mukkamalla (2).Andries Gous tried to steady the ship with a 30-ball 30, but his dismissal in the 10th over left the hosts at a precarious 56-4.Shayan Jahangir fought valiantly, scoring an unbeaten 60 off 34 balls, but his efforts were not enough to chase down Nepal’s total. Despite a late rally, the United States finished on 147-7.Nepal’s bowling was disciplined throughout the innings. Dipendra Singh Airee starred with the ball, taking three crucial wickets for 27 runs, including the important dismissals of Milind Kumar (22) and Jasdeep Singh (16). Karan KC (1-18) and Rijan Dhakal (1-21) also played key roles in restricting the USA’s batting line-up.Airee’s all-round performance earned him the Player of the Match award. \nThe mountainous regions of Nepal are famous for their succulent apples. For farmers in these areas, especially in Karnali Province, apple cultivation is their primary income source. Districts like Jumla, Humla, Kalikot and Dolpa have seen significant increases in apple production through commercial farming, with the province producing over 31,000 tonnes of the fruit last year alone. About the same quantity is expected this year. Yet, as promising as this sounds, it is disheartening that much of this produce never reaches intended markets due to the poor state of roads and other logistical challenges. After living in the shadows for several decades, even the far-flung places of Karnali have in recent years been connected to the roads; however, these roads are unreliable as monsoon-related natural disasters often make them impassable, especially during the apple harvest season. Last year, Dolpa district produced 3,696 tonnes of apples, but only 50 tonnes reached the lowland markets. Simikot, in the same year, harvested 4,224 tonnes, but none could be taken to other places due to transportation failures. The situation in Simikot is no better this year, as vehicles have not plied these roads for over three months. Poor roads are victimising the farmers in many ways. While the fruit is sold at Rs250 per kg in Kathmandu, farmers in Karnali’s Jubetha, for instance, get a meagre Rs45 for the same quantity. When the roads close, the price of transporting apples to lowland markets in Nepal rockets, further squeezing the farmers who are already at a disadvantage. Then come middlemen and traders, who reap the benefits of the farmers’ haplessness, charging extra to transport the apples. Seeing the fruits of their labour rot, some farmers resort to traditional store methods but still lose half of their produce. Others rely on air transport and mules, often resulting in more loss than profit.Hundreds of families have invested their time, money and labour in commercial apple farming, which has enhanced the reputation of Nepal’s apples abroad. They deserve more state support. There is an urgent need to improve farmers’ access to logistics, including bigger-storage facilities and efficient packaging methods, in the Karnali Province in particular. It is as important to expand the scope of subsidies in transport and storage. Given the recurring road blockages on the Nepali side of the border, exploring alternative nearby markets in Tibet could also be an option. Moreover, apples can be turned into value-added products to prevent waste, extend their shelf life and sell them in local and international markets. Farmers can be trained to ferment apples to make juice and local apple raksi (apple brandy). Many farmers also air-dry or sun-dry apples to increase their shelf life. These alternative products could open up new markets and prevent waste and loss.But above all, authorities should prioritise building disaster-resilient roads and routine maintenance to ensure year-round operation of vehicles. In regions like Karnali, it was new road access that encouraged more and more farmers to invest in apple farming. Now these same farmers feel cheated. Reliable roads won’t just boost the export of this highly-priced commodity. More importantly, they will safeguard the livelihood of thousands of families.  \nLimiting the analysis to the world of print, social scientific academic outputs are mainly put out as articles in journals or edited volumes and also in the form of monographs. Such outputs communicate the analyses of researchers to their peers and other members of the interested public. In this piece, my focus is on edited volumes, which have been an integral part of how scholarship has been developed by academics elsewhere. Having produced quite a few such volumes over the past 25 years and having commissioned some titles of this nature recently, I am convinced that edited volumes do advance branches of Nepal Studies. Hence they deserve close scrutiny that is often missing in our intellectual landscape.Let us start with some basics. Edited volumes come in two primary modes. First is the case when all or most of the articles contained therein have been specially commissioned for it and processed through various stages of the pre-press editorial work. Second is when all or most of the articles have been previously published and they are later brought together in an edited volume known as a ‘Reader’ in the publication industry.Irrespective of its type, the more useful edited volume is put together to attain thematic coherence among the selected articles. Such a volume usually contains a substantial introduction by the editors that locates the book in the proper academic contexts, provides summaries of the chapters contained and also delimits the scope of the collection. The introduction helps the readers to get a good overview of the relevant academic landscape of which the book is a part. It also helps to clarify the remit of the edited collection since no one book can cover all aspects of the theme in question. In a coherent volume, the editors also add references to other articles contained in it by indicating as much in the main text or the footnotes of the original chapters. This makes the chapters in the collection “talk” to each other. A user-friendly edited volume often comes with a decent index. Volumes with new articlesWith respect to edited books of academic writings, it was only in the 1970s that this genre really began to make a mark in the Nepali social science landscape. Some of the early such volumes were derived from papers presented at specific conferences. Among the books that have been important to me, I would mention Social Science in Nepal (1974) edited by historian Prayag Raj Sharma and published by the then Institute of Nepal and Asian Studies of Tribhuvan University. This volume contains a set of foundational reflections on the state of various social science disciplines in Nepal as presented in a seminar in 1973. It set a benchmark for later similar exercises.Edited volumes derived from seminars took off in the 1990s when many university departments and academic NGOs found the seminar-to-book publication route relatively easy to travel. While seminar conveners urged paper presenters to revise their written texts based on the feedback received from participants, the authors of such papers rarely received written comments from their peers who had gone through their texts carefully. Hence, the articles in these edited volumes suffered from the lack of careful peer-reviews and rigorous re-writing and were generally of modest quality. However, there were some exceptions. Edited volumes in which the chapters were critically reviewed by peer readers and the contributors managed to do several rounds of revisions of their texts have done well. For instance, Nepalko Sandarvhama Samajshastriya Chintan (2004) which I co-edited has sold more than 3000 copies. There are several other more recent examples of this type. The readers Readers are collections of mostly already published theme- or period-specific articles by different authors selected by the editors. In the literary field, readers are usually called anthologies. Such books are useful to introduce new students to the research landscape on the subject under consideration. They can also help to instigate new domains of research. Recently, I co-edited (with Lokranjan Parajuli and Mark Liechty) a reader, Nepal in the Long 1950s. In it we “aim to situate the events of that turbulent decade within larger frames both in terms of time—the complex historical processes that led to the transitions of the 1950s and continued thereafter—and space—the complex regional and global contexts in which events in Nepal took place.” It is for the readers to decide how successful the 10 articles (7 reprints, 3 new) in this volume are in terms of fulfilling that aim. We also hope that the volume will instigate younger historians of Nepal to move away decisively from narrowly conceived political histories of the 1950s. When it comes to the readers, the biggest challenge is to get reprint rights for the articles selected by the editors. For articles that have appeared in journals published in Nepal or in Nepal-related area studies journals published from elsewhere, getting such permission is relatively easy. However, getting reprint rights for articles that appeared in disciplinary journals published by big commercial and academic publishers can be difficult. While seeking reprint rights for articles originally selected for two readers (focused on the ongoing federal transition) published by Martin Chautari in the past two years, one such publisher wanted to charge as much as $680 for a single article. That article and others for which we did not get permission were not included in the published readers. In some other cases, we never heard back from the original publishers after seeking reprinting permission following their online guidelines.The missing volumesMany edited volumes on a wide variety of subjects need to be brought into existence by those who study those themes. Take, for example, the case of long-distance labour. While the income remitted back to Nepal by such labourers is crucial to the country’s economy, it is surprising that there isn’t a single reader covering various aspects of this phenomenon. The best academic writings on Nepali mobilities remain scattered in the pages of various hard-to-access journals. Talking about my discipline of history, Nepal’s historians have been particularly missing in publishing thematic edited volumes (a senior historian once dismissed such volumes saying “they don’t count”). Where is the edited volume on Nepal during the long 19th century? Where is the edited volume that covers the history of the changing gender dynamics in Nepali society during the 20th century? Our historians have been prolific in producing single-author monographs, but the absence of edited volumes explains in part why history as a discipline has been a loser when it comes to generating collective disciplinary outcomes and to being perceived as a “useless” discipline. It is high time that my fellow historians and other academics put out new edited volumes and readers on the themes that concern them intellectually.  \nIn my previous articles, I explored the perspectives of chief ministers from all seven provinces during programmes organised by the 'Federalism and Localisation Centre' in provincial capitals. While those pieces focused on federalism's progress and challenges from the current leaders' views, this article broadens the discussion by incorporating insights from former Chief Ministers—Dormani Paudel (Bagmati Province), Raj Kumar Sharma (Karnali Province), Rajendra Rawal and Dirga Sodari (Sudurpaschim Province)—as well as political party leaders, provincial speakers and other key stakeholders. Their collective experiences offer deeper insights into the structural issues, power dynamics and opportunities within Nepal's federal system. This piece examines the complexities of devolving authority to the provinces and identifies the key challenges that must be addressed to seize their full potential.Nepal's 2015 Constitution established a framework for decentralising power to provincial and local governments. However, its implementation has been marked by significant challenges. A major issue is the unclear division of powers between the federal, provincial and local levels. While the Constitution provides provinces with substantial authority, provincial leaders often express frustration over ambiguities in their responsibilities. This lack of clarity leads to administrative delays, governance inefficiencies and legal overlaps. For example, provincial land and forest management laws often mirror federal regulations, creating unnecessary duplication. To overcome this, laws should be aligned across all levels of government and provide clear guidelines on the separation of powers. Additionally, empowering provinces to tailor laws to their specific contexts is critical to enhancing their ability to govern effectively without interference from federal authorities.A significant challenge for provinces is their fiscal dependence on the federal government. The fiscal purse framework has created imbalances, with provinces heavily reliant on federal transfers to fund their budgets. Fiscal equalisation grants, intended to reduce disparities between provinces, are often uneven, leaving some provinces underfunded and unable to execute their development plans. Moreover, these transfers are frequently tied to federal priorities, limiting provincial autonomy. Delays in disbursements and bureaucratic hurdles further exacerbate these challenges. To address this, the fiscal transfer system should be reformed to ensure a more transparent and equitable distribution of resources. Provinces also need to develop internal revenue-generating capacities, enabling them to reduce dependence on federal transfers and invest in key areas like infrastructure, education and healthcare.Fiscal imbalances have also deepened inequalities between provinces. Wealthier provinces receive more resources, while less developed provinces struggle to meet even basic needs. The uneven distribution of grants and transfer delays hinder provinces from planning and implementing long-term development projects. The fiscal transfer system must be transparent, timely, and fair to rectify this. Equitable resource allocation will empower provinces to address their unique needs. This will help reduce provincial disparities and promote balanced development across the country.Another challenge is the limited authority provinces have over key sectors. Provincial governments are constitutionally empowered to manage areas like forestry, yet district forest officers still report to the federal government, restricting provincial control over natural resources. Similarly, delays in transferring police responsibilities to provincial governments have hampered their autonomy in maintaining law and order. Strengthening provincial authority in these areas is essential to ensure effective governance under the federal system.Political instability remains a recurring issue, weakening provincial governance. Frequent leadership changes, political interference and a lack of continuity in administration disrupt policy implementation and delay development projects. One solution to this instability could be the direct election of chief ministers, which would increase accountability and provide more stable leadership. Direct elections would also grant provincial leaders greater legitimacy, reducing the likelihood of frequent leadership changes. Additionally, extending proportional representation to the executive branch could promote inclusivity, ensuring that provincial governments reflect the diversity of the population.Bureaucratic inefficiencies further complicate provincial governance. Currently, provincial secretaries are posted for short one-year terms, which limits their ability to address local concerns effectively. Extending their tenure to at least two years would allow for more consistent administration and better policy implementation. Another issue is the reliance on federal employees temporarily assigned to provincial roles. These officials often lack the long-term commitment needed to address provincial issues effectively. Reforming the bureaucratic system to attract skilled professionals to provincial administrations is key to enhancing provincial governance.Infrastructure development remains a critical area where provinces, especially remote regions like Karnali, have fallen short. Despite their mandate to spearhead infrastructure projects, provincial governments face logistical constraints, financial shortages and political interference. Delays in procurement processes and restrictions on natural resource extraction have significantly hindered infrastructure development. Provinces must prioritise transformative projects and work closely with federal authorities to overcome these challenges. Streamlining procurement processes and addressing federal restrictions will enable provinces to accelerate infrastructure development, driving economic growth and improving access to services.Effective federal, provincial and local coordination is another area requiring urgent attention. While platforms like the Inter-Provincial Council and National Coordination Council exist to facilitate intergovernmental relations, these bodies meet infrequently and often fail to implement decisions. This lack of communication leads to inefficiencies, with provinces and local governments working in silos. Improving coordination and ensuring regular engagement between government tiers is essential for the smooth functioning of the federal system and for aligning provincial development plans with national priorities.Public-private partnerships (PPPs) allow provinces to enhance economic development, particularly in agroforestry, tourism and local product commercialisation. Provinces such as Karnali, which have vast potential in these areas, could benefit significantly from increased collaboration with the private sector. By fostering PPPs, provincial governments can attract investment, create jobs, and promote sustainable economic growth. Cross-border cooperation with neighbouring countries like India and China also holds immense potential for expanding trade and developing infrastructure, further boosting provincial economies.Finally, effective budget formulation and execution are critical for provincial governments to address local development priorities. Provincial assemblies should be more active in budgeting, ensuring that resources are allocated based on each province's specific needs. Nepal could draw inspiration from international examples, such as California’s Legislative Analyst’s Office and the US Congressional Budget Office, which provide direction and ensure that budgets align with provincial priorities. Strengthening provincial authority, fostering better coordination and ensuring equitable resource distribution will enable provinces to play a more effective role in national development, ultimately leading to a more prosperous and inclusive Nepal. \nThe episode of Bhatbhateni supermarket chain owner Min Bahadur Gurung providing land and announcing plans to build the head office of the ruling CPN-UML is dubious on multiple fronts. More than anything else, it has again exposed how Nepal’s politicians, political parties and businesspeople work in collusion for mutual benefit. There is nothing inherently wrong with politicians and businesspersons cooperating, for instance to create a business- and investment-friendly climate. But any initiative the government or the country’s major political parties take should be in the interest of the society, and not unduly favour any particular group or person. But what we see is that most collaborations between politicians and businessmen in Nepal invariably benefit vested interests. The deal between CPN-UML chair KP Sharma Oli and Bhatbhateni Supermarket owner has raised various questions. First, the way the party central secretariat took the decision looks suspicious. Though Oli convened a meeting to get the proposal endorsed by the party committee, even the party’s office bearers were reportedly kept in dark about the details and exact plans. Oli is not only the chief of a major political force but also the country’s prime minister. Even a layman can easily infer that Gurung, the businessman, didn’t make such a huge investment out of generosity. Another concerning thing about the Oli-Gurung deal is that the prime minister openly accepted the huge donation—10 ropani and 14 ana (0.55 hectares) of land and an investment to build a highly sophisticated building—from a person who is facing multiple corruption charges and whose cases are sub judice in the court. This is tantamount to openly promoting corruption and bad governance. Oli’s action has been criticised even in the UML party. Some leaders including standing committee member Binda Pandey have publicly criticised the deal and have demanded that the party correct it. They have admirably mustered courage to speak against the wrong of Oli, the party’s all-powerful chair, even when they know that he tends to take such criticism personally. If the past is any guide, such critics of Oli tend to be systematically sidelined in the party. This is not a one-off act by the chief of a major political party. It is an open secret that major parties give election tickets to businesspersons in return for financial help of various kinds. There is one thing common between Sher Bahadur Deuba of Nepali Congress, UML’s Oli and Pushpa Kamal Dahal of the CPN (Maoist Centre): all of them have over the years sought the help of controversial businessmen to prop up their parties or even their own factions within the parties. Oli is yet to offer a convincing reason for why accepting the donation was right. The occupant of the highest office in the land cannot act with such abandon, with seemingly no sense of accountability towards the people, or even towards his own party cadres. Oli has always been known as someone who is headstrong and not afraid even to shield goons if it serves his interest. He hasn’t changed much. Meanwhile, the public’s delusion with the old political establishment continues to grow.     \nIn February 2020, Nasreen and her husband Tofik were living in Shiv Vihar, an upcoming neighbourhood in northeast New Delhi. But that month, riots erupted targeting Muslims like them and Tofik was pushed by a mob from the second floor of the building where they lived, according to a police report he filed days later from hospital.He survived, but has a permanent limp and was only able to return to work selling clothes on the street after spending nearly 3 years recuperating.Soon after the riots the couple moved to Loni, a more remote area with poorer infrastructure and job prospects - but with a sizable Muslim population.“I will not go back to that area. I feel safer among Muslims,” Tofik, who like his wife goes by one name, told Reuters.Reuters interviewed about two dozen people, who described how Muslims in the Indian capital have been congregating in enclaves away from the nation’s Hindu majority, seeking safety in numbers following the deadly 2020 riot and an increase in anti-Muslim hate speech. Details about this phenomenon, which has led a major Muslim neighbourhood in Delhi to effectively run out of space, have not previously been reported.There is no official data on segregation in India, whose long-delayed census also means that there are few reliable figures on how much Muslim enclaves have grown in the past decade. Muslims comprise about 14% of India’s 1.4 billion people.Ground zero in Delhi is the central neighbourhood of Jamia Nagar, which has long been a temporary sanctuary for Muslims when communal riots break out.With ever more Muslims flocking in, the neighbourhood is overflowing, despite a boom in construction, according to 10 local leaders, including politicians, activists and clergy, as well as five real-estate agents.“No matter how brave a Muslim might be, they feel they have to move because if a mob comes, how brave can you really be?” said Raes Khan, a real estate agent in South Delhi who said Muslim clients now almost exclusively demand homes in Muslim-majority areas like Jamia Nagar.Segregation nationally has increased significantly in the past decade, said London School of Economics political anthropologist Raphael Susewind, who has overseen long-term field-work on India’s Muslim population.Rising Islamophobia under Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which came into power in 2014, is a “key driver” of the trend, he said.Six Muslim community leaders said significant anecdotal evidence supported Susewind’s assertion that segregation has increased. Jamia Nagar clergyman Md Sahil said the number of attendees at his mosque’s early morning prayers had more than doubled to over 450 in the past four to five years, and that it reflected the overall rise in population there.In response to Reuters’ questions, Jamal Siddiqui, a senior BJP official for minority affairs, suggested that poorer Muslims might choose to live in segregated areas because such neighbourhoods tend to be more affordable. “Educated Muslims leave the area and settle in developed areas with mixed population,” he said.However, Syed Sayeed Hasan, a Congress party worker in Jamia Nagar, said a big push factor for sectarian cloistering in Delhi was the 2020 riot. More than 200 were injured and at least 53 people, mostly Muslim, were killed in protests after Modi’s Hindu nationalist government moved to introduce a law that made it easier for many non-Muslims to become citizens.A 2020 Delhi government report blamed the riots on BJP leaders who made speeches that called for violence against protesters. At the time, the party said the allegations were baseless and that law enforcement had said there was no proof one of the leaders blamed in the report was responsible.The Delhi government, controlled by the opposition Aam Aadmi Party, did not respond to requests for comment. RISE IN HATE SPEECHIndia’s National Crime Records Bureau, a government agency that collects and analyses crime data, doesn’t keep records on targeted violence against communities.It said the average number of annual riots with communal origins had fallen about 9% between 2014 and 2022 as compared to the previous nine years, when the Congress party ran India.But independent experts, at the Center for the Study of Organized Hate, a Washington-based think-tank, have documented a significant increase in anti-Muslim hate speech, from 255 incidents in first half of 2023 to 413 in the second half of 2023. BJP politicians and affiliate groups were key to the trend, the think-tank said.Reuters has previously reported about how right-wing “cow vigilantes,” some of whom have ties to the BJP, have led lynch mobs against Muslims.Modi, while campaigning in April for a third term as premier, attacked Muslims as “infiltrators” who had “more children,” implying they were a threat to India’s Hindu majority.The BJP’s Siddiqui added that Modi was referring to undocumented immigrants like Rohingya Muslims whom he alleged “are living in India and are also weakening India.”When previously asked about alleged anti-Muslim bias, the BJP government has said it does not discriminate and that many of its anti-poverty programs have benefited Muslims, who are among the poorest groups in India.The BJP could only form a fragile coalition government after national election results were announced in June. In the immediate aftermath, at least eight anti-Muslim lynching incidents were reported, the non-governmental Association for Protection of Civil Rights said on July 5.SAFETY IN NUMBERSJamia Nagar is a bustling cluster of alleyways behind Jamia Millia Islamia, a Muslim university that was an epicentre of the 2020 protests. It anchors an area of southeast Delhi that has many Muslim neighbourhoods and a population of about 150,000, according to state election data.When Reuters visited the cramped alleyways of the enclave on a sweltering summer day, they were framed by five-storey buildings. Developers had added three storeys to what were many two storey buildings to cater to the increase in demand, two real estate agents said. In a sign of booming growth, there were also dozens of newly-built kindergartens set up in the narrow lanes of the area.Most Muslim enclaves are not as well-developed. A 2023 study, from British, American and Indian economists that analysed 1.5 million Indian areas found that public services like water and schools were comparatively rare in neighbourhoods popular with Muslims and that children in such areas often face educational disadvantages.After Tofik and Nasreen moved to Loni following Tofik’s assault, their income halved, with Tofik only able to work reduced hours.Nasreen’s 16-year-old daughter, Muskan, suffered. The school in the outskirts of Delhi was under-resourced, Muskan said, and she missed her classmates. After feeling that the new school wasn’t for her, she dropped out.But Nasreen doesn’t regret the move. “I will never go back. I have lost faith in them,” she said, of the neighbours who she said formed part of the mob that pushed her husband.Reuters could not independently verify her claim but Sam Sundar, a 44-year-old Hindu resident of Nasreen’s old neighbourhood, said both Hindus and Muslims suffered during the riots, which he blamed on outside perpetrators.But he acknowledged that Muslims bore the brunt: “Very few Muslims now live in the area. This is not a good thing.”Nasreen’s neighbour Malika also moved to the outskirts after her husband was killed in the 2020 riots. But she was unable to find a job and now also lives part-time at a small room in another neighbourhood with more Hindu residents, where she is close to construction sites where she does odd jobs.“Here I am afflicted with poverty, there I’m afflicted with insecurity,” she said.Enclaves have also drawn upper middle class Muslim families, who used to be more comfortable living in mixed areas, said Raes, the real-estate agent.“People feel it is better to live in separate areas rather than having a constant threat to life and property from members of the other community,” said Mujaheed Nafees, a Muslim leader from Modi's home state of Gujarat, which hosts India’s largest Muslim enclave of some 400,000. \nToday the weather is forecast to be partly to generally cloudy in the hilly areas and partly cloudy to mainly fair in the rest of the country. Light rain with thunder and lightning is likely to occur at a few places of the hilly region of Koshi, Bagmati and Gandaki Province and at one or two places of the hilly region of the rest of the country.Tonight the weather is forecast to be partly to generally cloudy in the hilly areas of Koshi Province, Bagmati Province and Gandaki Province and partly cloudy to mainly fair in the rest of the country. Light rain with thunder and lightning is likely to occur at one or two places of the hilly region of Koshi, Bagmati and Gandaki Province.According to the meteorological forecasting division analysis, the country is currently experiencing a partial influence of western winds, along with some influence of the local wind effects in the hilly areas of Koshi, Bagmati, and Gandaki provinces.On Thursday Janakpur experienced the highest temperature of 34°C and Jomsom experienced the lowest temperature of 9.5°C. Pokhara received the maximum rainfall of 51.2 mm of rainfall in the last 24 hours. \nFive-time champions India launched their SAFF Women’s Championship campaign with a 5-2 victory over Pakistan at the Dasharath Stadium in Kathmandu on Thursday.Grace Dangmei scored a brace for India, while Manisha Kalyan, Bala Devi Ngangom and Jyoti Chouhan were also on target.Suha Hirani and Kayla Siddiqi scored for Pakistan.India, who are looking to reclaim the SAFF throne after losing it to Bangladesh in 2022, made their intent clear with a powerful display.India took the lead in the 5th minute through Dangmei, who received a low cross from Ranjana Chanu at the edge of the area and rocketed a powerful shot into the back of the net.Kalyan doubled India’s lead in the 17th minute with a superb finish after running into a through pass from Bala Devi.Bala Devi then added India’s third in the 35th minute, smashing an indirect freekick into the top corner.Grace added her individual second seven minutes later with a tight-angled half-volley after Pakistan’s backline failed to clear a cross from Chanu.Pakistan went into the break reducing the deficit to 4-1 from a penalty kick, which was awarded to them after Ashalata Devi brought down Nadia Khan inside the box in the first half injury time. Hirani stepped up and gave India goalkeeper Elangbam Panthoi no chance.The Pakistani were a completely different side after the break and reduced India’s advantage quickly after the restart when Siddiqi found Rameen Fareed’s deflected attempt just outside the six yard box and sent it into the bottom corner.The second goal instilled a sense of an improbable fightback into Pakistan and went close to scoring twice after the hour mark, with Zahmena Malik finding an open chance from close range in the 60th and Amina reaching close to scoring from open play four minutes later. But Pakistan lacked clinical touch and missed both opportunities.Chouhan then punished Pakistan adding their winning goal in the 78th heading in a corner from Dalima Chhibber.India play Bangladesh in their next Group A game on Wednesday.

During the hearing on Thursday, a bench comprising Justices Kumar Regmi and Kumar Chudal directed Ghimire to file a written response within the stipulated time frame.“If there are any grounds for not issuing the order as requested by the petitioner, provide evidence along with a response in writing either personally or through a legal representative within seven days from the date of receiving this notice, in addition to submitting a copy of the petition,” the apex court said.On September 27, the Judicial Council nominated two high court chief judges as Supreme Court justices despite lawyers’ sit-in on the council premises, protesting against the nominations. Ghimire, the NBA president, had criticised the nominations, accusing the council of selecting the two judges in exchange for money.Deputy Registrar Ghimire filed the petition at the court on September 30 demanding legal action against the NBA president. \nTop leaders of Nepal’s three major political parties have agreed to expedite the formation of a search committee to recommend candidates for the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) and the Commission of Investigation on Enforced Disappeared Persons as soon as possible. During a meeting held at the Prime Minister’s residence in Baluwatar, Kathmandu on Thursday, the leaders decided to fast-track the remaining tasks of the peace process.Leaders from the CPN-UML, Nepali Congress and Maoist Centre agreed to form the search committee responsible for selecting officials for the commissions, said Shakti Basnet, a leader from the Maoist Centre. The committee is expected to be finalised at the next Cabinet meeting, scheduled for Friday.“The Cabinet will decide the members of the search committee in its upcoming meeting, accelerating the formation of both the TRC and the Commission of Investigation on Enforced Disappeared Persons,” a source from Baluwatar stated.Earlier in April, the government had formed a five-member committee led by Om Prakash Mishra, a former Chief Justice, to nominate the candidates for both the commissions but it could not do so after the National Human Rights Commission refused to send its representative in the search committee saying that it needs a time-bound commitment from the government to endorse a bill to amend the Enforced Disappearance Enquiry, Truth and Reconciliation Commission Act.Other members of the search committee led by Mishra were former Supreme Court judge Jagadish Sharma Poudel, former ambassador Arjun Karki and human rights activist Stella Tamang and representative of the national human rights commission.“We will recommend the qualified people in the commission so that both the commissions could carry forward the spirit of the peace process, legal procedure and can reach out to all stakeholders and suggest and resolve the issues,” Basnet said. “The search committee will recommend the names for both commissions.”Sources said that former chief justice Mishra will lead the search committee this time as well but the remaining four members besides representation from the National Human Rights Commission will be changed. The search committee was formed as per the Supreme Court’s March 12 order to the government to select office bearers for the two commissions within a month.The court had asked the government to constitute task forces within the commissions to conduct preliminary investigations into the victims’ complaints until the office bearers were appointed.According to the two newly revised Acts related to the truth and reconciliation process, the recommendation committee shall be given two months to make nominations for the chairpersons and members of the two commissions.Prime Minister and CPN-UML Chairman KP Sharma Oli, Nepali Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba and Maoist Centre Chairman Pushpa Kamal Dahal were present at Thursday’s meeting. Other leaders in attendance included Home Minister Ramesh Lekhak, Maoist Centre leader Basnet and Attorney General Ramesh Badal.Basnet added that the meeting agreed to finalise the search committee, which had been initiated during the tenure of his party’s chair Dahal as prime minister.“The meeting to expedite the remaining tasks of the peace process follows the decision made during Maoist Centre chair Dahal’s premiership,” Basnet said. “The parties had agreed to form a search committee to select candidates for the Truth and Reconciliation Commission and the Commission of Investigation on Enforced Disappeared Persons.”Earlier too, the government had formed two commissions to look into the case of truth and reconciliation process and inquiry into disappearances but they failed to achieve the goal. The Truth Commission has received 63,718 complaints, while the commission on disappearances is sitting on around 2,400 cases. The new teams will have four years to accomplish their tasks, though there are provisions for their extension. The commissions that were formed in 2015 have done nothing other than collect complaints and conduct preliminary investigations on some of them.Previously, the government passed a bill related to transitional justice, which was ratified by the President on August 29. The House of Representatives passed the bill on August 14, followed by its approval by the National Assembly on August 22. The two commissions have been paralysed since July 2022 after the government decided to extend their terms without retaining their chairmen and members. \nAmid widespread deaths and devastation caused by monsoon across various districts, Nepal is at a heightened risk for water-borne, vector-borne, and air-borne disease outbreaks.With most water sources contaminated by rain and floodwater, and thousands of displaced people living in makeshift shelters, experts have warned of a potential surge in infections in the coming days.“People are already getting infected with water-borne, vector-borne and air-borne diseases,” said Dr Sher Bahadur Pun, chief of the Clinical Research Unit at Sukraraj Tropical and Infectious Disease Hospital. “These problems could worsen in the coming days.” At least 209 people have been confirmed dead, while 29 others are still missing due to the floods and landslides triggered by record-breaking torrential rainfall that started Thursday evening. Additionally, 142 people have sustained various degrees of injury, and more than 4,222 others have been taken to safe places, the Home Ministry said on Monday evening. Doctors warn that the risk of water-borne, vector-borne and air-borne disease outbreaks increases in the aftermath of disasters. Nepal’s past experiences suggest the same.“People are already contracting cholera and other water-borne diseases,” said Dr Pun. “As displaced people mostly live in temporary shelters, the chances of spread of air-borne and vector-borne diseases remain high.”At least 95 people from various districts, including from Kathmandu and Lalitpur, have tested positive for cholera since the start of the monsoon in June. The Vibrio cholera 01 Ogawa serotype has been confirmed in the stool samples of the infected patients. Thousands of others were also infected with diarrheal infections after the start of the monsoon season. Diarrhoeal disease is a common and seasonal public health issue, usually triggered by unsafe food and water or hygiene issues. Likewise, six people died, and 12,644 others were hospitalised this year due to dengue, which has spread to 76 out of 77 districts across the country. Hundreds of people are contracting seasonal flu, but health authorities have no records of these cases.Officials at the Ministry of Health and Population said that they are bracing for tough days ahead, as the floodwaters not only contaminate drinking water sources but also create breeding grounds for various disease-spreading vectors.“We expect a surge in water-borne, vector-borne and air-borne diseases in the coming days, as it takes a few days for these illnesses to incubate,” said Dr Yadu Chandra Ghimire, director at the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division. “We have alerted all agencies concerned to step up vigilance and prepare to deal with any adverse situations.”Public health experts have warned that healthcare facilities in the disaster-hit districts could witness an uptick in cases of viral fever cases and waterborne diseases—diarrhoea, dysentery, food poisoning—and snakebites.Health Ministry officials say that they are aware of the risks and have directed agencies concerned to prepare accordingly.“We have stockpiled essential medicines in districts, provinces and at the central level,” said Dr Roshan Pokhrel, the secretary at the ministry. “Responding to the looming outbreaks is not only the responsibility of the Health Ministry, but also of other ministries and agencies, and we have been coordinating with them as well.”In addition to stepping up surveillance measures, stockpiling medicines, and deploying medics at the health facilities in disaster-hit areas, public health experts emphasise the importance of health awareness in reducing infections.They say a combination of careful surveys, ensuring safe drinking water, maintaining hygiene and sanitation, social mobilisation and treatment are required to contain the possible outbreaks of various ailments.The monsoon in Nepal is itself a season of epidemics with thousands of people across the country getting infected with water-borne and vector-borne diseases.The country is one of the world’s most vulnerable to the climate crisis and has witnessed extreme weather events over the past decade and a half.Evidence suggests that the maximum temperature in Nepal is rising at a greater rate (0.056 degrees Celsius per year) than the global average of 0.03 degrees Celsius per year.Experts say extreme weather events—excess rainfall in a short period, continuous rains for several days after the monsoon, dry spells, droughts, below-average precipitation, and above-normal winter temperatures—have become more frequent in Nepal.In recent years, scientists have gathered credible evidence linking the climate crisis to adverse health effects that impact the quality of life and kill people. \nAs the festive season approaches, prices of daily essentials like rice, edible oil, legumes, and lentils have increased.Retailers say food prices are expected to stay high throughout Dashain and Tihar, Nepal’s biggest festivals.In Nepal, food prices are heavily influenced by the Indian market. Even though prices have not increased in India, some opportunist traders have been taking advantage of the poor market monitoring to increase prices under different pretexts. For example, on September 14, India raised the basic import tax on crude and refined edible oils by 20 percent. Nepali importers seized this opportunity to hike their prices even though Nepal had not raised the import tax.Dhurba Prasad Adhikari, joint treasurer of the Nepal Retailers Association, said Nepali wholesalers and retailers have already raised the prices. “It has been a week since edible oil price was increased by Rs20 per litre and the price is expected to increase further as the festive demand kicks in,” he said. But he admits that market rumours and weak inspections make prices more unstable, especially during the festive season when demand is at its peak.According to the association, sunflower oil prices have increased from Rs190 to Rs210 per litre. Likewise, the per litre price of mustard oil has gone up from Rs350 to Rs370.Adhikari, who operates Adhikari Khadya Store, said the price of edible oil is expected to increase in Tihar due to high demand.Retailers said strict inspections in large trading houses could help stabilise prices during the festive season. Consumer rights activists say the current government inspections of the market are just for show and will not address issues related to price, quality, and quantity.“The government’s market inspection body is looking only at retail markets. They, too, know this will not change prices unless they also inspect the warehouses of large importers and traders,” Adhikari said. He said that the government inspecting body needs to check on the stock of goods held by traders.According to retailers, even with the new rice harvesting beginning soon, prices of the staple have increased by Rs100 kg for a 25 kg bag.Even the price of sona mansuli, which normally remains at Rs60 per kg, has now inched up to Rs70 to Rs75 per kg.Rice prices, however, are expected to decline after the arrival of the new harvest.Sugar is now being sold at Rs120 per kg and expected to rise further, retailers said.As private sector traders say they are out of sugar stock and both state supply utilities—the Salt Trading Corporation and the Food Management and Trading Company—have delayed opening the tender to import the sweetener, according to market insiders, the price is expected to cross Rs160 per kg by Tihar.However, retailers said the jeera (cumin seed) price has declined. But the price could still go up in the next two weeks.Last year during Dashain, the price of jeera, an indispensable spice, spiked from Rs1,400 to Rs1,500 per kg. The price has declined, and it is being transacted around Rs950 per kg this year, Adhikari said. Prices of lentils and legumes tend to fluctuate based on international production, but have remained high in recent months.According to the association, pulses have reached Rs180 per kg from Rs175 per kg.Adhikari said food prices have been increasing every year. “The rice prices are so high that people are buying only what they need in smaller quantities,” said Adhikari.“The government needs to intervene in the market, particularly inspect the large traders engaged in unscrupulous market activities,” said Prem Lal Maharjan, president of the National Consumer Forum. “Proper inspection will help bring the prices down. It will also help the government bring in more revenues,” he said.As the government has started operating fair-price shops across the country, there might be some relief for consumers, Maharjan said. “But such subsidised shops should be operated year-round to control market prices.”    \nDean Richard Thompson recently completed his two years as the American ambassador to Nepal. Arriving here just before the 2022 elections, he has since closely observed Nepali politics and society. Umesh Chauhan and Biswas Baral recently sat down with Thompson to reflect on his time in Nepal, major US projects in the country including those under the MCC, geopolitical competition with China, trade, and a range of other issues.How have you seen Nepali politics evolve in the two years you have been in the country? What events stood out? I’ve seen a lot of Nepali politics. Obviously, there’s been a lot of changes. I got here right before the national elections in November 2022. It was really great to see the democratic process play out here, to see Nepalis turn out in such great numbers and make their choices known.Democracy is such a vibrant and colourful exercise anywhere in the world. Nepal did not disappoint on that front. It's been fascinating to watch it evolve, to watch the governments come in different formations.What’s been great is the commitment we’ve seen from successive groups in government to moving forward and carrying forward the [bilateral] partnership and building on projects. I’ve also been amazed at some of the innovative things happening in various sectors of the economy.There has been some very exciting work in the IT sector, for example, that runs the gamut from more traditional back-office type operations to cutting-edge AI research, to developing educational apps for school students, to things like what we have been sponsoring at our Content Creator’s Mela these past two years. It is great to see Nepalis show lots of creativity in expressing themselves and talking about their culture and their society in so many different ways. Across the board, I’d say the experience has been unique.How have the Nepal-US relations evolved over the past 77 years of diplomatic ties? What are the salient features of the relationship? What I would say is we’ve always tried to listen, to engage with the Nepali society. Based on that, I think one of the things that we’ve done is refine the range of products.The Peace Corps, the USAID, the Millennium Challenge Corporation, the Development Finance Corporation, or other elements of our assistance and development commitments—these are different tools that can be employed. And Nepal has continually expanded its capacity to take advantage of them. The US has been able to increase the number of tools and assets, if you will, that Nepal can use to build its economy.I’m very proud of the fact that we have done this primarily through grant-based assistance, so that there is little in terms of downsides. At the same time, we have focused on different segments of the economy or society, for example, through the Development Finance Corporation, we’re now able to target and work with the financial sector to create more opportunities for small and medium-sized enterprises, particularly women-run enterprises. Through the USAID, we can use more of the traditional mechanisms of assistance.The Millennium Challenge Corporation kind of speaks for itself. It targets large-scale, massive infrastructure type projects that aim to be transformative in terms of Nepal’s economy. It has helped grow the road and infrastructure network and show new technology that can help expand that network and make roads safer, more reliable, and easier to maintain. It has helped build an electricity infrastructure that allows Nepal, first and foremost, to internally use the green hydropower that's at its disposal, but there will be excess capacity even to export it to the region to earn additional income. So I’m pretty excited about what I’ve seen happen over the past 77 years, and where we are today. I’m also extremely positive about building on where we are now. Can you give us a status of the implementation of projects under the Millennium Challenge Account Nepal? In the MCC, energy, obviously, is a high-priority area and so is transportation. Where we are with the projects themselves is we have let out the contracts for the sub-stations, for the 18-kilometre cross-border transmission line, and we have reissued the tender for the 297-kilometre broader transmission line package that had to be revised due to some cost changes over the time it took to implement that piece of the package.But we’re pretty positive about getting that back on track by the end of the year and putting the project firmly on the right footing for a five-year completion timeline. But there have also been hurdles, right? Do you still expect the transmission lines and road projects to be completed in five years?I expect there to be more hurdles. The biggest challenge was when the bids came back for the 297-kilometre transmission line. We had a number of delays there from Covid to worldwide inflation, to supply chain shifts that I don’t think people had foreseen completely. I’m not surprised. But the MCC has had a lot of experience around the world with these projects.It builds into this assumption that there will be challenges, there will be situations that need to be rethought and overcome. The real trick is making sure we move forward in a way that’s smart and focused on keeping things on time and on track. We're fortunate in the case of Nepal because we have a partner that has so heavily invested its own resources into the project.We have our $500 million grant and Nepal is putting in almost $200 million. It’s been made a national pride project. Look, other things will inevitably come up. But we believe that we have a good team that’s ready to tackle those types of challenges and press forward.At the end of the day, this can serve as a really positive model for how development assistance and how large-scale infrastructure projects can be implemented in a partnership that is largely the result of an internal domestic process. Don’t forget, Nepal requested the MCC project. The government of Nepal, through a consultative process, developed the idea, designed the project, and is now its lead implementer.We’re a financier and a partner but it is very much a Nepal-owned effort. Talking about challenges, there are many local governments and we have to deal with them every 10 to 15 kilometres in the project areas. Different communities have different concerns and priorities. This can add to some difficulty.What do you think will happen to the project if it cannot meet the five-year deadline?The fate of the project is to be completed in its entirety in five years. I can't speak to whether there’s going to be a particular challenge to delay it by six months or seven months or something like that. Right now, in our planning and projection, we hope that we can move it forward within the timeline.If it needs to go beyond that, we’ll work closely with our partner and figure it out. I’m confident that the $500 million that the US government is providing will be spent within the five years and it will lay a firm foundation for the completion of the project.But coming back to your scenario, indeed, you have different communities. A lot of people are affected by this. Now, on the one hand, that's why we encourage and insist on a consultative process, on everything being as transparent as possible so people know exactly what’s going to happen, that they know what the money is being spent on, what the effects will be in terms of how many trees will have to be cut down or what roads will be built where. That’s very important to us: no surprises for the communities that are out there.I think that we will rely on a lot of that effort to help us propel the project forward if things do get challenging on other fronts as well.Like you said, the project does need to be completed by a deadline of five years. Just in case it doesn’t, what happens?Look, it is an ambitious undertaking. There’s no question about it, right? And the Millennium Challenge Corporation is committed to making it happen within that five-year period. The MCA Nepal is committed to making it happen within that five-year period. But they’re also working closely together to make sure that it’s being done in a proper way, in a transparent way, and I’m confident that we will be able to complete what we need to complete. I’m also sure there’s a firm commitment from the government that if there’s a little piece left over here or there, to make sure it goes forward.I don’t worry about the ultimate completion of the project. I’m more focused on how we get it going as quickly as possible, because just the implementation of the project itself should employ close to 10,000 Nepalis, right? I really want communities to start to see the benefit of the project as soon as possible, because that’s where the transformative nature of it comes into play. Part of it is building it. Part of it is implementing it. Part of it is learning from that process. But then having this infrastructure in place, that’s what really changes the dynamic in Nepal and in the economic well-being of the country.Some fear that a failure to complete the project on time could even create rifts in our bilateral ties.I don’t think they should be fearful. We are partners in this, and if there’s any issue, if we're going to work through it together. What we should be doing is focusing entirely on implementing the project to its fullest potential as quickly as possible.Let’s move to geopolitics. What we see in the region is seemingly an exclusivist India-China geopolitical competition. Indians appear reluctant to work with the regimes that work closely with China. It's almost like they are saying, it's either the Chinese or us. How do you see this geopolitical dynamics playing out in Nepal? And where do the Americans fit in this picture?Yeah, it’s a good question in terms of the dynamic that’s in play today and where things are headed. We have of course been watching the India-China relationship and its development over the past few years with some degree of concern. Obviously, there was conflict there some years ago, and I think they’ve been trying to manage that since.And there’s no question that other countries in the region feel that very powerfully. From our standpoint, what we would like to see is the countries of the region—and particularly Nepal because that’s where I’m accredited and that’s where I have some level of knowledge—exercise their sovereignty and to have the space that they need to make decisions about they own future on behalf of their people in a positive way.We don’t believe countries should be asked to choose. We fully expect that Nepal is going to have good relations with India and China. They’re two neighbours. They’re large countries. They’re important countries in the region. It’s critically important for Nepal that it works with and benefits from both India and China.At the same time, we see no reason that should have any effect on our relationship with Nepal, and no reason Nepal should not be fully able to take full advantage of what the US has to offer. We will continue to watch and continue to work closely with Nepal as a partner and to encourage it to exercise its sovereignty and its decision-making in a way that benefits the Nepali people. The US-China relations are also very dicey at the moment. Surely this has some effect on how the US perceives the Chinese role around the world, including in Nepal.We had a recent high-level visit by our National Security Advisor [to China]. We’ve had recent visits by the Secretary of State, the Secretary of Commerce, the Secretary of Treasury. I think there’s a real effort to try to manage what we all acknowledge is as a competition that’s underway, in a way that’s positive and can maybe move us more towards some type of cooperative element.That channel should continue to be pursued by the US and China, but it’s not reflective of our relationship with Nepal, or our relationship with India. This is about what we can do together [with Nepal]. I’m not going to comment on what other countries may be saying about us, how they may be trying to influence us.I would commit to us remaining as transparent as possible so Nepalis can make their own decisions about what's happening by our relationship.Recently, the Americans were blamed for ousting Sheikh Hasina from Bangladesh. The US is also often accused of meddling in the domestic affairs of other South Asian states, and in other parts of the world for that matter. How do you respond to this accusation?First off, I think you’ve got to take with a grain of salt anything that’s being said by someone who’s been forced to flee their country. The United States simply does not meddle in the internal politics of other countries. We work very hard to be as transparent as we possibly can about our relationships, about what we’re doing, about what we intend.That’s not to say that if we disagree vehemently with a country about a certain policy or a certain issue, we won’t raise it. But this idea that the US would find some benefit in enacting a change in government like that, it simply isn’t part of our repertoire of diplomacy. What we rather look to do is build the strongest relationships that we can.We love to do that primarily through people-to-people relationships and sponsoring as much development opportunity as we possibly can with our partner countries. So, I put no stock in these types of rumours and statements.There is also this sentiment that the Americans and the Indians are increasingly working together on strategic issues, and the same is seen even in South Asia.Certainly, there’s been a huge growth in the strategic partnership between the US and India. I think we want to see that continue to move forward in a positive way. At the same time, there have been disagreements between the US and India on various fronts, just as we have disagreements with many of our partners. And we try to deal with those in a proactive, professional and productive way.But, again, we see our relationship with each individual country through a bilateral lens. So if there are ways that the US and India working together can be beneficial, and another country agrees to such a cooperation, fine. But when it comes to Nepal, we’re going to base our relationship and our efforts first and foremost on our bilateral discussions and our bilateral relationship.Even as we speak, the US and Nepali armies are undertaking joint training in Nepal. How would you characterise the relations between the two armies?Yeah, the PAC ANGEL exercise is going on, focused on disaster relief, humanitarian assistance. The relationship between the two militaries has been strong, it remains strong, and I think it will continue to be strong primarily because we focus it on the areas Nepal wants to focus on—which is building a Nepal army that is capable of responding to disasters, providing humanitarian assistance, and then serving as part of the global peacekeeping network through the United Nations as the largest contributor force of peacekeepers. It’s in our interest to see Nepal continue to professionalise and develop its capacity on those fronts. That’s where our focus is, and that’s where we will continue to make efforts.There has also been a lot of debate in Nepal on the Indo-Pacific Strategy (IPS) and its applicability to South Asia. What is the current state of its application?The Indo-Pacific Strategy is a broad, big strategy by the United States government about how it looks at the entire region. And so it’s about how we create an open, independent, sovereign Indo-Pacific region for the benefit of all the people in the region.What we will continue to do is employ it to build relationships we have with each of the countries in the region. How can we continue to support democratic development? How can we continue to support economic development? Let’s not forget a huge portion, maybe 60 percent of the world’s commerce transits the Indo-Pacific corridor in some way, shape, or form every year.It’s in everyone’s interest for that to remain open and free. And for the countries of the region to be able to act in a sovereign way in their own interests.There is also a sizable section of Nepalis who believe that the IPS was brought with the intent of countering China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), and that Nepal is struggling to find a balance between the two. What is your reading?The USAID, the MCC, the Development Finance Corporation, all of our development programmes have a singular purpose, which is to work with our bilateral partners to grow their economies, to make them more able to meet the needs of their people. That’s the goal. That's how they were designed. And that’s how we will continue to treat them.The BRI is China's initiative. It’s pushing that forward. It’s up to each country to decide how it wants to engage with others. We believe the model of, say, a USAID or an MCC is proving itself to be beneficial to countries, as they are grant-based and economic growth oriented. We’ll continue to push them because we think the data and historical experience we’ve had support them.I think it’s incumbent on us to try to help all of our partners relate to us as equals in any realm that we’re working together. That’s critically important and something we have to acknowledge and something we have to make sure that they’re able to acknowledge.It's about building trust, about showing that our intent is correct, that we have the best interest of our partners in mind, and that we’re applying the same and transparent standards universally.For example, on the MCC, we’ve published everything on the internet. If anybody in Nepal has a question about any aspect of the project, they can go to the website, they can read about the project, they can see the blueprints, they can know exactly what it’s going to involve. That's how I think we build relationships.I think if I came to Nepal and said, hey, I want to do X project because I want to counter this country, I don’t think I would get very good reception. We just don’t look at the world that way. It’s not a healthy approach in the long run.But a bilateral focus that seeks to empower the people of a country—that’s where I think we have the best chance of moving forward. Nepal’s Parliament has finally passed an amendment to the transitional justice law. How does the US see this development? How do you see the transitional justice process progressing?I think this is a really important step in the process. I would say that we remain positive about the way it's going and we are looking to see how we can help. You noted, I’m sure, that we joined a number of other partner countries in issuing a statement of support after the Parliament passed it.We all know bringing a conflict of this scale to conclusion is always going to be a challenge. The TJ legislation has passed, which was a tough hurdle, but implementation will also be difficult.We’re looking forward to figuring out how we can be supportive, and how other partners can be supportive. Some of that may be through bilateral means. Some of it may be through multilateral means.But what I remain encouraged about, in particular, is, we’ve always said this needs to be a Nepali-run process. It has been. That it needs to be victim-centric. I believe that it is. And so we need to make sure the consultative piece of this remains alive as you move to implementation, so that the victims groups, so that the child soldier groups, so that other entities that have been involved continue to have a voice and continue to work together to figure out how to resolve this, to make reparations work, to bring justice in those cases. And so, we are positive.Thousands of Nepali youths are leaving the country every single day in search of better jobs. In this light, do you see the prospect of greater American FDI helping Nepal build a more robust economy that can create enough good jobs?I do. At the beginning of the interview, I talked about some sectors of the economy that are quite exciting right now. I think you’re seeing a lot of interest from the US in the IT sector, the tourism sector, in the health sector, and in the energy sector as it continues to develop.We’re very keen to look for ways to bring more US investment here, whether it’s through equity sort of vehicles, or direct bilateral investments. I think that can also be positive. I think Nepal did a good job in setting up that April Investment Summit. That sent a really positive signal. You’ll recall that we had a representative from the US Chamber of Commerce, Atul Keshap, come out for that. We’ve had a great run of senior US visitors out here over the last year and a half.I think the key right now is for Nepal, through its private sector, through its government, to figure out how to make the environment for investment in Nepal as attractive as it can possibly be. In this interview, we’ve talked about the idea of competition between countries. One place where I will absolutely acknowledge there’s competition is in trying to attract investment.And so Nepal needs to figure out how to make itself as attractive as possible, and how to make it as easy as possible to do business. That helps not only investments that come from other countries, but makes it easier for Nepalis to start businesses, right? It makes it easier for Nepalis to operate and do what they want. And so, in addition to welcoming, say, US companies or British companies or Canadian companies, we would also love to see Nepalis who have gone abroad come back and start to help in building the economy here.We’ve seen how capable and how dynamic they are in building other people’s economies. Let’s do the same here at home.I mentioned that the trade and investment framework talks that we have with Nepal are in their seventh round. I look forward to, in the rest of my tenure here, to continue to build the momentum that will allow investment to take shape and the economy here to thrive. \nHere’s what Prime Minister KP Oli told the parliament on Monday, saying he was giving the address for a “special” reason: “Nepal wants to maintain neighbourly relations as a good neighbour, not a petty, scheming neighbour…Nepal wants a similar behaviour on the part of its neighbours.”He pursued this line of argument, implying that India is wishing ill on Nepal, imposing on Nepal’s sovereignty and interfering in its independent status and policy. He then told the parliament that he would present the issue at the United Nations General Assembly.It basically amounts to saying he will complain to the UN about India’s behaviour. What a petty idea.Given his inherent character trait, PM Oli will find it difficult to develop trusted relations with India in the short term. His only option is to be diplomatic, predictable and consistent. So far, he’s not been able to do that. It does not bode well for Nepal’s foreign policy, which is the most important means of pursuing Nepal’s current priorities, including jobs, growth and climate change.Calculated relations Oli’s statement in the parliament indicates at least three things. First, his expectations from India have not been fulfilled. Second, his communications with the country have broken down. And third, he thinks India may be working to undermine his political authority.Let’s look at his expectations from the southern neighbour. Oli wants to hold high-level talks with PM Modi of India and build trusted relations.In the past two weeks, media reports and opinion pieces have discussed whether Oli would be invited to India or not. It has almost become customary in Nepal for a new prime minister to visit India first before embarking on other high-level visits. Such a custom indicates the value politicians accord to India, especially if they want their government to be stable.The second indication is that Oli is finding it difficult to communicate with people who matter in India. When you begin to communicate your feelings about India through the media, it indicates that your direct communications have either broken down or are ineffective.Behind Oli’s statement is an obvious intention to play the blame game or rally the public. India may be at fault for many things, but blaming India does not absolve him of inconsistencies on his part or the sheer inability to conduct diplomacy in a dignified manner.The third indication is even more significant. Oli has consistently promoted anti-Indian nationalism, and India finds it difficult to trust him. But would that alone be enough to undermine his government?Throughout history, India has had a significant influence on Nepal’s political process and decision-making. Through its influence on individuals who’ve received gifts, benefits, and resources, some at the highest levels, India holds significant leverage over political decision-making and, by extension, over policies and processes.An old playbookIndia’s calculated relations with the Nepali state came to the fore in August this year when Foreign Minister Arzu Rana Deuba visited India. New Delhi turned her visit into a high-profile affair even though she was unprepared to represent Nepal’s interests. Her visit, rather than building political trust, ended up creating more mistrust between Oli and New Delhi as well as between the Foreign Ministry and the Prime Minister’s Office.Although it is a matter of speculation, there are strong grounds to argue that such a courtesy would not have been extended to someone from the CPN (UML). It generates the question, at least in the public’s mind, whether India accorded special treatment to FM Rana as a “special” individual who happened to be the foreign minister and not as a representative of Nepal.Whether real or not, the perception that India is unhappy with Oli has fuelled the notion that the current government coalition is unstable.Throughout Nepal’s modern history, whenever top leaders are forced out, they tend to seek India’s support to regain power. I have heard firsthand from top political leaders that India used to put a pre-condition: First, demonstrate that you have people's support, then we will use our leverage to help you. Thus, the political leaders would launch a political campaign and hold mass meetings throughout the country. If the broader political environment favoured a political change, then India made the additional push.Now, as Pushpa Kamal Dahal tours the country, blaming a corrupt network of power brokers, we are reminded of this old playbook. During mass meetings, an embittered Dahal frequently alleges that “middlemen, brokers, and big cronies have gotten together, and with the strength of so-called numbers, have tried to strangle truth, justice…and good governance.” He also tells the public that his government was ousted because the investigations on corruption were leading to Budhanilkantha (Deuba’s residence) and Balkot (Oli’s residence).Oli’s inherent anti-Indian streakFor Oli, an inherent anti-Indian streak in his psychological make-up and an affinity with the Communist Party of China makes rapprochement with India difficult.In the last 10 years, Oli has made countless petty statements intended to rile and irritate India. He has also accorded China greater space in Nepal.In his book, former deputy PM Kamal Thapa expresses distaste at the way Oli made an unscheduled visit to China Gezhouba Group Corporation and disappeared for one and a half hours for a private meeting with Chinese Communist Party officials during his visit to China in 2016.Another issue is the Eminent Persons’ Group report, which Oli raised during the launch of Thapa’s book. “It would be good to receive the report,” he said during the programme. He made more anti-Indian remarks at another similar event.At present, any talk of the EPG report is viewed as an irritant by India, because it has consistently sent a clear diplomatic message that the report is dead. The unwillingness of a section of the Nepali populace to accept the message, including the CPN-UML, has not gone well in India.In a recent discussion programme, a former ambassador of India to Nepal indicated that the EPG report had become a new irritant in Nepal-India relations. He said that instead of insisting on the acceptance of the report, Nepal could pursue the individual issues identified. Trends in the last two decades indicate that instead of really trying to address the outstanding issues in Nepal-India relations, Nepali leaders are just interested in politicising them and gaining personal mileage.Nepal’s relationship with India has become more and more of a paradox. Nepal’s dominant ethno-nationalism is anti-Indian. Indeed, Nepal has many unresolved issues with India, but it’s economic development hinges on closer connectivity with India, which in turn hinges on trusted political relationships and ability to untangle complex issues.Snubbed by India, Oli is now headed to the US, where he could still get to meet a lukewarm Modi. He hopes to gain stature and make an impression at several forums including the UNGA, where he is scheduled to deliver speeches. We can only wish our PM well. \nFive years ago, on September 30, 2019, when KP Sharma Oli was prime minister for the second time, the government declared the entire country open-defecation free amid much fanfare. However, years later, thousands of people from across the country are getting infected with diarrheal diseases, including scores from cholera.Rautahat is among the nine districts reporting cholera outbreaks this year. Ward 4 of Rajpur Municipality has reported over 100 cases of diarrheal infection and hospitalisation. However, the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division said only 12 people from the municipality had so far contracted cholera.“Over 100 diarrheal patients from the municipality’s ward 4 have been hospitalised,” Khusid Ahmad, a health worker at the municipality, told the Post over the phone from Rautahat. “Contaminated drinking water could be the culprit for the cholera outbreak there. Samples of drinking water collected from affected areas have been sent for lab tests.”Apart from Rautahat, eight other districts—Lalitpur, Kathmandu, Kailali, Pyuthan, Makawanpur, Rolpa, Sindhupalchok, and Achham—have also reported cholera outbreaks this year. So far, the number of diarrheal patients who have contracted cholera is 95. Interestingly, most of the districts that have witnessed outbreaks of deadly cholera this year had years ago been declared open defecation-free.The Vibrio cholera 01 Ogawa serotype has been confirmed in the stool samples of the infected patients. Doctors say that detected cases of cholera infection could be just the tip of the iceberg, as most positive cases are being reported from the districts with active surveillance.Public health experts say outbreaks of cholera in multiple districts, even five years after the country was declared open defecation-free, show a huge gap between official declarations and progress on the ground.They say outbreaks of diarrheal diseases, including cholera, are directly linked to drinking water, sanitation, and hygiene conditions, and the country was declared open defecation-free without improving water and sanitation conditions.“Without ensuring the quality of drinking water and sanitation, among other things, authorities rushed to declare the entire country free from open defecation,” said Dr Mingmar Gyelgen Sherpa, former director general at the Department of Health Services. “Instead of improving basic water and sanitation infrastructure, we’ve focussed too much on outbreak management, and this is the wrong approach.”Even though toilets have been built in most households, open defecation is still widespread in many places. Drinking water samples collected from various parts of the country, including from the districts of the Kathmandu Valley, have been found contaminated with faecal coliform, which means the water the public uses for drinking is unsafe. The presence of faecal coliform, a microscopic organism that thrives in the intestines of warm-blooded animals or their faeces, indicates sewage contamination in the drinking water, according to doctors.A previous study had shown that 81 percent of water samples collected in the Kathmandu Valley were contaminated with deadly microbes.“We only focussed on expanding coverage of drinking water but did not pay attention to ensuring its safety,” said Dr Meghnath Dhimal, chief researcher at the Nepal Health Research Council. “Authorities concerned must also focus on improving the quality.”Experts say improving public hygiene is essential to ensuring water quality and avoiding diarrheal ailments. Awareness drives and health education play a crucial role in changing behaviours, which requires years of investment and continuous efforts.Along with investment in health education, attention should go to building climate-resilient infrastructures for drinking water and sanitation, as water resources have been contaminated by floodwaters in many districts. The effects of climate change have increased adverse events, including floods, which in turn have contaminated the source of drinking water, making people vulnerable to infection with diarrheal ailments.“Multiple agencies of the three tiers of government and non-governmental sectors have to make more effort to prevent diarrhoea outbreaks,” said Sherpa. “But there seems to be a lack of coordination among government agencies.” The World Health Organisation also stresses on a multifaceted approach as a key to controlling cholera and reducing deaths. \n\n\nRae was the envoy to Kathmandu during the promulgation of the 2015 constitution and the subsequent blockade. In this conversation, Rae talks about the evolution of Nepal-India ties since the blockade, regional geopolitics, what the two countries get wrong about each other, how New Delhi views Nepali communist parties and the governments they lead, and the change (if any) in India’s neighbourhood policy since the start of Narendra Modi’s third term in office. \nKunwar, a former Amazon executive, has led Daraz Nepal as MD for three years, discussing challenges and opportunities in Nepal's e-commerce and business landscape.\n‘Kanchhi’, by author Weena Pun, explores themes relevant to Nepali women's struggles in a socio-political context inspired by her journalistic background.\nAmidst controversy, CPN-UML accepts land donation from imprisoned businessman Gurung, raising concerns about corruption and a conflict of interest.\nChairman of the CPN (Maoist Centre) accuses the Nepali Congress, CPN-UML, and former monarch of fueling a political crisis by forming a government that aims to revise the constitution, including provisions for republicanism and inclusiveness.\nThe Maoist Centre has opened up electoral alliances with progressive parties other than the Nepali Congress and CPN-UML for upcoming byelections, while announcing a directive for candidate selection through consensus or majority vote at the ward level.\nThe Nepali Congress is holding a ‘100-day campaign’ to rejuvenate party committees, strengthen the bond between the party's local representatives and central leaders, and pacify the party's dissenters.The party’s central committee meeting, which concluded on September 1, decided to run the 100-day campaign from September 23 to December 31. Krishna Prasad Paudel, chief secretary at the party office, says many central leaders have already reached the districts they are assigned to run campaign activities.According to Paudel, the party’s seven joint general secretaries lead the campaign in the seven provinces. Senior leaders Krishna Sitaula, Shashank Koirala, Bimalendra Nidhi, and Bijaya Kumar Gachhadar, along with some central committee leaders, have either reached the assigned districts or are on the way, Paudel said.“When the party’s senior leaders and central committee members are in their districts, vice presidents and general secretaries of the party will monitor the campaign activities,” Paudel told the Post. “If necessary, the vice presidents, the general secretaries, and the party president will go to some districts.”One of the main objectives of the campaign is to renew party membership. “We claim our party has 0.9 million members,” Paudel said. “During the campaign, leaders will check the trend of party members renewing their membership.”The campaign has been launched at a time when leaders have already started to devise their plans for the next general convention. As per the Congress statute, the party must hold its general convention every four years. The party’s 14th general convention was held in December 2021. If the statute is followed, the party’s next convention should be convened by the end of 2025.Some Congress leaders have floated the proposal of contesting the next general election on its own, without forging electoral alliance with other parties. General Secretary Gagan Thapa floated a proposal to this effect at the Mahasamiti meeting in February that forwarded the proposal to the central committee to take a decision on the issue.“If we are to fight elections on our own [without an alliance], we need a strong organisation, therefore the party is emphasising strengthening the party by conducting campaigns,” Paudel told the Post.But, for the party leaders, success of the campaign will largely depend on the way it will be run.“Will the party leaders try to connect the party organisation to the public or will they conduct it in just a traditional manner? This will determine the success of the campaign,” Guru Ghimire, a Congress leader, told the Post.Ghimire suggested that the party leaders should also gauge the strengths and weaknesses of other parties in the districts.Ghimire also advised the leaders not to use the campaign as an opportunity to promote factional activities.When public disenchantment towards the major parties is growing fast, the campaign the Congress has decided to carry forward could be a means to connect the leaders with the public, says a Congress leader.“This campaign will re-energise the relations between the party and the public, and the party should work hard to make this event fruitful without baggage of internal factions,” Sanjay Kumar Gautam, a Congress lawmaker, told the Post.Reconnecting with the public is a compulsion for the political parties, say political experts. Soon after the November 2022 election, major political parties including the Congress held several campaigns to reconnect with the people but the masses may not be quite impressed by the leaders’ announcements they make during the rallies unless they deliver when in power. Earlier, the CPN-UML carried out various drives such as ‘mission grassroots’, a march along Mid-Hill Highway. “Political parties’ efforts to get connected with the people is something commendable in itself,” Geja Sharma Wagle, a political analyst close to the Congress, told the Post. “But, if the political parties don’t deliver while they are in government, people might not be convinced by their pledges.”Wagle adds that as the Congress is in government, people take the leaders’ speeches seriously only if they work for them sincerely.During the 100-day campaign, the party has decided to inform the party members and local leaders regarding the seven-point agreement reached between the Congress and the CPN-UML on July 1. Based on the same agreement, the two parties formed the coalition government led by UML chair KP Sharma Oli on July 15. As per the deal, Oli will hand over the government leadership to Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba after two years.Besides their power-sharing in the federal government, the Congress and the UML have shared powers in provincial governments as well. While Koshi, Lumbini and Karnali provincial governments are led by the UML, Congress provincial lawmakers head Bagmati, Gandaki, and Sudurpaschim governments. The two big parties have backed Janamat Party to head the provincial government in Madhesh.During a meeting of the coalition partners held in Singha Durbar on September 9, Prime Minister Oli had reportedly complained that the coalition partners did not work enough to counter the ‘disinformation campaign of the opposition parties’ against the Oli government. “The opposition has spread confusion about the government, but the parties in government have not shown any interest in countering the disinformation,” the prime minister had reportedly said at the meeting. “All the ruling partners should defend the government.”Congress leaders will inform the party’s district representatives about the spirit of collaboration with the UML, constitutional amendments, and other issues. They are also responsible for informing the party members at the grassroots about policies such as the common minimum programme.Earlier this month, the Congress-UML coalition brought the programme that has, among other things, reiterated its commitment to reviewing the achievements made and weaknesses observed in the course of implementing the constitution in the past nine years. \nTicket bookings for public transport during the Dashain festival will open this Saturday. Following discussions with stakeholders, the Department of Transport Management announced that tickets will be available online and at counters to manage the expected surge of nearly two million travellers leaving the Kathmandu Valley for the festivities.According to the department’s Director General, Rajiv Pokharel, transport operators will facilitate online bookings. “We have instructed operators to arrange online bookings wherever possible,” he said. “For counter bookings, passengers must obtain tickets only from official staff wearing uniforms and identification badges.”Around two million people are estimated to leave the Kathmandu Valley during Dashain. The department has introduced 20-point directives to ensure safe and hassle-free travel. Key measures include mandatory checks for alcohol consumption by drivers at major entry and exit points and the requirement for two drivers on long-distance routes. Additionally, those under 18 cannot work as assistant drivers.To assist travellers during Dashain, Tihar, and Chhath festivals, citizen help desks will be established at major locations such as Nagdhunga, Kalanki, Swayambhu, Halchowk, Machhapokhari, Gongabu Bus Park, Chabahil, Tilganga, Koteshwar, Jagati, Satdobato, Balkhu, Dakshinkali, Sundhara, and Sangha in Kavre. An inspection team comprising officials from various agencies will monitor travel arrangements with support from provincial transport ministries.Public transport operating on long and medium-distance routes must follow a designated queue system. Transport expert Ashish Gajurel noted that although bookings are open each year, passengers face difficulties. \"Bus operators don’t increase the number of buses during Dashain, despite rising demand. Authorities must increase the number of buses to ease travel,\" he said.Saroj Sitaula, senior vice-president of the Federation of Nepalese National Transport Entrepreneurs, however, argued that ‘unnecessary’ vehicle checks should be avoided to prevent inconvenience for passengers and drivers. He also highlighted the need to repair potholes on roads to ensure smooth travel.Earlier, Minister for Physical Infrastructure and Transport Devendra Dahal instructed the Department of Roads to complete road repairs nationwide before Ghatasthapana, the first day of the 15-day Dashain festival. The department reported that repairs are underway but have been delayed by the monsoon.The Narayanghat-Butwal road section, part of the East-West Highway, remains a major concern, with only 52.7 percent of its upgrade completed after six years of construction and multiple deadline extensions. The Meteorological Forecasting Division of the Department of Hydrology and Meteorology has predicted chances of rainfall in various places of the country for a couple of days more, raising concerns about travel difficulties during Dashain. Other problematic sections include Nagdhunga-Mugling and Mugling-Pokhara, with landslides and potholes reported along various highways, including the Mid-Hill, Madan Bhandari, Hulaki, and BP highways. \nPanic gripped locals in ward 12 of Chandragiri Municipality, Kathmandu, on Thursday morning after a suspicious object was found in the locality.The suspicious object was spotted in front of Balambu Secondary School, sparking fears of a bomb threat.Locals informed the police, and a bomb disposal team from the Nepal Army arrived at the scene. According to the NA Directorate of Public Relations and Information, the team disposed of the suspicious object, which turned out to be a pressure cooker.   \nKathmandu Metropolitan City has extended the area to prohibit building any structure on either side of the rivers in its territory.In a notice on Wednesday, the city office stated that construction of any structure has been barred on the additional 20 meters from the existing prohibited area.According to the metropolis notice, if the city has, under the existing rule, prohibited any construction on 20 meters from the area marked as river, the prohibited area will now be altogether 40 meters on either side of the waterway.The metropolis said the decision was taken based on a recent Supreme Court verdict that directed the authorities concerned to prohibit construction within an additional 20 metres from riverbanks in the Kathmandu Valley.Currently, construction is permitted only 20 metres beyond major riverbanks in the Kathmandu metropolis.The notice issued by the metropolis states, “No construction will be permitted on an additional 20 metres of land on either side of the river, and ongoing construction will be halted.”It has also asked one and all not to release contaminated water, including sewage, into Bagmati River and its tributaries. “Private and government buildings, as well as commercial properties, must install soak pits for groundwater recharge,” it said. “Waste must not be disposed of in the rivers. Non-compliance will lead to legal action under existing laws.” \nThe rhythmic beat of the Dha echoes through a Bhaktapur alley, blending with the energetic footsteps of dancers. Bhaktapur, which sees jatras and festivals round the year, is no stranger to music, dance and celebrations. But this is not an ordinary occasion. The performers in question are Lakhe dancers who are reviving the Ranjitkar Lakhe dance after a century.The young dancers are preparing for Indra Jatra this year, where mask-clad Lakhe dancers roam the streets to rid the community of hardships and suffering. Lakhe, demon deities revered as protectors of people and crops, are thought to reside in the demonic mask. As the dancer dons the mask, the spirit is said to take over.Bhaktapur was once a key site for the Ranjitkar Lakhe performances, but the art form vanished from the city after the 1934 earthquake.“Bhaktapur suffered the most damage during the 1934 earthquake,\" says Ganesh Ram Ranjit, treasurer of the Ranjitkar Group’s Bhaktapur branch. “The destruction left residents struggling to recover for a decade, making it nearly impossible to perform the costly Lakhe dance.”The Ranjitkar Group discovered the extinct dance in the year the group was established. They located a Lakhe temple in Bhaktapur that had closed after the earthquake. After two years of research, they learned that performing the Lakhe dance was seen as a good omen in Bhaktapur and involved hosting community feasts. However, the high cost of this tradition forced many to sell their properties, rendering it unfeasible in the city’s post-earthquake conditions. Over time, the dance was abandoned as more lands supporting these cultural events were lost during rapid urbanisation.“There was a significant decline in our engagement with our cultural heritage,” says Rabi Shakya, a sculptor and Lakhe dance teacher training the new dancers. “The encouraging change now is the strong interest from the new generation, which is making it possible to revive intangible heritage like this dance.”After 100 years, the Ranjitkar Lakhe Dance is making a return to Bhaktapur at this year’s Indra Jatra.“It’s challenging to accurately re-enact the dance since it hasn’t been seen in a century,” Shakya notes. “As a sculptor, I drew inspiration from Bhaktapur’s revered Shree Navadurga Bhawani to create the Lakhe’s mask.” Similarly, the dance was choreographed by studying Lakhe dances from Kathmandu, Patan, and Banepa within the Ranjitkar community, and combining them with traditional steps from Bhaktapur Lakhe dances.“As for the musical instruments, we are using traditional instruments like Dha, Dhime, and Ponga, which are said to excite the Lakhe,” says Rajendra Maharjan, Lakhe dance teacher and musician.Maharjan is one of the experienced Newari arts teachers working to revive the lost Lakhe dance. He is involved in training young students in cultural arts and is now dedicated to the Ranjitkar dance training, with the students practising together nearly every day.“Becoming a Lakhe performer involves more than just wearing the costume and mask,” said Sudin Ranjit, a Lakhe dance student. “We must train extensively with our teachers, and it demands a lot of hard work.”To Ranjit, a resident of Bhaktapur, the training is more than learning a new craft; it is a matter of protecting culture. Growing up only interested in instruments, he slowly understood how important continuing cultural practices like Lakhe dances is for their community.“The dance will not only bolster Bhaktapur’s cultural pride but also boost tourism and create jobs,” says Dr Purushottam Lochan Shrestha, a professor and researcher specialising in Bhaktapur and Newari culture.Shrestha notes that reviving the dance would offer employment to everyone involved, from the dancers and the sculptor making the masks to those participating in the rituals. “Economic centres throughout the city, from small businesses to large industries, will benefit from the influx of tourists attracted by the Lakhe dance,” Shrestha adds, commending the Ranjitkar group's initiative.Once the Ranjitkar community revitalises the Lakhe dance, the Ranjitkar group plans to set up a new Guthi house with a fresh community fund and organise annual events for the dance.“The Lakhe dance won’t let them separate,” Shakya remarks.In today’s globalised world, where identity often merges into a homogenised blend, shared cultural practices provide a sense of connection and belonging. This new Lakhe dance embodies that spirit of togetherness for the community involved.“Reviving the dance after 100 years,” Shakya says, “is about preserving our culture for the next 300 years.” \nThe Lions Club of Kathmandu Corporate, Nepal MD325-D has felicitated various personalities as part of its endeavour to recognise the contribution of the individuals and business entities for the society.As part of its campaign, the Lions Club of Kathmandu honoured Prateek Pradhan with Social Journalism Award, Sylapa T Rimponche with Social Spiritual Award, Erika Gurung with Social Player Award, Ramesh Corporation with Social Corporate House Award, Rajendra Malla with Social Corporate Leader Award and Rajesh Hamal with Social Celebrity Award.Likewise, Chandra Ghimire is honoured with Social Bureaucratic Award, Binod Das with Sports Management Award, Anil Kedia with Social Academic Award, Mohan Ojha with Social Management Award and Surya Nepal with Corporate Social Responsibility Award.The Lionism embarked in Nepal in 1971 as the Lions Club of Biratnagar under the stewardship of former Prime Minister Matrika Prasad Koirala.The Lions Clubs International says it has over 2,000 clubs operating across the nation. \nRoad networks have now connected the far-flung Karnali region, providing hope to people, mostly apple farmers, who can now send their produce to the markets and get reasonable prices.However, the poorly-constructed road networks have become a bane for the villagers. Whenever the crops become market-ready, disaster strikes. Rural roads are often a lifeline for these communities, but they remain closed most of the time due to an increase in disasters, which experts attribute to climate change.Now, some apple growers are discussing whether their harvests could be sent to bordering Tibetan cities, as roads are frequently damaged during the monsoon season at peak harvest time, halting supplies to the Nepali market. “It would be a great relief for apple growers in Humla if they could export apples to the Chinese cities,” said Namgyal Tamang, former president of Humla Chambers of Commerce and Industry.The apple farm in Dolpa covers 412 hectares. However, the district faces difficulties in sending the fruit to the market. Farmers complain that their apples often go to waste. Last year, Dolpa produced 3,696 tonnes of apples, but only 50 tonnes made it to the market, according to Ganesh Adhikari, chief of the Agriculture Development Office, Dolpa.“Roads are usually closed during the apple harvest, which is a big problem,” said Adhikari. “Many farmers store their apples using traditional methods. If the apples don’t decay, traders take them to markets like Nepalgunj and Surkhet.”Adhikari said apple production has increased this season, with output reaching 4,000 tonnes.In Simkot, the headquarters of Humla, apples have been planted on 518 hectares. Last year, the district produced 4,224 tonnes of apples, but none reached the market. Although a road network reached Simikot in March this year, transportation is completely stalled in Humla leaving farmers unable to sell their fruits.“The road has reached Simikot, but it has been three months since no vehicles have been operating. Some farmers use mules to transport apples, worried that the fruit will decay,” said Dasharath Rokaya, an apple farmer in ward 7 of Simkot rural municipality. “Shipping apples by air costs more than the fruit is worth,” he said.Rokaya said that apples go to waste every year due to a lack of roads. His orchard, which spans 25 ropani (1.27 hectares), has 150 apple trees. The cost to transport a kilo of apple from Humla to Nepalgunj by air is Rs130. And from Humla to Surkhet, it costs Rs120 per kg.Nimayangjum Lama of Bargaun in ward 3 of Simkot rural municipality, has set up a storage using traditional methods to keep apples for a month. “Nobody comes to buy in bulk. Though I store the apples, half of them decay,” she said.According to Lama, 25 big apple farms are operating in Simkot village. She said that apples are sent through flight only when the passenger takes them as gifts.Currently, an apple fetches up to Rs10. High quality apples produced in the upper reaches of Tilgufa municipality in Kalikot also go to waste.“There is a bumper production this year, but there is no road to transport them,” bemoaned Dhan Bahadur Shahi, a local farmer of Chilkhaya in Kalikot. “The high transport costs are another issue that farmers say do not cover the cost of production.”Last year, Shahi produced 42 tonnes of apples, but this season, output dropped to 30 tonnes as a hailstorm damaged the plants. His orchard has 500 apple trees. Sending apples to the Tarai cities through the Karnali highway using porters costs Rs10 per kg.In recent years, farmers in Phoimahadev, Chilkhaya, Rachuli, Jubitha, Chappre, Odanku of Mahabai, Gela, Mugraha of Subhakalika, Sukatiya, and Bharta of Kalikot have been engaged in commercial farming of apples.Although vehicles can reach the village from Nagma and Rachuli Bazar during winter, roads are generally obstructed during the rainy season, causing many problems for the farmers, said Parek Bahadur Shahi, a farmer from Jubetha.“Traders with their vehicles can reach farmers’ orchards in Jumla. If the road could operate round-the-year, all the apples could reach the market,” Parek said. “It is difficult for us to take our produce to the market, and on top of that, we don’t get fair prices for our products.”He said the village's lack of cold storage, packaging, and grading facilities forces farmers to harvest apples before they ripen. “Apples are sold for Rs45 per kg in the village.”Last year, 5,860 tonnes of apples were produced across 605 hectares in Kalikot.According to statistics from the Karnali province’s Ministry of Land Management, Agriculture and Cooperatives, apple is being grown on 3,419 hectares across all districts of the province except Surkhet. Last year, Karnali produced 31,000 tonnes of apples, and the production is expected to be around the same this year, said Dhan Bahadur Kathayet, spokesperson of the Land Management Ministry. He said storage problems, lack of grading, road access, and packaging contribute to the low market value of Karnali apples.Farmers are currently selling apples for Rs50 per kg. In Surkhet, a kilo of apples costs Rs125, while in Kathmandu, it reaches Rs250, Kathayat said. “With the lack of well-managed marketing, farmers are getting less value for their product, while consumers are compelled to pay high prices. Only traders and middlemen benefit.”Trucks carrying food and construction materials from Surkhet and Nepalgunj are returning with apples from Jumla, Mugu, and Kalikot.Among other districts in Karnali, Jumla produces 12,500 tonnes of apples on 3,100 hectares. While Jumla has long been renowned for its apples, the trend of commercial farming has been growing in recent years in the district.Min Bahadur Bhandari from ward 5 of Guthichaur rural municipality in Jumla has invested Rs220 million in his apple farm, which has 48,000 plants. The orchard produced 80 tonnes of apples last year. He said traders are visiting his farm to buy apples.Bhandari aims to produce 200 tonnes of apples this season. Tanka Giri of ward 3 of Guthichaur has planted 14,000 apple trees on 22 hectares with an investment of Rs70 million. It has been two years since he started apple cultivation.“There was no road in the past. When we couldn’t take those apples to the market, they were often fed to animals,” Giri said. “But now the demand for Jumla apples has reached international markets, and this has encouraged us to invest.”“Roads have been obstructed frequently for years,” said Karna Bahadur Budhathoki, a trader from Jumla. “A single day of halt in the transportation can spoil apples worth hundreds and thousands of rupees.”Budhathoki said that around 3 tonnes of apples that he purchased were spoiled. Currently, he is buying apples from farmers at Rs50 per kg. It costs an additional Rs20 per kg, which includes the cost of packaging the apples in cartons and transportation to Surkhet and Nepalgunj. \nThe much-delayed Dodhara Chandani dry port and check post project in farwestern Nepal has finally moved ahead after the provincial cabinet approved the use of forest land to build the facility.The Rs15 billion project is located in Dodhara Chandani Municipality, Kanchanpur district, and is listed by the government as a national priority project.In 2023, the government approved the project's environmental impact assessment (EIA) report.On September 18, the provincial cabinet gave permission to the Nepal Intermodal Transport Development Board to use 43 hectares of Mayapuri community forest in the buffer zone of Suklaphanta National Park, clearing the last major hurdle for the project.Once completed, the dry port is expected to boost the Nepal-India trade and help drive industrial development in the western region.Dodhara Chandani dry port will be the first business gateway to India from Nepal's farwest. The site is 245 km from India’s capital, New Delhi and 1,200 km from Gujarat state. Officials said the dry port will facilitate trade with other Indian states like Rajasthan, Uttarakhand, Punjab, and Haryana. It will also provide Nepal access to India’s largest seaport, Jawaharlal Nehru Port in Mumbai, enhance Nepal's foreign trade, and reduce costs.According to Nepali officials, transporting goods to Nepal through these routes will result in substantial savings.Most of Nepal's trade infrastructure is concentrated in the east, connecting to Kolkata port. Officials say the construction of a dry port in Sudurpaschim province may open up access to more Indian ports in the future.The project is also expected to reduce transportation costs and shorten the time required to import goods from India.Dodhara Chandani inland container depot will feature administrative buildings, customs office, banks, quarantine facilities, staff quarters, warehouses, and parking spaces.As per the master plan, the depot will eventually accommodate 3,000 20-foot freight trucks, although in the first phase will provide space for 300 trucks.The import warehouse will span 7,000 square metres, and the export warehouse will cover 2,520 square metres. The railway warehouse will be spread over 17,500 square metres, and the container stacking yard, a large open space for container movement, will cover 10,000 square metres.In the project's second phase, 126 hectares will be developed for additional warehouses and parking areas.A decade and a half ago, the World Bank conducted a feasibility study for the proposed dry port at Kanjabhoj in Dodhara Chandani Municipality, and the Nepal Intermodal Transport Development Board prepared another report in 2016. \"The cabinet has granted permission to the Nepal Intermodal Transport Development Board to use the land. With this approval, groundwork will begin within the next three months,\" said Ashish Gajurel, the board's executive director. \"We will now start cutting down the trees.\"He said that the national park has written to them to find land in other areas as compensation. \"If we can’t find suitable land, we will have to provide cash compensation equal to the value of the land.\"Gajurel said that they plan to open an office after the Dashain festival to begin work. \"We will clear the site to create a working environment for the Indian side and write to them to immediately begin the tender process and other related tasks,\" he said.According to the EIA, a total of 15,057 trees need to be felled. As per the Forest Clearance Guidelines, ten compensatory trees must be planted for every tree cut for development projects. Project officials say that 150,525 compensatory trees will need to be planted.Gajurel said they need to cut down 1,700 trees immediately, which they have already marked for removal.The dry port will be built under an Indian grant.According to the project, the transshipment centre will be constructed in two phases, and the first phase is estimated to cost Rs8 billion. Dodhara Chandani dry port will be located on the border with India. A twin dry port will be built on the Indian side in Banbasa.The first phase will be linked by road, while the second phase will be linked by rail. The completion deadline is three years from the start of construction.Work has already started on a Rs3.2 billion access road on the Indian side that will connect to Dodhara Chandani. The Indian government is building the access road.Three years ago, the government had decided to constrruct the facility in ward 1 of Chandani Municipality. However, following protests by local residents in Kanjabjoj, which is in ward 8 and was originally planned site, the project was relocated. Last year, during then-Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal's visit to India, it was agreed that the facility would be built by the Indian government.A four-lane bridge over the Mahakali River has been built, and an 8-km access road on the Nepal side between Gaddachauki and Malariya river in ward 1 of Dodhara Chandani.The dry port is expected to boost Nepal-India trade and contribute to industrial development in the western region. According to Nepali officials, transporting goods to Nepal through these routes will result in substantial savings. \nNepal has imported playing cards worth Rs61.1 million in just the first two months of the current fiscal year, according to data from the Department of Customs. The demand for playing cards, particularly high during the festive seasons like Dashain and Tihar, has driven significant imports from countries such as China, India, the US, and the UK.A total of 2,007,892 decks of playing cards were brought into the country during this period, generating Rs35.2 million in revenue for the government. Playing cards are widely used for leisure activities, and also in gambling practices during Nepal’s major festivals.In comparison, Rs64.4 million worth of playing cards were imported during the same two months last fiscal year, yielding Rs40.4 million in revenue. The data also shows that China was the largest exporter of playing cards to Nepal, contributing Rs52.1 million of the total imports this year, followed by India at Rs9 million.Last fiscal year (FY 2023/24), Nepal imported playing cards worth Rs321.8 million, with China and India being the major sources, contributing Rs282.3 million and Rs 26.8 million, respectively. Smaller quantities were also imported from countries like the US and Spain.In the previous fiscal year (2022/23), playing card imports stood at Rs 212.7 million, with Rs 187.6 million worth imported from China, Rs 21.5 million from India, and Rs 3.5 million from Brazil.The rising import figures suggest a steady demand for playing cards in Nepal, particularly during the festive seasons, with millions being spent annually on their procurement from international markets. \nWith the federal government slashing the budget of the nutrition programme, the distribution of fortified flour has been halted in all five districts of Karnali Province since the start of the ongoing fiscal year.Officials admit that the progress in improving nutrition in Karnali Province, achieved through years of efforts and investment, may have been jeopardised due to the suspension of the programme.“Thousands of pregnant women, new mothers, and young children have been deprived of fortified flour, which was crucial in reducing severe malnutrition among these,” said Lila Bikram Thapa, chief of the Nutrition Section at the Family Welfare Division under the Department of Health Services. “The provincial government has started providing Rs2,500 to new mothers, but there is no support for improving the nutrition of young children.”Malnutrition is a silent crisis in Nepal. The country has made significant progress in reducing stunting among children under five. Stunting decreased from 57 percent in 2001 to 25 percent in 2022, according to a report of the Nepal Demographic and Health Survey-2022.Likewise, wasting declined to eight percent from 10 percent in 2016. Wasting or low weight for a particular height is an undernutrition condition, which is a strong predictor of mortality among children under five, according to the World Health Organisation. Wasting in children is associated with a higher risk of death if not treated properly, according to it.Even though the survey report showed some improvement in the country’s overall nutrition status, progress is not the same in all provinces. The problem is more prevalent in the Karnali Province. According to the report, over 30 percent of children under five in the province are stunted, the highest in the country, which is an indicator of chronic undernutrition. The province is also the poorest and most food insecure compared to the national average.According to officials, as part of a super flour distribution programme launched in 2014, the government used to provide three kg of flour—fortified with all necessary micronutrients—to pregnant women, new mothers, and children aged six to 24 months every month to address chronic malnutrition problems in the province. For that, the Health Ministry used to allocate Rs 50 million. “This year, around Rs100 million has been cut from the nutrition programme budget and this is the main reason for the stoppage of the fortified flour distribution programme ” said Thapa. “Besides halting the flour distribution, the budget cut will also impact awareness programmes, which are crucial for reducing the burden of problems.”Nutrition experts warn that slashing Karnali Province's nutrition budget will have long-term consequences and could jeopardise the decades of progress in the sector.They say that authorities concerned should have promoted locally available foods, made people aware of the importance of nutritious foods and provided fortified flour to improve nutrition conditions and lessen dependency on freely distributed foods.They say that health authorities must continue awareness programmes to educate people about the importance of healthy food and what they have been providing.Doctors say malnutrition during pregnancy increases the risk of complications and maternal and neonatal deaths, as well as the likelihood of low birth weight. It is a major impediment to growth, affecting human capital and economic productivity.Experts say that nutrition has a direct link with the overall development of the country.They add that malnutrition affects children's physical and mental growth, ultimately affecting the country’s economic health.The Health Ministry had sought help from the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) to address the growing problems of malnutrition in Lumbini, Karnali, and Sudurpaschim provinces in the past.According to Thapa, the federal government has not renewed its contract with the World Food Programme, which provided logistic support for the fortified flour distribution programme.“This year, the government neither has renewed its agreement with the WFP (World Food Programme) nor allocated a budget for continuing the fortified flour distribution programme,” said Thapa.  \nSave the Children Nepal has launched a pilot initiative of introducing ‘rainbow kits’ specifically designed for transgender individuals impacted by disasters.The initiative aims to ensure that transgender people have dignified access to essential hygiene materials during times of humanitarian crisis.The rainbow kits break traditional gender binary norms by addressing the specific needs of the transgender community during humanitarian disasters, such as the recent flood and landslides in Nepal.“The rainbow kits are a response to the limitations of conventional humanitarian dignity and hygiene kits, which often fail to meet the needs of the LGBTQI+ population,” said Tara Chettry, country director for Save the Children in Nepal and Bhutan. “As diversity and inclusivity remain at the heart of Save the Children’s organisational values, I believe this initiative broadens our approach to humanitarian response, encouraging us to view aid through a more targeted and inclusive lens rather than a one-size-fits-all solution.”The kits were officially handed over to the Blue Diamond Society (BDS), a pioneering organisation working for the rights of LGBTQI+ individuals in Nepal. The BDS will distribute these essential kits to those affected by recent floods and landslides, ensuring that the specific hygiene needs of the LGBTQI+ community are met.The rainbow kit includes a carefully curated selection of items designed by Save the Children and the BDS to support health, dignity, and comfort, including condoms and lubricants, sanitary pads/menstrual cups/tampons, wipes, dry tissues, V-wash, panty liners, hot water bags, menstrual panty (free size), towel, hand sanitiser, toothpaste and brush, soap, masks, and other essential items.Tailored kits promote inclusivity and ensure that all identities are recognised and respected, regardless of their sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression and sex characteristics, said Manisha Dhakal, executive director of Blue Diamond Society. \nAmid the risk of a sharp rise in dengue cases in the coming days, the Ministry of Health and Population is gearing up to purchase rapid diagnostic test kits.Officials admit that they have only around 2,000 kits in stock, which is insufficient to carry out daily testing if cases spike.“We have decided to purchase rapid diagnostic test kits worth Rs 1 million immediately for dengue testing,” said Dr Bikash Devkota, director general at the Department of Health Services. “We have also asked health agencies under provincial governments to purchase rapid diagnostic test kits on their own.”Officials admit that the risk of an exponential rise in dengue cases has increased as the post-monsoon season, which is considered the peak dengue season, has just started, and the rainfall has not stopped. The recent disasters, which killed hundreds and displaced thousands, have also increased the risk of a surge in infections, experts say.At least 246 people have been confirmed dead, while 19 others are still missing following floods and landslides triggered by record-breaking rainfall some 10 days ago. As many as 173 people have been injured, and more than 17,120 others were shifted to safety, according to Nepal Police. “The risk of dengue infection has increased, as hundreds of displaced people are now living in temporary shelters, where water, sanitation and hygiene conditions have been compromised,” said Devkota. “Stored drinking water in these shelters could turn into breeding grounds for mosquitoes, the dengue vectors. We have alerted our health officials accordingly and asked them to launch an awareness drive in the high-risk areas.”Dengue is a mosquito-borne disease transmitted by female Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes. The same vector also transmits chikungunya, yellow fever, and Zika viruses, according to the World Health Organisation.At least seven deaths and 14,975 infections have been reported from 76 of 77 districts across the country since the start of monsoon this year. Experts say reported dengue cases could be just the tip of the iceberg, as around 90 percent of the infected people do not show any symptoms.Health officials say that they have communicated to provincial health authorities to prepare for a possible surge in dengue cases in the coming days. But provincial health authorities have instead asked the federal government agency to purchase testing kits and supply them to the provinces.“Some provincial health authorities have asked us to purchase dengue testing kits and supply them,” said Dr Yadu Chandra Ghimire, director of the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division. “But it is not possible for the federal government to purchase testing kits, which are required in huge quantities, due to budget constraints.” Since there is no specific treatment for dengue, health workers provide symptomatic care and diagnose patients based on symptoms.Of late, a surge in dengue cases has caused a critical shortage of blood in the Kathmandu Valley. The Central Blood Transfusion Service (blood bank) said that hospitals in the Valley have been facing a surge in demand for platelet-rich plasma and platelet concentrate due to the surge in dengue cases.“The daily demand for blood and blood components is about 400 pints, but we have only been able to collect about 100 pints,” said Sanjeev Kumar Yadav, senior technical officer at the Central Blood Transfusion Service. “We urge everyone eligible to step forward and donate blood. We have been struggling to meet the demand, and families of critically ill patients are in a difficult situation as they can’t find blood.”Officials attributed last week’s monsoon disaster and the start of the Dashain holidays to the decline in blood collection. They say the closure of colleges for the Dashain holidays, along with many offices and organisations suspending blood donation campaigns due to the festival, has led to a sharp drop in donations.According to doctors, mild to high fever, severe muscle pain, rashes, severe headache, and pain in the eyes are some symptoms of dengue.The World Health Organisation (WHO) says there is no specific treatment for severe dengue, but early detection and access to proper medical care can save lives.Dengue is a mosquito-borne viral disease transmitted by female Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes. The same vector also transmits chikungunya, yellow fever, and Zika, according to the WHO. \nRam Prasad Koirala, a resident of Nalagaun in Belkotgadhi Municipality, Nuwakot, spent all of Thursday racing around Kathmandu and Bhaktapur, desperately searching for platelets for his 13-year-old son, who has been infected with dengue.Doctors at the Maharajgunj-based Tribhuvan University Teaching Hospital, where his son is being treated, told Koirala to get platelets as his son’s platelet count had dropped to a dangerously low count of 13,000 per microlitre of blood. A healthy count ranges from 150,000 to 450,000 platelets a microlitre.“The doctors have asked me to arrange six pints of platelets, but I could manage only one pint,” a frustrated Koirala told the Post. “I spent the whole day visiting several blood banks across Kathmandu and Bhaktapur, but still couldn’t find donors.”This was a common refrain among many relatives of seriously ailing dengue patients who had come to the Central Blood Transfusion Service (blood bank) in search of platelets, as hospitals in the Valley have been reporting a surge in dengue cases.Officials at the central blood bank said that the demand for platelet-rich plasma and platelet concentrate has tripled compared to the usual daily collection.“Demand for blood and blood components is about 400 pints a day, but we have been able to collect only around 100 pints,” said Sanjeev Kumar Yadav, senior technical officer at the Central Blood Transfusion Service. “We urge everyone eligible to step forward and donate blood. We have been struggling to meet the demand, and families of critically ill patients are in a difficult situation as they can’t find blood.”Officials attributed last week’s monsoon disaster and the start of the Dashain holidays to the decline in blood collection. They say the closure of colleges for the Dashain holidays, along with many offices and organisations suspending blood donation campaigns due to the festival, has led to a sharp drop in donations.“We are ready to travel to Nuwakot, Dhading and other adjoining districts of the Valley to collect blood, as we have no other option for saving lives,” said Yadav. “Relatives of patients, especially those with dengue, have been waiting at the blood bank round the clock.”Officials at the blood bank are worried about a severe blood shortage, as colleges will not reopen until after the Chhath festival (first week of November), and many people will soon be leaving the Valley. They said there is already a daily demand for over 100 pints of platelet-rich plasma and platelet concentrate for dengue patients. As a single patient requires multiple pints, they lament that it is impossible to meet the demand at the current collection rate.“We have also sought help from mainstream as well as social media for blood donations,” said Yadav.Dengue is a mosquito-borne disease transmitted by female Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes. The same vector also transmits chikungunya, yellow fever, and Zika viruses, according to the World Health Organisation.At least seven deaths and 14,975 infections have been reported from 76 of 77 districts across the country. Experts say reported dengue cases could be just the tip of the iceberg, as around 90 percent of the infected people do not show any symptoms.The post-monsoon period is considered a high transmission season for dengue, but Nepal has witnessed outbreaks of the deadly disease since the beginning of the year and across the pre-monsoon, monsoon, and post-monsoon seasons.According to doctors, mild to high fever, severe muscle pain, rashes, severe headache, and pain in the eyes are some symptoms of dengue.The World Health Organisation says there is no specific treatment for severe dengue, but early detection and access to proper medical care can save lives. \nConcerns are growing about a possible rise in home deliveries in several districts after road links were disrupted last week’s devastating floods and landslides.Officials at the Ministry of Health and Population said that they are aware of the growing risk and have instructed agencies concerned to start risk mapping.“The risk of home deliveries has grown due to last week’s monsoon havoc,” said Dr Bikash Devkota, director general at the Department of Health Services. “We have instructed agencies concerned to monitor the situation and report back. We also held discussions with our development partners about the risks and requested them for help.”At least 233 people have been confirmed dead, while 22 others are still missing in the floods and landslides triggered by record-breaking precipitation in three days starting Thursday evening last week. As many as 169 people have been injured, and more than 17,120 others were shifted to safety, according to Nepal Police. Transport links to many districts have been disrupted by the floods and landslides that swept the roads and bridges in many places. Health facilities and birthing centres in many places were also destroyed in the disaster.Maternal health experts say that the recent disaster could cause a severe setback to maternal and child health and also affect institutional delivery rate.“Due to the disruption in vehicular movements, many pregnant women may not be able to reach birthing centres,” said Nisha Joshi, a public health official at the Family Welfare Division under the Department of Health Services. “Pregnant women and new mothers who have lost family members or property in the disasters would be unable to reach hospitals or health facilities for childbirth.”Health officials say that they have cautioned health workers in the affected areas about the heightened risk of an increase in home deliveries, which increases the risk of maternal and newborn deaths.A report on maternal mortality carried out by the National Statistics Office in 2021 showed that for every 100,000 live births, 151 women still died from maternity-related complications. Similarly, the institutional delivery rate has reached around 80 percent. Maternal death rate and home delivery rate are very high in remote areas. “We are aware of the risk of a rise in home deliveries, which poses a threat to the health of mothers and their newborn,” said Joshi. “We have requested the United Nations Population Fund and Nepal Red Cross Society to distribute warm clothes to 12 new mothers in the Nakkhu area of Lalitpur, who are taking refuge in makeshift shelters.”Maternal health experts say expecting mothers may face difficulties in attending regular checkups during pregnancy, which could put both their lives and babies at risk. Along with a potential drop in institutional deliveries, the number of antenatal and postnatal visits could also decline due to the impact of the disaster, according to them.With the government announcing free institutional delivery service in 2009 at all state-run health facilities, more than 2,800 birthing centres were set up across the country. The institutional delivery rate, which was around 18 percent then, has now increased to an average of around 80 percent across the country. The health ministry also provides travel allowances for antenatal care visits, offers skilled birth attendant (SBA) training to staff nurses, and hires them at birthing centres to help prevent deaths during or after childbirth.Nepal had cut the maternal mortality rate from 539 per 100,000 births in 1996 to 239 per 100,000 births in 2016—for which the country even received a Millennium Development Goals award.In the last fiscal year, at least 190 women from 51 districts died of complications during childbirth, data provided by the health ministry shows.The actual number of maternal deaths due to birth-related complications could be much higher, as maternal and perinatal death surveillance is being carried out in 51 districts only, officials say.Nepal’s target under the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals is to reduce the maternal mortality rate to 75 per 100,000 births by 2030. \nDusit Princess Kathmandu is organising a five-day trout festival at its SOI restaurant. The dishes will be available for order from 12:30 pm to 10:00 pm every day till August 30. In celebration of Nepal’s rivers and lakes, which provide an ideal environment for high-quality trout, the Director of Culinary Food and Beverage Service, Chef Utpal Mondal, and his team at Dusit Princess Kathmandu have crafted a menu showcasing the flavours and versatility of locally sourced trout. “As the festive month of Shrawan ends, people focus on healthy and nutritious food. Trout, rich in omega-3 fatty acids, vitamins, and essential minerals, offers a heart-friendly option that checks all the boxes from a nutritional and culinary standpoint,” says Mondal.He adds that the goal of the culinary event is to offer their guests a rare opportunity to experience a wide variety of trout dishes they wouldn’t typically find at home.The event menu features twelve unique dishes, six of which are drawn from diverse culinary traditions across continents. Three dishes are inspired by oriental cuisine, while the remaining three highlight flavours from Nepal and India. The menu has been designed to include various dishes, from soups and starters to main courses, including Mexican, Italian, Continental, and Thai flavours.While discussing the event’s highlights, Mondal said, “The celebration presents a unique opportunity for guests to indulge in a diverse range of trout-based dishes, something they wouldn’t typically have the chance to experience elsewhere.” \nI can vividly remember my first encounter with baking when I was 10 years old. We had just moved to our new home and got a cable connection. The cable opened a world of possibilities, as it gave me access to various contents.This was back in the late 2000s when YouTube would take hours to load, taunting us with its buffering screen. I was particularly drawn to travel and lifestyle channels, mainly TLC, Fox Life, and Food Network, which kept me informed about different foods and cultures. I don’t know why, but I was always drawn to desserts. It was fascinating to see how these miraculous treats made people smile at the end of the meal.Growing up in Nepal, I noticed that baking wasn't very common. While some families did have ovens, they were mostly multifunctional ones used primarily for heating food.I also noticed that most of our desserts didn't require an oven, as they could be made on a stovetop. So, you can imagine my excitement when my mom decided to buy an oven during one of her festive shopping sprees.I could finally feel the joy these channels portrayed. (I blame food writer Nigella Lawson for getting me hooked on a domestic lifestyle.) Then, one day, after watching one of the cooking episodes on television, I finally mustered enough strength and decided to bake something. I distinctly remember wanting to make a chocolate cake for myself after watching one of Rachel Allen’s bake series. I watched all the ingredients used in that recipe and scurried across my pantry, only to realise I didn’t have half of the stuff she mentioned. I then decided to improvise the recipe (a big mistake). I randomly combined the ingredients that I had in a mixing bowl and chucked the batter into my oven, hoping for a magical cake to pop out an hour later.After I saw the result an hour later, I was mortified. The cake was stuck in the pan, refusing to come out, and it was as dense as fudge. I convinced myself that the taste was what mattered most, but when I served a slice to my brother, he made a face of utter disgust.That was the day I realised that baking soda was not the same as baking powder.After this incident, I researched baking and found out it was technical. This was a blessing in disguise for me, as I loved science, and I started to view baking as a science experiment. I then reflected and evaluated how to perfect one's baking skills.I analysed my errors and noted down all the steps I did every time I baked. Home baking is a passion for many. The idea of turning a few simple ingredients into a delicious masterpiece is as enchanting as it sounds.Yet, for many of us, this seemingly magical process can often turn into a series of unfortunate events, leading to crumbled dreams and deflated ambitions. Dense cakes, burnt crusts, rock-hard cookies and unrisen bread, if you are an amateur baker, then you have seen it all. But why do these mishaps happen so often? And most importantly how do we overcome them?From my experience, behind every successful bake lies a series of challenges and mishaps that test even the most dedicated bakers. Baking has its own set of rules that you need to follow to get that scrumptious treat every time. So, to transform a recipe into an actual dish that will impress your friends and family, I am sharing with you some of the tips and tricks I learned from my tumultuous journey as a home baker.First things first, we have to look into the prime appliance that we are working with. Commercial ovens are of two types: one that runs on gas and the other that runs on electricity. We have to look at the oven present at our home and consider its pros and cons. The main benefits of a gas oven are its size and temperature control. One can quickly change the temperature just by twisting the knob, and it preheats much more quickly than an electric one. However, they are known to have uneven temperatures at times and release more humidity, making it harder to properly crisp or brown food. This can result in burnt edges and cold or hot spots. An electric oven, on the other hand, provides more even and consistent temperatures and doesn’t release as much moisture in the air.This dry oven environment makes it easier to brown your items, making it great for baking bread. However, while the dry oven results in more even cooking, you also run the risk of drying out cakes and other baked goods.Also, many people forget to preheat the oven before baking, which is crucial for maintaining an even temperature throughout the baking process. When baking cakes and bread, I like to place a small tray of water at the bottom of the oven to provide moisture and prevent the baked goods from drying out.An oven thermometer can be a baker's best friend, providing a true reading and ensuring your creations bake evenly. I also like rotating the pan midway while baking, as it allows for an even distribution of heat.The next thing people mess up on is measuring and the specificity of ingredients in a recipe. Our moms made our food with their instinct; it is something that they learned along the way, but when you are baking, you cannot instinctively add or omit a few steps.I think that is why we initially had problems with baking. In a culture where cooking comes instinctually, baking challenges us, to be precise. A gram of more or less of any ingredient can drastically alter the outcome. Different methods of measuring flour can yield different results.Every component in baking serves a distinct purpose and function. Flour offers structure, sugar adds sweetness and moisture, eggs bind things together, and butter enhances taste and texture. However, not all ingredients are created equally. For example, using salted butter instead of unsalted might change the taste profile of your meal.Similarly, different flours have varying protein concentrations, which affect the texture of baked goods. The type of sugar used also makes a difference. Granulated sugar, brown sugar, powdered sugar, and speciality sugars like turbinado or muscovado each add unique flavours to a bake.Understanding these nuances and how they interact is critical for getting the intended outcomes. Accurate measurement tools and techniques are essential, but mastering them can be a steep learning curve. So, I would recommend investing in a kitchen scale that allows for more accurate measurements by weight rather than volume.Moving on, leavening agents such as baking soda, baking powder, and yeast are required to make baked goods rise. However, they can also cause confusion and errors. Baking soda needs an acidic component to activate, but baking powder has both an acid and a base, making it self-activating.Using the wrong type of flour or sugar, or using them in incorrect proportions, can result in flat, overly raised, or collapsed cakes. Yeast, being a living organism, presents its challenges.The water temperature must be just right—not too hot to kill the yeast, nor too cold to inhibit its activity. Proofing times and conditions also need to be carefully managed to achieve the perfect rise.Bakers should also be careful about the way they mix ingredients. The method of mixing ingredients can significantly impact the final product. Over-mixing can develop too much gluten in cakes and pastries, leading to tough textures.Under-mixing can leave pockets of unincorporated ingredients, resulting in uneven bakes. Techniques like folding, creaming, and whipping each serve specific purposes and must be executed with care.Finally, home bakers must understand the importance of timing and patience in baking. Even a minute or two can make the difference between perfectly baked cookies and burnt edges.Recipes often provide a range for baking times, but factors like oven hot spots, pan material, and altitude can affect these times. It’s crucial to keep a close eye on your bakes and rely on visual and tactile cues, such as a cake pulling away from the sides of the pan or a toothpick coming out clean, to determine doneness.Baking is also an exercise in patience, a virtue not everyone possesses. Doughs need time to rest and rise, flavours need time to meld, and baked goods need time to cool before they can be enjoyed.Impatience can lead to underbaked centres, crumbling slices, and a general sense of frustration. Cultivating patience is as important as mastering any technique in the baker’s repertoire.Home baking is a journey full of ups and downs, but it comes with great rewards. The obstacles encountered teach valuable lessons in patience, precision, and perseverance.The satisfaction of success, the freedom to create, and the therapeutic benefits make the endeavour meaningful. Whether baking for oneself, loved ones, or as an artistic outlet, the journey is as fulfilling as the result. Embrace the flour-dusted countertops, occasional setbacks, and the joys of home bakingFor a beginner-friendly recipe that involves mixing ingredients and delivers amazing results, try my recipe for fudgy, nutty brownies that I call ‘Bliss Brownies’.Bliss Brownies150g unsalted butter plus extra for the tin150g chopped dark chocolate200g caster sugar½ tsp baking powder2 eggs80g cocoa powder150g plain flour70g mixture of nuts (walnuts and almonds)60g blended papayaMix all the ingredients (except the dark chocolate and nuts) in a blender or a food processor and blitz till you get a smooth paste.Fold the chocolate and the nuts into the brownie batter, making sure that the pieces are evenly mixed in.Grease a loaf pan with soft butter and dust with cocoa powder. Pour the batter into the loaf pan.Bake in a preheated oven at 170c for 40 minutes and let it cool in the oven for an hour. Enjoy with a cup of coffee or, as I like it, a scoop of vanilla ice cream. \nIn a world where acceptance and safety often seem difficult to attain, many queer individuals also struggle to find a safe space to express themselves. They have to hide their true self and face relentless judgement when going to public places like cafes and restaurants.This is the reality for countless LGBTQIA+ individuals. The need for a safe space for this community is not just a desire but a necessity—a space where one can be themselves. This struggle for safety and acceptance can be traced to crucial historical moments, such as the Stonewall Riots of 1969 in New York City.The Stonewall Inn was more than a bar; it was a refuge for the queer community. When police raided the bar, the community fought back. This series of violent confrontations, which began in the early hours of June 28, 1969, between police and gay rights activists, marked the beginning of the modern LGBTQIA+ rights movement. The spirit of Stonewall, the fight for dignity and the right to exist openly lives on in places like Inclusive Galaxy Restaurant in Kathmandu. Inclusive Galaxy beyond a restaurant is an ‘oasis’ for the queer community and beyond.Founded by Bishwaraj Adhikari, Mr Gay Handsome Nepal 2013, a human rights defender, the restaurant proves the power of safe spaces. It’s a place where the community can unite, free from the prejudice and hostility that often permeate their everyday lives.After years of working in the human rights sector, Adhikari and his partner developed the idea for Inclusive Galaxy. What began as a small cafe gradually evolved into a full-fledged restaurant, driven by the growing demand and support from the community.“In developed countries with strong LGBTQIA+ movements, you can find community areas like gay villages. These are created as safe spaces for people whose families and communities have excluded them. They also support new business ideas and pink tourism. I hope to see pink tourism develop in Nepal someday,” says Adhikari. His vision for Inclusive Galaxy goes beyond just being a restaurant. He aims to promote financial independence and empowerment within the queer community.Since its inception in February 2019, Inclusive Galaxy has become a key spot for many in Lazimpat, a relatively queer-friendly area in Kathmandu. The location is essential because the first LGBTQIA+ movement in Nepal started in 2001 through the Blue Diamond Society.Inclusive Galaxy, true to its name, welcomes everyone—queer and non-queer alike—to share a comfortable space. His vision was clear: to create a space where people of all genders and sexual identities could come together without fear of exclusion.“I didn’t want to make it exclusively for queer people because that would be excluding ourselves from society. Different groups need to live together and understand each other,” Adhikari explains.In the early days, the cafe attracted both queer and non-queer customers. However, when some of the residents learned about Adhikari’s identity and the nature of the clientele, there was a brief period of hesitation. “At first, I didn’t understand what was happening, but then I realised my identity was an issue for a few people. I believe people should be judged by others by their character, not by their gender or sexuality. Over time, as residents saw that we operated like any other cafe, they became more comfortable,” Adhikari reflects.Adhikari started Inclusive Galaxy to give queer individuals a place to be proud of themselves, counteracting the self-doubt and insecurity that hiding one’s identity can cause. This turned the cafe very quickly into a community hub. The journey was not without challenges, though. It was difficult to hire staff and cooks from the LGBTQIA+ community, and soon after the restaurant opened, the COVID pandemic made things even harder.Despite these difficulties, the doors of Inclusive Galaxy remained open. During the pandemic, many queer individuals, who were abandoned by their families or afraid to return home, found comfort at Inclusive Galaxy.Since many couldn’t afford to pay for meals, the restaurant provided free food from its resources. As the number of people needing meals grew to 20-30 daily, Adhikari started raising funds within the community.“During my time as an activist, many people came here not only for food but also to see an organisation where the queer community supports one another,” Adhikari says.“The time during COVID was difficult, but it brought me closer to the community.”Four years after its inception, the restaurant has garnered a loyal following. Sarosy Neupane, Miss Pink Nepal 2024 first runner-up, describes Inclusive Galaxy as her second home. She moved to Kathmandu to study in 2022. Being distant from her family, she started visiting Galaxy for meals that reminded her of home-cooked food. Over time, she grew attached to the café because of its welcoming atmosphere.“It’s heartwarming to see people from our community and different walks of life here. The founders even invite us to festivals like ‘Dahi Chiura Khane din,’” she shares.Neupane visits the cafe regularly and sometimes stays until 3 am, engrossed in conversations. “I hope more spaces like this can open in the future. If, unfortunately, this place were to close someday, I don’t think we’d have any other place to turn to,” she adds.Muna Chhetri, a trans woman who has been a loyal customer for three years, shares, “This is my safe space where I can truly be myself. I always feel judged in other restaurants, but that fear doesn’t exist here. It’s where even those who aren’t accepted at home can feel accepted.”Sahara Khadka Chhetri, owner of Pink Tiffany, Kathmandu’s first openly LGBTIQIA+ friendly restaurant and bar, frequently visits after managing the bar, appreciating the convenience of not cooking at home.She notes very few places like this cater to our community, and some even had to close during COVID. “As an entrepreneur, I know that sustaining these spaces is a challenge. But as more spaces like these open, they will make the way for a more inclusive and compassionate society.”The welcoming atmosphere at Inclusive Galaxy has also had a surprising effect on non-queer patrons. Samriddha Jung Rana, a twenty-year-old neighbour who identifies as straight, often visits the café and appreciates the importance of such spaces.“Previously, I didn’t know much about the queer community and didn’t care much. But now, coming into this café, I’ve been interested in their rights and issues. I’ve realised that we’re not so different after all. We are all human,” he remarks.The ventures like Inclusive Galaxy and Pink Tiffany have inspired hope for collaborative businesses between queer and non-queer groups. The recent initiative by the Nepal Tourism Board promoting Pink Tourism in April 2024 is a positive step. Still, Adhikari believes that more support is needed from the government and the private sector.Despite the progress, challenges remain. However, Adhikari remains optimistic about the future. He is working on plans to develop the restaurant into a homestay program in the future.“Like how different planets, asteroids, and stars make up a beautiful galaxy, people from all walks of life and identities make a beautiful society. I am happy that we are assimilating together in this space. We are not so different; we are all different and similar simultaneously,” he says. \nAditya Mishra is a Nepali chef and entrepreneur based in New York. Passionate about elevating Nepali cuisine globally, Mishra sharpened his culinary skills while staging at various Michelin-starred restaurants in the city during his time at culinary school. A recipient of the James Beard Foundation National Scholars Scholarship in 2023, Mishra’s early experiences inspired him to establish his own supper club, ‘The Sewing Tin’, alongside co-founder Akhil Upad.In an interview with Post’s Aarati Ray, Mishra discusses his restaurant in New York, serving Nepali cuisines there and the recipe for his signature dish.How did your cooking journey start in New York?At 14, I told my parents I wanted to be a chef, but they preferred I pursue a stable career like engineering, as many Nepali families do. So, I left for Louisiana in 2019 to study engineering.But, cooking never left my heart so, after a year, I left engineering college and moved to New York City. It’s been three and a half years and my parents only learned about it later. When my mom visited me in NYC and saw my dedication to cooking, she saw my passion and supported my decision.What sparked your interest in cooking from a young age?As a child, I was drawn to cooking shows on TLC. The glamour of cooking, eating, travelling and the prosperity of famous chefs was fascinating.Around age 16, I discovered Chef Anthony Bourdain’s groundbreaking book, ‘Kitchen Confidential’, which shed light on the reality of the culinary industry. I learned how he became a cultural icon in NYC, reshaping perceptions of chefs.I was also fascinated by chefs like Marco Pierre White, who was a mentor to Gordon Ramsay. Their stories of achieving fame while maintaining discipline intrigued me. But, as I grew older and entered the culinary world, I realised it was far from glamorous—it involved dedication and I am glad I persevered.How did the idea for The Sewing Tin originate?The concept of ‘The Sewing Tin’ came when I realised the stark contrast between the romanticised view of kitchen work and its harsh reality. Witnessing the struggles of many kitchen staff—economic hardships, immigration challenges and language barriers—I had to rediscover my love for cooking.During my internship at ‘Junoon’ restaurant, I met my co-founder, Akhil Upad, who shared my culinary enthusiasm despite his preparations for medical college. Together, we wanted to create a dining experience that was more personal and communal, offering fine dining with a sense of community.We wanted our food to tell stories, so we named our restaurant ‘The Sewing Tin’ inspired by the immigrant experience in NYC. When immigrants opened cookie boxes as kids, they often found sewing supplies instead of food.‘The Sewing Tin’ is like opening a cookie box and finding sewing supplies—something uniquely desi, or South Asian. How do you promote Nepali cuisine in New York City through The Sewing Tin?My partner is from Atlanta with Indian roots, while I come from Nepal, so our menu celebrates and reflects both cultures and heritage.We represent our respective cultures authentically. For example, we have a dish inspired by Newari cuisine called kachaila, similar to French Tartar. We present it as Tartar to make it accessible to our customers but infuse it with Nepali flavours, telling stories about its origins and giving diners a taste of my homeland.What do you think of the prospects of Nepali cuisine abroad?I’m on a mission to share Nepali food worldwide. I have served up dishes like chatamari and lamb sekuwa in my restaurant. But I’m still learning and want to explore more of Nepal’s cuisines. My big dream? To make Nepali cuisine reach more places because it’s got something special that can wow taste buds everywhere.How do you see the changes in restaurants in Nepal?The restaurant industry has deep roots in community and bringing people together, dating back centuries. While this core idea remains, modern restaurants have evolved, making changes to adapt to the times.Yet, in Nepal, despite the growing number of restaurants, many lack uniqueness and storytelling, focusing more on making money than fostering a sense of community.I’ve noticed a troubling trend of rising prices, especially for beloved dishes like momos, which makes people question if they're getting value for their money. It seems like profits are taking precedence over creating genuine, authentic culinary experiences.The industry is starting to lose the creativity and passion that once made it special. It might be time for chefs to shake things up, challenge the norm and bring fresh ideas to the table, revitalising the culinary scene with renewed energy and creativity.What challenges have you faced in New York as an outsider?Living in a bustling city like New York as an outsider has its challenges. But, this city is also full of opportunities for those who are passionate. If you stay true to your culture and want to share your story, opportunities are waiting for you.Even though it can be daunting because of the tough competition, the city appreciates determination and expertise. When I started my journey here, all I wanted to do was cook, eat and share the story of Nepal and its diverse cultures. Instead of focusing on the difficulties, I embraced the chance to follow my passion.What do you think about the criticism of blending Nepali food with modern culinary styles?Chefs care about their food—it’s like they’re sharing a story. They’ve put in a lot of effort to become skilled, so let them be creative. It’s okay to give helpful advice but don’t be mean just to criticise. Chefs shouldn’t also just copy what’s popular, they should cook what they truly love. That’s what makes food special and meaningful.Mishra’s signature dish:Confit Duck Chatamari A traditional Nepali delicacy with French influence.Ingredients:Duck (Legs and breast)Rice (soaked overnight)MayonnaiseWhole spices (cloves, cinnamon, cardamom, bay leaf)Red onionGarlicGingerMula ko achar (Fermented radish)ScallionsLemon juiceNepali pepperVinegarSaltSugarProcedure:For the Duck:Season duck with salt and pepper.Cook in a covered pan with whole spices, garlic, and ginger at low heat for 2 hours on a stove (270 degrees in the oven)Increase heat to crisp up the skin (approximately 15 minutes).Shred the duck meat.Confit Garlic Aioli:Mash cooked garlic and ginger and mix with mayonnaise, lemon juice, Nepali pepper and fermented radishes.Pickled Onions:Slice onions and cook in a mixture of vinegar, water, salt, sugar, and whole spices until softened (about 10 minutes).For the chatamari:Blend soaked rice to make a batter, let it ferment for 6 hours, and adjust consistency with water.Assembling:Cook chatamari batter in duck fat for 4 minutes.Top with shredded duck, aioli, pickled onions and scallions.Serve \nCeleus Baral exudes a serene aura when you meet her, and when she tells you she bakes, it makes sense. Even during a brief encounter, you can tell she has the patience needed to be a baker.“You can eyeball cooking, but baking is chemistry. You have to be meticulous. You cannot rush it, or it does not turn out as expected,” says the 21-year-old environment science student. She also runs the online baking shop Bakeleus. Recently, she has also started selling her baked goods beyond her online shop, with her first stall appearing at The Yellow House’s Night Market. Bakeleus’s menu lists a variety of offerings, including jams, granola, tarts, cakes, cookies, cupcakes and brownies. Baral began baking in 2020, during the lockdown, and launched her online shop last year.She grows much of the produce she incorporates into her baking, and believes we should all understand the origins of our food. “This connection fosters gratitude and a deeper appreciation for nature,” she says. Her background in environmental science, coupled with her affinity for the natural world, imbues her creations with a unique artistic sensibility. Each item she bakes is a testament to her creativity and experimentation, as she believes consistent practice is the key to mastery.Despite the demands of being a full-time student, Baral strives to accommodate orders, typically requiring a minimum of 72 hours' notice for delivery. She is a passionate and discerning individual, evident in the love she infuses into her baking. Additionally, Baral advocates for a zero-waste policy at home, ensuring that every scrap of food and all household items are recycled.Three easy to bake recipes you can try at homeMini carrot cakes Ingredients:38 g milk or yoghurt35 g all-purpose flour1/4 tea spoon ground cinnamon1/8 tea spoon ground gingerA pinch of cardamom1 tea spoon baking powder½ tea spoon fine sea salt2 large eggs, at room temperature27 g granulated sugar13 g brown sugar (or 39 g of regular granulated sugar)1 tea spoon vanilla extract27 g extra virgin olive oil33 g carrots, peeled and shreddedChopped walnutsCandied lemon or orange slices (optional for garnish)Cream cheese frosting56.5 g unsalted butter, softened113.5 g cream cheese, softened1/2 teaspoon vanilla extractA pinch of salt250 g powdered sugarDirections:For the cake:Preheat the oven to 195°C.

Yet, pockets of the past remain—small, peaceful neighbourhoods where houses are still made of wood, paths are made of stone tiles, and the stillness of a world that wants to stay intact and immobile. These places are known for tourism, culture, and the restoration of community pride. One such stop is the quiet village of Khokana in southern Lalitpur.Khokana is comparatively close to the mainland urban Lalitpur; from the ring road junction of Bagdole, it takes only a 10-minute drive to reach there. From the airport, you can take a cab directly to Khokana, which will take around half an hour. Get your cameras and hiking boots ready; the area is filled with historical artefacts and hiking trails.However, it is vastly different from the city. It is much nearer to the hills, where stone-paved paths, which could easily be goat trails, are rare in today’s Kathmandu.One such goat trail leads to Sikali temple, a major attraction of the area and accessible only on foot. The pavements are lined with big and small temples on each side, along with ponds that serve as clean water sources and a location for religious rituals. The houses are made of bricks and wood. The concrete invasion, although present, is minimal. Scattered every few hundred metres are small mustard oil mills, co-operative businesses of the locals of Khokana that have existed since medieval times.A site well-recognised for its historical significance, Khokana was even proposed to be made a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1996. Sikali TempleAround an hour’s walk from the historic town, Sikali Temple can be reached, which is also the location for its famed Sikali Jatra.While it can be reached through any public vehicle, a more holistic and adventurous route is to follow the goat trails on the outskirts of Khokana. This route, albeit long, allows for great hiking opportunities, scenic views of the hills surrounding the Kathmandu Valley, and a close-up view of the mediaeval but well-maintained architecture of the local houses.Even if you lose the way, which is very possible, the locals are very welcoming and more than willing to guide you. The main temple itself is three stories tall, and built in the Pagoda style, a common style in many temples in the valley.It is surrounded by a lush grass field which plays the stage to the Sikali Jatra held every year. The temple, like many religious spots around Khokana, is dedicated to the local deity Shree Rudrayani.The Sikali Jatra, a five-day festival that serves as an alternative to Dashain for the Khokana locals, is filled with chariot dances, battle enactments, and storytelling celebrations in the worship of Goddess Rudrayani.Starting from Ghatasthapana in mid to late September, the Jatra is vibrant and an essential experience for every visitor. Historical Khokana townKhokana’s historical town is located around 5 minutes walking distance from the local bus park. The town complex, paved with hand-made stone tiles, is graced with the Indrayanee temple but also has many red-bricked houses built in the local Newari architecture, some of them centuries old.One such house is the ‘Khokana Museum’. Although closed, it is widely popular for being the first house to be lit with electricity in Nepal, as Chandra Shamsher did in 1911.The stand-holder of the first light bulb can still be seen, serving as a historical monument for everyone to see.Similarly, the town complex is also filled with Guthi houses, small ponds, and even the local Ward office. While the Ward office provides a wealth of information for visitors interested in the area’s history, the Guthi halls symbolise the strong community support culture of the locals.The ponds, a notable one present right opposite the Indrayanee temple, have stone taps and remind us of primitive ways of obtaining clean water—a practice many locals are still engaged in.Yet, these ponds are also religious locations, especially used in rituals in the Sikali Jatra.Finally, a stroll through the complex allows visitors to explore old houses and historical artefacts in the serene quietness of Khokana, while the small outlets and Choila places nearby allow you to enjoy the spicy duck or chicken delicacies at the same time.Overall, the historical complex is enough to transport visitors back to a glimpse of the medieval past of the Kathmandu Valley. Mustard oil millsThe most well-known feature of Khokana is its mustard oil mills, which have been operational for hundreds of years and have been using the same methods of preparation since their inception.These mills, scattered throughout Khokana, are often community-owned, and even the ones owned by certain individuals have almost exclusively employed locals.Despite the advent of modern machinery, there is still substantial demand for their products due to the assured guarantee.When I visited one such mill, the local staff informed me that the furnace and oil presser used by them were 300 years old, given by the Patan royalty even before the Shahs became king.In addition to buying pure, organically created mustard oil and pellets, visiting these oil mills offers many educational benefits for international and local tourists alike.Khokana offers visitors a unique glimpse into a preserved bubble of the past through its tranquillity, preservation of ancient lifestyle and cultural elements, and remarkable self-sustenance.  \n“How much oxygen do you have for the summit?”I think this is the kind of question a film producer would ask. But when you're on the mountain, the answer is never clear.I have worked for a long time in the film industry and different art areas, especially photography and engraving.Working in various fields and drawing inspiration from them has become a new normal for me. I have made this approach my way of life without even realising it.I took responsibility for producing the last movie I worked on and shot the behind-the-scenes footage for a documentary. By doing so, I witnessed the entire shooting process and the journey of a movie.In the snowy highlands of Turkey, we had to endure the consequences of the changing climate to shoot ‘About Dry Grasses’, directed by Nuri Bilge Ceylan. The highlands used to be snowy in January, but by the time we got there in the same month, there was no snow. Nature was changing. It was responding to what was happening—to what humanity had done to it. In the end, it snowed, and we shot the intense snow scenes we wanted. But since most of our days were sunny, unlike what the director wanted, we had to shoot in the sunset and sunrise hours. As crew members, we spent many days waiting for the sun to set.Production requires creating opportunities, finding solutions, and being creative for a work of art to come true. For this, patience, endurance, calmness, and timing are necessary. On the other hand, nature wanted us to listen to it and wait for the right time.During that time, I witnessed many of nature's lessons. For example, I experienced extreme cold for the first time. We endured temperatures ranging from -33 degrees to +55 degrees. By listening to nature, surrendering to its forces, and working within its limits, we managed to persevere.No matter how much you prepare or plan during the pre-production phase, if you are working in nature, remember that nature will always have the final say.The film was completed, released, and connected with audiences. Its success at Cannes 2023 was followed by my trip to the North Pole for my project. I returned with a mix of wonderful developments, joys, and challenges. During this process, I experienced life and death, happiness and sadness, losses and awards.I realised the value of being able to breathe comfortably a few days after my father's chemotherapy ended. Just a few days earlier, he had said, \"Well done, my daughter. I'm glad you went!\" All the anxiety and hard work, filled with fears at the beginning, were finally behind me.Before going to Everest, when I was on the verge of giving up, defeated by my fears, I remembered my father's words. Everest reminded me of what he said while struggling to breathe, adding a turning point to my life.What does it mean to say ‘life’s turning point?’ How many turning points can there be in life?Who am I, and what am I doing in this world? How well do I know my own limits? Can I find answers to these big questions? These thoughts sparked my dream of journeying to Everest. Now, after returning, I can say that it turned my life around.“How much oxygen do you need for the summit?” sounds more like “How much do you need to hold on to life?” How many reasons do you find that give meaning to your life, keep you alive, and allow you to breathe? How much can you endure in the face of obstacles, and can you keep believing that a solution will eventually come your way?Can these questions be separated from the idea of measuring and assessing something, from learning its quantity and financial value? Can everything be known with certainty? Should the journey be fully understood in advance, with all its promises laid out? Should it be viewed like a purchase with a price tag, asking, “Is this journey worth this much?”I had never trekked before and had no climbing experience. I had lived at sea level my entire life and had never been to a high altitude.However, this journey was not only about the physical climb but also an inner discovery. After losing my father to lung cancer, his breathing difficulties taught me the fragility of breath, life, and existence. I also mentally prepared myself for the physical challenges I might face. Despite all my concerns, could this journey help me understand the cycle of life and the resilience of the soul?So, how could I make this trek possible? How could I land in Nepal? Despite all the economic difficulties and the many things I felt needed organising, I did my best and believed in it.Since I was embarking on this journey, I felt I should share about my travels and inspire others.Starting with photography, cinema, and engraving, which are already integral parts of my life, I dreamed of documenting and sharing the inspiring aspects of this journey.After months of correspondence and dreaming, it all came true. Finally, I embarked on the journey with the goal of creating photographs, engravings, and documentaries. I learned a great deal from my travels in Nepal, from the people I met, and from every moments I witnessed. I felt incredibly fortunate to have been able to honour my father’s memory with the peace and serenity I experienced in the Himalayas.During my 15-day journey to Everest Base Camp, I encountered nature’s masterpieces at every turn. As concerns like “How will I endure?” and “How will I finish?” started to weigh on me, the mountains suddenly parted with the clouds and gazed down at me.It was amazing to witness the appearance of ‘Gods’ that I had never seen before, in such immense size and in such a close, awe-inspiring manner beside me during that silent walk.As someone who came from one of the most crowded cities in the world, Istanbul, while I struggled with my daily questions and uncertainties, trying to control everything, they stood there calmly, as if answering me.They were just there—before and after.My guide, Lakhpa Sherpa, always reminded me not to worry about how high we were, how long it would take to reach our accommodation, or what the weather would be like. He encouraged me to live in the moment, and he was right.He advised me to focus on my breathing, not to get thirsty, to eat enough, and to appreciate the extraordinary beauty of the journey. In the mountains, plans dissolve and each moment is embraced as it comes.All the good wishes, prayers, and everything encountered along the way were for the journey itself. The mountain was full of life, secrets, and everything I had wondered about.This 15-day journey to Everest Base Camp was a solo adventure, yet I wouldn't have been able to complete it without my guide, Lhakpa, and my porter. Additionally, I was fortunate enough to experience the hospitality, generosity, and honesty at Trekkers Paradise, which organised the entire journey and provided guidance.I witnessed how dedication and sincerity are crucial in completing a journey safely and healthily. Ghanshyam Sharma, from Trekkers Paradise and Sauraj Jhingan, a climber who summited the Everest in 2018, shared their experiences with me during the journey.They experienced the 2015 earthquake while they were at the Everest Base Camp.As a filmmaker, their role as actors, and attention to detail played a significant role in bringing my dream photography and documentary project to life.The sponsors of my journey were Turkish Airlines, The North Face, Apple, Canon, and Stanley. My supporters include Oscar International College and Nepal Film Campus. Throughout the journey, I shared many experiences, memories, and countless photos and images with my students.On my way back home after 21 days, I celebrated my birthday on the plane. From the right window, the Himalayas bid me farewell. I felt like I had opened a new chapter in my life, and I was certain that I would return.I had made many friends and memories in Nepal.For now, I will be working on a documentary and preparing for a photography and engraving exhibition titled ‘My Soul Beyond the Mountain’.To the Himalayas: This summer was spent with you, but we will meet again soon. \nWe spent five days in Sri Lanka two weeks ago, driving up and down the island, covering almost 70 percent of its territory. Our tour spanned over 1,000 kilometres, including hills, beach spots, and heritage and religious sites.Our first stop in Sri Lanka was Colombo’s Bandaranaike International Airport. We were greeted by a warm and humid breeze when we exited the airport. The host briefed us (a group of journalists) that heavy rainfall has affected areas across Sri Lanka since mid-May 2024. Rain and storms intensified on June 1, with the most significant effects in the south and west of the country. We were lucky to have no rain in the forecast.On the first night, we checked into the lavish Jetwing Lake resort, an opulent sanctuary amidst the lush landscape. The resort’s expansive grounds were a retreat, offering a glimpse of Sri Lanka's natural beauty. We feasted on delicious cuisine, every bite exploding with flavour, introducing us to the island’s famed culinary delights. On June 7, early morning, the sun shone brightly, previewing the promise of an incredible journey ahead. We set off early the following day, eager to explore the mysteries of this enchanting island. As we ventured further into the heart of Sri Lanka, the landscape revealed its majestic nature. We were astounded by seeing Pidurangala Rock, a 200-metre-high granite colossus just a kilometre north of Sigiriya. The short hike to Pidurangala Rock offered breathtaking views of Sigiriya and beyond. We climbed the steep steps and soon were rewarded with a breathtaking panoramic view of the surrounding landscape. It took us 30 minutes to climb. The sight took our breaths away and left us humbled in the presence of such grandeur. From the top are glorious vistas of the surrounding landscape and an incredible view of the majestic Sigiriya Rock. From there, Sigiriya Lion’s Rock is visible, standing alone. This was the place where demon king Ravana had his palace in the Treta Yuga. Believed to have been built 50 centuries ago, the palace is said to have had a unique lift for Ravana and his visitors. Ravana imprisoned Sita in one of the caves at the bottom of this humongous boulder. Sigiriya is a fifth-century fortress in Sri Lanka carved out of an inselberg, a hill of hard volcanic rock that soared high above the surrounding jungle. We spent two hours atop the rock, mainly taking photographs. We descended from Pidurangala Rock, filled with awe and a sense of accomplishment.The journey ahead seemed even more enticing as we ventured along the winding roads, heading towards our next destination.Cash-strapped Sri Lanka plunged into its worst financial crisis in more than seven decades in 2022, with a severe dollar shortage sending inflation soaring to a high of 70 percent, its currency to record lows, and its economy contracting 7.3 percent.Thanks to the growing number of tourists, Sri Lanka is now bouncing back.In Jetwing Lake, we met Kasun Pradeep Somasiri, a receptionist. He briefed us that the resort is now 50 percent occupied. “That’s a better figure now as we are recovering.”The travel and tourism sector is a significant income generator for Sri Lanka. However, the economic crisis, the Ukraine–Russia war, and China’s zero-Covid policy have jeopardised the industry.Tourism accounted for more than 12 percent of the country’s GDP in 2019 and was the third-largest source of foreign exchange reserves, behind worker remittances and the apparel industry.Sri Lanka was poised to be one of the world’s best holiday destinations due to its rich culture, wealth of natural resources, and diversity of accessible experiences.However, tourism-dependent Sri Lanka suffered its first major setback with the Easter bombings 2019. This led to the collapse of inbound tourism flows as international arrivals declined by 18 percent year-on-year, and tourist expenditure fell by 17.7 percent that year. This was immediately followed by two years of pandemic restrictions. Inbound visitors fell to just 116,600 in 2021.An acute balance of payments crisis forced Sri Lanka to preemptively default on foreign debt of over $50 billion in April 2022, triggering a crippling economic contraction with spiralling inflation.“Tourism is gaining momentum,” says Somasiri. “The British and Chinese have started to return to Sri Lanka.”January-August is the peak season for foreigners. “From December to April, local people travel for holiday purposes,” says Somasiri. Before we started the tour to other religious sites, our tour guide, Sampath Mayadunne, told us, “Don't take selfies with your back to Buddha.” Turning your back on a Buddha statue and some other religious sites to take photos and videos is a strict no-no.The most common sight across Sri Lanka is the tank cascades system, an ancient irrigation infrastructure. The system is a network of small tanks draining to large reservoirs that store rainwater and surface runoff for later use.“These infrastructures were built by its ancient kings over 2,000 years ago to solve the water scarcity in the country’s dry zone,” says Mayadunne.On day two, we travelled to Ranweli Spice Garden in Matale. This garden is famous for its rare spices and herbs. A tour of the gardens will show you the cultivation, harvesting, cleaning, and packaging process, as well as the health benefits and uses of the herbs.On the way, we saw a colourful Muthumariamman Hindu temple, boasting hundreds of detailed sculptures in a rich mosaic of colour.In Kandy, we visited the Temple of the Tooth Relic (Sri Dalada Maligawa), one of the most sacred places of worship in the Buddhist world. It was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1988.The temple sustained damage from bombings by Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna in 1989 and by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam in 1998. However, it was fully restored each time.We then headed to Jetwing St Andrew’s, a luxurious 5-star property in Sri Lanka’s hill country of Nuwara Eliya, situated at 1,900 metres above sea level. During our stay in Kandy, we immersed ourselves in the city's charm and the serenity of the countryside. On the third day, early morning, we travelled to Nuwara Eliya, the area famous for tea estates that give many Nepalis the feeling that they have come to Kanyam, Ilam, in eastern Nepal.We visited a tea factory called Damro Labookellie Tea Centre, the oldest tea centre in Sri Lanka. Due to its cold climate, it is the most important area for tea production in Sri Lanka.In this tea factory, they make white and black tea, while the green tea is processed in another tea factory and then sent to Damro.After the tea factory tour and the tea tasting, we headed to Galle, our next resting point.We encountered narrow, winding, and maze-like streets and alleys in Nuwara Eliya, known as ‘Little England’. The town has preserved almost all its British-era buildings and is calm and beautiful. On our way to Galle, at the roadside, our tour guide stopped us at the famed Sita temple, which has Hanuman's footprints and is the place where Sita, wife of Lord Rama, was held captive by the demon king Ravana after he abducted her from India.We were at Sita Eliya, a temple named Sri Seethai Amman.When we reached the Hindu temple, rich in vibrant colours and architectural elements, it was full of devotees. The water stream adjoining the temple is believed to be where Sita bathed. Large footprints are found on the stones in the stream, and there is a saying that those belong to Hanuman, who came spying to find Sita’s whereabouts.In Ella, Ravana’s waterfalls are significant in the Rama-Ravana story. The cascade charms visitors from all over the globe. The waterfall is easily accessible and is known to have hidden caves at the top, which are believed to have been used as Ravana's residence.The 25-metre-tall waterfall is a beautiful cascade that provides the perfect backdrop for a photo to remember your Ramayana trail adventures in Sri Lanka. A short pilgrimage tour ended there, and it was now time for an adventure. Though it was not part of our itinerary, our guide decided to tour us on a train ride.Though short, only six kilometres from Ella to Demodera, it was thrilling. Everyone screamed in unison like kids on a fair ride to hear the echoes in the dark every time we passed through the tunnels. The sound of the train is subtly different inside a tunnel. For the first-timer, the darkness and shouts inside the tunnels when the train passes would be scary, like a horror movie.The train we boarded wasn’t crowded, but people had already filled the doorway, ready for the scenic journey.With the shrill sound of a whistle, the train slowly pulled away from the platform at Ella, passing houses, coconut trees and green fields.As the train progressed, tourists and locals were leaning out the windows and crowding to hang out the doors. I joined the crowd and hung out on a train. A short excitement ended there.After lunch, we headed to Galle and reached Jetwing Lighthouse. As soon as our group entered the hotel, they shouted with excitement.The hotel is on a rocky outcrop three miles west of Galle. Waves crash over giant boulders in front of it and produce howling winds.We were at Galle’s 17th-century fort five minutes from the hotel on day four. In the Bay of Galle on the southwest coast of Sri Lanka, Galle Fort was built first in 1588 by the Portuguese and lavishly rebuilt by the Dutch during the 17th century. It is a historical, archaeological and architectural heritage monument that maintains a perfect appearance even after more than 436 years.We then reached Hikkaduwa Beach, a popular beach destination on the southern coast of Sri Lanka. On the way, we saw a 30-metre-high Big Buddha Statue. It is a replica of the 6th-century Buddhas of Bamiyan destroyed by the Taliban in Afghanistan. It was created using the earliest known sketches of the statue. It was built in remembrance of the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami victims.We then travelled through the 222-kilometre-long Southern Expressway, Sri Lanka's first expressway linking the capital, Colombo, with Galle, Matara, and Hambantota, significant cities south of the island.On day five, we reached Colombo, the capital of Sri Lanka. Jetwing Colombo Seven hosted us in the bustling capital. We took a city tour early morning and visited Bally's Casino at night.On day six, we returned to Kathmandu early in the morning on a Sri Lankan Airlines flight, the airline that organised the trip in coordination with Jetwing Hotels Limited, a Sri Lankan hotel chain.National flag carrier Nepal Airlines, in its previous avatar as Royal Nepal Airlines, used to operate direct flights to Colombo during the 1980s. However, the carrier suspended operations following an armed movement by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) in Sri Lanka. There had been no direct air links between the two countries for decades.In 2016, Himalaya Airlines started a chartered flight that lasted a few months due to low traffic movement between the two countries. Sri Lankan Airlines started operating direct flights to Kathmandu in August 2021.“The main objective of this media tour is to increase tourism in both countries for mutual benefit. We want to draw Nepalis for pilgrims and leisure activities,” says Nilina Pathirana, Country Manager at Srilankan Airlines in Nepal.“We have understood that Nepali travellers tend to travel to Bangkok, Vietnam, Malaysia, Dubai, and Maldives. Nepalis have quite minimal knowledge about Sri Lanka and the religious connection between Lanka and Nepal. We want to promote Nepal and Sri Lanka jointly. This will be a win-win business,” added Pathirana.The airline said it currently carries 60 percent of the passengers from Nepal to Sri Lanka and beyond destinations like Tokyo, Sydney, Melbourne, and other Middle Eastern destinations. The return airfare for a 3.5-hour-long flight starts at Rs74,000. “We have a four-night, five-day package that begins from Rs80,000, depending on the properties and extended itineraries,” says Pathirana.Nepalis must submit certain required documents for visa processing, like their passport copy and bank statement. Due to this government-to-government policy, only Nepalis must obtain a prior visa. Otherwise, Sri Lankans are required to have a visa upon arrival.“The other best thing is that Sri Lankan Airlines can be involved with the visa process or facilitate the Nepalis tourists. Our main intention is to have a sustainable market in Kathmandu and make it a daily flight,” says Pathirana. \nMundhum Trek in Koshi province in the eastern part of Nepal is a new cultural walking trail. It passes through several indigenous ethnic villages and landscapes in Khotang and Bhojpur districts. This trail goes up to an elevation of 4,200 metres to the viewpoint of Silchung Peak and takes one through the settlements of the Kirati people. This route starts from Diktel Bazaar and passes through beautiful settlements like Chakhewa, Rawa Dhap, Salpa Bhanjyang, Silchung and Hanspokhari before ending in Bhojpur. There are some hotels in Diktel but trekkers are advised to carry tents. The trail offers panoramic views of most of the eight-thousanders, including Everest, Lhotse, Makalu, Cho Oyu and Kanchenjunga mountains. The spring season, March through May, is highly recommended for the trek.Janaki Mandir Janaki Mandir at Janakpur in Madhesh province was constructed in 1874 and is a blend of Mughal and local architecture. The temple is a three-storey building and has 60 rooms, making it the largest temple in Nepal. Pilgrims flock here by the thousands to pay homage to Janaki Mandir—Janaki being the other name of Sita, the daughter of King Janak. The temple houses an idol of Sita which was found near Ayodhya, the kingdom of Ram. The marriage anniversary of Lord Ram and Sita is celebrated in Janakpur every year on Vivaha Panchami, which falls in December. In the southwest corner of Janaki Mandir is the Vivaha Mandap, which has been built at the site where the marriage of Ram and Sita is said to have taken place. Another well-known temple in the vicinity is Ram Mandir, which is built in pagoda style and is hence different from the other temples in Janakpur that generally bear resemblance to Mughal architecture. It houses a female statue, said to be of Yogamaya, which has the reputation of being one of the most beautiful images of female forms in Nepal. Other holy sites of interest include the Laxman Temple, Sankat Mochan Temple and Hanuman Temple.Kuri Village, Kalinchok Kuri village, a popular tourist destination around 150 km from Kathmandu, lies at an altitude of 3,842 metres above sea level in Kalinchowk of Dolakha district, in Bagmati province. People visit the place to enjoy the snow during the winter besides the mesmerising landscapes and splendid panoramic view of the Himalayan range. Kalinchok gets snow mainly at the end of December and the snowfall continues till the end of February or mid-March. When there is snow, it is difficult for jeeps, buses and cars to reach the top of Kuri village. Chains are wrapped around the wheels of vehicles and specially modified jeeps with highly experienced drivers are used to carry visitors. There are several hotels and restaurants in the area. The road up to Kuri has also improved over the years.Annapurna Base Camp Annapurna Base Camp trek, in Gandaki province, makes for a picturesque journey that takes you to the foothills of the Annapurna South, up to 4,130 metres above sea level. The five-day trek (seven days for slow walkers) offers rich cultural diversities, typical Nepali villages and the flora and fauna nestled at the foothills of Annapurna. The distance from Pokhara to Annapurna Base Camp is approximately 81 kilometres. It is among the shortest and most budget-friendly treks in Nepal. For Nepalis, lodging costs around $5 to $10 per day. For foreigners, the overall cost of the trek ranges from $800 to $1500 on average per person. Annapurna Base Camp trek can be done at any time throughout the year as each season offers a different trekking experience. The ideal time for the trek depends on your weather preferences and what you expect from it. However, autumn (September to October) and spring (March to May) are considered the two best seasons for the trek, as the days at the time are warm and bright with clear skies.Bardiya National Park Bardiya National Park, located in the southern Tarai belt of Lumbini province, is home to one of the most elusive and majestic animals on earth—the Royal Bengal Tiger. The park, which covers an area of 968 square kilometres, is considered one of the most important protected areas in the country. It is a prime destination for those looking to catch a glimpse of a tiger. A bit of luck and patience will offer a good chance to see the Bengal Tiger. The jungle safari also offers one the opportunity to spot Asian elephants and the greater one-horned rhinoceros. The rare Gangetic river dolphins are occasionally spotted on rafting trips along the Geruwa River, the eastern channel of the Karnali river. Besides, visitors can enjoy the homestays and explore local Tharu culture. The right time to visit the park is from mid-September to mid-December and mid-February to May.Khaptad National Park Khaptad National Park in Sudurpaschim province is a protected area in the far western region. It stretches over four districts of Bajhang, Bajura, Achham and Doti and ranges in elevation from 1,400 to 3,300 metres. The park can be visited throughout the year. Trekkers are advised to bring their tents, food and other supplies. The Nepal Tourism Board says of late, social media has been increasingly influencing Nepali travellers to go to Khaptad. Since the far-flung Khaptad National Park is still offbeat for many travellers, the area remains pristine and fresh. The seasons of spring (March-May) and autumn (October-November) are the ideal times to visit the park. The temperature ranges from 10°c to 20°c offering pleasant trekking weather. The monsoon begins in June and lasts until September and during this time, roads often become muddy and slippery. From December to February, winter brings snow and chilling winds to the park.Limi Valley \nOnce again, my heart swelled with joy when my hometown came into view.Arriving at Lalikharka after the treacherous journey through Pauwa Bhanjyang and the bustling Kanchhi Dokan, Phidim, the headquarters of Panchthar district, revealed itself like a surprise gift. My home town, Phidim, is unique in the fact that it reveals to travellers approaching it from uphill. As the vehicle descends the mountain road, it slowly comes into view, its houses and buildings recognisable for the native son.This Dashain, I undertook the much-awaited trip to my hometown with my wife Kabita and daughter Aarohi. Little did I anticipate the transformation that awaited me.The moment I got out of the jeep, I noticed that Phidim, nestled in the lush hills, has undergone a remarkable transformation over the years. As I guided my family to my home, which had suffered damages in the 1989 quake that struck eastern Nepal, I found that old, mud and stone houses had been replaced by concrete buildings. The place was vastly different from the one I remembered.Arriving at my childhood home felt like reuniting with an old friend. Navigating its nooks and crannies with my daughter, we delved into the history of the house, a symbol of my cherished memories.My wife had visited Phidim years ago, spending a month with my parents. She, too, recalled beautiful moments she had had in the town. I asked the tenant about the neighbours and acquaintances. Some had died, while others had left for good.A call to local journalist Giriraj Banskota led me to the school grounds, where memories flooded back. This was where I spent my teenage years, playing ball, learning to kick, and watching major tournaments. Here, I even encountered a group of Western climbers headed to Kanchenjunga, the world’s third-highest mountain. I remember being awed by their shiny yellow tents, headlights and strange smell. I remember practising my tutephuteko Angrezi with the climbers. Birendra Shield, an annual sports tournament named after the late king, brought ace players from various schools in Panchthar district. The district also hosted Yuba Mela, an annual three-day fair to commemorate the birthday of the king, organising football tournaments in which teams from as far as Sunsari and Taplejung participated. I never excelled at dribbling balls. A boy growing up in a seven-member family, I soon found my interest in literature. In the late 1980s, Phidim hosted a major literary festival. In the run-up to the 1990 pro-democracy protest, walls were painted with anti-monarchy slogans, local politicians were arrested. I took my family to my school, Naya Namuna Secondary School. It was Saturday, so the school was closed. I peeked through the steel gate and wall, imagining myself labouring over classes. Memories are hazy, but what I remember most is going out of the school—to quiz contests with me leading the school team, to essay competitions at the District Education Office and to play carom board, a national pastime, in a nearby shopfront. Returning to the main street, the demolition of a landmark gate made me reflect on how cities transform, shedding old landmarks for new identities. Navigating narrow alleyways, I felt like a stranger in my own hometown. Multistory buildings have emerged and roads have been paved, reshaping the town. It’s the same place with a different face, leaving me nostalgic for the Phidim of my memories.We finally reached Shivalaya temple, which I told my wife and daughter was one of my cherished hangouts. A giant statue of Falgunanda (the Kirant leader’s birthday is celebrated on November 10) stood before the steps to the temple. Though my wife suspected I came here to smoke, in reality, I visited the temple in the evening to meet friends and talk about issues that mattered most to us at the time. It also offered a panoramic view of the town (I could not take my family to Gadhi Danda, a hillock across the Shivalaya).Towards the end of my journey, I felt sad about Phidim’s lack of prospects. To my dismay, I found that people have been leaving the town in droves. Despite blacktopped roads and multi-story buildings, Phidim faces a troubling reality. The lack of quality higher education and specialist healthcare has driven people away, echoing the circumstances that led me to Kathmandu years ago. Conversations with locals confirmed a mass exodus from the town, a trend that raises concerns about Phidim's future.My conversations with familiar strangers led me to conclude that Phidim has transformed into a transit town for pilgrims heading to Pathibhara Devi Temple, which is around 255 kilometres north in Taplejung district. I met dozens of people headed to the holy site. While pilgrims see it as a stopover, for me, it was a homecoming. The realisation dawned that Phidim is, perhaps, in a state of transition, trading its rustic charm for the hallmarks of urbanisation. While I left Phidim for higher education in Kathmandu, people from rural areas have flocked to the town in search of better opportunities, bringing life and energy to the once quiet community.As we bid adieu to my hometown, I couldn’t help but reflect on the inevitability of leaving a place, no matter how enamoured one is with it. Passing Kanchhi Dokan, I pointed out Kanchnajungha and Kumbhakarna to my daughter—symbols of my childhood. Phidim, now a blend of nostalgia and change, remains etched in my heart, a testament to the intricate dance between memory and evolution. \nUnilever Nepal, through its personal care brand Dove, officially sponsored Nepal’s National Women’s Football Team by presenting exclusive travel kits to 27 players and officials at the All Nepal Football Association (ANFA) office. This initiative highlighted Dove’s commitment to supporting the athletes on their journey to success, focusing on care, empowerment, and confidence.Dove aimed to strengthen its presence in football culture through a long-term, values-driven partnership, promoting women’s football and aligning with major tournaments such as the FIFA Women’s World Cup.Unilever Nepal hoped to foster positive societal change, creating emotional connections with audiences and building sustainable initiatives that extended beyond traditional sponsorships.As Nepali women continued to make strides in various sectors, Unilever Nepal recognised the potential of the national women's football team to inspire the future of women's athletics. \nLionel Messi scored his 10th international hat-trick and had a hand in two more goals as Argentina thrashed Bolivia 6-0 in South American qualifiers for the 2026 World Cup in front of an adoring home crowd at the Monumental stadium on Tuesday.Making only his second international appearance since recovering from an injury sustained at the Copa America in July, Messi capitalised on a mistake by defender Marcelo Suarez to open the scoring in the 19th minute.Bolivia goalkeeper Guillermo Viscarra made a couple of fine saves to prevent the hosts from extending their lead but he was beaten in the 43rd minute when Lautaro Martinez scored from Messi’s quick cross.Argentina made it 3-0 just before the break, with Messi setting up Julian Alvarez to score.Lionel Scaloni’s side controlled the second half and looked like they had extended their lead through Nicolas Otamendi, only to see the goal disallowed for offside.Substitute Thiago Almada did make it 4-0, however, scoring from Nahuel Molina’s pass in the 70th minute with the venue transformed into an Argentine party.Messi, 37, gave fans more reason to celebrate in the closing moments, beating two Bolivia defenders before unleashing a fierce shot past Viscarra to score his second.Messi needed only two more minutes to complete the hat-trick, joining Portugal’s Cristiano Ronaldo with the most in men’s internationals, the Argentine skipper scoring with a left-footed drive to take his tally to 112 goals for his country.“It’s really nice to come here, to feel the affection of the people, it moves me how they shout my name,” Messi said.“This drives me. Enjoying being happy where I am. Despite my age, when I’m here, I feel like a kid because I’m comfortable with this team. As long as I feel good and can keep performing the way I want, I’ll keep enjoying it.”Argentina are top of the standings with 22 points, having returned to winning ways after losing to Colombia last month and drawing with Venezuela last week.The 2026 World Cup will be hosted by the United States, Mexico and Canada. \nThe world’s largest technology firms are flocking to Southeast Asia to build data centres at a time when demand for infrastructure and computing power to enable artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly rising.The new investments are expected to contribute to the region’s economies by creating skilled jobs in data centre construction, engineering and maintenance, while also developing specialised talent in AI, cyber security, and data science and management.The investments will also improve the region’s digital infrastructure, allowing small businesses and large institutions to store their data locally, significantly reducing downtime while increasing data sovereignty.With AI-supported innovations such as searches on ChatGPT now requiring at least four to five times more processing capacity compared with traditional internet searches, data centre demand is expected to grow at around 20 per cent a year for the next five to seven years, analysts at Maybank noted in an October report.Data centres are large facilities built to accommodate servers, data storage systems and networking equipment that support better internet services and telecommunications.This, in turn, enables popular online activities such as gaming, live-streaming and investing, as well as more advanced technologies like cloud computing and AI.Thanks to its lower costs, power availability and geopolitical neutrality, South-east Asia is emerging as an ideal region for tech operators to establish a data centre base, with the top five countries being Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia and Vietnam.While Singapore is the preferred destination for hosting data centres due to superior infrastructure and a stable regulatory regime, the Republic had imposed a three-year halt on data centre construction between 2019 and 2022 to assess its impact on the environment.Malaysia seized the bulk of new data centre investments entering the region during that period, and now expects facilities with around one gigawatt (GW) of power capacity to come online over the next two years.That is double the existing data centre capacity it currently has.Another 3GW has also been announced and, if approved, will be gradually rolled out in the next three to five years, RHB Bank said.In comparison, Singapore’s data centre capacity currently stands at around 1.4GW.Among those channelling capital into Malaysia are tech titans like Microsoft, which said in May that it will invest US$2.2 billion (S$2.9 billion) over the next four years to build cloud and AI infrastructure in the country.Amazon Web Services (AWS) in August announced plans to invest an estimated US$6.2 billion to set up a data centre and cloud region in Malaysia.More On This TopicSingapore has one of the world’s densest data centre capacities: Josephine TeoMalaysia plans national cloud policy, AI regulations as Google breaks ground on $2.57b data centreThe cloud service provider is also developing a similar region in Thailand. It revealed plans in 2024 to invest US$5 billion in data centres in the country over the next few years, making Thailand its fourth AWS region in Asean after Singapore, Indonesia and Malaysia.In September, Google said it would invest US$1 billion to build a data centre and cloud region in Thailand, which has so far seen around US$9 billion committed by operators, according to analysts at Morgan Stanley.By 2028, RHB expects Malaysia to account for over half the data centre processing power across the top five South-east Asian markets, with data centres in Johor making up the bulk of inventories at over 2.3GW.That could put the Malaysian state in close competition with Singapore as a data centre hub for the region.After partially lifting its moratorium in 2022, Singapore awarded around 80MW of new capacity to Equinix, GDS, Microsoft and an AirTrunk-ByteDance consortium in July 2023. In May, the Government announced that at least 300MW of data centre capacity may soon be provided.Still, the Republic has signalled that it will be more selective when awarding new capacity moving forward.Speaking at a conference in May, then Senior Minister of State for Communications and Information Janil Puthucheary said data centres are collectively Singapore’s biggest indirect carbon emitter.He added that existing data centres currently contribute to 82 per cent of the information and communications sector’s carbon emissions, and 7 per cent of the country’s total electricity consumption.However, Dr Janil said Singapore may still award an additional 200MW of capacity to operators that are able to tap green sources of energy to run the facilities, and will provide schemes and incentives to support such investments.Mr Dedi Iskandar, head of data centre solutions at property investment adviser CBRE, asked that the authorities provide more clarity on this front.“The industry does not have a clear picture of what’s next after the additional capacity was announced in May, or when we can bid or how. We haven’t seen this information coming, and that has created uncertainty,” he said.“When data centre operators have no line of sight, they cannot make plans to invest in Singapore.”Mr Dedi said that while Singapore is still the preferred destination for hosting mission-critical computing applications, Johor, which still struggles with issues like talent and water shortages, is improving quickly.The highest risk for Singapore arises when the price gap for building and operating a data centre compared with Johor becomes too significant, and when the quality of data centre services between the two markets narrows, he said. \nFormer One Direction singer Liam Payne was found dead outside a hotel in Buenos Aires after the 31-year-old fell from his third-floor room balcony, Argentine police said on Wednesday.In a statement, the capital police said they were called to the hotel in the capital’s leafy Palermo neighborhood where they were notified of an “aggressive man who could be under the effects of drugs and alcohol.”The hotel manager said he heard a loud noise at the back of the hotel, and when police arrived they found that a man had fallen over the balcony in his room, the statement said.Emergency workers confirmed the death of the British singer, who was reportedly found in the hotel’s interior patio.“I am in shock right now. Liam was always so kind to me,” American singer Charlie Puth said on Instagram. “He was one of the first major artists I got to work with. I cannot believe he is gone.”US music channel MTV, streaming service Spotify (SPOT.N), and the BRITs British music awards all expressed their grief on social media, sending their condolences to his family and loved ones.Payne had a son named Bear with British TV personality and Girls Aloud singer Cheryl in 2017.Neither Payne’s record label Republic Records, nor its owner Universal Music Group (UMG.AS), could immediately be reached for comment.Police had received a call from a worker at the hotel requesting urgent help with an intoxicated guest, according to audio related to the case obtained from the Buenos Aires security ministry.“When he is conscious he is destroying the entire room and we need you to send someone,” the worker said, adding that the guest’s life was at risk because their room had a balcony.Emergency responders removed the body from the hotel to take to the morgue, while fans and onlookers who had gathered through the early evening, some hugging each other and crying, burst into applause.Crowd gathers to mourn boy band starThe “For You” singer rose to global fame as part of the since-disbanded pop band One Direction, alongside Harry Styles, Zayn Malik, Niall Horan and Louis Tomlinson.The boy band got its start after finishing third on the British version of the X Factor music competition show in 2010, but the group broke up in 2016 as its members pursued different projects including solo careers.One Direction was ranked the third best boy band ever by Entertainment Weekly in 2024. The group won dozens of major awards and sold some 70 million records worldwide, making them one of the best-selling boy bands of all time.According to Celebrity Net Worth, Payne’s One Direction and solo career helped garner him a net worth of some $70 million.Reuters reporters at the scene saw crowds gathering outside the hotel, where dozens of police and emergency services teams had cordoned off an area as night fell on the city.One 25-year-old fan, Yamila Zacarias, said her family had made a lot of effort so she could see One Direction when they came to Argentina, but she had decided not to go as her parents didn’t have much money then.“He meant a lot to me because the band came into my life at this time when you’re trying to be a part of something, and being a One Direction fan became that something for me,” she said. “This was the only time I could applaud him.”Violeta Antier, another fan, told Reuters she had come straight away after he sister told her Payne had died.“I saw him two weeks ago at a Niall (Horan) concert, another One Direction member. He was there, I saw him,” she said.“He was ok.”Payne had on Oct. 2 attended the Buenos Aires concert of his former bandmate Niall Horan on the Argentine leg of a Latin American tour that spanned Mexico, Brazil, Chile, Peru and Colombia. The two had posted videos together and with fans.Payne, who co-wrote many One Direction songs including “Night Changes” and “Story of my Life”, had previously spoken publicly about his struggles with mental health and using alcohol to cope with the pressures of fame.Last year he published a video to fans on his YouTube channel in which he spoke about his family, making new art and performing again after having given up alcohol. He thanked supporters for sticking with him through difficult times.Earlier on Wednesday, Payne had appeared to post on Snapchat about his trip in Argentina, talking about riding horses, playing polo, and looking forward to returning home to see his dog.“It’s a lovely day here in Argentina,” he said in the video. \nCanadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Wednesday said India made “a horrific mistake” by thinking it could interfere as aggressively as it allegedly did in Canada’s sovereignty.Trudeau made the remark two days after Canada kicked out six Indian diplomats, linking them to the murder of a Sikh separatist leader in Canada and alleging a broader effort to target Indian dissidents in the country.The Canadian leader’s comments were the strongest he has made in a year-long dispute that plunged bilateral relations to a new low.“The Indian government made a horrific mistake in thinking that they could interfere as aggressively as they did in the safety and sovereignty of Canada,” he told an independent probe into foreign interference in Canadian politics.Trudeau said Ottawa could take further steps to ensure Canadians’ security but declined to give details.India denies the allegations of interference and has expelled six Canadian diplomats in a tit-for-tat move. \nIn his final months in office, President Joe Biden is signaling new willingness to use US military assistance to Israel as both a carrot and a stick to influence its high-stakes confrontation with Iran and Iran-backed militant groups.But while the approach increases Washington’s involvement in Israeli decision-making just weeks before the US presidential election, it is unclear whether it will help achieve Biden’s goals, including preventing a broader regional conflict and getting Israel to address the increasingly dire humanitarian situation in Gaza, experts say.Biden’s administration announced on Sunday it would send about 100 soldiers to Israel along with an advanced US anti-missile system, a rare deployment that came as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s government weighs a retaliatory attack on Iran after an Oct. 1 Iranian missile strike.The Biden administration also delivered Israel a letter on Sunday warning that it must take steps in the next month to improve the humanitarian situation in Gaza or face potential restrictions on US military aidBiden’s administration announced on Sunday it would send about 100 soldiers to Israel along with an advanced US anti-missile system, a rare deployment that came as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s government weighs a retaliatory attack on Iran after an Oct. 1 Iranian missile strike.The Biden administration also delivered Israel a letter on Sunday warning that it must take steps in the next month to improve the humanitarian situation in Gaza or face potential restrictions on US military aid.Publicly, US officials say the seemingly opposing moves fit within longstanding policies that aim to both ensure Israel’s defense and to advocate for protection of civilians in the year-old war in Gaza.But current and former officials privately acknowledge that they are milestones that increase US involvement in Israeli strategy even as Biden heads for the door.Israel has frequently resisted US advice and has caused political difficulties for the Biden administration, which faces pressure from some liberal activists in the Democratic Party to use US leverage to rein in Israel.Aaron David Miller, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said that the administration’s carrot-and-stick approach “implies at a time when you might not think the administration is all that active … that they are clearly thinking and acting.”But he cautioned that Washington is unlikely to scale back its military support for Israel if the conflict with Iran deepens.“It is almost inconceivable to me as we approach the possibility of a severe and serious escalation – the Israeli response and what the Iranians will do in return – that this administration could consider anything like a serious restriction or conditioning of military systems,” he said.White House spokesperson John Kirby told reporters on Tuesday that the letter was not “meant as a threat” but that it appears the Israelis are taking the issues seriously.An Israeli official in Washington said: “The letter has been received and is being thoroughly reviewed by Israeli security officials.”Israel said Wednesday that 50 aid trucks were transferred to north Gaza from Jordan, a possible early result of the US demands.A DEADLINE TO INCREASE AIDBiden has prioritized Israel’s defense since Hamas militants triggered the war by killing some 1,200 people, according to Israeli figures. He refused to halt weapons flows to Israel, except for 2,000-pound bombs, despite outcry by fellow Democrats as Israel’s war in Gaza killed 42,000 people, according to Palestinian health authorities.The administration in April demanded better protections for civilians and aid workers in Gaza, which US officials say produced a temporary rise in aid flows into the territory.But Sunday’s letter appeared to be the clearest ultimatum yet to Netanyahu’s government since the Gaza conflict began, outlining specific steps Israel must take within 30 days, including enabling a minimum of 350 trucks with aid to enter Gaza per day.It raises the possibility of Washington making Israel ineligible to receive US weapons over its restrictions on aid delivery, said John Ramming Chappell, advocacy and legal advisor at the Center for Civilians in Conflict.“It is a small step towards a very significant change,” he said.Netanyahu convened an emergency meeting on Wednesday to discuss expanding humanitarian aid to Gaza, three officials who attended the discussion said, with aid likely to increase soon.The decision to send the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense system, or THAAD, is a similarly major step, said former officials and analysts, in line with a strategy of offering the Israelis close military support with the aim of influencing how they conduct military operations.A former defense official described the deployment as a “paradigm shift,” given Israel’s long-standing security doctrine to defend itself, by itself. It also raises the stakes, potentially, for the United States.“The US is putting actual US ‘skin in the game’ by placing US forces inside Israel, that only 2 weeks ago was on the receiving end of 180 Iranian ballistic missiles,” the official said.The Middle East has been on edge awaiting Israel’s response to a missile attack earlier this month that Tehran carried out in retaliation for Israel’s military escalation in Lebanon.Biden has objected to any Israeli strike on Iran’s nuclear sites and expressed concern about a strike on energy sites.“This is probably a carrot to try to cajole the Israelis to not go big,” said Thomas Karako, director of the missile defense project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, referring to the possibility that Israel could choose to strike nuclear and other targets.“And, you know, you don’t send a multi-billion dollar asset without some strings attached.”The White House did not directly respond to a question on whether sending the THAAD to Israel may have been part of a deal for the Israelis to agree not to hit Iranian oil or nuclear sites.Time is running short for the administration.The 30 days Biden has given Israel to comply with its demands will run out after the Nov. 5 US election, giving Netanyahu the ability to decide how fully he should comply, said Miller, especially if the Republican candidate with whom he is close, former President Donald Trump, defeats the Democrat, Vice President Kamala Harris.“Netanyahu believes he is at the point of maximum leverage, and he may well be. You may have a new president-elect that is much more to his liking in a matter of weeks,” Miller added. \nChaaaiiittt…The spontaneous eruption of the sound of victory thundered through the neighbourhood of Nhyokha in the Kathmandu core. The line of a kite cut another. Looking out the window of her house, Sajani Shrestha saw children running full speed, shouting and fighting as they vied to catch the falling kite and thread. And craning her neck up to the sky, she could not count but only be mesmerised by the innumerable kites strewn across the skies of Nhyokha, Bangemudha, Indrachowk. “There would be so many kites that they entirely covered the blue of the sky, making beautiful patterns of different colours,” says the 51-year-old. “And you cannot imagine the number of times the call of chait rang in the air.”Clear blue sky and gentle westerlies, the season of kites has arrived in the Kathmandu Valley. While kites soared Kathmandu's sky mainly during Dashain, the kite season officially started in Nag Panchami (August) and ended on the Haribodhini Ekadashi (November). And from royalities to commoners, young and old all flew kites from rooftops and open grounds. Even those who did not, like Sajani, revelled in the live spectacle in the sky as kites soared and fought. With Bhimsen Thapa’s help, King Girvanyuddha flies kites The earliest written account of kite flying is believed to date to 200 BC in China. In Kathmandu, this tradition has religious and socio-cultural and environmental significance, says Tina Manandhar, lecturer of Nepalese History, Culture and Archaeology at Tribhuvan University. According to her, it is believed that kites in Kathmandu skies carry a message to the god of rain Indra that the valley's farmers have had enough rain for their crops. That is why Kathmandu farmers scolded anyone flying kites before plantation season.In an article ‘Changako Utpati Ra Bikas’ published in Gorkhapatra in 1995, historian Rajesh Gautam points to the lack of written documents indicating the exact time when kite culture was introduced in Nepal. Exploring different opinions on kite's introduction to Nepal, he writes that “some have opined the possibility that the skill and tradition of kite flying might have entered Nepal through India.” Yet some others, he writes, state that kites “came to Nepal from Japan during the time of [Rana PM] Dev Shumsher.”He concludes that most likely this tradition was introduced by Malla-era Newar traders: “But since Nepal’s relationship with Tibet and China is very old and direct, kites might have entered Nepal through the Newar traders who were engaged in the trade. One can estimate that the kite was introduced to Nepal during the (mediaeval) Malla regime.”In Social History of Nepal, TR Vaidya, Tri Ratna Manandhar and Shankar Lal Joshi write that there exists documented evidence of the kite flying from the early 19th century. The authors state that Sundarananda, a contemporary poet, has mentioned that the young king Girvanyuddha Bikram Shah (r.1799-1816), with the help of Prime Minister Bhimsen Thapa, flew kites from the towering temple of Taleju Bhawani, Hanumandhoka. And when the king's kite cut the kites of the youngsters, they were located and rewarded with money.In Tyas Bakhatko Nepal, Sardar Bhim Bahadur Pandey states that “During the month of Kartik [October-November] young and old all flew kites,” suggesting that kite culture was ubiquitous in Kathmandu by the early twentieth century.Anticipations and preparationsKite flying in Nepal requires a kite, a lattai (a wooden spool), thread and majha (homemade adhesive prepared by boiling snail slime, rice or sago, and powdered glass from burnt electric bulbs and coated on the line to sharpen it for kite fighting).77-year-old Nirmal Man Tuladhar, an avid kite flyer and retired professor of Linguistics at the Tribhuvan University, explains how Nepali tradition of kite flying was both expensive and needing advance preparation.“In our times, it wasn’t easy to fly kites,” he says. “We had to prepare majha …And as Nepali kites are fighter kites, we mainly fought with other kites [which meant we spent a lot of threads].”This preparation needed first and foremost of passing a hurdle: securing finances and materials to fly kites. While lattai was a one-time investment that could be saved for years, kites and threads had to be replenished every time a kite was cut.“Those were the times when parents wanted us to be more focused in our studies. They only gave money [to buy kites] after immense pestering,” says 80-year-old Dwarika Nath Dhungel, former Secretary of Nepal government, speaking of the 1950s and 1960s.Biodiversity specialist and botanist Tirtha Bahadur Shrestha, 86, was born in Mahabouddha and began flying kites from 1951-52. He saved what little money he got for afternoon snacks to buy Hattimar reel, a brand of line wound in a small lattai, which was strong and sharp and where majha stuck well.Raghuji Pant, a member of parliament, also recalls the difficulty in securing money to sustain his kite flying in and around Kathmandu core in the 1960s and early 1970s. “Four to five of my kites were cut in a day,” writes the 67-year-old in his 2019 article “Changa Jastai Udi Hidne Man” published in Himalkhabar. “[This caused] the line in the spool to shorten. From Bhadra [August-September] to one to one and a half months after Dashain I spent flying kites. So, it was difficult for me to have enough kites even after getting money from grandfather, grandmother, mother and everyone.”Kites and thread secured, now began the crucial work of preparing and applying majha whose strength determined how well it cut other kites. Govinda Tandon, 70, a historian and heritage expert, who grew up in Battisputali, was also an ardent kite flyer.“Materials for making majha were prepared right from the morning on a holiday,\" he writes in his article “Dashainko Butte Changa” published in Gorkhapatra. “Because this work couldn’t be accomplished without a collaboration of 3-4 friends, a holiday was set aside for this. Moreover, a sunny day was considered appropriate. If the majha didn’t dry, the thread could turn moist, and so if it felt like the day wouldn’t be sunny, the entire plan…was aborted.”Kite makers, kite sellers and variety of kites One of the oldest shops in Kathmandu's memory, Shree Chitrakar Kite Center in Tyauda, Asan is bustling with customers during Dashain. “When my grandmother got married and came to this house at age 12 [in early 1940s], this shop was already here,” says its fourth generation owner 47-year-old Dinoj Chitrakar. “So the shop must be around a hundred years old.”Another shop that stands out in Kathmandu's memory is Manandhar Kite Center in Kalimati, established in 1949, and currently run by brothers Mohan Man and Sundar Man Manandhar.In his book Antar Taranga, artist and writer Manuj Babu Mishra recalls “a kite shop near the old halwai shop of Chabahil” in the 1940s. Dhungel and his 1960 batchmates of Juddhodaya Public School recall the kite shops from the 1950s and 1960s – Bekhacha’s Shop at Netapacho, Bhaicha’s Shop at Nhyokha, Lata Manandhar’s Shop at Maru, Kanchha Buddha Bajracharya Shop at Tyauda.Besides the shops, there were makers and sellers of kites cloistered in different localities of Kathmandu Valley.In Kwalkhu, Patan was a Joshi who made Nepali paper kites.“One day I accompanied my uncle to buy kites,\" writes Dibya Giri, 69, in his 2023 article “Changa” in Sahitya Post. “I was amazed to see the huge stacks of kites there. We used to call it the house of the kite maker.”In Nhyokha, Purna Bahadur Shrestha began making kites as a teenager and started his own kite business in the 1950s, according to his daughter Sajani.These kites, made out of Nepali paper, often had different paintings. Mishra recalls painting kites for the kite shop in Chabahil.“I went to that kite shop and with the freely available colours and Nepali papers, I spent my day painting faces, birds, animals, masks, mountains, hills, whatever came to my mind,” he writes in the book. “Such kites apparently sold well!”Most septuagenarians and older generations like Tuladhar and Tirtha Bahadur recall flying kites made of Nepali paper when young. Tirtha Bahadur says that kites from Lucknow began coming to Kathmandu only after the late 1950s. But at least a section of Kathmandu was flying kites from Lucknow from the early twentieth century. Vaidya, Manandhar and Joshi write that the Ranas and Shahs imported kites from Lucknow and that from them, their favourite employees also got to fly some. These kites were large and, in Tyas Bakhatko Nepal, Pande writes that they were referred to as Lucknowia kites.Known for their characteristic hissing sound they made while flying, light body, swift movement and ability to take sharp turns, Lucknow kites were preferred by kite fighters.“Lucknow kites were lighter and could be manoeuvred well,” says Tuladhar. “Kites of Nepali paper were stable but difficult to manoeuvre. They were also expensive. So only some fighters flew Nepali paper kites.”The kites had different names depending upon their designs and colours – Ambe (a heart in the centre), Dibdibe (chequered), Pakhete (a different coloured paper on one edge), Sete (white-coloured), Nilchi (blue-coloured), Rate (red-coloured) and so on.The kite fighters preferred the strong and sharp Hattimar reel that came on a small lattai. The Belchamar reel was cheaper but weaker and prone to be cut by other threads. Kite fliers and kite watchers on rooftops and open groundsBibek Shrestha, 57, and his two brothers took stacks of kites and climbed their rooftops. The rooftops around theirs in the neighbourhood of Nhyokha – in fact in all core settlements of the Valley – were filled with kite fliers and spectators. Many risked precariously balancing on the sloped roofs.While Bibek and his brothers’ kites alighted to meet the sea of kites in the sky, their sister Sajani and other family members gathered around to revel in the live spectacle.Dhungel remembers the rooftops of Jhochhen and surroundings of the 1950s and 1960s swelled with kite fliers. Dhungel did try to fly kites. But he did not become a successful kite flyer. What he did become was, like Sajani and many Kathmandu residents, an admirer of kites soaring in the sky.“But more than engaging in my unsuccessful kite flying attempts, I enjoyed looking at the kites flying. There would be a big crowd of spectators. Females and other family members watched the kites fly as they ate meat and chiura. Some even drank and rejoiced as they flew kites.”When the age of cassette player and speakers dawned in the 1980s, songs blared from the speakers alongside kite flying. Chitrakar and Bibek invited their friends, put their favourite songs on speakers and spent entire afternoons flying kites, dancing, singing and eating.Away from the core cities, in the villages in the Valley, people flew kites in open fields. Like Dibya, who set his kite for flight from the banks of Godavari River in Tikathali. Chhauni was also a popular space for flying kites.Kathmandu’s joy in kite fightingBibek pulled his kite down and then manoeuvred it back up so his line touched his opponent's line from below and quickly reeled out his line. The resulting sharpness from the speed cut the opponent's line.Chaaaiiitttt………“The greatest fun comes from cutting another kite's string,” writes Tuladhar in his 1996 article “Cutting is the greatest fun” published in magazine Kite Lines. “With its coating of adhesive paste and ground glass, the string is as sharp and abrasive as sandpaper on your opponent's line.”Nepali kite, Tuladhar says, is made to fight other kites, and describes how a kite line cuts the other.“The technique is to touch your rival's string and immediately reel out line at high speed,” he writes. “The Nepalese style of kite flying is aggressive, and though the kites look simple, they are strategically designed for bringing down other kites.”At any given time, like Bibek’s kite above Nhyokha sky, skies above the Valley were filled with raging kites, swinging, coming down and going up as the fighters reeled in and out their lattais in ferocious attempts to bring down other kites.Meanwhile spectators cheered. “Even passersby stopped to look at the kites,” recalls Tina.The moment of a kite cutting was accompanied by the sound of chait, and children ran in the direction of the falling kite to grab it and the thread in what was termed as, Dibya says, changa lutne/dhago lutne.Dhungel always joined in to shout the chait resounding through the locality of Jhochhen and almost automatically his feet sped towards the severed kites' direction.“‘Oii leave that thread,’ the kite owner would scold me. ‘Why do you pull my thread, leave it right now.’ But I’d continue pulling the threads as the owner continued shouting. Other times I caught the kites that had failed to fly and dropped on the ground.”The fallen kites got stuck in the buildings, trees or poles, or glided down in the open grounds or paddy fields. Falling kites from the Kathmandu core settled down in Tundikhel covering it. Oftentimes kites fell on the fields to rest upon the lush paddy nearing its harvest.“Children ran straight into the fields to catch the kite,” says Dibya. \"They destroyed the crops by stepping on them. Some farmers chased them, scolding along as they did so and if they caught anyone, they slapped them.”Love and restrictions on kiteAmidst the raging kite fights high up in the sky, there were apparently also some quieter kites lingering much lower among the buildings or tree lines, for their goals lay in not ruthlessly cutting the threads of other kites but piercing softly through the hearts of their owners' love interests. During the Rana regime, there were designated public spaces to fly kites, writes Gautam in his article. Referring to oral accounts, he writes that the Ranas were particularly careful to avoid kite flyers around their durbars. This is because love-stricken men tied letters to kites and flew them into the durbars to their love interests among the nanis.He writes that the kites could be flown mainly on the grounds of Chhauni. Anyone flying kites in any other place and around Rana durbars were arrested.Pant also recalls love-stricken boys from his time. “Just as kites came in different colours and patterns, so did kite flyers,” he writes in the article. “Some wrote love letters using a few words in “symbolic language” on a plain kite and attempted to land it on the rooftop of the girl they liked. Some simply landed their kites on any rooftop if a girl appeared there and waited for reaction.”King Tribhuvan among kite fliersPande writes in his book: “Once or twice during kite season every year, King Tribhuvan went to Chhauni to fly kites. Legend has it that if the line of the king’s kite was cut, it flew to Lhasa. But since anyone who caught that kite received five rupees, everyone attempted to catch that kite.”In 2021 news report ‘Bhawanle Chhekidiyo Changa Udaune Aakash’ by Shivahari Ghimire published in Nayapatrika, cultural expert the late Satyamohan Joshi also recounts that “During Dashain, Tribhuvan came to the ground below Swayambhu to fly kites. […] He did not use the same thread to fly kites twice.”In the same article, Joshi says that the King also went to Budhanilakantha to fly kites and participate in kite flying competitions.End of season, end of cultureMohan Krishna Shrestha, 86, was born in Budhanilakantha. Every year, on the day of Haribodhini Ekadashi, he saw the annual fair at the Budhanilakantha Temple. He also witnessed kite fliers gathered in the open fields around the Temple.“Oh, it’d be a lot of people,” says Shrestha. “They came from all around Bhaktapur, Kathmandu and Lalitpur.”They flew kites on Ekadashi, Dwadashi and some even until Purnima.“They took all the remaining threads and kites that had survived Dashain and flew the last kites of the season,” says Tuladhar. “I remember my uncles, relatives and neighbours going to Budhanilakantha with their kites.”Joshi recalls in the 2021 article that King Tribhuvan also went to Budhanilakantha with his sons Mahendra, Himalaya and Basundhara. He greatly supported and also participated in the competitions there organised by the commoners. If he liked he gave prize money to the winners.This annual event lost its glory days after the decline in the open fields as buildings began to rise with the establishment of Budhanilkantha School in 1972, Mohan says.“The event survived in some form until the 1990s,” he says.But what happened after that?The end-of-the-season event in the 1990s was also an indication of the end of the age-old kite tradition.“If I go to my ancestral place in Asan to fly kites, it’s not possible for me to do that today because there are buildings everywhere,” says Tuladhar. “Cityscapes and urbanisation have created the obstacle for flying kites.”Dibya does feel like flying kites sometimes.“No space to fly kites today,” he says. “In the old times, there were river banks and open fields. Even if you fly kites, it gets stuck in somebody's rooftop or water tank or somewhere.”Yesteryear’s kite enthusiasts believe that increasing means of entertainment was another reason for the decline of kite culture.“When television came, kite flying started to slowly decrease,” says Bibek. “And then mobile phones robbed kite flying even more.”And so, when his sister Sajani cranes her neck up in the sky today, she rarely sees a kite.“Those days we heard one chait after another,” she says. “These days you won’t hear a single chait.” \nIn 2008 Matina Shakya was only three years old when she was appointed as the Kumari of Kathmandu. She was succeeded by Trishna Shakya as the new Kumari in 2017.Kumaris are revered as goddesses of beauty and strength in certain Hindu and Buddhist traditions. Worshipping young girls as Kumaris is a 2,000-year-old practice in Nepal. Since the 13th century, when the Malla kings ruled, the Newars of the Kathmandu Valley have been worshipping Kumari, a girl from the Shakya/Bajracharya community chosen to embody the divine energy of goddess Taleju Bhawani. The reign of a Kumari ends when she starts menstruating. So long as she is serving as the Kumari, she is believed to be the nation’s divine protector, safeguarding it from evil. Matina, 18, is now in her first year of college, studying for a bachelor’s degree in management. Her father, Pratapman Shakya, when asked about having a daughter who is the only living the goddess in the world said, “Not having your own daughter live in the same house as you seemed a little unfair, but we feel very proud to call ourselves the parents of the royal Kumari who is revered by people all over the world.”On March 9, 2023, he, along with Matina, were getting ready for a special function held to honour all former Kumaris from across Nepal. “There are often events to honour Matina as she was the royal Kumari, but this one was dedicated to all former Kumaris from different areas. There are 129 living Kumaris in all,” he added. Besides Kathmandu, Kumari tradition is followed in Bhaktapur, Lalitpur, and Kirtipur, among other cities.According to him, this was the first time an event like this was organised and the Deputy Mayor of Kathmandu, Sunita Dangol, was also in attendance.Throughout the year, many people line up outside the ‘Kumari Ghar’ to get a chance to visit the Kumari and get her blessings. Many foreigners stand out in the yard to catch a glimpse of her. Nepali people believe that if a Kumari smiles at you, it is a bad omen.Everyday, a tutor visits the Kumari to help her continue with her education as she is not allowed to step outside the Kumari Ghar. She takes her exams and does her homework from the Kumari Ghar itself. She also has the freedom to play inside the Kumari Ghar. Many former kumaris have pursued careers in their fields of interest or studied after their term ends, and they continue to be treated with the same respect. The tradition of Kumari has evolved over time. In the past Kumaris did not enjoy these freedoms.Because of various superstitious beliefs, Kumaris were not fully educated and were forbidden from getting married because of the belief that the groom would die soon if he married an ex-Kumari. They led secluded lives, were restricted from participating in normal childhood activities, and focused solely on their religious duties.However, now, these myths have been dispelled. Modern understanding has shifted to recognise that Kumaris, after stepping down from their divine role, have the freedom to marry and lead a normal life. The perception of Kumaris as isolated figures has evolved, with a focus on providing them with a more balanced upbringing. There have been initiatives to integrate Kumaris into regular social and educational settings, allowing them to have a more holistic and fulfilling childhood experience. “Matina was already familiar with the students from the school that she attended after her term as Kumari ended,” said Shakya. “The kids visited the Kumari Ghar frequently so that she could have a smooth transition,” he added. According to Gautam Prasad Shakya, who has been living as a caretaker in the Kumari Ghar, the changes made to the tradition are minor. “The traditions of Kumari have mostly stayed the same. All the rituals are still practised like in the old days,” he said.On 6 May 2005, Pun Devi Maharjan, a lawyer, filed a case in the Supreme Court claiming that the traditional practice of electing young girls as Kumaris, or “goddesses’, who are expected to follow certain social restrictions and appear at religious festivals, violated the rights of the child. Quoting Maharjan’s complaint, Puskar Mathema writes in Yuwamanch Monthly of October 2007, “If Kumari tradition is continued, it will undermine the fundamental rights as well the freedoms of children guaranteed by the constitution and child rights treaties. Apart from this, it will have a negative impact on their physical and mental development.”The case continued while Nepal overthrew the monarchy and declared itself a secular state in 2007. When the judgement was pronounced in 2008, the goddess was still in her role, now giving blessings to the country’s President. The court ordered that the Kumaris and ex-Kumaris receive better benefits and arrangements and ordered the government to improve their support and allowances.In April 2006, Prof Chunda Bajracharya filed a petition at the Supreme Court against Maharjan’s petition, who had argued against the Kumari tradition. Bajracharya contended that the tradition should be preserved as heritage due to its over 100 years of history.“People who don’t understand the culture shouldn’t comment on it,” she stated. Bajracharya also criticised the human right activists who contended that Kumaris were only allowed to wear the colour red. “People who say Kumaris are forced to wear red clothing all the time, are the same people who send their kids to schools in uniform,” she said.“After the 2008 court verdict, there have been a lot of improvements. Now, a teacher visits the Kumari Ghar daily to tutor the Kumari, who is expected to complete school assignments and sit periodic exams. All the former Kumaris now get benefits like scholarships and special pensions,” she added.Bajracharya is currently a professor of literature at the Tribhuvan University in Kathmandu.“The only significant change that the court verdict brought to the tradition was in terms of her education,” said Gautam Prasad Shakya, the caretaker. “Kumaris were tutored long before the case, but the case helped formalise this arrangement. After the court verdict, the time between 12 pm and 4 pm was designated as the Kumari’s tuition time,” he added.After the verdict, there was a concerted effort to provide Kumaris with access to quality education, enabling them to develop the skills and knowledge needed to lead fulfilling lives beyond their divine roles. There was also a shift towards ensuring that the Kumari's living quarters are comfortable, safe, and conducive to her overall well-being.Moreover, the selection process for the Kumari underwent reforms in the aftermath of the Pun Devi Maharjan case. There was a push for greater transparency, accountability, and inclusivity in the selection of the Kumari, with an emphasis on ensuring that the process was fair, respectful, and free from undue influence.Efforts were made to support their transition into adulthood, including providing them with comprehensive resources for education, vocation, and social integration. This shift aimed to address the challenges faced by former Kumaris and empower them to lead independent and fulfilling lives after their divine service.“The Kumari tradition has evolved over time. During the tenure of my daughter, we saw a lot of improvements. Even after her time as Kumari, Matina continued to get a lot of government support,” said Shakya, former Kumari Matina’s father.“Some people argue that child rights are being violated, but all of her rights are being upheld inside the Kumari Ghar. This is a unique and respected aspect of Nepali culture, and I don’t believe it violates any of my child’s rights.”While the Kumari tradition continues, its practices have evolved. “She enjoys this normal life and it didn’t take her long to adjust as well,” says Matina’s father, on her transition from the revered Kumari to the ordinary Matina. \nWhat animals did Juddha Shumsher have in his zoo?“We only have records of animals from the mid-1960s,” says Ganesh Koirala, who has been employed at the Central Zoo for the past 36 years and currently serves as its information officer and programme officer. “That too I hand-copied from an old torn-down file that I came across.”Today, the Central Zoo, which sprawls across six hectares in Jawalakhel, Lalitpur, houses as many as 1,298 wild animals of different species of mammals, reptiles, fishes and birds from Nepal and around the world—from tiger, rhinoceros, hippopotamus and red panda to its recent attraction: a pair of chimpanzees.After enduring decades of neglect under various government bodies, with its animals and infrastructure scraping along in a deplorable state, the zoo received a new lease of life with improved infrastructure and animal care in 1995, when it came under the management of the King Mahendra Trust for Nature Conservation (KMTNC), now known as the National Trust for Nature Conservation, in 1995.Today, the Central Zoo is an entertainment venue, one of the most happening places in the Kathmandu valley. Flocked by thousands of daily visitors, the zoo now also hosts rescued animals and those in need of rehabilitation. It is also a site for conservation education.But when Juddha Shumsher Rana (prime minister from 1932–1945) built the Jawalakhel Zoological Garden on the premises of his Jawalakhel Durbar (where Nepal Administrative Staff College stands today) in 1932, he did so purely for private interests—as a space of entertainment and amusement for him and his family.Built in the semi-wilderness of Jawalakhel around a historical pond dating to the 17th century during the reign of King Siddhi Narsingh Malla, the zoo also became the space he could use to show his respect for two women he revered, his mother and sister-in-law, and indulge in one of his favourite pastimes—gambling.Today, the Central Zoo, nestled in the heart of Jawalakhel's sprawling crowd, does not go unnoticed, and its story is well told. But what passions drove Juddha to build the zoo? What was its original layout? What animals did it have in the beginning? And how did Juddha spend time there?“I remember once seeing a small board that read ‘Jawalakhel Zoological Garden’,” Koirala says. “I don’t know whether it was from Juddha’s time or was made in the later years. It must surely be that Juddha built the zoo out of influence from the British given how this term was used by them.”Koirala adds, “There is a former employee, now an elderly gentleman who worked in the zoo in the 1960s. He surely has some stories from Juddha’s time.”Birds, beasts and palacesTo trace the birth of Jawalakhel Zoological Garden, one has to look at the history of Nepal’s rulers owning birds and animals.Like rulers around the world, Nepal’s royalty kept wild and exotic birds and animals in captivity as a source of pleasure and mark of wealth and power. The book ‘Social History of Nepal’ by historians TR Vaidya, Tri Ratna Manandhar and Shankar Lal Joshi details how Mallas during the mediaeval Kathmandu Valley to Ranas and Shahs in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries owned rare, exotic creatures. In 1708, a rhinoceros in Kathmandu Valley broke the iron chain in which it was bound and killed its tamer. In 1714, Bhaktapur’s King Bhupatindra Malla gifted a camel and an elephant to Kantipur’s King Bhaskar Malla to build peace.Among Shahs, King Rana Bahadur Shah in particular was reputed for his collection of birds and animals. He also owned a zoo outside his palace in Basantapur Durbar Square, where the Nepal Bank Limited stands in New Road today. The zoo contained “tiger, bear, monkey, elephant, horse, deer… heron, peacock… pigeon, wild dogs, rabbits, rats, mongoose.”Jung Bahadur Rana’s zoo on the premises of his Thapathali Durbar hosted a variety of birds and animals collected during his hunting expeditions as well as those brought from abroad. Jung Bahadur himself used to “supervise and inspect it”. Juddha Shumsher likewise had his own collection of creatures which steadily expanded into a zoological garden. Seeking wilderness in his Jawalakhel DurbarJuddha’s biographer Ishwari Prasad writes in ‘The Life and Times of Maharaja Juddha Shumsher Jung Bahadur Rana’ that between 1933 and 1940, Juddha shot 433 tigers, 33 rhinoceros and 93 leopards. An insatiable big-game hunter, Juddha had a deep fondness for being in the wild and among wild animals, and from this came, according to oral history prevalent among members of Kathmandu’s Rana community including Juddha’s descendants, the desire to own a zoo.Built in 1752, Schönbrunn Zoo in Vienna, the world’s first modern zoo, was already over 100 years old when Juddha was born in 1875. London Zoo opened in 1828 and Alipore Zoological Garden (Kolkata Zoo) in 1875. Nawab Wajid Ali Shah Zoological Garden (Lucknow Zoo) was established in 1921. Juddha’s inspiration, his descendants say, was most likely reinforced by his tours to zoological gardens during his visits to England in 1908 and to different Indian cities.An article titled ‘Central zoo in state of neglect’ published in The Kathmandu Post in 1996 says that Juddha one day “received a pair of leopards as a gift”, cementing his desire to own a zoo. A report ‘Central Zoo Master Plan’ prepared by the KMTNC in 1996 says that Juddha decided to build a zoo in an epiphany when he saw that some animals “including deer, a few rhinos, and some tigers had been collected from the Tarai and kept in Kathmandu” could be put into one compound in the “lonely piece of land with a large 16th [sic] century Malla period Pokhari”.The pond lay still and serene surrounded by green wilderness ever since Patan’s King Siddhi Narsingh Malla built it in the 1600s. On the grounds surrounding this pond, the Newars from Na:Tole, Pulchowk and surroundings had their devisthans where, for centuries, they gathered to perform their religious ceremonies during Basanta Panchami and Bhoto Jatra even after this area fell within the Jawalakhel Durbar.For the palace, the ground served as its extended garden along with a horse and elephant stable. Subodh Rana, 69, grandson of Juddha Shumsher, recalled his father Kiran Shumsher telling him that Juddha and his family sometimes also used the scenic grounds for picnics. If there was any spot where Juddha wanted to build a menagerie, it would be around this Pokhari (pond). One day, he called his grandson General Maheshwar Shumsher Rana and deputed him to the task of doing just this.The zoo’s layout—except for the small plots of lands acquired later—that was in place when it came under KMTNC's management was, the present and retired zoo officials believe, mostly the same as it was built by Maheshwar and so offers a peek into how Juddha’s zoo must have been like. Pond in the middle of the ground surrounded by enclosures—the southern bank housing mainly larger animals, and cages for birds positioned on the northern banks.From pigeons to the king of the jungleWhat animals and birds did the enclosures at Juddha’s zoo house?“We cannot tell for sure,” Koirala says.Once it came under government ownership, the zoo was tossed from one institution to the other for lack of interest and knowledge on the right institution to manage it. Amid all this chaos, documents were possibly lost and the zoo has no concrete record about the animals that Juddha must have once taken amusement at, said Koirala.Mukti Narayan Shrestha, 82, a retired secretary of the Nepal government, joined the Central Zoo in 1970 as a veterinarian when many original structures of the zoo were still intact. Shrestha also worked with an elderly khardar who, he says, was employed in the zoo since the time of Juddha and was about to retire when he joined.“In those days where the purpose of menageries was exclusively for exhibition and pleasure with no regard for the welfare and recreation of animals and birds, the cages were tiny and iron-barred,” Shrestha says.Elephant, horses, deer, monkeys, tiger, rhinoceros, clouded leopard, red panda, bear, palm civet (nir biralo), four-horned antelope, Himalayan goral, pheasants, Himalayan monal—from the mythical and the majestic, the gentle and friendly to the fiery and ferocious, Juddha’s zoo boasted them all, Shrestha says.Shrestha’s account is not different from the anecdotes passed down to other retired and present zoo officials and the members of the Rana community, who also detail the rare and the exotic fauna, like the gharial crocodile and porcupine, even the jungle’s king—creatures, they say, that Juddha must have received from foreigners as gifts—appearing alongside domestic birds like pigeons.Tidbits of published information also confirm that the zoo had a good collection of exotic birds and animals from Nepal and abroad. One such suggestion comes from Kalyan Shumsher’s ‘Shree Teen Juddha Mahima’ published during Juddha’s reign in 1943.“One need not travel abroad to see the incredible birds and animals found in foreign countries,” he writes. “It will suffice to see [those creatures] right here in the zoo opened by His Holiness Shree 3 [Juddha] in Jawalakhel.”Among these incredible creatures, one reigned supreme—lion, the king of the jungle.For one, it would not have satiated Juddha to build a zoo and not have the jungle’s king exhibited in it. Juddha hence must have done everything possible to ensure one for the zoo. Infrastructure at the zoo suggests that the lion indeed lived at Juddha’s zoo or, in the least, during the Rana regime.“Where bear habitat lies today, there were two dome-shaped attached enclosures with a holding room, constructed in the classic architecture that many enclosures in the British zoos had in the past. They had brick walls and lime plaster,” Koirala says. “These were built to house a lion in one cage and a tiger in the other.”Near these enclosures stood another cage that remains intact today, with the head of a roaring lion carved out of the wall on the top of its iron bars. Zoo officials as well as members of the Rana community believe that Juddha had this exhibit built to specifically house a lion.Remarkably, these Juddha-era infrastructural spaces are corroborated by a rare piece of photographic evidence. A 1946 photo of the zoo shows a lion while a Kathmandu mother and her sons stand in front of its cage.Juddha’s place of piety and playThe zoo was not merely a space that Juddha sought out for amusement and retreat in the outpost of his palace; he also used this place to express his deepest affection.This affection spills right at the zoo’s entrance, in the form of the life-size statue of Karma Kumari Devi, wife of Juddha’s elder brother and Rana Prime Minister Dev Shumsher. Karma Kumari stands tall in her regal costume shaded by a wide canopy. Juddha revered Karma Kumari because it was she who raised him and looked after his mother Juhar Kumari Devi after the death of his father Dhir Shumsher. On another prominent part of the zoo on the south-east, Juhar Kumari’s enthroned statue overlooks the pond. Juddha had commissioned the London-based sculptor Domenico Antonio Tonelli to cast these statues.When Karma Kumari’s statue was unveiled is not clear, but Juhar Kumari’s statue was unveiled by Juddha amid a grand function in 1935 on Jawalakhel’s most auspicious day, Bhoto Jatra. It was attended by the British Resident Frederick Bailey.“On June 28, 1935, at Jawalakhel Durbar… the pond nearby looked very scenic,” says a Gorkhapatra news report titled ‘Statue installation’ dated July 5, 1935. “Because it was the day of Bhoto Jatra of Machhindranath… and moreover since an ideal woman’s statue was being unveiled, there was a crowd of lakhs of people.”Less than fifty metres from Karma Kumari’s statue stands a one-story building with a pagoda roof that today serves as the zoo’s meeting hall. Juddha, an avid gambler, found the scenic semi-wilderness covered in trees and filled with the sounds of wildlife to be a perfect place to relish the game. So he built a building with twelve doors on its four sides allowing him and his fellow gambling compatriots the freedom to enter through a particular door that they thought would bring luck. He called it his Juwa Ghar, the gambling house, and built it with the sole purpose of indulging in the game he loved. Roar of lion reverberates in KathmanduThe sounds of the animals and birds in the zoo rose up in the Jawalakhel sky. Every day, until much later in the 1970s, roar of the zoo’s lion (there were later other lions) diffused to far corners of the Valley, merging the zoo with the spirit of Kathmandu and informing the city folks of its presence.But was the zoo open to the public as well?“I think once it was built, the zoo was open for the public,” Subodh Rana said. “It is unlikely that Juddha Shumsher built such a large zoo and kept it only for his family.”For one, Kalyan Shumsher mentioning that one “need not travel abroad to see the incredible birds and animals found in foreign countries” suggests that the public had at least some access to the zoo. Of course, the Newar community from Na:Tole, Pulchowk and surrounding areas were permitted inside the zoo on the days of their guthi functions on Basanta Panchami and Bhoto Jatra.As the zoo was established at the back of the ground where Bhoto Jatra celebrations happen, it naturally filled with revellers on this day in addition to the guthi ritual observers as testified by the Gorkhapatra report. The photo of the mother and her sons also bear testimony that the zoo was not entirely closed to the public.What is widely believed, though, is that the zoo officially came under government ownership after Nepal became a democracy in 1951. And it would still be a few more years before it was open to the public in 1956.In 1945, Juddha gave up his power and eventually retired in Dehradun, India, where he died in 1952. With time, Jawalakhel Zoological Garden became the Central Zoo. It would take many avatars—a neglected site of crammed, unmaintained cages with sad eyes of emaciated creatures staring from behind the bars, a focal point of animal diplomacy, particularly during the period of monarchy, to, in its recent decades, a space of conservation and education.When all this was happening, the city sprawled around Jawalakhel, subduing the lion’s roar with its noise. More wildlife from around the country and the world came—creatures captured from the wild, those sold by circuses, those rescued from traffickers. Fate would bring these creatures to the care of generations of Kathmandu folks, intertwining each other’s joys and sorrows. After the tale of Juddha’s Jawalakhel Zoological Garden, there would be these stories to tell. Sitting around a table inside Juddha’s Juwa Ghar, Koirala and other zoo officials begin unfolding these stories before me. \nNepal’s book market is no stranger to the popular Bangladeshi-Swedish writer Taslima Nasrin. Almost all of her books have been translated into Nepali, but Nasrin herself says that they are all unauthorised translations. “All books [Nepali translations] are pirated versions,” Nasrin told the Post in a Whatsapp conversation. Nasrin, who is currently in exile in India after facing death threats in Bangladesh following the publication of her novel Lajja (Shame), said that she or her publishers have never allowed anyone the right to translate her books into Nepali. “I don’t know of any such Nepali publishers. No one asked for permission and no one has paid [me] royalty.”Translating and publishing books without permission from authors or publishers is a punishable crime. But Nepal’s book market is full of such unauthorised translations and prints of books written by the who’s who of the world literature. Such endeavours haven’t just hurt the authors but also the readers, says Ajit Baral, publisher of the Kathmandu-based Fineprint publication. “These translations are poor,” Baral says. “Tomes with 1200–1300 pages have been trimmed to 200–300 pages. An example is the biography of Bill Clinton.”Another popular book that has seen unauthorised Nepali translation is the biography of Steve Jobs by Walter Isaacson.“We have no official deal in place for a [Nepali] translation of Steve Jobs,” Peppa Mignone, associate agent of the CAA, the translation authority of the biography, said in an email interview with the Post.The book’s Nepali translation is published by Panchpokhari Publication House. The translated book identifies the translator thus: “Achyut Koirala, who has a master’s in English literature, is primarily a journalist. He is currently affiliated with Nagarik daily. He keeps a close tab on international history, politics and culture and has written scripts and dialogues for half a dozen Nepali films. He has published over a dozen non-fiction books.”Koirala, who admits to the unauthorised translation, claims that he hasn’t just translated the book but has also done ‘creative writing’ with it.‘Rich Dad Poor Dad’, written by Robert Kiyosaki and Sharon Lechter, is among the books that’s perennially on the bestseller list across the world. Upon investigation, the Post found three Nepali translations of the book—all unauthorised. One of them is translated by Dilip Kumar Shrestha and published by the same firm, the Panchpokhari Publication House. Another Nepali iteration of the book is published by Book For All publication and translated by Kopila MD. Yet another Nepali version is translated by one Sudheer Dixit and published by Plata Publication, Kathmandu.In an email conversation with the Post, Ronson Taylor, who oversees the international rights at The Rich Dad Company, said, “At this point in time, we do not have a relationship with an established publisher in the [Nepali] language market. If there are any Rich Dad Poor Dad books currently for sale in the Nepali market, they are pirated.”Basanta Thapa, a writer and translator, says that many books are being translated of late to make easy money. “But how would the quality of these unauthorised translations be!” Thapa wonders. “Readers who haven’t read the original wouldn’t know the faults in the translated versions.” Thapa says that any translator worth his salt aims to ‘recreate’ a book and it takes much work to do that.Taslima’s books are the major victimsTaslima’s memoir Uttal Hawa has been translated into Nepali as ‘Sangharsha’, literally Struggle, and is published by Khoji Publication House. Even though the book in its cover claims that it is an authorised translation from the English version Wild Wind, it is a pirated one. The book is translated by Bikash Basnet and edited by Bhogiraj Chamling. A revised version of the book is edited by Sangeet Srota (Yam Bahadur Chhetri).The same publication house has also published the Nepali translation of the book’s sequel as ‘Prem ra Jeevan’. Publisher Sushil Chalise says that while he is aware that one needs to receive permission from the author or the publisher to translate a book, his efforts to contact Taslima were unsuccessful. Therefore, he had published the version the translator made available to him. Translator Basnet, too, admits he translated the book without Taslima’s permission. “About a decade back, we didn’t know how to ask for permission,” he said.Nepal has the Copyright Act (2002) in place. Before it, there was the The Patent, Design and Trade Mark Act, 2022 (1965) that included intellectual property in its 2006 revision. Even the Muluki Ain (Civil Code) of 1910 BS had a provision about copyright. Moreover, it goes without saying that translating somebody else’s work without permission is immoral.Likewise, Indigo Ink Pvt Ltd has published a Nepali translation of Taslima’s anthology of essays No Country for Women as ‘Aaimai ko Kunai Desh Chhaina’. The book is translated by Krishna Giri and edited by Pramod Pradhan. “I have no idea about the agreement between the publisher and translator,” Pradhan, who is also a children’s book writer, says. “I just copy-edited it upon request.”Bishnukumar Poudel, publisher of Indigo Ink, however, claims that he is still trying to take translation rights for the book. “We translated the book long ago,” he says. “We are still trying to get translation rights.”Indigo is also publishing unauthorised translations under its imprints All Book Store Pvt Ltd, Book for All and Plata Publication. It has published two versions of Rich Dad Poor Dad under those shadow imprints. But Plata Publication is not registered in the Company Registrar’s Office.Pradhan says that many foreign books have had unauthorised translations in Nepali and their quality is poor. Those books are translated not from the original language but from a second or third language, so these translations are bound to have problems, he says. “After I learned that those were unauthorised translations, I have stopped editing them,” Pradhan said.Indian author Shiv Khera’s You Can Win has been translated into Nepali by Bloomsbury India and has granted the distribution rights to Ekta Books. But the book’s unauthorised translations are also found in the market and they don’t even mention the name of the publisher and translator. What is interesting is they mention that it’d be illegal to republish the book, or an excerpt of it, without the author’s permission.The Nepali translation of the book, which was poorly written and rife with inaccuracies, had landed the publisher at court. After a complaint was filed at the District Court Kathmandu in 2066BS on the charge that the publisher violated the copyrights and economic rights, the court had issued a verdict on Mangsir 11 that year, charging a fine of Rs10,000, Rs20,000 and Rs30,000 to the defendants Netra Prasad Pokharel, Narayan Prasad Bhusal, and Bhagwati Risal and Bishnu Silwal, respectively.Baral, the Fineprint publisher, says that international publishers wouldn’t demand much for translation rights given Nepal’s small market, but Nepali publishers do not bother to reach out to them. “Publishers who put out unauthorised translations and sell them at 50 percent discount have troubled publishers like us,” he said.Fineprint has published authorised translated versions of books such as Leaving Microsoft to Change the World by John Wood, Healed by Manisha Koirala, and Hippie by Paulo Coelho. The publication house is also set to release the Nepali translation of Israeli historian Yuval Noah Harari’s bestseller Sapiens. Translated into Nepali by Dinesh Kafle, the book’s translation right was acquired at the cost of USD1300, Baral said. Likewise, the publication acquired the translation rights of Sadhguru’s Inner Engineering at IRS93,000, he added.Baral says that publication of unauthorised translations is an immoral and illegal work. “This phenomenon not just hampers Nepal’s fledgling book publishing industry but also tarnishes the country’s reputation in the global market,” Baral said.Thapa, the writer and translator, points out the lack of regulatory mechanisms in the country. “We don’t have an agency that regulates the quality of translations being done,” he says. “Nobody compares the translation with the original. We need a dedicated authority to enhance the quality of translation.” Universities, Nepal Academy and other stakeholders can play a role to uplift the translation sector, he adds.One’s pain, another’s pleasureWhen the author Suketu Mehta was travelling through Mumbai, a young man approached him with a handful of books while his vehicle was stuck in traffic. Brandishing Maximum City, written by none other than Mehta himself, the young man requested the author to buy a copy. Suketu leafed through the book and said, “This is a pirated copy and I’m the author of this book.” The youth wasn’t bothered and replied, “Okay, you can buy it at a discount.”This anecdote was shared to the Post by Mehta’s friend, the author and professor Amitava Kumar, in an email exchange.Most of these pirated books are imported into Nepal from India while the retailers of original books are finding themselves increasingly in trouble. “We sell original copies but many readers doubt us as well, given the ubiquity of pirated versions,” says Anjan Shrestha, operator of Education Book House, Jamal.Ramchandra Timothy, chair of Thapathali-based Ekta Books Pvt Ltd, said that the phenomenon of piracy has tarnished Nepal’s image internationally. “There was a time when Bangladesh would be known as ‘piracy king’,” he said. “Now there's a risk Nepal would take the crown.”As tax increases, so does piracyThe government decision to impose a 10 percent tax on book imports in fiscal year 2019-20 led to a proliferation of pirated book markets, booksellers say. After the decision, booksellers started to cut back on imports and that led to the entry of a new crop of pirated booksellers, a trader in Kathmandu says. But following widespread backlash, then finance minister Bishnu Paudel struck down the policy.“After the government’s decision, we stopped importing books for a while,” says Shrestha of Education Books. “The import of books went down for about two years. Then the pirates stepped in to fill the gap. It was about that time that pirated copies of biographies and memoirs of Obamas and Jai Shettys became omnipresent in the market.”Pirated copies of classics by Roald Dahl and JK Rowling also made an entry in the Nepali market. Then the phenomenon only saw a rise.Since the customs department does not levy duty on foreign books and also does not care to differentiate between the pirated and original copies, unauthorised books have found a safe haven in Nepali market.The government doesn’t levy any customs duty on books and newspapers published by foreign publishers abroad. The importers should only pay Rs565 at the customs points. But Nepali publishers have to pay 10 percent tax to import books printed in India.James Taylor, director of Communications and Freedom to Publish of the International Publishers Association, says that the government, publishers, writers and readers should join hands to control widespread piracy. “The government should realise that book publishing and reading culture contribute to the country’s economy as well,” he said, adding that the government should seize pirated books and close websites that sell pirated ebooks.Nandan Jha, executive vice chair of Penguin Random House India’s sales, production and business department, says that piracy has emerged as a big challenge for publishers of late and has harmed the authors, publishers, distributors, printers, readers and other stakeholders. “To confront piracy, all the stakeholders should launch a special joint effort,” Jha told the Post in an email exchange.Piracy has proliferated in the Nepali market to such an extent that the publishers of such books and unauthorised translations keep whatever ISBN numbers they like, often conflicting with other books, and still get off scot free. If scanned or searched on the internet, the ISBN number gives details on the author of the book, what the book is about, and its price, among others.Bijay Sharma, information officer at TU Library, says, “Keeping ISBN number at one’s will is illegal. If anyone files a complaint, we can punish them.”By the lawThe Muluki Ain-1910 BS had mandated that a publisher take permission of Gorkha Bhasa Prakashini Samiti before publishing any material. The Copyrights Act came into effect in 2022 BS and was amended in 2054 BS. In 2059 BS, a new Act was promulgated and it is still effective now. Authorities are currently working to amend the Act to give the registrar’s office more autonomy regarding copyright.According to the 2059 BS Act, copyright violations are considered government cases. In such cases, plaintiffs should file a complaint with the police. The Act’s clause 25 has various conditions that amount to violation of copyright. The Act’s subclause A says that if a publisher produces or copies material in writing or sound and sells or distributes it, it amounts to violation of copyright.Likewise, the Act’s clause 26 prevents selling of unauthorised material. The clause restricts the ‘importation of copies of work or sound recording, either made in a foreign country or sourced otherwise, into Nepal for business purpose shall not be permitted if preparation of such copies would be considered illegal if they were prepared in Nepal.’If anyone infringes upon protected rights, they are liable to punishment but the provision’s implementation remains lax.The law gives the authority to district court to take legal action against copyright violators.Advocate Parshuram Koirala says that if the government becomes more proactive, it can punish violators on the basis of the 2059 BS Act and thereby control the phenomenon of intellectual theft and copyright violations. “Creation is a crucial part of humanity’s benefit,” he says. “If intellectual property is not protected effectively, then there’d be no inspiration to create something.”Bal Bahadur Mukhiya, a professor at Nepal Law Campus, suggests the inclusion of rules about digital piracy in law, and also the clauses of various related international treaties and agreements that Nepal is part of.“In the US, a teacher or professor should pay a certain revenue even to photocopy a chapter of some text for teaching purposes,” Mukhiya says. “But in Nepal, those who photocopy an entire book and sell it go scot free.”(This report is prepared in collaboration with the Centre for Investigative Journalism, Nepal.) \nThe pre-1990 generation would remember quite well what the government press considered newsworthy back then. At a time when the private electronic media was non-existent, the entire nation was forced to hear or watch the ritualistic recounting of every action of members of the royal family, starting, of course, with the head honcho himself. Thus, after invariably informing us about the king’s having felicitated or condoled, as the case may be, the president of a country we would have had no prior dealings or any since, we would be expected to be enthused by the news that another such country had supported the king’s still-born ‘zone of peace’ proposal. Next would come the scintillating development that the queen had visited a temple while a princess received a consignment of donated medicines and another attended a diplomatic party. Only after having enlightened us about the everyday royal doings would we learn about floods having swept away scores in the Tarai or a diarrhoeal outbreak having struck down whole villages in the west. It was no better in print except that, given the format, one could find the real news on the front page, albeit buried somewhere in the blaze of royal doings, with the only giveaway being the headline in bold italics.One could hence be pardoned for the sense of déjà vu in the run-up to Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli’s US visit to attend the UN General Assembly this past month. Publication after publication (and I’m sure that was the case with the radio and TV outlets) went on about each and every detail of how the prime minister was going to keep himself busy in New York. Perhaps because nothing substantial was likely to be achieved in New York, read, a meeting with the Indian prime minister, Oli’s office tried to highlight every aspect of his upcoming trip.That Oli would face an almost-empty auditorium at the UN was only to be expected since leaders from countries like ours speak only for the record and not to actually influence global policy one way or another. Fortunately for Oli, a meeting with Narendra Modi did materialise eventually, and he was also able to catch up with a few others who had most likely been fishing around for tête-à-têtes as well.What stood out was that the pre-visit reporting made it sound like the primary purpose of Oli’s trip half-way around the world was to speak at Columbia and Harvard universities, and his attending the annual UN jamboree was only incidental. In fact, one newspaper actually headlined the university visits in this manner, “Prime Minister Oli will address Columbia and Harvard universities”, and, began the story with: “Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli, who is coming to America to participate in the 79th General Assembly of the United Nations (UN), will address Columbia University in New York and Harvard University in Boston.”The breathless tone suggests that if not the governing boards, at least the presidents of these universities had cogitated long and hard on who should be invited to speak at their university this year. And, as it so happened, both elite institutions homed in on no other than our prime minister and accordingly invited him to grace the university premises. Enticing as that scenario might sound to those of a nationalist bent, that would be quite far from the truth. Events at such universities as in any other, and there are always countless such at any given time, are generally initiated by a student body, a member of the faculty or a group of students or even just one, and also at times in response to feelers sent out by diplomatic missions in the case of foreign leaders.At Columbia, Oli was invited to speak at the World Leaders Forum. This is a series that appears to come alive mostly around the time of the UN General Assembly, taking advantage of Columbia’s location in the same city with leaders like Oli more than happy to oblige. The Harvard talk was part of the JFK Jr Forum, but being placed far away from New York, the emphasis appears less on world leaders. The day before had seen a group discussion on ‘Building a Digital Democracy’ while the one with the Ecuadorian president had been cancelled. The day following the Oli do was just a watch party to talk about the American vice-presidential debate. And that was just the JFK Jr Forum; on the day of Oli’s interaction, 38 other events were taking place at Harvard.I will not join many others in criticising Oli’s performance. I should say he did creditably well while reading from the teleprompter or the printed page although neither of his deliveries contained anything newsworthy. It was his nonanswers and the senseless or fudged ones during the Q&A that had people riled up, but by now, they should have known better than to expect anything but wisecracks from Oli in lieu of reasoned thought. That he had to deliver his homilies in English was a problem, but he made himself understood. I suppose the only revelation was that Oli’s interlocutor at Columbia, Jenik Radon, an Adjunct Professor there, was a ‘key drafter’ of the 2007 Interim Constitution, a fact that would surely come as news to the 16 members of the Constitution Drafting Committee.What bugs me is how Oli was both visibly humbled and honoured to speak at Columbia and Harvard. There is no need to belabour the hypocrisy of someone moved to such emotions is the same one who has done and would do practically nothing to improve the quality of Nepal’s institutions of learning. Former education minister Sumana Shrestha pointed out the irony of Oli speaking at the two universities when he himself was ‘a staunch advocate to get students, professors, teachers, university administration including [the] bureaucracy to take political party membership. Nepal’s higher education has been defunct due to partisan politics’.The greater irony is that the same Oli, who goes around bashing everything and everyone he does not like as inspired by foreign sources, could not but try and seek legitimacy for himself and his ‘theories’ at the very fount of knowledge where many ideas antithetical to his worldview are generated. What else can explain the constant harping about what were touted to be Oli’s supposedly masterly expositions at Columbia and Harvard? That, I believe, is the greater tragedy. But only if Oli and those who think like him would be willing to concede as much.  \nWhile artificial intelligence (AI) promises immense benefits, it also imposes tremendous risks. Some of them—accelerating misinformation, sophisticated cyber attacks, and soaring energy consumption—have already arrived. Others, including super-intelligent machines that take decisions independently of human oversight, are likely still a few years away. Although awareness about these risks is growing, many others have yet to be defined. And for all the incalculable opportunities afforded by AI, especially in developing countries, it is risky business.Concerns are mounting about the ways in which the rapid adoption of AI will negatively impact societies, including in the Global South. Last year my Institute together with New America convened a Global Task Force made up of AI specialists from across the Americas, Africa, and Asia to review ways to improve AI safety and alignment. And in 2024, the task force issued a primer to practically mitigate risks and improve resilience while also closing governance and regulatory gaps between the Global North and South.AI risksOne of the most significant risks the group identified is mass automation and job displacement. AI is expected to impact vast numbers of workers across sectors ranging from agriculture, manufacturing, retail to the law, medicine, finance. While new forms of employment will undoubtedly emerge, the jobs of up to 800 million people are at risk of automation by 2030, including 300 million in wealthy countries. The International Labor Organization estimates that over 56 percent of all jobs in low- and middle-income countries are at “high risk” of automation. Without safeguards in place, this could sharpen economic inequality and exclude low-skilled workers.Another risk involves deepening digital divides and sharpening inequality. The gap between those who can access advanced technologies and those who cannot is expected to widen over the coming years, leading to lower productivity, reduced economic growth, and greater social and economic inequality. This is particularly so in lower and middle-income settings already facing shortfalls in digital talent and related services.Biases and discrimination are another risk associated with AI. Advanced technologies and models designed in the US, China, and EU can perpetuate and amplify biases already present in the training data. This can lead to discriminatory outcomes in everything from credit scores to policing. It can also result in unfair exclusion from opportunities in the job market, credit and loans, and health services due to biassed algorithms.The intensification of surveillance and privacy violations are also enabled by AI. The integration of AI into everything from smart cities to law enforcement can infringe on privacy, civil liberties, and human rights. This is especially so in countries with weaker democratic institutions. Indeed, authoritarian regimes are already deploying AI-enabled systems to track political opponents, suppress dissent, and target marginalised communities based on ethnic, religious, or ideological grounds.What is more, the reliance of foreign technologies and expertise also constitutes a risk in the Global South. The over-dependence on US, Chinese and European innovations can potentially reduce the incentives to build domestic tech sectors in lower-income settings. It can also degrade the bargaining power of local governments, contributing to higher costs for technology while reducing control over standards. Dependence on foreign suppliers can also result in data being more easily accessed, controlled, manipulated and exploited by foreign actors, raising concerns about privacy, property theft, and integrity of critical infrastructure.Emerging solutionsGiven all these risks, what are some of the solutions being considered in the Global South? For one, there is a growing chorus for more involvement of developing country governments and experts in the formulation of global standards. This is a call echoed in a recent 2024 UN General Assembly resolution on AI inclusion and a recently agreed Digital Compact intended to overcome digital, data and innovation divides. A consensus is emerging to ensure that AI is more equitable, inclusive, and sensitive to the specific challenges of the Global South.Practically, more investment in education and vocational training is essential to prepare for coming automation and job losses. This requires developing training centres and online courses, retraining grants, job placement services, and progressive unemployment benefits as well as universal basic income (UBI) schemes. And promising examples are emerging: India’s AI for All initiative, Rwanda’s digital ambassadors, and Brazil’s Conecta program are all helping people and companies transition to the digital economy. And countries as varied as Kenya, Namibia and India are piloting UBI, though more action is needed.Public and private actors will need to dramatically scale investment in digital infrastructure to redress digital divides across the Global South. This includes expanding internet access and broadband access to the 2.6 billion people who are still not connected. Policies that promote digital hubs, equitable access to digital services and lost-cost technology programs are essential. One example of how to amplify such activities is Smart Africa Alliance’s AI for Development (AI4D) program which is building ethical AI frameworks for governance, agriculture and healthcare.Bias and discrimination can be minimised through improved guidance and standards for AI development and deployment. Countries, companies, and digital activists need to craft and enforce regulatory frameworks that mandate algorithmic transparency and regular audits. There are also major opportunities to mandate that data used to train AI systems is more diverse and representative. The Global Task Force identified close to 700 such strategies, albeit over two thirds formulated in wealthy countries suggesting that more work needs to be done to close the gap.Curbing surveillance and privacy violations requires robust data protection and privacy laws to safeguard personal information. The European Union and countries like Brazil, India, Kenya, South Africa, and Tanzania, are developing agile regulatory frameworks tailored to their specific realities. There also needs to be clear regulation governing the use of AI for surveillance to minimise invasive practices as well as public awareness campaigns together with advocacy from civil society for stronger protections.And reducing over-dependence on foreign technology providers requires investment in local AI policy and research, alongside grants and incentives for local accelerators, start-ups and labs. International partnerships and collaboration also play a key role, such as programs to skill-up law makers and civil servants led by ITU, UNESCO, UNDP- as do dedicated centres for workforce training and education provided by groups such as Google, Intel, and Microsoft.Measures to reduce AI risks must address the gaping AI governance divide between the Global North and South. This gap is expressed not just in terms of data scientists and data centres, but also in terms of regulation. A key priority involves stepping-up the participation of Global South decision-makers and experts in AI policy development, including in the G20 and OECDcontexts. Notwithstanding legitimate concerns with regulatory fragmentation, AI governance frameworks also need to be aligned with local contexts. The recently agreed AI Strategy and Digital Transformation Strategy established by the African Union offers promising signposts.The good news is that a recent UN Resolution on Inclusive AI, High-Level Panel on AI, and Global Digital Compact are charting a positive path forward. The compact calls explicitly for more inclusive AI policy development, the standing-up of an independent scientific panel on AI, and a global dialogue to anchor AI in human rights. Perhaps most important, it also recommends the launch of a global fund to support digital infrastructure and skills development. Such a fund will need to make big bets (similar to those set out in private-led initiatives such as the recent fund launched by IBM and Blackrock if it is to help close the AI governance and capabilities gap.—The ConversationRead the original article here. \nThe academic community in Nepal has been buzzing with discussions about research and publishing for quite some time now. This trend is noticeable, especially with the rise of academic institutions—business schools in particular—that have established research centres to support both faculty and students. Many of these institutions highlight their research endeavours on their websites. Furthermore, independent research and consulting organisations that claim to undertake high-quality research have proliferated in the country. Upon reviewing their reports, it becomes apparent that many are simply collections of facts, lacking in-depth analysis and scientific rigour. These documents appear more like consulting assignments aimed at meeting client demands quickly rather than fostering genuine knowledge creation. Although they may superficially resemble research, they do not possess the rigorous standards characterising true scientific inquiry.Disconnect between academia and industryAs a coordinator of the academia-industry interface at a business school, I frequently interact with clients who approach us with research requests. Many of these domestic and international clients demonstrate a surprising lack of understanding of the research process. For example, I once had a conversation with a representative from an international organisation who wanted us to conduct a national-level study involving a mixed-method research design—within two or three months. This unrealistic expectation reflects a broader misconception among many clients that research is quick and inexpensive work when it is a complex, time-consuming process that requires significant resources.The misunderstanding extends to domestic clients as well. Often, they request research work at the last minute, either because they have leftover funds to spend or because they need documentation for their ongoing projects. These clients fail to realise that research is about \"searching again\"—a meticulous process of exploration and discovery aimed at generating new knowledge or enhancing existing theories. It cannot be rushed. Professionals often view research as gathering information without appreciating the systematic methods and discipline necessary for conducting scientific investigations.State of scientific research The government's investment in research is alarmingly low. Nepal spends approximately 0.03 percent of its GDP on research and development, with only 0.011 percent of the education sector's budget allocated to innovation. This figure is minuscule compared to what is required to foster a vibrant research culture. In the most recent budget, Rs197.29 billion was allocated to the Ministry of Education, Science, and Technology (MoEST), which included a plan to establish a fund dedicated to research and innovation of Rs1 billion. Considering Rs1 billion, it effectively comes to 0.01 percent of GDP for research alone. The government also aimed to promote research and capacity development in institutions affiliated with Tribhuvan University, such as Centre for Economic Development and Administration (CEDA), Research Centre for Educational Innovation and Development (CERID), and Centre for Nepal and Asian Studies (CNAS). However, despite these announcements, only a few initiatives have come to fruition.There are many reasons for the lack of research output. First, for many academics, research is simply a requirement for promotion. Faculty members are often burdened with administrative responsibilities, leaving little time for meaningful research. This issue is not unique to Nepal but is a global challenge. Second, findings from research are primarily shared with a select group of subscribers or funding bodies, limiting their impact and visibility. There is a growing need for research to be more widely disseminated and reach the broader public.Third, there is a lack of support for researchers. PhD aspirants in Nepal face additional financial barriers. Unlike in many other countries, where PhD students receive full funding, students in Nepal often have to pay tuition fees, discouraging many from pursuing advanced research. The government and universities must provide better financial support for PhD students to ensure that talented researchers do not leave the country searching for better opportunities abroad.Barriers faced by academiciansMany Nepali universities do not prioritise quality publications. Sadly, these are not considered a criterion for promotions. Additionally, academic leaders lack awareness of ranked journals and quality parameters and indexes. My conversations with colleagues at various higher education institutions (HEIs) reveal another significant barrier to research productivity: Promotion to administrative roles. Several dedicated researchers find that once they are promoted to dean or associate dean positions, they no longer have the time to conduct research. This problem is compounded by the fact that most HEIs do not allow faculty members the flexibility to focus exclusively on research, forcing them to juggle administrative duties alongside their academic work. Nepali academicians also face significant challenges in accessing up-to-date software for data analysis and quality journals, as most universities in the country do not subscribe to the high-quality academic resources available at many international institutions. This lack of access restricts their ability to publish in reputable outlets. Furthermore, even if a researcher manages to get published in a prestigious journal, universities in Nepal are often unable to cover the article processing charges (APCs), which many institutions abroad pay for. Additionally, unlike reputed Indian HEIs, where faculty are incentivised to produce high-quality research articles and case studies, such a system does not exist in Nepal. As a result, faculty members have little motivation to prioritise research, leading them to focus predominantly on teaching responsibilities. The University Grants Commission (UGC), established under the University Grants Commission Act of 1993, allocates a large portion of its budget—about 50.4 percent—to Tribhuvan University, leaving little for other institutions. The UGC's Research Development and Innovation Programs Implementation Guidelines (2019) aim to support junior faculty members and PhD students, but the process is often challenging. My experience with the UGC when applying for a PhD scholarship was frustrating. Despite meeting the eligibility criteria, my application was rejected without clear reasoning, leaving me disillusioned.Cultivating a research cultureUniversities in Nepal should serve as knowledge centres that actively produce new knowledge. Academicians must seek research funding from domestic and international sources at both the individual and institutional levels. The UGC should develop mechanisms to allocate research funds based on the quality of research output, with clear indicators such as publication in reputable journals and citation counts. Those who contribute significantly to high-quality research should be incentivised, ensuring their work gains recognition within Nepal and the global academic community. Without such incentives, research in Nepal will remain underappreciated and disconnected from the broader international research landscape. In conclusion, cultivating a genuine research culture in Nepal requires concerted efforts from all stakeholders. Leaders in academia, governments and businesses must all recognise the importance of research for scholarly and broader national growth. With sufficient financing, institutional support and dedication to scientific rigour, Nepal can foster an atmosphere where research flourishes and advances knowledge worldwide. \nAlthough pregnancy is a hopeful period in a woman’s life, it is regrettably a tragic experience for many Nepali women. Across the country, Nepali mothers continue to risk their lives while giving birth. While Article 38 of the Constitution of Nepal asserts that every woman shall have the right to safe motherhood and reproductive health, Nepali women are nowhere close to fully exercising their reproductive rights. This failure to ensure safe motherhood is yet another reminder of the country’s perpetual neglect in protecting the rights and lives of its women.In Nepal, safe motherhood was identified as a national priority with the launch of the National Safe Motherhood Programme in 1998. Later, the country even received the Millenium Development Goals award for bringing down its maternal mortality rate (MMR) from 539 per 100,000 live births in 1996 to 239 in 2016. However, progress in maternal deaths has since stalled. In the fiscal year 2023-2024, at least 190 women from 51 districts died of complications during childbirth, as per the data from the Family Welfare Division under the Department of Health Service. In the previous fiscal year, 191 maternal deaths were recorded across 49 districts. Although the country has committed to reducing the MMR to 70 per 100,000 births by 2030 in order to meet the Sustainable Development Goals target, given the current trends, this appears ambitious. Nepal has already missed its target of reducing MMR to 125 per 100,000 live births by 2020. According to experts, postpartum haemorrhage and pre-eclampsia (pregnancy-related high blood pressure disorders) are the chief causes of maternal deaths in Nepal. To identify the number and causes of fatalities, maternal and perinatal death surveillance programmes are imperative. However, instead of full scale implementation of such a fundamental programme, these are being conducted in only 51 districts due to inadequate budget. Such miscalculation can create considerable knowledge gaps related to maternal mortality and care, the knowledge that is vital for introducing targeted interventions. Since the adoption of federalism, the country’s health system management has been delegated to provincial and local governments. Local governments can now implement health offices and facilities. However, this hasn’t produced satisfactory results as many health posts and primary health centres are just buildings, with a severe lack of medical supplies and skilled health workers. Although the government has prioritised maternal health-related programmes and policies, which are on paper progressive, they need to be locally relevant and require routine monitoring and revisits. For instance, lack of competent, Skilled Birth Attendants (SBA) is still a major issue, even though the country formulated the SBA policy in 2005. The long-term strategy to educate and deploy better trained midwives is yet to materialise, leading to the ongoing training of Auxiliary Nurse Midwives, basic nursing cadres, as SBAs.This state of affairs is untenable. Infrastructure accessibility and quality healthcare availability should go together during policy implementation. Many people in remote areas still seek faith healers during childbirth and only consider medical services in emergencies. So introducing facilities without communicating their importance to the people is not enough. Additionally, the government must prioritise marginalised communities while ensuring birth preparedness, financial incentives, free delivery services, abortion care and community-based partum care programmes. Further empowerment of local governments and improved coordination between the federal and provincial levels would also help. The failure to ensure good health for our young mothers puts the future of upcoming generations and, by extension, the country’s future, in jeopardy.  \nNepalis with disabilities face the daily ordeal of navigating cities that are not built for them. Whenever roads and sidewalks are built or expanded, the disabled community harbours hope of easier mobility. However, the authorities either overlook the accessibility for such people or carelessly build structures that are supposed to assist them. This renders people not only disabled by their conditions but also by infrastructural shortcomings. According to the National Census 2021, 2.2 percent of Nepal’s population has some form of disability; 2.5 percent of males and 2 percent of females have a disability. The country ratified the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities in December 2009. Moreover, the provisions in the Disability Rights Act ensure accessibility to physical infrastructure. Although Nepal has a progressive policy on the rights of people with disabilities, the implementation part has been lagging. An audit published by the National Federation of the Disabled-Nepal on 150 public infrastructure sites in Kathmandu showed that no samples were completely accessible: 132 samples were found “not accessible”, while the rest were “partially accessible”. In 2021, the Department of Roads allocated Rs 50 million for disabled-friendly pavements and even completed the first phase, a 1.5km stretch from Putalisadak to Thapathali. Although this is commendable, these supposedly disabled-friendly pavements need routine monitoring, as most of the tactile pavings built earlier ended abruptly or led to electricity poles, trees, walls or drains. Generalising disabilities and offering solutions that only cater to a specific group is also problematic. Most of the time, the authorities build tactile paving and label the area disability-friendly. However, problems of people with other forms of physical and intellectual disability—such as lack of tactile or audio indicators at zebra crossings, narrow sidewalks and absence of ramps—remain unaddressed.Although road accidents occasionally make headlines, accidents involving people with disabilities rarely get noticed. Many unreported cases involve people with disabilities falling into rivers or drains, collisions with poles or trees due to ineffective tactile blocks, and hit-and-run cases while crossing roads. These accidents can be avoided if basic assistance like railings, ramps, audio and tactile indicators, etc are ensured. In many instances, these problems arise not from the lack of disability-friendly infrastructures but from the general mismanagement and poor condition of public infrastructures. Potholes are a common sight on older roads and even some newer ones in Kathmandu. With the city’s rapid urbanisation, construction is happening every few metres. Building materials are often placed on sidewalks that are already narrow, leaving pedestrians with no choice but to walk on the roads. This poses a risk for everyone and could be perilous for people with disabilities. Moreover, the roads that seem perfectly fine the previous day are under maintenance the next day. The authorities do not consider providing an alternative disability-friendly route. Even the signs that inform of the situation of the roads ahead are ineffective. Doing the bare minimum to check the inclusivity list is not an option. Many government office buildings in Nepal are not disability-friendly, and the same applies to institutions like schools and universities. This is also due to the lack of proper budget, as disabled-friendly infrastructures are often not prioritised, depriving a significant and capable portion of the population of their fundamental rights. The government must ensure that people with disabilities have the rights that are promised in the constitution. As for our part as citizens, we must abandon our primitive mindset and be more inclusive of people with disabilities in our thoughts and actions. It’s time we realise that an inclusive nation leaves no one behind as it progresses.  \nNearly two weeks after the rain-induced disasters and even as the festive season is already underway, victims in the hardest-hit areas still await rescue and relief. On Friday, the government declared several disaster-affected local units in 14 districts “disaster crisis zones” to accelerate rehabilitation, recovery and reconstruction efforts. Although this was much needed, it also leaves us wondering whether this is yet another perfunctory step. This is evident from last year’s figures, as among the 865 families displaced from landslides, only 300 have had second instalment relief to rebuild houses; the rest haven’t even started reconstruction works. Many people in disaster-ravaged areas are living in isolation, without electricity and drinking water. Kavrepalanchowk, a hill district of Bagmati Province, has been one of the worst-affected areas by landslides and floods from the September 27 and 28 rains, which have claimed 78 lives in the district so far. Accessibility is a big hurdle for relief and rehabilitation due to the geographical remoteness of the areas and the disruption of the roads caused by floods and landslides. However, some organisations have figured out ways to address this challenge effectively.A recent Post report from Kavrepalanchowk about how a non-profit organisation called Hami Nepal used a drone to transport relief materials to Magargaun from Kalanti in ward 12 of Panauti Municipality has kindled hope among such affected communities. The drone, which can transport goods up to 4 to 5 kilometres, took 600kg of relief materials to disaster-hit areas in the district on Sunday. When rescue and relief workers from the central level cannot access areas post-disaster, local units must be the first responders. However, agencies under local units lack expertise and funds and are ill-prepared to tackle emerging problems. Additionally, the government lacks institutions that solely focus on enhancing the nation’s ability to manage disasters. The Department of Water-Induced Disaster Management, previously known as the Disaster Prevention Technical Centre, has been merged with other departments whose primary functions differ considerably from strengthening local capacity to handle floods and landslides. Indeed, the government failed miserably to mitigate the impacts of a predictable disaster; it must now prioritise swift and effective post-disaster response. Although the severity of the disaster this time was unprecedented, monsoons in Nepal bring havoc every year. However, only when the disaster strikes do the authorities spring into action. Such a reactive response puts the lives of many people at risk, every single year. Many donor agencies and non-governmental and non-profit organisations have been relentlessly working to save lives since the disaster hit the communities and are better equipped and trained. Perhaps the government can both learn and partner with them to facilitate the exchange of knowledge, skills, expertise, resources, and grassroots experiences during such a crisis. A bottom-up approach is warranted, with the local units better equipped with training, funding and awareness. Moreover, collaboration between local and national units must be strengthened for effective disaster response and communication.As the declaration of disaster “crisis zone” remains in effect for three months and authorities plan to restore roads and private buildings while providing rehabilitation and relief in this time frame, they must expedite their actions and ensure that victims do not face a challenging winter ahead.  \nCentral and eastern parts of Nepal witnessed devastating incidents of landslides and floods last week. At least 244 people were killed, while 19 are still missing. The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal sat down with Basanta Raj Adhikari, director at the Centre for Disaster Studies, Institute of Engineering at Tribhuvan University, to discuss how the country can be better prepared to manage the disasters and minimise damages.Recently we faced disastrous floods and landslides. How do you analyse the losses? Could the damages have been reduced with better preparation and timely response?To begin with, I want to make one thing clear. There is a fundamental difference between a disaster and hazard. Hazard is always natural but it becomes a disaster if there is human involvement. If there is a landslide in a jungle with no human activity, it is a hazard. If a landslide hit a human settlement and it required external involvement to restore the place, then it becomes a disaster. An earthquake is a hazard but it becomes a disaster when man-made structures kill people. As far as the losses from the recent floods are concerned, we could have minimised them with better preparation. For instance, Nakkhu was one of the worst hit areas in the Kathmandu Valley. The river there has drastically narrowed and a human settlement has been developed on the riverbanks in recent years. Human activities in rivers are natural as human civilisations took place on the banks of rivers. But it should be done without disrupting the natural flow of the water. We developed huge settlements encroaching the riverbanks. This invited huge losses. Such activities could have been avoided.As Nepal witnessed record-high rainfalls, were not these losses to be expected? It is true that the country witnessed record rainfalls this season, the highest in the past over five decades. Climate change has caused extreme weather events in recent years. But we can’t blame only natural factors. If you see the images of 2003, it clearly shows that the place where the MediCity Hospital now stands is clearly the floodplain of the Nakkhu river. If you go further downstream, you see a colony. This is how we have encroached riverbanks. We can encroach rivers but it should be done in a scientific way. What is scientific encroachment of rivers?We can model flooding based on the highest volume of water a river can carry. Based on such evidence, we can decide what kind of activities can and cannot be carried out on a riverbank. We can develop settlements but that should be based on scientific evidence and data. Another important concept we should follow is risk sensitive land use planning. Nepal government has already prepared land use maps of all the 753 local units that give vital information about a particular place such as the soil, land capability, risk layer, present land use map, zoning map and cadastral layer. But some people have stopped the authorities from implementing the maps as once they are passed, a land categorised as an agricultural area cannot be converted into commercial land. If that scheme is implemented, one can’t build a house in high flood land. Now the local authorities enforce only the building codes and that don’t include these provisions. That doesn’t inquire whether a building is being built on a riverbank or a landslide susceptible area. In developed countries, those who build in high flood risk areas have to pay more in insurance. Also, areas are categorised based on the chances of occurrence of landslides on the basis of soil type, rock type, geology, distance from a drainage or a road etcetera and structures built there are dealt with accordingly. We are witnessing extreme weather events. In this context, what should we do to prevent more loss in the days ahead?We require an engineering paradigm shift in building infrastructures. The extreme weather patterns have made the data we used to refer to in the past while building infrastructures irrelevant. The data on water levels that were referred to while making a bridge in a river now need to be updated as water levels in our rivers have been rising in recent years. The existing infrastructures can’t withstand that volume of water. We witnessed record rainfalls last week. This can be a reference data for some years. Also, the sedimentation pattern has changed because of human settlements built upstream.Second, we have a generalised rule of building roads across the country. The impact of 200 millilitres of rainfall in Pokhara and rainfall of the same volume in Jhapa is different. As Pokhara experiences rains on a regular basis, the soil in the area can withstand it because it has been weathered by regular rain but the same volume of rainfall can cause more losses in Jhapa because of weak soil there. We thus have to consider the strength of soil while building a structure in a particular place.There is a single road construction method across the country, whether the place is in a high himalayan range, Mahabharat, Shivalik hills or plains. We have to make specific rules for specific places based on the geological and soil structures. The parameters of road construction should be redefined. We are improving the weather forecasting system but now we also need impact-based forecasting to inform the public not only about the volume of likely rainfall but also its likely impact.Where are the problems in our disaster response approach?The Natural Calamity (Relief) Act, 1982 was guided by a fatalistic approach as it saw natural hazards as destined by fate. Then came Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Act, 2017. This change in law is in fact a paradigm shift in disaster management in Nepal. The new law’s perspective is progressive. The new Act changed us from response-centric to preparedness-centric. Legally, we are on a progressive path. But we lag in implementation. We also need to upgrade our skills in handling the situation. Our constitution as well as laws have entrusted local units with the responsibility of handling disaster incidents on their own. The government should make people at the local level aware, and equip and train them for the purpose.Training on some important procedures such as the INSARAG preparedness and response guidelines can be quite effective. Such training and other activities aimed at helping local units to handle disaster incidents should be conducted at the ward levels. “Understanding risk” is an important aspect in disaster management. So common people should be sensitised to the consequences of disaster incidents. You can see people collecting timber from flooded rivers, taking selfies on riverbanks and gathering on a bridge above a roaring river. People at all local wards need to be well-equipped. Those who were swept away at Nakkhu could have been saved if the security personnel and other people there had at least motorboats and life jackets. Our rescue workers now lack even such basic things.Settlements in Nepal’s mountainous and hill areas are located in equally risky zones. What should be done to safeguard them?The mountains in our region are taken as young and the Himalayan range is in the building process. It is also called an active mountain belt. Therefore, we experience frequent earthquakes. Earthquakes cause geomorphological changes. A large number of settlements in Nepal’s hills sit on the debris of old landslides that might have occurred long back. People there should be made aware of the risk and these places be identified. Engineering measures should be taken to make them safe. Scattered populations mainly in the highlands need to be integrated in concentrated settlements.What is the latest status of glaciers and glacial lakes in our mountains?The pace of glacial melting is rising alarmingly because of rising temperature. Earlier, we took only big glacial lakes as threats and gave them more attention but recent incidents showed that even smaller ones pose a threat. The incident of the Thame glacial lake outburst in August showed how the outburst of even a small glacial lake could have a cascading effect. Likewise, the deposits of landslides being piled above 3,000 metres are another serious challenge. Such sediment deposition is increasing in the mountains while there is a huge population downstream. The frequency of cascading hazards has increased, emerging as a major challenge. A landslide blocks a river and when the river breaches the structure built of debris, it causes devastating losses downstream.How can we scientifically prove that the hazards we are seeing were the result of climate change?There has to be scientific evidence to make the link. For instance, the Thame glacial outburst was clearly a climate change-induced hazard as it did not involve human activities. The treeline and snowline are shifting upwards in our mountains. There were no mosquitoes in Mustang until some years ago. Now mosquitos are widespread in the district as temperature there has significantly increased. The crop pattern has changed drastically. Thus we have a number of scientific evidence to show clear signs of climate change in this part of the world. What the government should now do is properly document these climate change-induced incidents following internationally-accepted methods and present them at relevant UN bodies. \nNepal’s economy that has been facing one after another setbacks since the 2015 earthquake has been struggling to bounce back. Last week, two international agencies—the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the Asian Development Bank (ADB)—announced that Nepal’s economy was poised to improve in the upcoming fiscal year. In this context, the Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal sat down with Nara Bahadur Thapa, former executive director of the research department of Nepal Rastra Bank, to discuss the current state of the national economy. The ADB, in its report last week, anticipated Nepal’s economy to grow by 4.9 percent this fiscal. A few days earlier, a visiting IMF team also painted an improving picture of Nepal’s economy. How do you see these projections?Nepal’s economic growth in the past 2-3 years has remained below 5 percent. But successive governments in their fiscal budgets have been setting the target of 6 to 7 percent growth. Also, the budget this year has aimed for 6 percent growth. In the meantime, two donor agencies have painted an improving picture of our economy. The ADB has anticipated 4.9 percent growth. Also, the IMF’s team that visited Nepal on a fact finding mission has projected better prospects. They expected better yield from the agriculture sector as Nepal is witnessing more rains. Last year, the growth of agriculture was 3 percent. Now they expect the sector may grow by 3.5 to 4 percent and that may lift overall growth. They have cited improvement in tourism and increased energy export as other bases. Based on these grounds, the ADB has projected 4.9 percent economic growth. But even the target of 5 percent growth looks ambitious if you analyse economic data available as of now and the steps taken by government agencies. We have witnessed more rain but that doesn’t always do us good. More rain in the late monsoon often damages paddy at the time of harvest. Second, the heavy monsoon has caused huge losses in our infrastructure such as roads and bridges that are vital to keep the daily lives and trade running. This may impact potential economic growth as some vital highways and roads have been badly damaged. These factors may pose a challenge in achieving the targets set by the government and donor agencies. Another important factor is that the ratio of capital formation to GDP [gross domestic product] is consistently decreasing. It was 33.8 in the fiscal year 2018-19, it decreased to 30.5 in 2019-20, to 29.3 in 2020-21, 29.0 in 2021-22, 25.1 in 2022-23 and 24.5 in 2023-24. How can we expect economic growth when capital formation keeps decreasing. We can’t achieve 6 percent growth without first improving the situation of capital formation. Capital formation in the private sector is on a decline and the government hasn’t been able to boost it. On the other hand, capital expenditure was lower in the past fiscal year in comparison to the previous fiscal. There is no strong sign of increasing capital formation even in the coming year. This is because the government has failed to collect revenue as per its own target. The revenue collection ratio is falling. It has come down to 18 percent of GDP, from 22 percent not so long ago. With this, the government’s funding capacity is continuously declining. It has failed even to fulfil its own duties. For instance, it hasn’t been able to pay health insurance bills and or the contractors. Similarly, credit offtake from private banks to the private sector has not increased from 6 percent. It used to be around 15-16 percent. Also, no substantive initiatives have been taken to improve productivity. For this, government agencies have to cut red tape. The private sector isn’t optimistic. We are talking a lot but not working seriously to lay a strong ground for growth.What are the signs that private investors are pessimistic?There is enough liquidity in the banks, and the interest rate is decreasing, but the private sector is not borrowing. Bankers say there is no demand from the sector. This indicates pessimism. None of the big business houses have launched any big projects in recent times. The government talks a lot about the energy sector but it is not doing power purchase agreements (PPAs) with hydropower project developers. We aren’t doing enough to realise the goal of exporting 10,000MW electricity to India. This shows no serious effort is being made to initiate reforms. The capital market has required some urgent reforms. But the government hasn’t appointed office bearers in the regulatory body for the past seven months. The government hasn’t given permission to issue IPOs and FPOs. Hence, the government is keeping two important sectors—energy and capital market—on hold. All these trends and activities suggest it will be a challenge to achieve even moderate economic growth.You pointed to the policy hurdles but the multilateral agencies have hailed the government for policy reforms. The IMF in its statement has welcomed recent amendments to various laws and the ADB has welcomed “the cautiously accommodative monetary policy”. Don’t these statements reflect reality?While making their positions public, the international agencies follow certain norms and criteria. First, they take macro pictures such as the government’s commitments. They take the pledges made by the government in the investment summit seriously. They think the commitments will be implemented. Second, they don’t want to irk the host country by presenting a bleak picture because they are diplomats. They point out possible pitfalls during bilateral and table talks but present themselves diplomatically while making their official statements public.Remittance, tourism and energy export are taken as major bases for economic growth but all three depend on external factors. How reliable can the projection be?Without trading and increasing exports, we can’t progress economically. We need to export to increase production and create jobs. Export is an engine of economic growth. Anyhow, we must increase exports. About your query, the government should tackle such things by strengthening relations with the countries concerned and devise policies and strategies accordingly.Our economy is increasingly dependent on remittance. How risky is it in the long run?Remittance has become a boon for our economy. It has played a tremendous role in poverty reduction. The first Nepal Living Standard Survey (NLSS) conducted by the Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS)—now the National Statistics Office—in 1995-96 showed 42 percent Nepali population living below the poverty line. The latest [fourth] living standard survey has shown the poverty level at 20 percent. It wouldn’t be possible without remittance. Therefore, we can’t undermine the role of remittance in this social transformation. Were not the government’s plans and policies responsible for this achievement?The government role would not have been enough. What government policies have created jobs in Nepal? Are there any schemes worth mentioning? The industrialisation hasn’t increased. It is the industrial sector that creates jobs but the share of the manufacturing sector has come down to 4.87 percent in total GDP. Some years ago, it was nearly 9-10 percent. It shows our economy is being deindustrialised. How can we reduce poverty without providing jobs to the youths? Thus, foreign employment played a vital role in poverty reduction. Second is the role of remittance in maintaining foreign exchange reserves, which is essential to buy things from abroad. We have sufficient foreign exchange reserves because of remittance.Information Technology is now projected as a promising sector in creating jobs and transforming Nepal’s economy. How realistic is this expectation?Four fields can be taken as promising sectors in Nepal—agriculture, tourism, IT and hydropower. The IT sector certainly has a bright future. As our country is land-locked, we have additional challenges in merchandise exports and we can’t be competitive. The IT sector won’t have that barrier so it can be competitive in the international market. But for that the government has to formulate IT-friendly policies. For instance, if a Kathmandu-based Nepali firm wants to sell services in the US, Europe or any other international market, they need liaison offices in those countries. Otherwise, they can’t be competitive and grow. But the government doesn’t provide foreign exchange for them to expand their business abroad.Without this policy reform, Nepalis can’t compete with IT companies from other countries. Similarly, foreign companies need to come and work here so that Nepali youths can learn from them. Foreign banks came to Nepal and Nepali bankers learned. Now Nepali banks are doing good. But our policies aren’t favourable for foreigners interested in setting up IT firms. Also, well-trained IT workers are in shortage. We are progressing but we have to put in extra effort to make transformative changes in this sector.The cooperatives’ scam has emerged as a serious issue. What impact may it cause in the national economy if it’s not resolved soon?The cooperative sector played a vital role in creating financial inclusion in our economy by making 7.3 million people its members. Those who couldn’t do their regular transactions with banks were engaged with cooperatives. If that sector collapses, our state of financial inclusion will decline too. Second, they were major financiers for micro, small and medium enterprises (MSME). Cooperatives are directly linked to entrepreneurship through MSMEs. They played a role in making interest rates of banks more competitive as well as banks and financial institutions were under pressure by the interest rates offered by cooperatives. Now they won’t feel the pressure.In this context, many people may resort to informal transactions. According to the 16th periodic plan, nearly 50 percent of Nepal’s economy is informal. We are under pressure to reduce the portion of the informal economy. But the crisis in the cooperative sector may increase the informal economy as those who were involved in cooperatives, which is a formal sector, are likely to do informal transactions with traders or other individuals.Cooperatives are not well regulated and there are anomalies but they are registered in a government agency, pay taxes, have offices and a record system. They brought people in far-flung villages under a formal channel. If the depositors resort to individual transactions, their money will be unsafe. The constitution accepted them as one of the three pillars—along with the government and the private sector—of the country’s economy. The sector expanded its network where there were no economic activities from the government and private sectors. For instance, the government was providing certain services such as distributing fertilisers, crop seeds, sugar through cooperatives. People will now be deprived of these services. Also, the commercial banks might face complications due to the domino effect of the cooperative scam. For instance, if the government seizes the land put up by a cooperative as a collateral in a bank and sells it to return the deposits, the bank might be in trouble.It is also said that cooperatives were becoming platforms for money laundering. How serious was the problem?Cooperatives didn’t seek a source of money from the depositors while accepting big deposits. They weren’t affiliated to the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) of the central bank and the Anti-Money Laundering/Countering the Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT). Therefore, there is a problem of money laundering. It can be resolved when they get affiliated with the FIU.What initiatives should be taken to address the problems seen in the cooperative sector?A powerful regulatory authority should be established without delay. The authority should work as a dedicated agency to clear the mess. Then, AML/CFT provisions should be implemented, a credit information centre should be set up and a debt recovery tribunal formed, and deposits guaranteed. The concept of self-regulation isn’t enough. These financial infrastructures are essential. \nThe parliamentary special probe committee formed to investigate cooperatives scam submitted its report last week. The government has already started implementing the report. In this context, Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal sat down with the committee chair Surya Thapa for more insights on the probe’s findings and the anomalies in the cooperative sector they saw during the investigation.After your committee submitted the report on cooperatives scam, people have interpreted its findings in different ways. Why the confusion?Our committee prepared, finalised and endorsed the report unanimously. No member registered any dissent. This is an important point. However, people have interpreted its findings a bit differently. The supporters of [Rastriya Swatantra Party chair] Rabi Lamichhane have tried to make it appear like the report has given him a clean chit. They have selectively taken a certain portion of the report which states that Lamichhane’s involvement couldn’t be formally established in the process of transferring funds from cooperatives to the Gorkha Media Network. But a huge amount of money has been provided to the Gorkha Media Network from various cooperatives against the Cooperative Act 2017, which prohibits investment of cooperative deposits to any company. It is seen that Lamichhane is directly involved in spending the funds collected from the cooperatives. Based on that, we have found chair of the media company Gitendra Babu (GB) Rai, the then managing director Rabi Lamichhane, directors Chhabilal Joshi and Kumar Ramtel directly responsible in the misuse of cooperative funds and have asked the government to take action against them as per the existing laws. The aforementioned two aspects are inextricably linked. We didn’t find any evidence of transfer of cooperative funds to Lamichhane’s personal bank account. It is sent to the bank account of the Gorkha Media Network. The KYC form of the Global IME Bank shows that Lamichhane is one of the three holders of the joint account. Any one of the three can issue cheques from the account. The funds invested as loan in the Gorkha Media Network have been transferred to the joint bank account, from where Lamichhane has released money by signing cheques. This is how Lamichhane is directly involved in embezzlement of the cooperative funds. Many argue that as per the cooperative law only those who release money from the cooperatives are held responsible but not those who spend it after it is received at the company. Is that the case?The Cooperative Act 2017 prohibits releasing any loan to a company. But it is sent to the company, where Lamichhane is an owner with 15 percent share and a managing director. And, the money is misused there. An informal statement of GB Rai shows Rs1.20 billion of cooperative deposits has been invested in the media company while our financial analysis shows the amount is Rs654 million. Evidence shows Rs220 million has been directly sent to the media company’s bank account. Depositors have been deprived of their money. Other staff working at the company aren’t responsible but the owners are. They could be charged with cooperative fraud under the Cooperative Act, fraud and duping under the National Penal Code, organised crime cases under the Organised Crime Prevention Act, and money laundering cases under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act. Some individuals involved with various cooperatives including Roshni Gurung of a Butwal-based cooperative told the committee that they deposited millions of rupees in the bank account of a person named Rabi Lamichhane. Kumar Ramtel said the person named Rabi Lamichhane is none other than the Rastriya Swatantra Party chair. Still, the committee couldn’t establish the link. What is the complication?The flow of the money shows the connection but documents to link the transactions are not available. We didn’t find documents with Lamichhane’s signatures and fingerprints that needed to be submitted to get a loan. All the seven cooperatives run by GB Rai were releasing loans without following due procedure. But we have successfully traced the flow of the money. The loan amount created in the name of Rabi Lamichhane in Butwal and deposited by Roshni Gurung had reached the Gorkha Media Network’s bank account which was jointly operated by GB Rai, Rabi Lamichhane and Chhabilal Joshi. This is an established fact. The committee didn’t find any document showing the flow of cooperative money to his personal account. But that alone is insufficient to give him a clean chit as a huge sum has been sent to the media company’s bank account jointly run by three people including Lamichhane. Another sum from the Supreme Cooperative has been deposited to the bank account of Gorkha Media Network. The bank voucher shows Roshni Gurung/Rabi Lamichhane as depositors. The amount also goes to the same joint account.Now the government has forwarded the report to the investigation agencies. Do you think the agencies can unearth the missing documents?Our committee worked in a different way to regular House committees. We followed methods of investigation just like the police investigation agencies and government’s prosecution agencies do. We recorded the suspects’ statements, took their fingerprints, and got the signatures to authenticate their statements. I believe this is a new practice by a Nepali parliamentary committee. Sufficient evidence has already been gathered in the past as well. While carrying out this task and preparing the 1,124-page document, we have followed the norms and procedures of an investigation body.During the interrogation, many suspects told the committee that they knew nothing and shifted the responsibility to GB Rai, who is on the run. Those from seven cooperatives–Hamro Nayakrishi Multipurpose Cooperatives; Swarnalaxmi; Supreme; Suryadarshan; Sahara; Samanata and Sano Paila and the officials from Gorkha Media Network gave such answers. Their common answer is, “I don’t know about this, GB Rai does.” Many of them might have been trying to evade their responsibility by blaming Rai. The government has failed to produce Rai. Won’t this investigation be incomplete in his absence?Based on its facts and evidence, the investigation report is complete. Yes, 29 suspects including GB Rai are at large. They are believed to be staying abroad. Their statements have not been recorded. But that doesn’t make the investigation incomplete. We have accessed the database of Gorkha Media Network and other cooperative organisations, collected important documents and analysed them. There is no confusion about the money embezzled in the scam. We have determined a total of Rs2.58 billion from various cooperatives has been misused by investing in several organisations including the Gorkha Media Network, Nature Nest, Nature Herbs, Gorkha Group of Investment, Gorkha Ayurved Company—49 people were responsible for these investments, including GB Rai. Of that, Rs654 million has been invested in Gorkha Media Network. A total of Rs8 billion has been embezzled in the seven cooperatives where Rai is involved. So the investigation is complete. During the interrogation, some office bearers of cooperatives claimed they had no role in the transactions as they were dummy officials and GB Rai and some individuals Rai trusted did everything. How convincing is that?The practice of creating dummy officials, fake documents, false marriages and divorces etcetera is rampant in the cooperative sector. In the seven cooperatives GB Rai is at the centre. He has at least one key person in each of these seven cooperatives as chair or manager and carries out everything through them. In some of them, the chairpersons know nothing. The cooperatives don’t follow any norms, rules and regulations of cooperatives. They work just on the basis of orders they get from Rai or his trusted individuals over the phone. Rai gets advice from a California-based individual named Gyan Bahadur Bamjan. The Cooperative Act prohibits an individual from being a member of more than one cooperative but Rai is involved in at least seven cooperatives as a chair, secretary, vice-chair or patron.The government has decided to implement the report. How should the state agencies work to bring good results?The government should immediately initiate action against four persons—Rabi Lamichhane, GB Rai, Chhabilal Joshi and Kumar Ramtel—as the report has found them responsible for misusing cooperative funds. We have also determined the roles and responsibilities of around 1,000 individuals who were chair, vice-chairs, secretaries, treasurers, account chiefs or others who in decision making roles in 40 cooperatives we were tasked to investigate. They should be brought under investigation and their properties should be seized so as to create an environment to return the depositors’ money.Different arrangements need to be made about those who are in judicial custody. They should be released, their all documents including passports seized and they should be kept under surveillance and allowed to take initiatives to return the depositors’ money. The government, while unveiling the fiscal budget, had announced to take initiatives to return deposits upto Rs500,000 by keeping cooperatives’ assets as collateral. This process should be expedited. Likewise, the government should set up an all-powerful regulatory authority. At present, all the 753 local governments, seven provincial governments and the federal government have the regulatory role. That is pointless. Now a strong dedicated regulatory authority should be formed. The Crisis-ridden Cooperatives Management Committee is there but it should be made more effective by giving it greater executive powers. When a cooperative is in crisis, the regulatory body should take over its management and fix the crisis just like Nepal Rastra Bank does in the banking sector.What patterns of anomalies did you find in the cooperatives?The fundamental idea of a cooperative is to run by its own members based on self-regulation. But a few board members were found to be using all the authority and misusing the funds while members were unaware about the affairs in the organisations. The board members use most of the resources for their relatives and other closed ones. Annual meetings are organised as picnics and wedding parties. In some cases, annual meetings are fake, audit reports, auditors and signatures, all are fake.In the course of preparing the committee report, I have coined terms like ‘cooperative divorce’ and ‘cooperative marriage’. Divorce and marriage documents are prepared based on the fortune of the cooperatives. There was misappropriation of Rs120 million in a cooperative, where Jyoti Gurung was manager, in 2075 BS. Dhan Raj Gurung, who is Nepali Congress Vice-president, divorced his wife Jyoti in 2076 BS. But, in 2077, Dhan Raj presented himself as a guarantor of a loan to Jyoti. Again in 2080, both of them jointly paid back a loan of Rs9.1 million. This is a bit of a trend in the cooperative sector.Do you think we need to reconsider the basic idea of cooperatives as self-regulated organisations?In the report, we haven’t questioned its principle, need and importance. Cooperative sector is vital for our economy. But the concept of self-regulation as stated in the Cooperative Act 2017 has failed. Now, this sector should be overseen by a strong regulatory body. Still, the idea of self-regulation can be given continuity as the members should be allowed to run the cooperatives on their own but their activities should be strictly regulated by a powerful authority. Moreover, the cooperatives that do big transactions should be regulated by the central bank.Why did the present regulatory bodies fail?There were over 50 lawmakers who proudly identified themselves as office bearers of certain cooperatives. They over-emphasised self-regulation and undermined the role of regulatory bodies. Individuals like GB Rai and other fraudsters benefited from that. Therefore, we recommended stringent laws and a stronger regulatory authority. \nNepal is marking its ninth Constitution Day on Thursday. The country’s two largest parties—the Nepali Congress and the CPN-UML—formed a coalition government a month ago with a commitment to reviewing and amending the constitution. In this context, Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal and Binod Ghimire sat down with constitutional expert Purna Man Shakya to discuss the good and bad aspects of the constitution amendment process.The Congress and the UML have floated a proposal to amend the constitution. Is the time ripe to make changes in our statute?Generally, constitutions are reviewed after around a decade of their implementation. So, we have come to the stage of reviewing whether our constitution has functioned properly. However, the sudden announcement of the amendment is premature, as this is a serious business. In our case, the constitution can’t be amended just based on the interest of one or two parties. It requires a national consensus. There should be an understanding among the political parties represented in Parliament. And, a sort of consensus even among the people’s level is important as there was huge public involvement in making this constitution. Sentiment of various communities must be respected while making any changes in the national charter. What can be the modality of seeking consensus at the people’s level? Should a draft be prepared and opened up for debate?While making changes in the constitution, some issues might be technical and not of interest to common people. But if any changes are made in policy issues that can alter our country’s structural dynamics, the concerned communities must be consulted. Just the present strength of the political parties represented in Parliament is no guarantee that they truly represent people. For instance, the Maoists emerged as the largest party through the election in 2008. But it has been shrunk to a distant third in the House. However, we can’t conclude from this that the people have discarded the party’s agenda. The Maoists might have been discredited due to their activities and failure in delivery but people might still favour the agenda they once championed. Similar is the case with other parties. Therefore, we have to consider broader consensus both in Parliament as well as the people’s level.How challenging is it to enter the constitution amendment process?Any amendment calls for a two-thirds majority in the House of Representatives as well as the National Assembly in the federal parliament. If an issue is linked to provincial authority, it should be endorsed by the majority [four] of seven provinces. So, this is not easy. Therefore, the parties should tread carefully.You mentioned earlier that constitution amendments without a review process is not a right step. Could you elaborate?The right way is to first have broad understanding among the top leaders of political forces on the issues and then constitute a panel of experts to conduct a comprehensive study on that. Such studies are conducted through two methods—doctrinal and non-doctrinal. The doctrinal method analyses related literature and principles on theoretical approach while the non-doctrinal method studies the public sentiments and opinions through surveys and interactions, and comes up with certain methodologies with the help of subject experts. Through such study, the experts identify the issues and recommend the ways to the politicians. This is the right process.There are also arguments that reviewing the constitution without even bringing it into full-fledged implementation is wrong. Based on the practice during these years, we have concluded that certain provisions didn’t work properly. It is true that we are talking about making changes in the constitution without even implementing certain provisions. First we have to give the system an opportunity to work in a full-fledged way. Then, we can evaluate whether it worked. Any move to dissolve the system without properly implementing it will create divisions and invite another conflict. A question that is often asked: Is there a problem with our constitution or with our politicians? People can change the constitution but the constitution can’t change the people. Therefore, a constitution should be developed also on the basis of the nature of people in the country who use it. If our political parties and the politicians had reformed themselves, we might not have had to discuss constitutional changes time and again. We should have made the system strong for more effective checks and balances and made leaders and officials more accountable. The ruling parties reason that the constitution amendment became necessary to ensure political stability.When a federal government is changed, its aftershocks are immediately seen in all seven provincial governments. It directly impacts development and other activities across the country. It’s a flaw in our party system but we have to find a solution in the system. We see people raising voices for two things—stability and retirement of old politicians. As Nepali politicians never retire voluntarily, we have to address it through the system. Direct election of executive head can be one way to address this problem. People have found local governments more effective than federal and provincial governments. It is because chiefs and representatives of local governments are directly elected and they can serve the full five-year term.Once people are given the right to elect heads of government, they won’t elect old faces such as KP Oli, Sher Bahadur Deuba and Prachanda [Pushpa Kamal Dahal], who have been tested multiple times. It will serve two purposes—first, it gives stability and second, it allows popular leaders to emerge in place of the old ones. The old leaders have maintained control over national politics through their huge party organisations. But when people directly elect presidents and chief ministers their grip over party organisations can’t be decisive in national politics. For that we have to amend the constitution.However, again, an expert team needs to thoroughly study the pros and cons of such changes. But what I can say based on the general study of public perception is that we can first go for direct election of executive heads at the provincial level. In the next phase we can go for direct presidential election at the federal level.What went wrong in the practice of the three-tier federal system?While adopting federalism, the basic idea was to allow the local governments to oversee local matters while the provincial governments would handle wide ranges of issues related to agriculture, industry, forest, education and health, etcetera. If the two sub-national governments handle these things, people don’t need to come to the centre seeking solutions to their problems. In such a scenario, the federal government can focus on important affairs such as foreign relations, defence, telecommunication, currency, national infrastructure projects and inter-provincial affairs. Such division of powers would automatically create specialisation in the respective governments.But the federal system is not implemented as per that spirit. Provinces aren’t allowed to exercise their rights. People are still travelling to Kathmandu all the way from remote districts even for basic things. The constitution has mandated the provinces to maintain law and order in their respective provinces but the federal government hasn’t allowed them to have their own police forces. Provinces without police have become like administrative units. The centre has a huge bureaucracy in Kathmandu. It is high time that the centre delegates authority to provinces as per the constitutional spirit. Federal lawmakers have huge interest in local development activities because it is directly related to their election. They don’t want to lose this influence. The interest of federal lawmakers however contradicts with the constitution.There is also a belief that the local level has authority in areas where they can’t work effectively, for instance they are mandated to oversee the education system up to grade 12 while provinces don’t have much role. Do you think such jurisdictional matters need to be reviewed and provinces should be given more authority?That’s right. First of all, we should be clear that there is no point in adopting a federal system if we don’t want provinces because we had central and local levels even in the past. Provincial layer is an integral part of federalism. So, we have to think about transferring certain rights from local to provincial level because the local units don’t have expertise to oversee education up to grade 12 on their own. Our local units are traditionally trained in local development activities. But now they are entrusted with the responsibility of not only overseeing education and health issues but also with legislative and judicial functions. They haven’t been able to play that role. We should think about transferring some roles from local to provincial levels. Likewise, the centre should be ready to allow the provinces to exercise their rights bestowed by the constitution. It is time to strengthen the provinces.You said direct election of executive heads in provinces could end instability at the provincial level. But what if a popular leader got elected chief minister but other political parties won majority seats in the provincial assemblies? In such a situation, the rival parties may not help the chief minister pass a budget or policies from the assembly.Yes, there are strengths and weaknesses of all systems. Such problems can be resolved because we see similar situations in other countries as well. Parties can’t prolong the deadlock in the House because they will be blamed for the impasse. One basis is that our local units are doing well under executive heads. So, we can practise it for a decade in the provinces and then apply it to the federal level based on that experience.Many forces and groups that aren’t happy with the present constitution, which was basically a compromise document. Once the constitution amendment process is open, they are certain to revive their demands. Will the situation be manageable?If the rights of historically marginalised communities are curtailed, they will certainly retaliate. If you try to go against the federal republic system and policy of inclusion, it may invite new conflicts. The proportional representation system is not a problem. Leaders made it unpopular by misusing it. We should find solutions to stop its misuse. We shouldn’t forget that this constitution is not only a constitution but also a key document of our peace process. This is not perfect but it was essential to end the conflict. Many say that while making a document of compromise, our constitution hasn’t followed the principles of constitutionalism. For instance, the hearing system is something unusual in a parliamentary system. As a constitutional expert, do you think we should also think about fixing such deviations?You are right. When we couldn’t change the people, we tried to add additional features as a measure to check the wrongdoings. Our leaders make appointments in key constitutional bodies guided by their personal and partisan interests. We copied the hearing practice from the presidential system with a view to check the leaders’ arbitrary appointments. It hasn’t been that effective. Therefore, we have proposed to give continuity to the hearing for political appointments but not in the appointments of judges because lawmakers don’t have the expertise to examine judges’ competence. Since lawmakers are mainly guided by the party’s whip and top leaders’ instructions, it rather increases political interference even in the judiciary. We have thus proposed to stop the hearing process for judges’ appointments.Many say that the judiciary hasn’t been federalized even though all other sectors have been restructured as per the three-tier federal system. Why this exception for the judiciary?Oh, you dragged me to a sensitive topic. One thing we shouldn’t forget is that we adopted a federal system not to unify small countries. We were already a united country. We adopted it to better manage our social diversity by involving all the communities in the governing system. We at the same time have to safeguard the country from disintegration. Judiciary, the national army and Nepali language are our institutional arrangements that can play a unifying role. Therefore, we didn’t make much changes in these three aspects.Some instances show that Nepal’s federalism might have been a bit more effective had the judiciary worked proactively. For instance, the court hasn’t decided even the cases filed by provinces years ago. What do you think about the judiciary’s role in this connection?Yes, those cases are still undecided. In the Constituent Assembly, the Maoist party had registered a proposal to form a separate constitutional court. The justices who were leading the judiciary at the time opposed the idea. It was later rejected. Then the idea to have a separate constitutional bench was included as a compromise deal. But it has failed to work effectively. It failed to decide election-related disputes. We have to review its jurisdiction. They have decided certain cases when there is public pressure. For instance they decided cases like House dissolution because there was constant public scrutiny. But they haven’t shown any interest in other important cases where constitutional interpretation is needed. Of late, a strong opinion is being built in favour of forming a separate constitutional court. These issues are being discussed seriously. This issue may emerge if the constitution amendment process begins.What we can infer from your analysis is that the constitution amendment process is not that easy. What are the basic things that should be and can be done in the constitution amendment at this stage?First, we should change the form of governance at the provincial level and go for a directly elected executive head. With this there will be no change in government in provinces after changes at the centre. The governments in provinces can work for five years with certainty. Second, we can transfer the powers that the local units have failed to exercise to provinces. And, the centre should allow the provinces to exercise the concurrent rights. By doing this the centre can reduce the overwhelming burden on it. While the provinces can play an implementing role, the federation can play a supervisory role. These things need to be fixed. We need some amendments to the constitution and some new laws for this. \nThe weather is forecast to be partly to generally cloudy in the hilly areas of the country on Thursday with partly cloudy to mainly fair weather elsewhere.
