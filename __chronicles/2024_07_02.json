Write it in the form of inspiring story not news article or event.\n    \n    Story:\nOnce upon a time, nestled between the towering peaks of the Himalayas and the lush jungles of the Terai, there was a country named Nepal. Though still a developing nation, Nepal was a land of profound beauty and deep-rooted cultural heritage. The residents of Nepal faced many challenges, but beneath these hardships lay a resilient spirit and an unyielding hope for the future.\n\nThis enchanting land, where Mount Everest reaches towards the skies and the air carries a mix of incense and cool mountain breezes, was more than a geographical marvel. It was a mosaic of cultures, languages, and traditions, a testament to human endeavor against all odds. Nepal's history, from the unification under King Prithvi Narayan Shah to its transformation into a federal democratic republic, told a story of aspiration and endurance.\n\nIn recent years, the people of Nepal, with their indomitable will, had taken strides towards rebuilding and reimagining their country. They turned their struggles into stepping stones, each challenge a chapter in their ongoing saga. The shift from a monarchy to a republic had not only changed governance but had woven a new tapestry of democratic values and collective decision-making.\n\nEconomically, while agriculture continued to sustain a large part of its population, Nepal had begun to harness the potential of its picturesque landscapes, developing sustainable tourism that promised to preserve their natural heritage while boosting local economies. Communities living in the shadows of the Himalayas had become stewards of the earth, protecting the biodiversity that made their country unique.\n\nEach day brought new stories. Whether it was a festival in Kathmandu, a technological advance in Pokhara, or a conservation effort in Chitwan, these events were threads in the vibrant quilt of Nepali life. These stories, updated daily, reflected the pulse of progress and the spirit of hope that characterized this resilient nation.\n\nAnd so, as Nepal moved forward, each moment was not just a passage of time but a promise of potential, a narrative of a nation perennially climbing towards tomorrow, guided by the legacy of its past and the dreams of its future.\n\nNews events:\nKP Sharma Oli has pulled out yet another rabbit from his old bag of tricks. Barely four months after extending support to Pushpa Kamal Dahal’s leadership of the government, CPN-UML, the second largest party in Parliament, has decided to end its political association with Dahal and join hands with Nepali Congress, the largest party. Saturday’s apparently sudden meeting between Nepali Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba and CPN-UML chair KP Oli at the latter’s residence laid the ground for a potential new political alliance between the two parties.Multiple senior Congress and UML leaders told the Post that Deuba and Oli had already reached an understanding in a meeting on Sunday midnight at an undisclosed location in Kathmandu, where they tentatively agreed to form a new government, amend the constitution, and to work out a power-sharing formula, which they reportedly shared with a few confidants. As per the understanding between Congress and UML, Oli will lead a new ‘national consensus’ government for a year and a half. For the remaining term, Deuba will be the prime minister, a Nepali Congress leader who is preparing a draft agreement between the two parties told the Post on Monday night. A four-member task force has prepared the draft agreement, which will be released on Tuesday. It will detail the power-sharing arrangement, propose amendments to the constitution, review the electoral system including proportional representation, change national assembly arrangements, and discuss size of provincial assemblies, according to a taskforce member. Ramesh Lekhak and Gyanendra Bahadur Karki from the Congress and Shankar Pokhrel and Ramesh Badal from the UML had held several rounds of talks in the past two weeks, said a UML leader. If everything goes according to plan, a deal will be public by Tuesday, and chairman Oli will stake claim to the post of prime minister on Tuesday itself, a UML minister said. Two Congress leaders familiar with the meeting as per the understanding between Oli and Deuba, Oli will lead the new government with the support of Nepali Congress and other fringe parties. The Congress will lead 10 ministries including home, and the UML nine including finance, as per the draft understanding. Likewise, the Congress and the UML will lead three provincial governments each, with the government in Madhesh to be led by a regional party. There has also been a verbal agreement on formation of a high-powered constitution review and suggestions committee under a former chief justice of the Supreme Court. Deuba and Oli had reportedly been in talks over the past one month in order to address some pressing national issues, and have agreed to amend the constitution where needed. They are also said to have reached understandings on foreign policy, economic crisis, and governance.One big issue that is said to have caused a rift between Prime Minister Dahal and Oli was over the appointment of the chairman of the Securities Board of Nepal or Sebon. The appointment process was ultimately cancelled on Saturday due to differences between the two leaders.Sources inside the Finance Ministry said the selection process became the victim of the political power play between the UML and the Maoist Centre, leading to the cancellation of the entire process.But after a meeting between the two on Monday morning, a Cabinet meeting later in the day decided to give continuity to the old three-member committee to nominate candidates for Sebon chair.Some media reports tried to link the latest Deuba-Oli meeting with yet another development, as it took place a day after Nepal Police arrested Bechan Jha, one of the alleged middlemen in the high-profile Bhutanese refugee scam.Police last year filed cases against politicians, bureaucrats and middlemen on charges of defrauding hundreds of people by promising to send them to the US as Bhutanese refugees. But police were not able to book Jha despite his connection with the scam.Jha is allegedly close to many political leaders, including senior Congress leaders, and the Congress leadership might have been worried that they too could be dragged into the refugee scam.Differences between Oli and Dahal had been steadily building, including over the new Sebon chair, the appointment of ambassadors to eight countries, transitional justice, and the bringing of what Oli termed a ‘Maoist budget’ for the new fiscal year. During their meeting on Monday morning, Oli reportedly requested Dahal to support him by stepping down. “I had serious discussions with Nepali Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba on the formation of a new government in order to make some changes to the constitution and to address some pressing national issues,” a UML leader quoted Oli as telling him. According to the UML leader, Dahal offered Oli the post of prime minister within the current ruling coalition, but Oli politely turned down the offer. The UML chair instead expressed his desire to lead a consensus government, the UML leader told the Post.Deuba and Oli were in talks for a month through different channels. After several rounds of back-channel talks and negotiations between the second-ranking leaders of the Nepali Congress and UML, they finally agreed to meet.According to the two UML leaders who were briefed about the latest situation, time has come to form a government based on national consensus in order to address the country’s daunting challenges.Prime Minister Dahal had called a meeting of ruling partners for 5:00 pm on Monday, but the meeting had to be postponed in light of the new situation. Dahal, who was all set to reshuffle the Cabinet, was planning to discuss the same in the meeting.   \nNepali Congress once again has reiterated that Nepal is not interested in loan funding of Belt and Road Initiatives (BRI) projects. Party spokesperson Parkash Saran Mahat said that after a meeting of the party's office bearers and former office bearers on Monday, the party concluded that Nepal should only accept grants, not loans for implementing BRI projects. “The debt burden is already high, so the party has decided that further debt should not be taken for implementing BRI projects,” he said. During the 16th round of the Nepal-China diplomatic consultation mechanism meeting, held on June 25 in Kathmandu, the two parties had planned to finalise the BRI implementation plan, but they could not agree on the modality for financing projects. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Nepal corresponded with the Prime Minister’s Office to seek approval for signing the implementation plan during the diplomatic consultation mechanism meeting attended by Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Sun Weidong, but it failed. The Congress, however, has been vocal in advocating for grants to implement BRI projects. During the Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi’s Nepal visit in March 2022, then Prime Minister Deuba had conveyed that Nepal would not implement BRI projects through loans. Congress leaders also said that President Sher Bahadur Deuba, during his meeting with CPN-UML chair KP Sharma Oli at the latter’s residence in Balkot on Saturday, discussed the funding modality of BRI. The Congress, which is the largest party in Parliament, held a gathering of its sitting and former office bearers on Monday following Saturday’s meeting between party chief Deuba and UML chair Oli. While the meeting between Deuba and Oli sparked speculations about the two parties potentially cooperating to form a government, the Congress leaders, after Monday’s meeting, dismissed such a possibility anytime soon. Congress spokesman Mahat categorically denied that the issue of Congress-UML collaboration on the government was discussed at Monday’s meeting. But he did not rule out the possibility of the two parties coming together in the future. Mahat outlined the conditions under which the two largest parties in the parliament could potentially collaborate: a stable and effective government, resolution of election-related challenges, and a clear path towards national stability and prosperity. “The Congress party believes that political issues should take precedence over the government’s role,” Mahat said. “On cooperation, our party is open to cooperating with all parties on pressing national issues.”He also said that the party is in discussion not just with the UML, but also with other parties for possible cooperation.However, a close ally of Deuba claimed that during the Saturday meeting, Deuba proposed Oli as the prime minister for the first round should the two parties cooperate to form a new government.  “As far as I know, Deuba is not in the mood to be prime minister at the moment,” the Congress leader who was present at the office bearer and former office bearer meeting on Monday told the Post. “In such circumstances, if two parties come together to form a government, Oli would lead it first.” A government of the two parties might be formed, but not in the next few days, said the Congress leader. Similarly, the Congress meeting on Monday also decided to extend the tenures of its sister organisation by six months. Their terms were expiring on July 4. “Today’s meeting decided to extend the terms of the sister organisations so that they can elect new office bearers within six months,” Jeevan Pariyar, the Deputy General Secretary of the party, told the Post. Meanwhile, Pariyar also said that the meeting decided to send the report of the party’s Mahasamiti meeting in February to the central committee for approval with amendments. During the Mahasamiti meeting, Vice-President Purna Bahadur Khadka had presented a policy document, General Secretary Gagan Thapa had proposed organisational reforms, General Secretary Bishwa Parkash Sharma had presented a document on contemporary political issues, and spokesperson Prakash Sharan Mahat a document on the economic situation, prospects and future direction. General Secretary Thapa's proposal drew controversy within the party. In it, he urged the party to contest the upcoming election on its own strength without forming any electoral alliance. Later, on March 4, the CPN (Maoist Centre) ditched its collaboration with the Congress and brought the UML into the government. The party pointed to Thapa’s proposal as a reason for a change in the ruling coalition.  \nIn 2019-20, Nepal imported 236 units of passenger electric vehicles (EVs) from China worth some Rs674 million. In the past five years, imports of EVs from China jumped 35 times, suggesting EV adoption in Nepal is now outpacing that of conventional combustion vehicles which use engines that burn fossil fuels, such as petrol or diesel. The EVs have overtaken conventional combustion vehicles.The imports of fossil fuel-consuming passenger vehicles were 10,310 units worth Rs9.24 billion in 2019-20. After four years, in the first 11 months of the current fiscal year, imports of conventional combustion vehicles were down to 3,537 units worth Rs4.21 billionHowever, overall vehicle imports have jumped from Rs65.02 billion in 2019-20 to Rs80 billion in the first 11 months of 2023-24.According to the Department of Customs, Nepal imported 11,466 units of EVs worth Rs29 billion in the first 11 months of the current fiscal year, or by mid-June. The imports were 3,870 units worth Rs11.23 billion in the same period last fiscal year. Of the total EV imports, a third came from China. Customs data show that Nepal imported 7,931 units of EVs from China, accounting for 69 percent of the total EV imports in the first 11 months of the current fiscal year. This translates to Rs21 billion in value.After China, the majority of EVs were imported from India. In the review period, imports from India amounted to Rs6 billion, or 3,277 units. Until the last fiscal year, India was Nepal's top EV supplier.The data show that Nepal imported 2,205 EVs worth Rs5.94 billion from India in the last fiscal year. In the same period, imports from China were 1,269 units worth Rs3.75 billion.Nepal’s imports of EVs jumped sharply by 158.23 percent in the first 11 months of the current fiscal year. Importers say BYD, a Chinese multinational, has taken over the Nepali market. The government collected revenue of Rs13.06 billion from the import of EVs in the review period.Akash Golchha, senior vice president of the Nepal Automobile Dealers Association, said the ongoing economic slowdown has not stopped Nepalis from buying EVs. However, petrol or diesel-run vehicle sales could have been better.EV sales and orders saw a dramatic surge before the budget was announced on May 28.Cimex Inc Pvt Ltd, the authorised distributor of BYD Auto Industry Co Ltd in Nepal, said it had achieved a milestone by delivering 50 cutting-edge BYD EVs in a single day on May 18. According to the company, all 50 units were sold from its service centre at Guheshwari, Kathmandu.According to Cimex, the company imported 4,000 EVs in the first 11 months of the current fiscal year. The import of Chinese EVs is high due to their larger production compared to India, said the company, which is among the top EV brands in Nepal. BYD’s Atto and Dolphin are the most preferred models among Nepali customers. With the recent hike in excise and customs duties, the company said the new price list of BYDs will be unveiled soon.“There was fear among buyers that the government may raise duty on EVs in the budget. As a result, the demand surged dramatically,” said Golchha. “The high import increased the stock of EVs.” Automobile dealers said that the government hiked the duty on EVs by 10 percent in the budget for the coming fiscal year 2024-25, which, however, may not impact the sales.Golchha said the government did not make drastic changes in the import duty of EVs in the budget, which may help EV sales boom in the coming days. “The EV demand will grow at a faster pace.”Auto dealers say the import boost for EVs is mainly due to banks’ easy financing. Banks lend up to 90 percent of the vehicle's cost.Finance Minister Barsha Man Pun, in the annual budget for the upcoming fiscal year, revised the customs and excise duty rates on the import of EVs. The customs duty on EVs of up to 50 kW has been increased to 15 percent from 10 percent, while a 5 percent excise duty has been imposed on them.Likewise, the government increased the customs and excise duties on EVs of 50-100 kW by 5 percent. As per the revised tariffs, the customs duty has been increased to 20 percent from 15 percent, while the excise duty has been increased to 15 percent from 10 percent.The customs duty on 100-200 kW has been raised to 30 percent from 20 percent. Similarly, those in categories 200-300 kW and more than 300 KW will be subject to customs duty of 60 percent and 80 percent, respectively. In these vehicles, the indirect tax has been raised by 20 percent each.According to EV traders, the market is flooded with various EV models, features, and looks, and customers have options to select according to their needs. They said that EVs ranging from Rs4 million to Rs5.5 million have a large customer base, while high-priced EVs are also seeing good sales.EV traders said that despite the market slowdown, the EV sector has not been affected.“One interesting emerging trend is that people who already own conventional combustion vehicles are also buying EVs,” said Golchha. \nThe Sarlahi District Court on Monday sentenced Ram Bahadur Bomjan, a controversial ‘spiritual leader’, to 10 years in jail for child sex abuse.A single bench of Judge Jeevan Kumar Bhandari announced the jail term and also slapped a Rs500,000 fine for Bomjan, the court’s registrar Sadan Adhikari told the Post.The bench on June 24 convicted Bomjan and scheduled a hearing for Monday to determine the punishment.The court acquitted Bomjan’s two aides, Jit Bahadur Tamang and Gyan Bahadur Bomjan, in the same case.Bomjan, who was dubbed ‘Buddha Boy’ by some international media, is under judicial custody at Jaleshwar jail. On January 11, a bench of Judge Bishnu Prasad Regmi had sent him to judicial custody.A team from the Central Investigation Bureau of Nepal Police on January 9 arrested Bomjan from a house in Budhanilkantha, Kathmandu.Bomjan had been in hiding since the District Court, Sarlahi, on February 6, 2020, issued an arrest warrant against him as per a police request. In July 2020, a case of sexual abuse was filed against him in the District Court, Sarlahi.In the chargesheet, the District Attorney Office, Sarlahi, had demanded 12–15 years of prison for Bomjan and his two aides for their alleged involvement in the sexual exploitation of the minor.The chargesheet accuses Bomjan, the prime suspect, of raping a 15-year-old girl who was staying in his ashram (hermitage) at Pattharkot, Sarlahi, as an Ani (nun).Police in the chargesheet accused Bomjan of raping the minor by luring her to his private quarters at 9:20pm on August 4, 2016.He has further been charged with threatening the girl with consequences if she disclosed the incident to others.On February 23, 2020, after the victim turned 18, a complaint against him was registered at the District Police Office in Sarlahi.On June 18, 2020, a team from the CIB raided his ashram in ward 8 of Kamalamai Municipality in Sindhuli district but he was not found there. Police suspected he might have fled the place.Five families have filed complaints against him in different police offices, accusing him of murder, disappearance and sexual exploitation of his followers. The accusations regarding the disappearances of his followers are still awaiting trial.Bomjan shot to fame in 2005 after reportedly meditating for months without food, water, or sleep, leading the media to dub him the ‘Buddha Boy’. After emerging from his meditation, he and his followers set up ashrams in Bara, Sarlahi, Sindhupalchok and Sindhuli districts, where the abuses took place, the police said. \nOver the past five years, 449 individuals in Madhesh Province, Nepal, have died from electric shock incidents attributed to electrical negligence and careless use of electricity.\nParopakar Maternity and Women’s Hospital has emphasized the need for mental health screening training for all healthcare workers to address rising maternal deaths due to mental health issues during pregnancy.\nDespite being elected over a year ago, thematic committees in Nepal's Parliament lack momentum, hindering their oversight role and raising concerns about resource shortages and potential external influence.\nThe 2005 establishment of Aid for Trade (AfT) recognized the need for support to developing and least-developed countries in building trade capacity, with a focus on addressing trade-related constraints, particularly for LDCs.\nAs monsoons bring heavy rainfall in Nepal, the need for impact-based forecasting and anticipatory actions (AA) becomes crucial to mitigate disaster risks by providing early warnings and guiding timely responses.\nDespite federal mandates, the central government in Nepal maintains tight control over provinces, limiting their autonomy and hindering the establishment of their own police forces.\nIn the Copa America, Uruguay defeated the host US 1-0, eliminating them in the first round and advancing as group winners, while Panama qualified as runners-up in Group C.\nKey events unfold, shaping the narrative and revealing the characters' motivations and conflicts.\nTuesday's forecast predicts cloudy weather with rain, thunder, and lightning, including heavy rainfall in several provinces, and a risk of very heavy rainfall in some areas, with a generally cloudy night featuring light to moderate rainfall and chances of heavy rainfall in isolated locations.\nSiddhartha Art Gallery's exhibition of Patachitra, Bilampau, and Kalighat paintings explores the evolution of folk art, showcases the subversion of gender norms, and invites questions about the complexities and interpretations of feminism.\nIndia enacts new criminal laws replacing colonial-era legislation, replacing sedition law with sovereignty protection, prompting mixed reactions from government and opposition.\nNepalese police arrested 20 individuals, including foreigners, in connection with a 3,194 kg gold smuggling case worth $250 million, involving payment gateways and concealment in motorcycle brake pads and electronics.\nSeven Star International Travel and Tours launched their user-friendly online travel platform, www.esevenstar.com, on June 27th, granting customers access to their modern services and global reach.\nHouse of Representatives Speaker Devraj Ghimire recommended former government secretary Suresh Adhikari for the vacant secretary position after Padma Prasad Pandey's promotion to General Secretary.\nPolitical quotas and compromise have led to frequent and controversial ambassadorial recalls, with appointments made on the basis of loyalty rather than merit, hindering Nepal's diplomatic stability and consistency.\nOn March 15 last year, China reopened its borders for travel, ending a three-year closure during the Covid pandemic. As soon as the borders—land and air—opened, and the China-funded international airport in Pokhara was inaugurated, optimism was high. Before the pandemic, market insiders predicted a dramatic surge in Chinese tourists, who were Nepal’s second-largest source market after India before the Covid-19 pandemic. It didn’t happen. Nepal received 60,878 Chinese tourists in 2023, a recovery by a third from the pre-pandemic level when Chinese tourists boomed in Nepal.In the first five months (January–May) of this year, Nepal received 46,671 Chinese, with the highest arrival of 12,093 recorded in March. While Chinese arrivals slowed, Indian tourists boomed in Nepal, reaching an all-time high of 319,936 individuals, according to the Department of Immigration. Among Indians, only those who come by air are counted as tourists in Nepal. In the first five months, Nepal has received 148,861 Indian tourists, the highest number of 38,288 recorded in May. Before the pandemic, India and China were competing neck-to-neck. Now, there is a huge imbalance between the south and north.Will it change? On Monday, during the 16th round of the Nepal-China diplomatic consultation mechanism meeting held in Kathmandu, Beijing made a surprise announcement.It announced plans to promote Nepali tourism in China as part of celebrating 2025 as ‘Visit Nepal Year in China’, which Nepal’s top travel trade entrepreneurs say is a “big statement.” They say they had never before heard China favour any country with such soft power diplomacy.Will 2025 be the year for the potential great return of Chinese tourists then? “So far, I haven’t heard or seen Beijing promote any country’s tourism inside China. This is, in fact, a good gesture of neighbourliness,” said Kishore Raj Pandey, chairman of Saathi Nepal Travel and Tours, who was the first person to bring Chinese tourists to Nepal in 2001.“If it has been announced, Beijing indeed has some policy to encourage Chinese citizens to travel to Nepal.”Tourism is vital for Nepal’s economy. According to the recently released annual World Travel and Tourism Council research report, Nepal’s tourism sector generated Rs327.9 billion ($2.5 billion) in revenue and supported 1.19 million jobs directly and indirectly last year. The report forecasts that Nepal will generate 1.22 million jobs in 2024. Last year, the country received 1 million tourists.Some critics say it’s a lofty promise. Before Monday’s meeting, during the third Nepal Investment Summit held in Kathmandu on April 28, Luo Zhaohui, chairman of the China International Development Cooperation Agency, announced the waiver of visa fees for Nepalis.It was implemented on May 1. There was another announcement, too.“The Chinese government is making arrangements to start new flights from China to Nepal’s two new international airports—Pokhara and Lumbini,” Luo said while addressing the summit.Nepal’s $216 million international airport in Pokhara, the country’s tourism capital, opened in January last year. Beijing financed it.Similarly, Nepal’s second international airport in Bhairahawa, built by Chinese contractors, started operating in May 2022 after four years of construction delays. The objectives of both projects are to decentralise economic activities in the new federal setup, attract more tourists, and prevent Nepalis from going abroad.But only some international flights are operating in the two new shiny airports.“Under Beijing's renewed diplomacy, there is a possibility of the operation of these two new international airports,” said Basant Raj Mishra, a senior tourism entrepreneur. “Once flights from China come, it will create competition.”He said Beijing’s announcement represents a great opportunity for Nepal. “We should be prepared for joint marketing and promotional activities. With a proper policy, we can attract 1 million tourists from China alone in 2025. And for this, we need enhanced flight connectivity.”China is facing many economic obstacles, but Beijing remains optimistic about growth.Reports show that Chinese tourists hit the road in significant numbers during the recent five-day Labor holidays in May but kept a tight grip on their wallets, reflecting still-weak sentiment in the world’s second-largest economy.According to a statement from China’s Ministry of Culture and Tourism, travellers made 28.2 percent more trips, but spending only rose 13.5 percent from the 2019 break. “Of all the countries, China has the largest number of airlines connecting Nepal but brings the lowest number of tourists,” said Vijay Shrestha, vice president (Administration) at Himalaya Airlines, the Nepal-Tibet joint venture. There are five airlines currently connecting China. “The traffic is low,” said Shrestha. “It may be due to low consumer confidence.”Himalaya Airlines has suspended Kathmandu-Beijing flights, and Kathmandu-Shanghai flights are also irregular due to low passenger traffic. Besides, in the other three sectors, the average occupancy is 40 percent,” said Shrestha. “The announcement from Beijing to promote Nepal in China could change that.”Nepal and China established formal diplomatic relations in 1955, and Nepal-Tibet trade goes a long way back. In 1956, four cities of Tibet, namely Lhasa, Shigatse, Gyantse, and Yatung, were designated as major trading cities for Nepali traders.Between the founding of the People’s Republic of China in 1949 and 1982, few residents of China travelled to foreign destinations other than government officials, students, and a few businessmen. In 1983, China allowed citizens from Guangdong Province to travel to the British colony of Hong Kong on organised tours to visit family.Beginning in 1995, the Chinese National Tourism Administration formalised China’s Approved Destination Status (ADS) policy.The history of Chinese tourism in Nepal is not long either. Nepal first participated in the China International Travel Fair in 2000 to promote its tourism sector. Before 2000, the Chinese could only travel to Nepal on official visits.The Chinese government had permitted ADS for Chinese outbound travellers in November 2001. The two countries signed an initial memorandum of understanding on an implementation plan for outbound travel by Chinese people to Nepal on April 16, 2001, laying the groundwork for the ADS.Nepal was given the Approved Destination Status (ADS) by its northern neighbour in 2002, and in June of the same year, Chinese citizens began visiting Nepal officially for the first time as tourists. Nepal was the 18th nation to receive the status and first in South Asia. In 2002, Nepal got 8,715 Chinese tourists.Subsequently, the central banks of the two countries signed an agreement on bilateral cooperation that allowed the Chinese currency to be converted into Nepali rupees in a bid to boost bilateral trade, tourism, and economic cooperation.However, immediately after Nepal received the ADS, arrivals from China fell due to a violent conflict that intensified over 2002-2004, reaching Nepal’s main cities and tourist destinations. Nepal eventually started witnessing a constant growth in Chinese arrivals after June 2009.Chinese arrivals to Nepal crossed the 100,000 mark for the first time in 2013, mainly due to the improved air links between the two countries. According to the tourism ministry’s statistics, around 93 percent of Chinese tourists were first-time visitors to Nepal.In 2014, Nepal received 123,805 Chinese visitors.The 2015 earthquake and India's blockade led to arrivals from China dropping to a four-year low of 64,675 individuals in 2015, down 47.76 percent from 2014.The surface road at the Tatopani border point, where Nepal used to receive many Chinese tourists, was also blocked.On December 25, 2015, Nepal announced ‘free visa’ for Chinese tourists, giving them the same treatment accorded to South Asian visitors. In a bid to revive flagging arrivals, the scheme was implemented in January 2016.Thereon, tourist arrivals from China started rising steadily, and Nepal saw the strongest growth, 46.8 percent, in tourist arrivals from China, with the overall number reaching 153,633 visitors in 2018.In 2019, Nepal received a record 169,543 Chinese tourists.The number fell to 19,257 in 2020. In 2021 and 2022, there were 6,198 and 9,599 Chinese tourists in Nepal—mainly diplomats and those stranded in third countries—who came to Nepal when Beijing enforced never-ending lockdowns.When the Chinese economy started to boom again, Nepali investors pumped money into luxury hotels, which too have multiplied. \nLast month, a local from Sindhupalchowk district was brought to Sukraraj Tropical and Infectious Disease Hospital to treat a snakebite. Along with the victim, relatives brought the live snake in a bottle to show the doctor as proof.“The snake was a king cobra,” said Dr Yuba Nidhi Basaula, director at the Hospital. “Fortunately, the venom had not penetrated deep into the victim’s body, and after three days of treatment, the victim was discharged. We called a snake handler and handed over the king cobra.”Sindhupalchowk is a mountain district where venomous snakes were thought of as non-existent. However, incidents of king cobra bites in mountain districts like Sindhupalchowk suggest that venomous snakes have started migrating towards hill and mountain districts, and rising temperatures caused by climate change are the main culprit, experts say.Nepal is among the world’s most vulnerable countries to the climate crisis and has witnessed multiple extreme weather events over the past decade and a half.Evidence suggests that maximum temperatures in Nepal are rising at a faster rate of 0.056 degrees Celsius a year, compared to the global average rise of 0.03 degrees Celsius a year. Compared to districts of the Tarai region, those in hills and mountains have been witnessing a more rapid increase in daytime maximum temperatures, which could have helped venomous snakes survive there, experts say.“Not only in Sindhupalchowk, but a king cobra bite was also spotted in Godawari of Lalitpur district last year,” said Basaula. “Snakebite cases have started rising alarmingly of late.”Of the 31 patients admitted to the hospital on Sunday, 16—more than 50 percent—were snakebite cases. Doctors at the hospital say eight to ten snakebite victims seek treatment there every day, and most victims seeking care at the hospital are from the districts of Kathmandu Valley or from those adjoining the Valley.Each year, around 2,700 people, mostly children and women from Nepal’s Tarai region, die of snakebites, according to a March 2022 report published in The Lancet, a leading international medical journal.However, snakebite cases are vastly underreported in the country. The Ministry of Health and Population said that only 14 deaths and 1,220 cases of snakebites had been reported in 11 months of the current fiscal year. Officials admit that venomous snakebite incidents are being reported from hill and mountain districts, and the demand for anti-snake venom is on the rise. They attribute this rise in snakebite incidents to rising temperatures. “Health facilities in some mountainous and hilly districts—like Darchula and Bajura—have asked for anti-snake venom,” said Dr Hemanta Chandra Ojha, an official at the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division. “Snakebite incidents have been on the rise,” said Dr Hemanta Chandra Ojha, an official at the division. “With the onset of the monsoon, people living in the risk areas should remain vigilant.”Every year, the Health Ministry purchases around 25,000 vials of anti-snake venom and distributes them to around 100 snakebite treatment centres in the country.Officials say as snakebite cases surge, so will the demand for additional treatment centres. “This year, we are planning to set up an additional 15 snakebite treatment centres,” said Ojha. Public health experts have urged authorities to launch an awareness drive about the risks. They say people living in thatched-roof houses are particularly vulnerable to snakebites, as snakes often enter such homes in search of rats. They say people should be asked to keep their homes and surroundings clean, prevent children from playing in bushy areas, avoid venturing out at night, and use torchlights while walking in the dark.Likewise, women and children who have to work in fields and go to the jungle are at the highest risk of snakebites. Small children are at risk of dying from snakebites, as they do not tell their parents about the bites on time due to fear of getting scolded for playing in the bushes, according to doctors.“We should make people aware so that they seek medical attention immediately after a snakebite, using whatever means of transport they get,” said Ojha. “The faster you reach the hospital, the greater your chances of survival.” \nThe duel between Kathmandu’s 34-year-old mayor Balendra Shaha (popularly called Balen), a structural engineer, reputed rapper and political novice, and 72-year-old Khagda Prasad Sharma Oli, a high school dropout, two-time prime minister, political veteran and chairperson of the Communist Party of Nepal (United Marxist Leninist) is a caricature of contemporary Nepali politics marred by the conflict between the old and the young. The duel has attracted numerous newspaper articles, set social media on fire and provided YouTubers a field day. What is Oli’s motive in mobilising his whole party to attack Balen, and what is Balen—a lone man with no political experience and political following—doing picking a fight with Oli? How will the duel impact Oli’s party and Balen’s aspirations going forward? The fightThe Balen-Oli fight began when the metropolitan city started to clear buildings built illegally on municipal land or business advertisements that did not comply with municipal regulations. The city would order the current occupants of the offending buildings or business owners to comply with the law and vacate the premises. In most cases, the occupants would ignore the order. Like in old times, they relied on their political connections to continue to subvert the law. However, that did not work with Balen. He sent municipal forces to demolish the encroachment and non-compliant adverts. The first property subjected to the mayor's action belonged to someone connected to the UML. Soon after the clearance, a Central Committee member of the UML, Mahesh Basnet, called upon his minions to physically harm Balen if he did not “mend his ways”.Balen’s attempt to clean up Kathmandu from squatters occupying public land, particularly river banks, intensified the conflict. Oli publicly mocked Balen for using bulldozers to demolish plastic shades built by “poor squatters.” Some “squatters” are believed to occupy multistory buildings constructed on public land and own businesses worth millions of rupees. The majority of them are UML voters, “UMLs’ vote bank”, observed a Balen supporter. The squatter problem is not new. All previous governments, including the one led by Oli, recognised it. The conflict became increasingly acrimonious when Balen opened the basement of Dharahara for car parking. The government objected, arguing that the reconstruction of Dharahara is still incomplete and the car park is unsafe to use. Balen retorted, “Dharahara was inaugurated as a completed project by Prime Minister Oli before the last election. How can it be incomplete?” The inauguration of the work-in-progress was one of Prime Minister Oli’s pre-election charades. The car park is safe and currently in use; the reconstruction continues. The recent New Road imbroglio added fuel to the fire. Balen started widening the footpath on New Road to comply with the standards set by the Nepal Department of Roads (NDR). A local ward chair, a UML member, objected and complained to the Ministry of Physical Infrastructure and Transport headed by Deputy Prime Minister Ragubhir Mahaseth, an Oli acolyte. The NDR, which reports to Mahaseth, issued a “stop work” order. Incensed, Balen asked Oli to expeditiously arrange repayment for those who cheated the so-called Giri Bandhu Tea Estate land plotting scandal. Oli’s apparatchiks compared Balen to “a puppy” (a good-for-nothing weakling) and chastised him for maligning “our respected Chairman”. Oli himself has described Balen as a “bubble” which will fizzle out in no time. The fightersOli is old, witty, foxy, prickly, intolerant of criticism and, like all other politicians, corrupt in the public eye. As enunciated during his premiership, his vision of economic development includes building view towers, providing Kathmandu households with piped gas within six months, and building facilities for maritime trade—the latter two unachievable pipe dreams or political ploys. Balen is young, angry, ambitious, audacious, brash, bold, impulsive, focussed and untainted by corruption. His vision for Kathmandu is to make it a clean, functioning, beautiful heritage city. In about two years since he became mayor, Kathmandu has become relatively cleaner and greener. Its roads are rid of perpetual potholes; its sidewalks are walkable; teaching standards in public schools have improved; private schools who were short-changing on paying taxes have been forced to pay their share; emergency ambulance service has become more dependable, and so on. All of the above, despite a lack of support from political parties and the government. Parties do not support him because his success will spotlight their past failures. Despite the odds, his accomplishments have made him hugely popular throughout the country. “If we have ten leaders like Balen, we can change the country,” an exuberant Kathmandu taxi driver told me. Even the international press has taken note of Balen’s leadership. The New York Times published a story on Balen last year. He was named one of the 100 upcoming leaders in 2023 by the internationally known Time Magazine, published in the US. Balen’s public support is so visceral that he gets away even with outrageous comments like “burning Singha Durbar’, Nepal’s central secretariat, the office of Nepal’s Ministries, and irrelevant dragging of Oli into the “Giri Bandhu Tea Estate” scandal, and other similar outbursts. Although the overwhelming support for such comments on social media is surprising, it is indicative of the intensity of public dislike of established politicians.The future Balen knows that he owes his popularity as much to his performance as his refusal to bow down to political pressure and to stay clean from corruption scandals. In the two years since he assumed office, he has given confidence to the city dwellers that with exemplary leadership, the city and the country can be changed. His future depends on whether he can continue to ignore political pressure and demonstrate his perseverance, will, guts and vision to turn chaotic Kathmandu into a livable metropolis. As for Oli, UML lost the last election in Kathmandu because its mayor, a UML member, was a dismal failure. The confrontation with Balen for political upmanship and ego inflation will unlikely win Kathmandu for him. Cooperation may work better than confrontation.    \nRSP General Secretary Mukul Dhakal advocates for collaboration with independent forces like Balen Shah and Gopi Hamal, criticizing the incompatibility between new and traditional political forces in their positions on working together.\n**Summary:** Key events include battles, treaties, technological advancements, political changes, and cultural milestones.\n**Summarization:** [Key event 1] occurs, leading to [key event 2], ultimately resulting in [consequences or impact].\nSri Lanka, boasting rich culture, natural resources, and diverse experiences, is bouncing back from a financial crisis due to increased tourism.\nEducation in Every Home’s report titled ‘Diversity, Equity and Inclusion in Nepal’s Textbooks’ highlights the lack of diversity, inclusivity, and inaccuracies in these textbooks.  The findings include egregious mistakes in textbooks like the inclusion of a letter Abraham Lincloln supposedly wrote—dating to a time 17 years after his assassination, to assertions like Brazil has tigers, elephants and rhinos while Germany has tigers and monkeys. The books display a clear bias in favour of Brahmin Chhetri males, while women make up just 18 percent of all people profiled.

Sunita Dangol of the CPN-UML secured the position of KMC deputy mayor in the same election. When they began their term, many suspected that the two—an independent mayor and his party-affiliated deputy—wouldn’t have cordial relations. But, in the last two years of their term, there has been no visible disagreement between them. They proved their sceptics wrong.Deputy Mayor Dangol kept mum when Mayor Shah accused her party chair, KP Sharma Oli, of policy corruption in the Giri Bandhu Tea Estate land scam.Moreover, Shah expressed his anger on June 3 over the government’s intervention in his plan to widen pavements in the New Road area. Deputy Prime Minister Raghubir Mahaseth of the UML leads the Ministry of Physical Infrastructure and Transport, which maintains major roads.After the ministry intervened in the municipal plan to expand the sidewalk on New Road, Shah took to social media and wrote, “Honourable KP Oli jyu, don’t hoodwink people by engineering yet another scam to hide a scam of Rs10,000 crore [Rs100 billion].”He further added, “You have reassured those who had made advance payments to buy land of Giri Bandhu Tea Estate that they would get the land within two years.” “If one looks at the policy corruption in the tea estate, it appears not a single leaf would stir without Oli’s nod,” Shah wrote.A few days prior to the incident, Mayor Shah had engaged in a heated debate with Chinkaji Maharjan, a UML member and chairman of KMC’s ward 22, over the sidewalk expansion plan.Dangol remained quiet on the issue thus far. However, at the city council meeting on Monday, which also discussed KMC's policies and programmes for the fiscal year 2024-25, she criticised Mayor Shah for his remarks.“This should be the first time the deputy mayor opposed the public behavior and statement of the mayor,” a Kathmandu ward chairperson told the Post on the condition of anonymity.Dangol had her initial plan to contest the mayor position independently but the UML gave her the deputy mayor’s ticket.Speaking during the Monday discussion, Deputy Mayor Dangol said, addressing Mayor Shah, “Your and mine voices are being heard and watched by Nepalis worldwide. Therefore, those of us who want to come to politics should think about our expression,” Dangol remarked. “We should maintain the image and dignity of the institution we represent.”She also emphasised the need to accommodate the voices of everyone in an undertaking.Though the representatives of Kathmandu Metropolitan City claim that Dangol's Monday statement was unusual, they deny any rift between the two leaders of the local government. “City council’s is an internal meeting of the KMC where various issues arise. We settle those issues internally,” Nabin Manandhar, the KMC spokesperson and ward 17 chairman from the Nepali Congress, told the Post. “Having an opinion does not necessarily mean criticism.”Rajesh Kumar Shrestha, chair of KMC ward 19, seconded Manandhar.However, local representatives of Kathmandu have been questioning Shah for his ‘lone-wolf’ manner of leading the institution.“We should develop a working relationship that welcomes everyone’s spirit,” Dangol told the council meeting. “If one thinks they are in a position and everything should be done as they say, it will only lead to trouble.”She added, “While working in a team, we definitely have a different opinion, but different opinions should be respected.”At the meeting, referring to Mayor Shah's past statements, council member Anita Karki asked him, saying, “What if the voters of Kathmandu set ablaze the Durbar where the KMC office lies?”In September last year, when the traffic police obstructed a KMC vehicle, later known to be used by his postpartum wife, Mayor Shah provocatively wrote on Facebook, threatening to burn Singha Durbar, the federal government’s central secretariat.Traffic police, under the federal government, had stopped the vehicle to check necessary documents on a Saturday.After the incident, Shah wrote on social media warning that if the government blocked KMC's vehicles again, he would set fire to Singha Durbar.Dangol said on Monday that she believed it was wrong to write on social media or make a statement inciting people to burn the Singha Durbar or the Bagh Durbar, where the KMC office is situated.Dangol, speaking at the city council meeting, also said there should be no polarisation between the representatives who were elected to develop Kathmandu. \nA police officer, Ajit Gole, was found dead by suicide from a gunshot wound in the federal parliament building's washroom.\nPolice in Nepal arrested two individuals in Thimi for alleged cryptocurrency mining using a CTEVT lab with 64 desktops and a server, and blockchain applications were discovered during an initial investigation.\nHeavy monsoon rains, floods, and landslides have disrupted the supply chain, causing a steep rise in vegetable prices in the Kathmandu valley, making daily essentials like ginger, green chillies, tomatoes, and potatoes unaffordable for many.\nDespite official claims of national road connectivity, Simkot, Humla, remains isolated due to the lack of a bridge over the Karnali river, resulting in transportation difficulties, high costs, and inflated commodity prices in the district.\nNepal Airlines faces difficulty selling six grounded Chinese aircraft despite multiple auctions with no bids, leading to a potential scrap value sale but the airline remains hopeful for a successful third attempt.\nNeighboring India's Zika outbreak and Nepal's dengue outbreak raise concerns due to shared vectors, posing a high risk for a Zika outbreak in Nepal, as the virus can cause severe birth defects and neurological problems.\nIn June last year, a measles outbreak was reported in Kathmandu’s Gokarneshwar Municipality. Along with Kathmandu of Bagmati Province, the outbreak of the deadly disease was reported in several districts of Lumbini, Karnali, Sudurpaschim, Koshi, and Madhesh provinces.And in less than a year of that outbreak, health authorities concerned have been gearing up to declare the entire Madhesh Province fully immunised.“We are all prepared to declare the Madhesh Province fully immunised,” said Dr Abhiyan Gautam, chief of the Immunisation Section at the Family Welfare Division under the Department of Health Services. “All the districts of Madhesh Province have been already declared fully covered, and we have decided to declare the province fully immunised.”To declare an area as fully immunised, all children under 15 months old residing there must be administered all vaccines of the routine immunisation programme.Child health experts doubt the claim that all eligible children of the Madhesh Province have been administered the routine vaccines. They say the decision to declare a fully immunised province could raise a sense of complacency in the public, which will ultimately backfire.“Most of the districts across the country have already been declared fully immunised, and the fact is outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases, including measles, keep getting reported,” said Dr Shyam Raj Upreti, former director general at the Department of Health Services. “Declaration of a fully immunised province could create a sense of complacency in the public. We also declared the entire country open-defecation-free years ago, but outbreaks of waterborne diseases, including diarrhoea and cholera, have not stopped.”Experts say many districts across the country have already been declared fully literate but it’s hard to believe that all the districts are indeed fully literate.“For the last four months, we have been launching extensive vaccination programmes to achieve the target of a fully immunised province,” said Dr Rajiv Jha, chief of the Provincial Health Directorate of Madhesh Province. “We have also carried out the survey and found 100 percent of children between 15 to 23 months are immunised.”Experts, however, say it is impossible to achieve fully immunised status, as babies are born every hour and every day. Coverage of most health programmes is low in Madhesh Province compared to districts of other provinces. People of certain communities go to maternal homes for child delivery and return months after, and the risk of missing the routine vaccination is high there, according to them.Vaccine coverage is low among people living along the Nepal-India border who keep travelling to India frequently. Most of them opt out of vaccine programmes run by both Nepal and India. Health experts say low vaccination coverage, internal migration, a lack of awareness of importance of vaccines, and government apathy are among the reasons for regular outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases.“Due to cross border movements, the trend to go to maternal homes for child delivery, lack of awareness about the importance of vaccination and hygiene and sanitation conditions, risk of children missing routine vaccines is high in Madhesh Province,” said Upreti. “More than the declaration of full immunisation, sustaining that status is very crucial. Childhood vaccination is a continuous process, which never ends, meaning that the target is never achieved.”The Nepal Demographic and Health Survey-2022, carried out by the Ministry of Health and Population, showed that at least four percent of children aged 12 to 23 months have received no vaccination.The number of children missing basic antigens in the routine immunisation programme in Madhesh Province was also staggering. According to the report, the immunisation coverage rate in Madhesh Province is only 68 percent, which means 32 percent of children in the province didn’t take all the vaccines. It is the lowest of all the seven provinces.The government provides 13 types of vaccines through the national immunisation programme. Gandaki Province has a 93 percent vaccine coverage rate, the highest in the country. The vaccine coverage in Sudurpaschim Province, which is considered less developed and less educated, is 89 percent.The vaccination coverage rate is 81 percent in Koshi, 83 percent in Bagmati, 85 percent in Lumbini, and 84 percent in Karnali Province.Immunisation is considered the most cost-effective and efficient way to control and eliminate vaccine-preventable diseases that contribute to childhood illnesses and deaths. \nAt least 1,072 people from across the country have been infected with A(H1N1), also known as the swine flu virus, since January, this year.Data provided by the National Public Health Laboratory shows that 373 others were infected with the influenza B virus, 75 with the A (H3) virus, also known as Hong Kong Flu, 13 with co-infection of swine flu and coronavirus, and two with co-infection of influenza B and coronavirus. What concerns public virologists and infectious disease experts in Nepal is that less than one-fifth of cases of influenza-like illnesses are diagnosed, and neither the doctors attending patients nor the authorities concerned bother to know the real cause of ailments. They say that of the swab samples of 8,739 people with an influenza-like illness, only 1,743 tested positive for various kinds of influenza. “The cause of ailments of the rest of people are not known, which should be a cause of serious concern to the researchers as well as policymakers,” said Dr Sher Bahadur Pun, chief of the Clinical Research Unit at Sukraraj Tropical and Infectious Disease Hospital. “The criteria for collecting the swab samples for influenza test is that patients should have an influenza-like illness, but only less than one-fifth of samples are testing positive for influenza.”The laboratory only maintains a record of the positive cases but does not tell anything about fatalities due to infections. Experts say the number of people infected with influenza could be several times higher than the data provided by the laboratory, as many people suffering from influenza-like illness do not seek treatment. Even for those who do seek treatment, in most cases, the underlying cause of their ailments often remains undiagnosed. “The next pandemic could also be a pandemic of respiratory viruses,” said Pun. “We will not be able to lessen the risk of outbreaks in future if we continue ignoring the risks. Authorities must step up surveillance and investigate the underlying causes of these ailments.”A recent report by the Nepal Statistics Office also shows that cold and fever remain a significant concern, with an increase from 43.7 percent in 1995/96 to 51. 5 percent in 2022/23.Doctors say more people get infected with viruses during the seasonal changes, as most viruses—adenovirus, rhinovirus, influenza virus, and even coronavirus—become active during these times and winter.But this does not mean respiratory viruses do not spread at other times. “People are getting continuously infected with respiratory viruses in other seasons as well. Those with weak immunity could become more severely affected by the infection,” said Dr Raju Pangeni, a pulmonologist. “Besides urging people to take precautions against these risks, authorities must step up surveillance measures to know the real causes of influenza-like illnesses.”As very few people in Nepal receive flu shots. Experts say unvaccinated elderly people and those with compromised immunity are at risk of severe respiratory virus infections.Doctors say the influenza virus causes respiratory complications, which affect the lungs. It quickly spreads in communities. The diseases can cause fever, cough, body aches, occasional vomiting, diarrhoea and pneumonia.They say that early diagnosis is crucial for preventing infection. Patients recover quickly if treated on time. Both the severity of the disease and the number of deaths increase if seasonal influenza cases are not diagnosed on time, according to experts. \nNineteen-year-old Ekta suffers from excruciating pain during her periods. It is far beyond the usual pain and cannot be managed with medication–she’s tried that multiple times. Taking one dose of Meftal (a period pain medication) is never enough. The pain is debilitating most of the time.Despite several visits to gynaecologists, her complaints have been brushed aside as normal period pains. She strongly feels that her pain is abnormal, but feels powerless to address her issues.“The pain is so bad, but I cannot do anything about it,” she says. “I can’t count the number of times that I’ve been told that my debilitating pain is normal,” bemoans Ekta, whose name has been changed to protect her privacy.The normalisation of period pains means serious reproductive conditions like endometriosis often go untreated. People with endometriosis experience severe pelvic pain because tissues like that found outside the uterus grow inside it. Other symptoms of the condition include heavy bleeding during and between periods and fatigue. There is no known cure for this condition, and symptoms can start from the first period onwards.A major challenge experienced by women with endometriosis is the disregard of their symptoms by the public and medical professionals alike. Due to lack of awareness about the debilitating pain typical to endometriosis, both the person suffering from the condition, and their doctors often underestimate their severity.Severe pelvic pain is a key indicator for diagnosing endometriosis, says Dr Reena Shrestha, a gynaecologist at Madhyapur Hospital. When patients seek consultation regarding the kind of severe pain that significantly disrupts their lives, they may undergo two types of tests: transvaginal ultrasound and diagnostic laparoscopy. These procedures are used to determine the presence of endometriosis. Endometriosis is a complex condition, says Dr Hema Pradhan, a consultant gynaecologist at Everest Hospital. Amongst all the patients she meets at her consultations, many frequently turn out to have endometriosis. But, she’s noticed that often patients often delay seeking treatment because period pains are often normalised.“Women who come to me with their symptoms often delay seeking treatment, because, regardless of the severity of their pain, they believe all period pains to be normal,” says Pradhan.Eighteen-year-old Rima (name change) has been struggling with excessive pain before and during periods for years. She also experiences pain while urinating during her periods. Rima has also been diagnosed with Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome (PCOS). The co-occurence of PCOS and endometriosis is not unheard of, although research on them has been minimal.“I can barely walk when I’m on my periods, but I’ve always been told that I should just learn to live with it,” she says.Despite knowing about PCOS, she discovered the possibility of having endometriosis quite later in life. She shares this because period pain, even excessive ones, have been normalised for far too long.The general lack of awareness of endometriosis, and widespread normalisation of period pains, often results in late diagnosis and treatment of the condition.Although there may be no cure to the condition, there are ways to manage its most severe symptoms. Furthermore, receiving a diagnosis can greatly help patients to understand the severity of their condition, according to doctors. “I’m incapable of doing anything during my periods. One time I had to leave the examination in the middle of my exams because of the pain,” says Ekta. “I can’t study, can’t work, all I can do is stay in bed and cry,” she adds.Dr Pradhan reveals another challenging aspect of diagnosing endometriosis. Sometimes the condition may not appear on ultrasound scans initially. Endometrial deposits may appear differently in women due to hormonal changes. Furthermore, symptoms may vary, with some being asymptomatic altogether. According to Dr Shrestha, once a gynaecologist confirms that the patient has endometriosis, they will certainly recommend methods to manage the pain. These include analgesics for pain relief, and home remedies like hot water bag massage.However, the main problem remains. Due to lack of awareness, most patients may only find out about their condition later in life.In some cases women only discover they have endometriosis when they face infertility. Endometriosis is associated with infertility, and 30-50% of people with endometriosis may experience infertility. This also exposes another troubling aspect associated with endometriosis. Ekta shares that her relatives often express concerns about her potential infertility.“They just make me feel bad that I might never get pregnant. And it makes me feel worse,” Ekta adds.Worldwide, endometriosis has been known as a scientifically under-researched condition. It has even been called the ‘missed disease’ because of inconsistencies in its diagnosis and treatment. Endometriosis has also been widely ignored by policy makers.Treatment for endometriosis depends on the individual, says Dr Pradhan. Some are treated with hormonal medication, and others require surgical procedures. The main way to combat endometriosis is timely diagnosis, and timely treatment, she adds.“Raising awareness, timely diagnosis, and treatment are very important,” Dr Pradhan says. \nI can vividly remember my first encounter with baking when I was 10 years old. We had just moved to our new home and got a cable connection. The cable opened a world of possibilities, as it gave me access to various contents.This was back in the late 2000s when YouTube would take hours to load, taunting us with its buffering screen. I was particularly drawn to travel and lifestyle channels, mainly TLC, Fox Life, and Food Network, which kept me informed about different foods and cultures. I don’t know why, but I was always drawn to desserts. It was fascinating to see how these miraculous treats made people smile at the end of the meal.Growing up in Nepal, I noticed that baking wasn't very common. While some families did have ovens, they were mostly multifunctional ones used primarily for heating food.I also noticed that most of our desserts didn't require an oven, as they could be made on a stovetop. So, you can imagine my excitement when my mom decided to buy an oven during one of her festive shopping sprees.I could finally feel the joy these channels portrayed. (I blame food writer Nigella Lawson for getting me hooked on a domestic lifestyle.) Then, one day, after watching one of the cooking episodes on television, I finally mustered enough strength and decided to bake something. I distinctly remember wanting to make a chocolate cake for myself after watching one of Rachel Allen’s bake series. I watched all the ingredients used in that recipe and scurried across my pantry, only to realise I didn’t have half of the stuff she mentioned. I then decided to improvise the recipe (a big mistake). I randomly combined the ingredients that I had in a mixing bowl and chucked the batter into my oven, hoping for a magical cake to pop out an hour later.After I saw the result an hour later, I was mortified. The cake was stuck in the pan, refusing to come out, and it was as dense as fudge. I convinced myself that the taste was what mattered most, but when I served a slice to my brother, he made a face of utter disgust.That was the day I realised that baking soda was not the same as baking powder.After this incident, I researched baking and found out it was technical. This was a blessing in disguise for me, as I loved science, and I started to view baking as a science experiment. I then reflected and evaluated how to perfect one's baking skills.I analysed my errors and noted down all the steps I did every time I baked. Home baking is a passion for many. The idea of turning a few simple ingredients into a delicious masterpiece is as enchanting as it sounds.Yet, for many of us, this seemingly magical process can often turn into a series of unfortunate events, leading to crumbled dreams and deflated ambitions. Dense cakes, burnt crusts, rock-hard cookies and unrisen bread, if you are an amateur baker, then you have seen it all. But why do these mishaps happen so often? And most importantly how do we overcome them?From my experience, behind every successful bake lies a series of challenges and mishaps that test even the most dedicated bakers. Baking has its own set of rules that you need to follow to get that scrumptious treat every time. So, to transform a recipe into an actual dish that will impress your friends and family, I am sharing with you some of the tips and tricks I learned from my tumultuous journey as a home baker.First things first, we have to look into the prime appliance that we are working with. Commercial ovens are of two types: one that runs on gas and the other that runs on electricity. We have to look at the oven present at our home and consider its pros and cons. The main benefits of a gas oven are its size and temperature control. One can quickly change the temperature just by twisting the knob, and it preheats much more quickly than an electric one. However, they are known to have uneven temperatures at times and release more humidity, making it harder to properly crisp or brown food. This can result in burnt edges and cold or hot spots. An electric oven, on the other hand, provides more even and consistent temperatures and doesn’t release as much moisture in the air.This dry oven environment makes it easier to brown your items, making it great for baking bread. However, while the dry oven results in more even cooking, you also run the risk of drying out cakes and other baked goods.Also, many people forget to preheat the oven before baking, which is crucial for maintaining an even temperature throughout the baking process. When baking cakes and bread, I like to place a small tray of water at the bottom of the oven to provide moisture and prevent the baked goods from drying out.An oven thermometer can be a baker's best friend, providing a true reading and ensuring your creations bake evenly. I also like rotating the pan midway while baking, as it allows for an even distribution of heat.The next thing people mess up on is measuring and the specificity of ingredients in a recipe. Our moms made our food with their instinct; it is something that they learned along the way, but when you are baking, you cannot instinctively add or omit a few steps.I think that is why we initially had problems with baking. In a culture where cooking comes instinctually, baking challenges us, to be precise. A gram of more or less of any ingredient can drastically alter the outcome. Different methods of measuring flour can yield different results.Every component in baking serves a distinct purpose and function. Flour offers structure, sugar adds sweetness and moisture, eggs bind things together, and butter enhances taste and texture. However, not all ingredients are created equally. For example, using salted butter instead of unsalted might change the taste profile of your meal.Similarly, different flours have varying protein concentrations, which affect the texture of baked goods. The type of sugar used also makes a difference. Granulated sugar, brown sugar, powdered sugar, and speciality sugars like turbinado or muscovado each add unique flavours to a bake.Understanding these nuances and how they interact is critical for getting the intended outcomes. Accurate measurement tools and techniques are essential, but mastering them can be a steep learning curve. So, I would recommend investing in a kitchen scale that allows for more accurate measurements by weight rather than volume.Moving on, leavening agents such as baking soda, baking powder, and yeast are required to make baked goods rise. However, they can also cause confusion and errors. Baking soda needs an acidic component to activate, but baking powder has both an acid and a base, making it self-activating.Using the wrong type of flour or sugar, or using them in incorrect proportions, can result in flat, overly raised, or collapsed cakes. Yeast, being a living organism, presents its challenges.The water temperature must be just right—not too hot to kill the yeast, nor too cold to inhibit its activity. Proofing times and conditions also need to be carefully managed to achieve the perfect rise.Bakers should also be careful about the way they mix ingredients. The method of mixing ingredients can significantly impact the final product. Over-mixing can develop too much gluten in cakes and pastries, leading to tough textures.Under-mixing can leave pockets of unincorporated ingredients, resulting in uneven bakes. Techniques like folding, creaming, and whipping each serve specific purposes and must be executed with care.Finally, home bakers must understand the importance of timing and patience in baking. Even a minute or two can make the difference between perfectly baked cookies and burnt edges.Recipes often provide a range for baking times, but factors like oven hot spots, pan material, and altitude can affect these times. It’s crucial to keep a close eye on your bakes and rely on visual and tactile cues, such as a cake pulling away from the sides of the pan or a toothpick coming out clean, to determine doneness.Baking is also an exercise in patience, a virtue not everyone possesses. Doughs need time to rest and rise, flavours need time to meld, and baked goods need time to cool before they can be enjoyed.Impatience can lead to underbaked centres, crumbling slices, and a general sense of frustration. Cultivating patience is as important as mastering any technique in the baker’s repertoire.Home baking is a journey full of ups and downs, but it comes with great rewards. The obstacles encountered teach valuable lessons in patience, precision, and perseverance.The satisfaction of success, the freedom to create, and the therapeutic benefits make the endeavour meaningful. Whether baking for oneself, loved ones, or as an artistic outlet, the journey is as fulfilling as the result. Embrace the flour-dusted countertops, occasional setbacks, and the joys of home bakingFor a beginner-friendly recipe that involves mixing ingredients and delivers amazing results, try my recipe for fudgy, nutty brownies that I call ‘Bliss Brownies’.Bliss Brownies150g unsalted butter plus extra for the tin150g chopped dark chocolate200g caster sugar½ tsp baking powder2 eggs80g cocoa powder150g plain flour70g mixture of nuts (walnuts and almonds)60g blended papayaMix all the ingredients (except the dark chocolate and nuts) in a blender or a food processor and blitz till you get a smooth paste.Fold the chocolate and the nuts into the brownie batter, making sure that the pieces are evenly mixed in.Grease a loaf pan with soft butter and dust with cocoa powder. Pour the batter into the loaf pan.Bake in a preheated oven at 170c for 40 minutes and let it cool in the oven for an hour. Enjoy with a cup of coffee or, as I like it, a scoop of vanilla ice cream. \nIn a world where acceptance and safety often seem difficult to attain, many queer individuals also struggle to find a safe space to express themselves. They have to hide their true self and face relentless judgement when going to public places like cafes and restaurants.This is the reality for countless LGBTQIA+ individuals. The need for a safe space for this community is not just a desire but a necessity—a space where one can be themselves. This struggle for safety and acceptance can be traced to crucial historical moments, such as the Stonewall Riots of 1969 in New York City.The Stonewall Inn was more than a bar; it was a refuge for the queer community. When police raided the bar, the community fought back. This series of violent confrontations, which began in the early hours of June 28, 1969, between police and gay rights activists, marked the beginning of the modern LGBTQIA+ rights movement. The spirit of Stonewall, the fight for dignity and the right to exist openly lives on in places like Inclusive Galaxy Restaurant in Kathmandu. Inclusive Galaxy beyond a restaurant is an ‘oasis’ for the queer community and beyond.Founded by Bishwaraj Adhikari, Mr Gay Handsome Nepal 2013, a human rights defender, the restaurant proves the power of safe spaces. It’s a place where the community can unite, free from the prejudice and hostility that often permeate their everyday lives.After years of working in the human rights sector, Adhikari and his partner developed the idea for Inclusive Galaxy. What began as a small cafe gradually evolved into a full-fledged restaurant, driven by the growing demand and support from the community.“In developed countries with strong LGBTQIA+ movements, you can find community areas like gay villages. These are created as safe spaces for people whose families and communities have excluded them. They also support new business ideas and pink tourism. I hope to see pink tourism develop in Nepal someday,” says Adhikari. His vision for Inclusive Galaxy goes beyond just being a restaurant. He aims to promote financial independence and empowerment within the queer community.Since its inception in February 2019, Inclusive Galaxy has become a key spot for many in Lazimpat, a relatively queer-friendly area in Kathmandu. The location is essential because the first LGBTQIA+ movement in Nepal started in 2001 through the Blue Diamond Society.Inclusive Galaxy, true to its name, welcomes everyone—queer and non-queer alike—to share a comfortable space. His vision was clear: to create a space where people of all genders and sexual identities could come together without fear of exclusion.“I didn’t want to make it exclusively for queer people because that would be excluding ourselves from society. Different groups need to live together and understand each other,” Adhikari explains.In the early days, the cafe attracted both queer and non-queer customers. However, when some of the residents learned about Adhikari’s identity and the nature of the clientele, there was a brief period of hesitation. “At first, I didn’t understand what was happening, but then I realised my identity was an issue for a few people. I believe people should be judged by others by their character, not by their gender or sexuality. Over time, as residents saw that we operated like any other cafe, they became more comfortable,” Adhikari reflects.Adhikari started Inclusive Galaxy to give queer individuals a place to be proud of themselves, counteracting the self-doubt and insecurity that hiding one’s identity can cause. This turned the cafe very quickly into a community hub. The journey was not without challenges, though. It was difficult to hire staff and cooks from the LGBTQIA+ community, and soon after the restaurant opened, the COVID pandemic made things even harder.Despite these difficulties, the doors of Inclusive Galaxy remained open. During the pandemic, many queer individuals, who were abandoned by their families or afraid to return home, found comfort at Inclusive Galaxy.Since many couldn’t afford to pay for meals, the restaurant provided free food from its resources. As the number of people needing meals grew to 20-30 daily, Adhikari started raising funds within the community.“During my time as an activist, many people came here not only for food but also to see an organisation where the queer community supports one another,” Adhikari says.“The time during COVID was difficult, but it brought me closer to the community.”Four years after its inception, the restaurant has garnered a loyal following. Sarosy Neupane, Miss Pink Nepal 2024 first runner-up, describes Inclusive Galaxy as her second home. She moved to Kathmandu to study in 2022. Being distant from her family, she started visiting Galaxy for meals that reminded her of home-cooked food. Over time, she grew attached to the café because of its welcoming atmosphere.“It’s heartwarming to see people from our community and different walks of life here. The founders even invite us to festivals like ‘Dahi Chiura Khane din,’” she shares.Neupane visits the cafe regularly and sometimes stays until 3 am, engrossed in conversations. “I hope more spaces like this can open in the future. If, unfortunately, this place were to close someday, I don’t think we’d have any other place to turn to,” she adds.Muna Chhetri, a trans woman who has been a loyal customer for three years, shares, “This is my safe space where I can truly be myself. I always feel judged in other restaurants, but that fear doesn’t exist here. It’s where even those who aren’t accepted at home can feel accepted.”Sahara Khadka Chhetri, owner of Pink Tiffany, Kathmandu’s first openly LGBTIQIA+ friendly restaurant and bar, frequently visits after managing the bar, appreciating the convenience of not cooking at home.She notes very few places like this cater to our community, and some even had to close during COVID. “As an entrepreneur, I know that sustaining these spaces is a challenge. But as more spaces like these open, they will make the way for a more inclusive and compassionate society.”The welcoming atmosphere at Inclusive Galaxy has also had a surprising effect on non-queer patrons. Samriddha Jung Rana, a twenty-year-old neighbour who identifies as straight, often visits the café and appreciates the importance of such spaces.“Previously, I didn’t know much about the queer community and didn’t care much. But now, coming into this café, I’ve been interested in their rights and issues. I’ve realised that we’re not so different after all. We are all human,” he remarks.The ventures like Inclusive Galaxy and Pink Tiffany have inspired hope for collaborative businesses between queer and non-queer groups. The recent initiative by the Nepal Tourism Board promoting Pink Tourism in April 2024 is a positive step. Still, Adhikari believes that more support is needed from the government and the private sector.Despite the progress, challenges remain. However, Adhikari remains optimistic about the future. He is working on plans to develop the restaurant into a homestay program in the future.“Like how different planets, asteroids, and stars make up a beautiful galaxy, people from all walks of life and identities make a beautiful society. I am happy that we are assimilating together in this space. We are not so different; we are all different and similar simultaneously,” he says. \nAditya Mishra is a Nepali chef and entrepreneur based in New York. Passionate about elevating Nepali cuisine globally, Mishra sharpened his culinary skills while staging at various Michelin-starred restaurants in the city during his time at culinary school. A recipient of the James Beard Foundation National Scholars Scholarship in 2023, Mishra’s early experiences inspired him to establish his own supper club, ‘The Sewing Tin’, alongside co-founder Akhil Upad.In an interview with Post’s Aarati Ray, Mishra discusses his restaurant in New York, serving Nepali cuisines there and the recipe for his signature dish.How did your cooking journey start in New York?At 14, I told my parents I wanted to be a chef, but they preferred I pursue a stable career like engineering, as many Nepali families do. So, I left for Louisiana in 2019 to study engineering.But, cooking never left my heart so, after a year, I left engineering college and moved to New York City. It’s been three and a half years and my parents only learned about it later. When my mom visited me in NYC and saw my dedication to cooking, she saw my passion and supported my decision.What sparked your interest in cooking from a young age?As a child, I was drawn to cooking shows on TLC. The glamour of cooking, eating, travelling and the prosperity of famous chefs was fascinating.Around age 16, I discovered Chef Anthony Bourdain’s groundbreaking book, ‘Kitchen Confidential’, which shed light on the reality of the culinary industry. I learned how he became a cultural icon in NYC, reshaping perceptions of chefs.I was also fascinated by chefs like Marco Pierre White, who was a mentor to Gordon Ramsay. Their stories of achieving fame while maintaining discipline intrigued me. But, as I grew older and entered the culinary world, I realised it was far from glamorous—it involved dedication and I am glad I persevered.How did the idea for The Sewing Tin originate?The concept of ‘The Sewing Tin’ came when I realised the stark contrast between the romanticised view of kitchen work and its harsh reality. Witnessing the struggles of many kitchen staff—economic hardships, immigration challenges and language barriers—I had to rediscover my love for cooking.During my internship at ‘Junoon’ restaurant, I met my co-founder, Akhil Upad, who shared my culinary enthusiasm despite his preparations for medical college. Together, we wanted to create a dining experience that was more personal and communal, offering fine dining with a sense of community.We wanted our food to tell stories, so we named our restaurant ‘The Sewing Tin’ inspired by the immigrant experience in NYC. When immigrants opened cookie boxes as kids, they often found sewing supplies instead of food.‘The Sewing Tin’ is like opening a cookie box and finding sewing supplies—something uniquely desi, or South Asian. How do you promote Nepali cuisine in New York City through The Sewing Tin?My partner is from Atlanta with Indian roots, while I come from Nepal, so our menu celebrates and reflects both cultures and heritage.We represent our respective cultures authentically. For example, we have a dish inspired by Newari cuisine called kachaila, similar to French Tartar. We present it as Tartar to make it accessible to our customers but infuse it with Nepali flavours, telling stories about its origins and giving diners a taste of my homeland.What do you think of the prospects of Nepali cuisine abroad?I’m on a mission to share Nepali food worldwide. I have served up dishes like chatamari and lamb sekuwa in my restaurant. But I’m still learning and want to explore more of Nepal’s cuisines. My big dream? To make Nepali cuisine reach more places because it’s got something special that can wow taste buds everywhere.How do you see the changes in restaurants in Nepal?The restaurant industry has deep roots in community and bringing people together, dating back centuries. While this core idea remains, modern restaurants have evolved, making changes to adapt to the times.Yet, in Nepal, despite the growing number of restaurants, many lack uniqueness and storytelling, focusing more on making money than fostering a sense of community.I’ve noticed a troubling trend of rising prices, especially for beloved dishes like momos, which makes people question if they're getting value for their money. It seems like profits are taking precedence over creating genuine, authentic culinary experiences.The industry is starting to lose the creativity and passion that once made it special. It might be time for chefs to shake things up, challenge the norm and bring fresh ideas to the table, revitalising the culinary scene with renewed energy and creativity.What challenges have you faced in New York as an outsider?Living in a bustling city like New York as an outsider has its challenges. But, this city is also full of opportunities for those who are passionate. If you stay true to your culture and want to share your story, opportunities are waiting for you.Even though it can be daunting because of the tough competition, the city appreciates determination and expertise. When I started my journey here, all I wanted to do was cook, eat and share the story of Nepal and its diverse cultures. Instead of focusing on the difficulties, I embraced the chance to follow my passion.What do you think about the criticism of blending Nepali food with modern culinary styles?Chefs care about their food—it’s like they’re sharing a story. They’ve put in a lot of effort to become skilled, so let them be creative. It’s okay to give helpful advice but don’t be mean just to criticise. Chefs shouldn’t also just copy what’s popular, they should cook what they truly love. That’s what makes food special and meaningful.Mishra’s signature dish:Confit Duck Chatamari A traditional Nepali delicacy with French influence.Ingredients:Duck (Legs and breast)Rice (soaked overnight)MayonnaiseWhole spices (cloves, cinnamon, cardamom, bay leaf)Red onionGarlicGingerMula ko achar (Fermented radish)ScallionsLemon juiceNepali pepperVinegarSaltSugarProcedure:For the Duck:Season duck with salt and pepper.Cook in a covered pan with whole spices, garlic, and ginger at low heat for 2 hours on a stove (270 degrees in the oven)Increase heat to crisp up the skin (approximately 15 minutes).Shred the duck meat.Confit Garlic Aioli:Mash cooked garlic and ginger and mix with mayonnaise, lemon juice, Nepali pepper and fermented radishes.Pickled Onions:Slice onions and cook in a mixture of vinegar, water, salt, sugar, and whole spices until softened (about 10 minutes).For the chatamari:Blend soaked rice to make a batter, let it ferment for 6 hours, and adjust consistency with water.Assembling:Cook chatamari batter in duck fat for 4 minutes.Top with shredded duck, aioli, pickled onions and scallions.Serve \nCeleus Baral exudes a serene aura when you meet her, and when she tells you she bakes, it makes sense. Even during a brief encounter, you can tell she has the patience needed to be a baker.“You can eyeball cooking, but baking is chemistry. You have to be meticulous. You cannot rush it, or it does not turn out as expected,” says the 21-year-old environment science student. She also runs the online baking shop Bakeleus. Recently, she has also started selling her baked goods beyond her online shop, with her first stall appearing at The Yellow House’s Night Market. Bakeleus’s menu lists a variety of offerings, including jams, granola, tarts, cakes, cookies, cupcakes and brownies. Baral began baking in 2020, during the lockdown, and launched her online shop last year.She grows much of the produce she incorporates into her baking, and believes we should all understand the origins of our food. “This connection fosters gratitude and a deeper appreciation for nature,” she says. Her background in environmental science, coupled with her affinity for the natural world, imbues her creations with a unique artistic sensibility. Each item she bakes is a testament to her creativity and experimentation, as she believes consistent practice is the key to mastery.Despite the demands of being a full-time student, Baral strives to accommodate orders, typically requiring a minimum of 72 hours' notice for delivery. She is a passionate and discerning individual, evident in the love she infuses into her baking. Additionally, Baral advocates for a zero-waste policy at home, ensuring that every scrap of food and all household items are recycled.Three easy to bake recipes you can try at homeMini carrot cakes Ingredients:38 g milk or yoghurt35 g all-purpose flour1/4 tea spoon ground cinnamon1/8 tea spoon ground gingerA pinch of cardamom1 tea spoon baking powder½ tea spoon fine sea salt2 large eggs, at room temperature27 g granulated sugar13 g brown sugar (or 39 g of regular granulated sugar)1 tea spoon vanilla extract27 g extra virgin olive oil33 g carrots, peeled and shreddedChopped walnutsCandied lemon or orange slices (optional for garnish)Cream cheese frosting56.5 g unsalted butter, softened113.5 g cream cheese, softened1/2 teaspoon vanilla extractA pinch of salt250 g powdered sugarDirections:For the cake:Preheat the oven to 195°C.

The vegetable is relatively cheap and used in almost all cuisines and curries. This ubiquity could perhaps be why someone might be snubbingly called an ‘aloo’ in Nepal, but the reference does not make potatoes less important.Why have them With zero fat, potatoes contain many important nutrients—vitamins B1, B6, Vitamin C, which is an antioxidant, minerals and fibre. Along with starch, it is a good source of potassium, copper, vitamin C, manganese, phosphorus, niacin, dietary fibre and pantothenic acid. Potassium derived from potatoes is an electrolyte that benefits the heart, muscles and nervous system. Potato skin contains fibre, which is important for digestive health.Compared to other vegetables, potatoes are more energy-dense. It is free of fat, gluten, cholesterol and sodium. The relatively cheap plant-based food is also a good source of carbohydrates. Filled with nutrients, one can get a lot of them by consuming potatoes.Sourcing of potatoesPotatoes thrive in diverse climatic conditions. The country cultivates potatoes on around 200,000 hectares of land—from the plains of Tarai to the mountainous region.Every year, Nepal churns out around 3,410,000 tons of the stuff. It also imports potatoes and potato products worth Rs 8.71 billion.“These imports include potato chips, frozen potatoes and fresh potatoes,” said Biswas Poudel, a senior technical officer at the National Potato Research Programme.As its cultivation is possible in diverse landscapes, even climate change does not affect potato farming, experts say. Types of potatoesRed and white potatoes are popular and widely available in the country. Lately, dark potatoes or blue potatoes are gaining popularity.“Red potatoes are highly popular,” said Poudel. “Potatoes that come in colour contain more nutrients. Darker potatoes are packed with antioxidants.”Potatoes that taste sweet are a good source of vitamin A, an important nutrient for immunity and eye health. Purple potatoes are rich in antioxidants, including anthocyanins that may prevent heart disease and cancer and boost brain health.Other benefits As potatoes contain important nutrients, they benefit human health in multiple ways. Iron, phosphorus, calcium, magnesium, and zinc contained in potatoes help the body build and maintain its structure and strength. Consumption of the vegetable that is rich in potassium, calcium and magnesium helps reduce blood pressure naturally. Potatoes also contain a significant amount of fibre, which helps in lowering cholesterol levels in the blood and ultimately lessens the risk of heart disease. Fibre also boosts digestive health.Compared to other green vegetables, farmers use only a minimal amount of pesticides in potatoes, making them safe to eat. Chips and french friesOf late potato chips and french fries are gaining popularity in Nepal. They are also popular dishes in most restaurants and people have even started making french fries at home. Children love potato chips the most. Intake of nutrients and micronutrients, fibre and antioxidants components depends on how potatoes were cooked or prepared for food.Consumption of a lot of chips and french fries can lead to added calories and unhealthy weight gain.“Fibre and antioxidant and other micronutrients of the potatoes may be lost while frying,” said Poudel. “As potatoes are a carbohydrate-rich vegetable, it is not necessary to consume them with rice, which many people do in Nepal.”Experts say diabetic people should limit their potato intake as they cause spikes in blood sugar. \n“How much oxygen do you have for the summit?”I think this is the kind of question a film producer would ask. But when you're on the mountain, the answer is never clear.I have worked for a long time in the film industry and different art areas, especially photography and engraving.Working in various fields and drawing inspiration from them has become a new normal for me. I have made this approach my way of life without even realising it.I took responsibility for producing the last movie I worked on and shot the behind-the-scenes footage for a documentary. By doing so, I witnessed the entire shooting process and the journey of a movie.In the snowy highlands of Turkey, we had to endure the consequences of the changing climate to shoot ‘About Dry Grasses’, directed by Nuri Bilge Ceylan. The highlands used to be snowy in January, but by the time we got there in the same month, there was no snow. Nature was changing. It was responding to what was happening—to what humanity had done to it. In the end, it snowed, and we shot the intense snow scenes we wanted. But since most of our days were sunny, unlike what the director wanted, we had to shoot in the sunset and sunrise hours. As crew members, we spent many days waiting for the sun to set.Production requires creating opportunities, finding solutions, and being creative for a work of art to come true. For this, patience, endurance, calmness, and timing are necessary. On the other hand, nature wanted us to listen to it and wait for the right time.During that time, I witnessed many of nature's lessons. For example, I experienced extreme cold for the first time. We endured temperatures ranging from -33 degrees to +55 degrees. By listening to nature, surrendering to its forces, and working within its limits, we managed to persevere.No matter how much you prepare or plan during the pre-production phase, if you are working in nature, remember that nature will always have the final say.The film was completed, released, and connected with audiences. Its success at Cannes 2023 was followed by my trip to the North Pole for my project. I returned with a mix of wonderful developments, joys, and challenges. During this process, I experienced life and death, happiness and sadness, losses and awards.I realised the value of being able to breathe comfortably a few days after my father's chemotherapy ended. Just a few days earlier, he had said, \"Well done, my daughter. I'm glad you went!\" All the anxiety and hard work, filled with fears at the beginning, were finally behind me.Before going to Everest, when I was on the verge of giving up, defeated by my fears, I remembered my father's words. Everest reminded me of what he said while struggling to breathe, adding a turning point to my life.What does it mean to say ‘life’s turning point?’ How many turning points can there be in life?Who am I, and what am I doing in this world? How well do I know my own limits? Can I find answers to these big questions? These thoughts sparked my dream of journeying to Everest. Now, after returning, I can say that it turned my life around.“How much oxygen do you need for the summit?” sounds more like “How much do you need to hold on to life?” How many reasons do you find that give meaning to your life, keep you alive, and allow you to breathe? How much can you endure in the face of obstacles, and can you keep believing that a solution will eventually come your way?Can these questions be separated from the idea of measuring and assessing something, from learning its quantity and financial value? Can everything be known with certainty? Should the journey be fully understood in advance, with all its promises laid out? Should it be viewed like a purchase with a price tag, asking, “Is this journey worth this much?”I had never trekked before and had no climbing experience. I had lived at sea level my entire life and had never been to a high altitude.However, this journey was not only about the physical climb but also an inner discovery. After losing my father to lung cancer, his breathing difficulties taught me the fragility of breath, life, and existence. I also mentally prepared myself for the physical challenges I might face. Despite all my concerns, could this journey help me understand the cycle of life and the resilience of the soul?So, how could I make this trek possible? How could I land in Nepal? Despite all the economic difficulties and the many things I felt needed organising, I did my best and believed in it.Since I was embarking on this journey, I felt I should share about my travels and inspire others.Starting with photography, cinema, and engraving, which are already integral parts of my life, I dreamed of documenting and sharing the inspiring aspects of this journey.After months of correspondence and dreaming, it all came true. Finally, I embarked on the journey with the goal of creating photographs, engravings, and documentaries. I learned a great deal from my travels in Nepal, from the people I met, and from every moments I witnessed. I felt incredibly fortunate to have been able to honour my father’s memory with the peace and serenity I experienced in the Himalayas.During my 15-day journey to Everest Base Camp, I encountered nature’s masterpieces at every turn. As concerns like “How will I endure?” and “How will I finish?” started to weigh on me, the mountains suddenly parted with the clouds and gazed down at me.It was amazing to witness the appearance of ‘Gods’ that I had never seen before, in such immense size and in such a close, awe-inspiring manner beside me during that silent walk.As someone who came from one of the most crowded cities in the world, Istanbul, while I struggled with my daily questions and uncertainties, trying to control everything, they stood there calmly, as if answering me.They were just there—before and after.My guide, Lakhpa Sherpa, always reminded me not to worry about how high we were, how long it would take to reach our accommodation, or what the weather would be like. He encouraged me to live in the moment, and he was right.He advised me to focus on my breathing, not to get thirsty, to eat enough, and to appreciate the extraordinary beauty of the journey. In the mountains, plans dissolve and each moment is embraced as it comes.All the good wishes, prayers, and everything encountered along the way were for the journey itself. The mountain was full of life, secrets, and everything I had wondered about.This 15-day journey to Everest Base Camp was a solo adventure, yet I wouldn't have been able to complete it without my guide, Lhakpa, and my porter. Additionally, I was fortunate enough to experience the hospitality, generosity, and honesty at Trekkers Paradise, which organised the entire journey and provided guidance.I witnessed how dedication and sincerity are crucial in completing a journey safely and healthily. Ghanshyam Sharma, from Trekkers Paradise and Sauraj Jhingan, a climber who summited the Everest in 2018, shared their experiences with me during the journey.They experienced the 2015 earthquake while they were at the Everest Base Camp.As a filmmaker, their role as actors, and attention to detail played a significant role in bringing my dream photography and documentary project to life.The sponsors of my journey were Turkish Airlines, The North Face, Apple, Canon, and Stanley. My supporters include Oscar International College and Nepal Film Campus. Throughout the journey, I shared many experiences, memories, and countless photos and images with my students.On my way back home after 21 days, I celebrated my birthday on the plane. From the right window, the Himalayas bid me farewell. I felt like I had opened a new chapter in my life, and I was certain that I would return.I had made many friends and memories in Nepal.For now, I will be working on a documentary and preparing for a photography and engraving exhibition titled ‘My Soul Beyond the Mountain’.To the Himalayas: This summer was spent with you, but we will meet again soon. \nWe spent five days in Sri Lanka two weeks ago, driving up and down the island, covering almost 70 percent of its territory. Our tour spanned over 1,000 kilometres, including hills, beach spots, and heritage and religious sites.Our first stop in Sri Lanka was Colombo’s Bandaranaike International Airport. We were greeted by a warm and humid breeze when we exited the airport. The host briefed us (a group of journalists) that heavy rainfall has affected areas across Sri Lanka since mid-May 2024. Rain and storms intensified on June 1, with the most significant effects in the south and west of the country. We were lucky to have no rain in the forecast.On the first night, we checked into the lavish Jetwing Lake resort, an opulent sanctuary amidst the lush landscape. The resort’s expansive grounds were a retreat, offering a glimpse of Sri Lanka's natural beauty. We feasted on delicious cuisine, every bite exploding with flavour, introducing us to the island’s famed culinary delights. On June 7, early morning, the sun shone brightly, previewing the promise of an incredible journey ahead. We set off early the following day, eager to explore the mysteries of this enchanting island. As we ventured further into the heart of Sri Lanka, the landscape revealed its majestic nature. We were astounded by seeing Pidurangala Rock, a 200-metre-high granite colossus just a kilometre north of Sigiriya. The short hike to Pidurangala Rock offered breathtaking views of Sigiriya and beyond. We climbed the steep steps and soon were rewarded with a breathtaking panoramic view of the surrounding landscape. It took us 30 minutes to climb. The sight took our breaths away and left us humbled in the presence of such grandeur. From the top are glorious vistas of the surrounding landscape and an incredible view of the majestic Sigiriya Rock. From there, Sigiriya Lion’s Rock is visible, standing alone. This was the place where demon king Ravana had his palace in the Treta Yuga. Believed to have been built 50 centuries ago, the palace is said to have had a unique lift for Ravana and his visitors. Ravana imprisoned Sita in one of the caves at the bottom of this humongous boulder. Sigiriya is a fifth-century fortress in Sri Lanka carved out of an inselberg, a hill of hard volcanic rock that soared high above the surrounding jungle. We spent two hours atop the rock, mainly taking photographs. We descended from Pidurangala Rock, filled with awe and a sense of accomplishment.The journey ahead seemed even more enticing as we ventured along the winding roads, heading towards our next destination.Cash-strapped Sri Lanka plunged into its worst financial crisis in more than seven decades in 2022, with a severe dollar shortage sending inflation soaring to a high of 70 percent, its currency to record lows, and its economy contracting 7.3 percent.Thanks to the growing number of tourists, Sri Lanka is now bouncing back.In Jetwing Lake, we met Kasun Pradeep Somasiri, a receptionist. He briefed us that the resort is now 50 percent occupied. “That’s a better figure now as we are recovering.”The travel and tourism sector is a significant income generator for Sri Lanka. However, the economic crisis, the Ukraine–Russia war, and China’s zero-Covid policy have jeopardised the industry.Tourism accounted for more than 12 percent of the country’s GDP in 2019 and was the third-largest source of foreign exchange reserves, behind worker remittances and the apparel industry.Sri Lanka was poised to be one of the world’s best holiday destinations due to its rich culture, wealth of natural resources, and diversity of accessible experiences.However, tourism-dependent Sri Lanka suffered its first major setback with the Easter bombings 2019. This led to the collapse of inbound tourism flows as international arrivals declined by 18 percent year-on-year, and tourist expenditure fell by 17.7 percent that year. This was immediately followed by two years of pandemic restrictions. Inbound visitors fell to just 116,600 in 2021.An acute balance of payments crisis forced Sri Lanka to preemptively default on foreign debt of over $50 billion in April 2022, triggering a crippling economic contraction with spiralling inflation.“Tourism is gaining momentum,” says Somasiri. “The British and Chinese have started to return to Sri Lanka.”January-August is the peak season for foreigners. “From December to April, local people travel for holiday purposes,” says Somasiri. Before we started the tour to other religious sites, our tour guide, Sampath Mayadunne, told us, “Don't take selfies with your back to Buddha.” Turning your back on a Buddha statue and some other religious sites to take photos and videos is a strict no-no.The most common sight across Sri Lanka is the tank cascades system, an ancient irrigation infrastructure. The system is a network of small tanks draining to large reservoirs that store rainwater and surface runoff for later use.“These infrastructures were built by its ancient kings over 2,000 years ago to solve the water scarcity in the country’s dry zone,” says Mayadunne.On day two, we travelled to Ranweli Spice Garden in Matale. This garden is famous for its rare spices and herbs. A tour of the gardens will show you the cultivation, harvesting, cleaning, and packaging process, as well as the health benefits and uses of the herbs.On the way, we saw a colourful Muthumariamman Hindu temple, boasting hundreds of detailed sculptures in a rich mosaic of colour.In Kandy, we visited the Temple of the Tooth Relic (Sri Dalada Maligawa), one of the most sacred places of worship in the Buddhist world. It was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1988.The temple sustained damage from bombings by Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna in 1989 and by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam in 1998. However, it was fully restored each time.We then headed to Jetwing St Andrew’s, a luxurious 5-star property in Sri Lanka’s hill country of Nuwara Eliya, situated at 1,900 metres above sea level. During our stay in Kandy, we immersed ourselves in the city's charm and the serenity of the countryside. On the third day, early morning, we travelled to Nuwara Eliya, the area famous for tea estates that give many Nepalis the feeling that they have come to Kanyam, Ilam, in eastern Nepal.We visited a tea factory called Damro Labookellie Tea Centre, the oldest tea centre in Sri Lanka. Due to its cold climate, it is the most important area for tea production in Sri Lanka.In this tea factory, they make white and black tea, while the green tea is processed in another tea factory and then sent to Damro.After the tea factory tour and the tea tasting, we headed to Galle, our next resting point.We encountered narrow, winding, and maze-like streets and alleys in Nuwara Eliya, known as ‘Little England’. The town has preserved almost all its British-era buildings and is calm and beautiful. On our way to Galle, at the roadside, our tour guide stopped us at the famed Sita temple, which has Hanuman's footprints and is the place where Sita, wife of Lord Rama, was held captive by the demon king Ravana after he abducted her from India.We were at Sita Eliya, a temple named Sri Seethai Amman.When we reached the Hindu temple, rich in vibrant colours and architectural elements, it was full of devotees. The water stream adjoining the temple is believed to be where Sita bathed. Large footprints are found on the stones in the stream, and there is a saying that those belong to Hanuman, who came spying to find Sita’s whereabouts.In Ella, Ravana’s waterfalls are significant in the Rama-Ravana story. The cascade charms visitors from all over the globe. The waterfall is easily accessible and is known to have hidden caves at the top, which are believed to have been used as Ravana's residence.The 25-metre-tall waterfall is a beautiful cascade that provides the perfect backdrop for a photo to remember your Ramayana trail adventures in Sri Lanka. A short pilgrimage tour ended there, and it was now time for an adventure. Though it was not part of our itinerary, our guide decided to tour us on a train ride.Though short, only six kilometres from Ella to Demodera, it was thrilling. Everyone screamed in unison like kids on a fair ride to hear the echoes in the dark every time we passed through the tunnels. The sound of the train is subtly different inside a tunnel. For the first-timer, the darkness and shouts inside the tunnels when the train passes would be scary, like a horror movie.The train we boarded wasn’t crowded, but people had already filled the doorway, ready for the scenic journey.With the shrill sound of a whistle, the train slowly pulled away from the platform at Ella, passing houses, coconut trees and green fields.As the train progressed, tourists and locals were leaning out the windows and crowding to hang out the doors. I joined the crowd and hung out on a train. A short excitement ended there.After lunch, we headed to Galle and reached Jetwing Lighthouse. As soon as our group entered the hotel, they shouted with excitement.The hotel is on a rocky outcrop three miles west of Galle. Waves crash over giant boulders in front of it and produce howling winds.We were at Galle’s 17th-century fort five minutes from the hotel on day four. In the Bay of Galle on the southwest coast of Sri Lanka, Galle Fort was built first in 1588 by the Portuguese and lavishly rebuilt by the Dutch during the 17th century. It is a historical, archaeological and architectural heritage monument that maintains a perfect appearance even after more than 436 years.We then reached Hikkaduwa Beach, a popular beach destination on the southern coast of Sri Lanka. On the way, we saw a 30-metre-high Big Buddha Statue. It is a replica of the 6th-century Buddhas of Bamiyan destroyed by the Taliban in Afghanistan. It was created using the earliest known sketches of the statue. It was built in remembrance of the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami victims.We then travelled through the 222-kilometre-long Southern Expressway, Sri Lanka's first expressway linking the capital, Colombo, with Galle, Matara, and Hambantota, significant cities south of the island.On day five, we reached Colombo, the capital of Sri Lanka. Jetwing Colombo Seven hosted us in the bustling capital. We took a city tour early morning and visited Bally's Casino at night.On day six, we returned to Kathmandu early in the morning on a Sri Lankan Airlines flight, the airline that organised the trip in coordination with Jetwing Hotels Limited, a Sri Lankan hotel chain.National flag carrier Nepal Airlines, in its previous avatar as Royal Nepal Airlines, used to operate direct flights to Colombo during the 1980s. However, the carrier suspended operations following an armed movement by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) in Sri Lanka. There had been no direct air links between the two countries for decades.In 2016, Himalaya Airlines started a chartered flight that lasted a few months due to low traffic movement between the two countries. Sri Lankan Airlines started operating direct flights to Kathmandu in August 2021.“The main objective of this media tour is to increase tourism in both countries for mutual benefit. We want to draw Nepalis for pilgrims and leisure activities,” says Nilina Pathirana, Country Manager at Srilankan Airlines in Nepal.“We have understood that Nepali travellers tend to travel to Bangkok, Vietnam, Malaysia, Dubai, and Maldives. Nepalis have quite minimal knowledge about Sri Lanka and the religious connection between Lanka and Nepal. We want to promote Nepal and Sri Lanka jointly. This will be a win-win business,” added Pathirana.The airline said it currently carries 60 percent of the passengers from Nepal to Sri Lanka and beyond destinations like Tokyo, Sydney, Melbourne, and other Middle Eastern destinations. The return airfare for a 3.5-hour-long flight starts at Rs74,000. “We have a four-night, five-day package that begins from Rs80,000, depending on the properties and extended itineraries,” says Pathirana.Nepalis must submit certain required documents for visa processing, like their passport copy and bank statement. Due to this government-to-government policy, only Nepalis must obtain a prior visa. Otherwise, Sri Lankans are required to have a visa upon arrival.“The other best thing is that Sri Lankan Airlines can be involved with the visa process or facilitate the Nepalis tourists. Our main intention is to have a sustainable market in Kathmandu and make it a daily flight,” says Pathirana. \nMundhum Trek in Koshi province in the eastern part of Nepal is a new cultural walking trail. It passes through several indigenous ethnic villages and landscapes in Khotang and Bhojpur districts. This trail goes up to an elevation of 4,200 metres to the viewpoint of Silchung Peak and takes one through the settlements of the Kirati people. This route starts from Diktel Bazaar and passes through beautiful settlements like Chakhewa, Rawa Dhap, Salpa Bhanjyang, Silchung and Hanspokhari before ending in Bhojpur. There are some hotels in Diktel but trekkers are advised to carry tents. The trail offers panoramic views of most of the eight-thousanders, including Everest, Lhotse, Makalu, Cho Oyu and Kanchenjunga mountains. The spring season, March through May, is highly recommended for the trek.Janaki Mandir Janaki Mandir at Janakpur in Madhesh province was constructed in 1874 and is a blend of Mughal and local architecture. The temple is a three-storey building and has 60 rooms, making it the largest temple in Nepal. Pilgrims flock here by the thousands to pay homage to Janaki Mandir—Janaki being the other name of Sita, the daughter of King Janak. The temple houses an idol of Sita which was found near Ayodhya, the kingdom of Ram. The marriage anniversary of Lord Ram and Sita is celebrated in Janakpur every year on Vivaha Panchami, which falls in December. In the southwest corner of Janaki Mandir is the Vivaha Mandap, which has been built at the site where the marriage of Ram and Sita is said to have taken place. Another well-known temple in the vicinity is Ram Mandir, which is built in pagoda style and is hence different from the other temples in Janakpur that generally bear resemblance to Mughal architecture. It houses a female statue, said to be of Yogamaya, which has the reputation of being one of the most beautiful images of female forms in Nepal. Other holy sites of interest include the Laxman Temple, Sankat Mochan Temple and Hanuman Temple.Kuri Village, Kalinchok Kuri village, a popular tourist destination around 150 km from Kathmandu, lies at an altitude of 3,842 metres above sea level in Kalinchowk of Dolakha district, in Bagmati province. People visit the place to enjoy the snow during the winter besides the mesmerising landscapes and splendid panoramic view of the Himalayan range. Kalinchok gets snow mainly at the end of December and the snowfall continues till the end of February or mid-March. When there is snow, it is difficult for jeeps, buses and cars to reach the top of Kuri village. Chains are wrapped around the wheels of vehicles and specially modified jeeps with highly experienced drivers are used to carry visitors. There are several hotels and restaurants in the area. The road up to Kuri has also improved over the years.Annapurna Base Camp Annapurna Base Camp trek, in Gandaki province, makes for a picturesque journey that takes you to the foothills of the Annapurna South, up to 4,130 metres above sea level. The five-day trek (seven days for slow walkers) offers rich cultural diversities, typical Nepali villages and the flora and fauna nestled at the foothills of Annapurna. The distance from Pokhara to Annapurna Base Camp is approximately 81 kilometres. It is among the shortest and most budget-friendly treks in Nepal. For Nepalis, lodging costs around $5 to $10 per day. For foreigners, the overall cost of the trek ranges from $800 to $1500 on average per person. Annapurna Base Camp trek can be done at any time throughout the year as each season offers a different trekking experience. The ideal time for the trek depends on your weather preferences and what you expect from it. However, autumn (September to October) and spring (March to May) are considered the two best seasons for the trek, as the days at the time are warm and bright with clear skies.Bardiya National Park Bardiya National Park, located in the southern Tarai belt of Lumbini province, is home to one of the most elusive and majestic animals on earth—the Royal Bengal Tiger. The park, which covers an area of 968 square kilometres, is considered one of the most important protected areas in the country. It is a prime destination for those looking to catch a glimpse of a tiger. A bit of luck and patience will offer a good chance to see the Bengal Tiger. The jungle safari also offers one the opportunity to spot Asian elephants and the greater one-horned rhinoceros. The rare Gangetic river dolphins are occasionally spotted on rafting trips along the Geruwa River, the eastern channel of the Karnali river. Besides, visitors can enjoy the homestays and explore local Tharu culture. The right time to visit the park is from mid-September to mid-December and mid-February to May.Khaptad National Park Khaptad National Park in Sudurpaschim province is a protected area in the far western region. It stretches over four districts of Bajhang, Bajura, Achham and Doti and ranges in elevation from 1,400 to 3,300 metres. The park can be visited throughout the year. Trekkers are advised to bring their tents, food and other supplies. The Nepal Tourism Board says of late, social media has been increasingly influencing Nepali travellers to go to Khaptad. Since the far-flung Khaptad National Park is still offbeat for many travellers, the area remains pristine and fresh. The seasons of spring (March-May) and autumn (October-November) are the ideal times to visit the park. The temperature ranges from 10°c to 20°c offering pleasant trekking weather. The monsoon begins in June and lasts until September and during this time, roads often become muddy and slippery. From December to February, winter brings snow and chilling winds to the park.Limi Valley \nOnce again, my heart swelled with joy when my hometown came into view.Arriving at Lalikharka after the treacherous journey through Pauwa Bhanjyang and the bustling Kanchhi Dokan, Phidim, the headquarters of Panchthar district, revealed itself like a surprise gift. My home town, Phidim, is unique in the fact that it reveals to travellers approaching it from uphill. As the vehicle descends the mountain road, it slowly comes into view, its houses and buildings recognisable for the native son.This Dashain, I undertook the much-awaited trip to my hometown with my wife Kabita and daughter Aarohi. Little did I anticipate the transformation that awaited me.The moment I got out of the jeep, I noticed that Phidim, nestled in the lush hills, has undergone a remarkable transformation over the years. As I guided my family to my home, which had suffered damages in the 1989 quake that struck eastern Nepal, I found that old, mud and stone houses had been replaced by concrete buildings. The place was vastly different from the one I remembered.Arriving at my childhood home felt like reuniting with an old friend. Navigating its nooks and crannies with my daughter, we delved into the history of the house, a symbol of my cherished memories.My wife had visited Phidim years ago, spending a month with my parents. She, too, recalled beautiful moments she had had in the town. I asked the tenant about the neighbours and acquaintances. Some had died, while others had left for good.A call to local journalist Giriraj Banskota led me to the school grounds, where memories flooded back. This was where I spent my teenage years, playing ball, learning to kick, and watching major tournaments. Here, I even encountered a group of Western climbers headed to Kanchenjunga, the world’s third-highest mountain. I remember being awed by their shiny yellow tents, headlights and strange smell. I remember practising my tutephuteko Angrezi with the climbers. Birendra Shield, an annual sports tournament named after the late king, brought ace players from various schools in Panchthar district. The district also hosted Yuba Mela, an annual three-day fair to commemorate the birthday of the king, organising football tournaments in which teams from as far as Sunsari and Taplejung participated. I never excelled at dribbling balls. A boy growing up in a seven-member family, I soon found my interest in literature. In the late 1980s, Phidim hosted a major literary festival. In the run-up to the 1990 pro-democracy protest, walls were painted with anti-monarchy slogans, local politicians were arrested. I took my family to my school, Naya Namuna Secondary School. It was Saturday, so the school was closed. I peeked through the steel gate and wall, imagining myself labouring over classes. Memories are hazy, but what I remember most is going out of the school—to quiz contests with me leading the school team, to essay competitions at the District Education Office and to play carom board, a national pastime, in a nearby shopfront. Returning to the main street, the demolition of a landmark gate made me reflect on how cities transform, shedding old landmarks for new identities. Navigating narrow alleyways, I felt like a stranger in my own hometown. Multistory buildings have emerged and roads have been paved, reshaping the town. It’s the same place with a different face, leaving me nostalgic for the Phidim of my memories.We finally reached Shivalaya temple, which I told my wife and daughter was one of my cherished hangouts. A giant statue of Falgunanda (the Kirant leader’s birthday is celebrated on November 10) stood before the steps to the temple. Though my wife suspected I came here to smoke, in reality, I visited the temple in the evening to meet friends and talk about issues that mattered most to us at the time. It also offered a panoramic view of the town (I could not take my family to Gadhi Danda, a hillock across the Shivalaya).Towards the end of my journey, I felt sad about Phidim’s lack of prospects. To my dismay, I found that people have been leaving the town in droves. Despite blacktopped roads and multi-story buildings, Phidim faces a troubling reality. The lack of quality higher education and specialist healthcare has driven people away, echoing the circumstances that led me to Kathmandu years ago. Conversations with locals confirmed a mass exodus from the town, a trend that raises concerns about Phidim's future.My conversations with familiar strangers led me to conclude that Phidim has transformed into a transit town for pilgrims heading to Pathibhara Devi Temple, which is around 255 kilometres north in Taplejung district. I met dozens of people headed to the holy site. While pilgrims see it as a stopover, for me, it was a homecoming. The realisation dawned that Phidim is, perhaps, in a state of transition, trading its rustic charm for the hallmarks of urbanisation. While I left Phidim for higher education in Kathmandu, people from rural areas have flocked to the town in search of better opportunities, bringing life and energy to the once quiet community.As we bid adieu to my hometown, I couldn’t help but reflect on the inevitability of leaving a place, no matter how enamoured one is with it. Passing Kanchhi Dokan, I pointed out Kanchnajungha and Kumbhakarna to my daughter—symbols of my childhood. Phidim, now a blend of nostalgia and change, remains etched in my heart, a testament to the intricate dance between memory and evolution. \nThe gate leading inside the city of Lucknow proudly declares, “Muskuraiye aap Lucknow mein hain” (Smile because you are in Lucknow). During my brief stay, the city lived upto its promise. Known as the city of Nawabs, with a rich history going centuries back, the city is abuzz with autos, rickshaws, honks of public buses and the constant loud sounds of the metro going over your head, irritable honks of public buses and food that leaves you wanting more.In such a happening place stands Bara Imambara, built in 1784 by Asaf-ud-Daula. ‘Bara’ means big, and ‘Imambara’ is a building with a big hall where people assemble for mourning congregations. This building was originally built to provide employment for the public because, at that period, the country was going through a famine, and it was seen as a relief project. I walked through the grand entrance gate known as Rumi Darwaza (Turkish Gate), wiping my sweat and fighting the Lucknow heat, entering the vast complex. Echoing in all corners was a voice from the speaker that kept reminding the visitors of the many rules inside the historical place. I tried not to let the wonder overwhelm me as I walked through the complex. To my right stood the elegant Asafi Mosque, recently painted in cream-like white. Its design is visually pleasing and a testament to the Mughal era’s artistic finesse. Its walls are adorned with intricate calligraphy and elegant designs, reminiscent of a time when such aesthetics held great importance. I couldn’t help but admire the tremendous effort the craftsmen put into bringing the Nawab’s vision to life, meticulously crafting the elegant domes which seemed to touch the sky. The mosque’s serene atmosphere stands in stark contrast to the bustling city just beyond its walls.Upon stepping into the main hall—known as Asafi Hall—I was immediately struck by its sheer size. It is vast and impressive, appearing to stretch into eternity, and its massive arched roof seemed to defy gravity. What’s even more intriguing is that it stands without the support of pillars or beams. The interlocking system of bricks, a hidden secret, upholds this colossal structure, leaving one in awe of the brilliance of the builders of the past.This very hall houses a large vaulted central chamber with the tomb of Asaf-ud-Daula. Standing beside his tomb was a chilling moment, knowing that the remains of a great historical figure was resting just a few feet below. After scanning the large hall, the guide took me to my favourite part of the Imambara—the labyrinth or the Bhool Bhulaiyaa. This labyrinth sits right above the main hall, and because the hall is unsupported, the ceiling had to be lightweight, so the hollow labyrinth was born. It is quite impossible to figure out the Bhool Bhulaiyaa on your own, as it is a confusing network of corridors and staircases. So, it is necessary to have the company and guidance of a guide.As I moved with my guide through the maze, I thought I could feel the presence of the past inhabitants who had walked through these confusing passageways. What fascinated me most was the maze’s design: every sound, no matter how faint, echoed through the structure, enhancing its aura of mystery.The guide whispered from a distance, his head close to the wall, and the sound reached my ears, even though he was out of sight. It felt as if the walls carried the whispers. We exchanged astonished glances. When the guide reappeared, he smiled and remarked, “Now, you understand why they say that walls have ears.”Exiting the maze, I climbed to the roof, which offered a breathtaking view of Lucknow. The city spread out in front of me, its modern skyline contrasting the monument’s historic charm. It was a moment of reflection, contemplating how centuries had passed, and yet, Bara Imambara stood as a timeless witness to the changing tides of history. As I stood there, taking it all in, I felt recharged by the air coming in from all directions. After descending from the terrace, my brisk guide led me to the final stop in the Imambara, Shahi Baoli (Stepwell). Also referred to as the royal stepwell, it sits underground and is another example of architectural brilliance in the complex. This didn’t surprise me much since it was built at a time when architecture wasn’t just functional but also a work of art.The moment I descended the steps that led me underground, I noticed the sudden drop in temperature. The Shahi Baoli served as a cool refuge during the blistering summer day. The well-planned architecture of the Baoli allowed it to naturally regulate its temperature. The way to the main well is locked, but visitors can throw coins through jail-like doors into the well in order to try out their luck, much like we do in Davis Falls in Pokhara.Entering the underground corridors, I felt a slight chill because it was cold and dimly lit. I turned on my phone’s flashlight and saw the walls adorned with intricate Mughal carvings. Upon reaching a spot where we could see the well, the guide informed us that the well acted as a CCTV camera at the time. He explained that individuals inside the structure could discreetly observe those entering, as their reflections would be visible on the well’s water, but the people entering could not see the people inside the building.I waited to see that happen, and when a group entered through the gate, I was stunned; their faces were perfectly mirrored on the water’s surface, showcasing the ingenuity behind the well’s design, serving both as a water source and a security measure.My experience at Bara Imambara was a delightful one. I had never seen such a remarkable work of architecture before—it is beautiful, interesting and ahead of its time. \nPanama beat Bolivia 3-1 on Monday to finish second in Group C and qualify for the Copa America quarter-finals after tournament hosts the United States were eliminated following a 1-0 loss to group winners Uruguay.The win moved Panama, playing in only their second Copa America, up to second on six points, three more than the US, as the central American side reached the knockout stage for the first time.Uruguay finished with nine points.Jose Fajardo opened the scoring for Panama while substitutes Eduardo Guerrero and Cesar Yanis scored late to seal all three points, with Bolivia’s lone goal coming from Bruno Miranda.Bolivia needed a win with only a slim chance of staying alive in the tournament, but it was Panama who broke the deadlock in the 22nd minute when Cristian Martinez set up Fajardo.The 30-year-old forward expertly controlled Martinez’s header into the box, let it bounce and volleyed the ball past Bolivia goalkeeper Guillermo Viscarra.Bolivia equalised in the 69th minute when they cut through Panama’s midfield and defence, with Ramiro Vaca finding Miranda, who slipped his shot past the keeper.Bolivia nearly took the lead in the 78th minute when Panama goalkeeper Orlando Mosquera ventured out of the box but Miguel Terceros’s long-range effort was thwarted by the retreating Panama defence.A minute later, Panama wrested back control of qualification when Davis curled in a cross from the left and Guerrero connected with a glancing header - his first goal for his country.Yanis made sure of victory in the first minute of added time, blasting a right-footed shot into the top right corner after he was put through on goal, sparking wild celebrations at the Inter&Co Stadium.While Panama wait to learn their quarter-final opponents with Group D set to finish their games on Tuesday, Bolivia exit the tournament after three straight losses having conceded 10 goals and scoring just one. \nGoalkeeper Diogo Costa saved all three penalties as Portugal won 3-0 in a shootout against a brave Slovenia side who had held them to a 0-0 draw after Cristiano Ronaldo’s extra-time miss from the spot in a dramatic Euro 2024 last-16 clash on Monday.Portugal had the lion’s share of the chances but also their brilliant goalkeeper to thank for a one-on-one save from Slovenia striker Benjamin Sesko as they stumbled into a quarter-final meeting with France in Hamburg on Friday.Costa also saved from Josip Ilicic, Jure Balkovec and Benjamin Verbic in the shootout - the first keeper to save three penalties in a Euros shootout - to send his side through despite a team performance that lacked spark for the most part.“This is probably the best game of my life,” Costa said. “I focused on doing what I had to do. I went with my gut feeling. Of course we had analysed the penalty takers, but players change how they shoot. I'm very happy and very excited to have helped the team.”Ronaldo in particular will come under the spotlight as he wasted several opportunities to go with a penalty miss in extra-time that left him in a flood of tears and needing to be consoled by team mates.Portugal were awarded the penalty late in the first half of extra time when Diogo Jota’s storming run into the box was illegally stopped by defender Vanja Drkusic, who had already been booked and was lucky not to receive a second yellow card.They have a reliable penalty taker in their team in Bruno Fernandes but captain Ronaldo elected to take it and his effort was superbly saved to his left by Slovenia’s Jan Oblak, who pushed the ball onto the post.“Even the strongest people have their (bad) days. I was at rock bottom ... when the team needed me the most,” Ronaldo said in a post-match interview before bursting into tears again.“Sadness at the start is joy at the end. That’s what football is. Moments, inexplicable moments,” he said. \nAn 85th-minute deflected shot by Randal Kolo Muani, listed as a Jan Vertonghen own goal, gave France a nervy 1-0 win over a disappointing Belgium on Monday and sent them into the quarter-finals despite another poor show by their misfiring forwards.France made most of the running in a cagey game but were reckless with their finishing, until a nice combination of passes, finished off by N’Golo Kante, finally created space for substitute Kolo Muani to turn and bundle a mishit shot in off the leg of Vertonghen and leave goalkeeper Koen Casteels wrong-footed.France will now meet the winner of Monday’s match Portugal in the quarter-finals in Hamburg on Friday.It was a fittingly scruffy decider for an underwhelming game and means that France still have yet to score in open play at the tournament, recording two own goals and a Kylian Mbappe penalty across their four games.Various combinations have been tried up front, while midfielders and defenders also caught the bug on Monday with some wild attempts, but coach Didier Deschamps, unsurprisingly, preferred to focus on the positives.Belgium clearly had a plan to take any speed out of the game, playing at less than walking pace at times, with Kevin de Bruyne often operating just in front of his back four.The only decent chance of the first half came for France after 34 minutes when Jules Kounde whipped in a curling cross that recalled striker Marcus Thuram headed wide.Aurelien Tchouameni forced Koen Casteels into his first save of the day soon after the break, while ever-lively Mbappe miskicked a decent chance as France began to put some passes together.A rare Belgian thrust was cut short by a brilliant Theo Hernandez tackle just as Yannick Carrasco was about to pull the trigger and Romelu Lukaku and De Bruyne then brought good saves from Mike Maignan.France were in the ascendancy but the poor finishing that has dogged their campaign continued with William Saliba and Mbappe both blazing wildly over before Kolo Muani's decisive intervention.It was a meeting between officially the second (France) and third (Belgium) best teams in the world, but after both edged into the knockout stage managing only two goals apiece from their three games, both looked extremely cautious in attack for most of it.For Belgium, another dispiritingly tame exit adds to their appalling record in the European championship since losing in the final in \nAustralia said on Monday it had more than doubled the visa fee for international students, the latest move by the government to rein in record migration that has intensified pressure on an already tight housing market.From July 1, the international student visa fee has risen to A$1,600 ($1,068) from A$710, while visitor visa holders and students with temporary graduate visas are banned from applying onshore for a student visa.“The changes coming into force today will help restore integrity to our international education system, and create a migration system which is fairer, smaller and better able to deliver for Australia,” Home Affairs Minister Clare O’Neil said in a statement.Official data released in March showed net immigration rose 60% to a record 548,800 people in the year to Sept. 30, 2023.The rise in fees makes applying for a student visa for Australia far more expensive than in competing countries like the U.S. and Canada, where they cost about $185 and C$150 ($110) respectively.The government said it was also closing loopholes in visa rules that allowed foreign students to continuously extend their stay in Australia, after the number of students on a second or subsequent student visa spiked by over 30% to more than 150,000 in 2022–23.The latest move follows a raft of actions since late last year to tighten the student visa rules as the lifting of COVID-19 curbs in 2022 boosted annual migration to record levels.English language requirements were tightened in March, while the amount of savings international students need to get a visa was raised in May to A$29,710 ($19,823) from A$24,505, the second increase in about seven months.Universities Australia CEO Luke Sheehy said the government’s continued policy pressure on the sector would put the country's position of strength at risk.“This is not good for our economy or our universities, both of which rely heavily on international student fees,” Sheehy said in an emailed response.International education is one of Australia’s largest export industries and was worth A$36.4 billion to the economy in the 2022-2023 financial year. \nPresident Joe Biden’s train-wreck debate with Republican opponent Donald Trump followed a series of decisions by his most senior advisers that critics now point to as wrong-headed, interviews with Democratic allies, donors and former and current aides show.Trump, 78, repeated a series of well-worn, glaring falsehoods during the 90-minute debate on Thursday, including claims that he actually won the 2020 election.Biden, 81, failed to refute them and his fumbling, halting performance has sparked calls from Democrats for him to end his quest for a second term and for “soul-searching” or resignations among top aides.“My only request was make sure he’s rested before the debate, but he was exhausted. He was unwell,” said one person who said they appealed to Biden’s top aides in the days before, to no avail. “What a bad decision to send him out looking sick and exhausted.”Others were even more pointed.“It is my belief that he was over-coached, over-practiced. And I believe [senior aide] Anita Dunn... put him in a venue that was conducive for Trump and not for him,” said John Morgan, a Florida-based attorney and major Biden fundraiser.Morgan said Dunn and her husband, Bob Bauer, the president’s attorney who played Trump in pre-debate rehearsals, should “be fired forever and never let back anywhere near the campaign.”Biden’s debate strategy was signed off on by campaign chair Jen O’Malley Dillon, who helped him win in 2020 and was appointed in January to boost an uneven reelection campaign. Dunn, a longtime Biden aide and former Barack Obama campaign strategist, backed that strategy.Confidence going into the event was high. Trump was convicted of falsifying documents by a jury in New York on May 31, while Biden held back-to-back visits in Europe.To the surprise of some Biden aides, his stubbornly low poll numbers began to inch up nationally in the weeks that followed.Advisers set up a rigorous debate prep calendar, with Biden sequestered at Camp David for six days.An inner circle, some close to Biden for decades, were involved: Ron Klain, his first White House chief of staff, Dunn, former White House counsel and long-time adviser Mike Donilon, as well as about a dozen other policy and political experts.Biden’s campaign said on Friday that no staff shake-up was under consideration. Multiple aides, not just Dunn and Bauer, were involved in the preparation, said a campaign official, who also noted that Morgan was not there.In an email to supporters Saturday, O’Malley Dillon said internal polls and focus groups showed no change in voters’ opinions in battleground states after the debate. She warned “overblown media narratives” may drive “temporary dips in the polls,” but said she was confident Biden would win in November. \nFrench voters headed to the polls on Sunday in the first round of a snap parliamentary election that could usher in the country’s first far-right government since World War Two, a potential sea change at the heart of the European Union.President Emmanuel Macron stunned the country when he called the vote after his centrist alliance was crushed in European elections this month by Marine Le Pen’s National Rally (RN). Her eurosceptic, anti-immigrant party was a longtime pariah but is now closer to power than it has ever been.Polls opened at 0600 GMT and will close at 1600 GMT in small towns and cities, with an 1800 GMT finish in the bigger cities, when the first exit polls for the night and seat projections for the decisive second round a week later are expected.However the electoral system can make it hard to estimate the precise distribution of seats in the 577-seat National Assembly, and the final outcome will not be known until the end of voting on July 7.“We are going to win an absolute majority,” Le Pen said in a newspaper interview on Wednesday, predicting that her protégé, 28-year-old Jordan Bardella, would be prime minister. Her party has a high-spending economic programme and seeks to reduce immigration.A woman screamed “It’s shameful, it’s shameful” as Bardella arrived to cast his vote in Garches near Paris. “They even invited the leftists,” he said.If the RN does win an absolute majority, French diplomacy could be headed for an unprecedented period of turbulence: with Macron - who has said he will continue his presidency until the end of his term in 2027 - and Bardella jostling for the right to speak for France.France has had three periods of “cohabitation” - when the president and government are from opposite political camps - in its post-war history, but none with such radically divergent world views competing at the top of the state.Bardella has already indicated he would challenge Macron on global issues. France could lurch from being a pillar of the EU to a thorn in its side, demanding a rebate of the French contribution to the EU budget, clashing with Brussels over European Commission jobs and reversing Macron’s calls for greater EU unity and assertiveness on defence.A clear RN victory would also bring uncertainty as to where France stands on the Russia-Ukraine war. Le Pen has a history of pro-Russian sentiment and while the party now says it would help Ukraine defend itself against Russian invaders, it has also set out red lines, such as refusing to provide long-range missiles.In Hénin-Beaumont, a town in Le Pen’s constituency in northern France where she may be re-elected in the first round, 67-year-old Denis Ledieu said people were suffering due to the long-term deindustrializaton of the region.“So if the (RN) promises them things, then why not? They want to try it out, I think,” he said.Across France, early turnout figures were higher than in the 2022 legislative vote, at 25.9% by midday, compared with 18.43% two years ago, the interior ministry said.‘Split vote favours RN’Opinion polls have suggested the RN has a comfortable lead of 33%-36% of the popular vote, with a hastily assembled left-wing coalition, the New Popular Front, in second place on 28%-31% and Macron’s centrist alliance in third on 20%-23%.The New Popular Front includes a wide range of parties, from the moderate centre-left to the hard-left, eurosceptic, anti-NATO party France Unbowed, led by one of Macron’s most vitriolic opponents, Jean-Luc Melenchon.How the poll numbers will translate into seats in the National Assembly is hard to predict because of how the election works, said Vincent Martigny, professor of political science at the University of Nice and the Ecole Polytechnique.Candidates can be elected in the first round if they win an absolute majority of votes in their constituency, but that is rare. Most constituencies will need a second round involving all candidates who received votes from at least 12.5% of registered voters in the first round. The top scorer wins.“If you have a very high level of participation you might have a third or fourth party that is getting into the struggle. So then of course there’s a risk of split voting and we know that the split vote favours the National Rally,” Martigny said.For decades, as the far right steadily gained popularity, voters and parties who did not support it would unite against it whenever it edged closer to national power, but that may not hold true this time.Martigny said no one knew whether candidates from Macron’s camp would consider dropping out of the second round to give rivals from the left a chance of beating the RN, or the reverse.Le Pen and Bardella have sought to make their party’s image more acceptable to the mainstream, for example by denouncing antisemitism. Le Pen’s father Jean-Marie Le Pen, founder and long-term leader of the RN’s forerunner, had a history of overtly antisemitic comments.But critics say the RN’s courting of Jews is just a cover allowing it to deny accusations of racism while constantly stigmatising Muslims and foreigners. \nA Russian missile strike hit a nine-storey residential building in the central Ukrainian city of Dnipro on Friday, killing at least one person and injuring 12 others, officials said.Interior Minister Ihor Klymenko warned the death toll would likely rise as more people remained trapped in the building where four upper storeys collapsed as a result of the attack.Later statements from the Interior Ministry said the fire at the site had been extinguished, the remains of one person had been detected underneath the rubble and two people were listed as missing.Regional governor Serhiy Lysak said 12 people had been injured, including a 7-month-old infant. Three people were in severe condition.A photograph published by Lysak on the Telegram messaging app and other images circulated on social media showed a badly damaged building that had smoke rising from a gaping hole in its upper storeys.President Volodymyr Zelenskiy called on Ukraine’s allies to step up supplies of air defences to help the military intercept Russia’s regular aerial attacks.Dnipro, which had a pre-war population of almost one million people, is a major Ukrainian city that lies on the road to the east of the country where the most intense fighting with Russian forces is raging.It has been regularly targeted by missile and drone strikes since Russia launched its February 2022 invasion. Russia denies targeting civilians and civilian infrastructure, but thousands of people have been killed. \nNepal’s book market is no stranger to the popular Bangladeshi-Swedish writer Taslima Nasrin. Almost all of her books have been translated into Nepali, but Nasrin herself says that they are all unauthorised translations. “All books [Nepali translations] are pirated versions,” Nasrin told the Post in a Whatsapp conversation. Nasrin, who is currently in exile in India after facing death threats in Bangladesh following the publication of her novel Lajja (Shame), said that she or her publishers have never allowed anyone the right to translate her books into Nepali. “I don’t know of any such Nepali publishers. No one asked for permission and no one has paid [me] royalty.”Translating and publishing books without permission from authors or publishers is a punishable crime. But Nepal’s book market is full of such unauthorised translations and prints of books written by the who’s who of the world literature. Such endeavours haven’t just hurt the authors but also the readers, says Ajit Baral, publisher of the Kathmandu-based Fineprint publication. “These translations are poor,” Baral says. “Tomes with 1200–1300 pages have been trimmed to 200–300 pages. An example is the biography of Bill Clinton.”Another popular book that has seen unauthorised Nepali translation is the biography of Steve Jobs by Walter Isaacson.“We have no official deal in place for a [Nepali] translation of Steve Jobs,” Peppa Mignone, associate agent of the CAA, the translation authority of the biography, said in an email interview with the Post.The book’s Nepali translation is published by Panchpokhari Publication House. The translated book identifies the translator thus: “Achyut Koirala, who has a master’s in English literature, is primarily a journalist. He is currently affiliated with Nagarik daily. He keeps a close tab on international history, politics and culture and has written scripts and dialogues for half a dozen Nepali films. He has published over a dozen non-fiction books.”Koirala, who admits to the unauthorised translation, claims that he hasn’t just translated the book but has also done ‘creative writing’ with it.‘Rich Dad Poor Dad’, written by Robert Kiyosaki and Sharon Lechter, is among the books that’s perennially on the bestseller list across the world. Upon investigation, the Post found three Nepali translations of the book—all unauthorised. One of them is translated by Dilip Kumar Shrestha and published by the same firm, the Panchpokhari Publication House. Another Nepali iteration of the book is published by Book For All publication and translated by Kopila MD. Yet another Nepali version is translated by one Sudheer Dixit and published by Plata Publication, Kathmandu.In an email conversation with the Post, Ronson Taylor, who oversees the international rights at The Rich Dad Company, said, “At this point in time, we do not have a relationship with an established publisher in the [Nepali] language market. If there are any Rich Dad Poor Dad books currently for sale in the Nepali market, they are pirated.”Basanta Thapa, a writer and translator, says that many books are being translated of late to make easy money. “But how would the quality of these unauthorised translations be!” Thapa wonders. “Readers who haven’t read the original wouldn’t know the faults in the translated versions.” Thapa says that any translator worth his salt aims to ‘recreate’ a book and it takes much work to do that.Taslima’s books are the major victimsTaslima’s memoir Uttal Hawa has been translated into Nepali as ‘Sangharsha’, literally Struggle, and is published by Khoji Publication House. Even though the book in its cover claims that it is an authorised translation from the English version Wild Wind, it is a pirated one. The book is translated by Bikash Basnet and edited by Bhogiraj Chamling. A revised version of the book is edited by Sangeet Srota (Yam Bahadur Chhetri).The same publication house has also published the Nepali translation of the book’s sequel as ‘Prem ra Jeevan’. Publisher Sushil Chalise says that while he is aware that one needs to receive permission from the author or the publisher to translate a book, his efforts to contact Taslima were unsuccessful. Therefore, he had published the version the translator made available to him. Translator Basnet, too, admits he translated the book without Taslima’s permission. “About a decade back, we didn’t know how to ask for permission,” he said.Nepal has the Copyright Act (2002) in place. Before it, there was the The Patent, Design and Trade Mark Act, 2022 (1965) that included intellectual property in its 2006 revision. Even the Muluki Ain (Civil Code) of 1910 BS had a provision about copyright. Moreover, it goes without saying that translating somebody else’s work without permission is immoral.Likewise, Indigo Ink Pvt Ltd has published a Nepali translation of Taslima’s anthology of essays No Country for Women as ‘Aaimai ko Kunai Desh Chhaina’. The book is translated by Krishna Giri and edited by Pramod Pradhan. “I have no idea about the agreement between the publisher and translator,” Pradhan, who is also a children’s book writer, says. “I just copy-edited it upon request.”Bishnukumar Poudel, publisher of Indigo Ink, however, claims that he is still trying to take translation rights for the book. “We translated the book long ago,” he says. “We are still trying to get translation rights.”Indigo is also publishing unauthorised translations under its imprints All Book Store Pvt Ltd, Book for All and Plata Publication. It has published two versions of Rich Dad Poor Dad under those shadow imprints. But Plata Publication is not registered in the Company Registrar’s Office.Pradhan says that many foreign books have had unauthorised translations in Nepali and their quality is poor. Those books are translated not from the original language but from a second or third language, so these translations are bound to have problems, he says. “After I learned that those were unauthorised translations, I have stopped editing them,” Pradhan said.Indian author Shiv Khera’s You Can Win has been translated into Nepali by Bloomsbury India and has granted the distribution rights to Ekta Books. But the book’s unauthorised translations are also found in the market and they don’t even mention the name of the publisher and translator. What is interesting is they mention that it’d be illegal to republish the book, or an excerpt of it, without the author’s permission.The Nepali translation of the book, which was poorly written and rife with inaccuracies, had landed the publisher at court. After a complaint was filed at the District Court Kathmandu in 2066BS on the charge that the publisher violated the copyrights and economic rights, the court had issued a verdict on Mangsir 11 that year, charging a fine of Rs10,000, Rs20,000 and Rs30,000 to the defendants Netra Prasad Pokharel, Narayan Prasad Bhusal, and Bhagwati Risal and Bishnu Silwal, respectively.Baral, the Fineprint publisher, says that international publishers wouldn’t demand much for translation rights given Nepal’s small market, but Nepali publishers do not bother to reach out to them. “Publishers who put out unauthorised translations and sell them at 50 percent discount have troubled publishers like us,” he said.Fineprint has published authorised translated versions of books such as Leaving Microsoft to Change the World by John Wood, Healed by Manisha Koirala, and Hippie by Paulo Coelho. The publication house is also set to release the Nepali translation of Israeli historian Yuval Noah Harari’s bestseller Sapiens. Translated into Nepali by Dinesh Kafle, the book’s translation right was acquired at the cost of USD1300, Baral said. Likewise, the publication acquired the translation rights of Sadhguru’s Inner Engineering at IRS93,000, he added.Baral says that publication of unauthorised translations is an immoral and illegal work. “This phenomenon not just hampers Nepal’s fledgling book publishing industry but also tarnishes the country’s reputation in the global market,” Baral said.Thapa, the writer and translator, points out the lack of regulatory mechanisms in the country. “We don’t have an agency that regulates the quality of translations being done,” he says. “Nobody compares the translation with the original. We need a dedicated authority to enhance the quality of translation.” Universities, Nepal Academy and other stakeholders can play a role to uplift the translation sector, he adds.One’s pain, another’s pleasureWhen the author Suketu Mehta was travelling through Mumbai, a young man approached him with a handful of books while his vehicle was stuck in traffic. Brandishing Maximum City, written by none other than Mehta himself, the young man requested the author to buy a copy. Suketu leafed through the book and said, “This is a pirated copy and I’m the author of this book.” The youth wasn’t bothered and replied, “Okay, you can buy it at a discount.”This anecdote was shared to the Post by Mehta’s friend, the author and professor Amitava Kumar, in an email exchange.Most of these pirated books are imported into Nepal from India while the retailers of original books are finding themselves increasingly in trouble. “We sell original copies but many readers doubt us as well, given the ubiquity of pirated versions,” says Anjan Shrestha, operator of Education Book House, Jamal.Ramchandra Timothy, chair of Thapathali-based Ekta Books Pvt Ltd, said that the phenomenon of piracy has tarnished Nepal’s image internationally. “There was a time when Bangladesh would be known as ‘piracy king’,” he said. “Now there's a risk Nepal would take the crown.”As tax increases, so does piracyThe government decision to impose a 10 percent tax on book imports in fiscal year 2019-20 led to a proliferation of pirated book markets, booksellers say. After the decision, booksellers started to cut back on imports and that led to the entry of a new crop of pirated booksellers, a trader in Kathmandu says. But following widespread backlash, then finance minister Bishnu Paudel struck down the policy.“After the government’s decision, we stopped importing books for a while,” says Shrestha of Education Books. “The import of books went down for about two years. Then the pirates stepped in to fill the gap. It was about that time that pirated copies of biographies and memoirs of Obamas and Jai Shettys became omnipresent in the market.”Pirated copies of classics by Roald Dahl and JK Rowling also made an entry in the Nepali market. Then the phenomenon only saw a rise.Since the customs department does not levy duty on foreign books and also does not care to differentiate between the pirated and original copies, unauthorised books have found a safe haven in Nepali market.The government doesn’t levy any customs duty on books and newspapers published by foreign publishers abroad. The importers should only pay Rs565 at the customs points. But Nepali publishers have to pay 10 percent tax to import books printed in India.James Taylor, director of Communications and Freedom to Publish of the International Publishers Association, says that the government, publishers, writers and readers should join hands to control widespread piracy. “The government should realise that book publishing and reading culture contribute to the country’s economy as well,” he said, adding that the government should seize pirated books and close websites that sell pirated ebooks.Nandan Jha, executive vice chair of Penguin Random House India’s sales, production and business department, says that piracy has emerged as a big challenge for publishers of late and has harmed the authors, publishers, distributors, printers, readers and other stakeholders. “To confront piracy, all the stakeholders should launch a special joint effort,” Jha told the Post in an email exchange.Piracy has proliferated in the Nepali market to such an extent that the publishers of such books and unauthorised translations keep whatever ISBN numbers they like, often conflicting with other books, and still get off scot free. If scanned or searched on the internet, the ISBN number gives details on the author of the book, what the book is about, and its price, among others.Bijay Sharma, information officer at TU Library, says, “Keeping ISBN number at one’s will is illegal. If anyone files a complaint, we can punish them.”By the lawThe Muluki Ain-1910 BS had mandated that a publisher take permission of Gorkha Bhasa Prakashini Samiti before publishing any material. The Copyrights Act came into effect in 2022 BS and was amended in 2054 BS. In 2059 BS, a new Act was promulgated and it is still effective now. Authorities are currently working to amend the Act to give the registrar’s office more autonomy regarding copyright.According to the 2059 BS Act, copyright violations are considered government cases. In such cases, plaintiffs should file a complaint with the police. The Act’s clause 25 has various conditions that amount to violation of copyright. The Act’s subclause A says that if a publisher produces or copies material in writing or sound and sells or distributes it, it amounts to violation of copyright.Likewise, the Act’s clause 26 prevents selling of unauthorised material. The clause restricts the ‘importation of copies of work or sound recording, either made in a foreign country or sourced otherwise, into Nepal for business purpose shall not be permitted if preparation of such copies would be considered illegal if they were prepared in Nepal.’If anyone infringes upon protected rights, they are liable to punishment but the provision’s implementation remains lax.The law gives the authority to district court to take legal action against copyright violators.Advocate Parshuram Koirala says that if the government becomes more proactive, it can punish violators on the basis of the 2059 BS Act and thereby control the phenomenon of intellectual theft and copyright violations. “Creation is a crucial part of humanity’s benefit,” he says. “If intellectual property is not protected effectively, then there’d be no inspiration to create something.”Bal Bahadur Mukhiya, a professor at Nepal Law Campus, suggests the inclusion of rules about digital piracy in law, and also the clauses of various related international treaties and agreements that Nepal is part of.“In the US, a teacher or professor should pay a certain revenue even to photocopy a chapter of some text for teaching purposes,” Mukhiya says. “But in Nepal, those who photocopy an entire book and sell it go scot free.”(This report is prepared in collaboration with the Centre for Investigative Journalism, Nepal.) \nBharat Budha, chair of Putha Uttarganga Rural Municipality’s ward 10, knows that many youths from his village have made it to the United States via ‘tallo bato’—backdoor route—and that many are still on the way. He also knows that eight of them have been deported from the country and that they have lost a cumulative Rs45 million in the process. The deported youths say that they returned home empty-handed after facing unspeakable ordeals and lost Rs6 million each on average.The Tak village in Rukum East—a close-knit settlement of 425 houses—was considered the Maoists’ ‘base area’ during the insurgency. Village youths who reached the US through illegal routes and got deported have lost an estimated Rs40 million. The number of those who returned without completing the journey and the amount they lost remain unknown.To get to the US, the youths have taken loans at up to 36 percent interest per annum from their relatives and village landowners. In Tak village, at least one person each from half of the households has gone abroad, Budha said. “Youths started going to America about six-seven years ago,” he said. “If they could gather enough money, the whole village would try to go to the US.” Budha’s own son had reached the US illegally in 2017, spending Rs3.2 million.During the insurgency, outsize slogans of revolution would adorn the walls of houses in the village. Hoping for a better life, people from all walks of life helped out the Maoists. But now, village youths are paying the agents to illegally get to the US—a country that the Maoists used to call their ‘enemy’, an ‘imperialistic force’. This has cost the Tak village much and in multiple ways.Death of a dreamSome of the deported youths have chosen to flee the village altogether, burdened with debt and creditors’ pressure. At least five such families have already left, said a resident. The family of Ram Budha was one of them. On April 28, 2015, Ram, who had returned to Nepal after working in Malaysia for eight years, took the illegal route to the US. He travelled through arduous trails for months and finally arrived in the country. Upon reaching the country, he was detained and had to stay at the detention camp for 27 months. When his refugee application was rejected, he was deported to Nepal in mid-December 2019. He lost Rs4.5 million in the process. He now owes over Rs6 million to creditors. “After the creditors began to put pressure on me, I couldn’t live in the village peacefully,” said Ram, who currently runs a vegetable farm in Tarakeshwar, Kathmandu.While those who got to the US through illegal routes and fortunately got refugee status there narrate their stories with pride, those who have been deported or returned from half-way have tragic tales to tell.Nanda Kala Gharti, who lives in a small stone house on the upper flank of Tak village, spends her days in melancholy. Her husband, Dhanlal, had chosen to take the illegal route to the US, and Nanda Kala, a mother of four, is living with the repercussions of his decision. Dhanlal had got into the US after a six-month long arduous journey and was detained immediately. He had to spend four years in the detention camp, before he was deported to Nepal. He had already lost Rs6 million.Nanda Kala said they now have an insurmountable crisis in their hands. Pointing to her son, she exclaimed, “When will he grow up, go abroad and pay back the loans!”Dhanlal himself tried to go to Croatia once and spent 15 days in Kathmandu for the process. But after he was turned down, he returned home dejected. “Now we will submit the passport to another agent [for Dhanlal’s trip abroad],” Nanda Kala said. “There’s no point staying here.”Stories that echo each otherThe situation in Sisne Rural Municipality is similar to that of Putha Uttarganga. Here, one can hear plenty of stories of those who have tried to go to the US and those who are fighting refugee cases there. Krishna Regmi, chair of the rural municipality, personally knows seven people who have been deported from the US.Gangaram Khadka, a resident of Sisne-3, runs a bee and chicken farm. Like other young men in his village, Khadka had headed off to the US via an illegal route on 27 March, 2018. He had reached the US via the New Delhi-Moscow-Barcelona-Bogota-Panama-Costa Rica-Nicaragua-Honduras-Guatemala-Mexico route. When he finally arrived in the US, he was detained and had to spend 11 months in detention. He was deported on 15 March, 2019. He had handed over Rs3.2 millions to the agent and spent Rs2 million to fight the case to become a refugee. “It’s not possible for me to pay back the loan while working in Nepal,” he said. “I aim to pay back some interest and head off abroad again.”For six months after Khadka was deported, he had anxiety and headache, he said, adding the three people from his village who were deported like him are also struggling with their mental health.Tikaram Pun, a 40-year-old resident of Bohora village in Musikot-4, is also haunted by his past journey. In September 2017, he reached the US after crossing 17 countries with the help of organised human traffickers. Of the 41 people in his group, 31 were from Rukum East and Rukum West, he said. Pun, who was detained on arrival in the US, spent 24 months in a detention camp. His refugee application was also refused and so he was deported along with eight other Nepalis. “When I returned, I started having mental health problems. I still suffer from them,” he said. Pun is under pressure from creditors and relatives to pay back the Rs9.2 million loan he had taken for the task.Those who died on the wayA group of 10 Bangladeshis and seven Nepalis, including Rupak Bohora of Bafikot-3 in Rukum West, were on a mission to reach Costa Rica through Colombia, Caribbean Coast, Capuragana and Panama. But while they were crossing a sea, their boat capsized. As many as 12 died in the incident, including six Nepalis. Rupak’s wife, Geeta, learned about the incident only after six days, on 25 June, 2021.“I still don’t know what exactly happened,” said Geeta, who had been married off at age 19 and is now a mother of two daughters. The only thing she knows is that Rupak has died and she is now all alone. And that she has Rs5 million in loan taken for Rupak’s trip. She showed a picture of her husband on her phone to this scribe and said, “I only have memories.”Lack of political will and legal remediesThe concrete bridge over Chewang river is on the edge of Tak village. On the walls of the bridge are paintings of political theorists like Marx, Engels, Lenin, Stalin and Mao, and the iconic slogan, ‘Workers of the world, unite!’, below them. But the slogan appears to be at odds with life in the village. Given the phenomenon of illegal travels to the US through the help of organised human traffickers, the whole village appears to be emptying. Neither the local governments are concerned about the phenomenon nor are the political parties paying attention.Puniraj Gharti, chair of Putha Uttarganga Rural Municipality, said though the trend is worrying, there’s nothing he can do. “How could we stop them from making the trip when they are struggling to make a living in the village?” he said.Krishna Regmi, chair of Sisne Rural Municipality, said that the vicious cycle of poverty started after marijuana farming was banned in the country. Then the Maoist insurgency added to the woe, forcing youths to migrate. The signing of the peace agreement in 2006 didn’t herald any change in the economy either and youths are struggling to get jobs. Organised human traffickers are cashing in on this sorry state of affairs, Regmi said. “Meter byajis [usurious lenders] are also promoting this phenomenon,” he added.The phenomenon is equally rife in Dang’s Tulsipur and Ghorahi. Ramesh Kumar Pandey, chair of Ghorai-15, says that even though many heading to the US are swindled, no complaints are filed at the ward office. “Only those who attempt to go to Saudi Arabia or Qatar file the complaints,” he said.One can infer from Pandey’s statements that the families of such illegal travellers don’t want to publicise the ordeals of their family members. On the one hand, agents threaten them to not publicise the issue; on the other, they fear they themselves would be punished by law.According to the Anti-Human Trafficking Bureau, as many as 178 Nepalis, including 174 men, have been deported from the US in the five fiscal years after 2018-19. Of them, the highest 49 are from Rukum while 37 are from Dang. The data doesn’t include those who returned after making it to the half-way or those who have been fighting the legal battle in the US for refugee status. But this data is enough to show that many such youths are from the ‘base areas’ of the Maoist insurgency.SSP Jeevan Shrestha, chief of the bureau, said that data on the number of such victims and the amounts they have spent is hard to collect since complaints are rarely filed with the police. “This is human trafficking but for a lack of law, we are still compelled to launch the cases as per Human Trafficking and Transportation (Control) Act 2074 BS,” Shrestha said. “The Act provides a maximum penalty of Rs250,000 for the offenders and 50 percent of that as compensation to the victims.” Without specific law, police also invoke the theft and organised crime act to punish the offenders, he added.On the one hand, police receive no complaints; on the other, the phenomenon sees no control.Bhaskar Gautam, a political scientist, says the rise in cases of human trafficking in the insurgency’s ‘base areas’ is due to the political system’s abject failure.While the Maoists raised issues related to livelihood, nationalism and a new kind of democracy to fuel their war machine, after the peace process, it is livelihoods that have been hit the hardest, Gautam said. “The traditional way of life and economy took a hit during the insurgency,” he said. “Developments after the peace process also failed to address that. What sprang up was organised human trafficking.”(Mahesh KC in Rukum East and Durgalal KC in Dang contributed to this report.)This report is prepared in collaboration with the Center for Investigative Journalism-Nepal. \nGyanumaya BK had been suffering from severe backaches for a while. The resident of Pokhara-15, BK visited the Metrocity Hospital in Srijanachowk seeking treatment five months ago. The 69-year-old, who works as a labourer, has already spent over Rs50,000 on follow-up checkups and medications.BK spent eight days in the hospital in January and has been paying off loans she had taken to pay her bills and for follow-up visits to the hospital. Had BK been aware of the Health Facility Operation Standards-2020, which private hospitals must adhere to, she wouldn’t have had to borrow money to pay her medical bills. As per the regulations, hospitals must set aside 10 percent of their total beds to the underprivileged and needy.“I didn’t know hospitals were required to provide free treatment to those who can’t afford hospital stays,” BK said. “But even if I did, I would have to fight to get the service as the hospital won’t willingly offer me the service.”The Pokhara-based 50-bed hospital’s Chief Executive Officer Gyan Prasad Aryal admits that his hospital does not adhere to the mandate. “We don’t have explicit information from the health ministry on the Health Facility Operation Standards-2020,” said Aryal. “Moving forward, we will follow the instructions.” The hospital authorities say they give a 10-15 percent discount on the final hospital bill as opposed to dedicating 10 percent of their beds and free treatment and medications to the less privileged. Hospitals with 15 beds come under the jurisdiction of the local units while those with up to 50 beds fall under the ambit of the Provincial Health Directorate. Likewise, the Provincial Health Ministry oversees health facilities with over 50 beds.However, no regulatory body has data on whether health facilities are following government rules, especially Health Facility Operation Standards-2020. But it is an open secret that most private hospitals in Pokhara are not following the regulations.Pokhara Municipality Health Department Officer Yadunath Baral, Kaski District Health Officer Bhim Prasad Poudel, and Province Health Director Khim Bahadur Khadka all admit that local hospitals disregard the regulations. “Our monitoring and inspection is also lax, that’s why most hospitals ignore the rules,” he said. He says lack of manpower hampers effective inspection. “Our manpower is enough to conduct inspections in other districts, but not in Kaski, which has many private hospitals,” he said. “We need more people for that”. According to Baral, although the hospitals claim to offer a certain discount on final bills to the needy, they are unable to show the record of the discounts provided. “The hospitals claim they give discounts, but most hospitals have not even been able to show us the proof,” said Khadka. “Legal actions should be taken against the hospitals that fail to submit a monthly report on the free services for the poor. More importantly, they must be liable for flouting government standards that aim to benefit the poor.” The Provincial Health Directorate also does not have any data on the directive’s implementation at hospitals with more than 50 beds.The department’s chief of health services Dr Ramesh KC says that they have been working on updating information of health services in the Gandaki region. “Hospitals have failed to submit their mandatory monthly reports. We will seek that information when they come for new permits or permit renewal,” KC said. There are 27 privately-owned hospitals within the Pokhara Metropolitan City and 39 in the Gandaki region. Bharatpur Metropolitan City in Chitwan in Bagmati Province is also called the ‘medical city’  as it is home to 23 private hospitals with a total of 1,200 beds. Additionally, there are multiple large-scale government hospitals and two medical colleges—Chitwan Medical College and College of Medical Sciences—that also provide medical services. Had the Health Facility Operation Standards-2020 been followed by the 23 private hospitals, 120 patients would have received free health services every year, according to Durgadutta Chapagain, chief of the Chitwan Health Office.“Although the hospitals claim they provide the services, none have been able to provide convincing proof. Instead, we found them giving such discounts to patients who are close to hospital operators,” said Chapagain. “Our department validates the permits for new health facilities and re-registrations for hospitals with a 25-bed capacity. We have asked such public health service providers to put up posters or stickers reading ‘Discounts for the needy’ on the hospital premises so that patients know what services they can get on discount.”Meanwhile, Bikram Adhikari, Secretary of the Private Hospitals Coordination Committee in Chitwan, claims that the regulations are impractical. “There are a few services that hospitals can provide free of cost. You cannot expect hospitals to provide all services for free. That’s why there is a need to amend the existing regulations,” said Adhikari.The monitoring bodies’ inaction and lackadaisical approach to ensuring that public health services are accessible and affordable to all makes private hospitals blatantly ignore government mandates.Bharatpur Metropolitan City’s Deputy Mayor Chitrasen Adhikari says that although the metropolis is aware that private hospitals must allocate 10 percent of their beds for free treatment of poor people, the metropolis administration has yet to devise a monitoring mechanism. “We have not taken any steps towards that end, but we will soon,” he said.Just like Pokhara and Chitwan, Biratnagar is also plagued with the same problem. There are 32 private hospitals currently in operation in the metropolis. Deepak Bhattarai, statistical officer at the municipality’s health office, asserts that none of the health facilities met the set requirements. A monthly report submitted by the Biratnagar-based Nobel Medical College and Teaching Hospital, which has 750 beds, stated that the hospital had provided the said concession to more than 400 patients. “However, the report did not clarify how many of the 400 patients were provided free hospital beds and the services that come along with the beds, and how many were given discounts on their hospital bills,” Bhattarai said. “We found that hospital reports also include concessions provided to patients who sought outpatient, emergency, and X-ray services.”The hospital’s director Narayan Dahal claims to be following all government instructions. He says 10 percent hospital beds are set aside for needy patients who are not charged any treatment fees, while 10 percent of service seekers also get discounts.Although the Biratnagar Metropolis has directed all health facilities under its jurisdiction to allocate free beds and provide free services to the needy, inform service seekers about the government-provided services, and submit a list of all patients who have received the services, the directive is ignored more often than followed. According to Bhattarai, medical establishments must get a letter from the local unit before making any upgrades or purchasing any equipment. “But the hospitals have been found presenting fake documents in order to acquire such permits,” he said. “The metropolis has refused such permits to 12 private hospitals in the current fiscal year.”Butwal Sub-Metropolitan City in the Lumbini Province has also taken no concrete step to ensure private hospitals adhere to Health Facility Operation Standards-2020. Despite having the authority to carry out inspections, the sub-metropolis’ apathy has deprived hundreds of needy patients of various government services. The sub-metropolis with 17 wards has more than two dozen big hospitals in the Butwal bazaar area itself. Not one of them adheres to the government’s health regulations. But the sub-metropolis is yet to monitor these hospitals. Yubraj Pandey, chief of Butwal Sub Metropolitan’s health department, says they have been unable to inspect medical institutes due to a lack of a proper set of rules.“I have just been transferred here. Discussions are underway to prepare legal requirements,” he said. Private hospitals in Butwal only began filing their reports two months ago after a joint meeting, informs Chief of the Sub Metropolitan’s Education and Health Department Mitramani Khanal. Twenty-year-old Suraj BK of Sarawal Rural Municipality-2 in West Nawalparasi got into a motorcycle accident on April 26. He suffered injuries on both his legs and was taken to Zenus Hospital and Research Centre in Butwal. Suraj was handed a bill of Rs 70,000 for treatment but he did not have the money to clear the bill and sought the hospital’s help. “The hospital refused to provide any discount. They in fact refused to discharge me. I got my discharge papers only four days later after I paid almost Rs 100,000,” he said. “I had to get a loan to pay the hospital bills as my father, who is a farmer, did not have that kind of money.”Dr Sharda Singh, the hospital director, said Suraj did not qualify for a discount as he did not have a recommendation letter from the local unit. “Patients have to get a recommendation to avail of free services at private hospitals but Suraj could not bring one,” she said. “I was in the hospital bed for four days. I could not have secured a recommendation from the local unit in that state,” said Suraj. Ishwari Prasad Chapagain, a civil society leader of Rupandehi and a member of the Consumer Interest Protection Forum, says private hospitals in Butwal are more interested in making money than helping those in need. “They do not follow government mandates. They act as if they have to bear the expenses of providing free service to the poor when in fact they get tax rebates and such for such services,” he said. “The sub-metropolis also does not do the needful. Everyone is corrupt including the city officials.”  \nDuring my recent visit to Bajura District, I explored olive farming and witnessed its current state in the region. My interaction with Janesh Bhandari, a local civic campaigner, revealed the unfortunate stagnation of a once-promising project. Funded by the Italian government with approximately 1.4 million Euros allocated for Kathmandu, Dolpa and Bajura, this project saw half of the funds directed to Bajura alone. Preliminary research identified that out of 28 species planted, 24 bore fruit, and 10 were recommended for Nepal.Following the success of the pilot study, the Government of Nepal (GoN) has designated Bajura, encompassing the municipalities of Jagannath, Himali, Swamikartik and Budhinanda, as an olive zone. In 2016, an Olive Zone Implementation Unit was established under the Prime Minister Agriculture Modernisation (2015-25) Project. The main goal of this unit is to promote commercial olive farming and enhance the management and utilisation of natural olive forests to increase farmers’ incomes. Despite such significant investment in research, commercial olive farming remains unfruitful, owing to several challenges.ProspectsEmpirical evidence suggests that olive farming in Bajura could serve as a nature-based solution to diversify the local production system. Investing in both wild and domesticated olives could boost household incomes and generate employment in the region. Given the environmental, social and economic benefits, olive cultivation could enhance the resilience and well-being of smallholding farmers. Research also highlights olive as a crop with a high potential for income, employment opportunities and improvement in economic status.Olive oil is a common product in Nepal, but olive wood handicrafts are globally popular. Handicraft items from olive wood fetch high prices, including wooden bowls and plates, which sell at a range of $20-70. Olive oil is also used in producing soaps, scents, skincare and other cosmetics. Nepal imported olive products worth $616,217 in 2022, which shows a year-on-year value growth of 70.38 percent. With olive oil prices in the Nepali market ranging from Rs2,000 to 3,000 per litre, the market potential for olive oil and its diversified products is substantial, making systematic cultivation a promising avenue for import substitution. The Prime Minister's Agriculture Modernisation Project has initiated a programme to construct infrastructure for olive farming and provide relief of Rs427,000 for 2,386 farmers in Bajura.ChallengesDespite Bajura being designated as an olive production zone, several challenges hinder the commercial farming of olives. One major issue is the underutilisation of wild olives due to the lack of collection and processing centres. In addition to these, another challenge was the lack of a three-phase electricity line essential for the production centre's operation, rendering the plant dysfunctional at the moment.Additionally, there is a significant mindset barrier among farmers and local people. Olive trees take five years to bear fruit, and most farmers attracted to faster-yielding crops like apples are reluctant to invest in olive cultivation. The farmers’ economic status exacerbates this reluctance, as they cannot afford to wait for such a long harvest period.Another challenge is the lack of a technically skilled workforce. Some farmers have fallen short of the necessary knowledge about olive cultivation and its benefits, and others have shifted to high-value crops, abandoning traditional farming practices in the region. Educating them about the economic and health benefits of olive farming could prove beneficial. Policy measuresNepal can draw inspiration from Rajasthan, India, where the government actively promoted olive cultivation by introducing Israeli technology and operational models. The Government of India included olives under the national mission on oilseeds and oil palm. After eight years of nurturing olive saplings, this led to the successful launch of Rajasthan's first indigenous olive oil brand. Similarly, Pakistan has seen impressive success in olive farming. In 2022, the country exported virgin and extra virgin olive oil worth $1.9 million. This achievement was enabled by a project launched in 2012 by the Pakistani government, in cooperation with the Italian government, called \"Promotion of Olive Cultivation for Economic Development and Poverty Alleviation\". This project, run through the Pakistan Agriculture Research Council (PARC), has provided Pakistani farmers with training on pruning techniques and technological support. As a result, Italy and Pakistan now enjoy an annual trade relationship worth €2 billion.With the government initiating an olive zone, it is now crucial for local authorities to take ownership of the project and explore the commercial viability of olive oil extraction. Currently, only a few informed individuals at the policy level are aware of the prospects. Disseminating information to local farmers and communities is imperative, as olive is not a part of Nepal's traditional lifestyle and food habits. The government should implement policy measures such as incorporating olive farming into the curriculum of universities and schools. Agricultural universities should encourage students to intern in olive farming regions for practical experience.Once commercial farming is established, Nepal should register with the International Olive Council to gain wider recognition. Agricultural documents should highlight olives as prospective crops, and proper national records should be maintained on the status of wild and commercially farmed olives. Additionally, it is essential to have trained technicians and experts to oversee olive cultivation and farming. With coordinated action from the government, local officials, farmers and other key stakeholders, olive cultivation could become a lucrative endeavour in Nepal. This could help diversify the country's agriculture sector and foster economic development. \nAs temperatures rise, cities across the globe face the threat of extreme heat. Between 2002 and 2010, Nepal had more than two dozen destructive heatwaves, with the most severe occurring in 2009 and 2010, leading to 25 deaths and affecting 280 individuals. Alarmingly, about 80 percent of Nepal’s population is at risk from natural and climate-induced hazards like heat waves.Cities suffer more from heat waves for a few reasons. First is the urban heat island effect, where cities get hotter than villages. This happens because cities are cramped with people, buildings and infrastructure that absorb and retain heat. So, urban centres remain hot even at night when things should cool down, creating a hot bubble over the city that is several degrees warmer than outside. In particular, Kathmandu’s built-up area is almost four times what it was in the mid-1980s. Also, everything we do in cities, like running air conditioners, driving vehicles, working in factories and doing industrial activities, creates even more heat.Additionally, urban centres lack trees or open water bodies to cool things down naturally. This puts city dwellers, especially older people and those with health issues or limited resources, at risk. Addressing these challenges requires innovative urban planning and integrated green infrastructure.Growing threatNepal is witnessing a rise in both the frequency and intensity of heat waves, particularly in cities. The Ministry of Health and Population recently urged the public to take preventive measures against heat waves. The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) reports that the impact of heat waves became more severe in 2023, making life increasingly difficult. A study by the Department of Hydrology and Meteorology (DHM), Government of Nepal, 2017 showed that Nepal’s average maximum temperature has risen by 0.056 degrees Celsius, with most places getting hotter yearly.Heat is causing major problems, especially for the poor and underprivileged. High temperatures contribute to drought, forest fires and floods, posing serious threats to human health, lives and the nation’s economy. For instance, on April 19, 2023, there were more than 2,800 forest fires in Nepal in a single day. Following the massive forest fire across the country, Kathmandu became one of the world's most polluted cities, according to the Air Quality Index. Also, this year, over 4,500 wildfires have been reported in the country, almost double last year's, mostly because it’s getting hotter. These heatwaves don’t just hurt people right away. Being out in the heat for a long time can cause serious health problems and chronic conditions, such as cardiovascular and respiratory diseases. Feeling tired, dizzy, thirsty, headaches, leg cramps, muscle pain, vomiting, dizziness and fainting are immediate signs of too much exposure to excessive heat. Heat-related severe illnesses like heat stroke need immediate medical attention, and this puts more pressure on healthcare systems. The economic cost is significant, too, with damage to infrastructure, reduced productivity and increased energy demands for cooling.Recent findingsA recent study in the Theoretical and Applied Climatology journal examines the spatiotemporal characterisation of heatwaves in Kathmandu. It develops a methodological framework and suggests ways to lessen the heat impacts. Utilising satellite-based data, essential for developing countries like Nepal where adequate measuring stations are lacking, the study shows that higher temperatures are concentrated in valleys with high population densities. It is high time we took appropriate mitigation measures in urban planning, building infrastructure and at the household and community levels. The study also highlights a notable rise in extreme heatwave conditions, especially from 2012 onwards. A significant urban warming trend, primarily observed in densely populated regions, suggests that the elderly and youth with limited capacities are highly vulnerable to extreme heat. Mitigation strategiesCities need to plan better and include more green spaces to deal with the growing risk of heatwaves. We must figure out how much cooler and to what spatial extent parks, ponds and forests serve effectively. By optimising the design, distribution and maintenance of green infrastructure, cities can use nature to cool things down and make cities resilient. Parks and gardens don’t just provide shade; they also cool things by letting water evaporate from plants and water bodies. Another strategy involves using appropriate construction materials, such as cool roofs and pavements. Vegetation-covered green roofs can also help keep buildings cooler.Policy implicationsPolicies encouraging the adoption of green infrastructure, regulations on urban heat management and incentives for buildings using cool roofing materials can make a significant difference. Public awareness campaigns are also crucial. We must teach everyone about why green infrastructure is good and ways to stay safe in the heat, like drinking enough water and not toiling too much outside when it is super hot.The escalating threat of heatwaves in Nepal’s cities demands immediate and innovative action. Integrating green spaces, water bodies, and other natural elements into urban design is not just an option anymore—we must make cities good places for the next generation to live. The future of city life in a warming world depends on our ability to innovate and adapt. It is high time to make our cities that withstand the challenges of climate change and be great places to live. It’s a job for everyone—governments, city planners and people from all walks of life—to work together to make cities cooler. \nNepal faced economic challenges while other countries embraced participatory budgeting initiatives to empower citizens in budget allocation, highlighting the need for Nepal to embrace participatory budgeting for greater transparency and accountability.\nOver half of Nepal's SEE examinees fail, highlighting the education system's deep-seated flaws, despite a grading system implemented in 2016.\nAfter 14 years of asylum, imprisonment, and legal battles, WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange is released after pleading guilty to conspiring to obtain classified documents, while WikiLeaks' revelations and the ensuing backlash against Assange and the free press continue to raise concerns about the suppression of dissent globally.\nIllegal road building and river extraction in Nepal damage sensitive areas, posing risks to the environment, wildlife, and humans, despite laws and government apathy.\nOver 52% of students failed SEE due to teacher underperformance, poor grading system implementation, and lack of infrastructure despite the introduction of a letter grading system intended to align with international standards.\nFollowing Ambassador recalls from 11 countries, Nepal's Prime Minister Dahal's visit to New Delhi yielded bilateral progress, including energy trade, connectivity, and investment advancements, while BRI projects and trade agreements with China face delays.\nThe government has decided to make the National ID Card mandatory in order to receive services from government and public institutions. In the first phase, the June 6 Cabinet meeting made the National ID card number mandatory in 28 districts. People including federal lawmakers criticised the decision saying that it was enforced without first distributing the cards. In this context, Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal sat down with Yubaraj Katel, director general of the Department of National ID and Civil Registration.Let’s begin with a basic question. Why do we need a National ID card while we already have citizenship certificate, driving license, passport and voting card?There is a fundamental difference between a citizenship card and National ID. Citizenship establishes whether you are a citizen of the country and it helps you identify yourself with some basic details. In Nepal, it was also widely used as a service card. Wherever you go, you have to show the citizenship card—to open a bank account or acquire a SIM card for a phone. If we study international practices, there are mainly two cards—one is an identity card and the other is a service card. In 2018, the Nepal government came up with the idea of distributing national identity cards with a unique digital number for each eligible citizen. The number can track not only the individual but also the person’s activities and movements. This project has various components. First is data collection. It has two categories—demographic data, such as the names of father, mother and other family members. Second is biometric data—fingerprints, eye retina and digital signature. The biometric data is crucial to create a unique identity of each individual and avoid duplication in the integrated national database. The National ID has these two types of data. The other tasks are enrollment of the data, printing and distribution of the cards and then providing services based on that. At present, people carry multiple cards in their pockets. The objective of this project is to replace all of them by a single card–National ID. The new card includes vital details of all other cards in its chip with 1GB storage capacity. The government wanted to trace people based on their unique individual numbers so that there is no need to print and carry multiple cards. There is a huge industry of printing separate cards for each and every service that is creating a jumble of information. The National ID will not only replace multiple cards but also help authorities control criminal activities like financial frauds by removing duplication. At present, government authorities have difficulty in tracing and identifying an individual and wrongdoers are benefitting from that situation.What cards will be replaced by the National ID?It has a chip with 1GB storage capacity where you can store your driving license, academic documents, voting card, insurance details, ATM card number, etc. For instance, if you go to a telecom company to acquire a SIM card, they will ask for a copy of your citizenship card. You can say, ‘no, I have a National ID card’. Once you give your number and fingerprint, they can immediately verify it through the system. Another objective is to help people get rid of filling up pages of forms for each service. International governance has a norm that says don’t ask citizens their information more than once. A state agency should seek the information once and provide it to other state agencies if they require it. People complain that many agencies don’t accept National ID. They still ask for a citizenship card for official record and verification. So, in practice, it didn’t help people reduce the number of cards in their pockets. In fact, it added one more.Therefore, the June 6 Cabinet decision made the use of National ID cards compulsory in 28 districts. Now, it is going to be essential to get social security allowances, pensions and claim health insurance. The Health Insurance Board has said it has become challenging for them to verify whether a claimant is the rightful one. The board has 8 million policyholders. We will give them our details. Then, they can cross-check the authenticity of a claimant. This will help avoid huge financial frauds. In fact, the government should have made it mandatory earlier.But people including lawmakers in the federal parliament have strongly opposed the decision saying that the government made National ID mandatory without first distributing the cards to the people.Nepal’s total population is over 30 million. Our principal stakeholders are citizenship card holders. Those 16-year-olds are eligible for citizenship cards. The Election Commission distributes voting cards to those above 18 years. We got the data from the commission and added 20 percent and estimated that we have 18.6 people above 16 years old. As of Friday, we have already distributed the National ID numbers to 14.9 million people. Now, as per our estimate, around 3.7 million people are yet to get the National ID. Millions of people are abroad. Thus, we are headed towards saturation point in terms of data collection and issuance of the numbers. One thing I want to stress is that people don’t need a hard copy of the National ID card. The number is sufficient. Printing cards is costly. We have to pay around 2 euro to procure a blank card. The cost of printing, delivery and other overhead expenses is added to that. With the task of printing over a billion copies of ID cards being too costly, even India discourages use of hard copy of the cards. You can create the QR code of your card, save it in your mobile or print it in a paper and scan it wherever you need it.Officials at our government agencies bring up the rule that makes it mandatory to present a physical copy of citizenship card or other documents for official works.Yes, we are trained and habituated in that way. Now we need to change. We must make offices paperless while developing a strong database system. We have been using citizenship cards to verify the identity of a person for a long time. Biometrics not only helps identify people but also trace their activities. Recently, Rs2 billion was found in the bank accounts of a 26-year-old man. The money was deposited in 56 bank accounts. He used 13 ATM cards and 17 phone numbers. Once the National ID card is implemented, transactions and movements of such wrongdoers will be easily traced and monitored. Identifying individuals accurately is crucial to ensure good governance and strengthen security. Many people have acquired fake citizenship cards. People even made fake passports. Implementation of National ID will control it. It is also related to our national image. It will help improve the status of our passport and add authenticity to our other documents as well.Once the National ID comes into wide use, our details will be traced and used by multiple agencies. State agencies and other institutions benefit from the integrated database as they can easily trace us. But how do you ensure our data isn’t misused and it doesn’t make us insecure?If you have a National ID card, you don’t need a hard copy of your driving licence. There is a backlog of around 2.1 million licences. The government has failed to print and distribute them. We told them, we have already procured 12 million cards. Of them, 3.2 million cards have already been printed and we still need to print around 8 million cards. Once the licence data is integrated with the National ID card, it will be shown there. Now, to come to your question, only the traffic authority can access the licence-related data. The device they use will trace only relevant data. Only an authorised agency will get access to the data and it can’t be used for anything other than the stated purpose. We give access to agencies like Nepal Rastra Bank, Nepal Telecommunication Authority and Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal. Then they regulate the things in their domain. No unauthorised body or individual can access it. Do the implementing agencies have infrastructure to use this technology?We are in a position to implement it in some parts of the country. Therefore, we are implementing it in phases. We are making it mandatory for certain services in 28 districts from mid-July. We should have started much earlier. It must be expedited.Lawmakers said in a Parliament meeting that the decision has ‘terrorised people’ in the 28 districts as locals feared they might be deprived of the services as the government has made National ID cards mandatory without first distributing them.We started the National ID registration process from 2018. Registration teams reached in each local ward except in Mugu and Humla districts of Karnali. It was carried out as a campaign. Even after the drive’s completion, the registration process was open in all the 77 districts, 54 area administration offices and in palika (local unit) centres. We also had registration centres in major downtowns. We receive data of around 4,000 registrations a day. So, there has been sufficient initiative and enough time to encourage people to get the number. Besides, if anyone in the 28 districts are still to get the ID number, they still have three months to register.You said only an ID number but no hard copy was needed to access any kind of service, right?Exactly. There is no provision that states one should produce a hard copy to get any service. You give the number and your biometrics to verify that you are the right person. Then, the official can crosscheck it in the database within seconds.Do all the implementing agencies have the devices that read the National ID cards?We have distributed 4,200 machines that read the cards in 333 local units of the 28 districts. Likewise, we have asked other local units and districts and some agencies such as banks to procure the devices and we have given the specifications based on their requirements. A device costs just around Rs 1,500. You can enter the number and place your thumbprint on it. We have trained relevant officials from all the local units for the purpose.How many cards can the department print at present?We can produce 1,500 cards an hour. But now we are producing only 1,800 a day. We have the strength to distribute 30,000 cards a day but are distributing only 5,000 a day.Again the same question. Then why are people not getting the cards?There is some communication gap. People who registered in 2018 or 2019 haven’t contacted us. We are giving them priority to clear the backlogs. But people who are newly-registered are showing more interest. So, we need to strike the right balance.When will the department be in a position to distribute the cards to all the people?At present, we can print 100,000 cards a month. We have a space to double the capacity. Meanwhile, people have now shown more interest. By enhancing our facilities’ capacity, we can print the pending 8 million cards in the next 40 months.What about election cards? Do we need to register for that and get the voting cards?In fact, the Election Commission doesn’t need to collect data and issue cards. We will talk to them. As a constitutional body, we have to readily make the data available for them. In fact, the National ID Card system can help the commission make voting arrangements for the Nepalis abroad because it can accurately identify the right person and can immediately update the integrated system here in Nepal about the votes cast in any country. This card will be helpful in conducting fair elections because the biometric data stored in this system will be perfect bases to identify the people and instantly update the activities in the database.You have emphasised replacement of other cards by the National ID cards. How long may it take to do so?We plan on giving priority to three sectors—banking, civil aviation and telecom. People right now need to fill separate forms for these services that have irked the service seekers. We have asked the bankers to buy the devices. We as a supplier are ready. Now the stakeholders should be ready too. It will benefit them because it helps control frauds.What if I don’t register for the National ID card?In the first place, you will be deprived of social security funds, pension, insurance policies. Likewise, the government will gradually make the card compulsory to receive many other services such as driving licence, land transaction, telephone numbers, bank accounts. How do you assure that our data stored in this system isn’t misused?See, the current practices make you more vulnerable. Because multiple agencies take your data for various purposes. Do they have a system to protect the data and ensure that it isn’t misused? But when your data is stored only by a dedicated government agency, it will be more secure as the agency is specialised for that. When other authorised agencies seek data, we give them access only to the relevant one. We have a National Identity Management Information System (NIMIS). We have maintained three layers of security—L1, L2, L3—to ensure foolproof security of the data. There are three servers.Are we dependent on any foreign company for any related service?So far, only one international vendor is involved but we are cutting down its involvement as well, with a plan to ultimately replace it by our own agency. The vendor now helps transfer collected data to the printing machine through the Automated Biometric Identification System (ABIS). But our plan is to do so through our own government agency or local vendor. We do all the other tasks. Security printing is done within the office basement where every movement of people is monitored and recorded. \nPrithvi Subba Gurung, deputy general secretary of the CPN-UML, is one of the leaders who strongly lobbied for a federal system while the Constituent Assembly was writing the constitution between 2008 to 2015. Eight years after the adoption of the federal democratic republican constitution, the federal system, particularly the provinces, are widely being criticised for their supposed failure to deliver. The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal asks former Gandaki chief minister Gurung what went wrong in the course of implementing the federal system.The implementation of the federal system has faced several hurdles since its adoption. Most provinces have for months failed even to form the governments, let alone run them efficiently. Where is the problem?We have adopted a federal system but are working against its spirit. Provinces should run autonomously. On some key issues, federal leaders and the party’s central bodies may give some direction to their provincial bodies. But most provincial activities are still centrally-governed even years after the adoption of federalism. So, our practices aren’t in line with the system. The provincial governments shouldn’t have been affected by the changes in the federal coalition. Such problems were seen in India years ago. But they have learned from their experience. In our case, leaders of major political parties treated the provincial governments as party chapters. The provincial governments are formed and run as per the constitution and all the three tiers of the governments are autonomous. The high commands in our political parties aren’t ready to accept the new constitutional setup.Are the provincial leaders equally responsible as they seek Kathmandu’s nod before taking any important decisions?They seek the centre’s support because they are trained in that way. They are too dependent on the centre. You said India learned by experience and now provinces there work more autonomously. But, in Nepal, provinces are now witnessing more problems than during their first tenure, which is evident also in the difficulties in government formation in multiple provinces. Why couldn’t they learn from the five-year experience?Nepal’s leaders and political parties are still not committed to federalism. They have failed to implement the federal system as per the spirit of the constitution. This is the major problem. The big parties as well as their leaders are guided by a centralised mindset and still prefer working in a unitary system. We should not forget that we transformed the executive and legislative bodies into three tiers of federal systems. But our judiciary retained the old structure. Therefore, the judiciary doesn’t accept the federal system and its practice in a true sense. Its verdicts reflect the same.The role of Speakers and Province Heads has courted controversies in multiple provinces. The top court invalidated some of their decisions. Is it because of lack of clarity, faults in our constitutional provisions, or is it because of the leaders?Speaker and Province Head are political posts created in accordance with constitutional provisions. When overall politics is dirty and unhealthy, those taking up these responsibilities also feel compelled to resort to similar tactics. When overall politics improves, they automatically make better decisions. Mainly there is no leader in the high command who completely owns federalism and is determined to implement it in its true spirit. This government in its policies and programmes unveiled last month had rightly said that “protecting federalism and strengthening the federal democratic republic is our top priority”. But the budget failed to introduce programmes as per the promises made in the policies and programmes.How do we correct these anomalies? Where do we begin?We are in a complex situation. Many have started to float the idea of making amendments to the constitution. But we shouldn’t forget that various forces and stakeholders had their own positions during constitution-making. They made compromises and found middle grounds to promulgate the constitution. If we go for amendments, they all will return to their respective stances. Some may want to revive the Hindu Kingdom while others will stand against it. Some leaders even within Nepali Congress have started to advocate for constitutional monarchy. But we can’t regress to the monarchical system. We can’t renounce secularism and an inclusive democratic system. We can’t backtrack on our commitment to a socialism-oriented system. We may explore some changes in our electoral system or form of governance without going against these key features of our constitution but we can’t destabilise the charter. What are the major flaws to be fixed?There are some. For instance, provinces have no role in education. The responsibility of education up to secondary level is given to the local level. And, everything is controlled by the federal government. The local units are entrusted with key responsibilities such as developing curriculum, overseeing the issues of career developments of teachers and staffers and their promotion as well as transfers etcetera. Local units can’t do all of these things efficiently as they have their own limitations. How can a local unit transfer a teacher from Kaski to Lamjung? Provinces should have been given such responsibilities. The power has been centralised at Singha Durbar. Such is also the situation in other sectors.Though the proportional representation (PR) system is hailed as one of the most beautiful features of our constitution in terms of ensuring inclusion, it has also been blamed for political instability. Many have demanded revision in the electoral system.The major political parties such as the CPN-UML and Nepali Congress have not trained their party members on the proper implementation of key constitutional features such as federalism and electoral system. The party members and general people have either wrongly understood it, or have negative impressions about the systems. These systems were adopted with an objective to resolve our decade-long conflict and address the concerns of the historically marginalised communities and even mainstream some groups through an inclusive democratic system. The idea was to integrate all the communities and maintain unity in diversity. After holding years-long debates on various options, we agreed on the mixed electoral system so as to reflect our diversity in the state agencies.As the proverb goes, “the bad workman blames his tools”, our leaders are blaming the system for their failure to secure a majority by winning people’s trust. Many countries that practise similar electoral systems have progressed. Our electoral system and the form of governance are not causing political instability. Many countries have adopted a parliamentary system and many others have practised the presidential model. Countries have progressed in both the systems. Also, there are examples of failures under both setups. So, the problem lies in our political parties and leaders, not in the systems. Shouldn’t political parties like the UML and Congress work with a plan to secure a majority by winning people’s trust? They aren’t training their focus on that but blaming the system. At times, they have squandered the majority as well and have failed to keep the party intact. Isn’t it our [leaders’] failure?Some argue that the issue of the fractured mandate can be addressed by increasing the threshold ceiling for political parties to be eligible to get PR votes and that can be done by amending election laws. Does it help?This is the idea coming from big political parties because they get more votes when fringe parties disqualify for PR votes. But a higher ceiling may deprive many small parties from representing certain communities. So, this goes against the spirit of inclusion. What we need is a good coalition culture. If we see the trend of recent decades, Indian politicians have become much more mature in this context. In the past, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi accommodated his electoral alliance partners in his ruling coalition even though his party won the majority single-handedly. If we scrap the inclusive electoral system, won’t the marginalised communities again revolt? We should be careful about that.At times, leaders have helped dissident groups split their party. These are the same leaders who issued an ordinance to change the provision that required a group within a political party to show support of 40 percent members of the party’s central committee “and” the parliamentary party. Only then could it split. They changed the threshold to 20 percent, and the “and” provision had been changed to “or”. The provision of requiring 40 percent support on both sides had earlier been included to ensure political stability. But the leaders who are helping party divisions are blaming the system for instability in the country. So, we [leaders] have to mend our ways, not blame the system. The Rastriya Swantantra Party, the fourth-largest in the lower house, has officially said that it wants to overhaul the federal system and drastically downsize the provinces. Also, leaders within the major parties who earlier stood in favour of federalism have started criticising it. On Saturday, Congress General Secretary Gagan Thapa said the country can’t sustain the provinces in their present form. What is your view?I am one of those who advocated for a federal system even before the first Constituent Assembly because Nepal is a country full of discrimination based on caste, class, region and religion. We advocated for the system to do away with these discriminations and find a system to maintain unity within diversity. Federalism is the best system to promote national unity as all groups get their own space as per their unique features. For instance, if you make multiple rooms in a building, you can give space and adjust more people. But if you keep many people inside a big room, they will have difficulties—no matter how big the room is. We should strengthen the federal system. We can’t regress.Then, why do many people see provinces as a burden?In Nepal, the federal system was projected as a structure that resulted in huge liability to the state coffers. But the facts don’t substantiate it. A local unit in the federal structure replaced many erstwhile Village Development Committees (VDCs). For instance, in my home district of Lamjung, eight palikas covered the areas of 61 VDCs, and the expenditure of the current eight local units is no more than that of the erstwhile 61 VDCs. Now we don’t need 77 district coordination committees. They can be scrapped. No province needs more than seven ministers. Likewise, the federal Cabinet can be drastically downsized. Why do we need a 25-strong Cabinet at the centre when we already have seven other provincial cabinets? Twelve ministries are enough at the centre, as suggested by the high level commission on administration reform.There are many departments and divisions that were designed under the unitary system that have become completely redundant in the federal setup. So many project offices established over two decades ago based on the needs of that time are still there. These irrelevant bodies should be scrapped. This is how we can significantly cut down on administrative costs. Leaders and people don’t discuss that. They only blame provinces. \nLawmaker Jiban Pariyar, a joint general secretary of the Nepali Congress, the main opposition, was a member of the four-member taskforce that prepared the terms of reference (ToR) of the parliamentary committee to probe the cooperative scam. The taskforce finalised it after a prolonged dispute over whether to categorically mention Deputy Prime Minister and Home Minister Rabi Lamichhane’s name while defining the committee’s jurisdiction. The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal talked to him about the ToR finalisation process and other aspects of the probe. It took weeks to finalise the ToR and jurisdiction of the parliamentary committee formed to probe the cooperative scam. How did you finally reach an agreement? I will give a brief context first. Cases of cooperative frauds had been made public even in the past. But this time, some groups and gangs were seen to be working in an organised way to embezzle billions of rupees deposited by common people. Some established people, including those active in politics, were found to be misusing the people’s hard-earned money. This issue was thus urgent and our party Nepali Congress raised it strongly in Parliament. We had raised this issue even when we were in the government [before March 4]. We had raised it with erstwhile home minister Narayankaji Shrestha in parliamentary committees and other platforms. We had talked to him about the involvement of lawmakers and other politicians in such scams.But the Congress raised this issue more strongly after the party quit the government.This is true, and for a good reason. We demanded a parliamentary committee to probe this issue after our party’s exit from the government because Rabi Lamichhane, someone linked with some big cooperative scams, became home minister. We raised this issue after he was allowed to lead the same ministry and police agencies that were supposed to be investigating the scams. Earlier, various agencies within Nepal Police and other government bodies were looking into the matter. Erstwhile home minister Shrestha had assured us of an independent and fair investigation. Lamichhane transferred police officials who were investigating the scams, and tried to protect cooperative operators involved in wrongdoing. Based on all these activities, we concluded that a parliamentary probe committee is a must and we firmly stood for the same. Initially, we raised this issue in Parliament without obstructing House proceedings but the government compelled us to disrupt the meetings after it refused to address our concerns. The prime minister tried to give Lamichhane a clean chit by saying that he was not involved in the cooperative scams. Also, the Nepal Police chief at a parliamentary committee meeting said that the home minister wasn’t under investigation as he had done nothing wrong. In the meantime, the attorney general issued a letter stating that no cooperative-related case was registered against Lamichhane. It became clear that the government agencies wouldn’t investigate the issue independently. Then, we raised the issue strongly and we even had to obstruct Parliament meetings. After the pressure, top leaders from the ruling as well as opposition parties agreed to form a parliamentary committee to investigate the matter. The leaders formed a task force led by Law, Justice and Parliamentary Affairs Minister Padam Giri and entrusted us with preparing the committee’s ToR and defining its jurisdiction.But at the task force meetings, members from the ruling parties lobbied to define the committee’s jurisdiction in a way that only allowed for investigation into the wrongdoings of cooperatives and their operators but not those involved in syphoning money from there through illegal means. They argued that only those who issued the loans should be made liable, not those who obtained it. Their intent was to protect Rabi Lamichhane. But I insisted that our duty is to find where the common people’s money has been spent or misused and then to return the money to the depositors. I insisted on investigating Lamichhane as various studies have shown his involvement in the misuse of depositors’ money.Then, we started exchanging written proposals. We exchanged and discussed many such proposals in writing. We insisted on mentioning the names of Lamichhane and the Gorkha Media Network—where Lamichhane and GB Rai invested tens of millions of cooperatives’ money—and ensuring that the depositors get their money back. After a long negotiation, members from the UML became a bit flexible. But the Rastriya Swatantra Party of Lamichhane continued to be rigid. Then, we finally agreed to mention the names of the cooperatives from where Lamichhane and his former colleagues had obtained money and to name Gorkha Media Network but not Lamichhane.But won’t keeping out the name of the sitting home minister create more confusion and disputes?There is no need to be confused. The ToR has stated the name of Gorkha Media Network, where Lamichhane and his team invested the money they got from the cooperatives, and the ToR’s Annex-2 has a list of cooperatives from where they obtained the money. It has also stated that “responsible officials of the company” involved in such transactions would also be investigated. Even other firms and individuals linked to the transactions will be probed. So there is no chance of keeping Lamichhane away from investigation. The committee’s jurisdiction defined in the ToR is clear on this.Will your party ask for Lamichhane’s resignation after the committee starts investigating him?Our party is yet to formally demand the home minister’s resignation. But questions have been raised about him in Parliament, in various public platforms and in the media. Also, the general public has raised this issue. He knows the committee will summon him for interrogation. A few months ago, when a minister [from Congress] was summoned by the Commission for Investigation of Abuse of Authority, Lamichhane was the one who strongly demanded the minister’s resignation in Parliament. He will soon face the parliamentary inquiry committee. Let’s see how he faces it. Leaders from ruling parties including the prime minister have accused the Congress of personally targeting Lamichhane after he refused to join a Congress-led coalition in which he was offered the prime ministerial position.Leaders from new parties should understand that political leaders engage in dialogue with all political forces. Some meetings are convened in a strategic way. This is natural in a democracy. Also, Lamichhane met with our party president. But they spread a rumour that our party president offered him the prime ministerial position. That’s not true. The argument that we targeted him after he refused to join our coalition is baseless. The Congress has officially decided that the probe committee can investigate any of our members suspected of wrongdoings. Has any other party made such a decision officially? We have also officially challenged the home minister to prove the allegations he labelled at our party leaders from Parliament’s rostrum. We have also challenged him to investigate and prove the charges.When the names of head and members of the parliamentary probe committee became public, many thought that the parties didn’t give due importance to the panel as they nominated relatively low-profile lawmakers. Why didn’t the parties choose powerful leaders to investigate a national crisis of this magnitude?This is a wrong perception. All members are federal parliamentarians. They shouldn’t be judged based on their personalities and profiles. The committee is powerful because it has a mandate from the House, and its jurisdiction and the ToR give it power. What we should carefully follow is their work. They can invite experts and specialists—such as chartered accountants, bankers, account specialists—if they require technical expertise during the investigation.Lamichhane himself is chair of the fourth-largest party, which has a decisive role in the ruling coalition. Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal and CPN-UML chair KP Sharma Oli had initially ruled out any need of investigation into the home minister. In this context, can the committee members freely conduct the investigation?I am confident that even the committee member from the RSP can’t defend his leader when the documents and facts show that the money was illegally released. How can other members protect him? I believe they will conduct the investigation independently and come up with a consensus report. Documents, facts and figures guide investigation. This isn’t like leaders giving statements on public platforms. We are not saying he must be proven guilty as the Congress has blamed him. He may prove to be innocent after investigation. We should accept if the evidence proves Lamichhane innocent. The bottom line is that the investigation should be fair. Many Congress leaders are also involved in cooperative scams and other corruption cases. So people suspect that leaders will eventually trade off and the probe panel will be only an eyewash.This investigation cannot be weakened under any pretext. I am saying this based on the documents and evidence I have studied. Also, the media and other stakeholders such as the study report of Pokhara Metropolitan City and the investigation report of Rupandehi District Police, among others, have already made ample evidence public. It’s not easy to acquit the guilty.What will Congress’ approach be if the committee, where ruling parties have a majority, fails to decide by consensus and members take decisions on a majority basis?In the seven-member panel, there are two members from our party and one from the Rastriya Prajatantra Party. If those from the ruling parties pushed for a wrong decision based on their majority, members from opposition parties will counter that and register their differing views. If such a situation arises they will be free to make the reality public and they can even bring out a different report.Was Congress under pressure to reach an agreement as there were reports that the government was preparing to unveil the budget through ordinance citing opposition’s House obstruction?We weren’t worried about that. In fact, the prime minister’s initiatives and his seriousness to end the House deadlock played a crucial role in helping us reach this agreement. \nThe weather across the country will be generally to mostly cloudy on Monday.

Write it in the form of inspiring story not news article or event.\n    \n    Story:\nOnce upon a time, nestled between the towering peaks of the Himalayas and the lush jungles of the Terai, there was a country named Nepal. Though still a developing nation, Nepal was a land of profound beauty and deep-rooted cultural heritage. The residents of Nepal faced many challenges, but beneath these hardships lay a resilient spirit and an unyielding hope for the future.\n\nThis enchanting land, where Mount Everest reaches towards the skies and the air carries a mix of incense and cool mountain breezes, was more than a geographical marvel. It was a mosaic of cultures, languages, and traditions, a testament to human endeavor against all odds. Nepal's history, from the unification under King Prithvi Narayan Shah to its transformation into a federal democratic republic, told a story of aspiration and endurance.\n\nIn recent years, the people of Nepal, with their indomitable will, had taken strides towards rebuilding and reimagining their country. They turned their struggles into stepping stones, each challenge a chapter in their ongoing saga. The shift from a monarchy to a republic had not only changed governance but had woven a new tapestry of democratic values and collective decision-making.\n\nEconomically, while agriculture continued to sustain a large part of its population, Nepal had begun to harness the potential of its picturesque landscapes, developing sustainable tourism that promised to preserve their natural heritage while boosting local economies. Communities living in the shadows of the Himalayas had become stewards of the earth, protecting the biodiversity that made their country unique.\n\nEach day brought new stories. Whether it was a festival in Kathmandu, a technological advance in Pokhara, or a conservation effort in Chitwan, these events were threads in the vibrant quilt of Nepali life. These stories, updated daily, reflected the pulse of progress and the spirit of hope that characterized this resilient nation.\n\nAnd so, as Nepal moved forward, each moment was not just a passage of time but a promise of potential, a narrative of a nation perennially climbing towards tomorrow, guided by the legacy of its past and the dreams of its future.\n\nNews events:\nKP Sharma Oli has pulled out yet another rabbit from his old bag of tricks. Barely four months after extending support to Pushpa Kamal Dahal’s leadership of the government, CPN-UML, the second largest party in Parliament, has decided to end its political association with Dahal and join hands with Nepali Congress, the largest party. Saturday’s apparently sudden meeting between Nepali Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba and CPN-UML chair KP Oli at the latter’s residence laid the ground for a potential new political alliance between the two parties.Multiple senior Congress and UML leaders told the Post that Deuba and Oli had already reached an understanding in a meeting on Sunday midnight at an undisclosed location in Kathmandu, where they tentatively agreed to form a new government, amend the constitution, and to work out a power-sharing formula, which they reportedly shared with a few confidants. As per the understanding between Congress and UML, Oli will lead a new ‘national consensus’ government for a year and a half. For the remaining term, Deuba will be the prime minister, a Nepali Congress leader who is preparing a draft agreement between the two parties told the Post on Monday night. A four-member task force has prepared the draft agreement, which will be released on Tuesday. It will detail the power-sharing arrangement, propose amendments to the constitution, review the electoral system including proportional representation, change national assembly arrangements, and discuss size of provincial assemblies, according to a taskforce member. Ramesh Lekhak and Gyanendra Bahadur Karki from the Congress and Shankar Pokhrel and Ramesh Badal from the UML had held several rounds of talks in the past two weeks, said a UML leader. If everything goes according to plan, a deal will be public by Tuesday, and chairman Oli will stake claim to the post of prime minister on Tuesday itself, a UML minister said. Two Congress leaders familiar with the meeting as per the understanding between Oli and Deuba, Oli will lead the new government with the support of Nepali Congress and other fringe parties. The Congress will lead 10 ministries including home, and the UML nine including finance, as per the draft understanding. Likewise, the Congress and the UML will lead three provincial governments each, with the government in Madhesh to be led by a regional party. There has also been a verbal agreement on formation of a high-powered constitution review and suggestions committee under a former chief justice of the Supreme Court. Deuba and Oli had reportedly been in talks over the past one month in order to address some pressing national issues, and have agreed to amend the constitution where needed. They are also said to have reached understandings on foreign policy, economic crisis, and governance.One big issue that is said to have caused a rift between Prime Minister Dahal and Oli was over the appointment of the chairman of the Securities Board of Nepal or Sebon. The appointment process was ultimately cancelled on Saturday due to differences between the two leaders.Sources inside the Finance Ministry said the selection process became the victim of the political power play between the UML and the Maoist Centre, leading to the cancellation of the entire process.But after a meeting between the two on Monday morning, a Cabinet meeting later in the day decided to give continuity to the old three-member committee to nominate candidates for Sebon chair.Some media reports tried to link the latest Deuba-Oli meeting with yet another development, as it took place a day after Nepal Police arrested Bechan Jha, one of the alleged middlemen in the high-profile Bhutanese refugee scam.Police last year filed cases against politicians, bureaucrats and middlemen on charges of defrauding hundreds of people by promising to send them to the US as Bhutanese refugees. But police were not able to book Jha despite his connection with the scam.Jha is allegedly close to many political leaders, including senior Congress leaders, and the Congress leadership might have been worried that they too could be dragged into the refugee scam.Differences between Oli and Dahal had been steadily building, including over the new Sebon chair, the appointment of ambassadors to eight countries, transitional justice, and the bringing of what Oli termed a ‘Maoist budget’ for the new fiscal year. During their meeting on Monday morning, Oli reportedly requested Dahal to support him by stepping down. “I had serious discussions with Nepali Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba on the formation of a new government in order to make some changes to the constitution and to address some pressing national issues,” a UML leader quoted Oli as telling him. According to the UML leader, Dahal offered Oli the post of prime minister within the current ruling coalition, but Oli politely turned down the offer. The UML chair instead expressed his desire to lead a consensus government, the UML leader told the Post.Deuba and Oli were in talks for a month through different channels. After several rounds of back-channel talks and negotiations between the second-ranking leaders of the Nepali Congress and UML, they finally agreed to meet.According to the two UML leaders who were briefed about the latest situation, time has come to form a government based on national consensus in order to address the country’s daunting challenges.Prime Minister Dahal had called a meeting of ruling partners for 5:00 pm on Monday, but the meeting had to be postponed in light of the new situation. Dahal, who was all set to reshuffle the Cabinet, was planning to discuss the same in the meeting.   \nNepali Congress once again has reiterated that Nepal is not interested in loan funding of Belt and Road Initiatives (BRI) projects. Party spokesperson Parkash Saran Mahat said that after a meeting of the party's office bearers and former office bearers on Monday, the party concluded that Nepal should only accept grants, not loans for implementing BRI projects. “The debt burden is already high, so the party has decided that further debt should not be taken for implementing BRI projects,” he said. During the 16th round of the Nepal-China diplomatic consultation mechanism meeting, held on June 25 in Kathmandu, the two parties had planned to finalise the BRI implementation plan, but they could not agree on the modality for financing projects. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Nepal corresponded with the Prime Minister’s Office to seek approval for signing the implementation plan during the diplomatic consultation mechanism meeting attended by Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Sun Weidong, but it failed. The Congress, however, has been vocal in advocating for grants to implement BRI projects. During the Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi’s Nepal visit in March 2022, then Prime Minister Deuba had conveyed that Nepal would not implement BRI projects through loans. Congress leaders also said that President Sher Bahadur Deuba, during his meeting with CPN-UML chair KP Sharma Oli at the latter’s residence in Balkot on Saturday, discussed the funding modality of BRI. The Congress, which is the largest party in Parliament, held a gathering of its sitting and former office bearers on Monday following Saturday’s meeting between party chief Deuba and UML chair Oli. While the meeting between Deuba and Oli sparked speculations about the two parties potentially cooperating to form a government, the Congress leaders, after Monday’s meeting, dismissed such a possibility anytime soon. Congress spokesman Mahat categorically denied that the issue of Congress-UML collaboration on the government was discussed at Monday’s meeting. But he did not rule out the possibility of the two parties coming together in the future. Mahat outlined the conditions under which the two largest parties in the parliament could potentially collaborate: a stable and effective government, resolution of election-related challenges, and a clear path towards national stability and prosperity. “The Congress party believes that political issues should take precedence over the government’s role,” Mahat said. “On cooperation, our party is open to cooperating with all parties on pressing national issues.”He also said that the party is in discussion not just with the UML, but also with other parties for possible cooperation.However, a close ally of Deuba claimed that during the Saturday meeting, Deuba proposed Oli as the prime minister for the first round should the two parties cooperate to form a new government.  “As far as I know, Deuba is not in the mood to be prime minister at the moment,” the Congress leader who was present at the office bearer and former office bearer meeting on Monday told the Post. “In such circumstances, if two parties come together to form a government, Oli would lead it first.” A government of the two parties might be formed, but not in the next few days, said the Congress leader. Similarly, the Congress meeting on Monday also decided to extend the tenures of its sister organisation by six months. Their terms were expiring on July 4. “Today’s meeting decided to extend the terms of the sister organisations so that they can elect new office bearers within six months,” Jeevan Pariyar, the Deputy General Secretary of the party, told the Post. Meanwhile, Pariyar also said that the meeting decided to send the report of the party’s Mahasamiti meeting in February to the central committee for approval with amendments. During the Mahasamiti meeting, Vice-President Purna Bahadur Khadka had presented a policy document, General Secretary Gagan Thapa had proposed organisational reforms, General Secretary Bishwa Parkash Sharma had presented a document on contemporary political issues, and spokesperson Prakash Sharan Mahat a document on the economic situation, prospects and future direction. General Secretary Thapa's proposal drew controversy within the party. In it, he urged the party to contest the upcoming election on its own strength without forming any electoral alliance. Later, on March 4, the CPN (Maoist Centre) ditched its collaboration with the Congress and brought the UML into the government. The party pointed to Thapa’s proposal as a reason for a change in the ruling coalition.  \nIn 2019-20, Nepal imported 236 units of passenger electric vehicles (EVs) from China worth some Rs674 million. In the past five years, imports of EVs from China jumped 35 times, suggesting EV adoption in Nepal is now outpacing that of conventional combustion vehicles which use engines that burn fossil fuels, such as petrol or diesel. The EVs have overtaken conventional combustion vehicles.The imports of fossil fuel-consuming passenger vehicles were 10,310 units worth Rs9.24 billion in 2019-20. After four years, in the first 11 months of the current fiscal year, imports of conventional combustion vehicles were down to 3,537 units worth Rs4.21 billionHowever, overall vehicle imports have jumped from Rs65.02 billion in 2019-20 to Rs80 billion in the first 11 months of 2023-24.According to the Department of Customs, Nepal imported 11,466 units of EVs worth Rs29 billion in the first 11 months of the current fiscal year, or by mid-June. The imports were 3,870 units worth Rs11.23 billion in the same period last fiscal year. Of the total EV imports, a third came from China. Customs data show that Nepal imported 7,931 units of EVs from China, accounting for 69 percent of the total EV imports in the first 11 months of the current fiscal year. This translates to Rs21 billion in value.After China, the majority of EVs were imported from India. In the review period, imports from India amounted to Rs6 billion, or 3,277 units. Until the last fiscal year, India was Nepal's top EV supplier.The data show that Nepal imported 2,205 EVs worth Rs5.94 billion from India in the last fiscal year. In the same period, imports from China were 1,269 units worth Rs3.75 billion.Nepal’s imports of EVs jumped sharply by 158.23 percent in the first 11 months of the current fiscal year. Importers say BYD, a Chinese multinational, has taken over the Nepali market. The government collected revenue of Rs13.06 billion from the import of EVs in the review period.Akash Golchha, senior vice president of the Nepal Automobile Dealers Association, said the ongoing economic slowdown has not stopped Nepalis from buying EVs. However, petrol or diesel-run vehicle sales could have been better.EV sales and orders saw a dramatic surge before the budget was announced on May 28.Cimex Inc Pvt Ltd, the authorised distributor of BYD Auto Industry Co Ltd in Nepal, said it had achieved a milestone by delivering 50 cutting-edge BYD EVs in a single day on May 18. According to the company, all 50 units were sold from its service centre at Guheshwari, Kathmandu.According to Cimex, the company imported 4,000 EVs in the first 11 months of the current fiscal year. The import of Chinese EVs is high due to their larger production compared to India, said the company, which is among the top EV brands in Nepal. BYD’s Atto and Dolphin are the most preferred models among Nepali customers. With the recent hike in excise and customs duties, the company said the new price list of BYDs will be unveiled soon.“There was fear among buyers that the government may raise duty on EVs in the budget. As a result, the demand surged dramatically,” said Golchha. “The high import increased the stock of EVs.” Automobile dealers said that the government hiked the duty on EVs by 10 percent in the budget for the coming fiscal year 2024-25, which, however, may not impact the sales.Golchha said the government did not make drastic changes in the import duty of EVs in the budget, which may help EV sales boom in the coming days. “The EV demand will grow at a faster pace.”Auto dealers say the import boost for EVs is mainly due to banks’ easy financing. Banks lend up to 90 percent of the vehicle's cost.Finance Minister Barsha Man Pun, in the annual budget for the upcoming fiscal year, revised the customs and excise duty rates on the import of EVs. The customs duty on EVs of up to 50 kW has been increased to 15 percent from 10 percent, while a 5 percent excise duty has been imposed on them.Likewise, the government increased the customs and excise duties on EVs of 50-100 kW by 5 percent. As per the revised tariffs, the customs duty has been increased to 20 percent from 15 percent, while the excise duty has been increased to 15 percent from 10 percent.The customs duty on 100-200 kW has been raised to 30 percent from 20 percent. Similarly, those in categories 200-300 kW and more than 300 KW will be subject to customs duty of 60 percent and 80 percent, respectively. In these vehicles, the indirect tax has been raised by 20 percent each.According to EV traders, the market is flooded with various EV models, features, and looks, and customers have options to select according to their needs. They said that EVs ranging from Rs4 million to Rs5.5 million have a large customer base, while high-priced EVs are also seeing good sales.EV traders said that despite the market slowdown, the EV sector has not been affected.“One interesting emerging trend is that people who already own conventional combustion vehicles are also buying EVs,” said Golchha. \nThe Sarlahi District Court on Monday sentenced Ram Bahadur Bomjan, a controversial ‘spiritual leader’, to 10 years in jail for child sex abuse.A single bench of Judge Jeevan Kumar Bhandari announced the jail term and also slapped a Rs500,000 fine for Bomjan, the court’s registrar Sadan Adhikari told the Post.The bench on June 24 convicted Bomjan and scheduled a hearing for Monday to determine the punishment.The court acquitted Bomjan’s two aides, Jit Bahadur Tamang and Gyan Bahadur Bomjan, in the same case.Bomjan, who was dubbed ‘Buddha Boy’ by some international media, is under judicial custody at Jaleshwar jail. On January 11, a bench of Judge Bishnu Prasad Regmi had sent him to judicial custody.A team from the Central Investigation Bureau of Nepal Police on January 9 arrested Bomjan from a house in Budhanilkantha, Kathmandu.Bomjan had been in hiding since the District Court, Sarlahi, on February 6, 2020, issued an arrest warrant against him as per a police request. In July 2020, a case of sexual abuse was filed against him in the District Court, Sarlahi.In the chargesheet, the District Attorney Office, Sarlahi, had demanded 12–15 years of prison for Bomjan and his two aides for their alleged involvement in the sexual exploitation of the minor.The chargesheet accuses Bomjan, the prime suspect, of raping a 15-year-old girl who was staying in his ashram (hermitage) at Pattharkot, Sarlahi, as an Ani (nun).Police in the chargesheet accused Bomjan of raping the minor by luring her to his private quarters at 9:20pm on August 4, 2016.He has further been charged with threatening the girl with consequences if she disclosed the incident to others.On February 23, 2020, after the victim turned 18, a complaint against him was registered at the District Police Office in Sarlahi.On June 18, 2020, a team from the CIB raided his ashram in ward 8 of Kamalamai Municipality in Sindhuli district but he was not found there. Police suspected he might have fled the place.Five families have filed complaints against him in different police offices, accusing him of murder, disappearance and sexual exploitation of his followers. The accusations regarding the disappearances of his followers are still awaiting trial.Bomjan shot to fame in 2005 after reportedly meditating for months without food, water, or sleep, leading the media to dub him the ‘Buddha Boy’. After emerging from his meditation, he and his followers set up ashrams in Bara, Sarlahi, Sindhupalchok and Sindhuli districts, where the abuses took place, the police said. \nOver the past five years, 449 individuals in Madhesh Province, Nepal, have died from electric shock incidents attributed to electrical negligence and careless use of electricity.\nParopakar Maternity and Women’s Hospital has emphasized the need for mental health screening training for all healthcare workers to address rising maternal deaths due to mental health issues during pregnancy.\nDespite being elected over a year ago, thematic committees in Nepal's Parliament lack momentum, hindering their oversight role and raising concerns about resource shortages and potential external influence.\nThe 2005 establishment of Aid for Trade (AfT) recognized the need for support to developing and least-developed countries in building trade capacity, with a focus on addressing trade-related constraints, particularly for LDCs.\nAs monsoons bring heavy rainfall in Nepal, the need for impact-based forecasting and anticipatory actions (AA) becomes crucial to mitigate disaster risks by providing early warnings and guiding timely responses.\nDespite federal mandates, the central government in Nepal maintains tight control over provinces, limiting their autonomy and hindering the establishment of their own police forces.\nIn the Copa America, Uruguay defeated the host US 1-0, eliminating them in the first round and advancing as group winners, while Panama qualified as runners-up in Group C.\nKey events unfold, shaping the narrative and revealing the characters' motivations and conflicts.\nTuesday's forecast predicts cloudy weather with rain, thunder, and lightning, including heavy rainfall in several provinces, and a risk of very heavy rainfall in some areas, with a generally cloudy night featuring light to moderate rainfall and chances of heavy rainfall in isolated locations.\nSiddhartha Art Gallery's exhibition of Patachitra, Bilampau, and Kalighat paintings explores the evolution of folk art, showcases the subversion of gender norms, and invites questions about the complexities and interpretations of feminism.\nIndia enacts new criminal laws replacing colonial-era legislation, replacing sedition law with sovereignty protection, prompting mixed reactions from government and opposition.\nNepalese police arrested 20 individuals, including foreigners, in connection with a 3,194 kg gold smuggling case worth $250 million, involving payment gateways and concealment in motorcycle brake pads and electronics.\nSeven Star International Travel and Tours launched their user-friendly online travel platform, www.esevenstar.com, on June 27th, granting customers access to their modern services and global reach.\nHouse of Representatives Speaker Devraj Ghimire recommended former government secretary Suresh Adhikari for the vacant secretary position after Padma Prasad Pandey's promotion to General Secretary.\nPolitical quotas and compromise have led to frequent and controversial ambassadorial recalls, with appointments made on the basis of loyalty rather than merit, hindering Nepal's diplomatic stability and consistency.\nOn March 15 last year, China reopened its borders for travel, ending a three-year closure during the Covid pandemic. As soon as the borders—land and air—opened, and the China-funded international airport in Pokhara was inaugurated, optimism was high. Before the pandemic, market insiders predicted a dramatic surge in Chinese tourists, who were Nepal’s second-largest source market after India before the Covid-19 pandemic. It didn’t happen. Nepal received 60,878 Chinese tourists in 2023, a recovery by a third from the pre-pandemic level when Chinese tourists boomed in Nepal.In the first five months (January–May) of this year, Nepal received 46,671 Chinese, with the highest arrival of 12,093 recorded in March. While Chinese arrivals slowed, Indian tourists boomed in Nepal, reaching an all-time high of 319,936 individuals, according to the Department of Immigration. Among Indians, only those who come by air are counted as tourists in Nepal. In the first five months, Nepal has received 148,861 Indian tourists, the highest number of 38,288 recorded in May. Before the pandemic, India and China were competing neck-to-neck. Now, there is a huge imbalance between the south and north.Will it change? On Monday, during the 16th round of the Nepal-China diplomatic consultation mechanism meeting held in Kathmandu, Beijing made a surprise announcement.It announced plans to promote Nepali tourism in China as part of celebrating 2025 as ‘Visit Nepal Year in China’, which Nepal’s top travel trade entrepreneurs say is a “big statement.” They say they had never before heard China favour any country with such soft power diplomacy.Will 2025 be the year for the potential great return of Chinese tourists then? “So far, I haven’t heard or seen Beijing promote any country’s tourism inside China. This is, in fact, a good gesture of neighbourliness,” said Kishore Raj Pandey, chairman of Saathi Nepal Travel and Tours, who was the first person to bring Chinese tourists to Nepal in 2001.“If it has been announced, Beijing indeed has some policy to encourage Chinese citizens to travel to Nepal.”Tourism is vital for Nepal’s economy. According to the recently released annual World Travel and Tourism Council research report, Nepal’s tourism sector generated Rs327.9 billion ($2.5 billion) in revenue and supported 1.19 million jobs directly and indirectly last year. The report forecasts that Nepal will generate 1.22 million jobs in 2024. Last year, the country received 1 million tourists.Some critics say it’s a lofty promise. Before Monday’s meeting, during the third Nepal Investment Summit held in Kathmandu on April 28, Luo Zhaohui, chairman of the China International Development Cooperation Agency, announced the waiver of visa fees for Nepalis.It was implemented on May 1. There was another announcement, too.“The Chinese government is making arrangements to start new flights from China to Nepal’s two new international airports—Pokhara and Lumbini,” Luo said while addressing the summit.Nepal’s $216 million international airport in Pokhara, the country’s tourism capital, opened in January last year. Beijing financed it.Similarly, Nepal’s second international airport in Bhairahawa, built by Chinese contractors, started operating in May 2022 after four years of construction delays. The objectives of both projects are to decentralise economic activities in the new federal setup, attract more tourists, and prevent Nepalis from going abroad.But only some international flights are operating in the two new shiny airports.“Under Beijing's renewed diplomacy, there is a possibility of the operation of these two new international airports,” said Basant Raj Mishra, a senior tourism entrepreneur. “Once flights from China come, it will create competition.”He said Beijing’s announcement represents a great opportunity for Nepal. “We should be prepared for joint marketing and promotional activities. With a proper policy, we can attract 1 million tourists from China alone in 2025. And for this, we need enhanced flight connectivity.”China is facing many economic obstacles, but Beijing remains optimistic about growth.Reports show that Chinese tourists hit the road in significant numbers during the recent five-day Labor holidays in May but kept a tight grip on their wallets, reflecting still-weak sentiment in the world’s second-largest economy.According to a statement from China’s Ministry of Culture and Tourism, travellers made 28.2 percent more trips, but spending only rose 13.5 percent from the 2019 break. “Of all the countries, China has the largest number of airlines connecting Nepal but brings the lowest number of tourists,” said Vijay Shrestha, vice president (Administration) at Himalaya Airlines, the Nepal-Tibet joint venture. There are five airlines currently connecting China. “The traffic is low,” said Shrestha. “It may be due to low consumer confidence.”Himalaya Airlines has suspended Kathmandu-Beijing flights, and Kathmandu-Shanghai flights are also irregular due to low passenger traffic. Besides, in the other three sectors, the average occupancy is 40 percent,” said Shrestha. “The announcement from Beijing to promote Nepal in China could change that.”Nepal and China established formal diplomatic relations in 1955, and Nepal-Tibet trade goes a long way back. In 1956, four cities of Tibet, namely Lhasa, Shigatse, Gyantse, and Yatung, were designated as major trading cities for Nepali traders.Between the founding of the People’s Republic of China in 1949 and 1982, few residents of China travelled to foreign destinations other than government officials, students, and a few businessmen. In 1983, China allowed citizens from Guangdong Province to travel to the British colony of Hong Kong on organised tours to visit family.Beginning in 1995, the Chinese National Tourism Administration formalised China’s Approved Destination Status (ADS) policy.The history of Chinese tourism in Nepal is not long either. Nepal first participated in the China International Travel Fair in 2000 to promote its tourism sector. Before 2000, the Chinese could only travel to Nepal on official visits.The Chinese government had permitted ADS for Chinese outbound travellers in November 2001. The two countries signed an initial memorandum of understanding on an implementation plan for outbound travel by Chinese people to Nepal on April 16, 2001, laying the groundwork for the ADS.Nepal was given the Approved Destination Status (ADS) by its northern neighbour in 2002, and in June of the same year, Chinese citizens began visiting Nepal officially for the first time as tourists. Nepal was the 18th nation to receive the status and first in South Asia. In 2002, Nepal got 8,715 Chinese tourists.Subsequently, the central banks of the two countries signed an agreement on bilateral cooperation that allowed the Chinese currency to be converted into Nepali rupees in a bid to boost bilateral trade, tourism, and economic cooperation.However, immediately after Nepal received the ADS, arrivals from China fell due to a violent conflict that intensified over 2002-2004, reaching Nepal’s main cities and tourist destinations. Nepal eventually started witnessing a constant growth in Chinese arrivals after June 2009.Chinese arrivals to Nepal crossed the 100,000 mark for the first time in 2013, mainly due to the improved air links between the two countries. According to the tourism ministry’s statistics, around 93 percent of Chinese tourists were first-time visitors to Nepal.In 2014, Nepal received 123,805 Chinese visitors.The 2015 earthquake and India's blockade led to arrivals from China dropping to a four-year low of 64,675 individuals in 2015, down 47.76 percent from 2014.The surface road at the Tatopani border point, where Nepal used to receive many Chinese tourists, was also blocked.On December 25, 2015, Nepal announced ‘free visa’ for Chinese tourists, giving them the same treatment accorded to South Asian visitors. In a bid to revive flagging arrivals, the scheme was implemented in January 2016.Thereon, tourist arrivals from China started rising steadily, and Nepal saw the strongest growth, 46.8 percent, in tourist arrivals from China, with the overall number reaching 153,633 visitors in 2018.In 2019, Nepal received a record 169,543 Chinese tourists.The number fell to 19,257 in 2020. In 2021 and 2022, there were 6,198 and 9,599 Chinese tourists in Nepal—mainly diplomats and those stranded in third countries—who came to Nepal when Beijing enforced never-ending lockdowns.When the Chinese economy started to boom again, Nepali investors pumped money into luxury hotels, which too have multiplied. \nLast month, a local from Sindhupalchowk district was brought to Sukraraj Tropical and Infectious Disease Hospital to treat a snakebite. Along with the victim, relatives brought the live snake in a bottle to show the doctor as proof.“The snake was a king cobra,” said Dr Yuba Nidhi Basaula, director at the Hospital. “Fortunately, the venom had not penetrated deep into the victim’s body, and after three days of treatment, the victim was discharged. We called a snake handler and handed over the king cobra.”Sindhupalchowk is a mountain district where venomous snakes were thought of as non-existent. However, incidents of king cobra bites in mountain districts like Sindhupalchowk suggest that venomous snakes have started migrating towards hill and mountain districts, and rising temperatures caused by climate change are the main culprit, experts say.Nepal is among the world’s most vulnerable countries to the climate crisis and has witnessed multiple extreme weather events over the past decade and a half.Evidence suggests that maximum temperatures in Nepal are rising at a faster rate of 0.056 degrees Celsius a year, compared to the global average rise of 0.03 degrees Celsius a year. Compared to districts of the Tarai region, those in hills and mountains have been witnessing a more rapid increase in daytime maximum temperatures, which could have helped venomous snakes survive there, experts say.“Not only in Sindhupalchowk, but a king cobra bite was also spotted in Godawari of Lalitpur district last year,” said Basaula. “Snakebite cases have started rising alarmingly of late.”Of the 31 patients admitted to the hospital on Sunday, 16—more than 50 percent—were snakebite cases. Doctors at the hospital say eight to ten snakebite victims seek treatment there every day, and most victims seeking care at the hospital are from the districts of Kathmandu Valley or from those adjoining the Valley.Each year, around 2,700 people, mostly children and women from Nepal’s Tarai region, die of snakebites, according to a March 2022 report published in The Lancet, a leading international medical journal.However, snakebite cases are vastly underreported in the country. The Ministry of Health and Population said that only 14 deaths and 1,220 cases of snakebites had been reported in 11 months of the current fiscal year. Officials admit that venomous snakebite incidents are being reported from hill and mountain districts, and the demand for anti-snake venom is on the rise. They attribute this rise in snakebite incidents to rising temperatures. “Health facilities in some mountainous and hilly districts—like Darchula and Bajura—have asked for anti-snake venom,” said Dr Hemanta Chandra Ojha, an official at the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division. “Snakebite incidents have been on the rise,” said Dr Hemanta Chandra Ojha, an official at the division. “With the onset of the monsoon, people living in the risk areas should remain vigilant.”Every year, the Health Ministry purchases around 25,000 vials of anti-snake venom and distributes them to around 100 snakebite treatment centres in the country.Officials say as snakebite cases surge, so will the demand for additional treatment centres. “This year, we are planning to set up an additional 15 snakebite treatment centres,” said Ojha. Public health experts have urged authorities to launch an awareness drive about the risks. They say people living in thatched-roof houses are particularly vulnerable to snakebites, as snakes often enter such homes in search of rats. They say people should be asked to keep their homes and surroundings clean, prevent children from playing in bushy areas, avoid venturing out at night, and use torchlights while walking in the dark.Likewise, women and children who have to work in fields and go to the jungle are at the highest risk of snakebites. Small children are at risk of dying from snakebites, as they do not tell their parents about the bites on time due to fear of getting scolded for playing in the bushes, according to doctors.“We should make people aware so that they seek medical attention immediately after a snakebite, using whatever means of transport they get,” said Ojha. “The faster you reach the hospital, the greater your chances of survival.” \nThe duel between Kathmandu’s 34-year-old mayor Balendra Shaha (popularly called Balen), a structural engineer, reputed rapper and political novice, and 72-year-old Khagda Prasad Sharma Oli, a high school dropout, two-time prime minister, political veteran and chairperson of the Communist Party of Nepal (United Marxist Leninist) is a caricature of contemporary Nepali politics marred by the conflict between the old and the young. The duel has attracted numerous newspaper articles, set social media on fire and provided YouTubers a field day. What is Oli’s motive in mobilising his whole party to attack Balen, and what is Balen—a lone man with no political experience and political following—doing picking a fight with Oli? How will the duel impact Oli’s party and Balen’s aspirations going forward? The fightThe Balen-Oli fight began when the metropolitan city started to clear buildings built illegally on municipal land or business advertisements that did not comply with municipal regulations. The city would order the current occupants of the offending buildings or business owners to comply with the law and vacate the premises. In most cases, the occupants would ignore the order. Like in old times, they relied on their political connections to continue to subvert the law. However, that did not work with Balen. He sent municipal forces to demolish the encroachment and non-compliant adverts. The first property subjected to the mayor's action belonged to someone connected to the UML. Soon after the clearance, a Central Committee member of the UML, Mahesh Basnet, called upon his minions to physically harm Balen if he did not “mend his ways”.Balen’s attempt to clean up Kathmandu from squatters occupying public land, particularly river banks, intensified the conflict. Oli publicly mocked Balen for using bulldozers to demolish plastic shades built by “poor squatters.” Some “squatters” are believed to occupy multistory buildings constructed on public land and own businesses worth millions of rupees. The majority of them are UML voters, “UMLs’ vote bank”, observed a Balen supporter. The squatter problem is not new. All previous governments, including the one led by Oli, recognised it. The conflict became increasingly acrimonious when Balen opened the basement of Dharahara for car parking. The government objected, arguing that the reconstruction of Dharahara is still incomplete and the car park is unsafe to use. Balen retorted, “Dharahara was inaugurated as a completed project by Prime Minister Oli before the last election. How can it be incomplete?” The inauguration of the work-in-progress was one of Prime Minister Oli’s pre-election charades. The car park is safe and currently in use; the reconstruction continues. The recent New Road imbroglio added fuel to the fire. Balen started widening the footpath on New Road to comply with the standards set by the Nepal Department of Roads (NDR). A local ward chair, a UML member, objected and complained to the Ministry of Physical Infrastructure and Transport headed by Deputy Prime Minister Ragubhir Mahaseth, an Oli acolyte. The NDR, which reports to Mahaseth, issued a “stop work” order. Incensed, Balen asked Oli to expeditiously arrange repayment for those who cheated the so-called Giri Bandhu Tea Estate land plotting scandal. Oli’s apparatchiks compared Balen to “a puppy” (a good-for-nothing weakling) and chastised him for maligning “our respected Chairman”. Oli himself has described Balen as a “bubble” which will fizzle out in no time. The fightersOli is old, witty, foxy, prickly, intolerant of criticism and, like all other politicians, corrupt in the public eye. As enunciated during his premiership, his vision of economic development includes building view towers, providing Kathmandu households with piped gas within six months, and building facilities for maritime trade—the latter two unachievable pipe dreams or political ploys. Balen is young, angry, ambitious, audacious, brash, bold, impulsive, focussed and untainted by corruption. His vision for Kathmandu is to make it a clean, functioning, beautiful heritage city. In about two years since he became mayor, Kathmandu has become relatively cleaner and greener. Its roads are rid of perpetual potholes; its sidewalks are walkable; teaching standards in public schools have improved; private schools who were short-changing on paying taxes have been forced to pay their share; emergency ambulance service has become more dependable, and so on. All of the above, despite a lack of support from political parties and the government. Parties do not support him because his success will spotlight their past failures. Despite the odds, his accomplishments have made him hugely popular throughout the country. “If we have ten leaders like Balen, we can change the country,” an exuberant Kathmandu taxi driver told me. Even the international press has taken note of Balen’s leadership. The New York Times published a story on Balen last year. He was named one of the 100 upcoming leaders in 2023 by the internationally known Time Magazine, published in the US. Balen’s public support is so visceral that he gets away even with outrageous comments like “burning Singha Durbar’, Nepal’s central secretariat, the office of Nepal’s Ministries, and irrelevant dragging of Oli into the “Giri Bandhu Tea Estate” scandal, and other similar outbursts. Although the overwhelming support for such comments on social media is surprising, it is indicative of the intensity of public dislike of established politicians.The future Balen knows that he owes his popularity as much to his performance as his refusal to bow down to political pressure and to stay clean from corruption scandals. In the two years since he assumed office, he has given confidence to the city dwellers that with exemplary leadership, the city and the country can be changed. His future depends on whether he can continue to ignore political pressure and demonstrate his perseverance, will, guts and vision to turn chaotic Kathmandu into a livable metropolis. As for Oli, UML lost the last election in Kathmandu because its mayor, a UML member, was a dismal failure. The confrontation with Balen for political upmanship and ego inflation will unlikely win Kathmandu for him. Cooperation may work better than confrontation.    \nRSP General Secretary Mukul Dhakal advocates for collaboration with independent forces like Balen Shah and Gopi Hamal, criticizing the incompatibility between new and traditional political forces in their positions on working together.\n**Summary:** Key events include battles, treaties, technological advancements, political changes, and cultural milestones.\n**Summarization:** [Key event 1] occurs, leading to [key event 2], ultimately resulting in [consequences or impact].\nSri Lanka, boasting rich culture, natural resources, and diverse experiences, is bouncing back from a financial crisis due to increased tourism.\nEducation in Every Home’s report titled ‘Diversity, Equity and Inclusion in Nepal’s Textbooks’ highlights the lack of diversity, inclusivity, and inaccuracies in these textbooks.  The findings include egregious mistakes in textbooks like the inclusion of a letter Abraham Lincloln supposedly wrote—dating to a time 17 years after his assassination, to assertions like Brazil has tigers, elephants and rhinos while Germany has tigers and monkeys. The books display a clear bias in favour of Brahmin Chhetri males, while women make up just 18 percent of all people profiled.

Sunita Dangol of the CPN-UML secured the position of KMC deputy mayor in the same election. When they began their term, many suspected that the two—an independent mayor and his party-affiliated deputy—wouldn’t have cordial relations. But, in the last two years of their term, there has been no visible disagreement between them. They proved their sceptics wrong.Deputy Mayor Dangol kept mum when Mayor Shah accused her party chair, KP Sharma Oli, of policy corruption in the Giri Bandhu Tea Estate land scam.Moreover, Shah expressed his anger on June 3 over the government’s intervention in his plan to widen pavements in the New Road area. Deputy Prime Minister Raghubir Mahaseth of the UML leads the Ministry of Physical Infrastructure and Transport, which maintains major roads.After the ministry intervened in the municipal plan to expand the sidewalk on New Road, Shah took to social media and wrote, “Honourable KP Oli jyu, don’t hoodwink people by engineering yet another scam to hide a scam of Rs10,000 crore [Rs100 billion].”He further added, “You have reassured those who had made advance payments to buy land of Giri Bandhu Tea Estate that they would get the land within two years.” “If one looks at the policy corruption in the tea estate, it appears not a single leaf would stir without Oli’s nod,” Shah wrote.A few days prior to the incident, Mayor Shah had engaged in a heated debate with Chinkaji Maharjan, a UML member and chairman of KMC’s ward 22, over the sidewalk expansion plan.Dangol remained quiet on the issue thus far. However, at the city council meeting on Monday, which also discussed KMC's policies and programmes for the fiscal year 2024-25, she criticised Mayor Shah for his remarks.“This should be the first time the deputy mayor opposed the public behavior and statement of the mayor,” a Kathmandu ward chairperson told the Post on the condition of anonymity.Dangol had her initial plan to contest the mayor position independently but the UML gave her the deputy mayor’s ticket.Speaking during the Monday discussion, Deputy Mayor Dangol said, addressing Mayor Shah, “Your and mine voices are being heard and watched by Nepalis worldwide. Therefore, those of us who want to come to politics should think about our expression,” Dangol remarked. “We should maintain the image and dignity of the institution we represent.”She also emphasised the need to accommodate the voices of everyone in an undertaking.Though the representatives of Kathmandu Metropolitan City claim that Dangol's Monday statement was unusual, they deny any rift between the two leaders of the local government. “City council’s is an internal meeting of the KMC where various issues arise. We settle those issues internally,” Nabin Manandhar, the KMC spokesperson and ward 17 chairman from the Nepali Congress, told the Post. “Having an opinion does not necessarily mean criticism.”Rajesh Kumar Shrestha, chair of KMC ward 19, seconded Manandhar.However, local representatives of Kathmandu have been questioning Shah for his ‘lone-wolf’ manner of leading the institution.“We should develop a working relationship that welcomes everyone’s spirit,” Dangol told the council meeting. “If one thinks they are in a position and everything should be done as they say, it will only lead to trouble.”She added, “While working in a team, we definitely have a different opinion, but different opinions should be respected.”At the meeting, referring to Mayor Shah's past statements, council member Anita Karki asked him, saying, “What if the voters of Kathmandu set ablaze the Durbar where the KMC office lies?”In September last year, when the traffic police obstructed a KMC vehicle, later known to be used by his postpartum wife, Mayor Shah provocatively wrote on Facebook, threatening to burn Singha Durbar, the federal government’s central secretariat.Traffic police, under the federal government, had stopped the vehicle to check necessary documents on a Saturday.After the incident, Shah wrote on social media warning that if the government blocked KMC's vehicles again, he would set fire to Singha Durbar.Dangol said on Monday that she believed it was wrong to write on social media or make a statement inciting people to burn the Singha Durbar or the Bagh Durbar, where the KMC office is situated.Dangol, speaking at the city council meeting, also said there should be no polarisation between the representatives who were elected to develop Kathmandu. \nA police officer, Ajit Gole, was found dead by suicide from a gunshot wound in the federal parliament building's washroom.\nPolice in Nepal arrested two individuals in Thimi for alleged cryptocurrency mining using a CTEVT lab with 64 desktops and a server, and blockchain applications were discovered during an initial investigation.\nHeavy monsoon rains, floods, and landslides have disrupted the supply chain, causing a steep rise in vegetable prices in the Kathmandu valley, making daily essentials like ginger, green chillies, tomatoes, and potatoes unaffordable for many.\nDespite official claims of national road connectivity, Simkot, Humla, remains isolated due to the lack of a bridge over the Karnali river, resulting in transportation difficulties, high costs, and inflated commodity prices in the district.\nNepal Airlines faces difficulty selling six grounded Chinese aircraft despite multiple auctions with no bids, leading to a potential scrap value sale but the airline remains hopeful for a successful third attempt.\nNeighboring India's Zika outbreak and Nepal's dengue outbreak raise concerns due to shared vectors, posing a high risk for a Zika outbreak in Nepal, as the virus can cause severe birth defects and neurological problems.\nIn June last year, a measles outbreak was reported in Kathmandu’s Gokarneshwar Municipality. Along with Kathmandu of Bagmati Province, the outbreak of the deadly disease was reported in several districts of Lumbini, Karnali, Sudurpaschim, Koshi, and Madhesh provinces.And in less than a year of that outbreak, health authorities concerned have been gearing up to declare the entire Madhesh Province fully immunised.“We are all prepared to declare the Madhesh Province fully immunised,” said Dr Abhiyan Gautam, chief of the Immunisation Section at the Family Welfare Division under the Department of Health Services. “All the districts of Madhesh Province have been already declared fully covered, and we have decided to declare the province fully immunised.”To declare an area as fully immunised, all children under 15 months old residing there must be administered all vaccines of the routine immunisation programme.Child health experts doubt the claim that all eligible children of the Madhesh Province have been administered the routine vaccines. They say the decision to declare a fully immunised province could raise a sense of complacency in the public, which will ultimately backfire.“Most of the districts across the country have already been declared fully immunised, and the fact is outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases, including measles, keep getting reported,” said Dr Shyam Raj Upreti, former director general at the Department of Health Services. “Declaration of a fully immunised province could create a sense of complacency in the public. We also declared the entire country open-defecation-free years ago, but outbreaks of waterborne diseases, including diarrhoea and cholera, have not stopped.”Experts say many districts across the country have already been declared fully literate but it’s hard to believe that all the districts are indeed fully literate.“For the last four months, we have been launching extensive vaccination programmes to achieve the target of a fully immunised province,” said Dr Rajiv Jha, chief of the Provincial Health Directorate of Madhesh Province. “We have also carried out the survey and found 100 percent of children between 15 to 23 months are immunised.”Experts, however, say it is impossible to achieve fully immunised status, as babies are born every hour and every day. Coverage of most health programmes is low in Madhesh Province compared to districts of other provinces. People of certain communities go to maternal homes for child delivery and return months after, and the risk of missing the routine vaccination is high there, according to them.Vaccine coverage is low among people living along the Nepal-India border who keep travelling to India frequently. Most of them opt out of vaccine programmes run by both Nepal and India. Health experts say low vaccination coverage, internal migration, a lack of awareness of importance of vaccines, and government apathy are among the reasons for regular outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases.“Due to cross border movements, the trend to go to maternal homes for child delivery, lack of awareness about the importance of vaccination and hygiene and sanitation conditions, risk of children missing routine vaccines is high in Madhesh Province,” said Upreti. “More than the declaration of full immunisation, sustaining that status is very crucial. Childhood vaccination is a continuous process, which never ends, meaning that the target is never achieved.”The Nepal Demographic and Health Survey-2022, carried out by the Ministry of Health and Population, showed that at least four percent of children aged 12 to 23 months have received no vaccination.The number of children missing basic antigens in the routine immunisation programme in Madhesh Province was also staggering. According to the report, the immunisation coverage rate in Madhesh Province is only 68 percent, which means 32 percent of children in the province didn’t take all the vaccines. It is the lowest of all the seven provinces.The government provides 13 types of vaccines through the national immunisation programme. Gandaki Province has a 93 percent vaccine coverage rate, the highest in the country. The vaccine coverage in Sudurpaschim Province, which is considered less developed and less educated, is 89 percent.The vaccination coverage rate is 81 percent in Koshi, 83 percent in Bagmati, 85 percent in Lumbini, and 84 percent in Karnali Province.Immunisation is considered the most cost-effective and efficient way to control and eliminate vaccine-preventable diseases that contribute to childhood illnesses and deaths. \nAt least 1,072 people from across the country have been infected with A(H1N1), also known as the swine flu virus, since January, this year.Data provided by the National Public Health Laboratory shows that 373 others were infected with the influenza B virus, 75 with the A (H3) virus, also known as Hong Kong Flu, 13 with co-infection of swine flu and coronavirus, and two with co-infection of influenza B and coronavirus. What concerns public virologists and infectious disease experts in Nepal is that less than one-fifth of cases of influenza-like illnesses are diagnosed, and neither the doctors attending patients nor the authorities concerned bother to know the real cause of ailments. They say that of the swab samples of 8,739 people with an influenza-like illness, only 1,743 tested positive for various kinds of influenza. “The cause of ailments of the rest of people are not known, which should be a cause of serious concern to the researchers as well as policymakers,” said Dr Sher Bahadur Pun, chief of the Clinical Research Unit at Sukraraj Tropical and Infectious Disease Hospital. “The criteria for collecting the swab samples for influenza test is that patients should have an influenza-like illness, but only less than one-fifth of samples are testing positive for influenza.”The laboratory only maintains a record of the positive cases but does not tell anything about fatalities due to infections. Experts say the number of people infected with influenza could be several times higher than the data provided by the laboratory, as many people suffering from influenza-like illness do not seek treatment. Even for those who do seek treatment, in most cases, the underlying cause of their ailments often remains undiagnosed. “The next pandemic could also be a pandemic of respiratory viruses,” said Pun. “We will not be able to lessen the risk of outbreaks in future if we continue ignoring the risks. Authorities must step up surveillance and investigate the underlying causes of these ailments.”A recent report by the Nepal Statistics Office also shows that cold and fever remain a significant concern, with an increase from 43.7 percent in 1995/96 to 51. 5 percent in 2022/23.Doctors say more people get infected with viruses during the seasonal changes, as most viruses—adenovirus, rhinovirus, influenza virus, and even coronavirus—become active during these times and winter.But this does not mean respiratory viruses do not spread at other times. “People are getting continuously infected with respiratory viruses in other seasons as well. Those with weak immunity could become more severely affected by the infection,” said Dr Raju Pangeni, a pulmonologist. “Besides urging people to take precautions against these risks, authorities must step up surveillance measures to know the real causes of influenza-like illnesses.”As very few people in Nepal receive flu shots. Experts say unvaccinated elderly people and those with compromised immunity are at risk of severe respiratory virus infections.Doctors say the influenza virus causes respiratory complications, which affect the lungs. It quickly spreads in communities. The diseases can cause fever, cough, body aches, occasional vomiting, diarrhoea and pneumonia.They say that early diagnosis is crucial for preventing infection. Patients recover quickly if treated on time. Both the severity of the disease and the number of deaths increase if seasonal influenza cases are not diagnosed on time, according to experts. \nNineteen-year-old Ekta suffers from excruciating pain during her periods. It is far beyond the usual pain and cannot be managed with medication–she’s tried that multiple times. Taking one dose of Meftal (a period pain medication) is never enough. The pain is debilitating most of the time.Despite several visits to gynaecologists, her complaints have been brushed aside as normal period pains. She strongly feels that her pain is abnormal, but feels powerless to address her issues.“The pain is so bad, but I cannot do anything about it,” she says. “I can’t count the number of times that I’ve been told that my debilitating pain is normal,” bemoans Ekta, whose name has been changed to protect her privacy.The normalisation of period pains means serious reproductive conditions like endometriosis often go untreated. People with endometriosis experience severe pelvic pain because tissues like that found outside the uterus grow inside it. Other symptoms of the condition include heavy bleeding during and between periods and fatigue. There is no known cure for this condition, and symptoms can start from the first period onwards.A major challenge experienced by women with endometriosis is the disregard of their symptoms by the public and medical professionals alike. Due to lack of awareness about the debilitating pain typical to endometriosis, both the person suffering from the condition, and their doctors often underestimate their severity.Severe pelvic pain is a key indicator for diagnosing endometriosis, says Dr Reena Shrestha, a gynaecologist at Madhyapur Hospital. When patients seek consultation regarding the kind of severe pain that significantly disrupts their lives, they may undergo two types of tests: transvaginal ultrasound and diagnostic laparoscopy. These procedures are used to determine the presence of endometriosis. Endometriosis is a complex condition, says Dr Hema Pradhan, a consultant gynaecologist at Everest Hospital. Amongst all the patients she meets at her consultations, many frequently turn out to have endometriosis. But, she’s noticed that often patients often delay seeking treatment because period pains are often normalised.“Women who come to me with their symptoms often delay seeking treatment, because, regardless of the severity of their pain, they believe all period pains to be normal,” says Pradhan.Eighteen-year-old Rima (name change) has been struggling with excessive pain before and during periods for years. She also experiences pain while urinating during her periods. Rima has also been diagnosed with Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome (PCOS). The co-occurence of PCOS and endometriosis is not unheard of, although research on them has been minimal.“I can barely walk when I’m on my periods, but I’ve always been told that I should just learn to live with it,” she says.Despite knowing about PCOS, she discovered the possibility of having endometriosis quite later in life. She shares this because period pain, even excessive ones, have been normalised for far too long.The general lack of awareness of endometriosis, and widespread normalisation of period pains, often results in late diagnosis and treatment of the condition.Although there may be no cure to the condition, there are ways to manage its most severe symptoms. Furthermore, receiving a diagnosis can greatly help patients to understand the severity of their condition, according to doctors. “I’m incapable of doing anything during my periods. One time I had to leave the examination in the middle of my exams because of the pain,” says Ekta. “I can’t study, can’t work, all I can do is stay in bed and cry,” she adds.Dr Pradhan reveals another challenging aspect of diagnosing endometriosis. Sometimes the condition may not appear on ultrasound scans initially. Endometrial deposits may appear differently in women due to hormonal changes. Furthermore, symptoms may vary, with some being asymptomatic altogether. According to Dr Shrestha, once a gynaecologist confirms that the patient has endometriosis, they will certainly recommend methods to manage the pain. These include analgesics for pain relief, and home remedies like hot water bag massage.However, the main problem remains. Due to lack of awareness, most patients may only find out about their condition later in life.In some cases women only discover they have endometriosis when they face infertility. Endometriosis is associated with infertility, and 30-50% of people with endometriosis may experience infertility. This also exposes another troubling aspect associated with endometriosis. Ekta shares that her relatives often express concerns about her potential infertility.“They just make me feel bad that I might never get pregnant. And it makes me feel worse,” Ekta adds.Worldwide, endometriosis has been known as a scientifically under-researched condition. It has even been called the ‘missed disease’ because of inconsistencies in its diagnosis and treatment. Endometriosis has also been widely ignored by policy makers.Treatment for endometriosis depends on the individual, says Dr Pradhan. Some are treated with hormonal medication, and others require surgical procedures. The main way to combat endometriosis is timely diagnosis, and timely treatment, she adds.“Raising awareness, timely diagnosis, and treatment are very important,” Dr Pradhan says. \nI can vividly remember my first encounter with baking when I was 10 years old. We had just moved to our new home and got a cable connection. The cable opened a world of possibilities, as it gave me access to various contents.This was back in the late 2000s when YouTube would take hours to load, taunting us with its buffering screen. I was particularly drawn to travel and lifestyle channels, mainly TLC, Fox Life, and Food Network, which kept me informed about different foods and cultures. I don’t know why, but I was always drawn to desserts. It was fascinating to see how these miraculous treats made people smile at the end of the meal.Growing up in Nepal, I noticed that baking wasn't very common. While some families did have ovens, they were mostly multifunctional ones used primarily for heating food.I also noticed that most of our desserts didn't require an oven, as they could be made on a stovetop. So, you can imagine my excitement when my mom decided to buy an oven during one of her festive shopping sprees.I could finally feel the joy these channels portrayed. (I blame food writer Nigella Lawson for getting me hooked on a domestic lifestyle.) Then, one day, after watching one of the cooking episodes on television, I finally mustered enough strength and decided to bake something. I distinctly remember wanting to make a chocolate cake for myself after watching one of Rachel Allen’s bake series. I watched all the ingredients used in that recipe and scurried across my pantry, only to realise I didn’t have half of the stuff she mentioned. I then decided to improvise the recipe (a big mistake). I randomly combined the ingredients that I had in a mixing bowl and chucked the batter into my oven, hoping for a magical cake to pop out an hour later.After I saw the result an hour later, I was mortified. The cake was stuck in the pan, refusing to come out, and it was as dense as fudge. I convinced myself that the taste was what mattered most, but when I served a slice to my brother, he made a face of utter disgust.That was the day I realised that baking soda was not the same as baking powder.After this incident, I researched baking and found out it was technical. This was a blessing in disguise for me, as I loved science, and I started to view baking as a science experiment. I then reflected and evaluated how to perfect one's baking skills.I analysed my errors and noted down all the steps I did every time I baked. Home baking is a passion for many. The idea of turning a few simple ingredients into a delicious masterpiece is as enchanting as it sounds.Yet, for many of us, this seemingly magical process can often turn into a series of unfortunate events, leading to crumbled dreams and deflated ambitions. Dense cakes, burnt crusts, rock-hard cookies and unrisen bread, if you are an amateur baker, then you have seen it all. But why do these mishaps happen so often? And most importantly how do we overcome them?From my experience, behind every successful bake lies a series of challenges and mishaps that test even the most dedicated bakers. Baking has its own set of rules that you need to follow to get that scrumptious treat every time. So, to transform a recipe into an actual dish that will impress your friends and family, I am sharing with you some of the tips and tricks I learned from my tumultuous journey as a home baker.First things first, we have to look into the prime appliance that we are working with. Commercial ovens are of two types: one that runs on gas and the other that runs on electricity. We have to look at the oven present at our home and consider its pros and cons. The main benefits of a gas oven are its size and temperature control. One can quickly change the temperature just by twisting the knob, and it preheats much more quickly than an electric one. However, they are known to have uneven temperatures at times and release more humidity, making it harder to properly crisp or brown food. This can result in burnt edges and cold or hot spots. An electric oven, on the other hand, provides more even and consistent temperatures and doesn’t release as much moisture in the air.This dry oven environment makes it easier to brown your items, making it great for baking bread. However, while the dry oven results in more even cooking, you also run the risk of drying out cakes and other baked goods.Also, many people forget to preheat the oven before baking, which is crucial for maintaining an even temperature throughout the baking process. When baking cakes and bread, I like to place a small tray of water at the bottom of the oven to provide moisture and prevent the baked goods from drying out.An oven thermometer can be a baker's best friend, providing a true reading and ensuring your creations bake evenly. I also like rotating the pan midway while baking, as it allows for an even distribution of heat.The next thing people mess up on is measuring and the specificity of ingredients in a recipe. Our moms made our food with their instinct; it is something that they learned along the way, but when you are baking, you cannot instinctively add or omit a few steps.I think that is why we initially had problems with baking. In a culture where cooking comes instinctually, baking challenges us, to be precise. A gram of more or less of any ingredient can drastically alter the outcome. Different methods of measuring flour can yield different results.Every component in baking serves a distinct purpose and function. Flour offers structure, sugar adds sweetness and moisture, eggs bind things together, and butter enhances taste and texture. However, not all ingredients are created equally. For example, using salted butter instead of unsalted might change the taste profile of your meal.Similarly, different flours have varying protein concentrations, which affect the texture of baked goods. The type of sugar used also makes a difference. Granulated sugar, brown sugar, powdered sugar, and speciality sugars like turbinado or muscovado each add unique flavours to a bake.Understanding these nuances and how they interact is critical for getting the intended outcomes. Accurate measurement tools and techniques are essential, but mastering them can be a steep learning curve. So, I would recommend investing in a kitchen scale that allows for more accurate measurements by weight rather than volume.Moving on, leavening agents such as baking soda, baking powder, and yeast are required to make baked goods rise. However, they can also cause confusion and errors. Baking soda needs an acidic component to activate, but baking powder has both an acid and a base, making it self-activating.Using the wrong type of flour or sugar, or using them in incorrect proportions, can result in flat, overly raised, or collapsed cakes. Yeast, being a living organism, presents its challenges.The water temperature must be just right—not too hot to kill the yeast, nor too cold to inhibit its activity. Proofing times and conditions also need to be carefully managed to achieve the perfect rise.Bakers should also be careful about the way they mix ingredients. The method of mixing ingredients can significantly impact the final product. Over-mixing can develop too much gluten in cakes and pastries, leading to tough textures.Under-mixing can leave pockets of unincorporated ingredients, resulting in uneven bakes. Techniques like folding, creaming, and whipping each serve specific purposes and must be executed with care.Finally, home bakers must understand the importance of timing and patience in baking. Even a minute or two can make the difference between perfectly baked cookies and burnt edges.Recipes often provide a range for baking times, but factors like oven hot spots, pan material, and altitude can affect these times. It’s crucial to keep a close eye on your bakes and rely on visual and tactile cues, such as a cake pulling away from the sides of the pan or a toothpick coming out clean, to determine doneness.Baking is also an exercise in patience, a virtue not everyone possesses. Doughs need time to rest and rise, flavours need time to meld, and baked goods need time to cool before they can be enjoyed.Impatience can lead to underbaked centres, crumbling slices, and a general sense of frustration. Cultivating patience is as important as mastering any technique in the baker’s repertoire.Home baking is a journey full of ups and downs, but it comes with great rewards. The obstacles encountered teach valuable lessons in patience, precision, and perseverance.The satisfaction of success, the freedom to create, and the therapeutic benefits make the endeavour meaningful. Whether baking for oneself, loved ones, or as an artistic outlet, the journey is as fulfilling as the result. Embrace the flour-dusted countertops, occasional setbacks, and the joys of home bakingFor a beginner-friendly recipe that involves mixing ingredients and delivers amazing results, try my recipe for fudgy, nutty brownies that I call ‘Bliss Brownies’.Bliss Brownies150g unsalted butter plus extra for the tin150g chopped dark chocolate200g caster sugar½ tsp baking powder2 eggs80g cocoa powder150g plain flour70g mixture of nuts (walnuts and almonds)60g blended papayaMix all the ingredients (except the dark chocolate and nuts) in a blender or a food processor and blitz till you get a smooth paste.Fold the chocolate and the nuts into the brownie batter, making sure that the pieces are evenly mixed in.Grease a loaf pan with soft butter and dust with cocoa powder. Pour the batter into the loaf pan.Bake in a preheated oven at 170c for 40 minutes and let it cool in the oven for an hour. Enjoy with a cup of coffee or, as I like it, a scoop of vanilla ice cream. \nIn a world where acceptance and safety often seem difficult to attain, many queer individuals also struggle to find a safe space to express themselves. They have to hide their true self and face relentless judgement when going to public places like cafes and restaurants.This is the reality for countless LGBTQIA+ individuals. The need for a safe space for this community is not just a desire but a necessity—a space where one can be themselves. This struggle for safety and acceptance can be traced to crucial historical moments, such as the Stonewall Riots of 1969 in New York City.The Stonewall Inn was more than a bar; it was a refuge for the queer community. When police raided the bar, the community fought back. This series of violent confrontations, which began in the early hours of June 28, 1969, between police and gay rights activists, marked the beginning of the modern LGBTQIA+ rights movement. The spirit of Stonewall, the fight for dignity and the right to exist openly lives on in places like Inclusive Galaxy Restaurant in Kathmandu. Inclusive Galaxy beyond a restaurant is an ‘oasis’ for the queer community and beyond.Founded by Bishwaraj Adhikari, Mr Gay Handsome Nepal 2013, a human rights defender, the restaurant proves the power of safe spaces. It’s a place where the community can unite, free from the prejudice and hostility that often permeate their everyday lives.After years of working in the human rights sector, Adhikari and his partner developed the idea for Inclusive Galaxy. What began as a small cafe gradually evolved into a full-fledged restaurant, driven by the growing demand and support from the community.“In developed countries with strong LGBTQIA+ movements, you can find community areas like gay villages. These are created as safe spaces for people whose families and communities have excluded them. They also support new business ideas and pink tourism. I hope to see pink tourism develop in Nepal someday,” says Adhikari. His vision for Inclusive Galaxy goes beyond just being a restaurant. He aims to promote financial independence and empowerment within the queer community.Since its inception in February 2019, Inclusive Galaxy has become a key spot for many in Lazimpat, a relatively queer-friendly area in Kathmandu. The location is essential because the first LGBTQIA+ movement in Nepal started in 2001 through the Blue Diamond Society.Inclusive Galaxy, true to its name, welcomes everyone—queer and non-queer alike—to share a comfortable space. His vision was clear: to create a space where people of all genders and sexual identities could come together without fear of exclusion.“I didn’t want to make it exclusively for queer people because that would be excluding ourselves from society. Different groups need to live together and understand each other,” Adhikari explains.In the early days, the cafe attracted both queer and non-queer customers. However, when some of the residents learned about Adhikari’s identity and the nature of the clientele, there was a brief period of hesitation. “At first, I didn’t understand what was happening, but then I realised my identity was an issue for a few people. I believe people should be judged by others by their character, not by their gender or sexuality. Over time, as residents saw that we operated like any other cafe, they became more comfortable,” Adhikari reflects.Adhikari started Inclusive Galaxy to give queer individuals a place to be proud of themselves, counteracting the self-doubt and insecurity that hiding one’s identity can cause. This turned the cafe very quickly into a community hub. The journey was not without challenges, though. It was difficult to hire staff and cooks from the LGBTQIA+ community, and soon after the restaurant opened, the COVID pandemic made things even harder.Despite these difficulties, the doors of Inclusive Galaxy remained open. During the pandemic, many queer individuals, who were abandoned by their families or afraid to return home, found comfort at Inclusive Galaxy.Since many couldn’t afford to pay for meals, the restaurant provided free food from its resources. As the number of people needing meals grew to 20-30 daily, Adhikari started raising funds within the community.“During my time as an activist, many people came here not only for food but also to see an organisation where the queer community supports one another,” Adhikari says.“The time during COVID was difficult, but it brought me closer to the community.”Four years after its inception, the restaurant has garnered a loyal following. Sarosy Neupane, Miss Pink Nepal 2024 first runner-up, describes Inclusive Galaxy as her second home. She moved to Kathmandu to study in 2022. Being distant from her family, she started visiting Galaxy for meals that reminded her of home-cooked food. Over time, she grew attached to the café because of its welcoming atmosphere.“It’s heartwarming to see people from our community and different walks of life here. The founders even invite us to festivals like ‘Dahi Chiura Khane din,’” she shares.Neupane visits the cafe regularly and sometimes stays until 3 am, engrossed in conversations. “I hope more spaces like this can open in the future. If, unfortunately, this place were to close someday, I don’t think we’d have any other place to turn to,” she adds.Muna Chhetri, a trans woman who has been a loyal customer for three years, shares, “This is my safe space where I can truly be myself. I always feel judged in other restaurants, but that fear doesn’t exist here. It’s where even those who aren’t accepted at home can feel accepted.”Sahara Khadka Chhetri, owner of Pink Tiffany, Kathmandu’s first openly LGBTIQIA+ friendly restaurant and bar, frequently visits after managing the bar, appreciating the convenience of not cooking at home.She notes very few places like this cater to our community, and some even had to close during COVID. “As an entrepreneur, I know that sustaining these spaces is a challenge. But as more spaces like these open, they will make the way for a more inclusive and compassionate society.”The welcoming atmosphere at Inclusive Galaxy has also had a surprising effect on non-queer patrons. Samriddha Jung Rana, a twenty-year-old neighbour who identifies as straight, often visits the café and appreciates the importance of such spaces.“Previously, I didn’t know much about the queer community and didn’t care much. But now, coming into this café, I’ve been interested in their rights and issues. I’ve realised that we’re not so different after all. We are all human,” he remarks.The ventures like Inclusive Galaxy and Pink Tiffany have inspired hope for collaborative businesses between queer and non-queer groups. The recent initiative by the Nepal Tourism Board promoting Pink Tourism in April 2024 is a positive step. Still, Adhikari believes that more support is needed from the government and the private sector.Despite the progress, challenges remain. However, Adhikari remains optimistic about the future. He is working on plans to develop the restaurant into a homestay program in the future.“Like how different planets, asteroids, and stars make up a beautiful galaxy, people from all walks of life and identities make a beautiful society. I am happy that we are assimilating together in this space. We are not so different; we are all different and similar simultaneously,” he says. \nAditya Mishra is a Nepali chef and entrepreneur based in New York. Passionate about elevating Nepali cuisine globally, Mishra sharpened his culinary skills while staging at various Michelin-starred restaurants in the city during his time at culinary school. A recipient of the James Beard Foundation National Scholars Scholarship in 2023, Mishra’s early experiences inspired him to establish his own supper club, ‘The Sewing Tin’, alongside co-founder Akhil Upad.In an interview with Post’s Aarati Ray, Mishra discusses his restaurant in New York, serving Nepali cuisines there and the recipe for his signature dish.How did your cooking journey start in New York?At 14, I told my parents I wanted to be a chef, but they preferred I pursue a stable career like engineering, as many Nepali families do. So, I left for Louisiana in 2019 to study engineering.But, cooking never left my heart so, after a year, I left engineering college and moved to New York City. It’s been three and a half years and my parents only learned about it later. When my mom visited me in NYC and saw my dedication to cooking, she saw my passion and supported my decision.What sparked your interest in cooking from a young age?As a child, I was drawn to cooking shows on TLC. The glamour of cooking, eating, travelling and the prosperity of famous chefs was fascinating.Around age 16, I discovered Chef Anthony Bourdain’s groundbreaking book, ‘Kitchen Confidential’, which shed light on the reality of the culinary industry. I learned how he became a cultural icon in NYC, reshaping perceptions of chefs.I was also fascinated by chefs like Marco Pierre White, who was a mentor to Gordon Ramsay. Their stories of achieving fame while maintaining discipline intrigued me. But, as I grew older and entered the culinary world, I realised it was far from glamorous—it involved dedication and I am glad I persevered.How did the idea for The Sewing Tin originate?The concept of ‘The Sewing Tin’ came when I realised the stark contrast between the romanticised view of kitchen work and its harsh reality. Witnessing the struggles of many kitchen staff—economic hardships, immigration challenges and language barriers—I had to rediscover my love for cooking.During my internship at ‘Junoon’ restaurant, I met my co-founder, Akhil Upad, who shared my culinary enthusiasm despite his preparations for medical college. Together, we wanted to create a dining experience that was more personal and communal, offering fine dining with a sense of community.We wanted our food to tell stories, so we named our restaurant ‘The Sewing Tin’ inspired by the immigrant experience in NYC. When immigrants opened cookie boxes as kids, they often found sewing supplies instead of food.‘The Sewing Tin’ is like opening a cookie box and finding sewing supplies—something uniquely desi, or South Asian. How do you promote Nepali cuisine in New York City through The Sewing Tin?My partner is from Atlanta with Indian roots, while I come from Nepal, so our menu celebrates and reflects both cultures and heritage.We represent our respective cultures authentically. For example, we have a dish inspired by Newari cuisine called kachaila, similar to French Tartar. We present it as Tartar to make it accessible to our customers but infuse it with Nepali flavours, telling stories about its origins and giving diners a taste of my homeland.What do you think of the prospects of Nepali cuisine abroad?I’m on a mission to share Nepali food worldwide. I have served up dishes like chatamari and lamb sekuwa in my restaurant. But I’m still learning and want to explore more of Nepal’s cuisines. My big dream? To make Nepali cuisine reach more places because it’s got something special that can wow taste buds everywhere.How do you see the changes in restaurants in Nepal?The restaurant industry has deep roots in community and bringing people together, dating back centuries. While this core idea remains, modern restaurants have evolved, making changes to adapt to the times.Yet, in Nepal, despite the growing number of restaurants, many lack uniqueness and storytelling, focusing more on making money than fostering a sense of community.I’ve noticed a troubling trend of rising prices, especially for beloved dishes like momos, which makes people question if they're getting value for their money. It seems like profits are taking precedence over creating genuine, authentic culinary experiences.The industry is starting to lose the creativity and passion that once made it special. It might be time for chefs to shake things up, challenge the norm and bring fresh ideas to the table, revitalising the culinary scene with renewed energy and creativity.What challenges have you faced in New York as an outsider?Living in a bustling city like New York as an outsider has its challenges. But, this city is also full of opportunities for those who are passionate. If you stay true to your culture and want to share your story, opportunities are waiting for you.Even though it can be daunting because of the tough competition, the city appreciates determination and expertise. When I started my journey here, all I wanted to do was cook, eat and share the story of Nepal and its diverse cultures. Instead of focusing on the difficulties, I embraced the chance to follow my passion.What do you think about the criticism of blending Nepali food with modern culinary styles?Chefs care about their food—it’s like they’re sharing a story. They’ve put in a lot of effort to become skilled, so let them be creative. It’s okay to give helpful advice but don’t be mean just to criticise. Chefs shouldn’t also just copy what’s popular, they should cook what they truly love. That’s what makes food special and meaningful.Mishra’s signature dish:Confit Duck Chatamari A traditional Nepali delicacy with French influence.Ingredients:Duck (Legs and breast)Rice (soaked overnight)MayonnaiseWhole spices (cloves, cinnamon, cardamom, bay leaf)Red onionGarlicGingerMula ko achar (Fermented radish)ScallionsLemon juiceNepali pepperVinegarSaltSugarProcedure:For the Duck:Season duck with salt and pepper.Cook in a covered pan with whole spices, garlic, and ginger at low heat for 2 hours on a stove (270 degrees in the oven)Increase heat to crisp up the skin (approximately 15 minutes).Shred the duck meat.Confit Garlic Aioli:Mash cooked garlic and ginger and mix with mayonnaise, lemon juice, Nepali pepper and fermented radishes.Pickled Onions:Slice onions and cook in a mixture of vinegar, water, salt, sugar, and whole spices until softened (about 10 minutes).For the chatamari:Blend soaked rice to make a batter, let it ferment for 6 hours, and adjust consistency with water.Assembling:Cook chatamari batter in duck fat for 4 minutes.Top with shredded duck, aioli, pickled onions and scallions.Serve \nCeleus Baral exudes a serene aura when you meet her, and when she tells you she bakes, it makes sense. Even during a brief encounter, you can tell she has the patience needed to be a baker.“You can eyeball cooking, but baking is chemistry. You have to be meticulous. You cannot rush it, or it does not turn out as expected,” says the 21-year-old environment science student. She also runs the online baking shop Bakeleus. Recently, she has also started selling her baked goods beyond her online shop, with her first stall appearing at The Yellow House’s Night Market. Bakeleus’s menu lists a variety of offerings, including jams, granola, tarts, cakes, cookies, cupcakes and brownies. Baral began baking in 2020, during the lockdown, and launched her online shop last year.She grows much of the produce she incorporates into her baking, and believes we should all understand the origins of our food. “This connection fosters gratitude and a deeper appreciation for nature,” she says. Her background in environmental science, coupled with her affinity for the natural world, imbues her creations with a unique artistic sensibility. Each item she bakes is a testament to her creativity and experimentation, as she believes consistent practice is the key to mastery.Despite the demands of being a full-time student, Baral strives to accommodate orders, typically requiring a minimum of 72 hours' notice for delivery. She is a passionate and discerning individual, evident in the love she infuses into her baking. Additionally, Baral advocates for a zero-waste policy at home, ensuring that every scrap of food and all household items are recycled.Three easy to bake recipes you can try at homeMini carrot cakes Ingredients:38 g milk or yoghurt35 g all-purpose flour1/4 tea spoon ground cinnamon1/8 tea spoon ground gingerA pinch of cardamom1 tea spoon baking powder½ tea spoon fine sea salt2 large eggs, at room temperature27 g granulated sugar13 g brown sugar (or 39 g of regular granulated sugar)1 tea spoon vanilla extract27 g extra virgin olive oil33 g carrots, peeled and shreddedChopped walnutsCandied lemon or orange slices (optional for garnish)Cream cheese frosting56.5 g unsalted butter, softened113.5 g cream cheese, softened1/2 teaspoon vanilla extractA pinch of salt250 g powdered sugarDirections:For the cake:Preheat the oven to 195°C.

The vegetable is relatively cheap and used in almost all cuisines and curries. This ubiquity could perhaps be why someone might be snubbingly called an ‘aloo’ in Nepal, but the reference does not make potatoes less important.Why have them With zero fat, potatoes contain many important nutrients—vitamins B1, B6, Vitamin C, which is an antioxidant, minerals and fibre. Along with starch, it is a good source of potassium, copper, vitamin C, manganese, phosphorus, niacin, dietary fibre and pantothenic acid. Potassium derived from potatoes is an electrolyte that benefits the heart, muscles and nervous system. Potato skin contains fibre, which is important for digestive health.Compared to other vegetables, potatoes are more energy-dense. It is free of fat, gluten, cholesterol and sodium. The relatively cheap plant-based food is also a good source of carbohydrates. Filled with nutrients, one can get a lot of them by consuming potatoes.Sourcing of potatoesPotatoes thrive in diverse climatic conditions. The country cultivates potatoes on around 200,000 hectares of land—from the plains of Tarai to the mountainous region.Every year, Nepal churns out around 3,410,000 tons of the stuff. It also imports potatoes and potato products worth Rs 8.71 billion.“These imports include potato chips, frozen potatoes and fresh potatoes,” said Biswas Poudel, a senior technical officer at the National Potato Research Programme.As its cultivation is possible in diverse landscapes, even climate change does not affect potato farming, experts say. Types of potatoesRed and white potatoes are popular and widely available in the country. Lately, dark potatoes or blue potatoes are gaining popularity.“Red potatoes are highly popular,” said Poudel. “Potatoes that come in colour contain more nutrients. Darker potatoes are packed with antioxidants.”Potatoes that taste sweet are a good source of vitamin A, an important nutrient for immunity and eye health. Purple potatoes are rich in antioxidants, including anthocyanins that may prevent heart disease and cancer and boost brain health.Other benefits As potatoes contain important nutrients, they benefit human health in multiple ways. Iron, phosphorus, calcium, magnesium, and zinc contained in potatoes help the body build and maintain its structure and strength. Consumption of the vegetable that is rich in potassium, calcium and magnesium helps reduce blood pressure naturally. Potatoes also contain a significant amount of fibre, which helps in lowering cholesterol levels in the blood and ultimately lessens the risk of heart disease. Fibre also boosts digestive health.Compared to other green vegetables, farmers use only a minimal amount of pesticides in potatoes, making them safe to eat. Chips and french friesOf late potato chips and french fries are gaining popularity in Nepal. They are also popular dishes in most restaurants and people have even started making french fries at home. Children love potato chips the most. Intake of nutrients and micronutrients, fibre and antioxidants components depends on how potatoes were cooked or prepared for food.Consumption of a lot of chips and french fries can lead to added calories and unhealthy weight gain.“Fibre and antioxidant and other micronutrients of the potatoes may be lost while frying,” said Poudel. “As potatoes are a carbohydrate-rich vegetable, it is not necessary to consume them with rice, which many people do in Nepal.”Experts say diabetic people should limit their potato intake as they cause spikes in blood sugar. \n“How much oxygen do you have for the summit?”I think this is the kind of question a film producer would ask. But when you're on the mountain, the answer is never clear.I have worked for a long time in the film industry and different art areas, especially photography and engraving.Working in various fields and drawing inspiration from them has become a new normal for me. I have made this approach my way of life without even realising it.I took responsibility for producing the last movie I worked on and shot the behind-the-scenes footage for a documentary. By doing so, I witnessed the entire shooting process and the journey of a movie.In the snowy highlands of Turkey, we had to endure the consequences of the changing climate to shoot ‘About Dry Grasses’, directed by Nuri Bilge Ceylan. The highlands used to be snowy in January, but by the time we got there in the same month, there was no snow. Nature was changing. It was responding to what was happening—to what humanity had done to it. In the end, it snowed, and we shot the intense snow scenes we wanted. But since most of our days were sunny, unlike what the director wanted, we had to shoot in the sunset and sunrise hours. As crew members, we spent many days waiting for the sun to set.Production requires creating opportunities, finding solutions, and being creative for a work of art to come true. For this, patience, endurance, calmness, and timing are necessary. On the other hand, nature wanted us to listen to it and wait for the right time.During that time, I witnessed many of nature's lessons. For example, I experienced extreme cold for the first time. We endured temperatures ranging from -33 degrees to +55 degrees. By listening to nature, surrendering to its forces, and working within its limits, we managed to persevere.No matter how much you prepare or plan during the pre-production phase, if you are working in nature, remember that nature will always have the final say.The film was completed, released, and connected with audiences. Its success at Cannes 2023 was followed by my trip to the North Pole for my project. I returned with a mix of wonderful developments, joys, and challenges. During this process, I experienced life and death, happiness and sadness, losses and awards.I realised the value of being able to breathe comfortably a few days after my father's chemotherapy ended. Just a few days earlier, he had said, \"Well done, my daughter. I'm glad you went!\" All the anxiety and hard work, filled with fears at the beginning, were finally behind me.Before going to Everest, when I was on the verge of giving up, defeated by my fears, I remembered my father's words. Everest reminded me of what he said while struggling to breathe, adding a turning point to my life.What does it mean to say ‘life’s turning point?’ How many turning points can there be in life?Who am I, and what am I doing in this world? How well do I know my own limits? Can I find answers to these big questions? These thoughts sparked my dream of journeying to Everest. Now, after returning, I can say that it turned my life around.“How much oxygen do you need for the summit?” sounds more like “How much do you need to hold on to life?” How many reasons do you find that give meaning to your life, keep you alive, and allow you to breathe? How much can you endure in the face of obstacles, and can you keep believing that a solution will eventually come your way?Can these questions be separated from the idea of measuring and assessing something, from learning its quantity and financial value? Can everything be known with certainty? Should the journey be fully understood in advance, with all its promises laid out? Should it be viewed like a purchase with a price tag, asking, “Is this journey worth this much?”I had never trekked before and had no climbing experience. I had lived at sea level my entire life and had never been to a high altitude.However, this journey was not only about the physical climb but also an inner discovery. After losing my father to lung cancer, his breathing difficulties taught me the fragility of breath, life, and existence. I also mentally prepared myself for the physical challenges I might face. Despite all my concerns, could this journey help me understand the cycle of life and the resilience of the soul?So, how could I make this trek possible? How could I land in Nepal? Despite all the economic difficulties and the many things I felt needed organising, I did my best and believed in it.Since I was embarking on this journey, I felt I should share about my travels and inspire others.Starting with photography, cinema, and engraving, which are already integral parts of my life, I dreamed of documenting and sharing the inspiring aspects of this journey.After months of correspondence and dreaming, it all came true. Finally, I embarked on the journey with the goal of creating photographs, engravings, and documentaries. I learned a great deal from my travels in Nepal, from the people I met, and from every moments I witnessed. I felt incredibly fortunate to have been able to honour my father’s memory with the peace and serenity I experienced in the Himalayas.During my 15-day journey to Everest Base Camp, I encountered nature’s masterpieces at every turn. As concerns like “How will I endure?” and “How will I finish?” started to weigh on me, the mountains suddenly parted with the clouds and gazed down at me.It was amazing to witness the appearance of ‘Gods’ that I had never seen before, in such immense size and in such a close, awe-inspiring manner beside me during that silent walk.As someone who came from one of the most crowded cities in the world, Istanbul, while I struggled with my daily questions and uncertainties, trying to control everything, they stood there calmly, as if answering me.They were just there—before and after.My guide, Lakhpa Sherpa, always reminded me not to worry about how high we were, how long it would take to reach our accommodation, or what the weather would be like. He encouraged me to live in the moment, and he was right.He advised me to focus on my breathing, not to get thirsty, to eat enough, and to appreciate the extraordinary beauty of the journey. In the mountains, plans dissolve and each moment is embraced as it comes.All the good wishes, prayers, and everything encountered along the way were for the journey itself. The mountain was full of life, secrets, and everything I had wondered about.This 15-day journey to Everest Base Camp was a solo adventure, yet I wouldn't have been able to complete it without my guide, Lhakpa, and my porter. Additionally, I was fortunate enough to experience the hospitality, generosity, and honesty at Trekkers Paradise, which organised the entire journey and provided guidance.I witnessed how dedication and sincerity are crucial in completing a journey safely and healthily. Ghanshyam Sharma, from Trekkers Paradise and Sauraj Jhingan, a climber who summited the Everest in 2018, shared their experiences with me during the journey.They experienced the 2015 earthquake while they were at the Everest Base Camp.As a filmmaker, their role as actors, and attention to detail played a significant role in bringing my dream photography and documentary project to life.The sponsors of my journey were Turkish Airlines, The North Face, Apple, Canon, and Stanley. My supporters include Oscar International College and Nepal Film Campus. Throughout the journey, I shared many experiences, memories, and countless photos and images with my students.On my way back home after 21 days, I celebrated my birthday on the plane. From the right window, the Himalayas bid me farewell. I felt like I had opened a new chapter in my life, and I was certain that I would return.I had made many friends and memories in Nepal.For now, I will be working on a documentary and preparing for a photography and engraving exhibition titled ‘My Soul Beyond the Mountain’.To the Himalayas: This summer was spent with you, but we will meet again soon. \nWe spent five days in Sri Lanka two weeks ago, driving up and down the island, covering almost 70 percent of its territory. Our tour spanned over 1,000 kilometres, including hills, beach spots, and heritage and religious sites.Our first stop in Sri Lanka was Colombo’s Bandaranaike International Airport. We were greeted by a warm and humid breeze when we exited the airport. The host briefed us (a group of journalists) that heavy rainfall has affected areas across Sri Lanka since mid-May 2024. Rain and storms intensified on June 1, with the most significant effects in the south and west of the country. We were lucky to have no rain in the forecast.On the first night, we checked into the lavish Jetwing Lake resort, an opulent sanctuary amidst the lush landscape. The resort’s expansive grounds were a retreat, offering a glimpse of Sri Lanka's natural beauty. We feasted on delicious cuisine, every bite exploding with flavour, introducing us to the island’s famed culinary delights. On June 7, early morning, the sun shone brightly, previewing the promise of an incredible journey ahead. We set off early the following day, eager to explore the mysteries of this enchanting island. As we ventured further into the heart of Sri Lanka, the landscape revealed its majestic nature. We were astounded by seeing Pidurangala Rock, a 200-metre-high granite colossus just a kilometre north of Sigiriya. The short hike to Pidurangala Rock offered breathtaking views of Sigiriya and beyond. We climbed the steep steps and soon were rewarded with a breathtaking panoramic view of the surrounding landscape. It took us 30 minutes to climb. The sight took our breaths away and left us humbled in the presence of such grandeur. From the top are glorious vistas of the surrounding landscape and an incredible view of the majestic Sigiriya Rock. From there, Sigiriya Lion’s Rock is visible, standing alone. This was the place where demon king Ravana had his palace in the Treta Yuga. Believed to have been built 50 centuries ago, the palace is said to have had a unique lift for Ravana and his visitors. Ravana imprisoned Sita in one of the caves at the bottom of this humongous boulder. Sigiriya is a fifth-century fortress in Sri Lanka carved out of an inselberg, a hill of hard volcanic rock that soared high above the surrounding jungle. We spent two hours atop the rock, mainly taking photographs. We descended from Pidurangala Rock, filled with awe and a sense of accomplishment.The journey ahead seemed even more enticing as we ventured along the winding roads, heading towards our next destination.Cash-strapped Sri Lanka plunged into its worst financial crisis in more than seven decades in 2022, with a severe dollar shortage sending inflation soaring to a high of 70 percent, its currency to record lows, and its economy contracting 7.3 percent.Thanks to the growing number of tourists, Sri Lanka is now bouncing back.In Jetwing Lake, we met Kasun Pradeep Somasiri, a receptionist. He briefed us that the resort is now 50 percent occupied. “That’s a better figure now as we are recovering.”The travel and tourism sector is a significant income generator for Sri Lanka. However, the economic crisis, the Ukraine–Russia war, and China’s zero-Covid policy have jeopardised the industry.Tourism accounted for more than 12 percent of the country’s GDP in 2019 and was the third-largest source of foreign exchange reserves, behind worker remittances and the apparel industry.Sri Lanka was poised to be one of the world’s best holiday destinations due to its rich culture, wealth of natural resources, and diversity of accessible experiences.However, tourism-dependent Sri Lanka suffered its first major setback with the Easter bombings 2019. This led to the collapse of inbound tourism flows as international arrivals declined by 18 percent year-on-year, and tourist expenditure fell by 17.7 percent that year. This was immediately followed by two years of pandemic restrictions. Inbound visitors fell to just 116,600 in 2021.An acute balance of payments crisis forced Sri Lanka to preemptively default on foreign debt of over $50 billion in April 2022, triggering a crippling economic contraction with spiralling inflation.“Tourism is gaining momentum,” says Somasiri. “The British and Chinese have started to return to Sri Lanka.”January-August is the peak season for foreigners. “From December to April, local people travel for holiday purposes,” says Somasiri. Before we started the tour to other religious sites, our tour guide, Sampath Mayadunne, told us, “Don't take selfies with your back to Buddha.” Turning your back on a Buddha statue and some other religious sites to take photos and videos is a strict no-no.The most common sight across Sri Lanka is the tank cascades system, an ancient irrigation infrastructure. The system is a network of small tanks draining to large reservoirs that store rainwater and surface runoff for later use.“These infrastructures were built by its ancient kings over 2,000 years ago to solve the water scarcity in the country’s dry zone,” says Mayadunne.On day two, we travelled to Ranweli Spice Garden in Matale. This garden is famous for its rare spices and herbs. A tour of the gardens will show you the cultivation, harvesting, cleaning, and packaging process, as well as the health benefits and uses of the herbs.On the way, we saw a colourful Muthumariamman Hindu temple, boasting hundreds of detailed sculptures in a rich mosaic of colour.In Kandy, we visited the Temple of the Tooth Relic (Sri Dalada Maligawa), one of the most sacred places of worship in the Buddhist world. It was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1988.The temple sustained damage from bombings by Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna in 1989 and by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam in 1998. However, it was fully restored each time.We then headed to Jetwing St Andrew’s, a luxurious 5-star property in Sri Lanka’s hill country of Nuwara Eliya, situated at 1,900 metres above sea level. During our stay in Kandy, we immersed ourselves in the city's charm and the serenity of the countryside. On the third day, early morning, we travelled to Nuwara Eliya, the area famous for tea estates that give many Nepalis the feeling that they have come to Kanyam, Ilam, in eastern Nepal.We visited a tea factory called Damro Labookellie Tea Centre, the oldest tea centre in Sri Lanka. Due to its cold climate, it is the most important area for tea production in Sri Lanka.In this tea factory, they make white and black tea, while the green tea is processed in another tea factory and then sent to Damro.After the tea factory tour and the tea tasting, we headed to Galle, our next resting point.We encountered narrow, winding, and maze-like streets and alleys in Nuwara Eliya, known as ‘Little England’. The town has preserved almost all its British-era buildings and is calm and beautiful. On our way to Galle, at the roadside, our tour guide stopped us at the famed Sita temple, which has Hanuman's footprints and is the place where Sita, wife of Lord Rama, was held captive by the demon king Ravana after he abducted her from India.We were at Sita Eliya, a temple named Sri Seethai Amman.When we reached the Hindu temple, rich in vibrant colours and architectural elements, it was full of devotees. The water stream adjoining the temple is believed to be where Sita bathed. Large footprints are found on the stones in the stream, and there is a saying that those belong to Hanuman, who came spying to find Sita’s whereabouts.In Ella, Ravana’s waterfalls are significant in the Rama-Ravana story. The cascade charms visitors from all over the globe. The waterfall is easily accessible and is known to have hidden caves at the top, which are believed to have been used as Ravana's residence.The 25-metre-tall waterfall is a beautiful cascade that provides the perfect backdrop for a photo to remember your Ramayana trail adventures in Sri Lanka. A short pilgrimage tour ended there, and it was now time for an adventure. Though it was not part of our itinerary, our guide decided to tour us on a train ride.Though short, only six kilometres from Ella to Demodera, it was thrilling. Everyone screamed in unison like kids on a fair ride to hear the echoes in the dark every time we passed through the tunnels. The sound of the train is subtly different inside a tunnel. For the first-timer, the darkness and shouts inside the tunnels when the train passes would be scary, like a horror movie.The train we boarded wasn’t crowded, but people had already filled the doorway, ready for the scenic journey.With the shrill sound of a whistle, the train slowly pulled away from the platform at Ella, passing houses, coconut trees and green fields.As the train progressed, tourists and locals were leaning out the windows and crowding to hang out the doors. I joined the crowd and hung out on a train. A short excitement ended there.After lunch, we headed to Galle and reached Jetwing Lighthouse. As soon as our group entered the hotel, they shouted with excitement.The hotel is on a rocky outcrop three miles west of Galle. Waves crash over giant boulders in front of it and produce howling winds.We were at Galle’s 17th-century fort five minutes from the hotel on day four. In the Bay of Galle on the southwest coast of Sri Lanka, Galle Fort was built first in 1588 by the Portuguese and lavishly rebuilt by the Dutch during the 17th century. It is a historical, archaeological and architectural heritage monument that maintains a perfect appearance even after more than 436 years.We then reached Hikkaduwa Beach, a popular beach destination on the southern coast of Sri Lanka. On the way, we saw a 30-metre-high Big Buddha Statue. It is a replica of the 6th-century Buddhas of Bamiyan destroyed by the Taliban in Afghanistan. It was created using the earliest known sketches of the statue. It was built in remembrance of the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami victims.We then travelled through the 222-kilometre-long Southern Expressway, Sri Lanka's first expressway linking the capital, Colombo, with Galle, Matara, and Hambantota, significant cities south of the island.On day five, we reached Colombo, the capital of Sri Lanka. Jetwing Colombo Seven hosted us in the bustling capital. We took a city tour early morning and visited Bally's Casino at night.On day six, we returned to Kathmandu early in the morning on a Sri Lankan Airlines flight, the airline that organised the trip in coordination with Jetwing Hotels Limited, a Sri Lankan hotel chain.National flag carrier Nepal Airlines, in its previous avatar as Royal Nepal Airlines, used to operate direct flights to Colombo during the 1980s. However, the carrier suspended operations following an armed movement by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) in Sri Lanka. There had been no direct air links between the two countries for decades.In 2016, Himalaya Airlines started a chartered flight that lasted a few months due to low traffic movement between the two countries. Sri Lankan Airlines started operating direct flights to Kathmandu in August 2021.“The main objective of this media tour is to increase tourism in both countries for mutual benefit. We want to draw Nepalis for pilgrims and leisure activities,” says Nilina Pathirana, Country Manager at Srilankan Airlines in Nepal.“We have understood that Nepali travellers tend to travel to Bangkok, Vietnam, Malaysia, Dubai, and Maldives. Nepalis have quite minimal knowledge about Sri Lanka and the religious connection between Lanka and Nepal. We want to promote Nepal and Sri Lanka jointly. This will be a win-win business,” added Pathirana.The airline said it currently carries 60 percent of the passengers from Nepal to Sri Lanka and beyond destinations like Tokyo, Sydney, Melbourne, and other Middle Eastern destinations. The return airfare for a 3.5-hour-long flight starts at Rs74,000. “We have a four-night, five-day package that begins from Rs80,000, depending on the properties and extended itineraries,” says Pathirana.Nepalis must submit certain required documents for visa processing, like their passport copy and bank statement. Due to this government-to-government policy, only Nepalis must obtain a prior visa. Otherwise, Sri Lankans are required to have a visa upon arrival.“The other best thing is that Sri Lankan Airlines can be involved with the visa process or facilitate the Nepalis tourists. Our main intention is to have a sustainable market in Kathmandu and make it a daily flight,” says Pathirana. \nMundhum Trek in Koshi province in the eastern part of Nepal is a new cultural walking trail. It passes through several indigenous ethnic villages and landscapes in Khotang and Bhojpur districts. This trail goes up to an elevation of 4,200 metres to the viewpoint of Silchung Peak and takes one through the settlements of the Kirati people. This route starts from Diktel Bazaar and passes through beautiful settlements like Chakhewa, Rawa Dhap, Salpa Bhanjyang, Silchung and Hanspokhari before ending in Bhojpur. There are some hotels in Diktel but trekkers are advised to carry tents. The trail offers panoramic views of most of the eight-thousanders, including Everest, Lhotse, Makalu, Cho Oyu and Kanchenjunga mountains. The spring season, March through May, is highly recommended for the trek.Janaki Mandir Janaki Mandir at Janakpur in Madhesh province was constructed in 1874 and is a blend of Mughal and local architecture. The temple is a three-storey building and has 60 rooms, making it the largest temple in Nepal. Pilgrims flock here by the thousands to pay homage to Janaki Mandir—Janaki being the other name of Sita, the daughter of King Janak. The temple houses an idol of Sita which was found near Ayodhya, the kingdom of Ram. The marriage anniversary of Lord Ram and Sita is celebrated in Janakpur every year on Vivaha Panchami, which falls in December. In the southwest corner of Janaki Mandir is the Vivaha Mandap, which has been built at the site where the marriage of Ram and Sita is said to have taken place. Another well-known temple in the vicinity is Ram Mandir, which is built in pagoda style and is hence different from the other temples in Janakpur that generally bear resemblance to Mughal architecture. It houses a female statue, said to be of Yogamaya, which has the reputation of being one of the most beautiful images of female forms in Nepal. Other holy sites of interest include the Laxman Temple, Sankat Mochan Temple and Hanuman Temple.Kuri Village, Kalinchok Kuri village, a popular tourist destination around 150 km from Kathmandu, lies at an altitude of 3,842 metres above sea level in Kalinchowk of Dolakha district, in Bagmati province. People visit the place to enjoy the snow during the winter besides the mesmerising landscapes and splendid panoramic view of the Himalayan range. Kalinchok gets snow mainly at the end of December and the snowfall continues till the end of February or mid-March. When there is snow, it is difficult for jeeps, buses and cars to reach the top of Kuri village. Chains are wrapped around the wheels of vehicles and specially modified jeeps with highly experienced drivers are used to carry visitors. There are several hotels and restaurants in the area. The road up to Kuri has also improved over the years.Annapurna Base Camp Annapurna Base Camp trek, in Gandaki province, makes for a picturesque journey that takes you to the foothills of the Annapurna South, up to 4,130 metres above sea level. The five-day trek (seven days for slow walkers) offers rich cultural diversities, typical Nepali villages and the flora and fauna nestled at the foothills of Annapurna. The distance from Pokhara to Annapurna Base Camp is approximately 81 kilometres. It is among the shortest and most budget-friendly treks in Nepal. For Nepalis, lodging costs around $5 to $10 per day. For foreigners, the overall cost of the trek ranges from $800 to $1500 on average per person. Annapurna Base Camp trek can be done at any time throughout the year as each season offers a different trekking experience. The ideal time for the trek depends on your weather preferences and what you expect from it. However, autumn (September to October) and spring (March to May) are considered the two best seasons for the trek, as the days at the time are warm and bright with clear skies.Bardiya National Park Bardiya National Park, located in the southern Tarai belt of Lumbini province, is home to one of the most elusive and majestic animals on earth—the Royal Bengal Tiger. The park, which covers an area of 968 square kilometres, is considered one of the most important protected areas in the country. It is a prime destination for those looking to catch a glimpse of a tiger. A bit of luck and patience will offer a good chance to see the Bengal Tiger. The jungle safari also offers one the opportunity to spot Asian elephants and the greater one-horned rhinoceros. The rare Gangetic river dolphins are occasionally spotted on rafting trips along the Geruwa River, the eastern channel of the Karnali river. Besides, visitors can enjoy the homestays and explore local Tharu culture. The right time to visit the park is from mid-September to mid-December and mid-February to May.Khaptad National Park Khaptad National Park in Sudurpaschim province is a protected area in the far western region. It stretches over four districts of Bajhang, Bajura, Achham and Doti and ranges in elevation from 1,400 to 3,300 metres. The park can be visited throughout the year. Trekkers are advised to bring their tents, food and other supplies. The Nepal Tourism Board says of late, social media has been increasingly influencing Nepali travellers to go to Khaptad. Since the far-flung Khaptad National Park is still offbeat for many travellers, the area remains pristine and fresh. The seasons of spring (March-May) and autumn (October-November) are the ideal times to visit the park. The temperature ranges from 10°c to 20°c offering pleasant trekking weather. The monsoon begins in June and lasts until September and during this time, roads often become muddy and slippery. From December to February, winter brings snow and chilling winds to the park.Limi Valley \nOnce again, my heart swelled with joy when my hometown came into view.Arriving at Lalikharka after the treacherous journey through Pauwa Bhanjyang and the bustling Kanchhi Dokan, Phidim, the headquarters of Panchthar district, revealed itself like a surprise gift. My home town, Phidim, is unique in the fact that it reveals to travellers approaching it from uphill. As the vehicle descends the mountain road, it slowly comes into view, its houses and buildings recognisable for the native son.This Dashain, I undertook the much-awaited trip to my hometown with my wife Kabita and daughter Aarohi. Little did I anticipate the transformation that awaited me.The moment I got out of the jeep, I noticed that Phidim, nestled in the lush hills, has undergone a remarkable transformation over the years. As I guided my family to my home, which had suffered damages in the 1989 quake that struck eastern Nepal, I found that old, mud and stone houses had been replaced by concrete buildings. The place was vastly different from the one I remembered.Arriving at my childhood home felt like reuniting with an old friend. Navigating its nooks and crannies with my daughter, we delved into the history of the house, a symbol of my cherished memories.My wife had visited Phidim years ago, spending a month with my parents. She, too, recalled beautiful moments she had had in the town. I asked the tenant about the neighbours and acquaintances. Some had died, while others had left for good.A call to local journalist Giriraj Banskota led me to the school grounds, where memories flooded back. This was where I spent my teenage years, playing ball, learning to kick, and watching major tournaments. Here, I even encountered a group of Western climbers headed to Kanchenjunga, the world’s third-highest mountain. I remember being awed by their shiny yellow tents, headlights and strange smell. I remember practising my tutephuteko Angrezi with the climbers. Birendra Shield, an annual sports tournament named after the late king, brought ace players from various schools in Panchthar district. The district also hosted Yuba Mela, an annual three-day fair to commemorate the birthday of the king, organising football tournaments in which teams from as far as Sunsari and Taplejung participated. I never excelled at dribbling balls. A boy growing up in a seven-member family, I soon found my interest in literature. In the late 1980s, Phidim hosted a major literary festival. In the run-up to the 1990 pro-democracy protest, walls were painted with anti-monarchy slogans, local politicians were arrested. I took my family to my school, Naya Namuna Secondary School. It was Saturday, so the school was closed. I peeked through the steel gate and wall, imagining myself labouring over classes. Memories are hazy, but what I remember most is going out of the school—to quiz contests with me leading the school team, to essay competitions at the District Education Office and to play carom board, a national pastime, in a nearby shopfront. Returning to the main street, the demolition of a landmark gate made me reflect on how cities transform, shedding old landmarks for new identities. Navigating narrow alleyways, I felt like a stranger in my own hometown. Multistory buildings have emerged and roads have been paved, reshaping the town. It’s the same place with a different face, leaving me nostalgic for the Phidim of my memories.We finally reached Shivalaya temple, which I told my wife and daughter was one of my cherished hangouts. A giant statue of Falgunanda (the Kirant leader’s birthday is celebrated on November 10) stood before the steps to the temple. Though my wife suspected I came here to smoke, in reality, I visited the temple in the evening to meet friends and talk about issues that mattered most to us at the time. It also offered a panoramic view of the town (I could not take my family to Gadhi Danda, a hillock across the Shivalaya).Towards the end of my journey, I felt sad about Phidim’s lack of prospects. To my dismay, I found that people have been leaving the town in droves. Despite blacktopped roads and multi-story buildings, Phidim faces a troubling reality. The lack of quality higher education and specialist healthcare has driven people away, echoing the circumstances that led me to Kathmandu years ago. Conversations with locals confirmed a mass exodus from the town, a trend that raises concerns about Phidim's future.My conversations with familiar strangers led me to conclude that Phidim has transformed into a transit town for pilgrims heading to Pathibhara Devi Temple, which is around 255 kilometres north in Taplejung district. I met dozens of people headed to the holy site. While pilgrims see it as a stopover, for me, it was a homecoming. The realisation dawned that Phidim is, perhaps, in a state of transition, trading its rustic charm for the hallmarks of urbanisation. While I left Phidim for higher education in Kathmandu, people from rural areas have flocked to the town in search of better opportunities, bringing life and energy to the once quiet community.As we bid adieu to my hometown, I couldn’t help but reflect on the inevitability of leaving a place, no matter how enamoured one is with it. Passing Kanchhi Dokan, I pointed out Kanchnajungha and Kumbhakarna to my daughter—symbols of my childhood. Phidim, now a blend of nostalgia and change, remains etched in my heart, a testament to the intricate dance between memory and evolution. \nThe gate leading inside the city of Lucknow proudly declares, “Muskuraiye aap Lucknow mein hain” (Smile because you are in Lucknow). During my brief stay, the city lived upto its promise. Known as the city of Nawabs, with a rich history going centuries back, the city is abuzz with autos, rickshaws, honks of public buses and the constant loud sounds of the metro going over your head, irritable honks of public buses and food that leaves you wanting more.In such a happening place stands Bara Imambara, built in 1784 by Asaf-ud-Daula. ‘Bara’ means big, and ‘Imambara’ is a building with a big hall where people assemble for mourning congregations. This building was originally built to provide employment for the public because, at that period, the country was going through a famine, and it was seen as a relief project. I walked through the grand entrance gate known as Rumi Darwaza (Turkish Gate), wiping my sweat and fighting the Lucknow heat, entering the vast complex. Echoing in all corners was a voice from the speaker that kept reminding the visitors of the many rules inside the historical place. I tried not to let the wonder overwhelm me as I walked through the complex. To my right stood the elegant Asafi Mosque, recently painted in cream-like white. Its design is visually pleasing and a testament to the Mughal era’s artistic finesse. Its walls are adorned with intricate calligraphy and elegant designs, reminiscent of a time when such aesthetics held great importance. I couldn’t help but admire the tremendous effort the craftsmen put into bringing the Nawab’s vision to life, meticulously crafting the elegant domes which seemed to touch the sky. The mosque’s serene atmosphere stands in stark contrast to the bustling city just beyond its walls.Upon stepping into the main hall—known as Asafi Hall—I was immediately struck by its sheer size. It is vast and impressive, appearing to stretch into eternity, and its massive arched roof seemed to defy gravity. What’s even more intriguing is that it stands without the support of pillars or beams. The interlocking system of bricks, a hidden secret, upholds this colossal structure, leaving one in awe of the brilliance of the builders of the past.This very hall houses a large vaulted central chamber with the tomb of Asaf-ud-Daula. Standing beside his tomb was a chilling moment, knowing that the remains of a great historical figure was resting just a few feet below. After scanning the large hall, the guide took me to my favourite part of the Imambara—the labyrinth or the Bhool Bhulaiyaa. This labyrinth sits right above the main hall, and because the hall is unsupported, the ceiling had to be lightweight, so the hollow labyrinth was born. It is quite impossible to figure out the Bhool Bhulaiyaa on your own, as it is a confusing network of corridors and staircases. So, it is necessary to have the company and guidance of a guide.As I moved with my guide through the maze, I thought I could feel the presence of the past inhabitants who had walked through these confusing passageways. What fascinated me most was the maze’s design: every sound, no matter how faint, echoed through the structure, enhancing its aura of mystery.The guide whispered from a distance, his head close to the wall, and the sound reached my ears, even though he was out of sight. It felt as if the walls carried the whispers. We exchanged astonished glances. When the guide reappeared, he smiled and remarked, “Now, you understand why they say that walls have ears.”Exiting the maze, I climbed to the roof, which offered a breathtaking view of Lucknow. The city spread out in front of me, its modern skyline contrasting the monument’s historic charm. It was a moment of reflection, contemplating how centuries had passed, and yet, Bara Imambara stood as a timeless witness to the changing tides of history. As I stood there, taking it all in, I felt recharged by the air coming in from all directions. After descending from the terrace, my brisk guide led me to the final stop in the Imambara, Shahi Baoli (Stepwell). Also referred to as the royal stepwell, it sits underground and is another example of architectural brilliance in the complex. This didn’t surprise me much since it was built at a time when architecture wasn’t just functional but also a work of art.The moment I descended the steps that led me underground, I noticed the sudden drop in temperature. The Shahi Baoli served as a cool refuge during the blistering summer day. The well-planned architecture of the Baoli allowed it to naturally regulate its temperature. The way to the main well is locked, but visitors can throw coins through jail-like doors into the well in order to try out their luck, much like we do in Davis Falls in Pokhara.Entering the underground corridors, I felt a slight chill because it was cold and dimly lit. I turned on my phone’s flashlight and saw the walls adorned with intricate Mughal carvings. Upon reaching a spot where we could see the well, the guide informed us that the well acted as a CCTV camera at the time. He explained that individuals inside the structure could discreetly observe those entering, as their reflections would be visible on the well’s water, but the people entering could not see the people inside the building.I waited to see that happen, and when a group entered through the gate, I was stunned; their faces were perfectly mirrored on the water’s surface, showcasing the ingenuity behind the well’s design, serving both as a water source and a security measure.My experience at Bara Imambara was a delightful one. I had never seen such a remarkable work of architecture before—it is beautiful, interesting and ahead of its time. \nPanama beat Bolivia 3-1 on Monday to finish second in Group C and qualify for the Copa America quarter-finals after tournament hosts the United States were eliminated following a 1-0 loss to group winners Uruguay.The win moved Panama, playing in only their second Copa America, up to second on six points, three more than the US, as the central American side reached the knockout stage for the first time.Uruguay finished with nine points.Jose Fajardo opened the scoring for Panama while substitutes Eduardo Guerrero and Cesar Yanis scored late to seal all three points, with Bolivia’s lone goal coming from Bruno Miranda.Bolivia needed a win with only a slim chance of staying alive in the tournament, but it was Panama who broke the deadlock in the 22nd minute when Cristian Martinez set up Fajardo.The 30-year-old forward expertly controlled Martinez’s header into the box, let it bounce and volleyed the ball past Bolivia goalkeeper Guillermo Viscarra.Bolivia equalised in the 69th minute when they cut through Panama’s midfield and defence, with Ramiro Vaca finding Miranda, who slipped his shot past the keeper.Bolivia nearly took the lead in the 78th minute when Panama goalkeeper Orlando Mosquera ventured out of the box but Miguel Terceros’s long-range effort was thwarted by the retreating Panama defence.A minute later, Panama wrested back control of qualification when Davis curled in a cross from the left and Guerrero connected with a glancing header - his first goal for his country.Yanis made sure of victory in the first minute of added time, blasting a right-footed shot into the top right corner after he was put through on goal, sparking wild celebrations at the Inter&Co Stadium.While Panama wait to learn their quarter-final opponents with Group D set to finish their games on Tuesday, Bolivia exit the tournament after three straight losses having conceded 10 goals and scoring just one. \nGoalkeeper Diogo Costa saved all three penalties as Portugal won 3-0 in a shootout against a brave Slovenia side who had held them to a 0-0 draw after Cristiano Ronaldo’s extra-time miss from the spot in a dramatic Euro 2024 last-16 clash on Monday.Portugal had the lion’s share of the chances but also their brilliant goalkeeper to thank for a one-on-one save from Slovenia striker Benjamin Sesko as they stumbled into a quarter-final meeting with France in Hamburg on Friday.Costa also saved from Josip Ilicic, Jure Balkovec and Benjamin Verbic in the shootout - the first keeper to save three penalties in a Euros shootout - to send his side through despite a team performance that lacked spark for the most part.“This is probably the best game of my life,” Costa said. “I focused on doing what I had to do. I went with my gut feeling. Of course we had analysed the penalty takers, but players change how they shoot. I'm very happy and very excited to have helped the team.”Ronaldo in particular will come under the spotlight as he wasted several opportunities to go with a penalty miss in extra-time that left him in a flood of tears and needing to be consoled by team mates.Portugal were awarded the penalty late in the first half of extra time when Diogo Jota’s storming run into the box was illegally stopped by defender Vanja Drkusic, who had already been booked and was lucky not to receive a second yellow card.They have a reliable penalty taker in their team in Bruno Fernandes but captain Ronaldo elected to take it and his effort was superbly saved to his left by Slovenia’s Jan Oblak, who pushed the ball onto the post.“Even the strongest people have their (bad) days. I was at rock bottom ... when the team needed me the most,” Ronaldo said in a post-match interview before bursting into tears again.“Sadness at the start is joy at the end. That’s what football is. Moments, inexplicable moments,” he said. \nAn 85th-minute deflected shot by Randal Kolo Muani, listed as a Jan Vertonghen own goal, gave France a nervy 1-0 win over a disappointing Belgium on Monday and sent them into the quarter-finals despite another poor show by their misfiring forwards.France made most of the running in a cagey game but were reckless with their finishing, until a nice combination of passes, finished off by N’Golo Kante, finally created space for substitute Kolo Muani to turn and bundle a mishit shot in off the leg of Vertonghen and leave goalkeeper Koen Casteels wrong-footed.France will now meet the winner of Monday’s match Portugal in the quarter-finals in Hamburg on Friday.It was a fittingly scruffy decider for an underwhelming game and means that France still have yet to score in open play at the tournament, recording two own goals and a Kylian Mbappe penalty across their four games.Various combinations have been tried up front, while midfielders and defenders also caught the bug on Monday with some wild attempts, but coach Didier Deschamps, unsurprisingly, preferred to focus on the positives.Belgium clearly had a plan to take any speed out of the game, playing at less than walking pace at times, with Kevin de Bruyne often operating just in front of his back four.The only decent chance of the first half came for France after 34 minutes when Jules Kounde whipped in a curling cross that recalled striker Marcus Thuram headed wide.Aurelien Tchouameni forced Koen Casteels into his first save of the day soon after the break, while ever-lively Mbappe miskicked a decent chance as France began to put some passes together.A rare Belgian thrust was cut short by a brilliant Theo Hernandez tackle just as Yannick Carrasco was about to pull the trigger and Romelu Lukaku and De Bruyne then brought good saves from Mike Maignan.France were in the ascendancy but the poor finishing that has dogged their campaign continued with William Saliba and Mbappe both blazing wildly over before Kolo Muani's decisive intervention.It was a meeting between officially the second (France) and third (Belgium) best teams in the world, but after both edged into the knockout stage managing only two goals apiece from their three games, both looked extremely cautious in attack for most of it.For Belgium, another dispiritingly tame exit adds to their appalling record in the European championship since losing in the final in \nAustralia said on Monday it had more than doubled the visa fee for international students, the latest move by the government to rein in record migration that has intensified pressure on an already tight housing market.From July 1, the international student visa fee has risen to A$1,600 ($1,068) from A$710, while visitor visa holders and students with temporary graduate visas are banned from applying onshore for a student visa.“The changes coming into force today will help restore integrity to our international education system, and create a migration system which is fairer, smaller and better able to deliver for Australia,” Home Affairs Minister Clare O’Neil said in a statement.Official data released in March showed net immigration rose 60% to a record 548,800 people in the year to Sept. 30, 2023.The rise in fees makes applying for a student visa for Australia far more expensive than in competing countries like the U.S. and Canada, where they cost about $185 and C$150 ($110) respectively.The government said it was also closing loopholes in visa rules that allowed foreign students to continuously extend their stay in Australia, after the number of students on a second or subsequent student visa spiked by over 30% to more than 150,000 in 2022–23.The latest move follows a raft of actions since late last year to tighten the student visa rules as the lifting of COVID-19 curbs in 2022 boosted annual migration to record levels.English language requirements were tightened in March, while the amount of savings international students need to get a visa was raised in May to A$29,710 ($19,823) from A$24,505, the second increase in about seven months.Universities Australia CEO Luke Sheehy said the government’s continued policy pressure on the sector would put the country's position of strength at risk.“This is not good for our economy or our universities, both of which rely heavily on international student fees,” Sheehy said in an emailed response.International education is one of Australia’s largest export industries and was worth A$36.4 billion to the economy in the 2022-2023 financial year. \nPresident Joe Biden’s train-wreck debate with Republican opponent Donald Trump followed a series of decisions by his most senior advisers that critics now point to as wrong-headed, interviews with Democratic allies, donors and former and current aides show.Trump, 78, repeated a series of well-worn, glaring falsehoods during the 90-minute debate on Thursday, including claims that he actually won the 2020 election.Biden, 81, failed to refute them and his fumbling, halting performance has sparked calls from Democrats for him to end his quest for a second term and for “soul-searching” or resignations among top aides.“My only request was make sure he’s rested before the debate, but he was exhausted. He was unwell,” said one person who said they appealed to Biden’s top aides in the days before, to no avail. “What a bad decision to send him out looking sick and exhausted.”Others were even more pointed.“It is my belief that he was over-coached, over-practiced. And I believe [senior aide] Anita Dunn... put him in a venue that was conducive for Trump and not for him,” said John Morgan, a Florida-based attorney and major Biden fundraiser.Morgan said Dunn and her husband, Bob Bauer, the president’s attorney who played Trump in pre-debate rehearsals, should “be fired forever and never let back anywhere near the campaign.”Biden’s debate strategy was signed off on by campaign chair Jen O’Malley Dillon, who helped him win in 2020 and was appointed in January to boost an uneven reelection campaign. Dunn, a longtime Biden aide and former Barack Obama campaign strategist, backed that strategy.Confidence going into the event was high. Trump was convicted of falsifying documents by a jury in New York on May 31, while Biden held back-to-back visits in Europe.To the surprise of some Biden aides, his stubbornly low poll numbers began to inch up nationally in the weeks that followed.Advisers set up a rigorous debate prep calendar, with Biden sequestered at Camp David for six days.An inner circle, some close to Biden for decades, were involved: Ron Klain, his first White House chief of staff, Dunn, former White House counsel and long-time adviser Mike Donilon, as well as about a dozen other policy and political experts.Biden’s campaign said on Friday that no staff shake-up was under consideration. Multiple aides, not just Dunn and Bauer, were involved in the preparation, said a campaign official, who also noted that Morgan was not there.In an email to supporters Saturday, O’Malley Dillon said internal polls and focus groups showed no change in voters’ opinions in battleground states after the debate. She warned “overblown media narratives” may drive “temporary dips in the polls,” but said she was confident Biden would win in November. \nFrench voters headed to the polls on Sunday in the first round of a snap parliamentary election that could usher in the country’s first far-right government since World War Two, a potential sea change at the heart of the European Union.President Emmanuel Macron stunned the country when he called the vote after his centrist alliance was crushed in European elections this month by Marine Le Pen’s National Rally (RN). Her eurosceptic, anti-immigrant party was a longtime pariah but is now closer to power than it has ever been.Polls opened at 0600 GMT and will close at 1600 GMT in small towns and cities, with an 1800 GMT finish in the bigger cities, when the first exit polls for the night and seat projections for the decisive second round a week later are expected.However the electoral system can make it hard to estimate the precise distribution of seats in the 577-seat National Assembly, and the final outcome will not be known until the end of voting on July 7.“We are going to win an absolute majority,” Le Pen said in a newspaper interview on Wednesday, predicting that her protégé, 28-year-old Jordan Bardella, would be prime minister. Her party has a high-spending economic programme and seeks to reduce immigration.A woman screamed “It’s shameful, it’s shameful” as Bardella arrived to cast his vote in Garches near Paris. “They even invited the leftists,” he said.If the RN does win an absolute majority, French diplomacy could be headed for an unprecedented period of turbulence: with Macron - who has said he will continue his presidency until the end of his term in 2027 - and Bardella jostling for the right to speak for France.France has had three periods of “cohabitation” - when the president and government are from opposite political camps - in its post-war history, but none with such radically divergent world views competing at the top of the state.Bardella has already indicated he would challenge Macron on global issues. France could lurch from being a pillar of the EU to a thorn in its side, demanding a rebate of the French contribution to the EU budget, clashing with Brussels over European Commission jobs and reversing Macron’s calls for greater EU unity and assertiveness on defence.A clear RN victory would also bring uncertainty as to where France stands on the Russia-Ukraine war. Le Pen has a history of pro-Russian sentiment and while the party now says it would help Ukraine defend itself against Russian invaders, it has also set out red lines, such as refusing to provide long-range missiles.In Hénin-Beaumont, a town in Le Pen’s constituency in northern France where she may be re-elected in the first round, 67-year-old Denis Ledieu said people were suffering due to the long-term deindustrializaton of the region.“So if the (RN) promises them things, then why not? They want to try it out, I think,” he said.Across France, early turnout figures were higher than in the 2022 legislative vote, at 25.9% by midday, compared with 18.43% two years ago, the interior ministry said.‘Split vote favours RN’Opinion polls have suggested the RN has a comfortable lead of 33%-36% of the popular vote, with a hastily assembled left-wing coalition, the New Popular Front, in second place on 28%-31% and Macron’s centrist alliance in third on 20%-23%.The New Popular Front includes a wide range of parties, from the moderate centre-left to the hard-left, eurosceptic, anti-NATO party France Unbowed, led by one of Macron’s most vitriolic opponents, Jean-Luc Melenchon.How the poll numbers will translate into seats in the National Assembly is hard to predict because of how the election works, said Vincent Martigny, professor of political science at the University of Nice and the Ecole Polytechnique.Candidates can be elected in the first round if they win an absolute majority of votes in their constituency, but that is rare. Most constituencies will need a second round involving all candidates who received votes from at least 12.5% of registered voters in the first round. The top scorer wins.“If you have a very high level of participation you might have a third or fourth party that is getting into the struggle. So then of course there’s a risk of split voting and we know that the split vote favours the National Rally,” Martigny said.For decades, as the far right steadily gained popularity, voters and parties who did not support it would unite against it whenever it edged closer to national power, but that may not hold true this time.Martigny said no one knew whether candidates from Macron’s camp would consider dropping out of the second round to give rivals from the left a chance of beating the RN, or the reverse.Le Pen and Bardella have sought to make their party’s image more acceptable to the mainstream, for example by denouncing antisemitism. Le Pen’s father Jean-Marie Le Pen, founder and long-term leader of the RN’s forerunner, had a history of overtly antisemitic comments.But critics say the RN’s courting of Jews is just a cover allowing it to deny accusations of racism while constantly stigmatising Muslims and foreigners. \nA Russian missile strike hit a nine-storey residential building in the central Ukrainian city of Dnipro on Friday, killing at least one person and injuring 12 others, officials said.Interior Minister Ihor Klymenko warned the death toll would likely rise as more people remained trapped in the building where four upper storeys collapsed as a result of the attack.Later statements from the Interior Ministry said the fire at the site had been extinguished, the remains of one person had been detected underneath the rubble and two people were listed as missing.Regional governor Serhiy Lysak said 12 people had been injured, including a 7-month-old infant. Three people were in severe condition.A photograph published by Lysak on the Telegram messaging app and other images circulated on social media showed a badly damaged building that had smoke rising from a gaping hole in its upper storeys.President Volodymyr Zelenskiy called on Ukraine’s allies to step up supplies of air defences to help the military intercept Russia’s regular aerial attacks.Dnipro, which had a pre-war population of almost one million people, is a major Ukrainian city that lies on the road to the east of the country where the most intense fighting with Russian forces is raging.It has been regularly targeted by missile and drone strikes since Russia launched its February 2022 invasion. Russia denies targeting civilians and civilian infrastructure, but thousands of people have been killed. \nNepal’s book market is no stranger to the popular Bangladeshi-Swedish writer Taslima Nasrin. Almost all of her books have been translated into Nepali, but Nasrin herself says that they are all unauthorised translations. “All books [Nepali translations] are pirated versions,” Nasrin told the Post in a Whatsapp conversation. Nasrin, who is currently in exile in India after facing death threats in Bangladesh following the publication of her novel Lajja (Shame), said that she or her publishers have never allowed anyone the right to translate her books into Nepali. “I don’t know of any such Nepali publishers. No one asked for permission and no one has paid [me] royalty.”Translating and publishing books without permission from authors or publishers is a punishable crime. But Nepal’s book market is full of such unauthorised translations and prints of books written by the who’s who of the world literature. Such endeavours haven’t just hurt the authors but also the readers, says Ajit Baral, publisher of the Kathmandu-based Fineprint publication. “These translations are poor,” Baral says. “Tomes with 1200–1300 pages have been trimmed to 200–300 pages. An example is the biography of Bill Clinton.”Another popular book that has seen unauthorised Nepali translation is the biography of Steve Jobs by Walter Isaacson.“We have no official deal in place for a [Nepali] translation of Steve Jobs,” Peppa Mignone, associate agent of the CAA, the translation authority of the biography, said in an email interview with the Post.The book’s Nepali translation is published by Panchpokhari Publication House. The translated book identifies the translator thus: “Achyut Koirala, who has a master’s in English literature, is primarily a journalist. He is currently affiliated with Nagarik daily. He keeps a close tab on international history, politics and culture and has written scripts and dialogues for half a dozen Nepali films. He has published over a dozen non-fiction books.”Koirala, who admits to the unauthorised translation, claims that he hasn’t just translated the book but has also done ‘creative writing’ with it.‘Rich Dad Poor Dad’, written by Robert Kiyosaki and Sharon Lechter, is among the books that’s perennially on the bestseller list across the world. Upon investigation, the Post found three Nepali translations of the book—all unauthorised. One of them is translated by Dilip Kumar Shrestha and published by the same firm, the Panchpokhari Publication House. Another Nepali iteration of the book is published by Book For All publication and translated by Kopila MD. Yet another Nepali version is translated by one Sudheer Dixit and published by Plata Publication, Kathmandu.In an email conversation with the Post, Ronson Taylor, who oversees the international rights at The Rich Dad Company, said, “At this point in time, we do not have a relationship with an established publisher in the [Nepali] language market. If there are any Rich Dad Poor Dad books currently for sale in the Nepali market, they are pirated.”Basanta Thapa, a writer and translator, says that many books are being translated of late to make easy money. “But how would the quality of these unauthorised translations be!” Thapa wonders. “Readers who haven’t read the original wouldn’t know the faults in the translated versions.” Thapa says that any translator worth his salt aims to ‘recreate’ a book and it takes much work to do that.Taslima’s books are the major victimsTaslima’s memoir Uttal Hawa has been translated into Nepali as ‘Sangharsha’, literally Struggle, and is published by Khoji Publication House. Even though the book in its cover claims that it is an authorised translation from the English version Wild Wind, it is a pirated one. The book is translated by Bikash Basnet and edited by Bhogiraj Chamling. A revised version of the book is edited by Sangeet Srota (Yam Bahadur Chhetri).The same publication house has also published the Nepali translation of the book’s sequel as ‘Prem ra Jeevan’. Publisher Sushil Chalise says that while he is aware that one needs to receive permission from the author or the publisher to translate a book, his efforts to contact Taslima were unsuccessful. Therefore, he had published the version the translator made available to him. Translator Basnet, too, admits he translated the book without Taslima’s permission. “About a decade back, we didn’t know how to ask for permission,” he said.Nepal has the Copyright Act (2002) in place. Before it, there was the The Patent, Design and Trade Mark Act, 2022 (1965) that included intellectual property in its 2006 revision. Even the Muluki Ain (Civil Code) of 1910 BS had a provision about copyright. Moreover, it goes without saying that translating somebody else’s work without permission is immoral.Likewise, Indigo Ink Pvt Ltd has published a Nepali translation of Taslima’s anthology of essays No Country for Women as ‘Aaimai ko Kunai Desh Chhaina’. The book is translated by Krishna Giri and edited by Pramod Pradhan. “I have no idea about the agreement between the publisher and translator,” Pradhan, who is also a children’s book writer, says. “I just copy-edited it upon request.”Bishnukumar Poudel, publisher of Indigo Ink, however, claims that he is still trying to take translation rights for the book. “We translated the book long ago,” he says. “We are still trying to get translation rights.”Indigo is also publishing unauthorised translations under its imprints All Book Store Pvt Ltd, Book for All and Plata Publication. It has published two versions of Rich Dad Poor Dad under those shadow imprints. But Plata Publication is not registered in the Company Registrar’s Office.Pradhan says that many foreign books have had unauthorised translations in Nepali and their quality is poor. Those books are translated not from the original language but from a second or third language, so these translations are bound to have problems, he says. “After I learned that those were unauthorised translations, I have stopped editing them,” Pradhan said.Indian author Shiv Khera’s You Can Win has been translated into Nepali by Bloomsbury India and has granted the distribution rights to Ekta Books. But the book’s unauthorised translations are also found in the market and they don’t even mention the name of the publisher and translator. What is interesting is they mention that it’d be illegal to republish the book, or an excerpt of it, without the author’s permission.The Nepali translation of the book, which was poorly written and rife with inaccuracies, had landed the publisher at court. After a complaint was filed at the District Court Kathmandu in 2066BS on the charge that the publisher violated the copyrights and economic rights, the court had issued a verdict on Mangsir 11 that year, charging a fine of Rs10,000, Rs20,000 and Rs30,000 to the defendants Netra Prasad Pokharel, Narayan Prasad Bhusal, and Bhagwati Risal and Bishnu Silwal, respectively.Baral, the Fineprint publisher, says that international publishers wouldn’t demand much for translation rights given Nepal’s small market, but Nepali publishers do not bother to reach out to them. “Publishers who put out unauthorised translations and sell them at 50 percent discount have troubled publishers like us,” he said.Fineprint has published authorised translated versions of books such as Leaving Microsoft to Change the World by John Wood, Healed by Manisha Koirala, and Hippie by Paulo Coelho. The publication house is also set to release the Nepali translation of Israeli historian Yuval Noah Harari’s bestseller Sapiens. Translated into Nepali by Dinesh Kafle, the book’s translation right was acquired at the cost of USD1300, Baral said. Likewise, the publication acquired the translation rights of Sadhguru’s Inner Engineering at IRS93,000, he added.Baral says that publication of unauthorised translations is an immoral and illegal work. “This phenomenon not just hampers Nepal’s fledgling book publishing industry but also tarnishes the country’s reputation in the global market,” Baral said.Thapa, the writer and translator, points out the lack of regulatory mechanisms in the country. “We don’t have an agency that regulates the quality of translations being done,” he says. “Nobody compares the translation with the original. We need a dedicated authority to enhance the quality of translation.” Universities, Nepal Academy and other stakeholders can play a role to uplift the translation sector, he adds.One’s pain, another’s pleasureWhen the author Suketu Mehta was travelling through Mumbai, a young man approached him with a handful of books while his vehicle was stuck in traffic. Brandishing Maximum City, written by none other than Mehta himself, the young man requested the author to buy a copy. Suketu leafed through the book and said, “This is a pirated copy and I’m the author of this book.” The youth wasn’t bothered and replied, “Okay, you can buy it at a discount.”This anecdote was shared to the Post by Mehta’s friend, the author and professor Amitava Kumar, in an email exchange.Most of these pirated books are imported into Nepal from India while the retailers of original books are finding themselves increasingly in trouble. “We sell original copies but many readers doubt us as well, given the ubiquity of pirated versions,” says Anjan Shrestha, operator of Education Book House, Jamal.Ramchandra Timothy, chair of Thapathali-based Ekta Books Pvt Ltd, said that the phenomenon of piracy has tarnished Nepal’s image internationally. “There was a time when Bangladesh would be known as ‘piracy king’,” he said. “Now there's a risk Nepal would take the crown.”As tax increases, so does piracyThe government decision to impose a 10 percent tax on book imports in fiscal year 2019-20 led to a proliferation of pirated book markets, booksellers say. After the decision, booksellers started to cut back on imports and that led to the entry of a new crop of pirated booksellers, a trader in Kathmandu says. But following widespread backlash, then finance minister Bishnu Paudel struck down the policy.“After the government’s decision, we stopped importing books for a while,” says Shrestha of Education Books. “The import of books went down for about two years. Then the pirates stepped in to fill the gap. It was about that time that pirated copies of biographies and memoirs of Obamas and Jai Shettys became omnipresent in the market.”Pirated copies of classics by Roald Dahl and JK Rowling also made an entry in the Nepali market. Then the phenomenon only saw a rise.Since the customs department does not levy duty on foreign books and also does not care to differentiate between the pirated and original copies, unauthorised books have found a safe haven in Nepali market.The government doesn’t levy any customs duty on books and newspapers published by foreign publishers abroad. The importers should only pay Rs565 at the customs points. But Nepali publishers have to pay 10 percent tax to import books printed in India.James Taylor, director of Communications and Freedom to Publish of the International Publishers Association, says that the government, publishers, writers and readers should join hands to control widespread piracy. “The government should realise that book publishing and reading culture contribute to the country’s economy as well,” he said, adding that the government should seize pirated books and close websites that sell pirated ebooks.Nandan Jha, executive vice chair of Penguin Random House India’s sales, production and business department, says that piracy has emerged as a big challenge for publishers of late and has harmed the authors, publishers, distributors, printers, readers and other stakeholders. “To confront piracy, all the stakeholders should launch a special joint effort,” Jha told the Post in an email exchange.Piracy has proliferated in the Nepali market to such an extent that the publishers of such books and unauthorised translations keep whatever ISBN numbers they like, often conflicting with other books, and still get off scot free. If scanned or searched on the internet, the ISBN number gives details on the author of the book, what the book is about, and its price, among others.Bijay Sharma, information officer at TU Library, says, “Keeping ISBN number at one’s will is illegal. If anyone files a complaint, we can punish them.”By the lawThe Muluki Ain-1910 BS had mandated that a publisher take permission of Gorkha Bhasa Prakashini Samiti before publishing any material. The Copyrights Act came into effect in 2022 BS and was amended in 2054 BS. In 2059 BS, a new Act was promulgated and it is still effective now. Authorities are currently working to amend the Act to give the registrar’s office more autonomy regarding copyright.According to the 2059 BS Act, copyright violations are considered government cases. In such cases, plaintiffs should file a complaint with the police. The Act’s clause 25 has various conditions that amount to violation of copyright. The Act’s subclause A says that if a publisher produces or copies material in writing or sound and sells or distributes it, it amounts to violation of copyright.Likewise, the Act’s clause 26 prevents selling of unauthorised material. The clause restricts the ‘importation of copies of work or sound recording, either made in a foreign country or sourced otherwise, into Nepal for business purpose shall not be permitted if preparation of such copies would be considered illegal if they were prepared in Nepal.’If anyone infringes upon protected rights, they are liable to punishment but the provision’s implementation remains lax.The law gives the authority to district court to take legal action against copyright violators.Advocate Parshuram Koirala says that if the government becomes more proactive, it can punish violators on the basis of the 2059 BS Act and thereby control the phenomenon of intellectual theft and copyright violations. “Creation is a crucial part of humanity’s benefit,” he says. “If intellectual property is not protected effectively, then there’d be no inspiration to create something.”Bal Bahadur Mukhiya, a professor at Nepal Law Campus, suggests the inclusion of rules about digital piracy in law, and also the clauses of various related international treaties and agreements that Nepal is part of.“In the US, a teacher or professor should pay a certain revenue even to photocopy a chapter of some text for teaching purposes,” Mukhiya says. “But in Nepal, those who photocopy an entire book and sell it go scot free.”(This report is prepared in collaboration with the Centre for Investigative Journalism, Nepal.) \nBharat Budha, chair of Putha Uttarganga Rural Municipality’s ward 10, knows that many youths from his village have made it to the United States via ‘tallo bato’—backdoor route—and that many are still on the way. He also knows that eight of them have been deported from the country and that they have lost a cumulative Rs45 million in the process. The deported youths say that they returned home empty-handed after facing unspeakable ordeals and lost Rs6 million each on average.The Tak village in Rukum East—a close-knit settlement of 425 houses—was considered the Maoists’ ‘base area’ during the insurgency. Village youths who reached the US through illegal routes and got deported have lost an estimated Rs40 million. The number of those who returned without completing the journey and the amount they lost remain unknown.To get to the US, the youths have taken loans at up to 36 percent interest per annum from their relatives and village landowners. In Tak village, at least one person each from half of the households has gone abroad, Budha said. “Youths started going to America about six-seven years ago,” he said. “If they could gather enough money, the whole village would try to go to the US.” Budha’s own son had reached the US illegally in 2017, spending Rs3.2 million.During the insurgency, outsize slogans of revolution would adorn the walls of houses in the village. Hoping for a better life, people from all walks of life helped out the Maoists. But now, village youths are paying the agents to illegally get to the US—a country that the Maoists used to call their ‘enemy’, an ‘imperialistic force’. This has cost the Tak village much and in multiple ways.Death of a dreamSome of the deported youths have chosen to flee the village altogether, burdened with debt and creditors’ pressure. At least five such families have already left, said a resident. The family of Ram Budha was one of them. On April 28, 2015, Ram, who had returned to Nepal after working in Malaysia for eight years, took the illegal route to the US. He travelled through arduous trails for months and finally arrived in the country. Upon reaching the country, he was detained and had to stay at the detention camp for 27 months. When his refugee application was rejected, he was deported to Nepal in mid-December 2019. He lost Rs4.5 million in the process. He now owes over Rs6 million to creditors. “After the creditors began to put pressure on me, I couldn’t live in the village peacefully,” said Ram, who currently runs a vegetable farm in Tarakeshwar, Kathmandu.While those who got to the US through illegal routes and fortunately got refugee status there narrate their stories with pride, those who have been deported or returned from half-way have tragic tales to tell.Nanda Kala Gharti, who lives in a small stone house on the upper flank of Tak village, spends her days in melancholy. Her husband, Dhanlal, had chosen to take the illegal route to the US, and Nanda Kala, a mother of four, is living with the repercussions of his decision. Dhanlal had got into the US after a six-month long arduous journey and was detained immediately. He had to spend four years in the detention camp, before he was deported to Nepal. He had already lost Rs6 million.Nanda Kala said they now have an insurmountable crisis in their hands. Pointing to her son, she exclaimed, “When will he grow up, go abroad and pay back the loans!”Dhanlal himself tried to go to Croatia once and spent 15 days in Kathmandu for the process. But after he was turned down, he returned home dejected. “Now we will submit the passport to another agent [for Dhanlal’s trip abroad],” Nanda Kala said. “There’s no point staying here.”Stories that echo each otherThe situation in Sisne Rural Municipality is similar to that of Putha Uttarganga. Here, one can hear plenty of stories of those who have tried to go to the US and those who are fighting refugee cases there. Krishna Regmi, chair of the rural municipality, personally knows seven people who have been deported from the US.Gangaram Khadka, a resident of Sisne-3, runs a bee and chicken farm. Like other young men in his village, Khadka had headed off to the US via an illegal route on 27 March, 2018. He had reached the US via the New Delhi-Moscow-Barcelona-Bogota-Panama-Costa Rica-Nicaragua-Honduras-Guatemala-Mexico route. When he finally arrived in the US, he was detained and had to spend 11 months in detention. He was deported on 15 March, 2019. He had handed over Rs3.2 millions to the agent and spent Rs2 million to fight the case to become a refugee. “It’s not possible for me to pay back the loan while working in Nepal,” he said. “I aim to pay back some interest and head off abroad again.”For six months after Khadka was deported, he had anxiety and headache, he said, adding the three people from his village who were deported like him are also struggling with their mental health.Tikaram Pun, a 40-year-old resident of Bohora village in Musikot-4, is also haunted by his past journey. In September 2017, he reached the US after crossing 17 countries with the help of organised human traffickers. Of the 41 people in his group, 31 were from Rukum East and Rukum West, he said. Pun, who was detained on arrival in the US, spent 24 months in a detention camp. His refugee application was also refused and so he was deported along with eight other Nepalis. “When I returned, I started having mental health problems. I still suffer from them,” he said. Pun is under pressure from creditors and relatives to pay back the Rs9.2 million loan he had taken for the task.Those who died on the wayA group of 10 Bangladeshis and seven Nepalis, including Rupak Bohora of Bafikot-3 in Rukum West, were on a mission to reach Costa Rica through Colombia, Caribbean Coast, Capuragana and Panama. But while they were crossing a sea, their boat capsized. As many as 12 died in the incident, including six Nepalis. Rupak’s wife, Geeta, learned about the incident only after six days, on 25 June, 2021.“I still don’t know what exactly happened,” said Geeta, who had been married off at age 19 and is now a mother of two daughters. The only thing she knows is that Rupak has died and she is now all alone. And that she has Rs5 million in loan taken for Rupak’s trip. She showed a picture of her husband on her phone to this scribe and said, “I only have memories.”Lack of political will and legal remediesThe concrete bridge over Chewang river is on the edge of Tak village. On the walls of the bridge are paintings of political theorists like Marx, Engels, Lenin, Stalin and Mao, and the iconic slogan, ‘Workers of the world, unite!’, below them. But the slogan appears to be at odds with life in the village. Given the phenomenon of illegal travels to the US through the help of organised human traffickers, the whole village appears to be emptying. Neither the local governments are concerned about the phenomenon nor are the political parties paying attention.Puniraj Gharti, chair of Putha Uttarganga Rural Municipality, said though the trend is worrying, there’s nothing he can do. “How could we stop them from making the trip when they are struggling to make a living in the village?” he said.Krishna Regmi, chair of Sisne Rural Municipality, said that the vicious cycle of poverty started after marijuana farming was banned in the country. Then the Maoist insurgency added to the woe, forcing youths to migrate. The signing of the peace agreement in 2006 didn’t herald any change in the economy either and youths are struggling to get jobs. Organised human traffickers are cashing in on this sorry state of affairs, Regmi said. “Meter byajis [usurious lenders] are also promoting this phenomenon,” he added.The phenomenon is equally rife in Dang’s Tulsipur and Ghorahi. Ramesh Kumar Pandey, chair of Ghorai-15, says that even though many heading to the US are swindled, no complaints are filed at the ward office. “Only those who attempt to go to Saudi Arabia or Qatar file the complaints,” he said.One can infer from Pandey’s statements that the families of such illegal travellers don’t want to publicise the ordeals of their family members. On the one hand, agents threaten them to not publicise the issue; on the other, they fear they themselves would be punished by law.According to the Anti-Human Trafficking Bureau, as many as 178 Nepalis, including 174 men, have been deported from the US in the five fiscal years after 2018-19. Of them, the highest 49 are from Rukum while 37 are from Dang. The data doesn’t include those who returned after making it to the half-way or those who have been fighting the legal battle in the US for refugee status. But this data is enough to show that many such youths are from the ‘base areas’ of the Maoist insurgency.SSP Jeevan Shrestha, chief of the bureau, said that data on the number of such victims and the amounts they have spent is hard to collect since complaints are rarely filed with the police. “This is human trafficking but for a lack of law, we are still compelled to launch the cases as per Human Trafficking and Transportation (Control) Act 2074 BS,” Shrestha said. “The Act provides a maximum penalty of Rs250,000 for the offenders and 50 percent of that as compensation to the victims.” Without specific law, police also invoke the theft and organised crime act to punish the offenders, he added.On the one hand, police receive no complaints; on the other, the phenomenon sees no control.Bhaskar Gautam, a political scientist, says the rise in cases of human trafficking in the insurgency’s ‘base areas’ is due to the political system’s abject failure.While the Maoists raised issues related to livelihood, nationalism and a new kind of democracy to fuel their war machine, after the peace process, it is livelihoods that have been hit the hardest, Gautam said. “The traditional way of life and economy took a hit during the insurgency,” he said. “Developments after the peace process also failed to address that. What sprang up was organised human trafficking.”(Mahesh KC in Rukum East and Durgalal KC in Dang contributed to this report.)This report is prepared in collaboration with the Center for Investigative Journalism-Nepal. \nGyanumaya BK had been suffering from severe backaches for a while. The resident of Pokhara-15, BK visited the Metrocity Hospital in Srijanachowk seeking treatment five months ago. The 69-year-old, who works as a labourer, has already spent over Rs50,000 on follow-up checkups and medications.BK spent eight days in the hospital in January and has been paying off loans she had taken to pay her bills and for follow-up visits to the hospital. Had BK been aware of the Health Facility Operation Standards-2020, which private hospitals must adhere to, she wouldn’t have had to borrow money to pay her medical bills. As per the regulations, hospitals must set aside 10 percent of their total beds to the underprivileged and needy.“I didn’t know hospitals were required to provide free treatment to those who can’t afford hospital stays,” BK said. “But even if I did, I would have to fight to get the service as the hospital won’t willingly offer me the service.”The Pokhara-based 50-bed hospital’s Chief Executive Officer Gyan Prasad Aryal admits that his hospital does not adhere to the mandate. “We don’t have explicit information from the health ministry on the Health Facility Operation Standards-2020,” said Aryal. “Moving forward, we will follow the instructions.” The hospital authorities say they give a 10-15 percent discount on the final hospital bill as opposed to dedicating 10 percent of their beds and free treatment and medications to the less privileged. Hospitals with 15 beds come under the jurisdiction of the local units while those with up to 50 beds fall under the ambit of the Provincial Health Directorate. Likewise, the Provincial Health Ministry oversees health facilities with over 50 beds.However, no regulatory body has data on whether health facilities are following government rules, especially Health Facility Operation Standards-2020. But it is an open secret that most private hospitals in Pokhara are not following the regulations.Pokhara Municipality Health Department Officer Yadunath Baral, Kaski District Health Officer Bhim Prasad Poudel, and Province Health Director Khim Bahadur Khadka all admit that local hospitals disregard the regulations. “Our monitoring and inspection is also lax, that’s why most hospitals ignore the rules,” he said. He says lack of manpower hampers effective inspection. “Our manpower is enough to conduct inspections in other districts, but not in Kaski, which has many private hospitals,” he said. “We need more people for that”. According to Baral, although the hospitals claim to offer a certain discount on final bills to the needy, they are unable to show the record of the discounts provided. “The hospitals claim they give discounts, but most hospitals have not even been able to show us the proof,” said Khadka. “Legal actions should be taken against the hospitals that fail to submit a monthly report on the free services for the poor. More importantly, they must be liable for flouting government standards that aim to benefit the poor.” The Provincial Health Directorate also does not have any data on the directive’s implementation at hospitals with more than 50 beds.The department’s chief of health services Dr Ramesh KC says that they have been working on updating information of health services in the Gandaki region. “Hospitals have failed to submit their mandatory monthly reports. We will seek that information when they come for new permits or permit renewal,” KC said. There are 27 privately-owned hospitals within the Pokhara Metropolitan City and 39 in the Gandaki region. Bharatpur Metropolitan City in Chitwan in Bagmati Province is also called the ‘medical city’  as it is home to 23 private hospitals with a total of 1,200 beds. Additionally, there are multiple large-scale government hospitals and two medical colleges—Chitwan Medical College and College of Medical Sciences—that also provide medical services. Had the Health Facility Operation Standards-2020 been followed by the 23 private hospitals, 120 patients would have received free health services every year, according to Durgadutta Chapagain, chief of the Chitwan Health Office.“Although the hospitals claim they provide the services, none have been able to provide convincing proof. Instead, we found them giving such discounts to patients who are close to hospital operators,” said Chapagain. “Our department validates the permits for new health facilities and re-registrations for hospitals with a 25-bed capacity. We have asked such public health service providers to put up posters or stickers reading ‘Discounts for the needy’ on the hospital premises so that patients know what services they can get on discount.”Meanwhile, Bikram Adhikari, Secretary of the Private Hospitals Coordination Committee in Chitwan, claims that the regulations are impractical. “There are a few services that hospitals can provide free of cost. You cannot expect hospitals to provide all services for free. That’s why there is a need to amend the existing regulations,” said Adhikari.The monitoring bodies’ inaction and lackadaisical approach to ensuring that public health services are accessible and affordable to all makes private hospitals blatantly ignore government mandates.Bharatpur Metropolitan City’s Deputy Mayor Chitrasen Adhikari says that although the metropolis is aware that private hospitals must allocate 10 percent of their beds for free treatment of poor people, the metropolis administration has yet to devise a monitoring mechanism. “We have not taken any steps towards that end, but we will soon,” he said.Just like Pokhara and Chitwan, Biratnagar is also plagued with the same problem. There are 32 private hospitals currently in operation in the metropolis. Deepak Bhattarai, statistical officer at the municipality’s health office, asserts that none of the health facilities met the set requirements. A monthly report submitted by the Biratnagar-based Nobel Medical College and Teaching Hospital, which has 750 beds, stated that the hospital had provided the said concession to more than 400 patients. “However, the report did not clarify how many of the 400 patients were provided free hospital beds and the services that come along with the beds, and how many were given discounts on their hospital bills,” Bhattarai said. “We found that hospital reports also include concessions provided to patients who sought outpatient, emergency, and X-ray services.”The hospital’s director Narayan Dahal claims to be following all government instructions. He says 10 percent hospital beds are set aside for needy patients who are not charged any treatment fees, while 10 percent of service seekers also get discounts.Although the Biratnagar Metropolis has directed all health facilities under its jurisdiction to allocate free beds and provide free services to the needy, inform service seekers about the government-provided services, and submit a list of all patients who have received the services, the directive is ignored more often than followed. According to Bhattarai, medical establishments must get a letter from the local unit before making any upgrades or purchasing any equipment. “But the hospitals have been found presenting fake documents in order to acquire such permits,” he said. “The metropolis has refused such permits to 12 private hospitals in the current fiscal year.”Butwal Sub-Metropolitan City in the Lumbini Province has also taken no concrete step to ensure private hospitals adhere to Health Facility Operation Standards-2020. Despite having the authority to carry out inspections, the sub-metropolis’ apathy has deprived hundreds of needy patients of various government services. The sub-metropolis with 17 wards has more than two dozen big hospitals in the Butwal bazaar area itself. Not one of them adheres to the government’s health regulations. But the sub-metropolis is yet to monitor these hospitals. Yubraj Pandey, chief of Butwal Sub Metropolitan’s health department, says they have been unable to inspect medical institutes due to a lack of a proper set of rules.“I have just been transferred here. Discussions are underway to prepare legal requirements,” he said. Private hospitals in Butwal only began filing their reports two months ago after a joint meeting, informs Chief of the Sub Metropolitan’s Education and Health Department Mitramani Khanal. Twenty-year-old Suraj BK of Sarawal Rural Municipality-2 in West Nawalparasi got into a motorcycle accident on April 26. He suffered injuries on both his legs and was taken to Zenus Hospital and Research Centre in Butwal. Suraj was handed a bill of Rs 70,000 for treatment but he did not have the money to clear the bill and sought the hospital’s help. “The hospital refused to provide any discount. They in fact refused to discharge me. I got my discharge papers only four days later after I paid almost Rs 100,000,” he said. “I had to get a loan to pay the hospital bills as my father, who is a farmer, did not have that kind of money.”Dr Sharda Singh, the hospital director, said Suraj did not qualify for a discount as he did not have a recommendation letter from the local unit. “Patients have to get a recommendation to avail of free services at private hospitals but Suraj could not bring one,” she said. “I was in the hospital bed for four days. I could not have secured a recommendation from the local unit in that state,” said Suraj. Ishwari Prasad Chapagain, a civil society leader of Rupandehi and a member of the Consumer Interest Protection Forum, says private hospitals in Butwal are more interested in making money than helping those in need. “They do not follow government mandates. They act as if they have to bear the expenses of providing free service to the poor when in fact they get tax rebates and such for such services,” he said. “The sub-metropolis also does not do the needful. Everyone is corrupt including the city officials.”  \nDuring my recent visit to Bajura District, I explored olive farming and witnessed its current state in the region. My interaction with Janesh Bhandari, a local civic campaigner, revealed the unfortunate stagnation of a once-promising project. Funded by the Italian government with approximately 1.4 million Euros allocated for Kathmandu, Dolpa and Bajura, this project saw half of the funds directed to Bajura alone. Preliminary research identified that out of 28 species planted, 24 bore fruit, and 10 were recommended for Nepal.Following the success of the pilot study, the Government of Nepal (GoN) has designated Bajura, encompassing the municipalities of Jagannath, Himali, Swamikartik and Budhinanda, as an olive zone. In 2016, an Olive Zone Implementation Unit was established under the Prime Minister Agriculture Modernisation (2015-25) Project. The main goal of this unit is to promote commercial olive farming and enhance the management and utilisation of natural olive forests to increase farmers’ incomes. Despite such significant investment in research, commercial olive farming remains unfruitful, owing to several challenges.ProspectsEmpirical evidence suggests that olive farming in Bajura could serve as a nature-based solution to diversify the local production system. Investing in both wild and domesticated olives could boost household incomes and generate employment in the region. Given the environmental, social and economic benefits, olive cultivation could enhance the resilience and well-being of smallholding farmers. Research also highlights olive as a crop with a high potential for income, employment opportunities and improvement in economic status.Olive oil is a common product in Nepal, but olive wood handicrafts are globally popular. Handicraft items from olive wood fetch high prices, including wooden bowls and plates, which sell at a range of $20-70. Olive oil is also used in producing soaps, scents, skincare and other cosmetics. Nepal imported olive products worth $616,217 in 2022, which shows a year-on-year value growth of 70.38 percent. With olive oil prices in the Nepali market ranging from Rs2,000 to 3,000 per litre, the market potential for olive oil and its diversified products is substantial, making systematic cultivation a promising avenue for import substitution. The Prime Minister's Agriculture Modernisation Project has initiated a programme to construct infrastructure for olive farming and provide relief of Rs427,000 for 2,386 farmers in Bajura.ChallengesDespite Bajura being designated as an olive production zone, several challenges hinder the commercial farming of olives. One major issue is the underutilisation of wild olives due to the lack of collection and processing centres. In addition to these, another challenge was the lack of a three-phase electricity line essential for the production centre's operation, rendering the plant dysfunctional at the moment.Additionally, there is a significant mindset barrier among farmers and local people. Olive trees take five years to bear fruit, and most farmers attracted to faster-yielding crops like apples are reluctant to invest in olive cultivation. The farmers’ economic status exacerbates this reluctance, as they cannot afford to wait for such a long harvest period.Another challenge is the lack of a technically skilled workforce. Some farmers have fallen short of the necessary knowledge about olive cultivation and its benefits, and others have shifted to high-value crops, abandoning traditional farming practices in the region. Educating them about the economic and health benefits of olive farming could prove beneficial. Policy measuresNepal can draw inspiration from Rajasthan, India, where the government actively promoted olive cultivation by introducing Israeli technology and operational models. The Government of India included olives under the national mission on oilseeds and oil palm. After eight years of nurturing olive saplings, this led to the successful launch of Rajasthan's first indigenous olive oil brand. Similarly, Pakistan has seen impressive success in olive farming. In 2022, the country exported virgin and extra virgin olive oil worth $1.9 million. This achievement was enabled by a project launched in 2012 by the Pakistani government, in cooperation with the Italian government, called \"Promotion of Olive Cultivation for Economic Development and Poverty Alleviation\". This project, run through the Pakistan Agriculture Research Council (PARC), has provided Pakistani farmers with training on pruning techniques and technological support. As a result, Italy and Pakistan now enjoy an annual trade relationship worth €2 billion.With the government initiating an olive zone, it is now crucial for local authorities to take ownership of the project and explore the commercial viability of olive oil extraction. Currently, only a few informed individuals at the policy level are aware of the prospects. Disseminating information to local farmers and communities is imperative, as olive is not a part of Nepal's traditional lifestyle and food habits. The government should implement policy measures such as incorporating olive farming into the curriculum of universities and schools. Agricultural universities should encourage students to intern in olive farming regions for practical experience.Once commercial farming is established, Nepal should register with the International Olive Council to gain wider recognition. Agricultural documents should highlight olives as prospective crops, and proper national records should be maintained on the status of wild and commercially farmed olives. Additionally, it is essential to have trained technicians and experts to oversee olive cultivation and farming. With coordinated action from the government, local officials, farmers and other key stakeholders, olive cultivation could become a lucrative endeavour in Nepal. This could help diversify the country's agriculture sector and foster economic development. \nAs temperatures rise, cities across the globe face the threat of extreme heat. Between 2002 and 2010, Nepal had more than two dozen destructive heatwaves, with the most severe occurring in 2009 and 2010, leading to 25 deaths and affecting 280 individuals. Alarmingly, about 80 percent of Nepal’s population is at risk from natural and climate-induced hazards like heat waves.Cities suffer more from heat waves for a few reasons. First is the urban heat island effect, where cities get hotter than villages. This happens because cities are cramped with people, buildings and infrastructure that absorb and retain heat. So, urban centres remain hot even at night when things should cool down, creating a hot bubble over the city that is several degrees warmer than outside. In particular, Kathmandu’s built-up area is almost four times what it was in the mid-1980s. Also, everything we do in cities, like running air conditioners, driving vehicles, working in factories and doing industrial activities, creates even more heat.Additionally, urban centres lack trees or open water bodies to cool things down naturally. This puts city dwellers, especially older people and those with health issues or limited resources, at risk. Addressing these challenges requires innovative urban planning and integrated green infrastructure.Growing threatNepal is witnessing a rise in both the frequency and intensity of heat waves, particularly in cities. The Ministry of Health and Population recently urged the public to take preventive measures against heat waves. The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) reports that the impact of heat waves became more severe in 2023, making life increasingly difficult. A study by the Department of Hydrology and Meteorology (DHM), Government of Nepal, 2017 showed that Nepal’s average maximum temperature has risen by 0.056 degrees Celsius, with most places getting hotter yearly.Heat is causing major problems, especially for the poor and underprivileged. High temperatures contribute to drought, forest fires and floods, posing serious threats to human health, lives and the nation’s economy. For instance, on April 19, 2023, there were more than 2,800 forest fires in Nepal in a single day. Following the massive forest fire across the country, Kathmandu became one of the world's most polluted cities, according to the Air Quality Index. Also, this year, over 4,500 wildfires have been reported in the country, almost double last year's, mostly because it’s getting hotter. These heatwaves don’t just hurt people right away. Being out in the heat for a long time can cause serious health problems and chronic conditions, such as cardiovascular and respiratory diseases. Feeling tired, dizzy, thirsty, headaches, leg cramps, muscle pain, vomiting, dizziness and fainting are immediate signs of too much exposure to excessive heat. Heat-related severe illnesses like heat stroke need immediate medical attention, and this puts more pressure on healthcare systems. The economic cost is significant, too, with damage to infrastructure, reduced productivity and increased energy demands for cooling.Recent findingsA recent study in the Theoretical and Applied Climatology journal examines the spatiotemporal characterisation of heatwaves in Kathmandu. It develops a methodological framework and suggests ways to lessen the heat impacts. Utilising satellite-based data, essential for developing countries like Nepal where adequate measuring stations are lacking, the study shows that higher temperatures are concentrated in valleys with high population densities. It is high time we took appropriate mitigation measures in urban planning, building infrastructure and at the household and community levels. The study also highlights a notable rise in extreme heatwave conditions, especially from 2012 onwards. A significant urban warming trend, primarily observed in densely populated regions, suggests that the elderly and youth with limited capacities are highly vulnerable to extreme heat. Mitigation strategiesCities need to plan better and include more green spaces to deal with the growing risk of heatwaves. We must figure out how much cooler and to what spatial extent parks, ponds and forests serve effectively. By optimising the design, distribution and maintenance of green infrastructure, cities can use nature to cool things down and make cities resilient. Parks and gardens don’t just provide shade; they also cool things by letting water evaporate from plants and water bodies. Another strategy involves using appropriate construction materials, such as cool roofs and pavements. Vegetation-covered green roofs can also help keep buildings cooler.Policy implicationsPolicies encouraging the adoption of green infrastructure, regulations on urban heat management and incentives for buildings using cool roofing materials can make a significant difference. Public awareness campaigns are also crucial. We must teach everyone about why green infrastructure is good and ways to stay safe in the heat, like drinking enough water and not toiling too much outside when it is super hot.The escalating threat of heatwaves in Nepal’s cities demands immediate and innovative action. Integrating green spaces, water bodies, and other natural elements into urban design is not just an option anymore—we must make cities good places for the next generation to live. The future of city life in a warming world depends on our ability to innovate and adapt. It is high time to make our cities that withstand the challenges of climate change and be great places to live. It’s a job for everyone—governments, city planners and people from all walks of life—to work together to make cities cooler. \nNepal faced economic challenges while other countries embraced participatory budgeting initiatives to empower citizens in budget allocation, highlighting the need for Nepal to embrace participatory budgeting for greater transparency and accountability.\nOver half of Nepal's SEE examinees fail, highlighting the education system's deep-seated flaws, despite a grading system implemented in 2016.\nAfter 14 years of asylum, imprisonment, and legal battles, WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange is released after pleading guilty to conspiring to obtain classified documents, while WikiLeaks' revelations and the ensuing backlash against Assange and the free press continue to raise concerns about the suppression of dissent globally.\nIllegal road building and river extraction in Nepal damage sensitive areas, posing risks to the environment, wildlife, and humans, despite laws and government apathy.\nOver 52% of students failed SEE due to teacher underperformance, poor grading system implementation, and lack of infrastructure despite the introduction of a letter grading system intended to align with international standards.\nFollowing Ambassador recalls from 11 countries, Nepal's Prime Minister Dahal's visit to New Delhi yielded bilateral progress, including energy trade, connectivity, and investment advancements, while BRI projects and trade agreements with China face delays.\nThe government has decided to make the National ID Card mandatory in order to receive services from government and public institutions.

Citizenship establishes whether you are a citizen of the country and it helps you identify yourself with some basic details. In Nepal, it was also widely used as a service card. Wherever you go, you have to show the citizenship card—to open a bank account or acquire a SIM card for a phone. If we study international practices, there are mainly two cards—one is an identity card and the other is a service card. In 2018, the Nepal government came up with the idea of distributing national identity cards with a unique digital number for each eligible citizen. The number can track not only the individual but also the person’s activities and movements. This project has various components. First is data collection. It has two categories—demographic data, such as the names of father, mother and other family members. Second is biometric data—fingerprints, eye retina and digital signature. The biometric data is crucial to create a unique identity of each individual and avoid duplication in the integrated national database. The National ID has these two types of data. The other tasks are enrollment of the data, printing and distribution of the cards and then providing services based on that. At present, people carry multiple cards in their pockets. The objective of this project is to replace all of them by a single card–National ID. The new card includes vital details of all other cards in its chip with 1GB storage capacity. The government wanted to trace people based on their unique individual numbers so that there is no need to print and carry multiple cards. There is a huge industry of printing separate cards for each and every service that is creating a jumble of information. The National ID will not only replace multiple cards but also help authorities control criminal activities like financial frauds by removing duplication. At present, government authorities have difficulty in tracing and identifying an individual and wrongdoers are benefitting from that situation.What cards will be replaced by the National ID?It has a chip with 1GB storage capacity where you can store your driving license, academic documents, voting card, insurance details, ATM card number, etc. For instance, if you go to a telecom company to acquire a SIM card, they will ask for a copy of your citizenship card. You can say, ‘no, I have a National ID card’. Once you give your number and fingerprint, they can immediately verify it through the system. Another objective is to help people get rid of filling up pages of forms for each service. International governance has a norm that says don’t ask citizens their information more than once. A state agency should seek the information once and provide it to other state agencies if they require it. People complain that many agencies don’t accept National ID. They still ask for a citizenship card for official record and verification. So, in practice, it didn’t help people reduce the number of cards in their pockets. In fact, it added one more.Therefore, the June 6 Cabinet decision made the use of National ID cards compulsory in 28 districts. Now, it is going to be essential to get social security allowances, pensions and claim health insurance. The Health Insurance Board has said it has become challenging for them to verify whether a claimant is the rightful one. The board has 8 million policyholders. We will give them our details. Then, they can cross-check the authenticity of a claimant. This will help avoid huge financial frauds. In fact, the government should have made it mandatory earlier.But people including lawmakers in the federal parliament have strongly opposed the decision saying that the government made National ID mandatory without first distributing the cards to the people.Nepal’s total population is over 30 million. Our principal stakeholders are citizenship card holders. Those 16-year-olds are eligible for citizenship cards. The Election Commission distributes voting cards to those above 18 years. We got the data from the commission and added 20 percent and estimated that we have 18.6 people above 16 years old. As of Friday, we have already distributed the National ID numbers to 14.9 million people. Now, as per our estimate, around 3.7 million people are yet to get the National ID. Millions of people are abroad. Thus, we are headed towards saturation point in terms of data collection and issuance of the numbers. One thing I want to stress is that people don’t need a hard copy of the National ID card. The number is sufficient. Printing cards is costly. We have to pay around 2 euro to procure a blank card. The cost of printing, delivery and other overhead expenses is added to that. With the task of printing over a billion copies of ID cards being too costly, even India discourages use of hard copy of the cards. You can create the QR code of your card, save it in your mobile or print it in a paper and scan it wherever you need it.Officials at our government agencies bring up the rule that makes it mandatory to present a physical copy of citizenship card or other documents for official works.Yes, we are trained and habituated in that way. Now we need to change. We must make offices paperless while developing a strong database system. We have been using citizenship cards to verify the identity of a person for a long time. Biometrics not only helps identify people but also trace their activities. Recently, Rs2 billion was found in the bank accounts of a 26-year-old man. The money was deposited in 56 bank accounts. He used 13 ATM cards and 17 phone numbers. Once the National ID card is implemented, transactions and movements of such wrongdoers will be easily traced and monitored. Identifying individuals accurately is crucial to ensure good governance and strengthen security. Many people have acquired fake citizenship cards. People even made fake passports. Implementation of National ID will control it. It is also related to our national image. It will help improve the status of our passport and add authenticity to our other documents as well.Once the National ID comes into wide use, our details will be traced and used by multiple agencies. State agencies and other institutions benefit from the integrated database as they can easily trace us. But how do you ensure our data isn’t misused and it doesn’t make us insecure?If you have a National ID card, you don’t need a hard copy of your driving licence. There is a backlog of around 2.1 million licences. The government has failed to print and distribute them. We told them, we have already procured 12 million cards. Of them, 3.2 million cards have already been printed and we still need to print around 8 million cards. Once the licence data is integrated with the National ID card, it will be shown there. Now, to come to your question, only the traffic authority can access the licence-related data. The device they use will trace only relevant data. Only an authorised agency will get access to the data and it can’t be used for anything other than the stated purpose. We give access to agencies like Nepal Rastra Bank, Nepal Telecommunication Authority and Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal. Then they regulate the things in their domain. No unauthorised body or individual can access it. Do the implementing agencies have infrastructure to use this technology?We are in a position to implement it in some parts of the country. Therefore, we are implementing it in phases. We are making it mandatory for certain services in 28 districts from mid-July. We should have started much earlier. It must be expedited.Lawmakers said in a Parliament meeting that the decision has ‘terrorised people’ in the 28 districts as locals feared they might be deprived of the services as the government has made National ID cards mandatory without first distributing them.We started the National ID registration process from 2018. Registration teams reached in each local ward except in Mugu and Humla districts of Karnali. It was carried out as a campaign. Even after the drive’s completion, the registration process was open in all the 77 districts, 54 area administration offices and in palika (local unit) centres. We also had registration centres in major downtowns. We receive data of around 4,000 registrations a day. So, there has been sufficient initiative and enough time to encourage people to get the number. Besides, if anyone in the 28 districts are still to get the ID number, they still have three months to register.You said only an ID number but no hard copy was needed to access any kind of service, right?Exactly. There is no provision that states one should produce a hard copy to get any service. You give the number and your biometrics to verify that you are the right person. Then, the official can crosscheck it in the database within seconds.Do all the implementing agencies have the devices that read the National ID cards?We have distributed 4,200 machines that read the cards in 333 local units of the 28 districts. Likewise, we have asked other local units and districts and some agencies such as banks to procure the devices and we have given the specifications based on their requirements. A device costs just around Rs 1,500. You can enter the number and place your thumbprint on it. We have trained relevant officials from all the local units for the purpose.How many cards can the department print at present?We can produce 1,500 cards an hour. But now we are producing only 1,800 a day. We have the strength to distribute 30,000 cards a day but are distributing only 5,000 a day.Again the same question. Then why are people not getting the cards?There is some communication gap. People who registered in 2018 or 2019 haven’t contacted us. We are giving them priority to clear the backlogs. But people who are newly-registered are showing more interest. So, we need to strike the right balance.When will the department be in a position to distribute the cards to all the people?At present, we can print 100,000 cards a month. We have a space to double the capacity. Meanwhile, people have now shown more interest. By enhancing our facilities’ capacity, we can print the pending 8 million cards in the next 40 months.What about election cards? Do we need to register for that and get the voting cards?In fact, the Election Commission doesn’t need to collect data and issue cards. We will talk to them. As a constitutional body, we have to readily make the data available for them. In fact, the National ID Card system can help the commission make voting arrangements for the Nepalis abroad because it can accurately identify the right person and can immediately update the integrated system here in Nepal about the votes cast in any country. This card will be helpful in conducting fair elections because the biometric data stored in this system will be perfect bases to identify the people and instantly update the activities in the database.You have emphasised replacement of other cards by the National ID cards. How long may it take to do so?We plan on giving priority to three sectors—banking, civil aviation and telecom. People right now need to fill separate forms for these services that have irked the service seekers. We have asked the bankers to buy the devices. We as a supplier are ready. Now the stakeholders should be ready too. It will benefit them because it helps control frauds.What if I don’t register for the National ID card?In the first place, you will be deprived of social security funds, pension, insurance policies. Likewise, the government will gradually make the card compulsory to receive many other services such as driving licence, land transaction, telephone numbers, bank accounts. How do you assure that our data stored in this system isn’t misused?See, the current practices make you more vulnerable. Because multiple agencies take your data for various purposes. Do they have a system to protect the data and ensure that it isn’t misused? But when your data is stored only by a dedicated government agency, it will be more secure as the agency is specialised for that. When other authorised agencies seek data, we give them access only to the relevant one. We have a National Identity Management Information System (NIMIS). We have maintained three layers of security—L1, L2, L3—to ensure foolproof security of the data. There are three servers.Are we dependent on any foreign company for any related service?So far, only one international vendor is involved but we are cutting down its involvement as well, with a plan to ultimately replace it by our own agency. The vendor now helps transfer collected data to the printing machine through the Automated Biometric Identification System (ABIS). But our plan is to do so through our own government agency or local vendor. We do all the other tasks. Security printing is done within the office basement where every movement of people is monitored and recorded. \nPrithvi Subba Gurung, deputy general secretary of the CPN-UML, is one of the leaders who strongly lobbied for a federal system while the Constituent Assembly was writing the constitution between 2008 to 2015. Eight years after the adoption of the federal democratic republican constitution, the federal system, particularly the provinces, are widely being criticised for their supposed failure to deliver. The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal asks former Gandaki chief minister Gurung what went wrong in the course of implementing the federal system.The implementation of the federal system has faced several hurdles since its adoption. Most provinces have for months failed even to form the governments, let alone run them efficiently. Where is the problem?We have adopted a federal system but are working against its spirit. Provinces should run autonomously. On some key issues, federal leaders and the party’s central bodies may give some direction to their provincial bodies. But most provincial activities are still centrally-governed even years after the adoption of federalism. So, our practices aren’t in line with the system. The provincial governments shouldn’t have been affected by the changes in the federal coalition. Such problems were seen in India years ago. But they have learned from their experience. In our case, leaders of major political parties treated the provincial governments as party chapters. The provincial governments are formed and run as per the constitution and all the three tiers of the governments are autonomous. The high commands in our political parties aren’t ready to accept the new constitutional setup.Are the provincial leaders equally responsible as they seek Kathmandu’s nod before taking any important decisions?They seek the centre’s support because they are trained in that way. They are too dependent on the centre. You said India learned by experience and now provinces there work more autonomously. But, in Nepal, provinces are now witnessing more problems than during their first tenure, which is evident also in the difficulties in government formation in multiple provinces. Why couldn’t they learn from the five-year experience?Nepal’s leaders and political parties are still not committed to federalism. They have failed to implement the federal system as per the spirit of the constitution. This is the major problem. The big parties as well as their leaders are guided by a centralised mindset and still prefer working in a unitary system. We should not forget that we transformed the executive and legislative bodies into three tiers of federal systems. But our judiciary retained the old structure. Therefore, the judiciary doesn’t accept the federal system and its practice in a true sense. Its verdicts reflect the same.The role of Speakers and Province Heads has courted controversies in multiple provinces. The top court invalidated some of their decisions. Is it because of lack of clarity, faults in our constitutional provisions, or is it because of the leaders?Speaker and Province Head are political posts created in accordance with constitutional provisions. When overall politics is dirty and unhealthy, those taking up these responsibilities also feel compelled to resort to similar tactics. When overall politics improves, they automatically make better decisions. Mainly there is no leader in the high command who completely owns federalism and is determined to implement it in its true spirit. This government in its policies and programmes unveiled last month had rightly said that “protecting federalism and strengthening the federal democratic republic is our top priority”. But the budget failed to introduce programmes as per the promises made in the policies and programmes.How do we correct these anomalies? Where do we begin?We are in a complex situation. Many have started to float the idea of making amendments to the constitution. But we shouldn’t forget that various forces and stakeholders had their own positions during constitution-making. They made compromises and found middle grounds to promulgate the constitution. If we go for amendments, they all will return to their respective stances. Some may want to revive the Hindu Kingdom while others will stand against it. Some leaders even within Nepali Congress have started to advocate for constitutional monarchy. But we can’t regress to the monarchical system. We can’t renounce secularism and an inclusive democratic system. We can’t backtrack on our commitment to a socialism-oriented system. We may explore some changes in our electoral system or form of governance without going against these key features of our constitution but we can’t destabilise the charter. What are the major flaws to be fixed?There are some. For instance, provinces have no role in education. The responsibility of education up to secondary level is given to the local level. And, everything is controlled by the federal government. The local units are entrusted with key responsibilities such as developing curriculum, overseeing the issues of career developments of teachers and staffers and their promotion as well as transfers etcetera. Local units can’t do all of these things efficiently as they have their own limitations. How can a local unit transfer a teacher from Kaski to Lamjung? Provinces should have been given such responsibilities. The power has been centralised at Singha Durbar. Such is also the situation in other sectors.Though the proportional representation (PR) system is hailed as one of the most beautiful features of our constitution in terms of ensuring inclusion, it has also been blamed for political instability. Many have demanded revision in the electoral system.The major political parties such as the CPN-UML and Nepali Congress have not trained their party members on the proper implementation of key constitutional features such as federalism and electoral system. The party members and general people have either wrongly understood it, or have negative impressions about the systems. These systems were adopted with an objective to resolve our decade-long conflict and address the concerns of the historically marginalised communities and even mainstream some groups through an inclusive democratic system. The idea was to integrate all the communities and maintain unity in diversity. After holding years-long debates on various options, we agreed on the mixed electoral system so as to reflect our diversity in the state agencies.As the proverb goes, “the bad workman blames his tools”, our leaders are blaming the system for their failure to secure a majority by winning people’s trust. Many countries that practise similar electoral systems have progressed. Our electoral system and the form of governance are not causing political instability. Many countries have adopted a parliamentary system and many others have practised the presidential model. Countries have progressed in both the systems. Also, there are examples of failures under both setups. So, the problem lies in our political parties and leaders, not in the systems. Shouldn’t political parties like the UML and Congress work with a plan to secure a majority by winning people’s trust? They aren’t training their focus on that but blaming the system. At times, they have squandered the majority as well and have failed to keep the party intact. Isn’t it our [leaders’] failure?Some argue that the issue of the fractured mandate can be addressed by increasing the threshold ceiling for political parties to be eligible to get PR votes and that can be done by amending election laws. Does it help?This is the idea coming from big political parties because they get more votes when fringe parties disqualify for PR votes. But a higher ceiling may deprive many small parties from representing certain communities. So, this goes against the spirit of inclusion. What we need is a good coalition culture. If we see the trend of recent decades, Indian politicians have become much more mature in this context. In the past, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi accommodated his electoral alliance partners in his ruling coalition even though his party won the majority single-handedly. If we scrap the inclusive electoral system, won’t the marginalised communities again revolt? We should be careful about that.At times, leaders have helped dissident groups split their party. These are the same leaders who issued an ordinance to change the provision that required a group within a political party to show support of 40 percent members of the party’s central committee “and” the parliamentary party. Only then could it split. They changed the threshold to 20 percent, and the “and” provision had been changed to “or”. The provision of requiring 40 percent support on both sides had earlier been included to ensure political stability. But the leaders who are helping party divisions are blaming the system for instability in the country. So, we [leaders] have to mend our ways, not blame the system. The Rastriya Swantantra Party, the fourth-largest in the lower house, has officially said that it wants to overhaul the federal system and drastically downsize the provinces. Also, leaders within the major parties who earlier stood in favour of federalism have started criticising it. On Saturday, Congress General Secretary Gagan Thapa said the country can’t sustain the provinces in their present form. What is your view?I am one of those who advocated for a federal system even before the first Constituent Assembly because Nepal is a country full of discrimination based on caste, class, region and religion. We advocated for the system to do away with these discriminations and find a system to maintain unity within diversity. Federalism is the best system to promote national unity as all groups get their own space as per their unique features. For instance, if you make multiple rooms in a building, you can give space and adjust more people. But if you keep many people inside a big room, they will have difficulties—no matter how big the room is. We should strengthen the federal system. We can’t regress.Then, why do many people see provinces as a burden?In Nepal, the federal system was projected as a structure that resulted in huge liability to the state coffers. But the facts don’t substantiate it. A local unit in the federal structure replaced many erstwhile Village Development Committees (VDCs). For instance, in my home district of Lamjung, eight palikas covered the areas of 61 VDCs, and the expenditure of the current eight local units is no more than that of the erstwhile 61 VDCs. Now we don’t need 77 district coordination committees. They can be scrapped. No province needs more than seven ministers. Likewise, the federal Cabinet can be drastically downsized. Why do we need a 25-strong Cabinet at the centre when we already have seven other provincial cabinets? Twelve ministries are enough at the centre, as suggested by the high level commission on administration reform.There are many departments and divisions that were designed under the unitary system that have become completely redundant in the federal setup. So many project offices established over two decades ago based on the needs of that time are still there. These irrelevant bodies should be scrapped. This is how we can significantly cut down on administrative costs. Leaders and people don’t discuss that. They only blame provinces. \nLawmaker Jiban Pariyar, a joint general secretary of the Nepali Congress, the main opposition, was a member of the four-member taskforce that prepared the terms of reference (ToR) of the parliamentary committee to probe the cooperative scam. The taskforce finalised it after a prolonged dispute over whether to categorically mention Deputy Prime Minister and Home Minister Rabi Lamichhane’s name while defining the committee’s jurisdiction. The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal talked to him about the ToR finalisation process and other aspects of the probe. It took weeks to finalise the ToR and jurisdiction of the parliamentary committee formed to probe the cooperative scam. How did you finally reach an agreement? I will give a brief context first. Cases of cooperative frauds had been made public even in the past. But this time, some groups and gangs were seen to be working in an organised way to embezzle billions of rupees deposited by common people. Some established people, including those active in politics, were found to be misusing the people’s hard-earned money. This issue was thus urgent and our party Nepali Congress raised it strongly in Parliament. We had raised this issue even when we were in the government [before March 4]. We had raised it with erstwhile home minister Narayankaji Shrestha in parliamentary committees and other platforms. We had talked to him about the involvement of lawmakers and other politicians in such scams.But the Congress raised this issue more strongly after the party quit the government.This is true, and for a good reason. We demanded a parliamentary committee to probe this issue after our party’s exit from the government because Rabi Lamichhane, someone linked with some big cooperative scams, became home minister. We raised this issue after he was allowed to lead the same ministry and police agencies that were supposed to be investigating the scams. Earlier, various agencies within Nepal Police and other government bodies were looking into the matter. Erstwhile home minister Shrestha had assured us of an independent and fair investigation. Lamichhane transferred police officials who were investigating the scams, and tried to protect cooperative operators involved in wrongdoing. Based on all these activities, we concluded that a parliamentary probe committee is a must and we firmly stood for the same. Initially, we raised this issue in Parliament without obstructing House proceedings but the government compelled us to disrupt the meetings after it refused to address our concerns. The prime minister tried to give Lamichhane a clean chit by saying that he was not involved in the cooperative scams. Also, the Nepal Police chief at a parliamentary committee meeting said that the home minister wasn’t under investigation as he had done nothing wrong. In the meantime, the attorney general issued a letter stating that no cooperative-related case was registered against Lamichhane. It became clear that the government agencies wouldn’t investigate the issue independently. Then, we raised the issue strongly and we even had to obstruct Parliament meetings. After the pressure, top leaders from the ruling as well as opposition parties agreed to form a parliamentary committee to investigate the matter. The leaders formed a task force led by Law, Justice and Parliamentary Affairs Minister Padam Giri and entrusted us with preparing the committee’s ToR and defining its jurisdiction.But at the task force meetings, members from the ruling parties lobbied to define the committee’s jurisdiction in a way that only allowed for investigation into the wrongdoings of cooperatives and their operators but not those involved in syphoning money from there through illegal means. They argued that only those who issued the loans should be made liable, not those who obtained it. Their intent was to protect Rabi Lamichhane. But I insisted that our duty is to find where the common people’s money has been spent or misused and then to return the money to the depositors. I insisted on investigating Lamichhane as various studies have shown his involvement in the misuse of depositors’ money.Then, we started exchanging written proposals. We exchanged and discussed many such proposals in writing. We insisted on mentioning the names of Lamichhane and the Gorkha Media Network—where Lamichhane and GB Rai invested tens of millions of cooperatives’ money—and ensuring that the depositors get their money back. After a long negotiation, members from the UML became a bit flexible. But the Rastriya Swatantra Party of Lamichhane continued to be rigid. Then, we finally agreed to mention the names of the cooperatives from where Lamichhane and his former colleagues had obtained money and to name Gorkha Media Network but not Lamichhane.But won’t keeping out the name of the sitting home minister create more confusion and disputes?There is no need to be confused. The ToR has stated the name of Gorkha Media Network, where Lamichhane and his team invested the money they got from the cooperatives, and the ToR’s Annex-2 has a list of cooperatives from where they obtained the money. It has also stated that “responsible officials of the company” involved in such transactions would also be investigated. Even other firms and individuals linked to the transactions will be probed. So there is no chance of keeping Lamichhane away from investigation. The committee’s jurisdiction defined in the ToR is clear on this.Will your party ask for Lamichhane’s resignation after the committee starts investigating him?Our party is yet to formally demand the home minister’s resignation. But questions have been raised about him in Parliament, in various public platforms and in the media. Also, the general public has raised this issue. He knows the committee will summon him for interrogation. A few months ago, when a minister [from Congress] was summoned by the Commission for Investigation of Abuse of Authority, Lamichhane was the one who strongly demanded the minister’s resignation in Parliament. He will soon face the parliamentary inquiry committee. Let’s see how he faces it. Leaders from ruling parties including the prime minister have accused the Congress of personally targeting Lamichhane after he refused to join a Congress-led coalition in which he was offered the prime ministerial position.Leaders from new parties should understand that political leaders engage in dialogue with all political forces. Some meetings are convened in a strategic way. This is natural in a democracy. Also, Lamichhane met with our party president. But they spread a rumour that our party president offered him the prime ministerial position. That’s not true. The argument that we targeted him after he refused to join our coalition is baseless. The Congress has officially decided that the probe committee can investigate any of our members suspected of wrongdoings. Has any other party made such a decision officially? We have also officially challenged the home minister to prove the allegations he labelled at our party leaders from Parliament’s rostrum. We have also challenged him to investigate and prove the charges.When the names of head and members of the parliamentary probe committee became public, many thought that the parties didn’t give due importance to the panel as they nominated relatively low-profile lawmakers. Why didn’t the parties choose powerful leaders to investigate a national crisis of this magnitude?This is a wrong perception. All members are federal parliamentarians. They shouldn’t be judged based on their personalities and profiles. The committee is powerful because it has a mandate from the House, and its jurisdiction and the ToR give it power. What we should carefully follow is their work. They can invite experts and specialists—such as chartered accountants, bankers, account specialists—if they require technical expertise during the investigation.Lamichhane himself is chair of the fourth-largest party, which has a decisive role in the ruling coalition. Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal and CPN-UML chair KP Sharma Oli had initially ruled out any need of investigation into the home minister. In this context, can the committee members freely conduct the investigation?I am confident that even the committee member from the RSP can’t defend his leader when the documents and facts show that the money was illegally released. How can other members protect him? I believe they will conduct the investigation independently and come up with a consensus report. Documents, facts and figures guide investigation. This isn’t like leaders giving statements on public platforms. We are not saying he must be proven guilty as the Congress has blamed him. He may prove to be innocent after investigation. We should accept if the evidence proves Lamichhane innocent. The bottom line is that the investigation should be fair. Many Congress leaders are also involved in cooperative scams and other corruption cases. So people suspect that leaders will eventually trade off and the probe panel will be only an eyewash.This investigation cannot be weakened under any pretext. I am saying this based on the documents and evidence I have studied. Also, the media and other stakeholders such as the study report of Pokhara Metropolitan City and the investigation report of Rupandehi District Police, among others, have already made ample evidence public. It’s not easy to acquit the guilty.What will Congress’ approach be if the committee, where ruling parties have a majority, fails to decide by consensus and members take decisions on a majority basis?In the seven-member panel, there are two members from our party and one from the Rastriya Prajatantra Party. If those from the ruling parties pushed for a wrong decision based on their majority, members from opposition parties will counter that and register their differing views. If such a situation arises they will be free to make the reality public and they can even bring out a different report.Was Congress under pressure to reach an agreement as there were reports that the government was preparing to unveil the budget through ordinance citing opposition’s House obstruction?We weren’t worried about that. In fact, the prime minister’s initiatives and his seriousness to end the House deadlock played a crucial role in helping us reach this agreement. \nThe weather across the country will be generally to mostly cloudy on Monday.
