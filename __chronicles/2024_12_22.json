Write it in the form of inspiring story not news article or event.\n    \n    Story:\nOnce upon a time, nestled between the towering peaks of the Himalayas and the lush jungles of the Terai, there was a country named Nepal. Though still a developing nation, Nepal was a land of profound beauty and deep-rooted cultural heritage. The residents of Nepal faced many challenges, but beneath these hardships lay a resilient spirit and an unyielding hope for the future.\n\nThis enchanting land, where Mount Everest reaches towards the skies and the air carries a mix of incense and cool mountain breezes, was more than a geographical marvel. It was a mosaic of cultures, languages, and traditions, a testament to human endeavor against all odds. Nepal's history, from the unification under King Prithvi Narayan Shah to its transformation into a federal democratic republic, told a story of aspiration and endurance.\n\nIn recent years, the people of Nepal, with their indomitable will, had taken strides towards rebuilding and reimagining their country. They turned their struggles into stepping stones, each challenge a chapter in their ongoing saga. The shift from a monarchy to a republic had not only changed governance but had woven a new tapestry of democratic values and collective decision-making.\n\nEconomically, while agriculture continued to sustain a large part of its population, Nepal had begun to harness the potential of its picturesque landscapes, developing sustainable tourism that promised to preserve their natural heritage while boosting local economies. Communities living in the shadows of the Himalayas had become stewards of the earth, protecting the biodiversity that made their country unique.\n\nEach day brought new stories. Whether it was a festival in Kathmandu, a technological advance in Pokhara, or a conservation effort in Chitwan, these events were threads in the vibrant quilt of Nepali life. These stories, updated daily, reflected the pulse of progress and the spirit of hope that characterized this resilient nation.\n\nAnd so, as Nepal moved forward, each moment was not just a passage of time but a promise of potential, a narrative of a nation perennially climbing towards tomorrow, guided by the legacy of its past and the dreams of its future.\n\nNews events:\n\nWith a year to go before its 15th general convention, the race for the prize of the Nepali Congress president is starting to heat up. Senior party leader Shekhar Koirala has ‘unofficially’ kicked off his campaign to win the party’s coveted post from Sudurpaschim Province, traditionally a stronghold of party president Sher Bahadur Deuba. Starting the campaign in Deuba’s heartland and getting strong support of party leaders and cadres in the region means he wants to win Deuba's support too, said a Congress leader of the Koirala camp.Koriala, who lost the party president election to Deuba at the 14th general convention in December 2021, is contesting again. The two-term limit imposed by the party charter for the top post prevents Deuba from running again. The incumbent president has so far not disclosed who he will support as his successor. Another potential candidate is General Secretary Gagan Kumar Thapa, who has not officially declared his candidacy but has already activated his network and mechanism to win the support of party workers across the country.Koirala on Friday interacted with party leaders and cadres of nine districts in the Sudurpaschim Province and sought their support for his bid. He and other central members interacted for six hours with local party leaders in Dhangadhi and solicited their views, Govind Raj Pokahrel, who was with Koirala, told the Post. “We had excellent interactions, following rousing welcome from the party leaders and cadres alike in Dhangadhi,” Pokharel said.“You can call it an ‘unofficial’ launch of the campaign but the focus is also on putting pressure on the party leadership to hold the 15th general convention on time,” said Pokharel. “That is the central thrust of the meetings and interactions.”But the prospect of convening the 15th general convention in December 2025 is slim as the party encounters new complications in the distribution of active membership. Only active members can elect party leaders from the ward level. Those elected ward members later vote for the party’s representatives from all 165 electoral constituencies, who in turn vote for the new party leadership. “In order to complete the local conventions on time, we sent active membership application forms to the 165 constituencies as well as party chapters abroad but no constituency has completed its task,” a Congress office bearer said. “This could push back the general convention.” The Congress has formed a task force to look into issues related to the general convention. The general convention is likely to be deferred by a year due to a number of political and technical issues, said Congress lawmaker Ramhari Khatiwada. As per the Congress charter, the party can defer the general convention by a year citing unavoidable circumstances.According to party leaders, there is a big churn happening inside the Congress, with old factions and groups either dismantled or taking new shapes in light of the upcoming general convention. For instance, former foreign minister NP Saud, a longtime aide to Deuba, joined the Koirala faction.More leaders of the Deuba camp have also joined Koirala or Thapa factions. With Deuba out of the race, there is now a competition between Koirala and Thapa to pull leaders from the Deuba camp into their folds, said a Congress central committee member.Though Deuba has kept his cards close to his chest, many Congress leaders believe General Secretary Thapa is now making inroads into the Deuba camp. The two have been getting closer after CPN-UML chair KP Sharma Oli became the prime minister in July. “Deuba has so far refrained from fully supporting Thapa, Koirala or any other candidate,” said Khatiwada, chair of the federal parliament’s State Affairs Committee. There is also a chance of Deuba rooting for Dr Shashanka Koirala as next party president.“I will build a Nepali Congress suitable to the times we live in after the 15th general convention,” Shekhar Koirala said in Dhangadhi on Saturday. “In order to strengthen the party, I am ready to take over its leadership.” Koirala said the focus is on holding the general convention by December 2025 as stipulated in the charter, and there should be “no ifs and buts about this”. Soon after he lost the party presidency in 2021, Koirala started campaigning for the next convention, travelling across the country, meeting party cadres and most often playing the role of the party’s “opposition” leader. Congress central working committee member Ajaya Babu Shiwakoti, who is close to Gagan Thapa, said Thapa is busy handling the mechanism formed by the ruling Nepali Congress and the CPN-UML to make the government’s work effective, as well as with the party’s internal works, “which is why he appears slow in preparing for the next convention”. “But he [Thapa] is constantly in touch with party leaders and cadres across the country,” said Shiwakoti. “Also, there have been no serious talks between Koirala and Thapa on who will contest the post of party president.” Thapa contested and won the general secretary position from the Koirala camp at the last convention. While Koirala lost the top post, Thapa won with a wide margin of votes.There is a section of leaders in the Koirala-Thapa camp who still believe the two leaders should come together and contest the elections in consensus so that the camp can win a maximum number of seats in the Congress central working committee and other bodies of the party. \nAround four dozen Tribhuvan University teachers who went abroad on study leave have not returned, flouting the university law.Following the publication of a media report that said the opportunity to study abroad was being misused, the TU had sought data from its different departments. The Centre for Investigative Journalism reported that the country’s oldest varsity doesn’t have a proper record of its teachers who have gone abroad on paid ‘study leaves’ and whether they have returned after completing their study abroad.On December 8, the university’s Coordination Division had directed all of its constituent colleges, institutes and agencies concerned to report about such teachers. “As of now, we have received the information that at least 42 teaching staff who have travelled abroad for study haven’t returned, flouting existing laws,” Deepak Tiwari, the Division’s acting chief, told the Post. “It will take some days for us to prepare the detailed report.”The university allows its teachers—mainly the lecturers and assistant professors—to study abroad for their capability enhancement. Any teacher who has taught for five years after permanent posting is eligible to get paid study leave for three to five years.While lecturers themselves find the universities of their choice for the study, there are also the opportunities allocated for the teachers from the TU. Most of such study abroad opportunities the Nepali teachers get are scholarships, mainly for the Mphil or PhD programme.The university’s ‘Teacher Staff Service Rules-1994’ has specific provisions about the eligibility for such opportunities. Its clause 30 states that teachers who have used their study leave for five years must return to service and serve for at least five years. One using three years of leave has to be in the classrooms for the same period after the completion of their study abroad.The teachers wanting to get paid leave for study abroad must sign a bond with the coordination division in line with the TU staff rules. They also need to present a witness while signing the bond based on the service rules.The rule’s clause 84 states that if a teacher doesn’t attend the office for 90 days, the university can sack them. However, there are minimal cases where such teachers have been sacked.So much so that, in several cases, the teachers who have been staying abroad have been receiving the salary from the university. The university administration says they will fully implement the law once all the data of the defiant teachers is available.The report of the University Grants Commission states that as many as 8,122 teachers are associated with the oldest university. Of them 689 are professors, 2,199 are associate professors, 4,124 lectures, 984 assistant lectures and 126 are instructors.Among universities, the TU receives the highest budget from the government. Of the total Rs17.46 billion for the university education, the oldest and the largest university ‘s receives Rs12.26 billion. \nMina Karki from Dekuldanda in Ribdikot rural municipality, Palpa, has been engaged in beekeeping for 30 years. But recently, with the rising use of pesticides in commercial farming, she has been facing the problem. Bees are dying or fleeing.Most farmers are worried because honeybees are crucial to the food supply, pollinating over 100 crops. Reports say that three-fourths of the world's flowering plants and about 35 percent of the world's food crops depend on animal pollinators to reproduce. Karki, who has been doing beekeeping with the support of her husband, has more than 25 hives. She earns Rs60,000 annually and is motivated to earn while staying at home.“But dying bees have troubled many people like me,” said Karki. “I’ve been in the beekeeping business for three decades. This problem was rare.”Hom Bahadur Bhattarai of Bhairavsthan of Ribdikot has at least 35 hives. He has seen bees flying away. The hives have shrunk due to deaths as well.The Bhattarai couple said the problem became severe in the past couple of years. After generating a good income, Bhattarai added hives. He extracts honey three times a year. He assumed that the haphazard use of pesticides in vegetable and chilli farming has started impacting beekeeping.Nara Bahadur Palli of Jhadewa in Mathagadhi rural municipality has bee hives, around 90, on his terrace.He has been keeping traditional wooden hives for seven decades. Palli’s source of income is honey produced in the hives. But he is facing the same problems as Karki and Bhattarai.“Nobody has taken an initiative to solve the problem,” said Palli.Small investments, less hard work, and good benefits made beekeeping lucrative for many villagers. What threatens the occupation’s sustainability is that beekeepers do not receive technical and promotional support from the government. “Who will help us?” questions Palli. “I have been doing it on my own. I go to Tarai to sell the honey, and I am fine with that.”The subsidies provided by the government are gobbled up by those who are clever and have direct access to it, said Palli.Customers now reach farmers’ homes to buy honey, so there is no problem with sales. However, problems with beekeeping have only compounded.“I used to make at least Rs150,000 from honey a year. But, recently, there are no bees in half the hives,” said Palli. “Bees are disappearing. Most hives are empty. Even others have fewer bees.”Farmers are unable to stop bees from dying or fleeing. Though they have tried to retain the bees, nothing seems to be working.Farmers say long dry spells of winter, lack of bee pasture and excessive rainfall were also the reasons behind the declining bee populations.Marmara in Palpa is a good bee pasture area. Agriculture technicians said honey can be extracted three to five times in this area.Palli said that though he could save bees from other wild insects and pests, he failed to save them from dying due to the excessive use of harmful chemicals.Santosh Kumar Chaudhary, an agri expert and acting chief of the Agriculture Knowledge Centre, said that due to the impact of climate change, pests have been increasing, and farmers are applying more pesticides. “Recently, village farmers have started using pesticides on vegetables, fruits, and round chillis. But no one is aware of its direct and indirect impact.”Haphazard use of pesticides has not only made people suffer from diseases but also hugely impacted bees, Chaudhary said.The Agriculture Knowledge Center has removed subsidies for beekeepers.With the failure of the Smart Krishi Programme operated in Marmara of Jhadewa, Mathagadhi rural municipality by the Lumbini province, the government has allocated funds only for general training.Chaudhary said beekeepers had not been informed about the problem.However, according to the Agriculture Knowledge Centre, farmers’ use of pesticides for commercial farming might have impacted bees.With or without government support, farmers are earning well from beekeeping and are commercialising beekeeping at low costs.The government data shows there are more than 20,000 bee hives in Palpa. If the processing, packaging, and market management can be done with less pesticide use, farmers can be more commercial and earn more, said an agri expert. \nWomen play critical roles in the lives of writers, providing inspiration, support, and enduring compassion, as evidenced by the experiences of the wives of literary figures like Leo Tolstoy, PB Shelley, and Laxmi Prasad Devkota, highlighting the significance of their contributions and the need for recognition in literary criticism.\nPhysical and mental health issues are prevalent worldwide, leading to conditions like stress, depression, and weakened immune systems, with meditation recognized as a tool to promote well-being and reduce these ailments.\nPakistan's youth, the nation's future, grapple with challenges, requiring guidance from parents, role models, and understanding of life's complexities, while social media and religious teachings play significant roles in shaping their paths.\nAir pollution in Nepal has reached critical levels, significantly reducing life expectancy, with the government's directives often ignored, highlighting the need for comprehensive collaboration and systemic changes to improve air quality.\nA car-ramming attack at a Christmas market in Germany sparked political tensions as authorities investigate a Saudi suspect with anti-Islamic views while the far-right AfD party mobilizes supporters under the guise of a vigil.\nDelhi's severe air pollution (AQI 700) prompted temporary school closures and mask use, but the crisis eased as AQI dropped below 250, raising concerns about ignorance leading to Kolkata's increasing air pollution (150-200 AQI) due to transboundary pollution, natural factors, and anthropogenic activities.\nWith hostile Turkish-backed groups mobilising against them in Syria's north, and Damascus ruled by a group friendly to Ankara, Syria's main Kurdish factions are on the back foot as they seek to preserve political gains carved out during 13 years of war.Part of a stateless ethnic group straddling Iraq, Iran, Turkey, Armenia and Syria, Kurds have so far been among the few winners of the Syrian conflict, controlling nearly a quarter of the country and leading a powerful armed group that is a key US ally in countering Islamic State.But the power balance has tilted against them since the Islamist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) swept into Damascus this month, toppling President Bashar al-Assad, two analysts and a senior Western diplomat told Reuters.The seismic change in Syria is expected to yield deeper Turkish sway just as a change of US administration is raising questions over how long Washington will keep backing the country's Kurdish-led forces.For Turkey, the Kurdish factions represent a national security threat. Ankara views them as an extension of the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), which has been waging an insurgency against the Turkish state since 1984 and is deemed a terrorist group by Turkey, the United States and other powers.The Syrian Kurdish groups \"are in deep, deep trouble\", said Aron Lund, a fellow at Century International, a US-based think tank.\"The balance has shifted fundamentally in Syria to the advantage of Turkey-backed or Turkey-aligned factions, and Turkey seems determined to exploit this to the fullest.\"The shift has been reflected in renewed fighting for control of the north, where Turkey-backed armed groups known as the Syrian National Army (SNA) have made military advances against the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF).Fanar al-Kait, a senior official in the Kurdish-led regional administration, told Reuters that the ouster of Assad, whose Arab nationalist Baath Party oppressed Kurds for decades, presented a chance to stitch the fragmented country back together.He said the administration is ready for dialogue with Turkey, but the conflict in the north showed Ankara had \"very bad intentions\".\"This will certainly push the region towards ... a new conflict,\" he added.Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan said on Friday he expected foreign states would withdraw support for Kurdish fighters following Assad's toppling, as Ankara seeks to isolate the People's Protection Units (YPG), the Kurdish militia that spearheaded the SDF alliance.Responding to questions from Reuters, a Turkish official said the root cause of the conflict is \"not Turkey's view towards the region; it is that the PKK/YPG is a terrorist organisation\".\"The PKK/YPG elements must lay down their arms and leave Syria,\" the official said.SDF commander Mazloum Abdi, in a Reuters interview on Thursday, acknowledged the presence of PKK fighters in Syria for the first time, saying they had helped battle Islamic State and would return home in the event a total ceasefire was agreed with Turkey. He denied any organisational ties with the PKK.FEMINISM AND ISLAMISMMeanwhile, in Damascus, the new leadership is showing warmth towards Ankara and indicating it wants to bring all Syria back under central authority - a potential challenge to the decentralisation Kurds favour.While Turkey provides direct backing to the SNA, it along with other states deems HTS a terrorist group because of its al Qaeda past.Despite this, Ankara is believed to have significant sway over the group. A senior Western diplomat said: \"The Turks can clearly influence them more than anyone else\".HTS leader Ahmed al-Sharaa told a Turkish newspaper that Assad's ouster was \"not only the victory of the Syrian people, but also the Turkish people\".The Turkish official said HTS was not and never had been under Ankara's control, calling it a structure \"we were communicating with due to circumstances\" and adding many Western states were also doing so.Syrian Kurdish groups led by the Democratic Union Party (PYD) and the affiliated YPG militia took control of much of the north after the uprising against Assad began in 2011. They established their own administration, while insisting their aim was autonomy, not independence.Their politics, emphasising socialism and feminism, differ starkly from HTS' Islamism.Their area grew as US-led forces partnered with the SDF in the campaign against Islamic State, capturing Arab-majority areas.The Turkey-backed SNA groups stepped up their campaign against the SDF as Assad was being toppled, seizing the city of Manbij on December 9Washington brokered a ceasefire, but the SDF has said Turkey and its allies have not abided by it, and a Turkish defence ministry official said there was no such deal.US support for the SDF has been a point of tension with its NATO ally, Turkey. Washington views the SDF as a key partner in countering Islamic State, which Secretary of State Antony Blinken has warned will try to use this period to re-establish capabilities in Syria. The SDF is still guarding tens of thousands of detainees linked to the militant group.Turkish Defence Minister Yasar Guler said last weekend that Turkey saw no sign of an Islamic State resurgence in Syria. On Friday, Turkey's foreign minister, Hakan Fidan, told his German counterpart during talks in Ankara that alternatives needed to be found for the management of camps and prisons where the detainees are being held.Separately, US Assistant Secretary of State for Near Eastern Affairs Barbara Leaf said on Friday that Washington was working with Ankara and the SDF to find \"a managed transition in terms of SDF's role in that part of the country.\"President Joe Biden's administration has said that US troops will stay on in Syria, but President-elect Donald Trump could remove them when he takes office on January 20.LETTER TO TRUMPDuring his first administration, Trump attempted to pull out of Syria but faced pressure at home and from US allies.In a December 17 letter to Trump, reviewed by Reuters, top Syrian Kurdish official Ilham Ahmed said Turkey was preparing to invade the northeast before he takes office.Turkey's plan \"threatens to undo years of progress in securing stability and fighting terrorism\", she wrote. \"We believe you have the power to prevent this catastrophe.\"Trump's transition team did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Trump said on December 16 that Turkey will \"hold the key\" to what happens in Syria but has not announced his plans for US forces stationed there.\"The Kurds are in an unenviable position,\" said Joshua Landis, a Syria expert at the University of Oklahoma. \"Once Damascus consolidates its power, it will move on the region. The US can't remain there forever.\"HTS leader Sharaa told British broadcaster the BBC that Kurds were \"part of our people\" and \"there should be no division of Syria\", adding arms should be entirely in the state's hands.Sharaa acknowledged one of Turkey's main concerns—the presence of non-Syrian Kurdish fighters in Syria—and said: \"We do not accept that Syrian lands threaten and destabilize Turkey or other places.\"He pledged to work through dialogue and negotiations to find \"a peaceful formula to solve the problem,\" saying he believed initial contacts had been established \"between the Kurds in northeastern Syria or the SDF organisation\".Kait, the Kurdish official, said his administration wanted \"a democratic Syria, a decentralized Syria, a Syria that represents all Syrians of all sects, religions and ethnicities,\" describing these as red lines. The SDF would be \"a nucleus of the coming Syrian army,\" he added.SDF commander Abdi, in his Reuters interview, confirmed that contact had been established with HTS to avoid clashes between their forces but said Ankara would try to drive a wedge between Damascus and the Kurdish-led administration.Still, he said there was strong support from international parties, including the US-led coalition, for the SDF joining \"the new political phase\" in Damascus, calling it \"a great opportunity\".\"We are preparing, after a total ceasefire between us and between Turkey and the affiliated factions, to join this phase,\" he said. \nThe Meteorological Forecasting Division has said that a mild influence of a westerly disturbance is currently affecting Nepal. Gandaki, Karnali, and Sudurpaschim provinces are experiencing partial cloud cover, while other regions have generally clear skies. This morning, fog has been observed in some parts of the Tarai and Valleys. There is also a likelihood of mist in certain areas of the Tarai, potentially impacting daily activities, tourism, mountaineering, road transport, and aviation. The division has urged necessary precautions.   \nA packed bus collided with a truck and burst into flames early on Saturday in Brazil, killing at least 22 people, the fire department said.The bus carrying 45 passengers had a tire blowout and the driver lost control of the vehicle, which crashed into an oncoming truck loaded with tiles at 4 am on a major highway near the town of Teofilo Otoni, in Minas Gerais state.Firefighters said they rescued 13 passengers from the wrecked bus. Three occupants of a car that also collided and was trapped under the truck survived the accident.“Firefighters have recovered 22 bodies from the bus, and more victims are still to be removed,” fireman Alonso Vieira Junior said in a video released by the fire department.He said a crane was needed to access another section of the bus where additional victims are located. \nAt least five people were killed in a car-ramming attack at a German Christmas market in the city of Magdeburg that also left more than 200 injured, officials said, and a Saudi man was arrested on suspicion of driving a car into the crowd.The Friday evening attack on market visitors gathered to celebrate the pre-Christmas season comes amid a fierce debate over security and migration during an election campaign in Germany, where the far right is polling strongly.“What a terrible act it is to injure and kill so many people there with such brutality,” Chancellor Olaf Scholz said in the central city, part of the former East Germany, where he laid a white rose at a church in honour of the victims.“We have now learnt that over 200 people have been injured,” he added. “Almost 40 are so seriously injured that we must be very worried about them.”German authorities are investigating a 50-year-old Saudi doctor who has lived in Germany for almost two decades in connection with the car-ramming. Police searched his home overnight.The motive remained unclear and police have not yet named the suspect. He has been named in German media as Taleb A.A Saudi source told Reuters that Saudi Arabia had warned German authorities about the attacker after he posted extremist views on his personal X account that threatened peace and security.Der Spiegel reported that the suspect had sympathised with the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party. The magazine did not say where it got the information.Germany’s domestic intelligence agency declined to comment on the ongoing investigation.Germany’s FAZ newspaper said it interviewed the suspect in 2019, describing him as an anti-Islam activist.“People like me, who have an Islamic background but are no longer believers, are met with neither understanding nor tolerance by Muslims here,” he was quoted as saying. “I am history’s most aggressive critic of Islam. If you don’t believe me, ask the Arabs.”Andrea Reis, who had been at the market on Friday, returned on Saturday with her daughter Julia to lay a candle by the church overlooking the site. She said that had it not been for a matter of moments, they may have been in the car’s path.“I said, ‘let’s go and get a sausage’, but my daughter said ‘no let’s keep walking around.’ If we’d stayed where we were we’d have been in the car’s path,” she said.Tears ran down her face as she described the scene. “Children screaming, crying for mama. You can’t forget that,” she said.Scholz’s Social Democrats are trailing both the far-right AfD and the frontrunner conservative opposition in opinion polls ahead of snap elections set for February 23.The AfD, which enjoys particularly strong support in the former East, has led calls for a crackdown on migration to the country.Its chancellor candidate Alice Weidel and co-leader Tino Chrupalla issued a statement on Saturday condemning the attack.“The terrible attack on the Christmas market in Magdeburg in the middle of the peaceful pre-Christmas period has shaken us,” they said.A leading Social Democrat lawmaker in the Bundestag parliament warned against jumping to conclusions and said it appeared the attacker did not have an Islamist motive.“Now we have to wait for the investigations. It seems that things are different here than was initially assumed,” Dirk Wiese told the Rheinische Post newspaper. \nSudurpaschim Royals have set a formidable 185-run target for Janakpur Bolts in the Nepal Premier League (NPL) cricket final, thanks to a century partnership between Saif Zaib and Binod Bhandari.Batting first at the Tribhuvan University Cricket Ground in Kirtipur after winning the toss, Sudurpaschim scored 184 runs, losing 9 wickets. Captain Dipendra Singh Airee’s decision to bat first paid off as Zaib and Bhandari dominated the opening 12 overs, adding 117 runs for the first wicket.Zaib, who scored a brisk half-century off 33 balls, helped Sudurpaschim make an explosive start, with 97 runs in the first 10 overs without losing a wicket. He was dropped on 62 in the 13th over, but Kishore Mahato dismissed him shortly after for 69 runs off 43 balls, hitting 8 fours and 2 sixes. Mahato also took two crucial wickets in the final over, finishing with figures of 3 for 25 in 3 overs.Bhandari, the other opener, contributed a steady 41 runs off 31 balls, including 1 four and 3 sixes, before being bowled by Lalit Rajbanshi, who impressed with an economical spell, conceding only 15 runs in his 4 overs with 1 maiden.Other contributions came from Harmeet Singh (14 off 8 balls), Scott Kuggeleijn (13 off 10 balls), and Jimmy Neesham (14 off 12 balls). Dipendra Airee (9) and Aarif Sheikh (1) fell cheaply in the middle order. Mohammad Mohsin also claimed 3 wickets, conceding 40 runs in his 4 overs.Janakpur’s bowlers struggled against Sudurpaschim’s top-order batting, but Lalit Rajbanshi’s disciplined performance stood out. Jimmy Neesham and Kishore Mahato picked up a wicket each, with Neesham conceding 44 runs in 4 overs.Both teams fielded unchanged line-ups from their previous matches. Sudurpaschim advanced to the final after defeating Janakpur in Qualifier 1, while Janakpur overcame Karnali Yaks in Qualifier 2.Sudurpaschim have been dominant throughout the tournament, winning 7 out of 8 matches, including two victories against Janakpur. In the group stage, they beat Janakpur by 72 runs and dismissed them for a record-low 51 runs.Janakpur, led by New Zealand all-rounder Jimmy Neesham, reached the final by defeating Karnali in a thrilling Qualifier 2. Neesham took 2 wickets and scored a quick 45 off 17 balls to chase down Karnali’s 118-run target with an over to spare.With Sudurpaschim’s recent record and Janakpur’s resilience, the NPL final promises an exciting contest. \nJanakpur Bolts clinched the Nepal Premier League (NPL) cricket title with a spectacular five-wicket win over Sudurpaschim Royals, thanks to Lahiru Milantha’s stunning batting performance. Milantha’s 87 off 49 balls led Janakpur to chase down a challenging 185-run target with four balls to spare at the Tribhuvan University Cricket Ground in Kirtipur on Saturday.Janakpur got off to a flying start, adding 71 runs in the powerplay and 105 runs in the first 10 overs. Milantha, who completed his half-century in just 31 balls, was dropped on 65 when Sudurpaschim captain Dipendra Singh Airee missed a caught-and-bowled opportunity. Milantha’s innings included 9 fours and 4 sixes.Opener Aasif Sheikh contributed 33 runs off 19 balls, featuring 4 fours and 2 sixes, setting a solid foundation for Janakpur. Lower-order contributions from Harsh Thaker (30 off 24 balls) and Mayank Yadav (2 not out) sealed the victory. Sudurpaschim’s bowlers struggled, with Airee conceding 40 runs for a wicket in his 4 overs, while Saif Zaib, Ishan Pandey, and Scott Kuggeleijn took one wicket each.Earlier, Sudurpaschim posted 184 runs after electing to bat first. Opener Saif Zaib scored a brisk 69 off 43 balls, and Binod Bhandari added 41 off 31 balls, sharing a 117-run stand for the first wicket. Janakpur’s Kishore Mahato (3/25) and Mohammad Mohsin (3/40) led the bowling attack, restricting Sudurpaschim’s middle order.Janakpur’s triumph marked a comeback, as Sudurpaschim had defeated them twice earlier in the tournament. With this win, Janakpur Bolts emerged as the champions of the NPL, showcasing resilience and brilliant teamwork in the final. \nLahiru Milantha's final match heroics propelled him to the top of the scoring charts, while Lalit Rajbanshi and Scott Kuggeleijn's bowling prowess led the tournament in wicket-taking.\nSeven years and seven months after inking the Memorandum of Understanding on the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), Nepal and China on Wednesday signed a framework for BRI cooperation during Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli’s China visit, which ends on Thursday.Acting Foreign Secretary Amrit Bahadur Rai and deputy head of China’s National Development and Reform Commission Liu Sushe signed the framework cooperation on behalf of the respective countries. The commission is the focal agency in China, tasked with the development of BRI projects.The framework will be valid for three years and will get another three-year extension unless terminated by either side.Speaking briefly from Beijing with the Post, Foreign Minister Arzu Rana Deuba said that the framework signed on Wednesday is not new. “It should be understood as a continuation of the memorandum of understanding signed in 2017,” she added.A joint task force of the Nepali Congress and the CPN-UML, the two largest parties and ruling partners, in Kathmandu had tweaked the original BRI implementation plan proposed by the Chinese side in 2020.Wednesday’s development formally endorses Nepal’s involvement in the BRI, a programme China proposed and Nepal initially signed in 2017. But negotiations on the projects under the BRI could still prove difficult in the future.‘Aid financing modalities’, as have been agreed under the new framework, have elements of both grant and loan, said one Nepali official who is a part of Oli’s delegation in Beijing.“Even as we signed the framework, we were clear that we cannot accept projects under the BRI with interest rates exceeding those charged by bilateral and multilateral donors,” the official said. “Our focus would be on seeking grants and concessional loans in line with the interest rates offered by the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank and other bilateral and multilateral agencies.”Wednesday’s agreement paves the way for negotiations on the ten projects that Nepal had proposed to China.“Today, we signed the Framework for Belt and Road Cooperation,” Prime Minister Oli wrote in his X account. “I am honoured to reflect on the bilateral talks with Premier Li Qiang, discussions with National People’s Congress of China Chairman Zhao Leji and the highly fruitful meeting with President Xi Jinping.”The economic cooperation between Nepal and China will further strengthen under the Belt and Road Framework Cooperation, writes Oli.Just ahead of the prime minister’s departure for Beijing on Monday, the Nepali side had sent a new version of the framework for BRI cooperation and insisted on grants as the project financing model. But the Chinese side objected to the words and replaced them with ‘assistance financing’ and sent the document back to the Nepali side for consideration.“Then we sat again, spoke with the prime minister and proposed a middle path using the phrase ‘aid financing’ as a modality,” one Nepali member of the delegation told the Post from Beijing over the phone. “The Chinese took some time to consider our proposal. Therefore, the new BRI framework is missing in the joint communiqué released late Tuesday. Eventually, both parties agreed on the term ‘aid assistance financing’ and the agreement was signed on Wednesday.” On Nepal’s side, the negotiations were led by Prime Minister Oli’s economic and development adviser Yubaraj Khatiwada, Foreign Minister Arzu Rana Deuba and Acting Foreign Secretary Rai. High-ranking foreign ministry officials represented the Chinese delegation.As Nepal and China are in different stages of development, projects will be selected on the basis of Nepal’s specific requirements and needs. During project negotiation, the final BRI framework agreement states, both sides should uphold the principle of technical, financial, commercial and economic viability and value for money. Likewise, both sides will work to create a conducive business environment.The ‘Objective’ of the BRI framework cooperation states that both sides should facilitate the financial and technical cooperation for each project, and they identified the areas of cooperation—economic development, financial sector cooperation, transport, connectivity and logistic cooperation, trade industrial capacity and investment cooperation, and customs clearance—according to another member of the Nepali delegation who is in Beijing.Nepal has proposed ten different projects to be executed under the BRI. They are Tokha-Chhahare tunnel road, Hilsa-Simikot road project, Kimathanka-Khandbari road and bridge, Jilong-Kerung-Kathmandu cross-border railway, Amargadhi City Hall in Dadeldhura, Jilong-Kerung-Rasuwagadhi-Chilime 220KV transmission line, Madan Bhandari University, Kathmandu Scientific Centre and Science Museum, China-Nepal friendship industrial park in Damak and Jhapa sports and athletic complex.Nepal will set priorities and prepare the implementation plan for each of these projects. The Nepali side, in the negotiation phase, had changed several proposals.The Nepali side significantly shortened the list of priority areas originally proposed by the Chinese side in early 2020 which included construction of the Trans-Himalayan Multi Dimensional Connectivity Network, including ports, roads, bridges, tunnels, highways, railways, aviation infrastructure, telecom projects, electricity transmission line, carrying out the China-Nepal cross-border railway project.Similarly, the two sides will develop implementation plans for energy related projects, cooperation in the field of e-commerce and trade and industrial capacity enhancement, building trade infrastructures, adopting trade and investment liberalisation, and expanding bilateral economic relationship.The BRI framework provides significant impetus for a stronger economic and project development partnership between the two countries, said Semanta Dahal, who was part of the task force that revised the BRI framework on behalf of the ruling coalition in a capacity of legal adviser. He added that it addresses ambiguities surrounding the infrastructure projects to be implemented under the BRI in Nepal and establishes clear negotiation principles, including the use of aid financing.“This will facilitate negotiations on a project-by-project basis and ensure that infrastructure and connectivity projects offer value for money,” he said. \nNepali officials were paid $2.5 million in bribes to seal the contract for the $209.6-million Airbus deal, the largest in Nepal’s aviation history, charging documents filed in the US court show.Deepak Sharma, a former executive of the US-based aviation services provider AAR, pleaded guilty in July earlier this year to conspiracy to violate the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) anti-bribery provisions. The charges were based on allegations that Sharma was part of a conspiracy to bribe Nepali officials to secure two Airbus A330 deals in 2017.Sharma pleaded guilty and agreed to forfeit around $130,000. His sentences are yet to be determined, so this case is ongoing.Sharma, a Nepal-born British citizen, joined AAR in 2015. Before this, he was the chief technical officer at AJW Group, which he joined in 2008. He has also been the engineering director at UK International Airlines.According to the documents in this case obtained by the Post, between November 2015 and August 2018, Sharma conspired with others to pay bribes to Nepali officials to win a bid to sell two Airbus A330-200 aircraft on behalf of AAR Corp to Nepal Airlines Corporation.On June 24, 2024, the US Department of Justice alleged that Sharma—as an agent for AAR—conspired to bribe Nepali officials and filed a single count of information under seal in the District of Columbia, alleging a conspiracy to violate the FCPA’s anti-bribery provisions.In July, guilty pleas were publicly revealed, five years after AAR disclosed possible FCPA violations. The court unsealed the case on August 1, 2024, in connection with a plea agreement.In December 2016, Nepal Airlines selected a group consisting of AAR Corp, German Aviation Capital, and Hi Fly (airline) of Portugal to purchase two widebody aircraft. The month before, according to the investigation transcript, Sharma sent a text message to a conspirator, stating: “I am having dinner with the head of the evaluation committee now. We are discussing how to throw others out even if they come below our bid. See you tomorrow.”In an Information filed, the US Department of Justice alleged that Sharma, on behalf of AAR, agreed to bribe Nepali officials to manipulate the deal in favour of AAR and a German aircraft leasing and trading company, working with a Nepali intermediary and an unnamed co-conspirator [a director of an affiliate of the German company] to facilitate a sham transaction between the German aircraft company and Nepal Airlines.The Information describes Sharma’s email and text communications, as well as invoices and wire transfer records, which record payments made by the German company's Ireland-based Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) to a United Arab Emirates-based bank account used by the Nepali intermediary to fund bribes to Nepali officials. In Nepal, on April 4, the Commission for Investigation of Abuse of Authority (CIAA), the constitutional anti-graft body, completed its five-year probe into the Airbus deal, concluding that procuring two wide-body Airbus A330 jets caused a loss of Rs1.47 billion ($13.38 million) to the government.The loss was computed based on the exchange rate at the time of the last instalment payment in 2018.The CIAA filed a case against 32 individuals at the Special Court for their alleged corruption in the deal, commonly known as the ‘wide-body scam’. The court is expected to issue a verdict within this month.The first of the two wide-body aircraft, Annapurna, arrived at the Tribhuvan International Airport in June 2018. The second, Makalu, came a month later.In a statement, the commission said it had filed the case against a former minister, high-level sitting and retired government officials, private sector representatives, and aircraft suppliers.The accused are former tourism minister Jeevan Bahadur Shahi, former managing director of Nepal Airlines Sugat Ratna Kansakar, former tourism secretary Shankar Adhikari and former finance secretary Shishir Kumar Dhungana.At the time of the deal, Adhikari and Dhungana were on the board of the national flag carrier.In charging documents filed in the US court, Sharma is described as an “agent” of Company 1 (a reference to AAR).“It was the purpose of the conspiracy for Sharma and his co-conspirators to illegally benefit Company 1, Subsidiary 1 [a wholly-owned subsidiary of Company 1], and others by bribing Nepali officials, including Foreign Official 1 [a Nepali citizen who served as a high-level official at Nepal Airlines Corporation from at least approximately 2015 through 2019] in order to win a bid to sell two Airbus A330-200 aircraft to the state-owned national carrier.”Sharma and his co-conspirators made and received wire transfers intended, in part, as bribes for Nepali officials in connection with Nepal Airlines Corporation transactions, using bank accounts in the United States, Ireland, and the United Arab Emirates, among other places.Sharma and his co-conspirators attempted to disguise the wire transfers as legitimate business transactions by entering into sham agreements between Subsidiary 2 [a wholly-owned subsidiary of Company 1], Company 2 [an aircraft leasing and trading company based in Germany], and Company 3 [a special purpose vehicle incorporated in Ireland and managed by Company 2] on the one hand, and Companies 4 [a Hong Kong incorporated company used by Intermediary] and 5 [a United Arab Emirates incorporated company used by Intermediary] on the other. Some payments were made under sham invoices sent by Sharma and his co-conspirators from Companies 4 and 5 and directed to Company 3. The invoices falsely referred to the bribe payments as “advances”.“In total, between in or around May and August 2018, Company 3 paid Company 5 the equivalent of approximately $2,500,000 in connection with Nepal Airlines transaction, a portion of which Sharma understood would be distributed as bribes to Nepali officials, including Foreign Official 1.”On or about March 29, 2016, approximately six months before Nepal Airlines publicly issued a Request for Proposal (RFP) for the purchase of two A330s, Sharma forwarded an email to two executives at Company 1 containing a draft RFP that was circulated among Nepal Airlines Corporation officials, including Foreign Official 1. In his email to the two executives at Company 1, Sharma stated, “Please find attached Draft RFP[.] NOTE: [T]his [is] not published yet, and it is strictly for three of us [a Company 1 executive], you and I, to comment and change any terms to suit [Company 1]. Let me know if you want any changes made to the payment terms or bid terms so that it favours [Company 1]. I can ask these to be incorporated [sic] into the RFP for publication. I am meeting with the [Foreign Official 1] and Chairman this week…”On or about September 1, 2016, approximately one month before Nepal Airlines Corporation publicly issued the RFP, Foreign Official 1 sent an email to Sharma, writing, “What I have in mind is that we will specify MOU signing date, purchase agreement date and delivery date in such a way that [a competitor of Company 1] cannot meet delivery dates.“Following are tentative dates, and I want your feedback on whether you can meet delivery dates… Tentative dates I fixed but not yet shared with other Nepal Airlines executives…”On October 30, 2016, Foreign Official 1 texted Sharma, “[N]o need to worry at all. Almost all higher-ups are in our pocket.”On May 15, 2018, Sharma sent Individual 1 a text message about Intermediary and Foreign Official 1 pressuring to pay Company 5’s invoice, writing, “The Nepali guys is [sic] chasing like hell.”On May 17, 2018, Sharma sent an email to Individual 1 with an attached invoice from Company 5 to Company 3 for $450,000 for “Service Provided for Bid and Sale of X2A330 as an Advance.”On July 3, 2018, Individual 1 and others caused a wire transfer of approximately 390,000 EURO (the equivalent of roughly $450,000) from Company 3’s bank account in Ireland to Company 5’s bank account in the United Arab Emirates, in part for the benefit of Nepali officials, including Foreign Official 1On August 9, 2018, the Intermediary emailed Sharma, attaching two invoices from Company 5 to Company 3 for $1,000,000 each for “Service Provided for Bid and sale of X2 A330 as an Advance.”On August 10, 2018, Individual 1 and others caused two wire transfers of approximately $1,000,000 each from Company 3’s bank account in Ireland to Company 5’s bank account in the United Arab Emirates, partly for the benefit of Nepali officials, including Foreign Official 1. \nNepal has almost everything it needs for prosperity: A strategic location, tourism potential, hydropower and a young population. Yet, we are trapped in a vicious cycle of low growth and high migration. When the Constitution was finally promulgated two decades after the launch of the Maoist People’s War, we expected politics to be our salvation. Unfortunately, it has become our prison.Nepal's low-growth, high-migration trap isn't just an economic phenomenon—it's a political protection mechanism that preserves an unsustainable kleptocracy and crony capitalism. While the World Bank calls for a “systematic assault” on economic barriers, what Nepal needs is a paradigm shift that will fundamentally transform power relations and dismantle extractive networks.Without such a shift, emerging political agency and a growing structural crisis will create a rupture. The absence of comprehensive political and economic reforms is a matter of serious concern for Nepalis. It does not just affect our graduation to a middle-income status, which has already been pushed behind schedule; it also impacts the lives of millions of people and determines Nepal’s development trajectory.The trapSince the World Bank's initial analysis in 2017, Nepal's “low-growth, high-migration trap” has deepened. According to the World Bank, low-growth fails to generate employment. As a result, a large number of youth are forced to migrate. Migration brings in remittance, enabling consumption but no productive investment. High remittance not only creates economic distortions, but also reduces pressure on the top leaders to deliver reforms. The lack of reforms, in turn, reinforces low growth.Despite poverty reduction, Nepal has been growing at only about 4 percent, marginally better than the 2 percent growth achieved in 2023. At this rate, Nepal will be unable to graduate from LDC at least until 2030.Nepal’s economic trends and fiscal positions are becoming increasingly unsustainable, creating pressures for change. For example, budget execution rates are below 80 percent, revenue collection is dwindling, capital expenditure is low, and the debt service burden is rising.While the per capita income remains at around $1,400, limiting job creation, the manufacturing sector’s GDP share has shrunk by half since 2008. While migration is increasing, fiscal indicators are worsening. Our dependence on migration is growing. While public debt is about 44 percent of the GDP, our revenues are shrinking. Debt servicing and financial management consume almost 20 percent of the budget, while development expenditure has shrunk to 19 percent and is poorly executed.Political agencyThe kleptocracy, patronised by top political leaders, extracts power and money from the people and the state. In doing so, they misuse state power, distort its bodies and hollow out legal institutions. Despite this, political agency has failed to drive change.Institutions like the World Bank have been advocating comprehensive reforms. For example, they want to break policy barriers, build new growth sources, revitalise agriculture, address migration issues and unleash financial reforms. These reforms would make the economy more competitive, productive and broad-based. All of these recommendations directly impact the existing extractive system dominated by crony capitalism, kleptocracy and political parties. Initiating changes would mean changing the status quo, which is why these suggestions fail.The failure of new parties to put pressure on traditional parties has not helped. When the Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP) emerged just before the 2022 elections, it was largely driven by the aspirations of migrant workers. However, the ethical dilemma posed by evidence of corruption of RSP’s founder has dented the party’s aspirations. When the current coalition was forged, one of the objectives was to deliver results to the people to show them that there was no need for new parties. This strategy has failed. However, the new parties have met the same fate, ultimately benefiting the entrenched leaders. One of the results of this mismatch between people’s expectations and political delivery is the reluctance of people to identify themselves with a political party. Rather, the disenchantment and dissatisfaction echo in social media in fragmented ways. Activism has not worked because people have become distrustful of not only political parties but also activists who claim to represent civil society.Incremental reforms?There are enough people who believe that incremental reforms in the economy will add up and drive change. Some people are also hopeful that the traditional parties are feeling the pressure and will reform, albeit slowly. Then there are others who think we must seek alternatives to the current political system. Many of them tout China as a model of growth and aspire to have “political stability.”None of these approaches will work, unfortunately.Traditional solutions offered by donors and development partners often fail because they cannot address political-economy factors and political dynamics. These solutions focus on the symptoms rather than the root causes. Incremental reforms are often absorbed by the system, with all its deformities. And when the reforms are significant, the kleptocracy swiftly neutralises the attempts.For a few years, the traditional political parties could create the illusion of change, but all that the superficial democracy did was maintain the status quo. The current political system is rooted in extractive kleptocracy because the parties need each other to survive. Reforms will undermine the sources of political power and wealth. Therefore, political reform is impossible without disrupting the existing political power models.The current political malaise has discredited the whole democratic system. Seeking an alternative to the democratic system, however, is not an option. According to renowned economists, democracies perform at least 20 percent better than non-democracies in delivering prosperity. Democracies can also deliver more investment, economic reforms and public goods.A likely ruptureYes, the emergence of new political forces has faltered. Yet, this is only a temporary blip. At least four quarters are pressing for transformation in our political and economic system: the migrant population, urban youth, a traditionalist nationalist force allied with the former monarchy and a liberal-minded civil society. Even if political agency and social movements have failed to produce well-thought-out political movements, structural factors will continue to push for change because the status quo is untenable, and it is little prepared for shocks that may come from unexpected quarters.New structural pressures are building: Demographic transition creates new demands, digital transformation rearranges political psychology and regional economic integration forces competitiveness. Demographic pressures, economic vulnerabilities, migration impacts and urbanisation pressures will continue to generate strain until the status quo breaks.Our hope is that political agency and the structural crisis will align so that we are able to manage the transformation in a meaningful way. Otherwise, instability and chaos will become unavoidable. \nThe debut edition of the Nepal Premier League Twenty20 cricket tournament is set to kick off on Saturday with a festive atmosphere and with so much anticipation that it could write a new chapter in Nepali cricket.Billed as the ‘Festival of Himalayas’, the NPL has already attracted global interest, with the likes of former Indian opener Shikhar Dhawan and New Zealand allrounder James Neesham, among other big cricketing names, set to light up the eight-team competition that will run until December 21.The involvement of Star Sports Network—a group of Indian television sports channels that also holds the rights of flagship tournaments like Indian Premier League, English Premier League, Wimbledon and ICC events—as the official broadcasting partner will now give the league a worldwide exposure.Partnership with Twenty-first Century Media (TCM) Sports—a sports management company that has managed Cricket World Cups, Asia Cups, IPL and other international events—is further evidence that the NPL aspires to evolve into one of the major cricketing events in the world.Organiser Cricket Association of Nepal appears determined to make the league a landmark event, aiming to propel Nepali cricket into an unprecedented era of growth and global recognition.“The organisation of the NPL is itself a big achievement for CAN and Nepali cricket,” CAN Spokesperson Chhumbi Lama told the Post.“For the first time, our domestic tournament will be broadcast worldwide, making the NPL the ideal platform to elevate Nepali cricket to the international stage,” Lama added. “The inaugural league could be a catalyst for Nepali cricket’s golden era.”CAN has laid out ambitious plans to expand the league in future editions, including multi-venue matches, games under floodlights, and a potential home-and-away format within five years.“This year, the NPL will be hosted at TU Cricket Ground, but as eight cricket stadiums are currently under construction, we plan to expand to cities outside the Kathmandu Valley,” Lama said. “If floodlights are installed at TU Ground, the future matches will be even more spectacular.”CAN has also developed a comprehensive business strategy to ensure the league’s sustainability, with goals to attract government investment and international grants.“This will take Nepali cricket into a commercial era, paving the way for further development of the game,” Lama added. CAN is making another effort to establish its own franchise league in the country following a debacle of its previous venture. It had organised Nepal T20 League in the 2022/23 season but the tournament proved a disaster as it was overshadowed by spot-fixing allegations, resulting in the involvement of Central Investigation Bureau and several arrests.CAN also faced criticisms for its mismanagement, negligence and incompetence. Eventually, the contract with Seven3Sports, to which the tournament rights were sold for eight years without a competitive bidding process, had to be terminated.This time, CAN, in its renewed effort to establish a successful franchise cricket league, seems committed to implementing stringent measures to safeguard the integrity of the NPL.Retired AIG Ishwor Babu Karki, who is the Head of Integrity at CAN and oversees anti-corruption, safeguarding, security and anti-doping for the cricket governing body, will lead the oversight unit during the NPL.“We have taken previous mistakes as a lesson. The NPL will be fair,” said Lama.“Karki will oversee the integrity of the NPL. CAN has also coordinated with all the concerned departments to make sure things comply with the ICC protocol,” he added.“CAN wants to assure that the league will be without any controversy.”The NPL—which is building on the foundation laid by earlier tournaments like Everest Premier League, Dhangadhi Premier League and Pokhara Premier League—is also positioning itself as a game-changer for domestic cricket, with the promise of becoming a vital financial lifeline for domestic players.A major highlight is the league’s title sponsorship deal with Siddhartha Bank Limited, which is being hailed as the largest sponsorship agreement in Nepali sports history. However, the exact figures of the agreement have not been disclosed.Eight franchise teams—Biratnagar Kings, Chitwan Rhinos, Janakpur Bolts, Karnali Yaks, Kathmandu Gurkhas, Lumbini Lions, Pokhara Avengers and Sudurpaschim Royals—collectively spent more than Rs50 million rupees in the auction. They secured marquee players for 2 million each, while the players graded into A B and C categories were auctioned at base prices ranging from Rs20,000 to Rs1.5 million.The big investment underscores the league’s ambition to redefine the profile of cricket in Nepal and provide robust financial support to domestic players.While CAN provides monthly incentives to national players, NPL offers a new pathway for many domestic cricketers to build sustainable careers within the country. The tournament will nurture the next generation of cricketing talent by offering them a platform to showcase their skills and catch the attention of national selectors. Each franchise has identified a local iconic player through talent hunts, further strengthening the grassroots impact of the league.“The NPL will be a big support to domestic cricketers,” Lama said. “The players are very motivated by the initiative. It also lays the ground for grassroots cricket development as the teams have conducted talent hunts in the provinces they represent. And the exciting participation of hundreds of teenagers in the hunts is further evidence of the game’s popularity.”In addition to spotlighting emerging players, the NPL offers national cricketers a global stage to showcase their abilities.“The NPL provides an opportunity for national and domestic players to share the field with foreign professionals and world’s best cricketers. This will help them learn, grow, and improve as cricketers,\" said former national player Sharad Vesawkar, who will represent Chitwan Rhinos in the NPL.Vesawkar also emphasised how the league will help highlight Nepali talent to the world while providing a financial boost to local players aspiring to build careers in cricket. \n\n\n\nRae was the envoy to Kathmandu during the promulgation of the 2015 constitution and the subsequent blockade. In this conversation, Rae talks about the evolution of Nepal-India ties since the blockade, regional geopolitics, what the two countries get wrong about each other, how New Delhi views Nepali communist parties and the governments they lead, and the change (if any) in India’s neighbourhood policy since the start of Narendra Modi’s third term in office. \nWhen I visited ‘The Mini Prints Art Fair’, hosted by Siddhartha Art Gallery, I observed a vibrant celebration of contemporary Nepali art showcasing talented artists. The exhibition features 200 intricate mini-prints using etching, woodcut, and embossing techniques.The fair offers diverse artistic interpretations with works ranging from creations such as ‘Unstable II’ by Sujita Maharjan to cultural depictions like ‘Ganapati Bappa’ by Seema Sharma Shah. Delicately crafted pieces encapsulate themes of tradition, identity, and imagination. This fair not only highlights the technical expertise of Nepali artists but also the evolving narrative of contemporary art in the region. Rustom Mody, country director of the British Council Nepal, inaugurated the event, emphasising the fair’s cultural significance. Visitors will have an immersive experience of vibrant stories told through a small-scale yet impactful medium.The exhibition, organised by Printmaking Nepal, highlights the organisation’s dedication to nurturing the art of printmaking among the younger generation. Focusing on education and creativity, the studio conducts workshops to equip aspiring artists with the skills and confidence to pursue their passions. Over the years, they have collaborated with 100 artists, blending the talents of emerging graduates and seasoned professionals. Their primary aim is to foster collaboration between new and established artists, creating a learning environment based on mentorship and experience-sharing.Uma Shankar Shah, one of the founding members of Printmaking Nepal, wants to make print art more accessible by highlighting its affordability. With prices starting from Rs3,000, Shah hopes audiences will embrace Printmaking Nepal’s message: “Art can be affordable and accessible, allowing common people to own and enjoy it without spending a fortune.”He discussed his artwork titled ‘Ramayan’, inspired by his roots in Janakpur. Having previously worked on series like ‘Roti-Beti’, he continues exploring the Maithili storytelling style, which he notes is rarely represented in art. Shah incorporates iconic imagery in his print art ‘Ramayan’, such as the main gate doors, the bow, and Sita Swayamvar. Visitors will notice a deliberate contrast in the artwork’s use of colour, with one piece being colourful and another monochrome. This distinction is achieved using natural elements, including soil, to bring depth and authenticity to the pieces. He says, “Artists face several challenges in pursuing their craft, with the lack of studio space being a primary concern. Thankfully, there are now at least ten studios in Kathmandu where they can work. Another major difficulty is sourcing materials, such as zinc plates and 20x40-inch paper, which are essential for their work. The process is also physically demanding, using acid for etching and handling heavy stones weighing 15-20 kilograms. These stones must be moved repeatedly across tables, requiring careful precision to avoid accidents, which could result in significant setbacks.”As he walked me through the exhibition, it was evident that it did not follow a central theme. He explained, “All the artists centred their work around a basic question: what can society gain from this? In this exhibition, we focus on the post-postmodernism of the 21st century—not rejecting tradition like postmodernism but delving deeper into cultural roots. As we observe in contemporary society, individuals are increasingly drawn to ancient works, whether through traditional designs in clothing or music. Our focus is on representing societal traditions in a new way.”When asked what message he had for emerging artists, he said, “As both an artist and organiser, my advice to them is that there are studios and opportunities available to showcase the work you create right after graduation. So, don’t give up on pursuing this field. Take inspiration from artists like David Basnet, who, despite being in the middle of his master’s degree, already has his artwork featured in this exhibition. Opportunities like these prove that talent and dedication can open doors, even early in your career.”Sujita Maharjan’s series of prints greets visitors, exploring themes of architectural evolution. One of her works critiques the tension between the instability of modern building designs and the rising costs of preserving traditional aesthetics. Another striking piece features a boat with a building. Her print art also incorporates intricate patterns that draw connections to Buddhism, adding a spiritual dimension to her exploration of architecture and culture.Another artist, Lokchitra, one of Nepal’s well-known traditional ‘paubha’ or ‘thangka’ artists, brings his expertise into printmaking with his work ‘Panchabuddha’. He explained, “This work reflects self-realisation, illustrating the five elements present in our bodies: air, water, fire, earth, and aether. ‘Panchabuddha’ essentially represents us, not external forms of Buddha.” In another piece titled ‘Atala’—meaning ‘unmovable’—he depicts a falchion with two blades, symbolising cutting through ignorance by understanding relative and ultimate truths. His art beautifully merges traditional symbolism with contemporary printmaking techniques.Similarly, David Basnet’s contributions include the print ‘Blooms of Thanksgiving’, inspired by the Christmas season, his gardener father, and his love for plants. The blooming cactus featured in his artwork reflects these personal connections. He explained, “Another piece, ‘Through the Bamboos’, was inspired by Nepal’s recent floods. After learning that bamboo helps prevent soil erosion, I created this artwork to highlight its environmental significance.”Basnet’s third work, ‘Old Cycle’, evokes nostalgia for his childhood memories of cycling in Kathmandu. Another of his prints depicts clock hands obstructed by vines but surrounded by blooming flowers. “Even during moments of obstruction, beauty can still emerge,” Basnet shared.Umesh Shah, primarily a painter, shared that he found printmaking interesting through the workshop. His work mainly incorporates Mithila elements inspired by Bastar Art and folk art. His piece ‘Plantation’ reflects his experience living in the Tarai region, contrasting past greenery with current deforestation. Through this, Shah urges for reforestation and better land utilisation. Another of his prints portrays the dedication and hard work of labourers, despite their insufficient wages, using tribal imagery to emphasise their resilience and struggle.Each artist brings a unique perspective, blending personal stories, cultural heritage, and social commentary._____The Mini Prints Art FairWhen: Until January 15Where: Siddhartha Art Gallery, Babermahal RevisitedTime: Sunday to Friday: 11:00 am to 5:00 pm, Saturday: 12 noon to 5 pmEntry: Free \n‘But Still, We Rise’ will be restaged at Shilpee Theatre, Battisputali, on December 27 and 28. The play was first performed at the Women of the World Nepal 2024 Festival.A majority of the performers identify as differently abled and belong to the LGBTIQA+ community. The play sheds light on the struggles and triumphs of women from marginalised groups, including women with disabilities, queer women, and indigenous women.Deputy Mayor of Kathmandu, Sunita Dangol, said, “It was such a powerful performance. By the end of the show, there wasn’t a single person in the audience without dewy eyes. It is a play that we can relate to on multiple levels.”Tickets are Rs300 for students and theatre artists and Rs500 for general audiences. However, people with disability cards can get free tickets.Sign language interpretation will be available during the performance. However, wheelchair-accessible toilets are unavailable at the venue, though facilities are accessible across the street.____But Still, We RiseWhen: December 27 to 28Where: Shilpee Theatre, BattisputaliEntry: Rs500 \nAs a kid, I was drawn to horror movies. Even though they were frightening, I couldn’t resist the thrill they provided. As I entered my teens, I slowly moved away from movies and began reading. I naturally gravitated toward psychological thrillers, especially those by Indian author Navoneel Chakraborty. Chakraborty’s Stranger Trilogy introduced me to this genre, and at just thirteen, I found it so terrifying that it robbed me of sleep—it felt as intense as watching horror movies.Now, in my early 20s, I still seek that same adrenaline rush. My recent read, ‘His Afflicted Mind’ by Prabigyan Aryal, was the ideal book to appease my craving. It left me wondering what would happen next, and in my search for answers, I couldn’t stop reading. The book was a mix of thrill and fear, keeping me hooked until the last page.Aryal has delved into layered childhood trauma, mental illness, and depression, dissecting these themes. How does the mind of a mentally ill individual function? How can childhood trauma affect an individual’s psyche? These are some of the questions explored in this novel. The novel’s first page contains a trigger warning. Reading it, I prepared for what lies ahead. The story starts when one of the protagonists, Aria, talks to her therapist, Dedric. Shaking uncontrollably and feeling nervous, Aria struggles to share things with her therapist. Dedric tries his best to comfort her to share, as reflected in this line: “Don’t be nervous. I am here to listen. I will respect what you have to say. Take as much time as you want.” Finding comfort in his words, Aria talks about her past. The book then continues in retrospect from December 2, 2017. This narrative technique piqued my curiosity. In the present, Aria struggles to speak to the therapist, and the author's choice of words to articulate her feelings left me wondering how she reached this place mentally.On December 2, 2017, in the fictional town of Ashvale—depicted as bleak and frigid under the grip of a harsh winter—Aria recounts her meeting with Arlo, her cherished childhood friend. She yearns for him, aching to return to their carefree days at age eleven when worries unburdened life. Through her recollection, it becomes clear that Arlo, too, struggled mentally, masking his pain behind a smile. Aria longs to be the one to make him smile, to soothe and love him. However, her yearning never materialises, plunging her into a profound sadness. Her sorrow is so overwhelming that she stands out as the saddest character I have ever read about.As readers turn a few more pages, they uncover not only the depths of Aria’s sorrow but also the severity of her deteriorating mental health. Aria hears sounds that aren’t real and sees things invisible to others. One day, after hearing strange noises, she peers outside her window and surveys the scene. Despite the thick fog, she spots a man dressed entirely in black, smiling at her. The moment she blinks, he vanishes. At first, readers might dismiss this as a fragment of her imagination. However, it becomes evident that it’s something deeper—schizophrenia, which manifests in such vivid hallucinations.Aria’s hallucinations go beyond the man in black; she also repeatedly sees a little girl outside her window—the haunting image of her dead daughter, whom she had burned alive when the child was just five years old. Her fractured mind weaves intricate delusions, using the letters ‘no’ and ‘ah’ from her parents’ names, Norbert and Hannah, to conjure an imaginary brother named Noah. Aria recounts a vivid memory of watching Noah murder her parents right before her eyes when she was a child.However, as the story unfolds, readers discover it was Aria herself who slit her parents’ throats. Her mind, unable to cope with the trauma, deceived her into believing false memories. This twist reveals that Aria suffers not only from schizophrenia but also from confabulation. In this condition, imagined scenarios are confused with real memories, leaving her unable to distinguish between the two.Hence, the book plunges readers into a shadowy, unsettling world of suspense and unease. As I read, I felt an eerie sensation. The author’s ability to evoke such emotions is commendable.What makes ‘His Afflicted Mind' especially engaging is its unpredictable nature. The narrative is slow-paced, deliberately, as it doesn’t reveal everything. Instead, the story keeps you guessing, feeding your curiosity piece by piece. Mysterious events unfold one after another, and just when you think you’ve figured things out, another twist takes you by surprise. This constant anticipation kept me glued to the book, unable to put it down. Additionally, Aryal captures the inner workings of a mentally ill mind with a raw, unfiltered authenticity. Tackling significant subjects like mental illness and childhood trauma while battling depression must have been a difficult task for Aryal. In the author’s note, he writes, “I wrote this book as a way of dealing with depression in my own life and in the hopes of getting more people to understand about what goes on in the mind of someone who is psychologically ill.” In addition, the writing style in ‘His Afflicted Mind’ is characterised by its simplicity, making it accessible to a broad audience. However, readers should be prepared to encounter a few grammatical errors throughout the book. For example, on page 105, the sentence reads, “She is more precious that life itself,” and on page 212, “I cannot to do this.” These errors disrupted the flow of the story and detracted from the emotional impact the book was striving to convey. It’s unfortunate, as more attention from the author and editor could have ensured a more polished reading experience. _____His Afflicted MindAuthor: Prabigyan Aryal Publisher: Daami Year: 2019Pages: 218 \nChildSafeNet (CSN), in collaboration with UNICEF Nepal, launched a situation paper titled “Nepal’s Digital Generation: Challenges and Solutions for Child Online Protection” at an event in Lalitpur on Friday.The paper, developed after reviewing over 160 research reports and consulting with experts in online child protection, outlines strategies to create a secure digital environment for Nepali children.The launch event was attended by Nawal Kishore Sah Sudi, Minister for Women, Children, and Senior Citizens; Indra Devi Dhakal, Member Secretary of the National Child Rights Council; Jee Hyun Rah, UNICEF Nepal Representative; and Anil Raghuvanshi, founder of ChildSafeNet.Themed “A Safer Digital World: Navigating Risks, Safeguarding Children,” the event emphasised the importance of plans and policies to ensure safe internet usage for children. Participants included children, government officials, advocates, and media representatives.Minister Sah Sudi reaffirmed the government’s commitment to child online safety. “We are dedicated to creating a secure digital space for children through policy reforms, enforcement mechanisms, and education campaigns,” he said.UNICEF’s Jee Hyun Rah highlighted the dual nature of internet exposure, stating, “While the internet offers immense opportunities, it also exposes children to significant risks like cyberbullying, sexual abuse, and identity theft. This situation demands urgent collective action.”The event featured a panel discussion, where child representative Abhinay Chauhan questioned key stakeholders, including Anil Raghuvanshi and Indra Devi Dhakal, about their efforts to combat online threats.Raghuvanshi stressed the need for increased budgets to educate children and combat issues like cyber exploitation and hate speech, while panellists committed to making the digital world safer.The discussion also touched on the growing role of generative AI in worsening online risks, further underscoring the urgency of addressing digital safety for children. \nThe Supreme Court has shattered yet another attempt by the CPN (Maoist Centre) to institutionalise its “people’s war”.A year after “scrapping” the decision of the erstwhile Pushpa Kamal Dahal-led government to announce a public holiday to mark the launch of the Maoists’ decade-long “people’s war’ in 1996, the top court has issued an order not to use ‘janayuddha’ in government documents.Issuing an interim order in a writ petition filed by Advocate Gyanendra Aran, the Constitutional Bench has directed the federal and Madhesh provincial governments not to use it until the final verdict. Aran, who also is a victim of the Maoist insurgency, had challenged the government's decision to include the term in official documents, saying it had glorified the killings and violence.The text of the ruling from last week was made public on Thursday.The national budget presented by Barshaman Pun, finance minister in the erstwhile Dahal government, on May 28 for the current fiscal year mentions “people’s war”. Similarly, the Madhesh Province’s fiscal budget for 2024-25 also mentions the term. The court says that the use of “people’s war” is against the spirit of the preamble of the Constitution of Nepal and its Article 42 (5). Instead of “people’s war”, the Article uses ‘armed conflict’ to refer to the Maoist insurgency. A five-member bench led by Chief Justice Prakash Man Singh Raut also cited how the Constitutional Committee of the Constituent Assembly on January 3, 2010, had rejected the terminology proposal.During eight years of constitution drafting, the Maoist Centre invested all its effort to put the term into the constitution. However, the former insurgents were unsuccessful as the rest of the parties stood against it. It took several sittings and days for the parties to agree that the issues which cannot be decided with consensus would be put to a vote.The “people's war” was one such contentious issue that was put to vote but was rejected by the majority. ‘Armed conflict’ has been in official use to indicate the 1996-2006 insurgency. The Maoist Centre leadership has spoken against the top court’s ruling saying that banning the term is against the democratic spirit.“I heard you [people’s war] are banned; perhaps they want to lock you in a cold cellar knowing that you are a spokesperson for social justice,” Janardan Sharma, a Maoist Centre’s deputy general secretary, wrote on Facebook. “A ban is a mockery of democracy. The people’s war—you have been banned.”Now the same constitutional bench will conduct final hearing on the case before passing a verdict. This is the second time in a year the top court shot down the attempt of the third largest party to institutionalise “people's war”.On December 28 last year, the Supreme Court annulled the government’s decision to declare Falgun 1 a public holiday as the ‘People's War Day’.A division bench of justices Anand Mohan Bhattarai and Mahesh Sharma Paudel had quashed the government’s decision on a public holiday while responding to a writ petition by various individuals, including Advocate Aran.The government in February 2023 had announced a public holiday to commemorate the ‘People’s War Day’ despite reservations from a coalition partner. The Rastriya Prajatantra Party then refused to attend the Cabinet meeting, expressing displeasure with the decision.The rebellion that started on February 13, 1996, concluded following a Comprehensive Peace Agreement on November 21, 2006.The Maoists, who led the insurgency, observe the first day of the Nepali month of Falgun as the People’s War Day every year. However, other political forces see the marking of the day as a public holiday as a glorification of the conflict—and hence unacceptable. \nEven if CPN-UML is leading the government, its eyes appear to be trained on the upcoming election.While some political analysts argue that the party should be more focussed on delivering from its position of power, others say it should be taken as natural for a political party in a democracy.After facing poor results during the by-elections held earlier this month, the party recently passed six resolutions aiming to become the largest in the 2027 general elections.The resolutions were passed during a two-day workshop in Kathmandu that concluded on Sunday and was attended by in-charges, presidents, and secretaries of provincial, district, and fraternal organisations. The workshop aimed to make the party organisation more dynamic and connect with the people.Aiming to give the party decisive political power, it has also announced a three-month campaign at the ward level starting on January 16.The workshop concluded that although UML hopes to become the largest party through the 2027 elections, the party committees, in their current form, were ineffective and not well-positioned to achieve that goal. The workshop also decided to intensify the organisation-strengthening campaign.All these moves indicate that the UML is currently more focussed on the 2027 elections than on governing.Political historian Rajesh Gautam finds it unnatural that instead of focusing on delivery and addressing the growing public disenchantment towards political parties, the ruling political party is focusing on the next election.“What makes one believe that political parties that have failed to deliver good governance at present will do so after the next election?” Gautam questions.Gautam stressed that since political parties do not have a specific plan and vision, they are making lofty plans to engage their cadres.The UML came in second in the local and federal elections held in 2022. For a brief time, the party was also in the government led by CPN (Maoist Centre) chair Pushpa Kamal Dahal, formed soon after the November 2022 federal and provincial elections.However, when the Maoist Centre changed its coalition partner, joining hands with the Nepali Congress, the UML was relegated to the opposition party at both the federal and provincial governments. But the party got back in power on March 4, first collaborating with the Maoist Centre as a coalition partner and later with Congress, following the July 1 midnight agreement.Whether in the government or the opposition, the UML’s focus appears to lie on the upcoming election.Chandra Dev Bhatta, a political analyst, says that a political party focusing on the upcoming election should be taken as natural; it is their long-term political plan.“Since the election result 2022 delivered a hung Parliament, no political party can single-handedly lead the government now,” Bhatta said. “Political parties are focussing on the upcoming election to avoid that situation.”After the UML realised that its strength was diminishing after conducting the mid-hill highway-centric political campaign last year, it is now giving its full attention to strengthening its party organisation, Bhatta said. The party had expected a positive result in the just-concluded local-level by-election; however, the result was contrary to its expectations, which forced it to focus rigorously on the upcoming election.“But it is not only the UML that is concentrating on the next election,” Bhatta added. “Other major political parties like Congress and Maoist Centre are also organising various programmes aimed at the next election.”The UML had launched a mid-hill highway-centric political campaign in December last year, aiming to interact with the local communities in 26 districts connected by the highway. UML then organised 30 mass assemblies and interacted with locals through over 100 gatherings during the two-week-long tour.The campaign, which started in Jhulaghat of Baitadi on December 1, concluded 17 days later when it reached Chiwabhanjyang in the far-eastern part of the country.Before this, in February 2023, UML also organised a ‘Mission Grassroots’ campaign to strengthen the party's ideological organisation, which was also focused on the next election. If every political party focuses on the upcoming election, what will become of the current people’s mandate delivered through the 2022 election?“When political parties are not ideologically bound, they are permanently looking forward to the next election,” said CK Lal, another political expert. “This is what’s currently happening in Nepal.”Lal further said that when political parties fail to improve their performances, their only motive is to win the election based on their organisational strength.But Jhalak Subedi, a political analyst, says that consolidating the party's strength is a regular political process that has nothing to do with the earlier election mandate.Political parties might have felt a gap in connecting with the public, so they plan different campaigns to connect with the public, Subedi says. “These campaigns should not be considered otherwise.” \nPreparations are on to call the winter session of the federal parliament from the first week of January, amid the opposition's claims that the government wants to push back the session.Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli, Speaker Devraj Ghimire, and Minister for Law, Justice and Parliamentary Affairs Ajay Chaurasiya held informal discussions on Friday to take stock of the bills that may be presented before lawmakers. The budget session of Parliament was prorogued on September 17, weeks before the major festival began, without enough bills to work on. “Discussions are ongoing to ensure the upcoming session has adequate business. We want the House committees to finalise some of the bills while the government will also register new bills by the time the new session commences,” Chaurasiya told the Post. As per the records at the parliament secretariat, 20 bills are with the parliamentary committees.Several of them have been pending for over a year as the committees failed to finalise them. Five bills are under consideration in the Finance Committee, while the State Affairs and Good Governance Committee has four bills to decide on. Similarly, the Infrastructure Development Committee; the Education, Health and Information Committee; and the Law, Justice and Human Rights Committee have at least one bill each to discuss and finalise.At least twice in the last two months, Ghimire has asked the chairpersons of the committees under the House of Representatives and the National Assembly, in the presence of the party chief whips, to finalise the bills and send them to the full House. However, the committees have not finalised a single bill so far. Chauriya said there will be no dearth of business if the committees pass some pending bills while the government will also register some new ones. The government has not registered any bills since July. “Our ministry is reviewing different bills drafted by various ministries,” said Chaurasiya, the parliamentary affairs minister. Draft bills related to splitting of the Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal, integrated election laws, and amendments to the Nepal Police Act, among others, are under consideration.The Cabinet must endorse the bills drafted by various ministries before being registered in Parliament. Such bills are first discussed in the full House and then sent to the respective committees to streamline the amendments. They must get through both chambers and receive the presidential seal before becoming a law.Officials at the parliament secretariat say the government is under pressure to summon an early session amid fears that the opposition could demand a special session. “We have heard that the opposition might demand a special session, claiming the government wants to push back the winter session,” said a senior official at the secretariat. “However, to my knowledge, there have been discussions between the government and the Speaker for the new session. It should start in a few weeks.”Speaking at a party event last week, Dahal claimed that the Oli government was unwilling to call the winter session because it was afraid of facing criticism. The main opposition is looking for a platform to criticise the government, claiming it was promoting corruption and shielding the corrupt. Similarly, the Rastriya Swatantra Party, which says the government was targeting its president by prolonging his corruption trial, too is waiting for the opportunity to attack the government.One fourth of lawmakers of the 275-strong lower house can petition the President for a special session of Parliament.The last winter session commenced on February 5. The President summons and prorogues Parliament on the government’s recommendation. There cannot be a gap bigger than six months between two sessions.Several bills have yet to be passed for a full-fledged implementation of the new constitution. A subpanel under the Legislation Management Committee of the National Assembly reported that the government still needs to prepare 39 bills. The five-member subpanel led by Beduram Bhusal has accused successive governments of paying little attention to making legal arrangements necessary for the charter’s full implementation. Seven governments led by the Nepali Congress, the CPN-UML and the CPN (Maoist Centre) have been formed since the promulgation of the constitution in 2015. \nAs various ethnic groups raising their voice for identity-based nomenclature of Koshi Province prepare to resume their agitation, the provincial government is considering holding talks with them.The provincial government has formed a talks team weeks after the groups dissatisfied with the province’s nomenclature announced a ‘new and decisive’ agitation.On November 18, the Province 1 Renaming Joint Struggle Committee had held a press conference to announce the movement.Nearly a month later, on Thursday, the provincial government formed a three-member dialogue committee led by Minister for Economic Affairs and Planning Ram Bahadur Magar. Internal Affairs and Law Minister Rewati Raman Bhandari and Minister for Physical Infrastructure Development Bhupendra Rai are its members while the secretary of the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Law serves as its member-secretary.A provincial assembly meeting had named Province 1 as Koshi on March 1 last year. The name, proposed by the CPN-UML, was endorsed by an overwhelming majority, with assembly members from the Nepali Congress, the CPN (Maoist Centre), and the Rastriya Prajatantra Party (RPP) voting in its favour.But the nomenclature did not sit well with various ethnic groups that had been demanding the province be named after the ethnic identity of the dominant communities residing in the province. The groups then took to the streets against the nomenclature.Amid this, on December 8, members of the struggle committee tried to show a black flag, as a symbolic protest, to Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli while he was visiting his home district of Jhapa.Minister for Internal Affairs and Law Bhandari said that there are various issues related to community, identity and ethnicity that have emerged in the province and may arise in the future as well. “The dialogue committee will find solutions to these issues through negotiations in line with the constitution and laws,” he said.The dialogue team has yet to start its work. As Sunday is a public holiday, the committee is likely to hold a formal meeting with the agitating groups on Monday, Bhandari said.“We can talk jointly or separately with different groups—it will be determined by the terms of reference (ToR) that our committee formulates,” Minister Bhandari added. “At present, at least eight to nine groups are protesting by taking up identity issues.”The agitating groups have also been demanding that Maithili be designated the official language of the province, Minister Bhandari said.But Govinda Chhantyal, an identity-based rights activist, differs with the minister. “The identity movement has been raising the issue of language long before the issue of naming the Koshi emerged,” he said.“While the government recognised 12 official languages, Limbu and Maithili were recognised as the official languages ​​of Koshi Province,” Chhantyal added. “We have since then been linking the language issue with the identity movement.”In 2021, the language commission submitted its report to then President Bidya Devi Bhandari and then Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba, recommending 12 languages, including Nepali, as official languages.Koshi Provincial Assembly member from Nepali Congress Shamsher Rai emphasises the importance of resolving outstanding issues through dialogue. The previous government held talks with the agitating groups twice. Although the talks had progressed positively, the change of government at the centre and the province later affected them, Rai said.“Both sides should opt for dialogue,” Rai said.Prem Yakten, coordinator of the struggle committee accused the current provincial government of ignoring the problem.“If the government ignores our movement, we will intensify it in other provinces too,” coordinator Yatken said. “The main agenda of our protest is to rename the Koshi Province.”Soon after the provincial assembly named the province as Koshi, the agitating groups started disruptive activities. Authorities had to announce prohibitory orders in the province for a few days.Upon reaching an agreement on February 9 with the Kedar Karki-led government, the agitating groups had halted their protests. They later contested in the subsequent by-election held in Ilam-2.In the April by-election held to elect a federal lawmaker from Ilam-2, two activists of the Province-1 Renaming Joint Struggle Committee—Dakendra Limbu and Milan Limbu—contested the seats. Dakendra fought as an independent candidate while Milan contested as a candidate from the Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP). Dakendra secured third position with 11,457 votes; CPN-UML’s Suhang Nemwang, the son of former Speaker late Subas Nembang, won the election.“The by-election held earlier this year boosted our confidence and the election result justified our movement,” Yakten said.“We had reached a five-point agreement with the Kedar Karki-led government,” Yakten said. “The government’s dialogue committee had then agreed to take political initiatives to resolve the issue of renaming the Koshi Province.” According to him, the provincial government had agreed to fund the treatment of those injured during the agitation and compensate the families of those who died in it.“The government committee had vowed to start the process of releasing those in prison and withdrawing cases of those charged of vandalism,” Yakten said. “But none of the agreements were implemented, compelling us to hit the street again.”Yakten says that they have come up with an alternative name for the province.“Earlier, supporters of identity-based nomenclature had suggested alternate names for the Bagmati Province and Gandaki Province as well but they were ignored,” Yakten added. “Even now, they accuse us of not having an alternative name. We have it but we won’t make it public until the government is ready to change the name.” \nThe Kathmandu Metropolitan City has announced that it will start random on-the-spot emission testing of vehicles on the road beginning next week.The move of the city office comes amid deteriorating air quality in Kathmandu Valley.“We have provided necessary training to two mechanical engineers, who will be deployed for emission testing,” said Jagatman Shrestha, traffic expert adviser at the metropolis. “We have also coordinated with the environment department of the federal government, traffic police, and the department of transport management to start these tests.”The city office has purchased two smoke meters (a portable device for testing vehicle emissions)—one for diesel vehicles and the other for petrol vehicles—to carry out emission testing. Officials say, for the first time, motorcycles and scooters will also be tested.Though vehicle emission testing is mainly the responsibility of federal government agencies, the constitution also mandates local governments to take measures to reduce pollution, officials say.The metropolis has developed pollution control guidelines as per the KMC Environment and Natural Resources Protection Act-2021.Officials say these random tests will be conducted on vehicles that have passed emission testing from the department of transport management and received green stickers, as all four-wheelers on the road typically do. However, some may still emit black smoke for various reasons, including lack of timely servicing and maintenance.Many automobile owners only service their vehicles ahead of the annual pollution testing. “We will not issue green stickers to vehicles but check emission levels,” said Shrestha. “If we find vehicles emitting pollutants more than permissible levels, we will slap a fine.”According to the officials, Rs1,000 will be fined for polluting vehicles for the first time.Random vehicle testing is among the measures the city office is taking to tackle air pollution.The municipal environment department has also started monitoring the city’s air quality independently. For that, the city office has installed portable devices in various locations. “We have already installed portable air quality monitoring devices in 16 locations within the metropolis and are preparing to install three more,” said Sarita Rai, chief of the department. “We have also launched a drive to make people aware of air pollution.”Nepal’s air quality reaches hazardous levels several times a year, and the capital city often becomes the world’s most polluted metropolis.According to IQ AirVisual, a Swiss group that collects air quality data from around the world, Kathmandu’s PM2.5 levels reached 197 micrograms per cubic metre (μg/m3) on Friday afternoon.PM2.5 refers to particulate matter (solid or liquid droplets) in the air that is less than 2.5 micrometres in diameter. It is among the most dangerous pollutants that can get past the nose and throat to penetrate the lungs and get into the bloodstream. PM2.5 particles are small and likely to stay suspended in the air for long, increasing the chances of people inhaling them.As per the Environmental Protection Agency’s air quality index, when air quality reaches 151-200, it is considered unhealthy; everyone may experience problems, with sensitive groups feeling more severe effects.Major hospitals report a spike in respiratory problems due to the impact of toxic air and dust. Meanwhile, the city office said it had installed push-button traffic lights in 36 locations for the ease of pedestrians. “We are working to bring those devices into operation soon,” said Shrestha, traffic adviser of the metropolis. “Pedestrians can push the button to stop traffic and cross the road safely.”Push-button devices are installed at traffic intersections to allow pedestrians to request stop road traffic, so that they can cross the road without fear. \nNepali Congress candidate Krishnaman Dangol has been elected mayor of Kirtipur Municipality in the by-election held on Sunday. Dangol secured 5,334 votes, defeating his closest rival, Shivsharan Maharjan of the Maoist Centre, by 779 votes.Maharjan received 4,555 votes, while Surendra Manandhar of the CPN-UML garnered 4,337 votes.The by-election was held following the demise of former mayor Rajkumar Nakarmi, who passed away on July 26 last year due to a kidney-related illness. Nakarmi, also from the Congress, was elected Mayor in the 2022 local elections.Kirtipur, historically known as a left-leaning stronghold, saw a shift in political dynamics with Nakarmi’s victory in 2022. Kirtipur was declared a municipality in 1997. \nKrishnaman Dangol of the Nepali Congress has maintained a lead in the ongoing vote count for the mayor of Kirtipur Municipality. As of the latest tally, Dangol has garnered 789 votes, while Surendra Manandhar of the CPN-UML trails with 666 votes. Shivsharan Maharjan of the CPN (Maoist Centre) has received 465 votes. Among independent candidates, Rajman Maharjan has secured 418 votes, Dinesh Kumar Adhikari 236, and Kabikumar Maharjan 58. Rastriya Prajatantra Party’s Dhruba Maharjan has obtained 119 votes, while Bhanu Rijal of the CPN (Unified Socialist) has 22 votes.   \nRojina Shrestha of the Rastriya Swatantra Party has been elected ward chair of Kathmandu Metropolitan City-16, securing 2,902 votes.According to the Election Commission, Laxmiratna Tuladhar of the UML came second with 2,220 votes, while Congress candidate Devendra Pathak finished third with 2,214 votes. Unified Socialist’s Min Bahadur Manandhar received 1,092 votes, and Shyam Krishna Shrestha of the Rastriya Prajatantra Party secured 774 votes. A total of 10,558 votes were cast, with 180 declared invalid. The by-election was held following the death of Mukunda Rijal, elected ward chair in 2022 with 4,018 votes from Congress. \nA man accused of threatening Nepali businesspersons by claiming to be a member of the Indian criminal gang Lawrence Bishnoi, has been arrested. The arrested is Harichandra Phuyal alias Navin Pradhan, 36, a resident of Panchthar, and currently residing in ward 13 of Mechinagar Municipality, Jhapa.According to police, Phuyal used Indian phone numbers to make calls and send messages to businesspersons, claiming to represent the gang. He allegedly terrorised them by demanding they apologise to controversial medical entrepreneur Durga Prasai, warning of dire consequences, including threats to their lives. The Central Investigation Bureau (CIB) apprehended Pradhan in Charaali, Jhapa, on Wednesday evening. Police investigations revealed that Pradhan acted under Prasai’s instructions. Authorities said Pradhan has a history of criminal involvement and was previously on the run. Two mobile phones were seized during the arrest, and further investigation is ongoing.  \nIn Majhthana, a remote hill station in Kaski district, Chandra Kanta Ghimire, a returnee migrant, wakes up early to cook khole (a soup of maize flour and vegetables) to feed his buffaloes. He has minimal green fodder, so he supplements their diet with a mixture of dry straw.Ghimire owns 10 Murrah buffalos. These water buffaloes originate in Haryana and Punjab, India and are mainly known for producing a high volume of milk. Until recently, he had no idea about the buffalo meat export prospects.Eleven months ago, he took another Rs2.3 million loan and added more buffaloes. “I spent Rs600,000 to erect a shed and have decided to add two buffaloes this year.”Ghimire said that a Murrah buffalo costs around Rs170,000. “I milk 50 litres a day, making a monthly income of Rs147,000 by selling it at Rs115 per litre,” said Ghimire, who dreams of buying a car with the income in four or five years. The 51-year-old farmer recently bought a washing machine. Ghimire said he hasn’t considered rearing buffalo for meat. “But I have heard it’s rewarding,” Ghimire told the Post last month. Commercial buffalo rearing for meat purposes is limited in Nepal, and the export of buffalo meat is negligible. This week, on Monday, Beijing opened a trade prospect for the meat industry, apart from traditional handicraft products, which Nepal has been exporting to its northern neighbour for decades.During Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli’s recent visit to China on December 2, Beijing surprised Nepal by opening its doors to water buffalo meat. On social media platforms, many users pointed out that during then Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal’s trip to New Delhi in May, his counterpart gifted 15 Murrah buffaloes to Nepal, while Prime Minister Oli travelled to China and agreed to sell buffalo meat. But for Nepal’s ailing agricultural sector, this Chinese initiative represents a huge prospect and may significantly help the country’s graduation from least developed country (LDC). As per the statistics, if the buffalo meat export materialises, it could surpass the total export earnings from the 32 high-value goods identified by Nepal Trade Integration Strategy (NTIS), which totalled Rs110.38 billion in the last fiscal year. The trade strategy was revised last fiscal year to support Nepal’s graduation from the LDC status to a developing country by 2026.On December 16, Himalayan Food International, a private company in Nepal, and Shanghai Ziyan Food, a company in China, inked a business-to-business agreement in Kathmandu to export buffalo meat.“Immediately after the successful visit of Rt Hon PM and agreement on Buffalo meat export to China. The game-changing MOU of Strategic Cooperation for Nepal Thermally Processed Buffalo Meat Products Export Project to China is inked today, which has opened over 100 billion rupees in the buffalo farming industry in Nepal, benefitting tens of thousands of rural families. Congratulations to both our people,” Chinese Ambassador to Nepal Chen Song wrote on X.Beijing is employing soft trade diplomacy to buy $1.5 billion worth of buffalo meat from Nepal in a year, terming the project a game-changer.Experts say that’s a big opportunity for Nepal, whose annual export to China is Rs2.58 billion. The meat Beijing has sought from Nepal accounts for almost 66 percent of Nepal’s annual imports from China, which total $2.21 billion.But challenges galore.“China may offer technical help to build a processing facility for this purpose,” said Mahanand Joshi, a senior agri-economist at the Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock Development. “A Nepali private company will export $1.5 billion of buffalo meat annually, depending on Nepal’s production. The government will invest to increase buffalo production accordingly.” “To meet the target of $1.5 billion, we need to meet the technical standard for export, and work will be expedited for this purpose.”However, Nepal’s present buffalo population can’t even meet the high domestic market demands, and insiders say buffalos are brought in large numbers from India.The buffalo meat industry of Nepal is still experiencing a market gap due to the demand-supply mismatch. The Beijing initiative opens new opportunities for entrepreneurs to fill the gap.The total meat production in Nepal peaked at 552,156 tonnes in 2019-20 due to the Covid pandemic, when people started to take an extra protein diet to fight the virus.However, production gradually dropped to 520,742 tonnes in 2020-21 and 512,788 tonnes in 2021-22. The production fell sharply to 430,085 tonnes in 2022-23, which experts attributed to an exodus of Nepali youth, the key population who loved eating meat. Government statistics show that labour permits and student visas were issued for nearly a million Nepalis in 2022-23. Buffalo meat, which represents 27 percent of total meat production in Nepal and has 20.23 grams of protein content per 100 grams, higher than other types of meat, rose to 189,517 tonnes in 2019-20. Production fell to 188,172 tonnes in 2020-21 and peaked at a time high of 194,090 tonnes in 2021-22. The output then shrank to a nearly two-and-a-half-decade low of 116,503 tonnes in 2022-23.The population of live buffalos, which was 3.70 million heads two decades ago, reached 5.30 million heads in 2018-19, the highest count. But since, the population has decreased, reaching a three-decade low of 3.08 million heads in 2022-23.Government officials see the Beijing initiative as a game changer for Nepal’s livestock sector.Sudhir Kumar Singh, information officer at the Department of Livestock Services, believes Nepal can meet the Chinese demand.“As demand for buffalo meat has declined, farmers too were discouraged. But if there is a trade prospect, commercial farming may thrive again.”Livestock traders say it is a day-dream. “Domestic production is not enough to meet domestic demand. We estimate that nearly 70 percent of buffaloes in Nepal are imported from India illegally to meet the buff demand,” said Jiban Khatiwada, president of the Nepal Livestock Traders Association. “In this scenario, immediately exporting buffalo meat in such a large amount is impossible.” Ghimire, the farmer in Kaski, says he didn’t import buffaloes from India. “A group of agents smuggle them. It’s not possible to bring Murrah buffalos from India legally.”Nepal has become self-reliant in goat and chicken production but not in buffalo.However, Navin Kumar Sharma, chairman of Himalayan Food International, is optimistic about the ambitious agreement. “But it will take some time.”“It is feasible to export $1.5 billion worth of buffalo meat to China by 2027-28 if we aggressively start rearing buffalo. We will start exporting 500 tonnes, as per our target. For this, we need to slaughter 5,000 buffaloes daily,” said Sharma.Chinese investors will put in Rs27 billion in two projects. Investment of Rs21 billion will be mobilised for buffalo rearing in three locations: Hariharpur Gadhi in Sindhuli, Ilam and Madi of Chitwan. Similarly, under the project, a Rs6 billion processing plant will be set up in Hariharpur Gadhi. Chinese investors are scheduled to inspect the factory in six months.“So, by the time they come, we must keep 40,000 buffalo calves. The Chinese investors have given us a target of rearing 200,000 buffalo heads in a year,” said Sharma. “We have to ensure that the buffalo meat originates in Nepal, but we will be exempted from the origin certificate for the first two years.”Sharma said he was exporting buffalo meat to Vietnam until the pre-Covid period, which then used to be re-exported to China. Buffalo is being produced primarily in Tarai areas. It takes two years for a calf to become mature for meat production.Khatiwada said people rear buffalo for milk, but as buffalo milk production is low, farmers focused on milk production have shifted to cow rearing. Also, it is comparatively easier to rear cows than buffaloes.Khatiwada said any increase in production depends on the government’s policy. “Once buffalo meat starts being exported to China, its price will rise domestically due to the push in demand. This might also encourage more farmers to start buffalo rearing,” he said.“But whatever the case, this project is undeniably ambitious.” \n**Summarize the major events in 1 line without losing crucial information.**\nCash-strapped Dairy Development Corporation signs agreement to supply raw cheese to private company for cash flow amid financial struggles.\nThe MG Winter Carnival 2024 at Silver Oak, Baluwatar, Kathmandu, will showcase luxury automobiles from MG, Mazda, Maxus, and Wuling, offering exclusive exchange offers, financing options, test drives, and live entertainment.\nNepal confirms second monkeypox case, a 36-year-old migrant worker who returned from Saudi Arabia, leading to contact tracing efforts.\nNepal postpones malaria elimination target to 2030 due to ineffective containment efforts and isolated indigenous cases emerging as a major challenge.\nNepal received 460,940 doses of HPV vaccine for a nationwide vaccination drive to reduce cervical cancer, with 1.7 million doses required for the first phase starting February 5th.\nA few days ago, a five-year-old boy from Kathmandu was rushed to the emergency ward of the Kanti Children's Hospital for a respiratory illness. Doctors said the boy had been suffering from an acute lower tract infection, decreased lung function, and asthma.“Respiratory viruses, including influenza and others, become more active during the winter season,” said Dr Sumit Agrawal, the hospital spokesperson. “The rise in the air pollution levels has further exacerbated the problems.”This has become a common refrain among the hundreds of children suffering from respiratory illness, as the air quality in the country continues to decline.Doctors say respiratory viruses—influenza A(H1N1), A(H3), influenza B, rhinovirus, coronaviruses, and adenoviruses, among others—are generally more active during winter. But what alarmed them is that studies show children in Kathmandu Valley are highly exposed to air pollution, which could worsen respiratory and other problems.A recent study carried out by the Nepal Health Research Council shows that children in Kathmandu Valley have been highly exposed to air pollution.“They are exposed to air pollution while commuting to and from school,” said Dr Megnath Dhimal, chief researcher at the Council. “Those travelling by scooter to and from school are at risk even more.”According to the report, KN95 masks block 50 to 70 percent of pollution particles, but most children do not wear these masks. Parents, too, are often not aware of the risks. Moreover, children do not know how to wear face masks properly.With the start of the dry season, air quality, mostly in highly dense cities, including the Kathmandu Valley, has been worsening. IQ AirVisual, a Swiss group that collects air-quality data from around the world, has ranked Kathmandu among the world’s 10 most polluted cities several times in recent days. PM2.5 refers to particulate matter (solid or liquid droplets) in the air that is less than 2.5 micrometres in diameter. It is among the most dangerous pollutants that can get past the nose and throat to penetrate the lungs and even the bloodstream. PM2.5 particles are small and are also likely to stay suspended in the air for long, increasing the chances of people inhaling them.Doctors say poor air quality can cause short- and long-term effects on public health. In the short term, it can lead to pneumonia, bronchitis, conjunctivitis, skin allergy, stroke, and heart problems, and in the long run, it can lead to severe conditions like ulcers, cancer of the lungs and intestine, kidney disease, and heart complications.“The increase in the sale of inhalers and nebulisers for children is also a clear sign of how serious the problem has become,” said Dr Ganesh Rai, former director at the Kanti Children Hospital. “The number of cases of respiratory illness in children has risen by 50 percent in the last 10 years and 100 percent in 20 years.”Studies show people in low- and middle-income countries get disproportionately affected by polluted air, which is responsible for more than 90 percent of deaths in these countries, according to the World Health Organisation.Several studies carried out in the past in Nepal also showed that toxic air takes a huge toll on public health. Along with respiratory illness, the toxic air has led to severe conditions like ulcers, cancer of the lungs and intestine, kidney disease, heart complications, high blood pressure and stroke, according to experts.Past studies also show that polluted air has been shortening people’s lives. Nepali lives are being cut short by around five years, according to a report by the Air Quality Life Index (AQLI), which converts air pollution concentration into an impact on life expectancy. AQLI is a metric produced by the Energy Policy Institute at the University of Chicago.Toxic air is deadlier than tobacco use and high blood pressure, which reduce life by 2.8 years and 1.7 years, respectively, according to the report.Public health measures—mask-wearing, handwashing, avoiding crowds, and maintaining social distancing—can reduce infection, according to doctors. \nAs the deadline to eliminate malaria approaches, cases of new infections—both indigenous and imported—have risen alarmingly in Nepal.Nepal had committed to achieving ‘malaria-free’ status by 2026. For this, the country needs to bring down indigenous cases or local transmission to zero, achieve zero deaths starting from 2023, and maintain zero indigenous cases for three consecutive years.However, the country has failed to bring down indigenous cases to zero in both 2023 and 2024.Instead, cases of infections–both Indigenous and imported have risen alarmingly, which shattered any prospects of eliminating the disease within the deadline.“Only 16 cases of local transmission or indigenous cases were confirmed in 2023, but we already have more than 20 cases this year,” said Dr Gokarna Dahal, chief of the Vector Control Section at the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division. “We had 649 imported cases in 2023, but in 2024, the number could reach 1,000.”Malaria is caused by Plasmodium parasites. Infected female Anopheles mosquitoes carry these deadly parasites, according to the World Health Organisation. Indigenous malaria cases are locally transmitted, meaning the infected person does not have a history of travel to a malaria-affected country. Officials say that the number of indigenous cases of malaria infection could rise further, as concerned health authorities have been verifying the reports.“Now, it is impossible to meet the malaria elimination target, as we could not stop local transmission,” said Dr Yadu Chandra Ghimire, director of the division. “The new deadline for disease elimination could be 2030, the final deadline set by the UN health body.”Officials say that open borders, budget cuts in the health sector, and mosquitoes moving to higher altitudes due to climate change have hindered Nepal’s malaria elimination goal.They say that of the total imported cases, over 80 percent came from India. Some cases were imported from African countries. Nepali security personnel serving in UN peacekeeping missions in conflict-hit African countries also get tested positive for malaria.Officials say the disease is unlikely to be eliminated in Nepal unless India eliminates it first. They say that due to proximity, and an open and porous border between Nepal and India and unregulated travel of people of both countries, it is impossible to eliminate malaria in Nepal, until the disease gets eradicated in the southern neighbour.Several other factors, including cuts in the health budgets of government and aid agencies and shifts in vectors transmitting malaria to the hills and mountains due to global warming, also pose serious challenges to meeting the elimination target. Apart from this, most health facilities across the country lack entomologists, who are necessary for conducting surveillance. Malaria has also been reported in mountain districts of Mugu, Bajura, and Humla, which were considered non-endemic in the past. Officials say carrying out surveillance in the hill and mountain districts is more challenging than in the Tarai districts due to geographical difficulties.According to Health Ministry officials improved surveillance measures could be a reason for the detection of more cases of infections.Malaria-related deaths had stopped since 2016, but five years later, in 2021, the country recorded one death from the disease.Officials at the health ministry said that until recent years, Plasmodium Vivax, a protozoan parasite, had been responsible for most of the malaria cases in the country, which caused relatively less severe diseases. However, cases of Plasmodium falciparum, which most often cause severe and life-threatening malaria, have been rising. The parasite is common in many countries in Africa and the Sahara desert. \nThe Kathmandu Metropolitan City (KMC) has imposed a fine of Rs200,000 on Bhatbhateni Supermarket in Tripureshwar for selling substandard products. The Department of Agriculture and Livestock, under KMC, found mold in packaged food items during an inspection prompted by customer complaints.Dr Awadhesh Jha, an inspection officer from the department, stated that the KMC call centre received complaints alleging the sale of “expired, rotten, and pest-infested food” at the store. Following the inspection, 44 packets of coconuts were found to contain mold, leading to their destruction on Friday and the subsequent fine imposed on the supermarket.In an official statement, KMC emphasised the importance of adhering to food safety regulations, saying, “The penalty amount must be deposited into the city’s revenue account. Moving forward, ensure that all items sold comply with Nepal’s laws and maintain high-quality standards fit for consumption.” \nNepal Foods has been named Best Nepali Brand of the Year 2024 at the 9th Asian Food and Restaurant Awards International, held at the Royal Ascot. The event recognised excellence in the culinary industry, celebrating cultural diversity and innovation.The awards are known for highlighting outstanding contributions to the UK’s food sector. Nepal Foods’ achievement reflects its commitment to quality and authenticity in Nepalese cuisine.Bikash Nepal, Director of Nepal Foods, expressed pride in receiving the award, stating, “This recognition celebrates our efforts to promote Nepali culture and cuisine globally. It’s a testament to the dedication of our team.”With products available in the USA, Canada, Australia, Europe, and Japan, Nepal Foods continues to showcase Nepali gastronomy on an international stage. \nDusit Princess Kathmandu is organising a five-day trout festival at its SOI restaurant. The dishes will be available for order from 12:30 pm to 10:00 pm every day till August 30. In celebration of Nepal’s rivers and lakes, which provide an ideal environment for high-quality trout, the Director of Culinary Food and Beverage Service, Chef Utpal Mondal, and his team at Dusit Princess Kathmandu have crafted a menu showcasing the flavours and versatility of locally sourced trout. “As the festive month of Shrawan ends, people focus on healthy and nutritious food. Trout, rich in omega-3 fatty acids, vitamins, and essential minerals, offers a heart-friendly option that checks all the boxes from a nutritional and culinary standpoint,” says Mondal.He adds that the goal of the culinary event is to offer their guests a rare opportunity to experience a wide variety of trout dishes they wouldn’t typically find at home.The event menu features twelve unique dishes, six of which are drawn from diverse culinary traditions across continents. Three dishes are inspired by oriental cuisine, while the remaining three highlight flavours from Nepal and India. The menu has been designed to include various dishes, from soups and starters to main courses, including Mexican, Italian, Continental, and Thai flavours.While discussing the event’s highlights, Mondal said, “The celebration presents a unique opportunity for guests to indulge in a diverse range of trout-based dishes, something they wouldn’t typically have the chance to experience elsewhere.” \nI can vividly remember my first encounter with baking when I was 10 years old. We had just moved to our new home and got a cable connection. The cable opened a world of possibilities, as it gave me access to various contents.This was back in the late 2000s when YouTube would take hours to load, taunting us with its buffering screen. I was particularly drawn to travel and lifestyle channels, mainly TLC, Fox Life, and Food Network, which kept me informed about different foods and cultures. I don’t know why, but I was always drawn to desserts. It was fascinating to see how these miraculous treats made people smile at the end of the meal.Growing up in Nepal, I noticed that baking wasn't very common. While some families did have ovens, they were mostly multifunctional ones used primarily for heating food.I also noticed that most of our desserts didn't require an oven, as they could be made on a stovetop. So, you can imagine my excitement when my mom decided to buy an oven during one of her festive shopping sprees.I could finally feel the joy these channels portrayed. (I blame food writer Nigella Lawson for getting me hooked on a domestic lifestyle.) Then, one day, after watching one of the cooking episodes on television, I finally mustered enough strength and decided to bake something. I distinctly remember wanting to make a chocolate cake for myself after watching one of Rachel Allen’s bake series. I watched all the ingredients used in that recipe and scurried across my pantry, only to realise I didn’t have half of the stuff she mentioned. I then decided to improvise the recipe (a big mistake). I randomly combined the ingredients that I had in a mixing bowl and chucked the batter into my oven, hoping for a magical cake to pop out an hour later.After I saw the result an hour later, I was mortified. The cake was stuck in the pan, refusing to come out, and it was as dense as fudge. I convinced myself that the taste was what mattered most, but when I served a slice to my brother, he made a face of utter disgust.That was the day I realised that baking soda was not the same as baking powder.After this incident, I researched baking and found out it was technical. This was a blessing in disguise for me, as I loved science, and I started to view baking as a science experiment. I then reflected and evaluated how to perfect one's baking skills.I analysed my errors and noted down all the steps I did every time I baked. Home baking is a passion for many. The idea of turning a few simple ingredients into a delicious masterpiece is as enchanting as it sounds.Yet, for many of us, this seemingly magical process can often turn into a series of unfortunate events, leading to crumbled dreams and deflated ambitions. Dense cakes, burnt crusts, rock-hard cookies and unrisen bread, if you are an amateur baker, then you have seen it all. But why do these mishaps happen so often? And most importantly how do we overcome them?From my experience, behind every successful bake lies a series of challenges and mishaps that test even the most dedicated bakers. Baking has its own set of rules that you need to follow to get that scrumptious treat every time. So, to transform a recipe into an actual dish that will impress your friends and family, I am sharing with you some of the tips and tricks I learned from my tumultuous journey as a home baker.First things first, we have to look into the prime appliance that we are working with. Commercial ovens are of two types: one that runs on gas and the other that runs on electricity. We have to look at the oven present at our home and consider its pros and cons. The main benefits of a gas oven are its size and temperature control. One can quickly change the temperature just by twisting the knob, and it preheats much more quickly than an electric one. However, they are known to have uneven temperatures at times and release more humidity, making it harder to properly crisp or brown food. This can result in burnt edges and cold or hot spots. An electric oven, on the other hand, provides more even and consistent temperatures and doesn’t release as much moisture in the air.This dry oven environment makes it easier to brown your items, making it great for baking bread. However, while the dry oven results in more even cooking, you also run the risk of drying out cakes and other baked goods.Also, many people forget to preheat the oven before baking, which is crucial for maintaining an even temperature throughout the baking process. When baking cakes and bread, I like to place a small tray of water at the bottom of the oven to provide moisture and prevent the baked goods from drying out.An oven thermometer can be a baker's best friend, providing a true reading and ensuring your creations bake evenly. I also like rotating the pan midway while baking, as it allows for an even distribution of heat.The next thing people mess up on is measuring and the specificity of ingredients in a recipe. Our moms made our food with their instinct; it is something that they learned along the way, but when you are baking, you cannot instinctively add or omit a few steps.I think that is why we initially had problems with baking. In a culture where cooking comes instinctually, baking challenges us, to be precise. A gram of more or less of any ingredient can drastically alter the outcome. Different methods of measuring flour can yield different results.Every component in baking serves a distinct purpose and function. Flour offers structure, sugar adds sweetness and moisture, eggs bind things together, and butter enhances taste and texture. However, not all ingredients are created equally. For example, using salted butter instead of unsalted might change the taste profile of your meal.Similarly, different flours have varying protein concentrations, which affect the texture of baked goods. The type of sugar used also makes a difference. Granulated sugar, brown sugar, powdered sugar, and speciality sugars like turbinado or muscovado each add unique flavours to a bake.Understanding these nuances and how they interact is critical for getting the intended outcomes. Accurate measurement tools and techniques are essential, but mastering them can be a steep learning curve. So, I would recommend investing in a kitchen scale that allows for more accurate measurements by weight rather than volume.Moving on, leavening agents such as baking soda, baking powder, and yeast are required to make baked goods rise. However, they can also cause confusion and errors. Baking soda needs an acidic component to activate, but baking powder has both an acid and a base, making it self-activating.Using the wrong type of flour or sugar, or using them in incorrect proportions, can result in flat, overly raised, or collapsed cakes. Yeast, being a living organism, presents its challenges.The water temperature must be just right—not too hot to kill the yeast, nor too cold to inhibit its activity. Proofing times and conditions also need to be carefully managed to achieve the perfect rise.Bakers should also be careful about the way they mix ingredients. The method of mixing ingredients can significantly impact the final product. Over-mixing can develop too much gluten in cakes and pastries, leading to tough textures.Under-mixing can leave pockets of unincorporated ingredients, resulting in uneven bakes. Techniques like folding, creaming, and whipping each serve specific purposes and must be executed with care.Finally, home bakers must understand the importance of timing and patience in baking. Even a minute or two can make the difference between perfectly baked cookies and burnt edges.Recipes often provide a range for baking times, but factors like oven hot spots, pan material, and altitude can affect these times. It’s crucial to keep a close eye on your bakes and rely on visual and tactile cues, such as a cake pulling away from the sides of the pan or a toothpick coming out clean, to determine doneness.Baking is also an exercise in patience, a virtue not everyone possesses. Doughs need time to rest and rise, flavours need time to meld, and baked goods need time to cool before they can be enjoyed.Impatience can lead to underbaked centres, crumbling slices, and a general sense of frustration. Cultivating patience is as important as mastering any technique in the baker’s repertoire.Home baking is a journey full of ups and downs, but it comes with great rewards. The obstacles encountered teach valuable lessons in patience, precision, and perseverance.The satisfaction of success, the freedom to create, and the therapeutic benefits make the endeavour meaningful. Whether baking for oneself, loved ones, or as an artistic outlet, the journey is as fulfilling as the result. Embrace the flour-dusted countertops, occasional setbacks, and the joys of home bakingFor a beginner-friendly recipe that involves mixing ingredients and delivers amazing results, try my recipe for fudgy, nutty brownies that I call ‘Bliss Brownies’.Bliss Brownies150g unsalted butter plus extra for the tin150g chopped dark chocolate200g caster sugar½ tsp baking powder2 eggs80g cocoa powder150g plain flour70g mixture of nuts (walnuts and almonds)60g blended papayaMix all the ingredients (except the dark chocolate and nuts) in a blender or a food processor and blitz till you get a smooth paste.Fold the chocolate and the nuts into the brownie batter, making sure that the pieces are evenly mixed in.Grease a loaf pan with soft butter and dust with cocoa powder. Pour the batter into the loaf pan.Bake in a preheated oven at 170c for 40 minutes and let it cool in the oven for an hour. Enjoy with a cup of coffee or, as I like it, a scoop of vanilla ice cream. \nIn a world where acceptance and safety often seem difficult to attain, many queer individuals also struggle to find a safe space to express themselves. They have to hide their true self and face relentless judgement when going to public places like cafes and restaurants.This is the reality for countless LGBTQIA+ individuals. The need for a safe space for this community is not just a desire but a necessity—a space where one can be themselves. This struggle for safety and acceptance can be traced to crucial historical moments, such as the Stonewall Riots of 1969 in New York City.The Stonewall Inn was more than a bar; it was a refuge for the queer community. When police raided the bar, the community fought back. This series of violent confrontations, which began in the early hours of June 28, 1969, between police and gay rights activists, marked the beginning of the modern LGBTQIA+ rights movement. The spirit of Stonewall, the fight for dignity and the right to exist openly lives on in places like Inclusive Galaxy Restaurant in Kathmandu. Inclusive Galaxy beyond a restaurant is an ‘oasis’ for the queer community and beyond.Founded by Bishwaraj Adhikari, Mr Gay Handsome Nepal 2013, a human rights defender, the restaurant proves the power of safe spaces. It’s a place where the community can unite, free from the prejudice and hostility that often permeate their everyday lives.After years of working in the human rights sector, Adhikari and his partner developed the idea for Inclusive Galaxy. What began as a small cafe gradually evolved into a full-fledged restaurant, driven by the growing demand and support from the community.“In developed countries with strong LGBTQIA+ movements, you can find community areas like gay villages. These are created as safe spaces for people whose families and communities have excluded them. They also support new business ideas and pink tourism. I hope to see pink tourism develop in Nepal someday,” says Adhikari. His vision for Inclusive Galaxy goes beyond just being a restaurant. He aims to promote financial independence and empowerment within the queer community.Since its inception in February 2019, Inclusive Galaxy has become a key spot for many in Lazimpat, a relatively queer-friendly area in Kathmandu. The location is essential because the first LGBTQIA+ movement in Nepal started in 2001 through the Blue Diamond Society.Inclusive Galaxy, true to its name, welcomes everyone—queer and non-queer alike—to share a comfortable space. His vision was clear: to create a space where people of all genders and sexual identities could come together without fear of exclusion.“I didn’t want to make it exclusively for queer people because that would be excluding ourselves from society. Different groups need to live together and understand each other,” Adhikari explains.In the early days, the cafe attracted both queer and non-queer customers. However, when some of the residents learned about Adhikari’s identity and the nature of the clientele, there was a brief period of hesitation. “At first, I didn’t understand what was happening, but then I realised my identity was an issue for a few people. I believe people should be judged by others by their character, not by their gender or sexuality. Over time, as residents saw that we operated like any other cafe, they became more comfortable,” Adhikari reflects.Adhikari started Inclusive Galaxy to give queer individuals a place to be proud of themselves, counteracting the self-doubt and insecurity that hiding one’s identity can cause. This turned the cafe very quickly into a community hub. The journey was not without challenges, though. It was difficult to hire staff and cooks from the LGBTQIA+ community, and soon after the restaurant opened, the COVID pandemic made things even harder.Despite these difficulties, the doors of Inclusive Galaxy remained open. During the pandemic, many queer individuals, who were abandoned by their families or afraid to return home, found comfort at Inclusive Galaxy.Since many couldn’t afford to pay for meals, the restaurant provided free food from its resources. As the number of people needing meals grew to 20-30 daily, Adhikari started raising funds within the community.“During my time as an activist, many people came here not only for food but also to see an organisation where the queer community supports one another,” Adhikari says.“The time during COVID was difficult, but it brought me closer to the community.”Four years after its inception, the restaurant has garnered a loyal following. Sarosy Neupane, Miss Pink Nepal 2024 first runner-up, describes Inclusive Galaxy as her second home. She moved to Kathmandu to study in 2022. Being distant from her family, she started visiting Galaxy for meals that reminded her of home-cooked food. Over time, she grew attached to the café because of its welcoming atmosphere.“It’s heartwarming to see people from our community and different walks of life here. The founders even invite us to festivals like ‘Dahi Chiura Khane din,’” she shares.Neupane visits the cafe regularly and sometimes stays until 3 am, engrossed in conversations. “I hope more spaces like this can open in the future. If, unfortunately, this place were to close someday, I don’t think we’d have any other place to turn to,” she adds.Muna Chhetri, a trans woman who has been a loyal customer for three years, shares, “This is my safe space where I can truly be myself. I always feel judged in other restaurants, but that fear doesn’t exist here. It’s where even those who aren’t accepted at home can feel accepted.”Sahara Khadka Chhetri, owner of Pink Tiffany, Kathmandu’s first openly LGBTIQIA+ friendly restaurant and bar, frequently visits after managing the bar, appreciating the convenience of not cooking at home.She notes very few places like this cater to our community, and some even had to close during COVID. “As an entrepreneur, I know that sustaining these spaces is a challenge. But as more spaces like these open, they will make the way for a more inclusive and compassionate society.”The welcoming atmosphere at Inclusive Galaxy has also had a surprising effect on non-queer patrons. Samriddha Jung Rana, a twenty-year-old neighbour who identifies as straight, often visits the café and appreciates the importance of such spaces.“Previously, I didn’t know much about the queer community and didn’t care much. But now, coming into this café, I’ve been interested in their rights and issues. I’ve realised that we’re not so different after all. We are all human,” he remarks.The ventures like Inclusive Galaxy and Pink Tiffany have inspired hope for collaborative businesses between queer and non-queer groups. The recent initiative by the Nepal Tourism Board promoting Pink Tourism in April 2024 is a positive step. Still, Adhikari believes that more support is needed from the government and the private sector.Despite the progress, challenges remain. However, Adhikari remains optimistic about the future. He is working on plans to develop the restaurant into a homestay program in the future.“Like how different planets, asteroids, and stars make up a beautiful galaxy, people from all walks of life and identities make a beautiful society. I am happy that we are assimilating together in this space. We are not so different; we are all different and similar simultaneously,” he says. \nOne morning on a fading Tuesday of our vacation, I couldn't shake off the worry that my hard-earned savings from tutoring were slipping away faster than I’d planned. Out of nowhere, I messaged my friend Santona on a whim: ‘A trip to Rara’. With little hope, I awaited her reply, and I have no idea what I’d have done if she had denied it. However, just like the phrase “waiting for the nudge,” she enthusiastically agreed, and soon we roped in our friend, Nirjara.This wasn’t our first trip together—we’d ventured to Pokhara, tried bungee jumping, paragliding, and trekked trails like Khuma and Korchan since our first year of bachelor studies. My idea this time was a well-packaged tour, but plans changed, and new destinations were chosen. The pristine Tilicho Lake became our goal. Without overthinking, I agreed; after all, it’s Nepal and here, no matter where you decide to trek, you’ll experience heaven.From Kathmandu to Manang: Green Lake and apple delightsTravelling to Manang was a meditative experience in itself. As a scout exploring different parts of Nepal, I had often embraced the rush of adventure. But here, by the serene Green Lake under the sun's warm glow, I felt a genuine sense of accomplishment: ‘We’ve finally made it—without getting lost and in the right place.’ We clicked photos, laughed, and even made some silly TikTok videos. The famous apple farms of Manang called out to us with their irresistible offer: a feast of apples for just Rs200. If you’re travelling here, catching the early bus ensures Manang’s charm unfolds entirely by the end of the day.Khangsar to Tilicho Base Camp: rocks and rantsAn early morning jeep ride brought us to Khangsar. The trek was said to take 5-6 hours, but once we started, I moved ahead of my friends, a habit I don’t quite understand. I wondered if my friends would make it before dark. To my relief, their laughter and chatter soon filled the air, joining me.Then we set off into the landslide area, with jagged rocks above hanging like wind chimes ready to fall. We promised not to look up and remained focused on the trail. The journey was filled with everyday conversations from patriarchy to childhood TV shows, and before we knew it, the night wrapped around us as we arrived at the base camp. After some confusion over our booking, we finally settled in, ate quickly, and fell asleep. One tip: keep an eye on your things at Shrikharka—I lost my trekking poles there.Tilicho Lake: A view, a void, and acceptance Morning arrived. We emptied our room and set out, uncertain if we’d return in time and head straight to Shrikharka or stay the night again at base camp. One friend battled altitude sickness but pushed on fiercely, even bargaining for a horse ride, only to find me eventually outpacing it.As I neared the lake, the solitude and distance overwhelmed me. I called my father, who offered only a few comforting words before the line dropped. Thankfully, friends from home Nuya and Shri reached out, and I poured my thoughts to them through tears. With renewed spirit, I moved forward and finally reached a quiet pond that tricked me into thinking I’d arrived. Only after some guidance did I stand before the actual Tilicho Lake.Strangely, I felt no rush of joy. The sight was majestic, yet my reaction fell flat. I asked myself if it was okay to feel so indifferent. However, I accepted that sometimes it’s okay to feel nothing at all. A simple “I don’t know” was all the answers I needed.We had no rooms left on our last night at base camp, so we slept in a dorm, which was a cheaper and warmer option. After dinner, my friends drifted off, but I lingered by the fire, unwilling to leave its comfort. The dining hall was full of trekkers glued to their seats even after finishing their food until a friendly trek guide offered us seats. These guides, cheerful and chatty, shared fun stories and gossip.Ultimately, I want to say to all who recently went trekking, whether funded by parents or your hard-earned savings, to be proud and grateful for the opportunity to explore. And for those who couldn’t go this time, trust that your moment will come. Keep moving forward with hope, knowing that one day, your adventure awaits. \nThe noise of ever-growing traffic, the breaking and mending of black-topped roads, and an ever-expanding concrete jungle are some features that one would associate with the Kathmandu Valley.It is a wildly growing urban forest quickly transforming into a busy metropolis where every inch of space is ready to be sold and built. Yet, pockets of the past remain—small, peaceful neighbourhoods where houses are still made of wood, paths are made of stone tiles, and the stillness of a world that wants to stay intact and immobile. These places are known for tourism, culture, and the restoration of community pride. One such stop is the quiet village of Khokana in southern Lalitpur.Khokana is comparatively close to the mainland urban Lalitpur; from the ring road junction of Bagdole, it takes only a 10-minute drive to reach there. From the airport, you can take a cab directly to Khokana, which will take around half an hour. Get your cameras and hiking boots ready; the area is filled with historical artefacts and hiking trails.However, it is vastly different from the city. It is much nearer to the hills, where stone-paved paths, which could easily be goat trails, are rare in today’s Kathmandu.One such goat trail leads to Sikali temple, a major attraction of the area and accessible only on foot. The pavements are lined with big and small temples on each side, along with ponds that serve as clean water sources and a location for religious rituals. The houses are made of bricks and wood. The concrete invasion, although present, is minimal. Scattered every few hundred metres are small mustard oil mills, co-operative businesses of the locals of Khokana that have existed since medieval times.A site well-recognised for its historical significance, Khokana was even proposed to be made a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1996. Sikali TempleAround an hour’s walk from the historic town, Sikali Temple can be reached, which is also the location for its famed Sikali Jatra.While it can be reached through any public vehicle, a more holistic and adventurous route is to follow the goat trails on the outskirts of Khokana. This route, albeit long, allows for great hiking opportunities, scenic views of the hills surrounding the Kathmandu Valley, and a close-up view of the mediaeval but well-maintained architecture of the local houses.Even if you lose the way, which is very possible, the locals are very welcoming and more than willing to guide you. The main temple itself is three stories tall, and built in the Pagoda style, a common style in many temples in the valley.It is surrounded by a lush grass field which plays the stage to the Sikali Jatra held every year. The temple, like many religious spots around Khokana, is dedicated to the local deity Shree Rudrayani.The Sikali Jatra, a five-day festival that serves as an alternative to Dashain for the Khokana locals, is filled with chariot dances, battle enactments, and storytelling celebrations in the worship of Goddess Rudrayani.Starting from Ghatasthapana in mid to late September, the Jatra is vibrant and an essential experience for every visitor. Historical Khokana townKhokana’s historical town is located around 5 minutes walking distance from the local bus park. The town complex, paved with hand-made stone tiles, is graced with the Indrayanee temple but also has many red-bricked houses built in the local Newari architecture, some of them centuries old.One such house is the ‘Khokana Museum’. Although closed, it is widely popular for being the first house to be lit with electricity in Nepal, as Chandra Shamsher did in 1911.The stand-holder of the first light bulb can still be seen, serving as a historical monument for everyone to see.Similarly, the town complex is also filled with Guthi houses, small ponds, and even the local Ward office. While the Ward office provides a wealth of information for visitors interested in the area’s history, the Guthi halls symbolise the strong community support culture of the locals.The ponds, a notable one present right opposite the Indrayanee temple, have stone taps and remind us of primitive ways of obtaining clean water—a practice many locals are still engaged in.Yet, these ponds are also religious locations, especially used in rituals in the Sikali Jatra.Finally, a stroll through the complex allows visitors to explore old houses and historical artefacts in the serene quietness of Khokana, while the small outlets and Choila places nearby allow you to enjoy the spicy duck or chicken delicacies at the same time.Overall, the historical complex is enough to transport visitors back to a glimpse of the medieval past of the Kathmandu Valley. Mustard oil millsThe most well-known feature of Khokana is its mustard oil mills, which have been operational for hundreds of years and have been using the same methods of preparation since their inception.These mills, scattered throughout Khokana, are often community-owned, and even the ones owned by certain individuals have almost exclusively employed locals.Despite the advent of modern machinery, there is still substantial demand for their products due to the assured guarantee.When I visited one such mill, the local staff informed me that the furnace and oil presser used by them were 300 years old, given by the Patan royalty even before the Shahs became king.In addition to buying pure, organically created mustard oil and pellets, visiting these oil mills offers many educational benefits for international and local tourists alike.Khokana offers visitors a unique glimpse into a preserved bubble of the past through its tranquillity, preservation of ancient lifestyle and cultural elements, and remarkable self-sustenance.  \n“How much oxygen do you have for the summit?”I think this is the kind of question a film producer would ask. But when you're on the mountain, the answer is never clear.I have worked for a long time in the film industry and different art areas, especially photography and engraving.Working in various fields and drawing inspiration from them has become a new normal for me. I have made this approach my way of life without even realising it.I took responsibility for producing the last movie I worked on and shot the behind-the-scenes footage for a documentary. By doing so, I witnessed the entire shooting process and the journey of a movie.In the snowy highlands of Turkey, we had to endure the consequences of the changing climate to shoot ‘About Dry Grasses’, directed by Nuri Bilge Ceylan. The highlands used to be snowy in January, but by the time we got there in the same month, there was no snow. Nature was changing. It was responding to what was happening—to what humanity had done to it. In the end, it snowed, and we shot the intense snow scenes we wanted. But since most of our days were sunny, unlike what the director wanted, we had to shoot in the sunset and sunrise hours. As crew members, we spent many days waiting for the sun to set.Production requires creating opportunities, finding solutions, and being creative for a work of art to come true. For this, patience, endurance, calmness, and timing are necessary. On the other hand, nature wanted us to listen to it and wait for the right time.During that time, I witnessed many of nature's lessons. For example, I experienced extreme cold for the first time. We endured temperatures ranging from -33 degrees to +55 degrees. By listening to nature, surrendering to its forces, and working within its limits, we managed to persevere.No matter how much you prepare or plan during the pre-production phase, if you are working in nature, remember that nature will always have the final say.The film was completed, released, and connected with audiences. Its success at Cannes 2023 was followed by my trip to the North Pole for my project. I returned with a mix of wonderful developments, joys, and challenges. During this process, I experienced life and death, happiness and sadness, losses and awards.I realised the value of being able to breathe comfortably a few days after my father's chemotherapy ended. Just a few days earlier, he had said, \"Well done, my daughter. I'm glad you went!\" All the anxiety and hard work, filled with fears at the beginning, were finally behind me.Before going to Everest, when I was on the verge of giving up, defeated by my fears, I remembered my father's words. Everest reminded me of what he said while struggling to breathe, adding a turning point to my life.What does it mean to say ‘life’s turning point?’ How many turning points can there be in life?Who am I, and what am I doing in this world? How well do I know my own limits? Can I find answers to these big questions? These thoughts sparked my dream of journeying to Everest. Now, after returning, I can say that it turned my life around.“How much oxygen do you need for the summit?” sounds more like “How much do you need to hold on to life?” How many reasons do you find that give meaning to your life, keep you alive, and allow you to breathe? How much can you endure in the face of obstacles, and can you keep believing that a solution will eventually come your way?Can these questions be separated from the idea of measuring and assessing something, from learning its quantity and financial value? Can everything be known with certainty? Should the journey be fully understood in advance, with all its promises laid out? Should it be viewed like a purchase with a price tag, asking, “Is this journey worth this much?”I had never trekked before and had no climbing experience. I had lived at sea level my entire life and had never been to a high altitude.However, this journey was not only about the physical climb but also an inner discovery. After losing my father to lung cancer, his breathing difficulties taught me the fragility of breath, life, and existence. I also mentally prepared myself for the physical challenges I might face. Despite all my concerns, could this journey help me understand the cycle of life and the resilience of the soul?So, how could I make this trek possible? How could I land in Nepal? Despite all the economic difficulties and the many things I felt needed organising, I did my best and believed in it.Since I was embarking on this journey, I felt I should share about my travels and inspire others.Starting with photography, cinema, and engraving, which are already integral parts of my life, I dreamed of documenting and sharing the inspiring aspects of this journey.After months of correspondence and dreaming, it all came true. Finally, I embarked on the journey with the goal of creating photographs, engravings, and documentaries. I learned a great deal from my travels in Nepal, from the people I met, and from every moments I witnessed. I felt incredibly fortunate to have been able to honour my father’s memory with the peace and serenity I experienced in the Himalayas.During my 15-day journey to Everest Base Camp, I encountered nature’s masterpieces at every turn. As concerns like “How will I endure?” and “How will I finish?” started to weigh on me, the mountains suddenly parted with the clouds and gazed down at me.It was amazing to witness the appearance of ‘Gods’ that I had never seen before, in such immense size and in such a close, awe-inspiring manner beside me during that silent walk.As someone who came from one of the most crowded cities in the world, Istanbul, while I struggled with my daily questions and uncertainties, trying to control everything, they stood there calmly, as if answering me.They were just there—before and after.My guide, Lakhpa Sherpa, always reminded me not to worry about how high we were, how long it would take to reach our accommodation, or what the weather would be like. He encouraged me to live in the moment, and he was right.He advised me to focus on my breathing, not to get thirsty, to eat enough, and to appreciate the extraordinary beauty of the journey. In the mountains, plans dissolve and each moment is embraced as it comes.All the good wishes, prayers, and everything encountered along the way were for the journey itself. The mountain was full of life, secrets, and everything I had wondered about.This 15-day journey to Everest Base Camp was a solo adventure, yet I wouldn't have been able to complete it without my guide, Lhakpa, and my porter. Additionally, I was fortunate enough to experience the hospitality, generosity, and honesty at Trekkers Paradise, which organised the entire journey and provided guidance.I witnessed how dedication and sincerity are crucial in completing a journey safely and healthily. Ghanshyam Sharma, from Trekkers Paradise and Sauraj Jhingan, a climber who summited the Everest in 2018, shared their experiences with me during the journey.They experienced the 2015 earthquake while they were at the Everest Base Camp.As a filmmaker, their role as actors, and attention to detail played a significant role in bringing my dream photography and documentary project to life.The sponsors of my journey were Turkish Airlines, The North Face, Apple, Canon, and Stanley. My supporters include Oscar International College and Nepal Film Campus. Throughout the journey, I shared many experiences, memories, and countless photos and images with my students.On my way back home after 21 days, I celebrated my birthday on the plane. From the right window, the Himalayas bid me farewell. I felt like I had opened a new chapter in my life, and I was certain that I would return.I had made many friends and memories in Nepal.For now, I will be working on a documentary and preparing for a photography and engraving exhibition titled ‘My Soul Beyond the Mountain’.To the Himalayas: This summer was spent with you, but we will meet again soon. \nWe spent five days in Sri Lanka two weeks ago, driving up and down the island, covering almost 70 percent of its territory. Our tour spanned over 1,000 kilometres, including hills, beach spots, and heritage and religious sites.Our first stop in Sri Lanka was Colombo’s Bandaranaike International Airport. We were greeted by a warm and humid breeze when we exited the airport. The host briefed us (a group of journalists) that heavy rainfall has affected areas across Sri Lanka since mid-May 2024. Rain and storms intensified on June 1, with the most significant effects in the south and west of the country. We were lucky to have no rain in the forecast.On the first night, we checked into the lavish Jetwing Lake resort, an opulent sanctuary amidst the lush landscape. The resort’s expansive grounds were a retreat, offering a glimpse of Sri Lanka's natural beauty. We feasted on delicious cuisine, every bite exploding with flavour, introducing us to the island’s famed culinary delights. On June 7, early morning, the sun shone brightly, previewing the promise of an incredible journey ahead. We set off early the following day, eager to explore the mysteries of this enchanting island. As we ventured further into the heart of Sri Lanka, the landscape revealed its majestic nature. We were astounded by seeing Pidurangala Rock, a 200-metre-high granite colossus just a kilometre north of Sigiriya. The short hike to Pidurangala Rock offered breathtaking views of Sigiriya and beyond. We climbed the steep steps and soon were rewarded with a breathtaking panoramic view of the surrounding landscape. It took us 30 minutes to climb. The sight took our breaths away and left us humbled in the presence of such grandeur. From the top are glorious vistas of the surrounding landscape and an incredible view of the majestic Sigiriya Rock. From there, Sigiriya Lion’s Rock is visible, standing alone. This was the place where demon king Ravana had his palace in the Treta Yuga. Believed to have been built 50 centuries ago, the palace is said to have had a unique lift for Ravana and his visitors. Ravana imprisoned Sita in one of the caves at the bottom of this humongous boulder. Sigiriya is a fifth-century fortress in Sri Lanka carved out of an inselberg, a hill of hard volcanic rock that soared high above the surrounding jungle. We spent two hours atop the rock, mainly taking photographs. We descended from Pidurangala Rock, filled with awe and a sense of accomplishment.The journey ahead seemed even more enticing as we ventured along the winding roads, heading towards our next destination.Cash-strapped Sri Lanka plunged into its worst financial crisis in more than seven decades in 2022, with a severe dollar shortage sending inflation soaring to a high of 70 percent, its currency to record lows, and its economy contracting 7.3 percent.Thanks to the growing number of tourists, Sri Lanka is now bouncing back.In Jetwing Lake, we met Kasun Pradeep Somasiri, a receptionist. He briefed us that the resort is now 50 percent occupied. “That’s a better figure now as we are recovering.”The travel and tourism sector is a significant income generator for Sri Lanka. However, the economic crisis, the Ukraine–Russia war, and China’s zero-Covid policy have jeopardised the industry.Tourism accounted for more than 12 percent of the country’s GDP in 2019 and was the third-largest source of foreign exchange reserves, behind worker remittances and the apparel industry.Sri Lanka was poised to be one of the world’s best holiday destinations due to its rich culture, wealth of natural resources, and diversity of accessible experiences.However, tourism-dependent Sri Lanka suffered its first major setback with the Easter bombings 2019. This led to the collapse of inbound tourism flows as international arrivals declined by 18 percent year-on-year, and tourist expenditure fell by 17.7 percent that year. This was immediately followed by two years of pandemic restrictions. Inbound visitors fell to just 116,600 in 2021.An acute balance of payments crisis forced Sri Lanka to preemptively default on foreign debt of over $50 billion in April 2022, triggering a crippling economic contraction with spiralling inflation.“Tourism is gaining momentum,” says Somasiri. “The British and Chinese have started to return to Sri Lanka.”January-August is the peak season for foreigners. “From December to April, local people travel for holiday purposes,” says Somasiri. Before we started the tour to other religious sites, our tour guide, Sampath Mayadunne, told us, “Don't take selfies with your back to Buddha.” Turning your back on a Buddha statue and some other religious sites to take photos and videos is a strict no-no.The most common sight across Sri Lanka is the tank cascades system, an ancient irrigation infrastructure. The system is a network of small tanks draining to large reservoirs that store rainwater and surface runoff for later use.“These infrastructures were built by its ancient kings over 2,000 years ago to solve the water scarcity in the country’s dry zone,” says Mayadunne.On day two, we travelled to Ranweli Spice Garden in Matale. This garden is famous for its rare spices and herbs. A tour of the gardens will show you the cultivation, harvesting, cleaning, and packaging process, as well as the health benefits and uses of the herbs.On the way, we saw a colourful Muthumariamman Hindu temple, boasting hundreds of detailed sculptures in a rich mosaic of colour.In Kandy, we visited the Temple of the Tooth Relic (Sri Dalada Maligawa), one of the most sacred places of worship in the Buddhist world. It was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1988.The temple sustained damage from bombings by Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna in 1989 and by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam in 1998. However, it was fully restored each time.We then headed to Jetwing St Andrew’s, a luxurious 5-star property in Sri Lanka’s hill country of Nuwara Eliya, situated at 1,900 metres above sea level. During our stay in Kandy, we immersed ourselves in the city's charm and the serenity of the countryside. On the third day, early morning, we travelled to Nuwara Eliya, the area famous for tea estates that give many Nepalis the feeling that they have come to Kanyam, Ilam, in eastern Nepal.We visited a tea factory called Damro Labookellie Tea Centre, the oldest tea centre in Sri Lanka. Due to its cold climate, it is the most important area for tea production in Sri Lanka.In this tea factory, they make white and black tea, while the green tea is processed in another tea factory and then sent to Damro.After the tea factory tour and the tea tasting, we headed to Galle, our next resting point.We encountered narrow, winding, and maze-like streets and alleys in Nuwara Eliya, known as ‘Little England’. The town has preserved almost all its British-era buildings and is calm and beautiful. On our way to Galle, at the roadside, our tour guide stopped us at the famed Sita temple, which has Hanuman's footprints and is the place where Sita, wife of Lord Rama, was held captive by the demon king Ravana after he abducted her from India.We were at Sita Eliya, a temple named Sri Seethai Amman.When we reached the Hindu temple, rich in vibrant colours and architectural elements, it was full of devotees. The water stream adjoining the temple is believed to be where Sita bathed. Large footprints are found on the stones in the stream, and there is a saying that those belong to Hanuman, who came spying to find Sita’s whereabouts.In Ella, Ravana’s waterfalls are significant in the Rama-Ravana story. The cascade charms visitors from all over the globe. The waterfall is easily accessible and is known to have hidden caves at the top, which are believed to have been used as Ravana's residence.The 25-metre-tall waterfall is a beautiful cascade that provides the perfect backdrop for a photo to remember your Ramayana trail adventures in Sri Lanka. A short pilgrimage tour ended there, and it was now time for an adventure. Though it was not part of our itinerary, our guide decided to tour us on a train ride.Though short, only six kilometres from Ella to Demodera, it was thrilling. Everyone screamed in unison like kids on a fair ride to hear the echoes in the dark every time we passed through the tunnels. The sound of the train is subtly different inside a tunnel. For the first-timer, the darkness and shouts inside the tunnels when the train passes would be scary, like a horror movie.The train we boarded wasn’t crowded, but people had already filled the doorway, ready for the scenic journey.With the shrill sound of a whistle, the train slowly pulled away from the platform at Ella, passing houses, coconut trees and green fields.As the train progressed, tourists and locals were leaning out the windows and crowding to hang out the doors. I joined the crowd and hung out on a train. A short excitement ended there.After lunch, we headed to Galle and reached Jetwing Lighthouse. As soon as our group entered the hotel, they shouted with excitement.The hotel is on a rocky outcrop three miles west of Galle. Waves crash over giant boulders in front of it and produce howling winds.We were at Galle’s 17th-century fort five minutes from the hotel on day four. In the Bay of Galle on the southwest coast of Sri Lanka, Galle Fort was built first in 1588 by the Portuguese and lavishly rebuilt by the Dutch during the 17th century. It is a historical, archaeological and architectural heritage monument that maintains a perfect appearance even after more than 436 years.We then reached Hikkaduwa Beach, a popular beach destination on the southern coast of Sri Lanka. On the way, we saw a 30-metre-high Big Buddha Statue. It is a replica of the 6th-century Buddhas of Bamiyan destroyed by the Taliban in Afghanistan. It was created using the earliest known sketches of the statue. It was built in remembrance of the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami victims.We then travelled through the 222-kilometre-long Southern Expressway, Sri Lanka's first expressway linking the capital, Colombo, with Galle, Matara, and Hambantota, significant cities south of the island.On day five, we reached Colombo, the capital of Sri Lanka. Jetwing Colombo Seven hosted us in the bustling capital. We took a city tour early morning and visited Bally's Casino at night.On day six, we returned to Kathmandu early in the morning on a Sri Lankan Airlines flight, the airline that organised the trip in coordination with Jetwing Hotels Limited, a Sri Lankan hotel chain.National flag carrier Nepal Airlines, in its previous avatar as Royal Nepal Airlines, used to operate direct flights to Colombo during the 1980s. However, the carrier suspended operations following an armed movement by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) in Sri Lanka. There had been no direct air links between the two countries for decades.In 2016, Himalaya Airlines started a chartered flight that lasted a few months due to low traffic movement between the two countries. Sri Lankan Airlines started operating direct flights to Kathmandu in August 2021.“The main objective of this media tour is to increase tourism in both countries for mutual benefit. We want to draw Nepalis for pilgrims and leisure activities,” says Nilina Pathirana, Country Manager at Srilankan Airlines in Nepal.“We have understood that Nepali travellers tend to travel to Bangkok, Vietnam, Malaysia, Dubai, and Maldives. Nepalis have quite minimal knowledge about Sri Lanka and the religious connection between Lanka and Nepal. We want to promote Nepal and Sri Lanka jointly. This will be a win-win business,” added Pathirana.The airline said it currently carries 60 percent of the passengers from Nepal to Sri Lanka and beyond destinations like Tokyo, Sydney, Melbourne, and other Middle Eastern destinations. The return airfare for a 3.5-hour-long flight starts at Rs74,000. “We have a four-night, five-day package that begins from Rs80,000, depending on the properties and extended itineraries,” says Pathirana.Nepalis must submit certain required documents for visa processing, like their passport copy and bank statement. Due to this government-to-government policy, only Nepalis must obtain a prior visa. Otherwise, Sri Lankans are required to have a visa upon arrival.“The other best thing is that Sri Lankan Airlines can be involved with the visa process or facilitate the Nepalis tourists. Our main intention is to have a sustainable market in Kathmandu and make it a daily flight,” says Pathirana. \nMundhum Trek in Koshi province in the eastern part of Nepal is a new cultural walking trail. It passes through several indigenous ethnic villages and landscapes in Khotang and Bhojpur districts. This trail goes up to an elevation of 4,200 metres to the viewpoint of Silchung Peak and takes one through the settlements of the Kirati people. This route starts from Diktel Bazaar and passes through beautiful settlements like Chakhewa, Rawa Dhap, Salpa Bhanjyang, Silchung and Hanspokhari before ending in Bhojpur. There are some hotels in Diktel but trekkers are advised to carry tents. The trail offers panoramic views of most of the eight-thousanders, including Everest, Lhotse, Makalu, Cho Oyu and Kanchenjunga mountains. The spring season, March through May, is highly recommended for the trek.Janaki Mandir Janaki Mandir at Janakpur in Madhesh province was constructed in 1874 and is a blend of Mughal and local architecture. The temple is a three-storey building and has 60 rooms, making it the largest temple in Nepal. Pilgrims flock here by the thousands to pay homage to Janaki Mandir—Janaki being the other name of Sita, the daughter of King Janak. The temple houses an idol of Sita which was found near Ayodhya, the kingdom of Ram. The marriage anniversary of Lord Ram and Sita is celebrated in Janakpur every year on Vivaha Panchami, which falls in December. In the southwest corner of Janaki Mandir is the Vivaha Mandap, which has been built at the site where the marriage of Ram and Sita is said to have taken place. Another well-known temple in the vicinity is Ram Mandir, which is built in pagoda style and is hence different from the other temples in Janakpur that generally bear resemblance to Mughal architecture. It houses a female statue, said to be of Yogamaya, which has the reputation of being one of the most beautiful images of female forms in Nepal. Other holy sites of interest include the Laxman Temple, Sankat Mochan Temple and Hanuman Temple.Kuri Village, Kalinchok Kuri village, a popular tourist destination around 150 km from Kathmandu, lies at an altitude of 3,842 metres above sea level in Kalinchowk of Dolakha district, in Bagmati province. People visit the place to enjoy the snow during the winter besides the mesmerising landscapes and splendid panoramic view of the Himalayan range. Kalinchok gets snow mainly at the end of December and the snowfall continues till the end of February or mid-March. When there is snow, it is difficult for jeeps, buses and cars to reach the top of Kuri village. Chains are wrapped around the wheels of vehicles and specially modified jeeps with highly experienced drivers are used to carry visitors. There are several hotels and restaurants in the area. The road up to Kuri has also improved over the years.Annapurna Base Camp Annapurna Base Camp trek, in Gandaki province, makes for a picturesque journey that takes you to the foothills of the Annapurna South, up to 4,130 metres above sea level. The five-day trek (seven days for slow walkers) offers rich cultural diversities, typical Nepali villages and the flora and fauna nestled at the foothills of Annapurna. The distance from Pokhara to Annapurna Base Camp is approximately 81 kilometres. It is among the shortest and most budget-friendly treks in Nepal. For Nepalis, lodging costs around $5 to $10 per day. For foreigners, the overall cost of the trek ranges from $800 to $1500 on average per person. Annapurna Base Camp trek can be done at any time throughout the year as each season offers a different trekking experience. The ideal time for the trek depends on your weather preferences and what you expect from it. However, autumn (September to October) and spring (March to May) are considered the two best seasons for the trek, as the days at the time are warm and bright with clear skies.Bardiya National Park Bardiya National Park, located in the southern Tarai belt of Lumbini province, is home to one of the most elusive and majestic animals on earth—the Royal Bengal Tiger. The park, which covers an area of 968 square kilometres, is considered one of the most important protected areas in the country. It is a prime destination for those looking to catch a glimpse of a tiger. A bit of luck and patience will offer a good chance to see the Bengal Tiger. The jungle safari also offers one the opportunity to spot Asian elephants and the greater one-horned rhinoceros. The rare Gangetic river dolphins are occasionally spotted on rafting trips along the Geruwa River, the eastern channel of the Karnali river. Besides, visitors can enjoy the homestays and explore local Tharu culture. The right time to visit the park is from mid-September to mid-December and mid-February to May.Khaptad National Park Khaptad National Park in Sudurpaschim province is a protected area in the far western region. It stretches over four districts of Bajhang, Bajura, Achham and Doti and ranges in elevation from 1,400 to 3,300 metres. The park can be visited throughout the year. Trekkers are advised to bring their tents, food and other supplies. The Nepal Tourism Board says of late, social media has been increasingly influencing Nepali travellers to go to Khaptad. Since the far-flung Khaptad National Park is still offbeat for many travellers, the area remains pristine and fresh. The seasons of spring (March-May) and autumn (October-November) are the ideal times to visit the park. The temperature ranges from 10°c to 20°c offering pleasant trekking weather. The monsoon begins in June and lasts until September and during this time, roads often become muddy and slippery. From December to February, winter brings snow and chilling winds to the park.Limi Valley \nNepal have been eliminated from the Women’s ACC U-19 Cup after suffering a nine-wicket defeat to Bangladesh in the Super-4 stage on Friday. The loss dashed Nepal's hopes of reaching the final.Bangladesh comfortably chased Nepal’s modest target of 55 runs in the slated 11 overs, achieving it in just 9.5 overs while losing only one wicket. Fahomida Choya led Bangladesh’s charge with an unbeaten 26 runs, supported by Mosammat Eva (18 runs) and Sumaiya Akhter Suborna (10 runs). Kusum Godar was the sole wicket-taker for Nepal.The match, played at the Bayuemas Oval in Malaysia, was reduced to 11 overs per side due to rain. Nepal, batting first after losing the toss, managed to score only 54 runs for the loss of eight wickets in their allotted overs.Nepal’s opener, Sabitri Dhami, was the top scorer with 11 runs, while captain Puja Mahato and Elisha Yadav contributed nine and eight runs, respectively.With this victory, Bangladesh secured a spot in the final, finishing the Super-4 stage with six points. India, with seven points, advanced to the final.Nepal had earlier made headlines in the group stage with a historic win against Pakistan, securing their place in the Super-4. However, their journey ended with the defeat to Bangladesh, highlighting the challenges of competing at the top level. \nChaaaiiittt…The spontaneous eruption of the sound of victory thundered through the neighbourhood of Nhyokha in the Kathmandu core. The line of a kite cut another. Looking out the window of her house, Sajani Shrestha saw children running full speed, shouting and fighting as they vied to catch the falling kite and thread. And craning her neck up to the sky, she could not count but only be mesmerised by the innumerable kites strewn across the skies of Nhyokha, Bangemudha, Indrachowk. “There would be so many kites that they entirely covered the blue of the sky, making beautiful patterns of different colours,” says the 51-year-old. “And you cannot imagine the number of times the call of chait rang in the air.”Clear blue sky and gentle westerlies, the season of kites has arrived in the Kathmandu Valley. While kites soared Kathmandu's sky mainly during Dashain, the kite season officially started in Nag Panchami (August) and ended on the Haribodhini Ekadashi (November). And from royalities to commoners, young and old all flew kites from rooftops and open grounds. Even those who did not, like Sajani, revelled in the live spectacle in the sky as kites soared and fought. With Bhimsen Thapa’s help, King Girvanyuddha flies kites The earliest written account of kite flying is believed to date to 200 BC in China. In Kathmandu, this tradition has religious and socio-cultural and environmental significance, says Tina Manandhar, lecturer of Nepalese History, Culture and Archaeology at Tribhuvan University. According to her, it is believed that kites in Kathmandu skies carry a message to the god of rain Indra that the valley's farmers have had enough rain for their crops. That is why Kathmandu farmers scolded anyone flying kites before plantation season.In an article ‘Changako Utpati Ra Bikas’ published in Gorkhapatra in 1995, historian Rajesh Gautam points to the lack of written documents indicating the exact time when kite culture was introduced in Nepal. Exploring different opinions on kite's introduction to Nepal, he writes that “some have opined the possibility that the skill and tradition of kite flying might have entered Nepal through India.” Yet some others, he writes, state that kites “came to Nepal from Japan during the time of [Rana PM] Dev Shumsher.”He concludes that most likely this tradition was introduced by Malla-era Newar traders: “But since Nepal’s relationship with Tibet and China is very old and direct, kites might have entered Nepal through the Newar traders who were engaged in the trade. One can estimate that the kite was introduced to Nepal during the (mediaeval) Malla regime.”In Social History of Nepal, TR Vaidya, Tri Ratna Manandhar and Shankar Lal Joshi write that there exists documented evidence of the kite flying from the early 19th century. The authors state that Sundarananda, a contemporary poet, has mentioned that the young king Girvanyuddha Bikram Shah (r.1799-1816), with the help of Prime Minister Bhimsen Thapa, flew kites from the towering temple of Taleju Bhawani, Hanumandhoka. And when the king's kite cut the kites of the youngsters, they were located and rewarded with money.In Tyas Bakhatko Nepal, Sardar Bhim Bahadur Pandey states that “During the month of Kartik [October-November] young and old all flew kites,” suggesting that kite culture was ubiquitous in Kathmandu by the early twentieth century.Anticipations and preparationsKite flying in Nepal requires a kite, a lattai (a wooden spool), thread and majha (homemade adhesive prepared by boiling snail slime, rice or sago, and powdered glass from burnt electric bulbs and coated on the line to sharpen it for kite fighting).77-year-old Nirmal Man Tuladhar, an avid kite flyer and retired professor of Linguistics at the Tribhuvan University, explains how Nepali tradition of kite flying was both expensive and needing advance preparation.“In our times, it wasn’t easy to fly kites,” he says. “We had to prepare majha …And as Nepali kites are fighter kites, we mainly fought with other kites [which meant we spent a lot of threads].”This preparation needed first and foremost of passing a hurdle: securing finances and materials to fly kites. While lattai was a one-time investment that could be saved for years, kites and threads had to be replenished every time a kite was cut.“Those were the times when parents wanted us to be more focused in our studies. They only gave money [to buy kites] after immense pestering,” says 80-year-old Dwarika Nath Dhungel, former Secretary of Nepal government, speaking of the 1950s and 1960s.Biodiversity specialist and botanist Tirtha Bahadur Shrestha, 86, was born in Mahabouddha and began flying kites from 1951-52. He saved what little money he got for afternoon snacks to buy Hattimar reel, a brand of line wound in a small lattai, which was strong and sharp and where majha stuck well.Raghuji Pant, a member of parliament, also recalls the difficulty in securing money to sustain his kite flying in and around Kathmandu core in the 1960s and early 1970s. “Four to five of my kites were cut in a day,” writes the 67-year-old in his 2019 article “Changa Jastai Udi Hidne Man” published in Himalkhabar. “[This caused] the line in the spool to shorten. From Bhadra [August-September] to one to one and a half months after Dashain I spent flying kites. So, it was difficult for me to have enough kites even after getting money from grandfather, grandmother, mother and everyone.”Kites and thread secured, now began the crucial work of preparing and applying majha whose strength determined how well it cut other kites. Govinda Tandon, 70, a historian and heritage expert, who grew up in Battisputali, was also an ardent kite flyer.“Materials for making majha were prepared right from the morning on a holiday,\" he writes in his article “Dashainko Butte Changa” published in Gorkhapatra. “Because this work couldn’t be accomplished without a collaboration of 3-4 friends, a holiday was set aside for this. Moreover, a sunny day was considered appropriate. If the majha didn’t dry, the thread could turn moist, and so if it felt like the day wouldn’t be sunny, the entire plan…was aborted.”Kite makers, kite sellers and variety of kites One of the oldest shops in Kathmandu's memory, Shree Chitrakar Kite Center in Tyauda, Asan is bustling with customers during Dashain. “When my grandmother got married and came to this house at age 12 [in early 1940s], this shop was already here,” says its fourth generation owner 47-year-old Dinoj Chitrakar. “So the shop must be around a hundred years old.”Another shop that stands out in Kathmandu's memory is Manandhar Kite Center in Kalimati, established in 1949, and currently run by brothers Mohan Man and Sundar Man Manandhar.In his book Antar Taranga, artist and writer Manuj Babu Mishra recalls “a kite shop near the old halwai shop of Chabahil” in the 1940s. Dhungel and his 1960 batchmates of Juddhodaya Public School recall the kite shops from the 1950s and 1960s – Bekhacha’s Shop at Netapacho, Bhaicha’s Shop at Nhyokha, Lata Manandhar’s Shop at Maru, Kanchha Buddha Bajracharya Shop at Tyauda.Besides the shops, there were makers and sellers of kites cloistered in different localities of Kathmandu Valley.In Kwalkhu, Patan was a Joshi who made Nepali paper kites.“One day I accompanied my uncle to buy kites,\" writes Dibya Giri, 69, in his 2023 article “Changa” in Sahitya Post. “I was amazed to see the huge stacks of kites there. We used to call it the house of the kite maker.”In Nhyokha, Purna Bahadur Shrestha began making kites as a teenager and started his own kite business in the 1950s, according to his daughter Sajani.These kites, made out of Nepali paper, often had different paintings. Mishra recalls painting kites for the kite shop in Chabahil.“I went to that kite shop and with the freely available colours and Nepali papers, I spent my day painting faces, birds, animals, masks, mountains, hills, whatever came to my mind,” he writes in the book. “Such kites apparently sold well!”Most septuagenarians and older generations like Tuladhar and Tirtha Bahadur recall flying kites made of Nepali paper when young. Tirtha Bahadur says that kites from Lucknow began coming to Kathmandu only after the late 1950s. But at least a section of Kathmandu was flying kites from Lucknow from the early twentieth century. Vaidya, Manandhar and Joshi write that the Ranas and Shahs imported kites from Lucknow and that from them, their favourite employees also got to fly some. These kites were large and, in Tyas Bakhatko Nepal, Pande writes that they were referred to as Lucknowia kites.Known for their characteristic hissing sound they made while flying, light body, swift movement and ability to take sharp turns, Lucknow kites were preferred by kite fighters.“Lucknow kites were lighter and could be manoeuvred well,” says Tuladhar. “Kites of Nepali paper were stable but difficult to manoeuvre. They were also expensive. So only some fighters flew Nepali paper kites.”The kites had different names depending upon their designs and colours – Ambe (a heart in the centre), Dibdibe (chequered), Pakhete (a different coloured paper on one edge), Sete (white-coloured), Nilchi (blue-coloured), Rate (red-coloured) and so on.The kite fighters preferred the strong and sharp Hattimar reel that came on a small lattai. The Belchamar reel was cheaper but weaker and prone to be cut by other threads. Kite fliers and kite watchers on rooftops and open groundsBibek Shrestha, 57, and his two brothers took stacks of kites and climbed their rooftops. The rooftops around theirs in the neighbourhood of Nhyokha – in fact in all core settlements of the Valley – were filled with kite fliers and spectators. Many risked precariously balancing on the sloped roofs.While Bibek and his brothers’ kites alighted to meet the sea of kites in the sky, their sister Sajani and other family members gathered around to revel in the live spectacle.Dhungel remembers the rooftops of Jhochhen and surroundings of the 1950s and 1960s swelled with kite fliers. Dhungel did try to fly kites. But he did not become a successful kite flyer. What he did become was, like Sajani and many Kathmandu residents, an admirer of kites soaring in the sky.“But more than engaging in my unsuccessful kite flying attempts, I enjoyed looking at the kites flying. There would be a big crowd of spectators. Females and other family members watched the kites fly as they ate meat and chiura. Some even drank and rejoiced as they flew kites.”When the age of cassette player and speakers dawned in the 1980s, songs blared from the speakers alongside kite flying. Chitrakar and Bibek invited their friends, put their favourite songs on speakers and spent entire afternoons flying kites, dancing, singing and eating.Away from the core cities, in the villages in the Valley, people flew kites in open fields. Like Dibya, who set his kite for flight from the banks of Godavari River in Tikathali. Chhauni was also a popular space for flying kites.Kathmandu’s joy in kite fightingBibek pulled his kite down and then manoeuvred it back up so his line touched his opponent's line from below and quickly reeled out his line. The resulting sharpness from the speed cut the opponent's line.Chaaaiiitttt………“The greatest fun comes from cutting another kite's string,” writes Tuladhar in his 1996 article “Cutting is the greatest fun” published in magazine Kite Lines. “With its coating of adhesive paste and ground glass, the string is as sharp and abrasive as sandpaper on your opponent's line.”Nepali kite, Tuladhar says, is made to fight other kites, and describes how a kite line cuts the other.“The technique is to touch your rival's string and immediately reel out line at high speed,” he writes. “The Nepalese style of kite flying is aggressive, and though the kites look simple, they are strategically designed for bringing down other kites.”At any given time, like Bibek’s kite above Nhyokha sky, skies above the Valley were filled with raging kites, swinging, coming down and going up as the fighters reeled in and out their lattais in ferocious attempts to bring down other kites.Meanwhile spectators cheered. “Even passersby stopped to look at the kites,” recalls Tina.The moment of a kite cutting was accompanied by the sound of chait, and children ran in the direction of the falling kite to grab it and the thread in what was termed as, Dibya says, changa lutne/dhago lutne.Dhungel always joined in to shout the chait resounding through the locality of Jhochhen and almost automatically his feet sped towards the severed kites' direction.“‘Oii leave that thread,’ the kite owner would scold me. ‘Why do you pull my thread, leave it right now.’ But I’d continue pulling the threads as the owner continued shouting. Other times I caught the kites that had failed to fly and dropped on the ground.”The fallen kites got stuck in the buildings, trees or poles, or glided down in the open grounds or paddy fields. Falling kites from the Kathmandu core settled down in Tundikhel covering it. Oftentimes kites fell on the fields to rest upon the lush paddy nearing its harvest.“Children ran straight into the fields to catch the kite,” says Dibya. \"They destroyed the crops by stepping on them. Some farmers chased them, scolding along as they did so and if they caught anyone, they slapped them.”Love and restrictions on kiteAmidst the raging kite fights high up in the sky, there were apparently also some quieter kites lingering much lower among the buildings or tree lines, for their goals lay in not ruthlessly cutting the threads of other kites but piercing softly through the hearts of their owners' love interests. During the Rana regime, there were designated public spaces to fly kites, writes Gautam in his article. Referring to oral accounts, he writes that the Ranas were particularly careful to avoid kite flyers around their durbars. This is because love-stricken men tied letters to kites and flew them into the durbars to their love interests among the nanis.He writes that the kites could be flown mainly on the grounds of Chhauni. Anyone flying kites in any other place and around Rana durbars were arrested.Pant also recalls love-stricken boys from his time. “Just as kites came in different colours and patterns, so did kite flyers,” he writes in the article. “Some wrote love letters using a few words in “symbolic language” on a plain kite and attempted to land it on the rooftop of the girl they liked. Some simply landed their kites on any rooftop if a girl appeared there and waited for reaction.”King Tribhuvan among kite fliersPande writes in his book: “Once or twice during kite season every year, King Tribhuvan went to Chhauni to fly kites. Legend has it that if the line of the king’s kite was cut, it flew to Lhasa. But since anyone who caught that kite received five rupees, everyone attempted to catch that kite.”In 2021 news report ‘Bhawanle Chhekidiyo Changa Udaune Aakash’ by Shivahari Ghimire published in Nayapatrika, cultural expert the late Satyamohan Joshi also recounts that “During Dashain, Tribhuvan came to the ground below Swayambhu to fly kites. […] He did not use the same thread to fly kites twice.”In the same article, Joshi says that the King also went to Budhanilakantha to fly kites and participate in kite flying competitions.End of season, end of cultureMohan Krishna Shrestha, 86, was born in Budhanilakantha. Every year, on the day of Haribodhini Ekadashi, he saw the annual fair at the Budhanilakantha Temple. He also witnessed kite fliers gathered in the open fields around the Temple.“Oh, it’d be a lot of people,” says Shrestha. “They came from all around Bhaktapur, Kathmandu and Lalitpur.”They flew kites on Ekadashi, Dwadashi and some even until Purnima.“They took all the remaining threads and kites that had survived Dashain and flew the last kites of the season,” says Tuladhar. “I remember my uncles, relatives and neighbours going to Budhanilakantha with their kites.”Joshi recalls in the 2021 article that King Tribhuvan also went to Budhanilakantha with his sons Mahendra, Himalaya and Basundhara. He greatly supported and also participated in the competitions there organised by the commoners. If he liked he gave prize money to the winners.This annual event lost its glory days after the decline in the open fields as buildings began to rise with the establishment of Budhanilkantha School in 1972, Mohan says.“The event survived in some form until the 1990s,” he says.But what happened after that?The end-of-the-season event in the 1990s was also an indication of the end of the age-old kite tradition.“If I go to my ancestral place in Asan to fly kites, it’s not possible for me to do that today because there are buildings everywhere,” says Tuladhar. “Cityscapes and urbanisation have created the obstacle for flying kites.”Dibya does feel like flying kites sometimes.“No space to fly kites today,” he says. “In the old times, there were river banks and open fields. Even if you fly kites, it gets stuck in somebody's rooftop or water tank or somewhere.”Yesteryear’s kite enthusiasts believe that increasing means of entertainment was another reason for the decline of kite culture.“When television came, kite flying started to slowly decrease,” says Bibek. “And then mobile phones robbed kite flying even more.”And so, when his sister Sajani cranes her neck up in the sky today, she rarely sees a kite.“Those days we heard one chait after another,” she says. “These days you won’t hear a single chait.” \nIn 2008 Matina Shakya was only three years old when she was appointed as the Kumari of Kathmandu. She was succeeded by Trishna Shakya as the new Kumari in 2017.Kumaris are revered as goddesses of beauty and strength in certain Hindu and Buddhist traditions. Worshipping young girls as Kumaris is a 2,000-year-old practice in Nepal. Since the 13th century, when the Malla kings ruled, the Newars of the Kathmandu Valley have been worshipping Kumari, a girl from the Shakya/Bajracharya community chosen to embody the divine energy of goddess Taleju Bhawani. The reign of a Kumari ends when she starts menstruating. So long as she is serving as the Kumari, she is believed to be the nation’s divine protector, safeguarding it from evil. Matina, 18, is now in her first year of college, studying for a bachelor’s degree in management. Her father, Pratapman Shakya, when asked about having a daughter who is the only living the goddess in the world said, “Not having your own daughter live in the same house as you seemed a little unfair, but we feel very proud to call ourselves the parents of the royal Kumari who is revered by people all over the world.”On March 9, 2023, he, along with Matina, were getting ready for a special function held to honour all former Kumaris from across Nepal. “There are often events to honour Matina as she was the royal Kumari, but this one was dedicated to all former Kumaris from different areas. There are 129 living Kumaris in all,” he added. Besides Kathmandu, Kumari tradition is followed in Bhaktapur, Lalitpur, and Kirtipur, among other cities.According to him, this was the first time an event like this was organised and the Deputy Mayor of Kathmandu, Sunita Dangol, was also in attendance.Throughout the year, many people line up outside the ‘Kumari Ghar’ to get a chance to visit the Kumari and get her blessings. Many foreigners stand out in the yard to catch a glimpse of her. Nepali people believe that if a Kumari smiles at you, it is a bad omen.Everyday, a tutor visits the Kumari to help her continue with her education as she is not allowed to step outside the Kumari Ghar. She takes her exams and does her homework from the Kumari Ghar itself. She also has the freedom to play inside the Kumari Ghar. Many former kumaris have pursued careers in their fields of interest or studied after their term ends, and they continue to be treated with the same respect. The tradition of Kumari has evolved over time. In the past Kumaris did not enjoy these freedoms.Because of various superstitious beliefs, Kumaris were not fully educated and were forbidden from getting married because of the belief that the groom would die soon if he married an ex-Kumari. They led secluded lives, were restricted from participating in normal childhood activities, and focused solely on their religious duties.However, now, these myths have been dispelled. Modern understanding has shifted to recognise that Kumaris, after stepping down from their divine role, have the freedom to marry and lead a normal life. The perception of Kumaris as isolated figures has evolved, with a focus on providing them with a more balanced upbringing. There have been initiatives to integrate Kumaris into regular social and educational settings, allowing them to have a more holistic and fulfilling childhood experience. “Matina was already familiar with the students from the school that she attended after her term as Kumari ended,” said Shakya. “The kids visited the Kumari Ghar frequently so that she could have a smooth transition,” he added. According to Gautam Prasad Shakya, who has been living as a caretaker in the Kumari Ghar, the changes made to the tradition are minor. “The traditions of Kumari have mostly stayed the same. All the rituals are still practised like in the old days,” he said.On 6 May 2005, Pun Devi Maharjan, a lawyer, filed a case in the Supreme Court claiming that the traditional practice of electing young girls as Kumaris, or “goddesses’, who are expected to follow certain social restrictions and appear at religious festivals, violated the rights of the child. Quoting Maharjan’s complaint, Puskar Mathema writes in Yuwamanch Monthly of October 2007, “If Kumari tradition is continued, it will undermine the fundamental rights as well the freedoms of children guaranteed by the constitution and child rights treaties. Apart from this, it will have a negative impact on their physical and mental development.”The case continued while Nepal overthrew the monarchy and declared itself a secular state in 2007. When the judgement was pronounced in 2008, the goddess was still in her role, now giving blessings to the country’s President. The court ordered that the Kumaris and ex-Kumaris receive better benefits and arrangements and ordered the government to improve their support and allowances.In April 2006, Prof Chunda Bajracharya filed a petition at the Supreme Court against Maharjan’s petition, who had argued against the Kumari tradition. Bajracharya contended that the tradition should be preserved as heritage due to its over 100 years of history.“People who don’t understand the culture shouldn’t comment on it,” she stated. Bajracharya also criticised the human right activists who contended that Kumaris were only allowed to wear the colour red. “People who say Kumaris are forced to wear red clothing all the time, are the same people who send their kids to schools in uniform,” she said.“After the 2008 court verdict, there have been a lot of improvements. Now, a teacher visits the Kumari Ghar daily to tutor the Kumari, who is expected to complete school assignments and sit periodic exams. All the former Kumaris now get benefits like scholarships and special pensions,” she added.Bajracharya is currently a professor of literature at the Tribhuvan University in Kathmandu.“The only significant change that the court verdict brought to the tradition was in terms of her education,” said Gautam Prasad Shakya, the caretaker. “Kumaris were tutored long before the case, but the case helped formalise this arrangement. After the court verdict, the time between 12 pm and 4 pm was designated as the Kumari’s tuition time,” he added.After the verdict, there was a concerted effort to provide Kumaris with access to quality education, enabling them to develop the skills and knowledge needed to lead fulfilling lives beyond their divine roles. There was also a shift towards ensuring that the Kumari's living quarters are comfortable, safe, and conducive to her overall well-being.Moreover, the selection process for the Kumari underwent reforms in the aftermath of the Pun Devi Maharjan case. There was a push for greater transparency, accountability, and inclusivity in the selection of the Kumari, with an emphasis on ensuring that the process was fair, respectful, and free from undue influence.Efforts were made to support their transition into adulthood, including providing them with comprehensive resources for education, vocation, and social integration. This shift aimed to address the challenges faced by former Kumaris and empower them to lead independent and fulfilling lives after their divine service.“The Kumari tradition has evolved over time. During the tenure of my daughter, we saw a lot of improvements. Even after her time as Kumari, Matina continued to get a lot of government support,” said Shakya, former Kumari Matina’s father.“Some people argue that child rights are being violated, but all of her rights are being upheld inside the Kumari Ghar. This is a unique and respected aspect of Nepali culture, and I don’t believe it violates any of my child’s rights.”While the Kumari tradition continues, its practices have evolved. “She enjoys this normal life and it didn’t take her long to adjust as well,” says Matina’s father, on her transition from the revered Kumari to the ordinary Matina. \nWhat animals did Juddha Shumsher have in his zoo?“We only have records of animals from the mid-1960s,” says Ganesh Koirala, who has been employed at the Central Zoo for the past 36 years and currently serves as its information officer and programme officer. “That too I hand-copied from an old torn-down file that I came across.”Today, the Central Zoo, which sprawls across six hectares in Jawalakhel, Lalitpur, houses as many as 1,298 wild animals of different species of mammals, reptiles, fishes and birds from Nepal and around the world—from tiger, rhinoceros, hippopotamus and red panda to its recent attraction: a pair of chimpanzees.After enduring decades of neglect under various government bodies, with its animals and infrastructure scraping along in a deplorable state, the zoo received a new lease of life with improved infrastructure and animal care in 1995, when it came under the management of the King Mahendra Trust for Nature Conservation (KMTNC), now known as the National Trust for Nature Conservation, in 1995.Today, the Central Zoo is an entertainment venue, one of the most happening places in the Kathmandu valley. Flocked by thousands of daily visitors, the zoo now also hosts rescued animals and those in need of rehabilitation. It is also a site for conservation education.But when Juddha Shumsher Rana (prime minister from 1932–1945) built the Jawalakhel Zoological Garden on the premises of his Jawalakhel Durbar (where Nepal Administrative Staff College stands today) in 1932, he did so purely for private interests—as a space of entertainment and amusement for him and his family.Built in the semi-wilderness of Jawalakhel around a historical pond dating to the 17th century during the reign of King Siddhi Narsingh Malla, the zoo also became the space he could use to show his respect for two women he revered, his mother and sister-in-law, and indulge in one of his favourite pastimes—gambling.Today, the Central Zoo, nestled in the heart of Jawalakhel's sprawling crowd, does not go unnoticed, and its story is well told. But what passions drove Juddha to build the zoo? What was its original layout? What animals did it have in the beginning? And how did Juddha spend time there?“I remember once seeing a small board that read ‘Jawalakhel Zoological Garden’,” Koirala says. “I don’t know whether it was from Juddha’s time or was made in the later years. It must surely be that Juddha built the zoo out of influence from the British given how this term was used by them.”Koirala adds, “There is a former employee, now an elderly gentleman who worked in the zoo in the 1960s. He surely has some stories from Juddha’s time.”Birds, beasts and palacesTo trace the birth of Jawalakhel Zoological Garden, one has to look at the history of Nepal’s rulers owning birds and animals.Like rulers around the world, Nepal’s royalty kept wild and exotic birds and animals in captivity as a source of pleasure and mark of wealth and power. The book ‘Social History of Nepal’ by historians TR Vaidya, Tri Ratna Manandhar and Shankar Lal Joshi details how Mallas during the mediaeval Kathmandu Valley to Ranas and Shahs in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries owned rare, exotic creatures. In 1708, a rhinoceros in Kathmandu Valley broke the iron chain in which it was bound and killed its tamer. In 1714, Bhaktapur’s King Bhupatindra Malla gifted a camel and an elephant to Kantipur’s King Bhaskar Malla to build peace.Among Shahs, King Rana Bahadur Shah in particular was reputed for his collection of birds and animals. He also owned a zoo outside his palace in Basantapur Durbar Square, where the Nepal Bank Limited stands in New Road today. The zoo contained “tiger, bear, monkey, elephant, horse, deer… heron, peacock… pigeon, wild dogs, rabbits, rats, mongoose.”Jung Bahadur Rana’s zoo on the premises of his Thapathali Durbar hosted a variety of birds and animals collected during his hunting expeditions as well as those brought from abroad. Jung Bahadur himself used to “supervise and inspect it”. Juddha Shumsher likewise had his own collection of creatures which steadily expanded into a zoological garden. Seeking wilderness in his Jawalakhel DurbarJuddha’s biographer Ishwari Prasad writes in ‘The Life and Times of Maharaja Juddha Shumsher Jung Bahadur Rana’ that between 1933 and 1940, Juddha shot 433 tigers, 33 rhinoceros and 93 leopards. An insatiable big-game hunter, Juddha had a deep fondness for being in the wild and among wild animals, and from this came, according to oral history prevalent among members of Kathmandu’s Rana community including Juddha’s descendants, the desire to own a zoo.Built in 1752, Schönbrunn Zoo in Vienna, the world’s first modern zoo, was already over 100 years old when Juddha was born in 1875. London Zoo opened in 1828 and Alipore Zoological Garden (Kolkata Zoo) in 1875. Nawab Wajid Ali Shah Zoological Garden (Lucknow Zoo) was established in 1921. Juddha’s inspiration, his descendants say, was most likely reinforced by his tours to zoological gardens during his visits to England in 1908 and to different Indian cities.An article titled ‘Central zoo in state of neglect’ published in The Kathmandu Post in 1996 says that Juddha one day “received a pair of leopards as a gift”, cementing his desire to own a zoo. A report ‘Central Zoo Master Plan’ prepared by the KMTNC in 1996 says that Juddha decided to build a zoo in an epiphany when he saw that some animals “including deer, a few rhinos, and some tigers had been collected from the Tarai and kept in Kathmandu” could be put into one compound in the “lonely piece of land with a large 16th [sic] century Malla period Pokhari”.The pond lay still and serene surrounded by green wilderness ever since Patan’s King Siddhi Narsingh Malla built it in the 1600s. On the grounds surrounding this pond, the Newars from Na:Tole, Pulchowk and surroundings had their devisthans where, for centuries, they gathered to perform their religious ceremonies during Basanta Panchami and Bhoto Jatra even after this area fell within the Jawalakhel Durbar.For the palace, the ground served as its extended garden along with a horse and elephant stable. Subodh Rana, 69, grandson of Juddha Shumsher, recalled his father Kiran Shumsher telling him that Juddha and his family sometimes also used the scenic grounds for picnics. If there was any spot where Juddha wanted to build a menagerie, it would be around this Pokhari (pond). One day, he called his grandson General Maheshwar Shumsher Rana and deputed him to the task of doing just this.The zoo’s layout—except for the small plots of lands acquired later—that was in place when it came under KMTNC's management was, the present and retired zoo officials believe, mostly the same as it was built by Maheshwar and so offers a peek into how Juddha’s zoo must have been like. Pond in the middle of the ground surrounded by enclosures—the southern bank housing mainly larger animals, and cages for birds positioned on the northern banks.From pigeons to the king of the jungleWhat animals and birds did the enclosures at Juddha’s zoo house?“We cannot tell for sure,” Koirala says.Once it came under government ownership, the zoo was tossed from one institution to the other for lack of interest and knowledge on the right institution to manage it. Amid all this chaos, documents were possibly lost and the zoo has no concrete record about the animals that Juddha must have once taken amusement at, said Koirala.Mukti Narayan Shrestha, 82, a retired secretary of the Nepal government, joined the Central Zoo in 1970 as a veterinarian when many original structures of the zoo were still intact. Shrestha also worked with an elderly khardar who, he says, was employed in the zoo since the time of Juddha and was about to retire when he joined.“In those days where the purpose of menageries was exclusively for exhibition and pleasure with no regard for the welfare and recreation of animals and birds, the cages were tiny and iron-barred,” Shrestha says.Elephant, horses, deer, monkeys, tiger, rhinoceros, clouded leopard, red panda, bear, palm civet (nir biralo), four-horned antelope, Himalayan goral, pheasants, Himalayan monal—from the mythical and the majestic, the gentle and friendly to the fiery and ferocious, Juddha’s zoo boasted them all, Shrestha says.Shrestha’s account is not different from the anecdotes passed down to other retired and present zoo officials and the members of the Rana community, who also detail the rare and the exotic fauna, like the gharial crocodile and porcupine, even the jungle’s king—creatures, they say, that Juddha must have received from foreigners as gifts—appearing alongside domestic birds like pigeons.Tidbits of published information also confirm that the zoo had a good collection of exotic birds and animals from Nepal and abroad. One such suggestion comes from Kalyan Shumsher’s ‘Shree Teen Juddha Mahima’ published during Juddha’s reign in 1943.“One need not travel abroad to see the incredible birds and animals found in foreign countries,” he writes. “It will suffice to see [those creatures] right here in the zoo opened by His Holiness Shree 3 [Juddha] in Jawalakhel.”Among these incredible creatures, one reigned supreme—lion, the king of the jungle.For one, it would not have satiated Juddha to build a zoo and not have the jungle’s king exhibited in it. Juddha hence must have done everything possible to ensure one for the zoo. Infrastructure at the zoo suggests that the lion indeed lived at Juddha’s zoo or, in the least, during the Rana regime.“Where bear habitat lies today, there were two dome-shaped attached enclosures with a holding room, constructed in the classic architecture that many enclosures in the British zoos had in the past. They had brick walls and lime plaster,” Koirala says. “These were built to house a lion in one cage and a tiger in the other.”Near these enclosures stood another cage that remains intact today, with the head of a roaring lion carved out of the wall on the top of its iron bars. Zoo officials as well as members of the Rana community believe that Juddha had this exhibit built to specifically house a lion.Remarkably, these Juddha-era infrastructural spaces are corroborated by a rare piece of photographic evidence. A 1946 photo of the zoo shows a lion while a Kathmandu mother and her sons stand in front of its cage.Juddha’s place of piety and playThe zoo was not merely a space that Juddha sought out for amusement and retreat in the outpost of his palace; he also used this place to express his deepest affection.This affection spills right at the zoo’s entrance, in the form of the life-size statue of Karma Kumari Devi, wife of Juddha’s elder brother and Rana Prime Minister Dev Shumsher. Karma Kumari stands tall in her regal costume shaded by a wide canopy. Juddha revered Karma Kumari because it was she who raised him and looked after his mother Juhar Kumari Devi after the death of his father Dhir Shumsher. On another prominent part of the zoo on the south-east, Juhar Kumari’s enthroned statue overlooks the pond. Juddha had commissioned the London-based sculptor Domenico Antonio Tonelli to cast these statues.When Karma Kumari’s statue was unveiled is not clear, but Juhar Kumari’s statue was unveiled by Juddha amid a grand function in 1935 on Jawalakhel’s most auspicious day, Bhoto Jatra. It was attended by the British Resident Frederick Bailey.“On June 28, 1935, at Jawalakhel Durbar… the pond nearby looked very scenic,” says a Gorkhapatra news report titled ‘Statue installation’ dated July 5, 1935. “Because it was the day of Bhoto Jatra of Machhindranath… and moreover since an ideal woman’s statue was being unveiled, there was a crowd of lakhs of people.”Less than fifty metres from Karma Kumari’s statue stands a one-story building with a pagoda roof that today serves as the zoo’s meeting hall. Juddha, an avid gambler, found the scenic semi-wilderness covered in trees and filled with the sounds of wildlife to be a perfect place to relish the game. So he built a building with twelve doors on its four sides allowing him and his fellow gambling compatriots the freedom to enter through a particular door that they thought would bring luck. He called it his Juwa Ghar, the gambling house, and built it with the sole purpose of indulging in the game he loved. Roar of lion reverberates in KathmanduThe sounds of the animals and birds in the zoo rose up in the Jawalakhel sky. Every day, until much later in the 1970s, roar of the zoo’s lion (there were later other lions) diffused to far corners of the Valley, merging the zoo with the spirit of Kathmandu and informing the city folks of its presence.But was the zoo open to the public as well?“I think once it was built, the zoo was open for the public,” Subodh Rana said. “It is unlikely that Juddha Shumsher built such a large zoo and kept it only for his family.”For one, Kalyan Shumsher mentioning that one “need not travel abroad to see the incredible birds and animals found in foreign countries” suggests that the public had at least some access to the zoo. Of course, the Newar community from Na:Tole, Pulchowk and surrounding areas were permitted inside the zoo on the days of their guthi functions on Basanta Panchami and Bhoto Jatra.As the zoo was established at the back of the ground where Bhoto Jatra celebrations happen, it naturally filled with revellers on this day in addition to the guthi ritual observers as testified by the Gorkhapatra report. The photo of the mother and her sons also bear testimony that the zoo was not entirely closed to the public.What is widely believed, though, is that the zoo officially came under government ownership after Nepal became a democracy in 1951. And it would still be a few more years before it was open to the public in 1956.In 1945, Juddha gave up his power and eventually retired in Dehradun, India, where he died in 1952. With time, Jawalakhel Zoological Garden became the Central Zoo. It would take many avatars—a neglected site of crammed, unmaintained cages with sad eyes of emaciated creatures staring from behind the bars, a focal point of animal diplomacy, particularly during the period of monarchy, to, in its recent decades, a space of conservation and education.When all this was happening, the city sprawled around Jawalakhel, subduing the lion’s roar with its noise. More wildlife from around the country and the world came—creatures captured from the wild, those sold by circuses, those rescued from traffickers. Fate would bring these creatures to the care of generations of Kathmandu folks, intertwining each other’s joys and sorrows. After the tale of Juddha’s Jawalakhel Zoological Garden, there would be these stories to tell. Sitting around a table inside Juddha’s Juwa Ghar, Koirala and other zoo officials begin unfolding these stories before me. \nEarlier this week, Prime Minister and CPN-UML Chair KP Sharma Oli completed five months in office. His tango with Nepali Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba seems to be proceeding well. Over the last few months, the top leaders of Nepal’s two major political parties have been excessively focused on not offending each other, as doing so could tip the balance.Since this new coalition was formed without a clear vision, it failed to inspire confidence from the outset. Hence, on the delivery front, the Oli administration was bound to fail.The CPN-UML and the Nepali Congress decided to join forces with the promise of amending the constitution to ensure political stability. Over the past months, the two parties have offered numerous reasons for forming the coalition, but none involve the constitutional amendment issue, as if it has vanished from their agenda.Neither party has provided answers about the amendment process, likely because they don’t have one.While an amendment to the constitution is not inherently problematic, there must be a clear rationale. The justification the two parties offered was so flimsy that it was evident from the start that their amendment rhetoric was just a ruse. Even if they are committed to their promise, it remains a misguided priority. The need of the hour is addressing more urgent matters, such as good governance and service delivery, which are directly linked to citizens.Misplaced priorityNepal’s major political parties—the NC, the UML and the CPN (Maoist Centre)—seem to have little confidence in the constitution they once championed through majoritarian dominance. Dissenting voices were ignored, suppressed and silenced.They once called it the world’s best but are now finding fault with it—not because it has caused problems for the people but because it obstructs their pursuit of majority governments. At least, this has been the argument of the UML and the Congress of late because they are the largest parties and are aiming for a majority in the next elections. Nevertheless, once promulgated, it was incumbent upon Nepali parties to focus on full implementation of the constitution. This required following due processes—enacting laws, devolving power and strengthening institutions. However, none of the parties paid attention to these fundamentals. Instead, they treated the constitution as a tool to “rule” when the charter required them to “govern.”Post-2015, Nepali parties had only two key responsibilities—governance and constitution implementation. They failed on both fronts, especially because they were excessively involved in the game of one-upmanship. These key duties were thus relegated to the back burner.Spirit of the constitutionA pluralist, inclusive, progressive and peaceful society was the core idea of the constitution. But this very spirit is under threat from the parties that are supposed to safeguard it, as they have failed to internalise the concept of constitutionalism in its true sense.Nepali politicians often cite the holding of two sets of national, provincial and local elections within the prescribed timeframe and the formation of governments to argue that democracy is functioning in Nepal. While this reasoning has merit, democracy’s full functionality depends on its realisation at the grassroots and among the people.True upholding of constitutionalism means abiding by its principles, respecting its limitations and adhering to the rule of law. Only then can the pluralistic, inclusive and progressive society envisioned by the constitution be built.Stable and accountable governance entails adherence to the rule of law, the protection of individual rights and the separation of powers.But questions remain: Have successive governments, regardless of which parties or leaders led them, fully complied with the laws? Has the system of checks and balances been allowed to operate fully in both letter and spirit?Constitutional moralityTrue implementation of the constitution depends on constitutionalism, which itself is rooted in constitutional morality—embracing not just legal provisions but also the underlying democratic values of justice, equality and respect for individual rights. Unfortunately, this idea—that the constitution is not just a guidebook setting the rules but a moral document—is sorely lacking among Nepali parties and politicians.The waning morality among Nepali parties has emerged as a troubling trend. Their pursuit of power and self-interest takes precedence over addressing citizens’ concerns. Since the UML and the Congress—historically rival parties—formed the new coalition, they have started floating the idea of a two-party system. While this notion is unlikely to materialise anytime soon, it does indicate their broader aim. Beneath the veneer of their argument for stability through a two-party system lies a dangerous intent to muzzle multi-party democracy, one of the basic tenets of the constitution, and to rule in turns.Coupled with this is yet another worrying concern: Internal democracy has been on the wane within Nepali political parties. Majoritarianism rules the roost in major parties, raising the risk that the same approach will manifest when they come to power. Democracy thrives when institutions are strong, but they have been weakened by the parties’ disregard for the separation of powers. Weak institutions, a lack of morality and an utter disregard for the rule of law create the perfect conditions for majoritarian tendencies to rear their ugly head.‘We, the People’The most worrying issue today is that political parties do not want to confront the most pressing issues of the day, which actually concern the people.While they harp on the constitution—and even warn that the statute is under threat—they ignore the fact that it will continue to face risks as long as they fail to ensure that the spirit of the charter resonates with ordinary people.The worry today is not just that Nepali parties are falling short on the delivery front; it is that the gains made so far could be in danger.The incumbent UML-Congress coalition, if genuinely committed to the welfare of ordinary citizens, must pause and reassess its priorities. Their survival and political relevance depend on embracing the politics of citizenry and addressing the pressing needs of the people they are meant to serve.Lest they forget, the ultimate power rests with “We, the People,” as the constitution declares. \nPrint journalism is in a state of crisis. The circulation of newspapers in India seems to have stagnated in relation to population growth, meaning the proportion of people reading printed news has dropped. More readers are turning to free online news sources and circulation growth is failing to keep up with demographic expansion. Given India’s vast population—nearly 10 times that of Japan—it is concerning that India has only as many newspapers with over a million in circulation as Japan.If this decline in print journalism is not addressed, it could as well pose a serious threat to the fundamental values of our democracy. The potential consequences of this decline are too grave to ignore. There is no such thing as free news, just as there is no such thing as a free lunch. Free online news is not truly free; it comes with hidden costs, such as algorithms similar to those on social media—that prioritise sensationalist stories, fuelling misinformation and polarisation. ‘Brain rot’, named Oxford Word of the Year 2024, is defined as “the supposed deterioration of a person’s mental or intellectual state, especially viewed as the result of overconsumption of material (now particularly online content) considered to be trivial or unchallenging.” The usage of the word saw an increase of 230 percent in its frequency from 2023 to 2024. Oxford University Press’s announcement of the Word of the Year sparked debate about the potential negative impact of excessive online content consumption on mental health, particularly in children and young people. According to Newport Institute in the US, one brain rot behaviour is doom scrolling, involving long periods of searching for negative and distressing news online; and consequences include difficulty organising information, solving problems, making decisions, and recalling information. The Institute advises, “Don’t succumb to sensationalistic and negative news. Diversify your media sources so you maintain a more balanced world perspective.” Unlike online outlets focused on short, click-driven pieces, print newspapers offer curated in-depth coverage of current events. The details that could be captured by such reporting are things the small articles or social media posts dominating the digital landscape will never be able to capture. Printed newspapers have kept high editorial standards and leave a permanent record that is also transparent. Digital stories, by contrast, can be edited, removed or simply lost. In an era where fake news spreads rapidly on social media, print newspapers remain a trusted source of verified information. Japan’s strong newspaper circulation demonstrates the enduring value of print media. Leading dailies like Yomiuri Shimbun and Asahi Shimbun sell millions of daily copies. This cultural preference for physical newspapers is reflected in the popularity of newspaper clubs, found in schools, universities and community centres. By discussing and analysing news stories, members of these clubs develop deep appreciation for journalism and learn to be active, responsible citizens, which is crucial for a healthy democracy. Commonly, online news platforms use algorithms that only feed the users news they are already interested in, reducing exposure to a broader range of information. This trend undermines the financial viability of traditional media while promoting a media landscape dominated by clickbait reporting. Ironically, when print newspapers disappear, the future of online news is also at stake. The sustainability of digital journalism depends on the investigative and qualitative reporting that traditional print media does. Without print outlets holding power to account and investing in journalism, the quality of online news could significantly decline, littered with sensationalism and disinformation. Australia has recognised this challenge and taken bold initiatives to protect journalism. In 2021, Australia introduced the Treasury Laws Amendment (News Media and Digital Platforms Mandatory Bargaining Code) Act 2021 a world-first legislation aimed at helping to sustain public interest journalism. The law requires tech giants like Google and Facebook to pay news organisations for sharing their content. Australia’s success motivated other nations: Canada and Indonesia are planning similar codes. During his National Press Day address, Union Minister of Information and Broadcasting Ashwini Vaishnaw remarked that traditional content must be fairly compensated to preserve its value. India should follow Australia’s example by ensuring tech platforms pay for news content while media houses promote affordable digital subscriptions to compete with free aggregators. The government and media need to act together. We must recognise the value of paying for credible news, particularly by subscribing to print newspapers. Purchasing a newspaper supports quality journalism and ensures that high standards of reporting continue. A national campaign should be launched to encourage every household in India to subscribe to at least one print newspaper. Campaigns could include media literacy programmes highlighting the risks of free online news and the importance of investing in credible sources. Increased circulation boosts advertising revenue, providing newspapers with resources to fund high-quality journalism. Participating in democracy is not just about casting a vote—it is about staying informed and supporting credible journalism. It is time for a campaign encouraging every home in India to subscribe to a print newspaper, as the future of our democracy depends on it. Madhav is a transparency and equality advocate and an author.—The Statesman (India) / ANN \nCorruption ails almost every sector in Nepal. It is believed to be one major factor discouraging investors, innovators, entrepreneurs, as well as service seekers. But following tremendous pressure from various sections of the society, government authorities have initiated investigations on some major corruption cases. The fake Bhutanese refugee scam, Lalita Niwas land grab, Tribhuvan University land encroachment, gold smuggling and cooperatives deposits embezzlement are cases that have been probed. Even high profile personalities such as a former Speaker, former ministers, top bureaucrats and powerful middlemen have been prosecuted.Currently, the embezzlement of billions of rupees deposited by thousands of people at hundreds of cooperatives across the country remains a hotly-debated issue. Politicians, a former top police official, and key officials running dozens of cooperatives are being investigated. Police have issued red corner notices against those who are on the run after embezzling deposits from various cooperatives. The Rastriya Swatantra Party chair and former home minister Rabi Lamichhane, among other suspects, has been in custody for the past two months over his alleged involvement in the embezzlement. But other politicians and individuals close to top political leaders have been spared, it is alleged, under political pressure. Just like Lamichhane, Nepali Congress Vice-President and lawmaker Dhan Raj Gurung, and federal parliament’s Public Accounts Committee chair Rishikesh Pokharel of the CPN-UML have been linked to the cases of embezzlement of funds from different cooperatives. Yet they were not being probed. Thankfully, there has been a breakthrough. The Morang District Court on Tuesday issued an arrest warrant against 25 suspects including Anjala Koirala, wife of PAC chair Pokharel, in connection with alleged financial irregularities in Uma-Gauri Agricultural Cooperative. Yet little seems to be happening in the case against Gurung. The Central Investigation Bureau of Nepal Police had in October recommended the police headquarter issue a red notice against Gurung’s former wife Jyoti, among others, on charges of embezzling cooperative deposits. Though Dhan Raj and Jyoti officially appear to have divorced, it seems the two were still jointly misusing funds even after the formal divorce. Also, the cross-party Parliamentary Special Probe Committee has suggested the authorities investigate the Congress leader’s involvement.When it comes to past investigations in major corruption scandals, the results have been mixed. The investigation agencies have produced some laudable results in a few cases, while they were criticised in other scams for sparing politicians while punishing civil servants and other individuals. So people still doubt their role. Many people believe investigating agencies, under pressure from influential leaders, first spare the politicians and their kin or, even if they are arrested, the cases against them are watered down to help the suspects get clean chit. Though cases were filed against high profile individuals in the fake refugee case, Lalita Niwas and gold smuggling scams, many of them have already been acquitted. People are thus rightly suspicious. To remove their doubts, first, the agencies should show the courage to work independently and stop waiting for signals from top politicians. Or the flawed justice process will backfire on the top politicians too. If the public comes to see that only those without access to power centres get punished while those close to top politicians and other power centres are spared, their faith in the country’s legal process will erode. So will their trust in the political parties. Now that investigation has started against the spouse of an UML leader, there should now be no delay in probing the Congress leader too.   \nFor years, politics has taken precedence over progress in Nepal’s higher education. Political parties have turned educational institutions into their playgrounds, weakening the foundation and values of these establishments. This is evident in the recent hullabaloo over the appointment of deans at Tribhuvan University (TU), Nepal’s oldest. The dean positions were vacant since June this year, and disagreements in the executive council over the selections had hindered the selection process before Dashain. The major political parties and their student unions did their best to manipulate the merit-based appointment system, while criticising each other for ‘politicising’ higher education. The tug-of-war between the parties finally ended with the appointment of deans in five study institutes and three faculties of the university. However, these appointments have once again laid bare the practice of bhagbanda between the CPN-UML, the Nepali Congress, and the CPN (Maoist Centre).For fair selection, the executive council issued procedures for appointing deans and formed recommendation committees to suggest candidates based on merit. However, these committees have no more than symbolic value in a country where corruption seeps into the very systems intended to eradicate it. When vice-chancellor Keshar Jung Baral tried to appoint the deans and campus chiefs based on “meritocracy”, the recommendation committee did not rank professors affiliated with the UML on top. This did not please the UML and Baral was criticised at the University’s senate meeting. Although the UML’s protest reflects its vested interests, Baral’s claim of merit-based dean recommendation is contaminated by his own controversial past, raising doubts over his intent. In February, then-Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal had appointed Baral as vice-chancellor even though he was second in line after Chitra Bahadur Budhathoki.To sum up, meritocracy was seen only on paper, as wherever there was political interest, selections weren’t based on merit. Ultimately this time, three Congress-affiliated professors, and two each from the UML and the Maoist Centre, were appointed deans, in addition to one with no clear political ties. It is now well established that politicisation of higher education does a lot of harm. Once renowned for its academic excellence, India’s Jawaharlal Nehru University has devolved into a hotspot for political unrest, with strikes and protests harming its academic standing. Similarly, Karachi University in Pakistan has suffered a lot from political polarisation, resulting in on-campus violence and administrative blunders.The logic is straightforward: Those who have mastered academia are best equipped to understand and manage educational institutions. However, such reasoning does not work in Tribhuvan University, where the chancellor, the highest-ranking official in the university, is the prime minister. Although the universities’ laws authorise the prime minister, as an ex-officio chancellor, to appoint vice-chancellors from among the three names recommended by the search committees, the prime minister typically appoints individuals aligned with their party, triggering a domino effect that ultimately undermines the merit-based system. Such unnatural appointments to major positions in educational institutions in turn disrupt the university’s intellectual ecosystem. It is high time we got to the root of politicisation of education and nipped it in the bud. The political parties cannot be allowed to use educational institutions as an extension of party organisations and risk the future of hundreds of thousands of students. At a time when we are witnessing a mass exodus of students due to their increasing distrust in our higher education, political parties must step aside and allow those who understand the institutions the best to lead. It is about time we created an education system that works for the benefit of students rather than politicians. \nEvery year, the Everest region, one of Nepal’s major tourist hubs, draws thousands of mountaineers, trekkers, and high-end (luxury) tourists from the world over. Helicopter sightseeing, which is as popular as trekking and mountain climbing, caters to tourists willing to spend generously to get a close glimpse of Mount Everest, the tallest mountain in the world. Such sightseeing adventures also significantly benefit hotels, airlines, local businesses and the country’s overall economy. However, starting January 1, 2025, the Sagarmatha National Park has decided to impose a blanket ban on helicopter sightseeing tours in the region. This has sparked an acrimonious debate among stakeholders.This seemingly lucrative tourism practice has a darker side. While helicopters support tourism in the national park and surrounding region, they are harmful to the wild animals living in the park’s relatively undisturbed areas. According to official data, there are over 6,000 chopper flights in the Everest region during spring and autumn—the peak tourist seasons. These flights cause excessive noise pollution and disrupt the wildlife’s feeding and breeding patterns. Low-flying helicopters are particularly dangerous to the Himalayan Tahr and Himalayan Goral. According to park sources, some animals are dying by jumping off the cliffs due to the abrupt, loud noises of the choppers. Others are fleeing their natural habitats and straying into nearby villages where they pose challenges to local communities. Thus the park’s concern about wildlife is understandable. It is also home to the world’s rarest species, including snow leopards and red pandas. The protection of these animals cannot be overlooked as it helps maintain biodiversity and contributes to wildlife tourism. According to park officials, other reasons, including haphazard landing of the copters and suspicion of transport of wildlife contraband also prompted them to take such an action. However, the abrupt and arbitrary manner in which the ban was imposed is concerning as it will affect the region’s tourism. Tour operators, helicopter companies, as well as the Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal, the country’s civil aviation regulator, have criticised the ban made without consultations and exploration of alternatives. The CAAN has also clarified that the park has no legal basis to enforce such a ban.Nepal’s tourism sector is still in the post-Covid recovery phase. To make things worse, the European Union has extended its ban on Nepali airlines. Entrepreneurs who have invested in tourism are still suffering big losses. At this juncture, high-end tourism products like helicopter sightseeing could be a lifesaver for the ailing industry. So rather than blaming each other, the park and civil aviation authorities should try to find common ground and opt for a more balanced approach. As experts have suggested, establishing designated flight corridors away from sensitive wildlife habitats or conservation areas could be a viable solution to cut noise pollution. If concerns of the national park authority related to contraband and haphazard landings are genuine, monitoring activities in the region should be strengthened, and the aviation watchdog should hold the operators involved accountable. Wildlife and tourism are lifelines of our economy and there is a need to maintain a calibrated balance between the two. We believe, with a little more thought, a way can be worked out for them to coexist.  \nMany of Nepal’s online media outlets seem to be peddling more misinformation than news. The social media likewise is littered with content that more often divides than it connects people. So it should be great news that the Cabinet has given its go-ahead to a bill to regulate online content. Without some regulation, the government argues, things could soon get out of hand: With communities fighting each other, national sovereignty coming under threat and the society heading towards total anarchy. But that is just one side of the picture. What we have seen in recent times is successive governments trying to stifle free speech in the name of regulation. Look beyond the gloss of ‘safeguarding the society’, and the goal seems to control anti-government narratives. Otherwise, such laws would precede broad consultations with relevant stakeholders in the media and civil society. Those who have seen the bill say some of its provisions will give unelected government bodies great discretion to decide what is appropriate to be posted online. There is as such plenty of room for abuse. Yet the government seems intent on promulgating it at the earliest. Minister for Information and Communication Prithvi Subba Gurung has been pushing Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli to enact it through an ordinance. As he puts it, “It is already too late to regulate online media”. That would be unwise. Yes, there is a lot of noise online, and it is often hard to separate fact from fiction, confusing and frustrating people. This is why judicious regulation of online content is vital. Yet we should always keep in mind that when it comes to regulating free speech, less is more. Once you start nitpicking about what is socially acceptable content and what is not, it can be a slippery slope towards full-blown control. Whatever its other demerits, Nepal today stands tall as the freest country in South Asia where opinions from all political and social shades can be fearlessly voiced. This is something the country should cherish and look to capitalise on. One reason Nepal has not gone the Bangladesh way despite a similar level of public resentment against its political class is that at least Nepali citizens get to freely vent their frustrations. On the other hand, the draconian repression on free speech in Bangladesh had created a pressure cooker of discontent that ultimately exploded. Even in other parts of South Asia, there has been a steady erosion of free public space in the name of security, religion or social harmony. Nepal must avoid this at all costs. Historically, we have been perhaps the most tolerant society in South Asia, with the kind of religious and sectarian strife seen in other parts of the region rarely seen here. What has certainly increased by leaps and bounds is the online trolling of top political leaders and expressions of scepticism of all things associated with the government. But those in the government, instead of introspecting about why they have become so unpopular, seem rather intent on stifling the medium for the dissemination of their misdeeds and misgovernance. They should realise that often what transpires online is only a symptom of an underlying malady. It would be foolish to try to treat the symptom while ignoring the disease. \nIt has been five months since the Nepali Congress and the CPN-UML formed a coalition government on July 15 by stepping on the seven-point deal inked on July 1. How is the coalition of the two biggest political parties faring? The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal sat down with Krishna Khanal, a professor of political science, for his insights.How do you evaluate the performance of the Congress-UML government based on the pledges they made at the time of coalition formation?Two biggest parties getting together to form a government is a bit unusual in the system we have adopted. The strength of the system is that the government can be made accountable by a strong opposition. But when the two biggest parties join hands to run the government, the opposition in the House becomes weak. This is a concern. The Congress and the UML have had joint governments in critical junctures in the past. Now, there is no extraordinary situation requiring them to forge a coalition but they justified it saying it would end political instability. Their argument was that unreasonable bargaining of smaller parties made the prime ministers weak. That’s partially true. However, the crux of the matter is that they wanted to enjoy consolidated power. KP Oli wanted to be prime minister and the Congress leaders who were out of power wanted to return to Singha Durbar. So they signed the seven-point deal with the pledge of amending the constitution.Has this coalition been a success? What are the initial indications?There are certain curious things. The seven-point agreement doesn’t say the UML will hand over government leadership to the Congress in the second phase of their partnership. It says, after two years, UML chair Oli will hand it over to Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba. It shows how our parties have become leader-centric instead of institution-centric. After all, Oli and Deuba are the chiefs and parliamentary leaders of their respective parties and they are the ones who will lead the government. Still they wished to specifically mention their names, which indicates they still feel insecure. Likewise, Prime Minister Oli says that he is handing over power to Deuba in July 2026. Recently he said he is handing it over after 18 months. Despite there being a written agreement, he keeps repeating the timeline. This suggests mutual mistrust due to past records of betrayal. It is true that the Congress and the UML together have a strong majority in the House and, with the backing of a few other smaller forces, they can manage two-thirds majority needed to amend the constitution. But when it comes to political issues, even the small parties in the coalition are hardly on the same page. So numerical strength alone won’t work. Hence there has been no progress on constitution amendment in the past five months. These pledges were made just to create a pretext to get to power.Is the present government any different to the erstwhile Dahal-led coalition, particularly on delivery?No. In the seven-point agreement, they pledged to improve the ailing economy. We don’t find any reform and the economy is still stagnant. I can’t recall a single thing this government has done that is worth appreciating. The only thing this coalition has achieved is ending unusual power manoeuverings by Prachanda [Maoist Centre chair Pushpa Kamal Dahal]. The way Dahal was switching alliance partners between the Congress and the UML was unnatural. The present coalition ended the trend, at least for now. Also, some unhealthy activities taking place in provinces have been stopped. But the government has utterly failed to provide any relief to the people. What about the process of amending the constitution?The Congress and the UML leaders have often blamed the proportional representation (PR) electoral system for the country’s political instability. The UML proposed to limit the scope of the PR system to the National Assembly and some Congress leaders have also floated this idea. After the formation of this government, many people assumed that this coalition may take some action to implement those propositions. But doing so is not easy. Despite a strong majority in the House, the Congress and the UML alone can’t amend the constitution. Other small parties won’t support them to water down the PR system. The top leaders are conspicuously silent as they know diverse issues are going to open up once they start the process. For instance, the Rastriya Prajatantra Party wants to revive Hindu monarchy and the Madhes-based parties have their own grievances. Moreover, if you analyse the election results since 2008, it’s not difficult to infer that not only small parties but even the major forces will think twice before making any changes to the PR system. Be it big or small, old or new parties, all have gotten a significant number of seats under the PR category. In the first Constituent Assembly election in 2008, the Congress and the UML were in crisis. It was the PR system that saved them from being pushed into an existential crisis. Besides that, there is one big political reason behind the adoption of this electoral system and that is to ensure representation of various underprivileged communities in state organs. We can’t forget that context. Hence the Congress and UML leaders have been silent on the constitution amendment in the past couple of months.Is there any need to review or amend the constitution?There is a need to seriously review and analyse the problems faced in the course of implementing the constitution in the past nine years. For instance, the vice-president has no role. He can be made ex-officio chair of the National Assembly, as in India. Then, the state doesn’t need to elect the upper house chair. This option was discussed during constitution writing as well. Recently, we conducted by-polls to fill the vacant positions of chiefs of local units. These polls were unnecessary as there can be a provision to entrust the deputy chiefs with the responsibility of carrying out the chief’s duties when the position goes vacant. There is a need for a comprehensive review and changes in some provisions based on the practical experience of statute implementation. But there are different parties and groups that want to raise different political agendas. For instance, some want a more powerful federal system while others want to scrap the system and revive Hindu monarchy. How should we review the national charter and what kind of mechanism will be right for that?The best way is through a review commission composed of politicians and subject experts. But leaders don’t trust independent experts who don’t follow their instructions. Forming a body of experts loyal to the leaders is meaningless. Therefore, a special parliamentary committee can be entrusted with this task. The panel will be composed of members from political parties based on their strength in the House. The parties and other stakeholders can submit their formal proposals to the committee and the experts can give their inputs to the same panel. The body can help give shape to the ongoing debates and discussions will take place in a more organised and formal way. It can conduct a thorough study of the complications seen in the course of constitution implementation. My emphasis is not on amending the constitution on political grounds but from the perspectives of removing difficulties experienced in the course of implementation. For instance, provinces have failed to prove their relevance. Now, we need to study where the problems are. But I don’t think the political parties are going to work on this issue with the seriousness it deserves. Leaders, of late, have proposed to increase the threshold to secure seats under the PR category, which can be done by amending election laws. They have floated the idea of increasing the PR threshold to five percent. [At present, it is three percent at the federal and 1.5 percent at the provincial level]. If it is increased to five percent, hardly four or five political parties may qualify for the PR seats. So this is not an appropriate proposal. To ensure political stability, we have to instead develop a system supportive of a coalition culture. The problem lies in our leaders and not in the constitution. For instance, why did Prachanda switch alliances multiple times after the last election? There is no point in blaming the system for instability. To discuss and debate all these issues, we need a review body.What is your analysis of the recent local by-polls results?The voting pattern shows that the big parties couldn’t increase their vote shares and failed to attract voters. The Congress lost more seats in comparison to the last by-polls. The UML had mixed results while the Maoist Centre made some gains. As it fought single-handedly this time, the Congress lost some seats that it had won with the support of alliance partners last time. This is natural. The Maoist Centre appears to have benefitted by being in the opposition and as it concentrated its strengths in select areas for the past few months. Party chief Dahal himself visited some remote local units. The Congress doesn’t appear serious about reviewing its poor performance while the UML has decided to study the matter and find what went wrong. The Maoist leaders look excited but the party has not made much progress in popular votes. There are assumptions of some informal collaborations between the Maoist Centre and the Rastriya Swatantra Party. The way Dahal has defended Rabi Lamichhane in recent days backs the assumption.Why do you think the performance of new forces including the RSP and Janamat were poor in the by-polls?My assumption is that voters rethought the need to change the party of their choice if the main objective of the leaders from new parties is to be ministers. RSP chief Rabi Lamichhane insisted on becoming home minister. In the meantime, recent investigations have shown his linkages to cooperative scams. People might have thought that he is not a clean person. These factors might have played a role. Last time, people supported new forces not to make their leaders ministers but for political reforms. The chief minister from Janamat Party who is leading the provincial government in Madhesh formed a 20-member Cabinet, which is the biggest ever there. He downsized it only after severe criticism. Such developments certainly play a role in elections. These are just assumptions. We can’t jump to conclusions but it is safe to say that Nepali voters are consistently trying to find better alternatives.While there were reports of former President Bidya Devi Bhandari rejoining the UML to return to active politics, former Vice-President Nanda Bahadur Pun is most likely to join the Maoist Centre. What kind of precedent will this set?I don’t see serious problems in former vice-presidents rejoining active politics as they don’t play any vital role as vice-presidents. But the issue of former Presidents returning to active politics is serious as such a precedent will invite serious anomalies. Though the constitution and laws don't bar former presidents from making such a comeback, politics should be guided by certain values, principles and convictions. Bhandari’s return to active politics will be unfortunate. It should be stopped. \nPrime Minister KP Sharma Oli returned home on December 5 after a four-day official visit to China. During the visit, the two countries signed the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) Framework Cooperation agreement. The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal sat down with Bishnu Rimal, chief advisor to the prime minister, who was one of the key interlocutors during the framework agreement negotiations, for insights on how the deals were finalised between the two countries.There are many queries about the details of the agreements signed between Nepal and China last week. Please tell us about the key points.Nepal and China had been exchanging documents related to the Belt and Road Initiative of China since 2020, under the BRI implementation plan. While signing any agreement, the two countries engage in rigorous negotiations and at times it takes a long time even to finalise a word. This time, we signed a framework agreement, which is like a basket, where we have put many things. It’s different from a memorandum of understanding (MoU). In the agreement, we have described its background, principles, objectives, the modality of mobilising financial resources and implementing mechanisms. Even the previous government led by Pushpa Kamal Dahal had planned to finalise it but it didn’t in the end. Now we have taken it ahead. The new agreement should be understood in a context. In 2016, we were in government [during Oli’s first tenure] and we visited Beijing. At the time, China was supporting Nepal through the Trans-Himalayan Multi-Dimensional Connectivity Network (THMDCN) package. Later, the support was provided through the BRI and the THMDCN became a part of it. Nepal reached an MoU to this effect in 2017. After that, an implementation plan needed to be signed. Following the formation of the present government, we held discussions on this. The two major coalition partners—the Nepali Congress and the CPN-UML—formed a four-member team for this specific purpose. Party general secretary Gagan Thapa and lawyer Semanta Dahal from the Nepali Congress and Yubaraj Khatiwada ji and myself from the UML were in the team. In the past, we have reached several agreements with China, India, the United States, Japan and various other countries and sought support from them. But we haven’t been able to properly utilise the support. Our [taskforce’s] focus was to ensure best use of the pledged amount and implement the agreements. At first, we studied the documents exchanged after 2020. At the beginning we forged consensus between the UML and the Congress and then shared the document with the Chinese side because it can only be implemented after it is acceptable for both sides. This time, we wanted to take the implementation process ahead because Nepal joined the BRI process years ago. Nepal has already joined China’s Global Development Initiative, which is an international development concept. But there were some confusions about our participation in development projects under the BRI. There needed to be more clarity on our side. At times, it has been dragged into controversy. We wanted to dispel rumours and confusions.First of all we all should know that the BRI is a framework and the agreement we signed is a basket deal. Later, we will select specific projects and negotiate on particular details and conditions. In fact, the debate ahead of the prime minister’s visit was driven by whether to take loans or grants from China. That was wrong. It is rather a project-based approach. On certain projects, we need all grants while on certain others, we may jointly develop them. Still in other projects, we have to seek concessional loans. All these things depend on what project we are talking about. If a project can pay back the loan, that could be dealt accordingly. But our discussions were driven by the concept of loan versus grant. Even top leaders got swayed by such narratives and reacted accordingly. China has declared huge grants to Nepal multiple times since 2016. But we haven’t been able to use them as we have to earmark the amounts and seek them. First, we have to say that we are going to use this money in these projects. We at the task force concluded that the amount of the grants pledged by China is enough for us for now. There is no need to take out a loan now. Our priority is to get the grants that have been stuck for years. Do we need to select certain projects for that?Yes, we have to first finalise the projects and prepare business plans. We can explore other options only if the grant money is insufficient for a particular project. For instance, if we start working on a cross-border railway, we would discuss whether the grant money is sufficient and whether to seek more grants or go for loans. We aren’t in that stage now. We are yet to receive the grant announced during the visit of Chinese President Xi Jinping in 2019. Similarly, grants were announced during the China visits of then President Bidya Devi Bhandari, first President Rambaran Yadav and our prime minister KP Sharma Oli. Also, this time, the Chinese President has announced 500 million RMB in assistance. So, again, first we have to work to receive and use the grant money. For instance, recently, the Chinese side announced to provide electric vehicles worth US$10 million as support through the Chinese embassy. The EVs include public buses, ambulances and school vans but they release them only after we provide the specifications of the vehicles that we need. The amount we sign as a budgetary support can be used wherever we want but other sums are released only after we earmark them for certain projects. After a long negotiation, Nepal and China have agreed on the term ‘aid assistance financing’. What does that mean?During the negotiation, we had used the term ‘grant and different financing modalities’. Later, we agreed to replace the word ‘grant’ with ‘aid’. We did so as we wanted to keep the door open in terms of seeking support from a country. If we say that we won’t receive any support except grants, it creates complications in the overall investment scenario. The Chinese government may provide a certain amount of grant to the government of Nepal but it doesn’t give it to the private sector.If Nepal’s private sector plans to attract investment from China, the World Bank, the ADB or any other agencies, for example for a mega hydro project, they may not get it as the Chinese side knows that Nepal accepts only grants and no other form of investment. Such a condition creates complications as this agreement is applicable even for the private sector. Therefore, we didn’t want to close the door. We can’t say we accept loans from this country but not from the other. We accept assistance that serves our national interest.Will the negotiations now onward be project-specific then?Yes. It will be project and proposal specific. Such issues will be negotiated only when we discuss a certain project. Therefore, the ongoing debate over grants versus loan is pointless. For instance, we didn’t receive certain portions of the assistance announced by India immediately after the 2015 earthquakes. Such is also the case with China and with other countries on occasions as the conditions attached to them weren’t acceptable to us.After the failure in operating Pokhara Regional International Airport due to lack of business plans, people are now suspicious about the utilisation of any assistance fruitfully.How can you say the Pokhara airport project is a failure? First, one should study the airport’s capacity and check how many passengers are flying to Pokhara now. A good number of people are flying there. I think the interest rate on the loan we took from China to build the airport is no different to the rate we receive from the World Bank, the IMF and other multilateral agencies. We can debate whether we have been able to operate the airport in its full capacity. But there is no need to scandalise it unnecessarily.Ahead of the prime minister’s visit, there were voices that Nepal should seek a waiver of Pokhara airport loan from China. What happened?Let me ask you a question. Imagine, you took a loan from Rastriya Banijya Bank to meet your needs. Say, there is a government led by a leader who favours you. Can the prime minister waive off your bank loan? No. You have to follow the system. So your question is wrong. The Pokhara airport deal is not a grant. It’s a commercial deal. Those who run the government can’t use the language of Durga Prasai, who threatens not to pay back bank loans. What are the agreements on road connectivity and cross-border railway projects?We have included five points under the infrastructure-urban development project. These are Tokha-Chhahare Tunnel, Hilsa Simkot Road Project, Kathmandu-Khandbari Road, Kimathanka Bridge, the cross-border railway project from Rasuwagadhi to Kathmandu and the Amargadhi City Hall. Likewise, we have included a cross-border transmission line to start energy trade with China. Under education and health, we agreed to establish universities and colleges. The Chinese side is carrying out a feasibility study of the railway project with a plan to complete it by 2026. Once the study is complete, we will discuss the funding modalities and business plans.What is the status of the Tokha-Chhahare tunnel project?The China side is in a position to complete its feasibility study. After that, construction work will start.Nepal has signed so many agreements with China. While we have progressed a lot on paper, there is little progress on the ground. Will the present agreement make any substantive change in this connection?Nepal is behind on monitoring and follow up. We should have formed bilateral mechanisms and monitored work progress. Now, there is a sense of urgency in the government to expedite development works. An inter-agency mechanism will be formed within our government. It will monitor and facilitate the work and the line ministries will execute the plans.Why are the agreements signed with China not made public, unlike the deals inked with other countries?There is no problem in making them public because there is nothing to hide. But all agreements aren’t made public. The MCC Compact had to be taken to the parliament as people were divided over it. Then, it was publicly debated. Likewise, people are now expressing their curiosity towards the BRI documents. But there are many projects people don’t care about. When needed, the documents can be made public as nothing can be hidden these days. And there is nothing wrong in making them public.UMl’s coalition partner Congress was reportedly reluctant to sign the framework agreement. What was its concern?That is a wrong narrative. Both the UML and the Congress were on the same page. It was possible to conclude the agreements because we had consensus.But the Congress leaders expressed their concerns in public ahead of the visit and even after the signing of the deals.We have to follow the party’s official decisions, not the statements of individual leaders. How would it have been possible to reach agreements if there were differences in the two-party taskforce, in the leadership and the party’s official positions? It’s a Nepal-China agreement jointly done by the UML and the Congress, and backed by all other parties. The prime minister convened a meeting of former prime ministers and foreign ministers ahead of his visit. All of them advised the prime minister to sign the agreement with China. Why was the signing of the agreement delayed?While signing a bilateral agreement, we can’t think only from our perspective. Negotiation always takes long. The joint statement has stated that the two sides are ready to sign the BRI framework as soon as possible. It took time for us to share the documents with the Chinese side after we reached Beijing. It’s not like two leaders just sit, discuss and sign on that. They have to consult concerned ministries, departments and officials. The Chinese worked overnight after we submitted the documents. My impression is that the Chinese side showed magnanimity and adopted a short-cut approach and signed on the deals. They were ready to sign the agreements on our conditions. That was a wonderful gesture.What were the specific points of contention and how were they resolved?We substantially edited the documents that were exchanged in the past, making them more specific and converting them into a framework of cooperation. Therefore, the Chinese side needed at least a day to study them. They argued that it would work even without mentioning the word ‘grant’. In view of the narratives in Nepal, we proposed to use ‘grant’ or a word with similar meaning. Then, we proposed ‘aid assistance financing’, and they accepted the term.How will the new deal be implemented?There used to be confusion about whether a certain project is under the BRI. China said even the Pokhara airport project is under the BRI while we said it was initiated before that. Now onward, all projects with China will be under the BRI cooperation. All the financing and investments from China will enter Nepal through the BRI window. We will prioritise the projects already proposed and under study such as the railway project, Tokha-Chhahare tunnel, and Madan Bhandari University. We have agreed to strengthen connectivity on border points and work will be expedited there. That will help transform Nepal from a land-locked into a land-linked country.Why are the projects being developed with Chinese involvement so slow?These days the Chinese side tells us to give projects only after clearing the sites. For instance, the 17-km Syafrubeshi-Rasuwagadhi road is to be built by Chinese grants. There is one transmission pole standing in the way. We are yet to remove it from the construction site. They haven’t started the work citing the same reason. Creating an environment to work on the field is our responsibility. It’s not that only China-built projects are slow. Such is also the story with our projects with other countries and agencies. Even in the case of the MCC projects, it took a long time to finalise many issues. We are too slow in implementing agreements and executing projects. First, we have to do some retrospection and improve our efficiency.  \nWang Peng, a research fellow from the Institute of State Governance at Huazhong University, Wuhan, was previously Deputy Secretary-General of the National Academy of Belt and Road Green Development (NABRGD) Beijing. Peng, a keen observer of South Asian geopolitics, was recently in Kathmandu to participate in ‘Kantipur Conclave-2024’. He sat down with the Post’s Purushottam Poudel and Kantipur’s Jagdishor Panday to discuss a host of issues. Excerpt:How have Nepal-China relations evolved in recent times? Generally, bilateral ties between Nepal and China have been stable. Politically, China’s Nepal policy has been stable too. Even though the administration in Nepal has changed, Kathmandu still has a stable and friendly policy towards China. Relations are progressing steadily. But we still have room for progress. Nepal’s Prime Minister is visiting China in the first week of December. This is a perfect opportunity for the Nepali and Chinese governments to enhance mutual understanding and political trust. Face-to-face meetings between the leaders of two countries are crucial. Due to the Himalayas, many Chinese people, including me, consider Nepal a country far away. But actually, we are alongside each other, not far. Nepal is an hour’s distance from Lasha and a few hours from Chengdu, which is very close. Despite being a close neighbour, China is often accused of not investing enough in Nepal, at least as compared to its other neighbours. Why is this so? There is no need to compare countries as every country has its own conditions. China’s investment in Nepal is significant, especially considering Nepal’s current economic size, population, and capability to use foreign capital effectively. We may talk about the cooperation between China and Pakistan, with the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) as a flagship BRI program. China indeed has a massive investment in Pakistan. China has good relations with Pakistan for many reasons, one of them being that Pakistani politicians usually do not play the so-called “China card”. Despite political changes in Pakistan, relations between Beijing and Islamabad are seldom harmed. China is equal to every partner within the BRI framework, so the key variable essentially is the local leaders’ political choices and their ability to build consensus in domestic politics.What are you trying to suggest when you say Pakistan does not play China card? Many Chinese International Relations scholars, including me, appreciate Pakistan. What we appreciate about Pakistan is that despite their internal political differences, there is a bottom line that none of them uses China as a card. Because of this, Chinese companies dare to invest in Pakistan. This is good—good for these companies and good for the local guys—and this has created more than 10,000 jobs for the local guys over the past few years. In this way, China and Pakistan have accumulated a high level of strategic trust. Non-intervention has been the fundamental principle of Chinese foreign policy. In most developing countries, the government often changes. The country’s people can change the government if they think it has done no good to the citizens. We only hope that politicians do not use China as weapons when fighting for power. So the goal should be to devise a win-win plan to benefit both sides. You mentioned China’s investment preferences abroad. But don’t you think that the investment decisions of a democratic government and an undemocratic one like China will be different? China is a democratic country. People say that China is not a democratic country since it does not have an election. But the Chinese leaders are under intense pressure to think about history. The Chinese government and the leaders should work for the benefit of all the citizens of the country, not just for their supporters. For example, Donald Trump doesn’t need to serve all American people. Even if he supports the people who supported him during the election, his work is done. However, in China, this is not the case. The Chinese government should reconcile different peoples and encourage joint development of the country. A country like China, which is big both in terms of people and land mass, will split if the government does not tread cautiously. That’s China’s nightmare. We have suffered many tragedies in history, so we don’t want this kind of thing to happen again. The Chinese Communist Party, government and high-ranking leaders believe in history. That is why they try to create or design five-year institutions, projects, and reform plans.For example, the Chinese still celebrate Deng Xiaoping’s legacy. Despite being the leader who was not elected, did Deng use power arbitrarily? No. He prudently used his power to ensure that even 50 years down the lane, the country’s people remember him as a leader who greatly benefitted them. Other Chinese political leaders have also taken responsibility for all Chinese people and have made significant reforms to create an environment for business, and for investment in new technology, such as AI and space technology. How do you assess China’s relationship with South Asian countries in general? We should not indulge in conflict. We need resolution and reconciliation with India in the border conflict. All the neighbouring countries, including Nepal, have no border conflict. Apart from India and Bhutan, China has no border conflict with our neighbouring countries. Bhutan is happy to sign a border contract with China, but maybe they are waiting for the message from New Delhi. China will not exert any pressure. It is reasonable for China to be silent about other countries’ internal affairs. Sometimes, the decisions of neighbouring countries are not suitable for China’s interests, but China often keeps quiet and waits for good things to happen. We don’t have any land ambition in our neighbouring countries; we have enough land. If so, why is there conflict in the South China Sea? We don’t have land ambition, so we don’t want an inch of land from other countries. At the same time, we are determined not to abandon an inch of our land.If you look at the United Nations P-5 countries, which are permanent security council members, China is the most prudent country in which decisions are not made by weapons. In South Asia, China-India relations have again started to improve. It's a good beginning. China's relations with other South Asian countries, including Nepal, are stable. China and India are ancient civilisations. We have enough power to solve our problems together. We don’t need a third party’s long hand. We don’t need this kind of teaching. We are brothers; if we have problems, we can solve them together. The best way to resolve the problem between China and India is to develop mutual political trust, security resolution, and economic cooperation, which I believe will happen. Thanks to the potential threat from Donald Trump’s reelection, the two leaders of China and India have used their political wisdom to make changes in advance and create a better atmosphere for the future. Apart from security, what are China’s other concerns in Nepal?The bottom line in China’s foreign policy with neighbouring countries is peace and stability. If you read the Chinese line, we admire mutual respect. We desire friendly countries to commit to ‘One China’. Second, China would also like to promote economic cooperation with Nepal. Not only with Nepal but also with all countries. We want a simple process of import and export, a good business environment, and transparency in law and policy. If the above-mentioned things are achieved, Chinese companies will dare to increase their investment [in Nepal]. Nepal has long been an adamant supporter of ‘One China policy’. But now it has also committed to uphold ‘One China principle’? What does this shift entail for Nepal?To be precise, there is no difference. China’s bottom line is principle; for our friends, that’s policy. If they accept the One China principle, they will conduct a One China policy, which means they will not develop official contact with Taiwan. Earlier in Nepal, there used to be a discourse that Nepal could be a bridge between India and China, but you have come up with a larger perspective that Nepal could not only be a door to South Asia but also to East Asia. Can you elaborate?We don’t say Nepal or any other country should do this or that. We say we expect something. Frankly, China and India are both robust in population, land mass, and economies. Additionally, India is a young country. China also has its own advantage. Nepal has been blocked geographically by these two countries. But Nepal can potentially be the hub, not limited to the periphery. At least in the next three decades, both China and India can offer the most attractive economic opportunities in the world. If Nepal treads cautiously, it can enjoy the benefit of its location. Geography is constant, but political geography is variable and changes.If China and India go against each other, it might be a nightmare for the Nepali people. But, if China-India come together, even if not like in the 1950s, to make a rational decision not to let the border conflict escalate and promote trade, Nepal can enjoy its location as the intermediary rather than as a bridge. Rather than a bridge, Nepal should be a port. In this way, Nepal can earn a lot with China and India because both countries should get permission from Nepal to use its ports to export and import the goods they want. Bring goods from China’s Tibet Autonomous Region to Nepal and then transit to India. Bring goods from Indian cities to Nepal and transit to China via Tibet Autonomous Region. It is a very short distance, and much better. China is never envious of Nepal and India’s bilateral ties. We will never put sand in the wheels of Kathmandu-New Delhi relations. We know you are friends. But don’t make the friendship exclusive; it should be inclusive.You mentioned that China does not meddle in the internal affairs of other countries. But China has tried to bring communist parties in Nepal together and has been holding ideological discussions with these parties. Isn’t this selective engagement a form of meddling?First, one should know that in China, “international affairs” (among the governments of sovereign countries) are handled by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (中华人民共和国外交部) under the central government, the same as in other countries. At the same time, “inter-party affairs” (between the CPC and all other friendly parties in the world) are handled by the International Department, Central Committee of CPC (中共中央对外联络部) within the Party system.The mission of both the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the International Department of the CPC Central Committee is to promote mutual understanding, friendship and cooperation between the Chinese government, the Communist Party of China and the Chinese people and governments, political parties and peoples of other countries, but the division of labor between the two is slightly different. There are some misreadings and misunderstandings.First, it said that the International Department of the CPC only communicates with communist or left-wing parties. That is wrong. In fact, the International Department speaks on behalf of the Communist Party of China and all political parties around the world that are friendly to China, including both the ruling and opposition parties.Second, it said that the International Department had contacts with opposition parties in other countries. This statement is also wrong. The International Department and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs have their own priorities. The ministry and the government agencies carry out diplomatic activities and naturally deal with the ruling parties of other countries.However, the International Department of the CPC Central Committee conducts exchanges with all political parties that are friendly to China, in line with international norms and practices. Everything is above board and conducive to mutual understanding, mutual trust and win-win cooperation between the two governments, two parties and two peoples.“Non-intervention in internal affairs” (不干涉他国内政) and “foreign affairs are not defined by ideology” (不以意识形态划线) are two major principles of the CPC and the Chinese government.As Sun Yeli, spokesman for the 20th National Congress of the Communist Party of China (CPC) said on October 15, 2022, the CPC maintains different forms of contacts with more than 600 political parties and organisations in more than 170 countries, and the international circle of friends is growing.“The more friends, the better.” As Sun Yeli said, for a long time, and on the basis of the principles of independence, complete equality, mutual respect and non-interference in each other's internal affairs, the Communist Party of China has had extensive exchanges with friendly political parties and political forces of other countries, and its international circle of friends has been growing.In recent years, China has hosted the World Political Party Leaders Summit and high-level Dialogue, attended by more than 500 leaders of political parties and organisations from over 160 countries and more than 10,000 political party representatives. The development of political party relations has driven and promoted the development of state-to-state relations and enhanced the understanding and friendship between the peoples.Sun Yeli said the CPC attaches importance to exchanges with Marxist political parties in other countries. Through theoretical exchanges and policy dialogue, they jointly explore the path of socialist development suitable for their respective national conditions and explore their respective paths to realise the localisation of Marxism.“The CPC's foreign affairs are not defined by ideology,” Sun said, adding that the CPC is willing to make friends with all kinds of political parties of all countries, irrespective of the ideology they uphold, as long as they are friendly to China and willing to conduct exchanges with the CPC.How is China seeing Nepal’s Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli’s Beijing visit, which will commence on December 2? Nepal’s prime minister, especially from the communist parties, often visits China. Big promises and agreements are made during the visits, but they seldom materialise. How hopeful is China about Prime Minister Oli’s visit this time?I am not a foreign ministry official. So I cannot represent the Chinese government. Over the past decade, China-Nepal relations have made remarkable progress. Political mutual trust between the two sides has steadily increased, and economic cooperation has yielded initial results. There is an old saying in China, “haste makes waste.” In other words, whether it is to develop bilateral relations or the economy through economic and trade cooperation, these things must conform to the objective economic conditions and cannot be rushed. Steady improvement and steady progress are the best. \nFormer Indian chief election commissioner SY Quraishi is a strong advocate of credible elections and inclusive democracy. He has extensively spoken and written on how increasing flow of money in elections is taking away the level playing field for candidates from different backgrounds. During his recent visit to Kathmandu, Binod Ghimire of the Post and Suresh Raj Neupane and Rajesh Mishra of Kantipur talked to him on a range of issues from electoral reforms, challenges in maintaining election sanctity in the age of generative artificial intelligence, to why the world is swinging right. Excerpts:Elections and democracy are intertwined. However, recent election results the world over are being seen as a threat to law and democracy. How do you see this phenomenon?Democracy and elections are two sides of the same coin. Without elections, there is no democracy. And worldwide, for the past 10 years, there is a swing towards the right, even in the US. In India, of course, we have been on the right for the past 10 years and our prime minister got a third term, though with a bit of reduced majority.The other thing is that in the past 10-12 years, there has been a debate on whether democracy is on a decline worldwide. The fact is that several indices of democracy indicate the decline. But people’s will cannot be taken as a threat to democracy. Sometimes they go to the left, sometimes, they move to the right. We cannot call it a threat to democracy. The democracy indices which I mentioned have a different classification.First, there are full democracies. Then there are flawed democracies. Third is hybrid democracies. The fourth is an authoritarian regime. So even in South Asia, we have one or two countries which are authoritarian, like Afghanistan and Pakistan. Their ranking keeps going up or down depending on the electoral and democratic performance. In India, the right-wing is ruling, but they lost some majority. They are now depending on two other parties, which are not considered right-wing. Of course, Trump got an absolute majority this time winning both popular vote and electoral votes. He also won both the houses. So, this is what can make him dictatorial. As it is, he is mercurial, and everybody is speculating how he is going to behave. Let’s wait and see.We can agree that people cannot be taken as a threat to democracy. But can we say that the elections, rather than complementing the spirit of democracy, are turning into tools to endorse majoritarianism?Well, people’s will is supreme. If they have chosen absolute governments, if they have given large majorities, you cannot blame the people. Many times a lot of money is being used in elections, and only the rich people get to win elections. In India, for instance, 93 percent of MPs who got elected are crorepatis [multi-millionaires]. Now, law provides for a ceiling on expenditure, so that level playing field is established, where you and I can also contest.But then, the ceiling on expenditure in India has one flaw—it is only for candidates, not political parties. This negates or neutralises the purpose of the ceiling. You can’t spend more than 1 crore, but your party can spend 20 crores on you. So where is the level playing field? Some people say there should be state funding of elections. I oppose the idea but recommend state funding of political parties. It is difficult to monitor election expenditure because of black money. Funding political parties with cheques is what I recommend because it is easy to monitor. So you think election management is more of a problem than the electoral system?Actually, both are important, because obviously the management follows what the system prescribes. There are laws, there are rules, and they have to be followed. For instance, on political funding, there is a cap on expenditure provided by law, and the election management body implements it. Therefore, we have to improve both. Both are equally important. We say public consciousness has increased with time, but there are also concerns that people are picking right-wing leaders. So what is wrong?Actually, it’s a good question but difficult to answer. Why is it that the whole world is turning right? But there are also states like Austria where everybody was thinking the extreme right was winning, but then liberals won. So, there are exceptions. Maybe people want a strong and stable government, which has the benefit of continuity. On the other hand, such a government can be accused of majoritarianism.I heard your prime minister, Oli-ji, mentioning frequent government changes. Obviously, how can the government function with this kind of instability? On the other hand there is the prime minister of India who has been elected for the third term. It is the people's choice, and you can't fault the people. The people chose stability and a strong government, and we have to respect that.Are people not knowledgeable enough to pick the right representatives for themselves?This question is often raised. For instance, we were talking about crorepatis and criminals in politics. Almost 46 percent of MPs in India have criminal cases against them. When we talk to these MPs, they say, look, people are choosing us, so how can you blame us? That way the blame is passed on to the people.Why is the electorate choosing dishonest people against whom there are criminal cases? This debate leads us nowhere. So obviously there is something good these people with criminal background must be doing in the constituency. Maybe they commit crime outside the constituency and like Robin Hood, benefit their own people.Aam Aadmi Party was a new party, and won 67 out of 70 seats in Delhi. They managed funds through crowdfunding and volunteers. And they won hands down.What are the issues that have come up with the proliferation of social media and new media?Social media and new media have revolutionised communication. But, initially, when the election commission of India in 2012 or 2013 came out with some regulation, there was a lot of public criticism, which was unjustified. Social media is also media. So whatever applies to media will apply to social media. And in the election context, what applies to the media? Two things: How much money are you spending on buying space in the newspaper and how much money are you paying to the TV channel?Therefore, how much money are you paying to Facebook or WhatsApp, you have to account for it as well. The law on expenditure will apply to social media also. The second concern was how will the election commission catch the violators, as they are anonymous. The difficulty in catching them cannot be an excuse for not taking cognisance of their offence. If we cannot catch them today, tomorrow we will. How can something be illegal in a newspaper and legal on social media?Rumours always play a big role in elections. Social media has multiplied the problem a thousand times. Within two, three minutes, your country can be burned by false, fake news. Social media however has many benefits. For instance, instead of buying space in the newspaper and TV channel, through WhatsApp or Twitter you can reach your audience in two seconds flat.So social media is a double-edged weapon, as was the consensus in the Kantipur Conclave. And, you know, it is like a knife. Is a knife good or bad? If you want to cut an apple, it is good. If you want to cut a man’s throat, it is bad. It depends how you use it. Now, artificial intelligence has given rise to even deep fakes. But AI has benefits too. Through artificial intelligence, impersonation can be stopped. Voting and logistics can be monitored. But there is so much fraud, deep fakes, and hate. So how do you catch them? That is something we have to be wary about. Frankly, I am worried because its dangers outweigh the benefits. We have to put our heads together globally to make sure artificial intelligence doesn’t overtake human intelligence for destructive ends.In Nepal, both federal and provincial elections happen at once. India too is now mulling ‘one nation, one election’. What is your take on this?There are benefits and there are problems. Logistically, it makes sense. But one MP of Odisha posed this question: ask the people. What do they want? Poor people love frequent elections because this is the only way they can highlight their importance. Otherwise, how many times have we seen that posters are put up in a constituency with headings like ‘Missing’, or ‘Wanted’ [representatives]? Frequent elections make the representatives accountable.We heard you say that if India does ‘one nation, one election’, that will be the presidential election. What do you mean?During parliamentary elections, there are national and international issues. The issues are different in Parliament [national], Vidhan Sabha [state-level] and Panchayat [local]. I would like to say that the local body elections are as important, perhaps more important because they’re closer to the people.India’s prime minister initially said that there would be a national debate and a consensus would be reached. There was a debate for 10 years, but there was no consensus.If there was no consensus, the idea should have been dropped. But the government decided unilaterally that we will go ahead and set up a committee led by the former president of India to suggest ways to implement ‘one nation, one election’. In my articles I have questioned the propriety of a former president being drawn into a government committee.They have made some questionable recommendations. They say that simultaneous will mean Vidhan Sabha and Lok Sabha, not Panchayat. But the terms of reference clearly say that simultaneous means all three tiers. Then it says Panchayat elections can be held after 100 days. After 100 days, there is a separate election. It’s a new election and will require totally different arrangements. These are also not simultaneous elections.  \nNew Zealand all-rounder James Neesham is one of the biggest stars set to feature in the inaugural Nepal Premier League (NPL) T20 cricket tournament, scheduled from November 30 to December 21 at the TU Cricket Ground in Kirtipur, on the outskirts of the Kathmandu Valley. Neesham, 34, who has represented the Kiwis in 12 Tests, 76 ODIs, and 79 T20Is, scoring over 3,000 runs across all formats, will play for the Janakpur Bolts in this debut season of the NPL. Although Neesham hasn’t played Test cricket since 2016 and last featured in an ODI during the 2023 Cricket World Cup, he continues to be a prominent figure in franchise cricket globally. His impressive resume includes stints in the Indian Premier League with teams like Delhi Daredevils, Kings XI Punjab, Kolkata Knight Riders, Mumbai Indians and Rajasthan Royals, as well as appearances in the Vitality Blast, Bangladesh Premier League, SA20 of South Africa, The Hundred, Pakistan Super League, Big Bash League, Caribbean Premier League, and Champions League T20. Currently, he is playing for Ajman Bolts in the Abu Dhabi T10 League. Binod Pandey of Kantipur Daily, a sister publication of The Kathmandu Post, talked to Neesham through email about his upcoming participation in the NPL.

In the story cover all the events as much as possible, try to weave them together, making a beautiful story.\n    Be elaborative as possible. I need more text. Text only no title or headings. Write it in the form of inspiring story not news article or event.\n    \n    Story:\nOnce upon a time, nestled between the towering peaks of the Himalayas and the lush jungles of the Terai, there was a country named Nepal. Though still a developing nation, Nepal was a land of profound beauty and deep-rooted cultural heritage. The residents of Nepal faced many challenges, but beneath these hardships lay a resilient spirit and an unyielding hope for the future.\n\nThis enchanting land, where Mount Everest reaches towards the skies and the air carries a mix of incense and cool mountain breezes, was more than a geographical marvel. It was a mosaic of cultures, languages, and traditions, a testament to human endeavor against all odds. Nepal's history, from the unification under King Prithvi Narayan Shah to its transformation into a federal democratic republic, told a story of aspiration and endurance.\n\nIn recent years, the people of Nepal, with their indomitable will, had taken strides towards rebuilding and reimagining their country. They turned their struggles into stepping stones, each challenge a chapter in their ongoing saga. The shift from a monarchy to a republic had not only changed governance but had woven a new tapestry of democratic values and collective decision-making.\n\nEconomically, while agriculture continued to sustain a large part of its population, Nepal had begun to harness the potential of its picturesque landscapes, developing sustainable tourism that promised to preserve their natural heritage while boosting local economies. Communities living in the shadows of the Himalayas had become stewards of the earth, protecting the biodiversity that made their country unique.\n\nEach day brought new stories. Whether it was a festival in Kathmandu, a technological advance in Pokhara, or a conservation effort in Chitwan, these events were threads in the vibrant quilt of Nepali life. These stories, updated daily, reflected the pulse of progress and the spirit of hope that characterized this resilient nation.\n\nAnd so, as Nepal moved forward, each moment was not just a passage of time but a promise of potential, a narrative of a nation perennially climbing towards tomorrow, guided by the legacy of its past and the dreams of its future.\n\nNews events:\n\nWith a year to go before its 15th general convention, the race for the prize of the Nepali Congress president is starting to heat up. Senior party leader Shekhar Koirala has ‘unofficially’ kicked off his campaign to win the party’s coveted post from Sudurpaschim Province, traditionally a stronghold of party president Sher Bahadur Deuba. Starting the campaign in Deuba’s heartland and getting strong support of party leaders and cadres in the region means he wants to win Deuba's support too, said a Congress leader of the Koirala camp.Koriala, who lost the party president election to Deuba at the 14th general convention in December 2021, is contesting again. The two-term limit imposed by the party charter for the top post prevents Deuba from running again. The incumbent president has so far not disclosed who he will support as his successor. Another potential candidate is General Secretary Gagan Kumar Thapa, who has not officially declared his candidacy but has already activated his network and mechanism to win the support of party workers across the country.Koirala on Friday interacted with party leaders and cadres of nine districts in the Sudurpaschim Province and sought their support for his bid. He and other central members interacted for six hours with local party leaders in Dhangadhi and solicited their views, Govind Raj Pokahrel, who was with Koirala, told the Post. “We had excellent interactions, following rousing welcome from the party leaders and cadres alike in Dhangadhi,” Pokharel said.“You can call it an ‘unofficial’ launch of the campaign but the focus is also on putting pressure on the party leadership to hold the 15th general convention on time,” said Pokharel. “That is the central thrust of the meetings and interactions.”But the prospect of convening the 15th general convention in December 2025 is slim as the party encounters new complications in the distribution of active membership. Only active members can elect party leaders from the ward level. Those elected ward members later vote for the party’s representatives from all 165 electoral constituencies, who in turn vote for the new party leadership. “In order to complete the local conventions on time, we sent active membership application forms to the 165 constituencies as well as party chapters abroad but no constituency has completed its task,” a Congress office bearer said. “This could push back the general convention.” The Congress has formed a task force to look into issues related to the general convention. The general convention is likely to be deferred by a year due to a number of political and technical issues, said Congress lawmaker Ramhari Khatiwada. As per the Congress charter, the party can defer the general convention by a year citing unavoidable circumstances.According to party leaders, there is a big churn happening inside the Congress, with old factions and groups either dismantled or taking new shapes in light of the upcoming general convention. For instance, former foreign minister NP Saud, a longtime aide to Deuba, joined the Koirala faction.More leaders of the Deuba camp have also joined Koirala or Thapa factions. With Deuba out of the race, there is now a competition between Koirala and Thapa to pull leaders from the Deuba camp into their folds, said a Congress central committee member.Though Deuba has kept his cards close to his chest, many Congress leaders believe General Secretary Thapa is now making inroads into the Deuba camp. The two have been getting closer after CPN-UML chair KP Sharma Oli became the prime minister in July. “Deuba has so far refrained from fully supporting Thapa, Koirala or any other candidate,” said Khatiwada, chair of the federal parliament’s State Affairs Committee. There is also a chance of Deuba rooting for Dr Shashanka Koirala as next party president.“I will build a Nepali Congress suitable to the times we live in after the 15th general convention,” Shekhar Koirala said in Dhangadhi on Saturday. “In order to strengthen the party, I am ready to take over its leadership.” Koirala said the focus is on holding the general convention by December 2025 as stipulated in the charter, and there should be “no ifs and buts about this”. Soon after he lost the party presidency in 2021, Koirala started campaigning for the next convention, travelling across the country, meeting party cadres and most often playing the role of the party’s “opposition” leader. Congress central working committee member Ajaya Babu Shiwakoti, who is close to Gagan Thapa, said Thapa is busy handling the mechanism formed by the ruling Nepali Congress and the CPN-UML to make the government’s work effective, as well as with the party’s internal works, “which is why he appears slow in preparing for the next convention”. “But he [Thapa] is constantly in touch with party leaders and cadres across the country,” said Shiwakoti. “Also, there have been no serious talks between Koirala and Thapa on who will contest the post of party president.” Thapa contested and won the general secretary position from the Koirala camp at the last convention. While Koirala lost the top post, Thapa won with a wide margin of votes.There is a section of leaders in the Koirala-Thapa camp who still believe the two leaders should come together and contest the elections in consensus so that the camp can win a maximum number of seats in the Congress central working committee and other bodies of the party. \nAround four dozen Tribhuvan University teachers who went abroad on study leave have not returned, flouting the university law.Following the publication of a media report that said the opportunity to study abroad was being misused, the TU had sought data from its different departments. The Centre for Investigative Journalism reported that the country’s oldest varsity doesn’t have a proper record of its teachers who have gone abroad on paid ‘study leaves’ and whether they have returned after completing their study abroad.On December 8, the university’s Coordination Division had directed all of its constituent colleges, institutes and agencies concerned to report about such teachers. “As of now, we have received the information that at least 42 teaching staff who have travelled abroad for study haven’t returned, flouting existing laws,” Deepak Tiwari, the Division’s acting chief, told the Post. “It will take some days for us to prepare the detailed report.”The university allows its teachers—mainly the lecturers and assistant professors—to study abroad for their capability enhancement. Any teacher who has taught for five years after permanent posting is eligible to get paid study leave for three to five years.While lecturers themselves find the universities of their choice for the study, there are also the opportunities allocated for the teachers from the TU. Most of such study abroad opportunities the Nepali teachers get are scholarships, mainly for the Mphil or PhD programme.The university’s ‘Teacher Staff Service Rules-1994’ has specific provisions about the eligibility for such opportunities. Its clause 30 states that teachers who have used their study leave for five years must return to service and serve for at least five years. One using three years of leave has to be in the classrooms for the same period after the completion of their study abroad.The teachers wanting to get paid leave for study abroad must sign a bond with the coordination division in line with the TU staff rules. They also need to present a witness while signing the bond based on the service rules.The rule’s clause 84 states that if a teacher doesn’t attend the office for 90 days, the university can sack them. However, there are minimal cases where such teachers have been sacked.So much so that, in several cases, the teachers who have been staying abroad have been receiving the salary from the university. The university administration says they will fully implement the law once all the data of the defiant teachers is available.The report of the University Grants Commission states that as many as 8,122 teachers are associated with the oldest university. Of them 689 are professors, 2,199 are associate professors, 4,124 lectures, 984 assistant lectures and 126 are instructors.Among universities, the TU receives the highest budget from the government. Of the total Rs17.46 billion for the university education, the oldest and the largest university ‘s receives Rs12.26 billion. \nMina Karki from Dekuldanda in Ribdikot rural municipality, Palpa, has been engaged in beekeeping for 30 years. But recently, with the rising use of pesticides in commercial farming, she has been facing the problem. Bees are dying or fleeing.Most farmers are worried because honeybees are crucial to the food supply, pollinating over 100 crops. Reports say that three-fourths of the world's flowering plants and about 35 percent of the world's food crops depend on animal pollinators to reproduce. Karki, who has been doing beekeeping with the support of her husband, has more than 25 hives. She earns Rs60,000 annually and is motivated to earn while staying at home.“But dying bees have troubled many people like me,” said Karki. “I’ve been in the beekeeping business for three decades. This problem was rare.”Hom Bahadur Bhattarai of Bhairavsthan of Ribdikot has at least 35 hives. He has seen bees flying away. The hives have shrunk due to deaths as well.The Bhattarai couple said the problem became severe in the past couple of years. After generating a good income, Bhattarai added hives. He extracts honey three times a year. He assumed that the haphazard use of pesticides in vegetable and chilli farming has started impacting beekeeping.Nara Bahadur Palli of Jhadewa in Mathagadhi rural municipality has bee hives, around 90, on his terrace.He has been keeping traditional wooden hives for seven decades. Palli’s source of income is honey produced in the hives. But he is facing the same problems as Karki and Bhattarai.“Nobody has taken an initiative to solve the problem,” said Palli.Small investments, less hard work, and good benefits made beekeeping lucrative for many villagers. What threatens the occupation’s sustainability is that beekeepers do not receive technical and promotional support from the government. “Who will help us?” questions Palli. “I have been doing it on my own. I go to Tarai to sell the honey, and I am fine with that.”The subsidies provided by the government are gobbled up by those who are clever and have direct access to it, said Palli.Customers now reach farmers’ homes to buy honey, so there is no problem with sales. However, problems with beekeeping have only compounded.“I used to make at least Rs150,000 from honey a year. But, recently, there are no bees in half the hives,” said Palli. “Bees are disappearing. Most hives are empty. Even others have fewer bees.”Farmers are unable to stop bees from dying or fleeing. Though they have tried to retain the bees, nothing seems to be working.Farmers say long dry spells of winter, lack of bee pasture and excessive rainfall were also the reasons behind the declining bee populations.Marmara in Palpa is a good bee pasture area. Agriculture technicians said honey can be extracted three to five times in this area.Palli said that though he could save bees from other wild insects and pests, he failed to save them from dying due to the excessive use of harmful chemicals.Santosh Kumar Chaudhary, an agri expert and acting chief of the Agriculture Knowledge Centre, said that due to the impact of climate change, pests have been increasing, and farmers are applying more pesticides. “Recently, village farmers have started using pesticides on vegetables, fruits, and round chillis. But no one is aware of its direct and indirect impact.”Haphazard use of pesticides has not only made people suffer from diseases but also hugely impacted bees, Chaudhary said.The Agriculture Knowledge Center has removed subsidies for beekeepers.With the failure of the Smart Krishi Programme operated in Marmara of Jhadewa, Mathagadhi rural municipality by the Lumbini province, the government has allocated funds only for general training.Chaudhary said beekeepers had not been informed about the problem.However, according to the Agriculture Knowledge Centre, farmers’ use of pesticides for commercial farming might have impacted bees.With or without government support, farmers are earning well from beekeeping and are commercialising beekeeping at low costs.The government data shows there are more than 20,000 bee hives in Palpa. If the processing, packaging, and market management can be done with less pesticide use, farmers can be more commercial and earn more, said an agri expert. \nWomen play critical roles in the lives of writers, providing inspiration, support, and enduring compassion, as evidenced by the experiences of the wives of literary figures like Leo Tolstoy, PB Shelley, and Laxmi Prasad Devkota, highlighting the significance of their contributions and the need for recognition in literary criticism.\nPhysical and mental health issues are prevalent worldwide, leading to conditions like stress, depression, and weakened immune systems, with meditation recognized as a tool to promote well-being and reduce these ailments.\nPakistan's youth, the nation's future, grapple with challenges, requiring guidance from parents, role models, and understanding of life's complexities, while social media and religious teachings play significant roles in shaping their paths.\nAir pollution in Nepal has reached critical levels, significantly reducing life expectancy, with the government's directives often ignored, highlighting the need for comprehensive collaboration and systemic changes to improve air quality.\nA car-ramming attack at a Christmas market in Germany sparked political tensions as authorities investigate a Saudi suspect with anti-Islamic views while the far-right AfD party mobilizes supporters under the guise of a vigil.\nDelhi's severe air pollution (AQI 700) prompted temporary school closures and mask use, but the crisis eased as AQI dropped below 250, raising concerns about ignorance leading to Kolkata's increasing air pollution (150-200 AQI) due to transboundary pollution, natural factors, and anthropogenic activities.\nWith hostile Turkish-backed groups mobilising against them in Syria's north, and Damascus ruled by a group friendly to Ankara, Syria's main Kurdish factions are on the back foot as they seek to preserve political gains carved out during 13 years of war.Part of a stateless ethnic group straddling Iraq, Iran, Turkey, Armenia and Syria, Kurds have so far been among the few winners of the Syrian conflict, controlling nearly a quarter of the country and leading a powerful armed group that is a key US ally in countering Islamic State.But the power balance has tilted against them since the Islamist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) swept into Damascus this month, toppling President Bashar al-Assad, two analysts and a senior Western diplomat told Reuters.The seismic change in Syria is expected to yield deeper Turkish sway just as a change of US administration is raising questions over how long Washington will keep backing the country's Kurdish-led forces.For Turkey, the Kurdish factions represent a national security threat. Ankara views them as an extension of the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), which has been waging an insurgency against the Turkish state since 1984 and is deemed a terrorist group by Turkey, the United States and other powers.The Syrian Kurdish groups \"are in deep, deep trouble\", said Aron Lund, a fellow at Century International, a US-based think tank.\"The balance has shifted fundamentally in Syria to the advantage of Turkey-backed or Turkey-aligned factions, and Turkey seems determined to exploit this to the fullest.\"The shift has been reflected in renewed fighting for control of the north, where Turkey-backed armed groups known as the Syrian National Army (SNA) have made military advances against the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF).Fanar al-Kait, a senior official in the Kurdish-led regional administration, told Reuters that the ouster of Assad, whose Arab nationalist Baath Party oppressed Kurds for decades, presented a chance to stitch the fragmented country back together.He said the administration is ready for dialogue with Turkey, but the conflict in the north showed Ankara had \"very bad intentions\".\"This will certainly push the region towards ... a new conflict,\" he added.Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan said on Friday he expected foreign states would withdraw support for Kurdish fighters following Assad's toppling, as Ankara seeks to isolate the People's Protection Units (YPG), the Kurdish militia that spearheaded the SDF alliance.Responding to questions from Reuters, a Turkish official said the root cause of the conflict is \"not Turkey's view towards the region; it is that the PKK/YPG is a terrorist organisation\".\"The PKK/YPG elements must lay down their arms and leave Syria,\" the official said.SDF commander Mazloum Abdi, in a Reuters interview on Thursday, acknowledged the presence of PKK fighters in Syria for the first time, saying they had helped battle Islamic State and would return home in the event a total ceasefire was agreed with Turkey. He denied any organisational ties with the PKK.FEMINISM AND ISLAMISMMeanwhile, in Damascus, the new leadership is showing warmth towards Ankara and indicating it wants to bring all Syria back under central authority - a potential challenge to the decentralisation Kurds favour.While Turkey provides direct backing to the SNA, it along with other states deems HTS a terrorist group because of its al Qaeda past.Despite this, Ankara is believed to have significant sway over the group. A senior Western diplomat said: \"The Turks can clearly influence them more than anyone else\".HTS leader Ahmed al-Sharaa told a Turkish newspaper that Assad's ouster was \"not only the victory of the Syrian people, but also the Turkish people\".The Turkish official said HTS was not and never had been under Ankara's control, calling it a structure \"we were communicating with due to circumstances\" and adding many Western states were also doing so.Syrian Kurdish groups led by the Democratic Union Party (PYD) and the affiliated YPG militia took control of much of the north after the uprising against Assad began in 2011. They established their own administration, while insisting their aim was autonomy, not independence.Their politics, emphasising socialism and feminism, differ starkly from HTS' Islamism.Their area grew as US-led forces partnered with the SDF in the campaign against Islamic State, capturing Arab-majority areas.The Turkey-backed SNA groups stepped up their campaign against the SDF as Assad was being toppled, seizing the city of Manbij on December 9Washington brokered a ceasefire, but the SDF has said Turkey and its allies have not abided by it, and a Turkish defence ministry official said there was no such deal.US support for the SDF has been a point of tension with its NATO ally, Turkey. Washington views the SDF as a key partner in countering Islamic State, which Secretary of State Antony Blinken has warned will try to use this period to re-establish capabilities in Syria. The SDF is still guarding tens of thousands of detainees linked to the militant group.Turkish Defence Minister Yasar Guler said last weekend that Turkey saw no sign of an Islamic State resurgence in Syria. On Friday, Turkey's foreign minister, Hakan Fidan, told his German counterpart during talks in Ankara that alternatives needed to be found for the management of camps and prisons where the detainees are being held.Separately, US Assistant Secretary of State for Near Eastern Affairs Barbara Leaf said on Friday that Washington was working with Ankara and the SDF to find \"a managed transition in terms of SDF's role in that part of the country.\"President Joe Biden's administration has said that US troops will stay on in Syria, but President-elect Donald Trump could remove them when he takes office on January 20.LETTER TO TRUMPDuring his first administration, Trump attempted to pull out of Syria but faced pressure at home and from US allies.In a December 17 letter to Trump, reviewed by Reuters, top Syrian Kurdish official Ilham Ahmed said Turkey was preparing to invade the northeast before he takes office.Turkey's plan \"threatens to undo years of progress in securing stability and fighting terrorism\", she wrote. \"We believe you have the power to prevent this catastrophe.\"Trump's transition team did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Trump said on December 16 that Turkey will \"hold the key\" to what happens in Syria but has not announced his plans for US forces stationed there.\"The Kurds are in an unenviable position,\" said Joshua Landis, a Syria expert at the University of Oklahoma. \"Once Damascus consolidates its power, it will move on the region. The US can't remain there forever.\"HTS leader Sharaa told British broadcaster the BBC that Kurds were \"part of our people\" and \"there should be no division of Syria\", adding arms should be entirely in the state's hands.Sharaa acknowledged one of Turkey's main concerns—the presence of non-Syrian Kurdish fighters in Syria—and said: \"We do not accept that Syrian lands threaten and destabilize Turkey or other places.\"He pledged to work through dialogue and negotiations to find \"a peaceful formula to solve the problem,\" saying he believed initial contacts had been established \"between the Kurds in northeastern Syria or the SDF organisation\".Kait, the Kurdish official, said his administration wanted \"a democratic Syria, a decentralized Syria, a Syria that represents all Syrians of all sects, religions and ethnicities,\" describing these as red lines. The SDF would be \"a nucleus of the coming Syrian army,\" he added.SDF commander Abdi, in his Reuters interview, confirmed that contact had been established with HTS to avoid clashes between their forces but said Ankara would try to drive a wedge between Damascus and the Kurdish-led administration.Still, he said there was strong support from international parties, including the US-led coalition, for the SDF joining \"the new political phase\" in Damascus, calling it \"a great opportunity\".\"We are preparing, after a total ceasefire between us and between Turkey and the affiliated factions, to join this phase,\" he said. \nThe Meteorological Forecasting Division has said that a mild influence of a westerly disturbance is currently affecting Nepal. Gandaki, Karnali, and Sudurpaschim provinces are experiencing partial cloud cover, while other regions have generally clear skies. This morning, fog has been observed in some parts of the Tarai and Valleys. There is also a likelihood of mist in certain areas of the Tarai, potentially impacting daily activities, tourism, mountaineering, road transport, and aviation. The division has urged necessary precautions.   \nA packed bus collided with a truck and burst into flames early on Saturday in Brazil, killing at least 22 people, the fire department said.The bus carrying 45 passengers had a tire blowout and the driver lost control of the vehicle, which crashed into an oncoming truck loaded with tiles at 4 am on a major highway near the town of Teofilo Otoni, in Minas Gerais state.Firefighters said they rescued 13 passengers from the wrecked bus. Three occupants of a car that also collided and was trapped under the truck survived the accident.“Firefighters have recovered 22 bodies from the bus, and more victims are still to be removed,” fireman Alonso Vieira Junior said in a video released by the fire department.He said a crane was needed to access another section of the bus where additional victims are located. \nAt least five people were killed in a car-ramming attack at a German Christmas market in the city of Magdeburg that also left more than 200 injured, officials said, and a Saudi man was arrested on suspicion of driving a car into the crowd.The Friday evening attack on market visitors gathered to celebrate the pre-Christmas season comes amid a fierce debate over security and migration during an election campaign in Germany, where the far right is polling strongly.“What a terrible act it is to injure and kill so many people there with such brutality,” Chancellor Olaf Scholz said in the central city, part of the former East Germany, where he laid a white rose at a church in honour of the victims.“We have now learnt that over 200 people have been injured,” he added. “Almost 40 are so seriously injured that we must be very worried about them.”German authorities are investigating a 50-year-old Saudi doctor who has lived in Germany for almost two decades in connection with the car-ramming. Police searched his home overnight.The motive remained unclear and police have not yet named the suspect. He has been named in German media as Taleb A.A Saudi source told Reuters that Saudi Arabia had warned German authorities about the attacker after he posted extremist views on his personal X account that threatened peace and security.Der Spiegel reported that the suspect had sympathised with the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party. The magazine did not say where it got the information.Germany’s domestic intelligence agency declined to comment on the ongoing investigation.Germany’s FAZ newspaper said it interviewed the suspect in 2019, describing him as an anti-Islam activist.“People like me, who have an Islamic background but are no longer believers, are met with neither understanding nor tolerance by Muslims here,” he was quoted as saying. “I am history’s most aggressive critic of Islam. If you don’t believe me, ask the Arabs.”Andrea Reis, who had been at the market on Friday, returned on Saturday with her daughter Julia to lay a candle by the church overlooking the site. She said that had it not been for a matter of moments, they may have been in the car’s path.“I said, ‘let’s go and get a sausage’, but my daughter said ‘no let’s keep walking around.’ If we’d stayed where we were we’d have been in the car’s path,” she said.Tears ran down her face as she described the scene. “Children screaming, crying for mama. You can’t forget that,” she said.Scholz’s Social Democrats are trailing both the far-right AfD and the frontrunner conservative opposition in opinion polls ahead of snap elections set for February 23.The AfD, which enjoys particularly strong support in the former East, has led calls for a crackdown on migration to the country.Its chancellor candidate Alice Weidel and co-leader Tino Chrupalla issued a statement on Saturday condemning the attack.“The terrible attack on the Christmas market in Magdeburg in the middle of the peaceful pre-Christmas period has shaken us,” they said.A leading Social Democrat lawmaker in the Bundestag parliament warned against jumping to conclusions and said it appeared the attacker did not have an Islamist motive.“Now we have to wait for the investigations. It seems that things are different here than was initially assumed,” Dirk Wiese told the Rheinische Post newspaper. \nSudurpaschim Royals have set a formidable 185-run target for Janakpur Bolts in the Nepal Premier League (NPL) cricket final, thanks to a century partnership between Saif Zaib and Binod Bhandari.Batting first at the Tribhuvan University Cricket Ground in Kirtipur after winning the toss, Sudurpaschim scored 184 runs, losing 9 wickets. Captain Dipendra Singh Airee’s decision to bat first paid off as Zaib and Bhandari dominated the opening 12 overs, adding 117 runs for the first wicket.Zaib, who scored a brisk half-century off 33 balls, helped Sudurpaschim make an explosive start, with 97 runs in the first 10 overs without losing a wicket. He was dropped on 62 in the 13th over, but Kishore Mahato dismissed him shortly after for 69 runs off 43 balls, hitting 8 fours and 2 sixes. Mahato also took two crucial wickets in the final over, finishing with figures of 3 for 25 in 3 overs.Bhandari, the other opener, contributed a steady 41 runs off 31 balls, including 1 four and 3 sixes, before being bowled by Lalit Rajbanshi, who impressed with an economical spell, conceding only 15 runs in his 4 overs with 1 maiden.Other contributions came from Harmeet Singh (14 off 8 balls), Scott Kuggeleijn (13 off 10 balls), and Jimmy Neesham (14 off 12 balls). Dipendra Airee (9) and Aarif Sheikh (1) fell cheaply in the middle order. Mohammad Mohsin also claimed 3 wickets, conceding 40 runs in his 4 overs.Janakpur’s bowlers struggled against Sudurpaschim’s top-order batting, but Lalit Rajbanshi’s disciplined performance stood out. Jimmy Neesham and Kishore Mahato picked up a wicket each, with Neesham conceding 44 runs in 4 overs.Both teams fielded unchanged line-ups from their previous matches. Sudurpaschim advanced to the final after defeating Janakpur in Qualifier 1, while Janakpur overcame Karnali Yaks in Qualifier 2.Sudurpaschim have been dominant throughout the tournament, winning 7 out of 8 matches, including two victories against Janakpur. In the group stage, they beat Janakpur by 72 runs and dismissed them for a record-low 51 runs.Janakpur, led by New Zealand all-rounder Jimmy Neesham, reached the final by defeating Karnali in a thrilling Qualifier 2. Neesham took 2 wickets and scored a quick 45 off 17 balls to chase down Karnali’s 118-run target with an over to spare.With Sudurpaschim’s recent record and Janakpur’s resilience, the NPL final promises an exciting contest. \nJanakpur Bolts clinched the Nepal Premier League (NPL) cricket title with a spectacular five-wicket win over Sudurpaschim Royals, thanks to Lahiru Milantha’s stunning batting performance. Milantha’s 87 off 49 balls led Janakpur to chase down a challenging 185-run target with four balls to spare at the Tribhuvan University Cricket Ground in Kirtipur on Saturday.Janakpur got off to a flying start, adding 71 runs in the powerplay and 105 runs in the first 10 overs. Milantha, who completed his half-century in just 31 balls, was dropped on 65 when Sudurpaschim captain Dipendra Singh Airee missed a caught-and-bowled opportunity. Milantha’s innings included 9 fours and 4 sixes.Opener Aasif Sheikh contributed 33 runs off 19 balls, featuring 4 fours and 2 sixes, setting a solid foundation for Janakpur. Lower-order contributions from Harsh Thaker (30 off 24 balls) and Mayank Yadav (2 not out) sealed the victory. Sudurpaschim’s bowlers struggled, with Airee conceding 40 runs for a wicket in his 4 overs, while Saif Zaib, Ishan Pandey, and Scott Kuggeleijn took one wicket each.Earlier, Sudurpaschim posted 184 runs after electing to bat first. Opener Saif Zaib scored a brisk 69 off 43 balls, and Binod Bhandari added 41 off 31 balls, sharing a 117-run stand for the first wicket. Janakpur’s Kishore Mahato (3/25) and Mohammad Mohsin (3/40) led the bowling attack, restricting Sudurpaschim’s middle order.Janakpur’s triumph marked a comeback, as Sudurpaschim had defeated them twice earlier in the tournament. With this win, Janakpur Bolts emerged as the champions of the NPL, showcasing resilience and brilliant teamwork in the final. \nLahiru Milantha's final match heroics propelled him to the top of the scoring charts, while Lalit Rajbanshi and Scott Kuggeleijn's bowling prowess led the tournament in wicket-taking.\nSeven years and seven months after inking the Memorandum of Understanding on the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), Nepal and China on Wednesday signed a framework for BRI cooperation during Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli’s China visit, which ends on Thursday.Acting Foreign Secretary Amrit Bahadur Rai and deputy head of China’s National Development and Reform Commission Liu Sushe signed the framework cooperation on behalf of the respective countries. The commission is the focal agency in China, tasked with the development of BRI projects.The framework will be valid for three years and will get another three-year extension unless terminated by either side.Speaking briefly from Beijing with the Post, Foreign Minister Arzu Rana Deuba said that the framework signed on Wednesday is not new. “It should be understood as a continuation of the memorandum of understanding signed in 2017,” she added.A joint task force of the Nepali Congress and the CPN-UML, the two largest parties and ruling partners, in Kathmandu had tweaked the original BRI implementation plan proposed by the Chinese side in 2020.Wednesday’s development formally endorses Nepal’s involvement in the BRI, a programme China proposed and Nepal initially signed in 2017. But negotiations on the projects under the BRI could still prove difficult in the future.‘Aid financing modalities’, as have been agreed under the new framework, have elements of both grant and loan, said one Nepali official who is a part of Oli’s delegation in Beijing.“Even as we signed the framework, we were clear that we cannot accept projects under the BRI with interest rates exceeding those charged by bilateral and multilateral donors,” the official said. “Our focus would be on seeking grants and concessional loans in line with the interest rates offered by the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank and other bilateral and multilateral agencies.”Wednesday’s agreement paves the way for negotiations on the ten projects that Nepal had proposed to China.“Today, we signed the Framework for Belt and Road Cooperation,” Prime Minister Oli wrote in his X account. “I am honoured to reflect on the bilateral talks with Premier Li Qiang, discussions with National People’s Congress of China Chairman Zhao Leji and the highly fruitful meeting with President Xi Jinping.”The economic cooperation between Nepal and China will further strengthen under the Belt and Road Framework Cooperation, writes Oli.Just ahead of the prime minister’s departure for Beijing on Monday, the Nepali side had sent a new version of the framework for BRI cooperation and insisted on grants as the project financing model. But the Chinese side objected to the words and replaced them with ‘assistance financing’ and sent the document back to the Nepali side for consideration.“Then we sat again, spoke with the prime minister and proposed a middle path using the phrase ‘aid financing’ as a modality,” one Nepali member of the delegation told the Post from Beijing over the phone. “The Chinese took some time to consider our proposal. Therefore, the new BRI framework is missing in the joint communiqué released late Tuesday. Eventually, both parties agreed on the term ‘aid assistance financing’ and the agreement was signed on Wednesday.” On Nepal’s side, the negotiations were led by Prime Minister Oli’s economic and development adviser Yubaraj Khatiwada, Foreign Minister Arzu Rana Deuba and Acting Foreign Secretary Rai. High-ranking foreign ministry officials represented the Chinese delegation.As Nepal and China are in different stages of development, projects will be selected on the basis of Nepal’s specific requirements and needs. During project negotiation, the final BRI framework agreement states, both sides should uphold the principle of technical, financial, commercial and economic viability and value for money. Likewise, both sides will work to create a conducive business environment.The ‘Objective’ of the BRI framework cooperation states that both sides should facilitate the financial and technical cooperation for each project, and they identified the areas of cooperation—economic development, financial sector cooperation, transport, connectivity and logistic cooperation, trade industrial capacity and investment cooperation, and customs clearance—according to another member of the Nepali delegation who is in Beijing.Nepal has proposed ten different projects to be executed under the BRI. They are Tokha-Chhahare tunnel road, Hilsa-Simikot road project, Kimathanka-Khandbari road and bridge, Jilong-Kerung-Kathmandu cross-border railway, Amargadhi City Hall in Dadeldhura, Jilong-Kerung-Rasuwagadhi-Chilime 220KV transmission line, Madan Bhandari University, Kathmandu Scientific Centre and Science Museum, China-Nepal friendship industrial park in Damak and Jhapa sports and athletic complex.Nepal will set priorities and prepare the implementation plan for each of these projects. The Nepali side, in the negotiation phase, had changed several proposals.The Nepali side significantly shortened the list of priority areas originally proposed by the Chinese side in early 2020 which included construction of the Trans-Himalayan Multi Dimensional Connectivity Network, including ports, roads, bridges, tunnels, highways, railways, aviation infrastructure, telecom projects, electricity transmission line, carrying out the China-Nepal cross-border railway project.Similarly, the two sides will develop implementation plans for energy related projects, cooperation in the field of e-commerce and trade and industrial capacity enhancement, building trade infrastructures, adopting trade and investment liberalisation, and expanding bilateral economic relationship.The BRI framework provides significant impetus for a stronger economic and project development partnership between the two countries, said Semanta Dahal, who was part of the task force that revised the BRI framework on behalf of the ruling coalition in a capacity of legal adviser. He added that it addresses ambiguities surrounding the infrastructure projects to be implemented under the BRI in Nepal and establishes clear negotiation principles, including the use of aid financing.“This will facilitate negotiations on a project-by-project basis and ensure that infrastructure and connectivity projects offer value for money,” he said. \nNepali officials were paid $2.5 million in bribes to seal the contract for the $209.6-million Airbus deal, the largest in Nepal’s aviation history, charging documents filed in the US court show.Deepak Sharma, a former executive of the US-based aviation services provider AAR, pleaded guilty in July earlier this year to conspiracy to violate the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) anti-bribery provisions. The charges were based on allegations that Sharma was part of a conspiracy to bribe Nepali officials to secure two Airbus A330 deals in 2017.Sharma pleaded guilty and agreed to forfeit around $130,000. His sentences are yet to be determined, so this case is ongoing.Sharma, a Nepal-born British citizen, joined AAR in 2015. Before this, he was the chief technical officer at AJW Group, which he joined in 2008. He has also been the engineering director at UK International Airlines.According to the documents in this case obtained by the Post, between November 2015 and August 2018, Sharma conspired with others to pay bribes to Nepali officials to win a bid to sell two Airbus A330-200 aircraft on behalf of AAR Corp to Nepal Airlines Corporation.On June 24, 2024, the US Department of Justice alleged that Sharma—as an agent for AAR—conspired to bribe Nepali officials and filed a single count of information under seal in the District of Columbia, alleging a conspiracy to violate the FCPA’s anti-bribery provisions.In July, guilty pleas were publicly revealed, five years after AAR disclosed possible FCPA violations. The court unsealed the case on August 1, 2024, in connection with a plea agreement.In December 2016, Nepal Airlines selected a group consisting of AAR Corp, German Aviation Capital, and Hi Fly (airline) of Portugal to purchase two widebody aircraft. The month before, according to the investigation transcript, Sharma sent a text message to a conspirator, stating: “I am having dinner with the head of the evaluation committee now. We are discussing how to throw others out even if they come below our bid. See you tomorrow.”In an Information filed, the US Department of Justice alleged that Sharma, on behalf of AAR, agreed to bribe Nepali officials to manipulate the deal in favour of AAR and a German aircraft leasing and trading company, working with a Nepali intermediary and an unnamed co-conspirator [a director of an affiliate of the German company] to facilitate a sham transaction between the German aircraft company and Nepal Airlines.The Information describes Sharma’s email and text communications, as well as invoices and wire transfer records, which record payments made by the German company's Ireland-based Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) to a United Arab Emirates-based bank account used by the Nepali intermediary to fund bribes to Nepali officials. In Nepal, on April 4, the Commission for Investigation of Abuse of Authority (CIAA), the constitutional anti-graft body, completed its five-year probe into the Airbus deal, concluding that procuring two wide-body Airbus A330 jets caused a loss of Rs1.47 billion ($13.38 million) to the government.The loss was computed based on the exchange rate at the time of the last instalment payment in 2018.The CIAA filed a case against 32 individuals at the Special Court for their alleged corruption in the deal, commonly known as the ‘wide-body scam’. The court is expected to issue a verdict within this month.The first of the two wide-body aircraft, Annapurna, arrived at the Tribhuvan International Airport in June 2018. The second, Makalu, came a month later.In a statement, the commission said it had filed the case against a former minister, high-level sitting and retired government officials, private sector representatives, and aircraft suppliers.The accused are former tourism minister Jeevan Bahadur Shahi, former managing director of Nepal Airlines Sugat Ratna Kansakar, former tourism secretary Shankar Adhikari and former finance secretary Shishir Kumar Dhungana.At the time of the deal, Adhikari and Dhungana were on the board of the national flag carrier.In charging documents filed in the US court, Sharma is described as an “agent” of Company 1 (a reference to AAR).“It was the purpose of the conspiracy for Sharma and his co-conspirators to illegally benefit Company 1, Subsidiary 1 [a wholly-owned subsidiary of Company 1], and others by bribing Nepali officials, including Foreign Official 1 [a Nepali citizen who served as a high-level official at Nepal Airlines Corporation from at least approximately 2015 through 2019] in order to win a bid to sell two Airbus A330-200 aircraft to the state-owned national carrier.”Sharma and his co-conspirators made and received wire transfers intended, in part, as bribes for Nepali officials in connection with Nepal Airlines Corporation transactions, using bank accounts in the United States, Ireland, and the United Arab Emirates, among other places.Sharma and his co-conspirators attempted to disguise the wire transfers as legitimate business transactions by entering into sham agreements between Subsidiary 2 [a wholly-owned subsidiary of Company 1], Company 2 [an aircraft leasing and trading company based in Germany], and Company 3 [a special purpose vehicle incorporated in Ireland and managed by Company 2] on the one hand, and Companies 4 [a Hong Kong incorporated company used by Intermediary] and 5 [a United Arab Emirates incorporated company used by Intermediary] on the other. Some payments were made under sham invoices sent by Sharma and his co-conspirators from Companies 4 and 5 and directed to Company 3. The invoices falsely referred to the bribe payments as “advances”.“In total, between in or around May and August 2018, Company 3 paid Company 5 the equivalent of approximately $2,500,000 in connection with Nepal Airlines transaction, a portion of which Sharma understood would be distributed as bribes to Nepali officials, including Foreign Official 1.”On or about March 29, 2016, approximately six months before Nepal Airlines publicly issued a Request for Proposal (RFP) for the purchase of two A330s, Sharma forwarded an email to two executives at Company 1 containing a draft RFP that was circulated among Nepal Airlines Corporation officials, including Foreign Official 1. In his email to the two executives at Company 1, Sharma stated, “Please find attached Draft RFP[.] NOTE: [T]his [is] not published yet, and it is strictly for three of us [a Company 1 executive], you and I, to comment and change any terms to suit [Company 1]. Let me know if you want any changes made to the payment terms or bid terms so that it favours [Company 1]. I can ask these to be incorporated [sic] into the RFP for publication. I am meeting with the [Foreign Official 1] and Chairman this week…”On or about September 1, 2016, approximately one month before Nepal Airlines Corporation publicly issued the RFP, Foreign Official 1 sent an email to Sharma, writing, “What I have in mind is that we will specify MOU signing date, purchase agreement date and delivery date in such a way that [a competitor of Company 1] cannot meet delivery dates.“Following are tentative dates, and I want your feedback on whether you can meet delivery dates… Tentative dates I fixed but not yet shared with other Nepal Airlines executives…”On October 30, 2016, Foreign Official 1 texted Sharma, “[N]o need to worry at all. Almost all higher-ups are in our pocket.”On May 15, 2018, Sharma sent Individual 1 a text message about Intermediary and Foreign Official 1 pressuring to pay Company 5’s invoice, writing, “The Nepali guys is [sic] chasing like hell.”On May 17, 2018, Sharma sent an email to Individual 1 with an attached invoice from Company 5 to Company 3 for $450,000 for “Service Provided for Bid and Sale of X2A330 as an Advance.”On July 3, 2018, Individual 1 and others caused a wire transfer of approximately 390,000 EURO (the equivalent of roughly $450,000) from Company 3’s bank account in Ireland to Company 5’s bank account in the United Arab Emirates, in part for the benefit of Nepali officials, including Foreign Official 1On August 9, 2018, the Intermediary emailed Sharma, attaching two invoices from Company 5 to Company 3 for $1,000,000 each for “Service Provided for Bid and sale of X2 A330 as an Advance.”On August 10, 2018, Individual 1 and others caused two wire transfers of approximately $1,000,000 each from Company 3’s bank account in Ireland to Company 5’s bank account in the United Arab Emirates, partly for the benefit of Nepali officials, including Foreign Official 1. \nNepal has almost everything it needs for prosperity: A strategic location, tourism potential, hydropower and a young population. Yet, we are trapped in a vicious cycle of low growth and high migration. When the Constitution was finally promulgated two decades after the launch of the Maoist People’s War, we expected politics to be our salvation. Unfortunately, it has become our prison.Nepal's low-growth, high-migration trap isn't just an economic phenomenon—it's a political protection mechanism that preserves an unsustainable kleptocracy and crony capitalism. While the World Bank calls for a “systematic assault” on economic barriers, what Nepal needs is a paradigm shift that will fundamentally transform power relations and dismantle extractive networks.Without such a shift, emerging political agency and a growing structural crisis will create a rupture. The absence of comprehensive political and economic reforms is a matter of serious concern for Nepalis. It does not just affect our graduation to a middle-income status, which has already been pushed behind schedule; it also impacts the lives of millions of people and determines Nepal’s development trajectory.The trapSince the World Bank's initial analysis in 2017, Nepal's “low-growth, high-migration trap” has deepened. According to the World Bank, low-growth fails to generate employment. As a result, a large number of youth are forced to migrate. Migration brings in remittance, enabling consumption but no productive investment. High remittance not only creates economic distortions, but also reduces pressure on the top leaders to deliver reforms. The lack of reforms, in turn, reinforces low growth.Despite poverty reduction, Nepal has been growing at only about 4 percent, marginally better than the 2 percent growth achieved in 2023. At this rate, Nepal will be unable to graduate from LDC at least until 2030.Nepal’s economic trends and fiscal positions are becoming increasingly unsustainable, creating pressures for change. For example, budget execution rates are below 80 percent, revenue collection is dwindling, capital expenditure is low, and the debt service burden is rising.While the per capita income remains at around $1,400, limiting job creation, the manufacturing sector’s GDP share has shrunk by half since 2008. While migration is increasing, fiscal indicators are worsening. Our dependence on migration is growing. While public debt is about 44 percent of the GDP, our revenues are shrinking. Debt servicing and financial management consume almost 20 percent of the budget, while development expenditure has shrunk to 19 percent and is poorly executed.Political agencyThe kleptocracy, patronised by top political leaders, extracts power and money from the people and the state. In doing so, they misuse state power, distort its bodies and hollow out legal institutions. Despite this, political agency has failed to drive change.Institutions like the World Bank have been advocating comprehensive reforms. For example, they want to break policy barriers, build new growth sources, revitalise agriculture, address migration issues and unleash financial reforms. These reforms would make the economy more competitive, productive and broad-based. All of these recommendations directly impact the existing extractive system dominated by crony capitalism, kleptocracy and political parties. Initiating changes would mean changing the status quo, which is why these suggestions fail.The failure of new parties to put pressure on traditional parties has not helped. When the Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP) emerged just before the 2022 elections, it was largely driven by the aspirations of migrant workers. However, the ethical dilemma posed by evidence of corruption of RSP’s founder has dented the party’s aspirations. When the current coalition was forged, one of the objectives was to deliver results to the people to show them that there was no need for new parties. This strategy has failed. However, the new parties have met the same fate, ultimately benefiting the entrenched leaders. One of the results of this mismatch between people’s expectations and political delivery is the reluctance of people to identify themselves with a political party. Rather, the disenchantment and dissatisfaction echo in social media in fragmented ways. Activism has not worked because people have become distrustful of not only political parties but also activists who claim to represent civil society.Incremental reforms?There are enough people who believe that incremental reforms in the economy will add up and drive change. Some people are also hopeful that the traditional parties are feeling the pressure and will reform, albeit slowly. Then there are others who think we must seek alternatives to the current political system. Many of them tout China as a model of growth and aspire to have “political stability.”None of these approaches will work, unfortunately.Traditional solutions offered by donors and development partners often fail because they cannot address political-economy factors and political dynamics. These solutions focus on the symptoms rather than the root causes. Incremental reforms are often absorbed by the system, with all its deformities. And when the reforms are significant, the kleptocracy swiftly neutralises the attempts.For a few years, the traditional political parties could create the illusion of change, but all that the superficial democracy did was maintain the status quo. The current political system is rooted in extractive kleptocracy because the parties need each other to survive. Reforms will undermine the sources of political power and wealth. Therefore, political reform is impossible without disrupting the existing political power models.The current political malaise has discredited the whole democratic system. Seeking an alternative to the democratic system, however, is not an option. According to renowned economists, democracies perform at least 20 percent better than non-democracies in delivering prosperity. Democracies can also deliver more investment, economic reforms and public goods.A likely ruptureYes, the emergence of new political forces has faltered. Yet, this is only a temporary blip. At least four quarters are pressing for transformation in our political and economic system: the migrant population, urban youth, a traditionalist nationalist force allied with the former monarchy and a liberal-minded civil society. Even if political agency and social movements have failed to produce well-thought-out political movements, structural factors will continue to push for change because the status quo is untenable, and it is little prepared for shocks that may come from unexpected quarters.New structural pressures are building: Demographic transition creates new demands, digital transformation rearranges political psychology and regional economic integration forces competitiveness. Demographic pressures, economic vulnerabilities, migration impacts and urbanisation pressures will continue to generate strain until the status quo breaks.Our hope is that political agency and the structural crisis will align so that we are able to manage the transformation in a meaningful way. Otherwise, instability and chaos will become unavoidable. \nThe debut edition of the Nepal Premier League Twenty20 cricket tournament is set to kick off on Saturday with a festive atmosphere and with so much anticipation that it could write a new chapter in Nepali cricket.Billed as the ‘Festival of Himalayas’, the NPL has already attracted global interest, with the likes of former Indian opener Shikhar Dhawan and New Zealand allrounder James Neesham, among other big cricketing names, set to light up the eight-team competition that will run until December 21.The involvement of Star Sports Network—a group of Indian television sports channels that also holds the rights of flagship tournaments like Indian Premier League, English Premier League, Wimbledon and ICC events—as the official broadcasting partner will now give the league a worldwide exposure.Partnership with Twenty-first Century Media (TCM) Sports—a sports management company that has managed Cricket World Cups, Asia Cups, IPL and other international events—is further evidence that the NPL aspires to evolve into one of the major cricketing events in the world.Organiser Cricket Association of Nepal appears determined to make the league a landmark event, aiming to propel Nepali cricket into an unprecedented era of growth and global recognition.“The organisation of the NPL is itself a big achievement for CAN and Nepali cricket,” CAN Spokesperson Chhumbi Lama told the Post.“For the first time, our domestic tournament will be broadcast worldwide, making the NPL the ideal platform to elevate Nepali cricket to the international stage,” Lama added. “The inaugural league could be a catalyst for Nepali cricket’s golden era.”CAN has laid out ambitious plans to expand the league in future editions, including multi-venue matches, games under floodlights, and a potential home-and-away format within five years.“This year, the NPL will be hosted at TU Cricket Ground, but as eight cricket stadiums are currently under construction, we plan to expand to cities outside the Kathmandu Valley,” Lama said. “If floodlights are installed at TU Ground, the future matches will be even more spectacular.”CAN has also developed a comprehensive business strategy to ensure the league’s sustainability, with goals to attract government investment and international grants.“This will take Nepali cricket into a commercial era, paving the way for further development of the game,” Lama added. CAN is making another effort to establish its own franchise league in the country following a debacle of its previous venture. It had organised Nepal T20 League in the 2022/23 season but the tournament proved a disaster as it was overshadowed by spot-fixing allegations, resulting in the involvement of Central Investigation Bureau and several arrests.CAN also faced criticisms for its mismanagement, negligence and incompetence. Eventually, the contract with Seven3Sports, to which the tournament rights were sold for eight years without a competitive bidding process, had to be terminated.This time, CAN, in its renewed effort to establish a successful franchise cricket league, seems committed to implementing stringent measures to safeguard the integrity of the NPL.Retired AIG Ishwor Babu Karki, who is the Head of Integrity at CAN and oversees anti-corruption, safeguarding, security and anti-doping for the cricket governing body, will lead the oversight unit during the NPL.“We have taken previous mistakes as a lesson. The NPL will be fair,” said Lama.“Karki will oversee the integrity of the NPL. CAN has also coordinated with all the concerned departments to make sure things comply with the ICC protocol,” he added.“CAN wants to assure that the league will be without any controversy.”The NPL—which is building on the foundation laid by earlier tournaments like Everest Premier League, Dhangadhi Premier League and Pokhara Premier League—is also positioning itself as a game-changer for domestic cricket, with the promise of becoming a vital financial lifeline for domestic players.A major highlight is the league’s title sponsorship deal with Siddhartha Bank Limited, which is being hailed as the largest sponsorship agreement in Nepali sports history. However, the exact figures of the agreement have not been disclosed.Eight franchise teams—Biratnagar Kings, Chitwan Rhinos, Janakpur Bolts, Karnali Yaks, Kathmandu Gurkhas, Lumbini Lions, Pokhara Avengers and Sudurpaschim Royals—collectively spent more than Rs50 million rupees in the auction. They secured marquee players for 2 million each, while the players graded into A B and C categories were auctioned at base prices ranging from Rs20,000 to Rs1.5 million.The big investment underscores the league’s ambition to redefine the profile of cricket in Nepal and provide robust financial support to domestic players.While CAN provides monthly incentives to national players, NPL offers a new pathway for many domestic cricketers to build sustainable careers within the country. The tournament will nurture the next generation of cricketing talent by offering them a platform to showcase their skills and catch the attention of national selectors. Each franchise has identified a local iconic player through talent hunts, further strengthening the grassroots impact of the league.“The NPL will be a big support to domestic cricketers,” Lama said. “The players are very motivated by the initiative. It also lays the ground for grassroots cricket development as the teams have conducted talent hunts in the provinces they represent. And the exciting participation of hundreds of teenagers in the hunts is further evidence of the game’s popularity.”In addition to spotlighting emerging players, the NPL offers national cricketers a global stage to showcase their abilities.“The NPL provides an opportunity for national and domestic players to share the field with foreign professionals and world’s best cricketers. This will help them learn, grow, and improve as cricketers,\" said former national player Sharad Vesawkar, who will represent Chitwan Rhinos in the NPL.Vesawkar also emphasised how the league will help highlight Nepali talent to the world while providing a financial boost to local players aspiring to build careers in cricket. \n\n\n\nRae was the envoy to Kathmandu during the promulgation of the 2015 constitution and the subsequent blockade. In this conversation, Rae talks about the evolution of Nepal-India ties since the blockade, regional geopolitics, what the two countries get wrong about each other, how New Delhi views Nepali communist parties and the governments they lead, and the change (if any) in India’s neighbourhood policy since the start of Narendra Modi’s third term in office. \nWhen I visited ‘The Mini Prints Art Fair’, hosted by Siddhartha Art Gallery, I observed a vibrant celebration of contemporary Nepali art showcasing talented artists. The exhibition features 200 intricate mini-prints using etching, woodcut, and embossing techniques.The fair offers diverse artistic interpretations with works ranging from creations such as ‘Unstable II’ by Sujita Maharjan to cultural depictions like ‘Ganapati Bappa’ by Seema Sharma Shah. Delicately crafted pieces encapsulate themes of tradition, identity, and imagination. This fair not only highlights the technical expertise of Nepali artists but also the evolving narrative of contemporary art in the region. Rustom Mody, country director of the British Council Nepal, inaugurated the event, emphasising the fair’s cultural significance. Visitors will have an immersive experience of vibrant stories told through a small-scale yet impactful medium.The exhibition, organised by Printmaking Nepal, highlights the organisation’s dedication to nurturing the art of printmaking among the younger generation. Focusing on education and creativity, the studio conducts workshops to equip aspiring artists with the skills and confidence to pursue their passions. Over the years, they have collaborated with 100 artists, blending the talents of emerging graduates and seasoned professionals. Their primary aim is to foster collaboration between new and established artists, creating a learning environment based on mentorship and experience-sharing.Uma Shankar Shah, one of the founding members of Printmaking Nepal, wants to make print art more accessible by highlighting its affordability. With prices starting from Rs3,000, Shah hopes audiences will embrace Printmaking Nepal’s message: “Art can be affordable and accessible, allowing common people to own and enjoy it without spending a fortune.”He discussed his artwork titled ‘Ramayan’, inspired by his roots in Janakpur. Having previously worked on series like ‘Roti-Beti’, he continues exploring the Maithili storytelling style, which he notes is rarely represented in art. Shah incorporates iconic imagery in his print art ‘Ramayan’, such as the main gate doors, the bow, and Sita Swayamvar. Visitors will notice a deliberate contrast in the artwork’s use of colour, with one piece being colourful and another monochrome. This distinction is achieved using natural elements, including soil, to bring depth and authenticity to the pieces. He says, “Artists face several challenges in pursuing their craft, with the lack of studio space being a primary concern. Thankfully, there are now at least ten studios in Kathmandu where they can work. Another major difficulty is sourcing materials, such as zinc plates and 20x40-inch paper, which are essential for their work. The process is also physically demanding, using acid for etching and handling heavy stones weighing 15-20 kilograms. These stones must be moved repeatedly across tables, requiring careful precision to avoid accidents, which could result in significant setbacks.”As he walked me through the exhibition, it was evident that it did not follow a central theme. He explained, “All the artists centred their work around a basic question: what can society gain from this? In this exhibition, we focus on the post-postmodernism of the 21st century—not rejecting tradition like postmodernism but delving deeper into cultural roots. As we observe in contemporary society, individuals are increasingly drawn to ancient works, whether through traditional designs in clothing or music. Our focus is on representing societal traditions in a new way.”When asked what message he had for emerging artists, he said, “As both an artist and organiser, my advice to them is that there are studios and opportunities available to showcase the work you create right after graduation. So, don’t give up on pursuing this field. Take inspiration from artists like David Basnet, who, despite being in the middle of his master’s degree, already has his artwork featured in this exhibition. Opportunities like these prove that talent and dedication can open doors, even early in your career.”Sujita Maharjan’s series of prints greets visitors, exploring themes of architectural evolution. One of her works critiques the tension between the instability of modern building designs and the rising costs of preserving traditional aesthetics. Another striking piece features a boat with a building. Her print art also incorporates intricate patterns that draw connections to Buddhism, adding a spiritual dimension to her exploration of architecture and culture.Another artist, Lokchitra, one of Nepal’s well-known traditional ‘paubha’ or ‘thangka’ artists, brings his expertise into printmaking with his work ‘Panchabuddha’. He explained, “This work reflects self-realisation, illustrating the five elements present in our bodies: air, water, fire, earth, and aether. ‘Panchabuddha’ essentially represents us, not external forms of Buddha.” In another piece titled ‘Atala’—meaning ‘unmovable’—he depicts a falchion with two blades, symbolising cutting through ignorance by understanding relative and ultimate truths. His art beautifully merges traditional symbolism with contemporary printmaking techniques.Similarly, David Basnet’s contributions include the print ‘Blooms of Thanksgiving’, inspired by the Christmas season, his gardener father, and his love for plants. The blooming cactus featured in his artwork reflects these personal connections. He explained, “Another piece, ‘Through the Bamboos’, was inspired by Nepal’s recent floods. After learning that bamboo helps prevent soil erosion, I created this artwork to highlight its environmental significance.”Basnet’s third work, ‘Old Cycle’, evokes nostalgia for his childhood memories of cycling in Kathmandu. Another of his prints depicts clock hands obstructed by vines but surrounded by blooming flowers. “Even during moments of obstruction, beauty can still emerge,” Basnet shared.Umesh Shah, primarily a painter, shared that he found printmaking interesting through the workshop. His work mainly incorporates Mithila elements inspired by Bastar Art and folk art.

The play was first performed at the Women of the World Nepal 2024 Festival.A majority of the performers identify as differently abled and belong to the LGBTIQA+ community. The play sheds light on the struggles and triumphs of women from marginalised groups, including women with disabilities, queer women, and indigenous women.Deputy Mayor of Kathmandu, Sunita Dangol, said, “It was such a powerful performance. By the end of the show, there wasn’t a single person in the audience without dewy eyes. It is a play that we can relate to on multiple levels.”Tickets are Rs300 for students and theatre artists and Rs500 for general audiences. However, people with disability cards can get free tickets.Sign language interpretation will be available during the performance. However, wheelchair-accessible toilets are unavailable at the venue, though facilities are accessible across the street.____But Still, We RiseWhen: December 27 to 28Where: Shilpee Theatre, BattisputaliEntry: Rs500 \nAs a kid, I was drawn to horror movies. Even though they were frightening, I couldn’t resist the thrill they provided. As I entered my teens, I slowly moved away from movies and began reading. I naturally gravitated toward psychological thrillers, especially those by Indian author Navoneel Chakraborty. Chakraborty’s Stranger Trilogy introduced me to this genre, and at just thirteen, I found it so terrifying that it robbed me of sleep—it felt as intense as watching horror movies.Now, in my early 20s, I still seek that same adrenaline rush. My recent read, ‘His Afflicted Mind’ by Prabigyan Aryal, was the ideal book to appease my craving. It left me wondering what would happen next, and in my search for answers, I couldn’t stop reading. The book was a mix of thrill and fear, keeping me hooked until the last page.Aryal has delved into layered childhood trauma, mental illness, and depression, dissecting these themes. How does the mind of a mentally ill individual function? How can childhood trauma affect an individual’s psyche? These are some of the questions explored in this novel. The novel’s first page contains a trigger warning. Reading it, I prepared for what lies ahead. The story starts when one of the protagonists, Aria, talks to her therapist, Dedric. Shaking uncontrollably and feeling nervous, Aria struggles to share things with her therapist. Dedric tries his best to comfort her to share, as reflected in this line: “Don’t be nervous. I am here to listen. I will respect what you have to say. Take as much time as you want.” Finding comfort in his words, Aria talks about her past. The book then continues in retrospect from December 2, 2017. This narrative technique piqued my curiosity. In the present, Aria struggles to speak to the therapist, and the author's choice of words to articulate her feelings left me wondering how she reached this place mentally.On December 2, 2017, in the fictional town of Ashvale—depicted as bleak and frigid under the grip of a harsh winter—Aria recounts her meeting with Arlo, her cherished childhood friend. She yearns for him, aching to return to their carefree days at age eleven when worries unburdened life. Through her recollection, it becomes clear that Arlo, too, struggled mentally, masking his pain behind a smile. Aria longs to be the one to make him smile, to soothe and love him. However, her yearning never materialises, plunging her into a profound sadness. Her sorrow is so overwhelming that she stands out as the saddest character I have ever read about.As readers turn a few more pages, they uncover not only the depths of Aria’s sorrow but also the severity of her deteriorating mental health. Aria hears sounds that aren’t real and sees things invisible to others. One day, after hearing strange noises, she peers outside her window and surveys the scene. Despite the thick fog, she spots a man dressed entirely in black, smiling at her. The moment she blinks, he vanishes. At first, readers might dismiss this as a fragment of her imagination. However, it becomes evident that it’s something deeper—schizophrenia, which manifests in such vivid hallucinations.Aria’s hallucinations go beyond the man in black; she also repeatedly sees a little girl outside her window—the haunting image of her dead daughter, whom she had burned alive when the child was just five years old. Her fractured mind weaves intricate delusions, using the letters ‘no’ and ‘ah’ from her parents’ names, Norbert and Hannah, to conjure an imaginary brother named Noah. Aria recounts a vivid memory of watching Noah murder her parents right before her eyes when she was a child.However, as the story unfolds, readers discover it was Aria herself who slit her parents’ throats. Her mind, unable to cope with the trauma, deceived her into believing false memories. This twist reveals that Aria suffers not only from schizophrenia but also from confabulation. In this condition, imagined scenarios are confused with real memories, leaving her unable to distinguish between the two.Hence, the book plunges readers into a shadowy, unsettling world of suspense and unease. As I read, I felt an eerie sensation. The author’s ability to evoke such emotions is commendable.What makes ‘His Afflicted Mind' especially engaging is its unpredictable nature. The narrative is slow-paced, deliberately, as it doesn’t reveal everything. Instead, the story keeps you guessing, feeding your curiosity piece by piece. Mysterious events unfold one after another, and just when you think you’ve figured things out, another twist takes you by surprise. This constant anticipation kept me glued to the book, unable to put it down. Additionally, Aryal captures the inner workings of a mentally ill mind with a raw, unfiltered authenticity. Tackling significant subjects like mental illness and childhood trauma while battling depression must have been a difficult task for Aryal. In the author’s note, he writes, “I wrote this book as a way of dealing with depression in my own life and in the hopes of getting more people to understand about what goes on in the mind of someone who is psychologically ill.” In addition, the writing style in ‘His Afflicted Mind’ is characterised by its simplicity, making it accessible to a broad audience. However, readers should be prepared to encounter a few grammatical errors throughout the book. For example, on page 105, the sentence reads, “She is more precious that life itself,” and on page 212, “I cannot to do this.” These errors disrupted the flow of the story and detracted from the emotional impact the book was striving to convey. It’s unfortunate, as more attention from the author and editor could have ensured a more polished reading experience. _____His Afflicted MindAuthor: Prabigyan Aryal Publisher: Daami Year: 2019Pages: 218 \nChildSafeNet (CSN), in collaboration with UNICEF Nepal, launched a situation paper titled “Nepal’s Digital Generation: Challenges and Solutions for Child Online Protection” at an event in Lalitpur on Friday.The paper, developed after reviewing over 160 research reports and consulting with experts in online child protection, outlines strategies to create a secure digital environment for Nepali children.The launch event was attended by Nawal Kishore Sah Sudi, Minister for Women, Children, and Senior Citizens; Indra Devi Dhakal, Member Secretary of the National Child Rights Council; Jee Hyun Rah, UNICEF Nepal Representative; and Anil Raghuvanshi, founder of ChildSafeNet.Themed “A Safer Digital World: Navigating Risks, Safeguarding Children,” the event emphasised the importance of plans and policies to ensure safe internet usage for children. Participants included children, government officials, advocates, and media representatives.Minister Sah Sudi reaffirmed the government’s commitment to child online safety. “We are dedicated to creating a secure digital space for children through policy reforms, enforcement mechanisms, and education campaigns,” he said.UNICEF’s Jee Hyun Rah highlighted the dual nature of internet exposure, stating, “While the internet offers immense opportunities, it also exposes children to significant risks like cyberbullying, sexual abuse, and identity theft. This situation demands urgent collective action.”The event featured a panel discussion, where child representative Abhinay Chauhan questioned key stakeholders, including Anil Raghuvanshi and Indra Devi Dhakal, about their efforts to combat online threats.Raghuvanshi stressed the need for increased budgets to educate children and combat issues like cyber exploitation and hate speech, while panellists committed to making the digital world safer.The discussion also touched on the growing role of generative AI in worsening online risks, further underscoring the urgency of addressing digital safety for children. \nThe Supreme Court has shattered yet another attempt by the CPN (Maoist Centre) to institutionalise its “people’s war”.A year after “scrapping” the decision of the erstwhile Pushpa Kamal Dahal-led government to announce a public holiday to mark the launch of the Maoists’ decade-long “people’s war’ in 1996, the top court has issued an order not to use ‘janayuddha’ in government documents.Issuing an interim order in a writ petition filed by Advocate Gyanendra Aran, the Constitutional Bench has directed the federal and Madhesh provincial governments not to use it until the final verdict. Aran, who also is a victim of the Maoist insurgency, had challenged the government's decision to include the term in official documents, saying it had glorified the killings and violence.The text of the ruling from last week was made public on Thursday.The national budget presented by Barshaman Pun, finance minister in the erstwhile Dahal government, on May 28 for the current fiscal year mentions “people’s war”. Similarly, the Madhesh Province’s fiscal budget for 2024-25 also mentions the term. The court says that the use of “people’s war” is against the spirit of the preamble of the Constitution of Nepal and its Article 42 (5). Instead of “people’s war”, the Article uses ‘armed conflict’ to refer to the Maoist insurgency. A five-member bench led by Chief Justice Prakash Man Singh Raut also cited how the Constitutional Committee of the Constituent Assembly on January 3, 2010, had rejected the terminology proposal.During eight years of constitution drafting, the Maoist Centre invested all its effort to put the term into the constitution. However, the former insurgents were unsuccessful as the rest of the parties stood against it. It took several sittings and days for the parties to agree that the issues which cannot be decided with consensus would be put to a vote.The “people's war” was one such contentious issue that was put to vote but was rejected by the majority. ‘Armed conflict’ has been in official use to indicate the 1996-2006 insurgency. The Maoist Centre leadership has spoken against the top court’s ruling saying that banning the term is against the democratic spirit.“I heard you [people’s war] are banned; perhaps they want to lock you in a cold cellar knowing that you are a spokesperson for social justice,” Janardan Sharma, a Maoist Centre’s deputy general secretary, wrote on Facebook. “A ban is a mockery of democracy. The people’s war—you have been banned.”Now the same constitutional bench will conduct final hearing on the case before passing a verdict. This is the second time in a year the top court shot down the attempt of the third largest party to institutionalise “people's war”.On December 28 last year, the Supreme Court annulled the government’s decision to declare Falgun 1 a public holiday as the ‘People's War Day’.A division bench of justices Anand Mohan Bhattarai and Mahesh Sharma Paudel had quashed the government’s decision on a public holiday while responding to a writ petition by various individuals, including Advocate Aran.The government in February 2023 had announced a public holiday to commemorate the ‘People’s War Day’ despite reservations from a coalition partner. The Rastriya Prajatantra Party then refused to attend the Cabinet meeting, expressing displeasure with the decision.The rebellion that started on February 13, 1996, concluded following a Comprehensive Peace Agreement on November 21, 2006.The Maoists, who led the insurgency, observe the first day of the Nepali month of Falgun as the People’s War Day every year. However, other political forces see the marking of the day as a public holiday as a glorification of the conflict—and hence unacceptable. \nEven if CPN-UML is leading the government, its eyes appear to be trained on the upcoming election.While some political analysts argue that the party should be more focussed on delivering from its position of power, others say it should be taken as natural for a political party in a democracy.After facing poor results during the by-elections held earlier this month, the party recently passed six resolutions aiming to become the largest in the 2027 general elections.The resolutions were passed during a two-day workshop in Kathmandu that concluded on Sunday and was attended by in-charges, presidents, and secretaries of provincial, district, and fraternal organisations. The workshop aimed to make the party organisation more dynamic and connect with the people.Aiming to give the party decisive political power, it has also announced a three-month campaign at the ward level starting on January 16.The workshop concluded that although UML hopes to become the largest party through the 2027 elections, the party committees, in their current form, were ineffective and not well-positioned to achieve that goal. The workshop also decided to intensify the organisation-strengthening campaign.All these moves indicate that the UML is currently more focussed on the 2027 elections than on governing.Political historian Rajesh Gautam finds it unnatural that instead of focusing on delivery and addressing the growing public disenchantment towards political parties, the ruling political party is focusing on the next election.“What makes one believe that political parties that have failed to deliver good governance at present will do so after the next election?” Gautam questions.Gautam stressed that since political parties do not have a specific plan and vision, they are making lofty plans to engage their cadres.The UML came in second in the local and federal elections held in 2022. For a brief time, the party was also in the government led by CPN (Maoist Centre) chair Pushpa Kamal Dahal, formed soon after the November 2022 federal and provincial elections.However, when the Maoist Centre changed its coalition partner, joining hands with the Nepali Congress, the UML was relegated to the opposition party at both the federal and provincial governments. But the party got back in power on March 4, first collaborating with the Maoist Centre as a coalition partner and later with Congress, following the July 1 midnight agreement.Whether in the government or the opposition, the UML’s focus appears to lie on the upcoming election.Chandra Dev Bhatta, a political analyst, says that a political party focusing on the upcoming election should be taken as natural; it is their long-term political plan.“Since the election result 2022 delivered a hung Parliament, no political party can single-handedly lead the government now,” Bhatta said. “Political parties are focussing on the upcoming election to avoid that situation.”After the UML realised that its strength was diminishing after conducting the mid-hill highway-centric political campaign last year, it is now giving its full attention to strengthening its party organisation, Bhatta said. The party had expected a positive result in the just-concluded local-level by-election; however, the result was contrary to its expectations, which forced it to focus rigorously on the upcoming election.“But it is not only the UML that is concentrating on the next election,” Bhatta added. “Other major political parties like Congress and Maoist Centre are also organising various programmes aimed at the next election.”The UML had launched a mid-hill highway-centric political campaign in December last year, aiming to interact with the local communities in 26 districts connected by the highway. UML then organised 30 mass assemblies and interacted with locals through over 100 gatherings during the two-week-long tour.The campaign, which started in Jhulaghat of Baitadi on December 1, concluded 17 days later when it reached Chiwabhanjyang in the far-eastern part of the country.Before this, in February 2023, UML also organised a ‘Mission Grassroots’ campaign to strengthen the party's ideological organisation, which was also focused on the next election. If every political party focuses on the upcoming election, what will become of the current people’s mandate delivered through the 2022 election?“When political parties are not ideologically bound, they are permanently looking forward to the next election,” said CK Lal, another political expert. “This is what’s currently happening in Nepal.”Lal further said that when political parties fail to improve their performances, their only motive is to win the election based on their organisational strength.But Jhalak Subedi, a political analyst, says that consolidating the party's strength is a regular political process that has nothing to do with the earlier election mandate.Political parties might have felt a gap in connecting with the public, so they plan different campaigns to connect with the public, Subedi says. “These campaigns should not be considered otherwise.” \nPreparations are on to call the winter session of the federal parliament from the first week of January, amid the opposition's claims that the government wants to push back the session.Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli, Speaker Devraj Ghimire, and Minister for Law, Justice and Parliamentary Affairs Ajay Chaurasiya held informal discussions on Friday to take stock of the bills that may be presented before lawmakers. The budget session of Parliament was prorogued on September 17, weeks before the major festival began, without enough bills to work on. “Discussions are ongoing to ensure the upcoming session has adequate business. We want the House committees to finalise some of the bills while the government will also register new bills by the time the new session commences,” Chaurasiya told the Post. As per the records at the parliament secretariat, 20 bills are with the parliamentary committees.Several of them have been pending for over a year as the committees failed to finalise them. Five bills are under consideration in the Finance Committee, while the State Affairs and Good Governance Committee has four bills to decide on. Similarly, the Infrastructure Development Committee; the Education, Health and Information Committee; and the Law, Justice and Human Rights Committee have at least one bill each to discuss and finalise.At least twice in the last two months, Ghimire has asked the chairpersons of the committees under the House of Representatives and the National Assembly, in the presence of the party chief whips, to finalise the bills and send them to the full House. However, the committees have not finalised a single bill so far. Chauriya said there will be no dearth of business if the committees pass some pending bills while the government will also register some new ones. The government has not registered any bills since July. “Our ministry is reviewing different bills drafted by various ministries,” said Chaurasiya, the parliamentary affairs minister. Draft bills related to splitting of the Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal, integrated election laws, and amendments to the Nepal Police Act, among others, are under consideration.The Cabinet must endorse the bills drafted by various ministries before being registered in Parliament. Such bills are first discussed in the full House and then sent to the respective committees to streamline the amendments. They must get through both chambers and receive the presidential seal before becoming a law.Officials at the parliament secretariat say the government is under pressure to summon an early session amid fears that the opposition could demand a special session. “We have heard that the opposition might demand a special session, claiming the government wants to push back the winter session,” said a senior official at the secretariat. “However, to my knowledge, there have been discussions between the government and the Speaker for the new session. It should start in a few weeks.”Speaking at a party event last week, Dahal claimed that the Oli government was unwilling to call the winter session because it was afraid of facing criticism. The main opposition is looking for a platform to criticise the government, claiming it was promoting corruption and shielding the corrupt. Similarly, the Rastriya Swatantra Party, which says the government was targeting its president by prolonging his corruption trial, too is waiting for the opportunity to attack the government.One fourth of lawmakers of the 275-strong lower house can petition the President for a special session of Parliament.The last winter session commenced on February 5. The President summons and prorogues Parliament on the government’s recommendation. There cannot be a gap bigger than six months between two sessions.Several bills have yet to be passed for a full-fledged implementation of the new constitution. A subpanel under the Legislation Management Committee of the National Assembly reported that the government still needs to prepare 39 bills. The five-member subpanel led by Beduram Bhusal has accused successive governments of paying little attention to making legal arrangements necessary for the charter’s full implementation. Seven governments led by the Nepali Congress, the CPN-UML and the CPN (Maoist Centre) have been formed since the promulgation of the constitution in 2015. \nAs various ethnic groups raising their voice for identity-based nomenclature of Koshi Province prepare to resume their agitation, the provincial government is considering holding talks with them.The provincial government has formed a talks team weeks after the groups dissatisfied with the province’s nomenclature announced a ‘new and decisive’ agitation.On November 18, the Province 1 Renaming Joint Struggle Committee had held a press conference to announce the movement.Nearly a month later, on Thursday, the provincial government formed a three-member dialogue committee led by Minister for Economic Affairs and Planning Ram Bahadur Magar. Internal Affairs and Law Minister Rewati Raman Bhandari and Minister for Physical Infrastructure Development Bhupendra Rai are its members while the secretary of the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Law serves as its member-secretary.A provincial assembly meeting had named Province 1 as Koshi on March 1 last year. The name, proposed by the CPN-UML, was endorsed by an overwhelming majority, with assembly members from the Nepali Congress, the CPN (Maoist Centre), and the Rastriya Prajatantra Party (RPP) voting in its favour.But the nomenclature did not sit well with various ethnic groups that had been demanding the province be named after the ethnic identity of the dominant communities residing in the province. The groups then took to the streets against the nomenclature.Amid this, on December 8, members of the struggle committee tried to show a black flag, as a symbolic protest, to Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli while he was visiting his home district of Jhapa.Minister for Internal Affairs and Law Bhandari said that there are various issues related to community, identity and ethnicity that have emerged in the province and may arise in the future as well. “The dialogue committee will find solutions to these issues through negotiations in line with the constitution and laws,” he said.The dialogue team has yet to start its work. As Sunday is a public holiday, the committee is likely to hold a formal meeting with the agitating groups on Monday, Bhandari said.“We can talk jointly or separately with different groups—it will be determined by the terms of reference (ToR) that our committee formulates,” Minister Bhandari added. “At present, at least eight to nine groups are protesting by taking up identity issues.”The agitating groups have also been demanding that Maithili be designated the official language of the province, Minister Bhandari said.But Govinda Chhantyal, an identity-based rights activist, differs with the minister. “The identity movement has been raising the issue of language long before the issue of naming the Koshi emerged,” he said.“While the government recognised 12 official languages, Limbu and Maithili were recognised as the official languages ​​of Koshi Province,” Chhantyal added. “We have since then been linking the language issue with the identity movement.”In 2021, the language commission submitted its report to then President Bidya Devi Bhandari and then Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba, recommending 12 languages, including Nepali, as official languages.Koshi Provincial Assembly member from Nepali Congress Shamsher Rai emphasises the importance of resolving outstanding issues through dialogue. The previous government held talks with the agitating groups twice. Although the talks had progressed positively, the change of government at the centre and the province later affected them, Rai said.“Both sides should opt for dialogue,” Rai said.Prem Yakten, coordinator of the struggle committee accused the current provincial government of ignoring the problem.“If the government ignores our movement, we will intensify it in other provinces too,” coordinator Yatken said. “The main agenda of our protest is to rename the Koshi Province.”Soon after the provincial assembly named the province as Koshi, the agitating groups started disruptive activities. Authorities had to announce prohibitory orders in the province for a few days.Upon reaching an agreement on February 9 with the Kedar Karki-led government, the agitating groups had halted their protests. They later contested in the subsequent by-election held in Ilam-2.In the April by-election held to elect a federal lawmaker from Ilam-2, two activists of the Province-1 Renaming Joint Struggle Committee—Dakendra Limbu and Milan Limbu—contested the seats. Dakendra fought as an independent candidate while Milan contested as a candidate from the Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP). Dakendra secured third position with 11,457 votes; CPN-UML’s Suhang Nemwang, the son of former Speaker late Subas Nembang, won the election.“The by-election held earlier this year boosted our confidence and the election result justified our movement,” Yakten said.“We had reached a five-point agreement with the Kedar Karki-led government,” Yakten said. “The government’s dialogue committee had then agreed to take political initiatives to resolve the issue of renaming the Koshi Province.” According to him, the provincial government had agreed to fund the treatment of those injured during the agitation and compensate the families of those who died in it.“The government committee had vowed to start the process of releasing those in prison and withdrawing cases of those charged of vandalism,” Yakten said. “But none of the agreements were implemented, compelling us to hit the street again.”Yakten says that they have come up with an alternative name for the province.“Earlier, supporters of identity-based nomenclature had suggested alternate names for the Bagmati Province and Gandaki Province as well but they were ignored,” Yakten added. “Even now, they accuse us of not having an alternative name. We have it but we won’t make it public until the government is ready to change the name.” \nThe Kathmandu Metropolitan City has announced that it will start random on-the-spot emission testing of vehicles on the road beginning next week.The move of the city office comes amid deteriorating air quality in Kathmandu Valley.“We have provided necessary training to two mechanical engineers, who will be deployed for emission testing,” said Jagatman Shrestha, traffic expert adviser at the metropolis. “We have also coordinated with the environment department of the federal government, traffic police, and the department of transport management to start these tests.”The city office has purchased two smoke meters (a portable device for testing vehicle emissions)—one for diesel vehicles and the other for petrol vehicles—to carry out emission testing. Officials say, for the first time, motorcycles and scooters will also be tested.Though vehicle emission testing is mainly the responsibility of federal government agencies, the constitution also mandates local governments to take measures to reduce pollution, officials say.The metropolis has developed pollution control guidelines as per the KMC Environment and Natural Resources Protection Act-2021.Officials say these random tests will be conducted on vehicles that have passed emission testing from the department of transport management and received green stickers, as all four-wheelers on the road typically do. However, some may still emit black smoke for various reasons, including lack of timely servicing and maintenance.Many automobile owners only service their vehicles ahead of the annual pollution testing. “We will not issue green stickers to vehicles but check emission levels,” said Shrestha. “If we find vehicles emitting pollutants more than permissible levels, we will slap a fine.”According to the officials, Rs1,000 will be fined for polluting vehicles for the first time.Random vehicle testing is among the measures the city office is taking to tackle air pollution.The municipal environment department has also started monitoring the city’s air quality independently. For that, the city office has installed portable devices in various locations. “We have already installed portable air quality monitoring devices in 16 locations within the metropolis and are preparing to install three more,” said Sarita Rai, chief of the department. “We have also launched a drive to make people aware of air pollution.”Nepal’s air quality reaches hazardous levels several times a year, and the capital city often becomes the world’s most polluted metropolis.According to IQ AirVisual, a Swiss group that collects air quality data from around the world, Kathmandu’s PM2.5 levels reached 197 micrograms per cubic metre (μg/m3) on Friday afternoon.PM2.5 refers to particulate matter (solid or liquid droplets) in the air that is less than 2.5 micrometres in diameter. It is among the most dangerous pollutants that can get past the nose and throat to penetrate the lungs and get into the bloodstream. PM2.5 particles are small and likely to stay suspended in the air for long, increasing the chances of people inhaling them.As per the Environmental Protection Agency’s air quality index, when air quality reaches 151-200, it is considered unhealthy; everyone may experience problems, with sensitive groups feeling more severe effects.Major hospitals report a spike in respiratory problems due to the impact of toxic air and dust. Meanwhile, the city office said it had installed push-button traffic lights in 36 locations for the ease of pedestrians. “We are working to bring those devices into operation soon,” said Shrestha, traffic adviser of the metropolis. “Pedestrians can push the button to stop traffic and cross the road safely.”Push-button devices are installed at traffic intersections to allow pedestrians to request stop road traffic, so that they can cross the road without fear. \nNepali Congress candidate Krishnaman Dangol has been elected mayor of Kirtipur Municipality in the by-election held on Sunday. Dangol secured 5,334 votes, defeating his closest rival, Shivsharan Maharjan of the Maoist Centre, by 779 votes.Maharjan received 4,555 votes, while Surendra Manandhar of the CPN-UML garnered 4,337 votes.The by-election was held following the demise of former mayor Rajkumar Nakarmi, who passed away on July 26 last year due to a kidney-related illness. Nakarmi, also from the Congress, was elected Mayor in the 2022 local elections.Kirtipur, historically known as a left-leaning stronghold, saw a shift in political dynamics with Nakarmi’s victory in 2022. Kirtipur was declared a municipality in 1997. \nKrishnaman Dangol of the Nepali Congress has maintained a lead in the ongoing vote count for the mayor of Kirtipur Municipality. As of the latest tally, Dangol has garnered 789 votes, while Surendra Manandhar of the CPN-UML trails with 666 votes. Shivsharan Maharjan of the CPN (Maoist Centre) has received 465 votes. Among independent candidates, Rajman Maharjan has secured 418 votes, Dinesh Kumar Adhikari 236, and Kabikumar Maharjan 58. Rastriya Prajatantra Party’s Dhruba Maharjan has obtained 119 votes, while Bhanu Rijal of the CPN (Unified Socialist) has 22 votes.   \nRojina Shrestha of the Rastriya Swatantra Party has been elected ward chair of Kathmandu Metropolitan City-16, securing 2,902 votes.According to the Election Commission, Laxmiratna Tuladhar of the UML came second with 2,220 votes, while Congress candidate Devendra Pathak finished third with 2,214 votes. Unified Socialist’s Min Bahadur Manandhar received 1,092 votes, and Shyam Krishna Shrestha of the Rastriya Prajatantra Party secured 774 votes. A total of 10,558 votes were cast, with 180 declared invalid. The by-election was held following the death of Mukunda Rijal, elected ward chair in 2022 with 4,018 votes from Congress. \nA man accused of threatening Nepali businesspersons by claiming to be a member of the Indian criminal gang Lawrence Bishnoi, has been arrested. The arrested is Harichandra Phuyal alias Navin Pradhan, 36, a resident of Panchthar, and currently residing in ward 13 of Mechinagar Municipality, Jhapa.According to police, Phuyal used Indian phone numbers to make calls and send messages to businesspersons, claiming to represent the gang. He allegedly terrorised them by demanding they apologise to controversial medical entrepreneur Durga Prasai, warning of dire consequences, including threats to their lives. The Central Investigation Bureau (CIB) apprehended Pradhan in Charaali, Jhapa, on Wednesday evening. Police investigations revealed that Pradhan acted under Prasai’s instructions. Authorities said Pradhan has a history of criminal involvement and was previously on the run. Two mobile phones were seized during the arrest, and further investigation is ongoing.  \nIn Majhthana, a remote hill station in Kaski district, Chandra Kanta Ghimire, a returnee migrant, wakes up early to cook khole (a soup of maize flour and vegetables) to feed his buffaloes. He has minimal green fodder, so he supplements their diet with a mixture of dry straw.Ghimire owns 10 Murrah buffalos. These water buffaloes originate in Haryana and Punjab, India and are mainly known for producing a high volume of milk. Until recently, he had no idea about the buffalo meat export prospects.Eleven months ago, he took another Rs2.3 million loan and added more buffaloes. “I spent Rs600,000 to erect a shed and have decided to add two buffaloes this year.”Ghimire said that a Murrah buffalo costs around Rs170,000. “I milk 50 litres a day, making a monthly income of Rs147,000 by selling it at Rs115 per litre,” said Ghimire, who dreams of buying a car with the income in four or five years. The 51-year-old farmer recently bought a washing machine. Ghimire said he hasn’t considered rearing buffalo for meat. “But I have heard it’s rewarding,” Ghimire told the Post last month. Commercial buffalo rearing for meat purposes is limited in Nepal, and the export of buffalo meat is negligible. This week, on Monday, Beijing opened a trade prospect for the meat industry, apart from traditional handicraft products, which Nepal has been exporting to its northern neighbour for decades.During Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli’s recent visit to China on December 2, Beijing surprised Nepal by opening its doors to water buffalo meat. On social media platforms, many users pointed out that during then Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal’s trip to New Delhi in May, his counterpart gifted 15 Murrah buffaloes to Nepal, while Prime Minister Oli travelled to China and agreed to sell buffalo meat. But for Nepal’s ailing agricultural sector, this Chinese initiative represents a huge prospect and may significantly help the country’s graduation from least developed country (LDC). As per the statistics, if the buffalo meat export materialises, it could surpass the total export earnings from the 32 high-value goods identified by Nepal Trade Integration Strategy (NTIS), which totalled Rs110.38 billion in the last fiscal year. The trade strategy was revised last fiscal year to support Nepal’s graduation from the LDC status to a developing country by 2026.On December 16, Himalayan Food International, a private company in Nepal, and Shanghai Ziyan Food, a company in China, inked a business-to-business agreement in Kathmandu to export buffalo meat.“Immediately after the successful visit of Rt Hon PM and agreement on Buffalo meat export to China. The game-changing MOU of Strategic Cooperation for Nepal Thermally Processed Buffalo Meat Products Export Project to China is inked today, which has opened over 100 billion rupees in the buffalo farming industry in Nepal, benefitting tens of thousands of rural families. Congratulations to both our people,” Chinese Ambassador to Nepal Chen Song wrote on X.Beijing is employing soft trade diplomacy to buy $1.5 billion worth of buffalo meat from Nepal in a year, terming the project a game-changer.Experts say that’s a big opportunity for Nepal, whose annual export to China is Rs2.58 billion. The meat Beijing has sought from Nepal accounts for almost 66 percent of Nepal’s annual imports from China, which total $2.21 billion.But challenges galore.“China may offer technical help to build a processing facility for this purpose,” said Mahanand Joshi, a senior agri-economist at the Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock Development. “A Nepali private company will export $1.5 billion of buffalo meat annually, depending on Nepal’s production. The government will invest to increase buffalo production accordingly.” “To meet the target of $1.5 billion, we need to meet the technical standard for export, and work will be expedited for this purpose.”However, Nepal’s present buffalo population can’t even meet the high domestic market demands, and insiders say buffalos are brought in large numbers from India.The buffalo meat industry of Nepal is still experiencing a market gap due to the demand-supply mismatch. The Beijing initiative opens new opportunities for entrepreneurs to fill the gap.The total meat production in Nepal peaked at 552,156 tonnes in 2019-20 due to the Covid pandemic, when people started to take an extra protein diet to fight the virus.However, production gradually dropped to 520,742 tonnes in 2020-21 and 512,788 tonnes in 2021-22. The production fell sharply to 430,085 tonnes in 2022-23, which experts attributed to an exodus of Nepali youth, the key population who loved eating meat. Government statistics show that labour permits and student visas were issued for nearly a million Nepalis in 2022-23. Buffalo meat, which represents 27 percent of total meat production in Nepal and has 20.23 grams of protein content per 100 grams, higher than other types of meat, rose to 189,517 tonnes in 2019-20. Production fell to 188,172 tonnes in 2020-21 and peaked at a time high of 194,090 tonnes in 2021-22. The output then shrank to a nearly two-and-a-half-decade low of 116,503 tonnes in 2022-23.The population of live buffalos, which was 3.70 million heads two decades ago, reached 5.30 million heads in 2018-19, the highest count. But since, the population has decreased, reaching a three-decade low of 3.08 million heads in 2022-23.Government officials see the Beijing initiative as a game changer for Nepal’s livestock sector.Sudhir Kumar Singh, information officer at the Department of Livestock Services, believes Nepal can meet the Chinese demand.“As demand for buffalo meat has declined, farmers too were discouraged. But if there is a trade prospect, commercial farming may thrive again.”Livestock traders say it is a day-dream. “Domestic production is not enough to meet domestic demand. We estimate that nearly 70 percent of buffaloes in Nepal are imported from India illegally to meet the buff demand,” said Jiban Khatiwada, president of the Nepal Livestock Traders Association. “In this scenario, immediately exporting buffalo meat in such a large amount is impossible.” Ghimire, the farmer in Kaski, says he didn’t import buffaloes from India. “A group of agents smuggle them. It’s not possible to bring Murrah buffalos from India legally.”Nepal has become self-reliant in goat and chicken production but not in buffalo.However, Navin Kumar Sharma, chairman of Himalayan Food International, is optimistic about the ambitious agreement. “But it will take some time.”“It is feasible to export $1.5 billion worth of buffalo meat to China by 2027-28 if we aggressively start rearing buffalo. We will start exporting 500 tonnes, as per our target. For this, we need to slaughter 5,000 buffaloes daily,” said Sharma.Chinese investors will put in Rs27 billion in two projects. Investment of Rs21 billion will be mobilised for buffalo rearing in three locations: Hariharpur Gadhi in Sindhuli, Ilam and Madi of Chitwan. Similarly, under the project, a Rs6 billion processing plant will be set up in Hariharpur Gadhi. Chinese investors are scheduled to inspect the factory in six months.“So, by the time they come, we must keep 40,000 buffalo calves. The Chinese investors have given us a target of rearing 200,000 buffalo heads in a year,” said Sharma. “We have to ensure that the buffalo meat originates in Nepal, but we will be exempted from the origin certificate for the first two years.”Sharma said he was exporting buffalo meat to Vietnam until the pre-Covid period, which then used to be re-exported to China. Buffalo is being produced primarily in Tarai areas. It takes two years for a calf to become mature for meat production.Khatiwada said people rear buffalo for milk, but as buffalo milk production is low, farmers focused on milk production have shifted to cow rearing. Also, it is comparatively easier to rear cows than buffaloes.Khatiwada said any increase in production depends on the government’s policy. “Once buffalo meat starts being exported to China, its price will rise domestically due to the push in demand. This might also encourage more farmers to start buffalo rearing,” he said.“But whatever the case, this project is undeniably ambitious.” \n**Summarize the major events in 1 line without losing crucial information.**\nCash-strapped Dairy Development Corporation signs agreement to supply raw cheese to private company for cash flow amid financial struggles.\nThe MG Winter Carnival 2024 at Silver Oak, Baluwatar, Kathmandu, will showcase luxury automobiles from MG, Mazda, Maxus, and Wuling, offering exclusive exchange offers, financing options, test drives, and live entertainment.\nNepal confirms second monkeypox case, a 36-year-old migrant worker who returned from Saudi Arabia, leading to contact tracing efforts.\nNepal postpones malaria elimination target to 2030 due to ineffective containment efforts and isolated indigenous cases emerging as a major challenge.\nNepal received 460,940 doses of HPV vaccine for a nationwide vaccination drive to reduce cervical cancer, with 1.7 million doses required for the first phase starting February 5th.\nA few days ago, a five-year-old boy from Kathmandu was rushed to the emergency ward of the Kanti Children's Hospital for a respiratory illness. Doctors said the boy had been suffering from an acute lower tract infection, decreased lung function, and asthma.“Respiratory viruses, including influenza and others, become more active during the winter season,” said Dr Sumit Agrawal, the hospital spokesperson. “The rise in the air pollution levels has further exacerbated the problems.”This has become a common refrain among the hundreds of children suffering from respiratory illness, as the air quality in the country continues to decline.Doctors say respiratory viruses—influenza A(H1N1), A(H3), influenza B, rhinovirus, coronaviruses, and adenoviruses, among others—are generally more active during winter. But what alarmed them is that studies show children in Kathmandu Valley are highly exposed to air pollution, which could worsen respiratory and other problems.A recent study carried out by the Nepal Health Research Council shows that children in Kathmandu Valley have been highly exposed to air pollution.“They are exposed to air pollution while commuting to and from school,” said Dr Megnath Dhimal, chief researcher at the Council. “Those travelling by scooter to and from school are at risk even more.”According to the report, KN95 masks block 50 to 70 percent of pollution particles, but most children do not wear these masks. Parents, too, are often not aware of the risks. Moreover, children do not know how to wear face masks properly.With the start of the dry season, air quality, mostly in highly dense cities, including the Kathmandu Valley, has been worsening. IQ AirVisual, a Swiss group that collects air-quality data from around the world, has ranked Kathmandu among the world’s 10 most polluted cities several times in recent days. PM2.5 refers to particulate matter (solid or liquid droplets) in the air that is less than 2.5 micrometres in diameter. It is among the most dangerous pollutants that can get past the nose and throat to penetrate the lungs and even the bloodstream. PM2.5 particles are small and are also likely to stay suspended in the air for long, increasing the chances of people inhaling them.Doctors say poor air quality can cause short- and long-term effects on public health. In the short term, it can lead to pneumonia, bronchitis, conjunctivitis, skin allergy, stroke, and heart problems, and in the long run, it can lead to severe conditions like ulcers, cancer of the lungs and intestine, kidney disease, and heart complications.“The increase in the sale of inhalers and nebulisers for children is also a clear sign of how serious the problem has become,” said Dr Ganesh Rai, former director at the Kanti Children Hospital. “The number of cases of respiratory illness in children has risen by 50 percent in the last 10 years and 100 percent in 20 years.”Studies show people in low- and middle-income countries get disproportionately affected by polluted air, which is responsible for more than 90 percent of deaths in these countries, according to the World Health Organisation.Several studies carried out in the past in Nepal also showed that toxic air takes a huge toll on public health. Along with respiratory illness, the toxic air has led to severe conditions like ulcers, cancer of the lungs and intestine, kidney disease, heart complications, high blood pressure and stroke, according to experts.Past studies also show that polluted air has been shortening people’s lives. Nepali lives are being cut short by around five years, according to a report by the Air Quality Life Index (AQLI), which converts air pollution concentration into an impact on life expectancy. AQLI is a metric produced by the Energy Policy Institute at the University of Chicago.Toxic air is deadlier than tobacco use and high blood pressure, which reduce life by 2.8 years and 1.7 years, respectively, according to the report.Public health measures—mask-wearing, handwashing, avoiding crowds, and maintaining social distancing—can reduce infection, according to doctors. \nAs the deadline to eliminate malaria approaches, cases of new infections—both indigenous and imported—have risen alarmingly in Nepal.Nepal had committed to achieving ‘malaria-free’ status by 2026. For this, the country needs to bring down indigenous cases or local transmission to zero, achieve zero deaths starting from 2023, and maintain zero indigenous cases for three consecutive years.However, the country has failed to bring down indigenous cases to zero in both 2023 and 2024.Instead, cases of infections–both Indigenous and imported have risen alarmingly, which shattered any prospects of eliminating the disease within the deadline.“Only 16 cases of local transmission or indigenous cases were confirmed in 2023, but we already have more than 20 cases this year,” said Dr Gokarna Dahal, chief of the Vector Control Section at the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division. “We had 649 imported cases in 2023, but in 2024, the number could reach 1,000.”Malaria is caused by Plasmodium parasites. Infected female Anopheles mosquitoes carry these deadly parasites, according to the World Health Organisation. Indigenous malaria cases are locally transmitted, meaning the infected person does not have a history of travel to a malaria-affected country. Officials say that the number of indigenous cases of malaria infection could rise further, as concerned health authorities have been verifying the reports.“Now, it is impossible to meet the malaria elimination target, as we could not stop local transmission,” said Dr Yadu Chandra Ghimire, director of the division. “The new deadline for disease elimination could be 2030, the final deadline set by the UN health body.”Officials say that open borders, budget cuts in the health sector, and mosquitoes moving to higher altitudes due to climate change have hindered Nepal’s malaria elimination goal.They say that of the total imported cases, over 80 percent came from India. Some cases were imported from African countries. Nepali security personnel serving in UN peacekeeping missions in conflict-hit African countries also get tested positive for malaria.Officials say the disease is unlikely to be eliminated in Nepal unless India eliminates it first. They say that due to proximity, and an open and porous border between Nepal and India and unregulated travel of people of both countries, it is impossible to eliminate malaria in Nepal, until the disease gets eradicated in the southern neighbour.Several other factors, including cuts in the health budgets of government and aid agencies and shifts in vectors transmitting malaria to the hills and mountains due to global warming, also pose serious challenges to meeting the elimination target. Apart from this, most health facilities across the country lack entomologists, who are necessary for conducting surveillance. Malaria has also been reported in mountain districts of Mugu, Bajura, and Humla, which were considered non-endemic in the past. Officials say carrying out surveillance in the hill and mountain districts is more challenging than in the Tarai districts due to geographical difficulties.According to Health Ministry officials improved surveillance measures could be a reason for the detection of more cases of infections.Malaria-related deaths had stopped since 2016, but five years later, in 2021, the country recorded one death from the disease.Officials at the health ministry said that until recent years, Plasmodium Vivax, a protozoan parasite, had been responsible for most of the malaria cases in the country, which caused relatively less severe diseases. However, cases of Plasmodium falciparum, which most often cause severe and life-threatening malaria, have been rising. The parasite is common in many countries in Africa and the Sahara desert. \nThe Kathmandu Metropolitan City (KMC) has imposed a fine of Rs200,000 on Bhatbhateni Supermarket in Tripureshwar for selling substandard products. The Department of Agriculture and Livestock, under KMC, found mold in packaged food items during an inspection prompted by customer complaints.Dr Awadhesh Jha, an inspection officer from the department, stated that the KMC call centre received complaints alleging the sale of “expired, rotten, and pest-infested food” at the store. Following the inspection, 44 packets of coconuts were found to contain mold, leading to their destruction on Friday and the subsequent fine imposed on the supermarket.In an official statement, KMC emphasised the importance of adhering to food safety regulations, saying, “The penalty amount must be deposited into the city’s revenue account. Moving forward, ensure that all items sold comply with Nepal’s laws and maintain high-quality standards fit for consumption.” \nNepal Foods has been named Best Nepali Brand of the Year 2024 at the 9th Asian Food and Restaurant Awards International, held at the Royal Ascot. The event recognised excellence in the culinary industry, celebrating cultural diversity and innovation.The awards are known for highlighting outstanding contributions to the UK’s food sector. Nepal Foods’ achievement reflects its commitment to quality and authenticity in Nepalese cuisine.Bikash Nepal, Director of Nepal Foods, expressed pride in receiving the award, stating, “This recognition celebrates our efforts to promote Nepali culture and cuisine globally. It’s a testament to the dedication of our team.”With products available in the USA, Canada, Australia, Europe, and Japan, Nepal Foods continues to showcase Nepali gastronomy on an international stage. \nDusit Princess Kathmandu is organising a five-day trout festival at its SOI restaurant. The dishes will be available for order from 12:30 pm to 10:00 pm every day till August 30. In celebration of Nepal’s rivers and lakes, which provide an ideal environment for high-quality trout, the Director of Culinary Food and Beverage Service, Chef Utpal Mondal, and his team at Dusit Princess Kathmandu have crafted a menu showcasing the flavours and versatility of locally sourced trout. “As the festive month of Shrawan ends, people focus on healthy and nutritious food. Trout, rich in omega-3 fatty acids, vitamins, and essential minerals, offers a heart-friendly option that checks all the boxes from a nutritional and culinary standpoint,” says Mondal.He adds that the goal of the culinary event is to offer their guests a rare opportunity to experience a wide variety of trout dishes they wouldn’t typically find at home.The event menu features twelve unique dishes, six of which are drawn from diverse culinary traditions across continents. Three dishes are inspired by oriental cuisine, while the remaining three highlight flavours from Nepal and India. The menu has been designed to include various dishes, from soups and starters to main courses, including Mexican, Italian, Continental, and Thai flavours.While discussing the event’s highlights, Mondal said, “The celebration presents a unique opportunity for guests to indulge in a diverse range of trout-based dishes, something they wouldn’t typically have the chance to experience elsewhere.” \nI can vividly remember my first encounter with baking when I was 10 years old. We had just moved to our new home and got a cable connection. The cable opened a world of possibilities, as it gave me access to various contents.This was back in the late 2000s when YouTube would take hours to load, taunting us with its buffering screen. I was particularly drawn to travel and lifestyle channels, mainly TLC, Fox Life, and Food Network, which kept me informed about different foods and cultures. I don’t know why, but I was always drawn to desserts. It was fascinating to see how these miraculous treats made people smile at the end of the meal.Growing up in Nepal, I noticed that baking wasn't very common. While some families did have ovens, they were mostly multifunctional ones used primarily for heating food.I also noticed that most of our desserts didn't require an oven, as they could be made on a stovetop. So, you can imagine my excitement when my mom decided to buy an oven during one of her festive shopping sprees.I could finally feel the joy these channels portrayed. (I blame food writer Nigella Lawson for getting me hooked on a domestic lifestyle.) Then, one day, after watching one of the cooking episodes on television, I finally mustered enough strength and decided to bake something. I distinctly remember wanting to make a chocolate cake for myself after watching one of Rachel Allen’s bake series. I watched all the ingredients used in that recipe and scurried across my pantry, only to realise I didn’t have half of the stuff she mentioned. I then decided to improvise the recipe (a big mistake). I randomly combined the ingredients that I had in a mixing bowl and chucked the batter into my oven, hoping for a magical cake to pop out an hour later.After I saw the result an hour later, I was mortified. The cake was stuck in the pan, refusing to come out, and it was as dense as fudge. I convinced myself that the taste was what mattered most, but when I served a slice to my brother, he made a face of utter disgust.That was the day I realised that baking soda was not the same as baking powder.After this incident, I researched baking and found out it was technical. This was a blessing in disguise for me, as I loved science, and I started to view baking as a science experiment. I then reflected and evaluated how to perfect one's baking skills.I analysed my errors and noted down all the steps I did every time I baked. Home baking is a passion for many. The idea of turning a few simple ingredients into a delicious masterpiece is as enchanting as it sounds.Yet, for many of us, this seemingly magical process can often turn into a series of unfortunate events, leading to crumbled dreams and deflated ambitions. Dense cakes, burnt crusts, rock-hard cookies and unrisen bread, if you are an amateur baker, then you have seen it all. But why do these mishaps happen so often? And most importantly how do we overcome them?From my experience, behind every successful bake lies a series of challenges and mishaps that test even the most dedicated bakers. Baking has its own set of rules that you need to follow to get that scrumptious treat every time. So, to transform a recipe into an actual dish that will impress your friends and family, I am sharing with you some of the tips and tricks I learned from my tumultuous journey as a home baker.First things first, we have to look into the prime appliance that we are working with. Commercial ovens are of two types: one that runs on gas and the other that runs on electricity. We have to look at the oven present at our home and consider its pros and cons. The main benefits of a gas oven are its size and temperature control. One can quickly change the temperature just by twisting the knob, and it preheats much more quickly than an electric one. However, they are known to have uneven temperatures at times and release more humidity, making it harder to properly crisp or brown food. This can result in burnt edges and cold or hot spots. An electric oven, on the other hand, provides more even and consistent temperatures and doesn’t release as much moisture in the air.This dry oven environment makes it easier to brown your items, making it great for baking bread. However, while the dry oven results in more even cooking, you also run the risk of drying out cakes and other baked goods.Also, many people forget to preheat the oven before baking, which is crucial for maintaining an even temperature throughout the baking process. When baking cakes and bread, I like to place a small tray of water at the bottom of the oven to provide moisture and prevent the baked goods from drying out.An oven thermometer can be a baker's best friend, providing a true reading and ensuring your creations bake evenly. I also like rotating the pan midway while baking, as it allows for an even distribution of heat.The next thing people mess up on is measuring and the specificity of ingredients in a recipe. Our moms made our food with their instinct; it is something that they learned along the way, but when you are baking, you cannot instinctively add or omit a few steps.I think that is why we initially had problems with baking. In a culture where cooking comes instinctually, baking challenges us, to be precise. A gram of more or less of any ingredient can drastically alter the outcome. Different methods of measuring flour can yield different results.Every component in baking serves a distinct purpose and function. Flour offers structure, sugar adds sweetness and moisture, eggs bind things together, and butter enhances taste and texture. However, not all ingredients are created equally. For example, using salted butter instead of unsalted might change the taste profile of your meal.Similarly, different flours have varying protein concentrations, which affect the texture of baked goods. The type of sugar used also makes a difference. Granulated sugar, brown sugar, powdered sugar, and speciality sugars like turbinado or muscovado each add unique flavours to a bake.Understanding these nuances and how they interact is critical for getting the intended outcomes. Accurate measurement tools and techniques are essential, but mastering them can be a steep learning curve. So, I would recommend investing in a kitchen scale that allows for more accurate measurements by weight rather than volume.Moving on, leavening agents such as baking soda, baking powder, and yeast are required to make baked goods rise. However, they can also cause confusion and errors. Baking soda needs an acidic component to activate, but baking powder has both an acid and a base, making it self-activating.Using the wrong type of flour or sugar, or using them in incorrect proportions, can result in flat, overly raised, or collapsed cakes. Yeast, being a living organism, presents its challenges.The water temperature must be just right—not too hot to kill the yeast, nor too cold to inhibit its activity. Proofing times and conditions also need to be carefully managed to achieve the perfect rise.Bakers should also be careful about the way they mix ingredients. The method of mixing ingredients can significantly impact the final product. Over-mixing can develop too much gluten in cakes and pastries, leading to tough textures.Under-mixing can leave pockets of unincorporated ingredients, resulting in uneven bakes. Techniques like folding, creaming, and whipping each serve specific purposes and must be executed with care.Finally, home bakers must understand the importance of timing and patience in baking. Even a minute or two can make the difference between perfectly baked cookies and burnt edges.Recipes often provide a range for baking times, but factors like oven hot spots, pan material, and altitude can affect these times. It’s crucial to keep a close eye on your bakes and rely on visual and tactile cues, such as a cake pulling away from the sides of the pan or a toothpick coming out clean, to determine doneness.Baking is also an exercise in patience, a virtue not everyone possesses. Doughs need time to rest and rise, flavours need time to meld, and baked goods need time to cool before they can be enjoyed.Impatience can lead to underbaked centres, crumbling slices, and a general sense of frustration. Cultivating patience is as important as mastering any technique in the baker’s repertoire.Home baking is a journey full of ups and downs, but it comes with great rewards. The obstacles encountered teach valuable lessons in patience, precision, and perseverance.The satisfaction of success, the freedom to create, and the therapeutic benefits make the endeavour meaningful. Whether baking for oneself, loved ones, or as an artistic outlet, the journey is as fulfilling as the result. Embrace the flour-dusted countertops, occasional setbacks, and the joys of home bakingFor a beginner-friendly recipe that involves mixing ingredients and delivers amazing results, try my recipe for fudgy, nutty brownies that I call ‘Bliss Brownies’.Bliss Brownies150g unsalted butter plus extra for the tin150g chopped dark chocolate200g caster sugar½ tsp baking powder2 eggs80g cocoa powder150g plain flour70g mixture of nuts (walnuts and almonds)60g blended papayaMix all the ingredients (except the dark chocolate and nuts) in a blender or a food processor and blitz till you get a smooth paste.Fold the chocolate and the nuts into the brownie batter, making sure that the pieces are evenly mixed in.Grease a loaf pan with soft butter and dust with cocoa powder. Pour the batter into the loaf pan.Bake in a preheated oven at 170c for 40 minutes and let it cool in the oven for an hour. Enjoy with a cup of coffee or, as I like it, a scoop of vanilla ice cream. \nIn a world where acceptance and safety often seem difficult to attain, many queer individuals also struggle to find a safe space to express themselves. They have to hide their true self and face relentless judgement when going to public places like cafes and restaurants.This is the reality for countless LGBTQIA+ individuals. The need for a safe space for this community is not just a desire but a necessity—a space where one can be themselves. This struggle for safety and acceptance can be traced to crucial historical moments, such as the Stonewall Riots of 1969 in New York City.The Stonewall Inn was more than a bar; it was a refuge for the queer community. When police raided the bar, the community fought back. This series of violent confrontations, which began in the early hours of June 28, 1969, between police and gay rights activists, marked the beginning of the modern LGBTQIA+ rights movement. The spirit of Stonewall, the fight for dignity and the right to exist openly lives on in places like Inclusive Galaxy Restaurant in Kathmandu. Inclusive Galaxy beyond a restaurant is an ‘oasis’ for the queer community and beyond.Founded by Bishwaraj Adhikari, Mr Gay Handsome Nepal 2013, a human rights defender, the restaurant proves the power of safe spaces. It’s a place where the community can unite, free from the prejudice and hostility that often permeate their everyday lives.After years of working in the human rights sector, Adhikari and his partner developed the idea for Inclusive Galaxy. What began as a small cafe gradually evolved into a full-fledged restaurant, driven by the growing demand and support from the community.“In developed countries with strong LGBTQIA+ movements, you can find community areas like gay villages. These are created as safe spaces for people whose families and communities have excluded them. They also support new business ideas and pink tourism. I hope to see pink tourism develop in Nepal someday,” says Adhikari. His vision for Inclusive Galaxy goes beyond just being a restaurant. He aims to promote financial independence and empowerment within the queer community.Since its inception in February 2019, Inclusive Galaxy has become a key spot for many in Lazimpat, a relatively queer-friendly area in Kathmandu. The location is essential because the first LGBTQIA+ movement in Nepal started in 2001 through the Blue Diamond Society.Inclusive Galaxy, true to its name, welcomes everyone—queer and non-queer alike—to share a comfortable space. His vision was clear: to create a space where people of all genders and sexual identities could come together without fear of exclusion.“I didn’t want to make it exclusively for queer people because that would be excluding ourselves from society. Different groups need to live together and understand each other,” Adhikari explains.In the early days, the cafe attracted both queer and non-queer customers. However, when some of the residents learned about Adhikari’s identity and the nature of the clientele, there was a brief period of hesitation. “At first, I didn’t understand what was happening, but then I realised my identity was an issue for a few people. I believe people should be judged by others by their character, not by their gender or sexuality. Over time, as residents saw that we operated like any other cafe, they became more comfortable,” Adhikari reflects.Adhikari started Inclusive Galaxy to give queer individuals a place to be proud of themselves, counteracting the self-doubt and insecurity that hiding one’s identity can cause. This turned the cafe very quickly into a community hub. The journey was not without challenges, though. It was difficult to hire staff and cooks from the LGBTQIA+ community, and soon after the restaurant opened, the COVID pandemic made things even harder.Despite these difficulties, the doors of Inclusive Galaxy remained open. During the pandemic, many queer individuals, who were abandoned by their families or afraid to return home, found comfort at Inclusive Galaxy.Since many couldn’t afford to pay for meals, the restaurant provided free food from its resources. As the number of people needing meals grew to 20-30 daily, Adhikari started raising funds within the community.“During my time as an activist, many people came here not only for food but also to see an organisation where the queer community supports one another,” Adhikari says.“The time during COVID was difficult, but it brought me closer to the community.”Four years after its inception, the restaurant has garnered a loyal following. Sarosy Neupane, Miss Pink Nepal 2024 first runner-up, describes Inclusive Galaxy as her second home. She moved to Kathmandu to study in 2022. Being distant from her family, she started visiting Galaxy for meals that reminded her of home-cooked food. Over time, she grew attached to the café because of its welcoming atmosphere.“It’s heartwarming to see people from our community and different walks of life here. The founders even invite us to festivals like ‘Dahi Chiura Khane din,’” she shares.Neupane visits the cafe regularly and sometimes stays until 3 am, engrossed in conversations. “I hope more spaces like this can open in the future. If, unfortunately, this place were to close someday, I don’t think we’d have any other place to turn to,” she adds.Muna Chhetri, a trans woman who has been a loyal customer for three years, shares, “This is my safe space where I can truly be myself. I always feel judged in other restaurants, but that fear doesn’t exist here. It’s where even those who aren’t accepted at home can feel accepted.”Sahara Khadka Chhetri, owner of Pink Tiffany, Kathmandu’s first openly LGBTIQIA+ friendly restaurant and bar, frequently visits after managing the bar, appreciating the convenience of not cooking at home.She notes very few places like this cater to our community, and some even had to close during COVID. “As an entrepreneur, I know that sustaining these spaces is a challenge. But as more spaces like these open, they will make the way for a more inclusive and compassionate society.”The welcoming atmosphere at Inclusive Galaxy has also had a surprising effect on non-queer patrons. Samriddha Jung Rana, a twenty-year-old neighbour who identifies as straight, often visits the café and appreciates the importance of such spaces.“Previously, I didn’t know much about the queer community and didn’t care much. But now, coming into this café, I’ve been interested in their rights and issues. I’ve realised that we’re not so different after all. We are all human,” he remarks.The ventures like Inclusive Galaxy and Pink Tiffany have inspired hope for collaborative businesses between queer and non-queer groups. The recent initiative by the Nepal Tourism Board promoting Pink Tourism in April 2024 is a positive step. Still, Adhikari believes that more support is needed from the government and the private sector.Despite the progress, challenges remain. However, Adhikari remains optimistic about the future. He is working on plans to develop the restaurant into a homestay program in the future.“Like how different planets, asteroids, and stars make up a beautiful galaxy, people from all walks of life and identities make a beautiful society. I am happy that we are assimilating together in this space. We are not so different; we are all different and similar simultaneously,” he says. \nOne morning on a fading Tuesday of our vacation, I couldn't shake off the worry that my hard-earned savings from tutoring were slipping away faster than I’d planned. Out of nowhere, I messaged my friend Santona on a whim: ‘A trip to Rara’. With little hope, I awaited her reply, and I have no idea what I’d have done if she had denied it. However, just like the phrase “waiting for the nudge,” she enthusiastically agreed, and soon we roped in our friend, Nirjara.This wasn’t our first trip together—we’d ventured to Pokhara, tried bungee jumping, paragliding, and trekked trails like Khuma and Korchan since our first year of bachelor studies. My idea this time was a well-packaged tour, but plans changed, and new destinations were chosen. The pristine Tilicho Lake became our goal. Without overthinking, I agreed; after all, it’s Nepal and here, no matter where you decide to trek, you’ll experience heaven.From Kathmandu to Manang: Green Lake and apple delightsTravelling to Manang was a meditative experience in itself. As a scout exploring different parts of Nepal, I had often embraced the rush of adventure. But here, by the serene Green Lake under the sun's warm glow, I felt a genuine sense of accomplishment: ‘We’ve finally made it—without getting lost and in the right place.’ We clicked photos, laughed, and even made some silly TikTok videos. The famous apple farms of Manang called out to us with their irresistible offer: a feast of apples for just Rs200. If you’re travelling here, catching the early bus ensures Manang’s charm unfolds entirely by the end of the day.Khangsar to Tilicho Base Camp: rocks and rantsAn early morning jeep ride brought us to Khangsar. The trek was said to take 5-6 hours, but once we started, I moved ahead of my friends, a habit I don’t quite understand. I wondered if my friends would make it before dark. To my relief, their laughter and chatter soon filled the air, joining me.Then we set off into the landslide area, with jagged rocks above hanging like wind chimes ready to fall. We promised not to look up and remained focused on the trail. The journey was filled with everyday conversations from patriarchy to childhood TV shows, and before we knew it, the night wrapped around us as we arrived at the base camp. After some confusion over our booking, we finally settled in, ate quickly, and fell asleep. One tip: keep an eye on your things at Shrikharka—I lost my trekking poles there.Tilicho Lake: A view, a void, and acceptance Morning arrived. We emptied our room and set out, uncertain if we’d return in time and head straight to Shrikharka or stay the night again at base camp. One friend battled altitude sickness but pushed on fiercely, even bargaining for a horse ride, only to find me eventually outpacing it.As I neared the lake, the solitude and distance overwhelmed me. I called my father, who offered only a few comforting words before the line dropped. Thankfully, friends from home Nuya and Shri reached out, and I poured my thoughts to them through tears. With renewed spirit, I moved forward and finally reached a quiet pond that tricked me into thinking I’d arrived. Only after some guidance did I stand before the actual Tilicho Lake.Strangely, I felt no rush of joy. The sight was majestic, yet my reaction fell flat. I asked myself if it was okay to feel so indifferent. However, I accepted that sometimes it’s okay to feel nothing at all. A simple “I don’t know” was all the answers I needed.We had no rooms left on our last night at base camp, so we slept in a dorm, which was a cheaper and warmer option. After dinner, my friends drifted off, but I lingered by the fire, unwilling to leave its comfort. The dining hall was full of trekkers glued to their seats even after finishing their food until a friendly trek guide offered us seats. These guides, cheerful and chatty, shared fun stories and gossip.Ultimately, I want to say to all who recently went trekking, whether funded by parents or your hard-earned savings, to be proud and grateful for the opportunity to explore. And for those who couldn’t go this time, trust that your moment will come. Keep moving forward with hope, knowing that one day, your adventure awaits. \nThe noise of ever-growing traffic, the breaking and mending of black-topped roads, and an ever-expanding concrete jungle are some features that one would associate with the Kathmandu Valley.It is a wildly growing urban forest quickly transforming into a busy metropolis where every inch of space is ready to be sold and built. Yet, pockets of the past remain—small, peaceful neighbourhoods where houses are still made of wood, paths are made of stone tiles, and the stillness of a world that wants to stay intact and immobile. These places are known for tourism, culture, and the restoration of community pride. One such stop is the quiet village of Khokana in southern Lalitpur.Khokana is comparatively close to the mainland urban Lalitpur; from the ring road junction of Bagdole, it takes only a 10-minute drive to reach there. From the airport, you can take a cab directly to Khokana, which will take around half an hour. Get your cameras and hiking boots ready; the area is filled with historical artefacts and hiking trails.However, it is vastly different from the city. It is much nearer to the hills, where stone-paved paths, which could easily be goat trails, are rare in today’s Kathmandu.One such goat trail leads to Sikali temple, a major attraction of the area and accessible only on foot. The pavements are lined with big and small temples on each side, along with ponds that serve as clean water sources and a location for religious rituals. The houses are made of bricks and wood. The concrete invasion, although present, is minimal. Scattered every few hundred metres are small mustard oil mills, co-operative businesses of the locals of Khokana that have existed since medieval times.A site well-recognised for its historical significance, Khokana was even proposed to be made a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1996. Sikali TempleAround an hour’s walk from the historic town, Sikali Temple can be reached, which is also the location for its famed Sikali Jatra.While it can be reached through any public vehicle, a more holistic and adventurous route is to follow the goat trails on the outskirts of Khokana. This route, albeit long, allows for great hiking opportunities, scenic views of the hills surrounding the Kathmandu Valley, and a close-up view of the mediaeval but well-maintained architecture of the local houses.Even if you lose the way, which is very possible, the locals are very welcoming and more than willing to guide you. The main temple itself is three stories tall, and built in the Pagoda style, a common style in many temples in the valley.It is surrounded by a lush grass field which plays the stage to the Sikali Jatra held every year. The temple, like many religious spots around Khokana, is dedicated to the local deity Shree Rudrayani.The Sikali Jatra, a five-day festival that serves as an alternative to Dashain for the Khokana locals, is filled with chariot dances, battle enactments, and storytelling celebrations in the worship of Goddess Rudrayani.Starting from Ghatasthapana in mid to late September, the Jatra is vibrant and an essential experience for every visitor. Historical Khokana townKhokana’s historical town is located around 5 minutes walking distance from the local bus park. The town complex, paved with hand-made stone tiles, is graced with the Indrayanee temple but also has many red-bricked houses built in the local Newari architecture, some of them centuries old.One such house is the ‘Khokana Museum’. Although closed, it is widely popular for being the first house to be lit with electricity in Nepal, as Chandra Shamsher did in 1911.The stand-holder of the first light bulb can still be seen, serving as a historical monument for everyone to see.Similarly, the town complex is also filled with Guthi houses, small ponds, and even the local Ward office. While the Ward office provides a wealth of information for visitors interested in the area’s history, the Guthi halls symbolise the strong community support culture of the locals.The ponds, a notable one present right opposite the Indrayanee temple, have stone taps and remind us of primitive ways of obtaining clean water—a practice many locals are still engaged in.Yet, these ponds are also religious locations, especially used in rituals in the Sikali Jatra.Finally, a stroll through the complex allows visitors to explore old houses and historical artefacts in the serene quietness of Khokana, while the small outlets and Choila places nearby allow you to enjoy the spicy duck or chicken delicacies at the same time.Overall, the historical complex is enough to transport visitors back to a glimpse of the medieval past of the Kathmandu Valley. Mustard oil millsThe most well-known feature of Khokana is its mustard oil mills, which have been operational for hundreds of years and have been using the same methods of preparation since their inception.These mills, scattered throughout Khokana, are often community-owned, and even the ones owned by certain individuals have almost exclusively employed locals.Despite the advent of modern machinery, there is still substantial demand for their products due to the assured guarantee.When I visited one such mill, the local staff informed me that the furnace and oil presser used by them were 300 years old, given by the Patan royalty even before the Shahs became king.In addition to buying pure, organically created mustard oil and pellets, visiting these oil mills offers many educational benefits for international and local tourists alike.Khokana offers visitors a unique glimpse into a preserved bubble of the past through its tranquillity, preservation of ancient lifestyle and cultural elements, and remarkable self-sustenance.  \n“How much oxygen do you have for the summit?”I think this is the kind of question a film producer would ask. But when you're on the mountain, the answer is never clear.I have worked for a long time in the film industry and different art areas, especially photography and engraving.Working in various fields and drawing inspiration from them has become a new normal for me. I have made this approach my way of life without even realising it.I took responsibility for producing the last movie I worked on and shot the behind-the-scenes footage for a documentary. By doing so, I witnessed the entire shooting process and the journey of a movie.In the snowy highlands of Turkey, we had to endure the consequences of the changing climate to shoot ‘About Dry Grasses’, directed by Nuri Bilge Ceylan. The highlands used to be snowy in January, but by the time we got there in the same month, there was no snow. Nature was changing. It was responding to what was happening—to what humanity had done to it. In the end, it snowed, and we shot the intense snow scenes we wanted. But since most of our days were sunny, unlike what the director wanted, we had to shoot in the sunset and sunrise hours. As crew members, we spent many days waiting for the sun to set.Production requires creating opportunities, finding solutions, and being creative for a work of art to come true. For this, patience, endurance, calmness, and timing are necessary. On the other hand, nature wanted us to listen to it and wait for the right time.During that time, I witnessed many of nature's lessons. For example, I experienced extreme cold for the first time. We endured temperatures ranging from -33 degrees to +55 degrees. By listening to nature, surrendering to its forces, and working within its limits, we managed to persevere.No matter how much you prepare or plan during the pre-production phase, if you are working in nature, remember that nature will always have the final say.The film was completed, released, and connected with audiences. Its success at Cannes 2023 was followed by my trip to the North Pole for my project. I returned with a mix of wonderful developments, joys, and challenges. During this process, I experienced life and death, happiness and sadness, losses and awards.I realised the value of being able to breathe comfortably a few days after my father's chemotherapy ended. Just a few days earlier, he had said, \"Well done, my daughter. I'm glad you went!\" All the anxiety and hard work, filled with fears at the beginning, were finally behind me.Before going to Everest, when I was on the verge of giving up, defeated by my fears, I remembered my father's words. Everest reminded me of what he said while struggling to breathe, adding a turning point to my life.What does it mean to say ‘life’s turning point?’ How many turning points can there be in life?Who am I, and what am I doing in this world? How well do I know my own limits? Can I find answers to these big questions? These thoughts sparked my dream of journeying to Everest. Now, after returning, I can say that it turned my life around.“How much oxygen do you need for the summit?” sounds more like “How much do you need to hold on to life?” How many reasons do you find that give meaning to your life, keep you alive, and allow you to breathe? How much can you endure in the face of obstacles, and can you keep believing that a solution will eventually come your way?Can these questions be separated from the idea of measuring and assessing something, from learning its quantity and financial value? Can everything be known with certainty? Should the journey be fully understood in advance, with all its promises laid out? Should it be viewed like a purchase with a price tag, asking, “Is this journey worth this much?”I had never trekked before and had no climbing experience. I had lived at sea level my entire life and had never been to a high altitude.However, this journey was not only about the physical climb but also an inner discovery. After losing my father to lung cancer, his breathing difficulties taught me the fragility of breath, life, and existence. I also mentally prepared myself for the physical challenges I might face. Despite all my concerns, could this journey help me understand the cycle of life and the resilience of the soul?So, how could I make this trek possible? How could I land in Nepal? Despite all the economic difficulties and the many things I felt needed organising, I did my best and believed in it.Since I was embarking on this journey, I felt I should share about my travels and inspire others.Starting with photography, cinema, and engraving, which are already integral parts of my life, I dreamed of documenting and sharing the inspiring aspects of this journey.After months of correspondence and dreaming, it all came true. Finally, I embarked on the journey with the goal of creating photographs, engravings, and documentaries. I learned a great deal from my travels in Nepal, from the people I met, and from every moments I witnessed. I felt incredibly fortunate to have been able to honour my father’s memory with the peace and serenity I experienced in the Himalayas.During my 15-day journey to Everest Base Camp, I encountered nature’s masterpieces at every turn. As concerns like “How will I endure?” and “How will I finish?” started to weigh on me, the mountains suddenly parted with the clouds and gazed down at me.It was amazing to witness the appearance of ‘Gods’ that I had never seen before, in such immense size and in such a close, awe-inspiring manner beside me during that silent walk.As someone who came from one of the most crowded cities in the world, Istanbul, while I struggled with my daily questions and uncertainties, trying to control everything, they stood there calmly, as if answering me.They were just there—before and after.My guide, Lakhpa Sherpa, always reminded me not to worry about how high we were, how long it would take to reach our accommodation, or what the weather would be like. He encouraged me to live in the moment, and he was right.He advised me to focus on my breathing, not to get thirsty, to eat enough, and to appreciate the extraordinary beauty of the journey. In the mountains, plans dissolve and each moment is embraced as it comes.All the good wishes, prayers, and everything encountered along the way were for the journey itself. The mountain was full of life, secrets, and everything I had wondered about.This 15-day journey to Everest Base Camp was a solo adventure, yet I wouldn't have been able to complete it without my guide, Lhakpa, and my porter. Additionally, I was fortunate enough to experience the hospitality, generosity, and honesty at Trekkers Paradise, which organised the entire journey and provided guidance.I witnessed how dedication and sincerity are crucial in completing a journey safely and healthily. Ghanshyam Sharma, from Trekkers Paradise and Sauraj Jhingan, a climber who summited the Everest in 2018, shared their experiences with me during the journey.They experienced the 2015 earthquake while they were at the Everest Base Camp.As a filmmaker, their role as actors, and attention to detail played a significant role in bringing my dream photography and documentary project to life.The sponsors of my journey were Turkish Airlines, The North Face, Apple, Canon, and Stanley. My supporters include Oscar International College and Nepal Film Campus. Throughout the journey, I shared many experiences, memories, and countless photos and images with my students.On my way back home after 21 days, I celebrated my birthday on the plane. From the right window, the Himalayas bid me farewell. I felt like I had opened a new chapter in my life, and I was certain that I would return.I had made many friends and memories in Nepal.For now, I will be working on a documentary and preparing for a photography and engraving exhibition titled ‘My Soul Beyond the Mountain’.To the Himalayas: This summer was spent with you, but we will meet again soon. \nWe spent five days in Sri Lanka two weeks ago, driving up and down the island, covering almost 70 percent of its territory. Our tour spanned over 1,000 kilometres, including hills, beach spots, and heritage and religious sites.Our first stop in Sri Lanka was Colombo’s Bandaranaike International Airport. We were greeted by a warm and humid breeze when we exited the airport. The host briefed us (a group of journalists) that heavy rainfall has affected areas across Sri Lanka since mid-May 2024. Rain and storms intensified on June 1, with the most significant effects in the south and west of the country. We were lucky to have no rain in the forecast.On the first night, we checked into the lavish Jetwing Lake resort, an opulent sanctuary amidst the lush landscape. The resort’s expansive grounds were a retreat, offering a glimpse of Sri Lanka's natural beauty. We feasted on delicious cuisine, every bite exploding with flavour, introducing us to the island’s famed culinary delights. On June 7, early morning, the sun shone brightly, previewing the promise of an incredible journey ahead. We set off early the following day, eager to explore the mysteries of this enchanting island. As we ventured further into the heart of Sri Lanka, the landscape revealed its majestic nature. We were astounded by seeing Pidurangala Rock, a 200-metre-high granite colossus just a kilometre north of Sigiriya. The short hike to Pidurangala Rock offered breathtaking views of Sigiriya and beyond. We climbed the steep steps and soon were rewarded with a breathtaking panoramic view of the surrounding landscape. It took us 30 minutes to climb. The sight took our breaths away and left us humbled in the presence of such grandeur. From the top are glorious vistas of the surrounding landscape and an incredible view of the majestic Sigiriya Rock. From there, Sigiriya Lion’s Rock is visible, standing alone. This was the place where demon king Ravana had his palace in the Treta Yuga. Believed to have been built 50 centuries ago, the palace is said to have had a unique lift for Ravana and his visitors. Ravana imprisoned Sita in one of the caves at the bottom of this humongous boulder. Sigiriya is a fifth-century fortress in Sri Lanka carved out of an inselberg, a hill of hard volcanic rock that soared high above the surrounding jungle. We spent two hours atop the rock, mainly taking photographs. We descended from Pidurangala Rock, filled with awe and a sense of accomplishment.The journey ahead seemed even more enticing as we ventured along the winding roads, heading towards our next destination.Cash-strapped Sri Lanka plunged into its worst financial crisis in more than seven decades in 2022, with a severe dollar shortage sending inflation soaring to a high of 70 percent, its currency to record lows, and its economy contracting 7.3 percent.Thanks to the growing number of tourists, Sri Lanka is now bouncing back.In Jetwing Lake, we met Kasun Pradeep Somasiri, a receptionist. He briefed us that the resort is now 50 percent occupied. “That’s a better figure now as we are recovering.”The travel and tourism sector is a significant income generator for Sri Lanka. However, the economic crisis, the Ukraine–Russia war, and China’s zero-Covid policy have jeopardised the industry.Tourism accounted for more than 12 percent of the country’s GDP in 2019 and was the third-largest source of foreign exchange reserves, behind worker remittances and the apparel industry.Sri Lanka was poised to be one of the world’s best holiday destinations due to its rich culture, wealth of natural resources, and diversity of accessible experiences.However, tourism-dependent Sri Lanka suffered its first major setback with the Easter bombings 2019. This led to the collapse of inbound tourism flows as international arrivals declined by 18 percent year-on-year, and tourist expenditure fell by 17.7 percent that year. This was immediately followed by two years of pandemic restrictions. Inbound visitors fell to just 116,600 in 2021.An acute balance of payments crisis forced Sri Lanka to preemptively default on foreign debt of over $50 billion in April 2022, triggering a crippling economic contraction with spiralling inflation.“Tourism is gaining momentum,” says Somasiri. “The British and Chinese have started to return to Sri Lanka.”January-August is the peak season for foreigners. “From December to April, local people travel for holiday purposes,” says Somasiri. Before we started the tour to other religious sites, our tour guide, Sampath Mayadunne, told us, “Don't take selfies with your back to Buddha.” Turning your back on a Buddha statue and some other religious sites to take photos and videos is a strict no-no.The most common sight across Sri Lanka is the tank cascades system, an ancient irrigation infrastructure. The system is a network of small tanks draining to large reservoirs that store rainwater and surface runoff for later use.“These infrastructures were built by its ancient kings over 2,000 years ago to solve the water scarcity in the country’s dry zone,” says Mayadunne.On day two, we travelled to Ranweli Spice Garden in Matale. This garden is famous for its rare spices and herbs. A tour of the gardens will show you the cultivation, harvesting, cleaning, and packaging process, as well as the health benefits and uses of the herbs.On the way, we saw a colourful Muthumariamman Hindu temple, boasting hundreds of detailed sculptures in a rich mosaic of colour.In Kandy, we visited the Temple of the Tooth Relic (Sri Dalada Maligawa), one of the most sacred places of worship in the Buddhist world. It was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1988.The temple sustained damage from bombings by Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna in 1989 and by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam in 1998. However, it was fully restored each time.We then headed to Jetwing St Andrew’s, a luxurious 5-star property in Sri Lanka’s hill country of Nuwara Eliya, situated at 1,900 metres above sea level. During our stay in Kandy, we immersed ourselves in the city's charm and the serenity of the countryside. On the third day, early morning, we travelled to Nuwara Eliya, the area famous for tea estates that give many Nepalis the feeling that they have come to Kanyam, Ilam, in eastern Nepal.We visited a tea factory called Damro Labookellie Tea Centre, the oldest tea centre in Sri Lanka. Due to its cold climate, it is the most important area for tea production in Sri Lanka.In this tea factory, they make white and black tea, while the green tea is processed in another tea factory and then sent to Damro.After the tea factory tour and the tea tasting, we headed to Galle, our next resting point.We encountered narrow, winding, and maze-like streets and alleys in Nuwara Eliya, known as ‘Little England’. The town has preserved almost all its British-era buildings and is calm and beautiful. On our way to Galle, at the roadside, our tour guide stopped us at the famed Sita temple, which has Hanuman's footprints and is the place where Sita, wife of Lord Rama, was held captive by the demon king Ravana after he abducted her from India.We were at Sita Eliya, a temple named Sri Seethai Amman.When we reached the Hindu temple, rich in vibrant colours and architectural elements, it was full of devotees. The water stream adjoining the temple is believed to be where Sita bathed. Large footprints are found on the stones in the stream, and there is a saying that those belong to Hanuman, who came spying to find Sita’s whereabouts.In Ella, Ravana’s waterfalls are significant in the Rama-Ravana story. The cascade charms visitors from all over the globe. The waterfall is easily accessible and is known to have hidden caves at the top, which are believed to have been used as Ravana's residence.The 25-metre-tall waterfall is a beautiful cascade that provides the perfect backdrop for a photo to remember your Ramayana trail adventures in Sri Lanka. A short pilgrimage tour ended there, and it was now time for an adventure. Though it was not part of our itinerary, our guide decided to tour us on a train ride.Though short, only six kilometres from Ella to Demodera, it was thrilling. Everyone screamed in unison like kids on a fair ride to hear the echoes in the dark every time we passed through the tunnels. The sound of the train is subtly different inside a tunnel. For the first-timer, the darkness and shouts inside the tunnels when the train passes would be scary, like a horror movie.The train we boarded wasn’t crowded, but people had already filled the doorway, ready for the scenic journey.With the shrill sound of a whistle, the train slowly pulled away from the platform at Ella, passing houses, coconut trees and green fields.As the train progressed, tourists and locals were leaning out the windows and crowding to hang out the doors. I joined the crowd and hung out on a train. A short excitement ended there.After lunch, we headed to Galle and reached Jetwing Lighthouse. As soon as our group entered the hotel, they shouted with excitement.The hotel is on a rocky outcrop three miles west of Galle. Waves crash over giant boulders in front of it and produce howling winds.We were at Galle’s 17th-century fort five minutes from the hotel on day four. In the Bay of Galle on the southwest coast of Sri Lanka, Galle Fort was built first in 1588 by the Portuguese and lavishly rebuilt by the Dutch during the 17th century. It is a historical, archaeological and architectural heritage monument that maintains a perfect appearance even after more than 436 years.We then reached Hikkaduwa Beach, a popular beach destination on the southern coast of Sri Lanka. On the way, we saw a 30-metre-high Big Buddha Statue. It is a replica of the 6th-century Buddhas of Bamiyan destroyed by the Taliban in Afghanistan. It was created using the earliest known sketches of the statue. It was built in remembrance of the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami victims.We then travelled through the 222-kilometre-long Southern Expressway, Sri Lanka's first expressway linking the capital, Colombo, with Galle, Matara, and Hambantota, significant cities south of the island.On day five, we reached Colombo, the capital of Sri Lanka. Jetwing Colombo Seven hosted us in the bustling capital. We took a city tour early morning and visited Bally's Casino at night.On day six, we returned to Kathmandu early in the morning on a Sri Lankan Airlines flight, the airline that organised the trip in coordination with Jetwing Hotels Limited, a Sri Lankan hotel chain.National flag carrier Nepal Airlines, in its previous avatar as Royal Nepal Airlines, used to operate direct flights to Colombo during the 1980s. However, the carrier suspended operations following an armed movement by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) in Sri Lanka. There had been no direct air links between the two countries for decades.In 2016, Himalaya Airlines started a chartered flight that lasted a few months due to low traffic movement between the two countries. Sri Lankan Airlines started operating direct flights to Kathmandu in August 2021.“The main objective of this media tour is to increase tourism in both countries for mutual benefit. We want to draw Nepalis for pilgrims and leisure activities,” says Nilina Pathirana, Country Manager at Srilankan Airlines in Nepal.“We have understood that Nepali travellers tend to travel to Bangkok, Vietnam, Malaysia, Dubai, and Maldives. Nepalis have quite minimal knowledge about Sri Lanka and the religious connection between Lanka and Nepal. We want to promote Nepal and Sri Lanka jointly. This will be a win-win business,” added Pathirana.The airline said it currently carries 60 percent of the passengers from Nepal to Sri Lanka and beyond destinations like Tokyo, Sydney, Melbourne, and other Middle Eastern destinations. The return airfare for a 3.5-hour-long flight starts at Rs74,000. “We have a four-night, five-day package that begins from Rs80,000, depending on the properties and extended itineraries,” says Pathirana.Nepalis must submit certain required documents for visa processing, like their passport copy and bank statement. Due to this government-to-government policy, only Nepalis must obtain a prior visa. Otherwise, Sri Lankans are required to have a visa upon arrival.“The other best thing is that Sri Lankan Airlines can be involved with the visa process or facilitate the Nepalis tourists. Our main intention is to have a sustainable market in Kathmandu and make it a daily flight,” says Pathirana. \nMundhum Trek in Koshi province in the eastern part of Nepal is a new cultural walking trail. It passes through several indigenous ethnic villages and landscapes in Khotang and Bhojpur districts. This trail goes up to an elevation of 4,200 metres to the viewpoint of Silchung Peak and takes one through the settlements of the Kirati people. This route starts from Diktel Bazaar and passes through beautiful settlements like Chakhewa, Rawa Dhap, Salpa Bhanjyang, Silchung and Hanspokhari before ending in Bhojpur. There are some hotels in Diktel but trekkers are advised to carry tents. The trail offers panoramic views of most of the eight-thousanders, including Everest, Lhotse, Makalu, Cho Oyu and Kanchenjunga mountains. The spring season, March through May, is highly recommended for the trek.Janaki Mandir Janaki Mandir at Janakpur in Madhesh province was constructed in 1874 and is a blend of Mughal and local architecture. The temple is a three-storey building and has 60 rooms, making it the largest temple in Nepal. Pilgrims flock here by the thousands to pay homage to Janaki Mandir—Janaki being the other name of Sita, the daughter of King Janak. The temple houses an idol of Sita which was found near Ayodhya, the kingdom of Ram. The marriage anniversary of Lord Ram and Sita is celebrated in Janakpur every year on Vivaha Panchami, which falls in December. In the southwest corner of Janaki Mandir is the Vivaha Mandap, which has been built at the site where the marriage of Ram and Sita is said to have taken place. Another well-known temple in the vicinity is Ram Mandir, which is built in pagoda style and is hence different from the other temples in Janakpur that generally bear resemblance to Mughal architecture. It houses a female statue, said to be of Yogamaya, which has the reputation of being one of the most beautiful images of female forms in Nepal. Other holy sites of interest include the Laxman Temple, Sankat Mochan Temple and Hanuman Temple.Kuri Village, Kalinchok Kuri village, a popular tourist destination around 150 km from Kathmandu, lies at an altitude of 3,842 metres above sea level in Kalinchowk of Dolakha district, in Bagmati province. People visit the place to enjoy the snow during the winter besides the mesmerising landscapes and splendid panoramic view of the Himalayan range. Kalinchok gets snow mainly at the end of December and the snowfall continues till the end of February or mid-March. When there is snow, it is difficult for jeeps, buses and cars to reach the top of Kuri village. Chains are wrapped around the wheels of vehicles and specially modified jeeps with highly experienced drivers are used to carry visitors. There are several hotels and restaurants in the area. The road up to Kuri has also improved over the years.Annapurna Base Camp Annapurna Base Camp trek, in Gandaki province, makes for a picturesque journey that takes you to the foothills of the Annapurna South, up to 4,130 metres above sea level. The five-day trek (seven days for slow walkers) offers rich cultural diversities, typical Nepali villages and the flora and fauna nestled at the foothills of Annapurna. The distance from Pokhara to Annapurna Base Camp is approximately 81 kilometres. It is among the shortest and most budget-friendly treks in Nepal. For Nepalis, lodging costs around $5 to $10 per day. For foreigners, the overall cost of the trek ranges from $800 to $1500 on average per person. Annapurna Base Camp trek can be done at any time throughout the year as each season offers a different trekking experience. The ideal time for the trek depends on your weather preferences and what you expect from it. However, autumn (September to October) and spring (March to May) are considered the two best seasons for the trek, as the days at the time are warm and bright with clear skies.Bardiya National Park Bardiya National Park, located in the southern Tarai belt of Lumbini province, is home to one of the most elusive and majestic animals on earth—the Royal Bengal Tiger. The park, which covers an area of 968 square kilometres, is considered one of the most important protected areas in the country. It is a prime destination for those looking to catch a glimpse of a tiger. A bit of luck and patience will offer a good chance to see the Bengal Tiger. The jungle safari also offers one the opportunity to spot Asian elephants and the greater one-horned rhinoceros. The rare Gangetic river dolphins are occasionally spotted on rafting trips along the Geruwa River, the eastern channel of the Karnali river. Besides, visitors can enjoy the homestays and explore local Tharu culture. The right time to visit the park is from mid-September to mid-December and mid-February to May.Khaptad National Park Khaptad National Park in Sudurpaschim province is a protected area in the far western region. It stretches over four districts of Bajhang, Bajura, Achham and Doti and ranges in elevation from 1,400 to 3,300 metres. The park can be visited throughout the year. Trekkers are advised to bring their tents, food and other supplies. The Nepal Tourism Board says of late, social media has been increasingly influencing Nepali travellers to go to Khaptad. Since the far-flung Khaptad National Park is still offbeat for many travellers, the area remains pristine and fresh. The seasons of spring (March-May) and autumn (October-November) are the ideal times to visit the park. The temperature ranges from 10°c to 20°c offering pleasant trekking weather. The monsoon begins in June and lasts until September and during this time, roads often become muddy and slippery. From December to February, winter brings snow and chilling winds to the park.Limi Valley \nNepal have been eliminated from the Women’s ACC U-19 Cup after suffering a nine-wicket defeat to Bangladesh in the Super-4 stage on Friday. The loss dashed Nepal's hopes of reaching the final.Bangladesh comfortably chased Nepal’s modest target of 55 runs in the slated 11 overs, achieving it in just 9.5 overs while losing only one wicket. Fahomida Choya led Bangladesh’s charge with an unbeaten 26 runs, supported by Mosammat Eva (18 runs) and Sumaiya Akhter Suborna (10 runs). Kusum Godar was the sole wicket-taker for Nepal.The match, played at the Bayuemas Oval in Malaysia, was reduced to 11 overs per side due to rain. Nepal, batting first after losing the toss, managed to score only 54 runs for the loss of eight wickets in their allotted overs.Nepal’s opener, Sabitri Dhami, was the top scorer with 11 runs, while captain Puja Mahato and Elisha Yadav contributed nine and eight runs, respectively.With this victory, Bangladesh secured a spot in the final, finishing the Super-4 stage with six points. India, with seven points, advanced to the final.Nepal had earlier made headlines in the group stage with a historic win against Pakistan, securing their place in the Super-4. However, their journey ended with the defeat to Bangladesh, highlighting the challenges of competing at the top level. \nChaaaiiittt…The spontaneous eruption of the sound of victory thundered through the neighbourhood of Nhyokha in the Kathmandu core. The line of a kite cut another. Looking out the window of her house, Sajani Shrestha saw children running full speed, shouting and fighting as they vied to catch the falling kite and thread. And craning her neck up to the sky, she could not count but only be mesmerised by the innumerable kites strewn across the skies of Nhyokha, Bangemudha, Indrachowk. “There would be so many kites that they entirely covered the blue of the sky, making beautiful patterns of different colours,” says the 51-year-old. “And you cannot imagine the number of times the call of chait rang in the air.”Clear blue sky and gentle westerlies, the season of kites has arrived in the Kathmandu Valley. While kites soared Kathmandu's sky mainly during Dashain, the kite season officially started in Nag Panchami (August) and ended on the Haribodhini Ekadashi (November). And from royalities to commoners, young and old all flew kites from rooftops and open grounds. Even those who did not, like Sajani, revelled in the live spectacle in the sky as kites soared and fought. With Bhimsen Thapa’s help, King Girvanyuddha flies kites The earliest written account of kite flying is believed to date to 200 BC in China. In Kathmandu, this tradition has religious and socio-cultural and environmental significance, says Tina Manandhar, lecturer of Nepalese History, Culture and Archaeology at Tribhuvan University. According to her, it is believed that kites in Kathmandu skies carry a message to the god of rain Indra that the valley's farmers have had enough rain for their crops. That is why Kathmandu farmers scolded anyone flying kites before plantation season.In an article ‘Changako Utpati Ra Bikas’ published in Gorkhapatra in 1995, historian Rajesh Gautam points to the lack of written documents indicating the exact time when kite culture was introduced in Nepal. Exploring different opinions on kite's introduction to Nepal, he writes that “some have opined the possibility that the skill and tradition of kite flying might have entered Nepal through India.” Yet some others, he writes, state that kites “came to Nepal from Japan during the time of [Rana PM] Dev Shumsher.”He concludes that most likely this tradition was introduced by Malla-era Newar traders: “But since Nepal’s relationship with Tibet and China is very old and direct, kites might have entered Nepal through the Newar traders who were engaged in the trade. One can estimate that the kite was introduced to Nepal during the (mediaeval) Malla regime.”In Social History of Nepal, TR Vaidya, Tri Ratna Manandhar and Shankar Lal Joshi write that there exists documented evidence of the kite flying from the early 19th century. The authors state that Sundarananda, a contemporary poet, has mentioned that the young king Girvanyuddha Bikram Shah (r.1799-1816), with the help of Prime Minister Bhimsen Thapa, flew kites from the towering temple of Taleju Bhawani, Hanumandhoka. And when the king's kite cut the kites of the youngsters, they were located and rewarded with money.In Tyas Bakhatko Nepal, Sardar Bhim Bahadur Pandey states that “During the month of Kartik [October-November] young and old all flew kites,” suggesting that kite culture was ubiquitous in Kathmandu by the early twentieth century.Anticipations and preparationsKite flying in Nepal requires a kite, a lattai (a wooden spool), thread and majha (homemade adhesive prepared by boiling snail slime, rice or sago, and powdered glass from burnt electric bulbs and coated on the line to sharpen it for kite fighting).77-year-old Nirmal Man Tuladhar, an avid kite flyer and retired professor of Linguistics at the Tribhuvan University, explains how Nepali tradition of kite flying was both expensive and needing advance preparation.“In our times, it wasn’t easy to fly kites,” he says. “We had to prepare majha …And as Nepali kites are fighter kites, we mainly fought with other kites [which meant we spent a lot of threads].”This preparation needed first and foremost of passing a hurdle: securing finances and materials to fly kites. While lattai was a one-time investment that could be saved for years, kites and threads had to be replenished every time a kite was cut.“Those were the times when parents wanted us to be more focused in our studies. They only gave money [to buy kites] after immense pestering,” says 80-year-old Dwarika Nath Dhungel, former Secretary of Nepal government, speaking of the 1950s and 1960s.Biodiversity specialist and botanist Tirtha Bahadur Shrestha, 86, was born in Mahabouddha and began flying kites from 1951-52. He saved what little money he got for afternoon snacks to buy Hattimar reel, a brand of line wound in a small lattai, which was strong and sharp and where majha stuck well.Raghuji Pant, a member of parliament, also recalls the difficulty in securing money to sustain his kite flying in and around Kathmandu core in the 1960s and early 1970s. “Four to five of my kites were cut in a day,” writes the 67-year-old in his 2019 article “Changa Jastai Udi Hidne Man” published in Himalkhabar. “[This caused] the line in the spool to shorten. From Bhadra [August-September] to one to one and a half months after Dashain I spent flying kites. So, it was difficult for me to have enough kites even after getting money from grandfather, grandmother, mother and everyone.”Kites and thread secured, now began the crucial work of preparing and applying majha whose strength determined how well it cut other kites. Govinda Tandon, 70, a historian and heritage expert, who grew up in Battisputali, was also an ardent kite flyer.“Materials for making majha were prepared right from the morning on a holiday,\" he writes in his article “Dashainko Butte Changa” published in Gorkhapatra. “Because this work couldn’t be accomplished without a collaboration of 3-4 friends, a holiday was set aside for this. Moreover, a sunny day was considered appropriate. If the majha didn’t dry, the thread could turn moist, and so if it felt like the day wouldn’t be sunny, the entire plan…was aborted.”Kite makers, kite sellers and variety of kites One of the oldest shops in Kathmandu's memory, Shree Chitrakar Kite Center in Tyauda, Asan is bustling with customers during Dashain. “When my grandmother got married and came to this house at age 12 [in early 1940s], this shop was already here,” says its fourth generation owner 47-year-old Dinoj Chitrakar. “So the shop must be around a hundred years old.”Another shop that stands out in Kathmandu's memory is Manandhar Kite Center in Kalimati, established in 1949, and currently run by brothers Mohan Man and Sundar Man Manandhar.In his book Antar Taranga, artist and writer Manuj Babu Mishra recalls “a kite shop near the old halwai shop of Chabahil” in the 1940s. Dhungel and his 1960 batchmates of Juddhodaya Public School recall the kite shops from the 1950s and 1960s – Bekhacha’s Shop at Netapacho, Bhaicha’s Shop at Nhyokha, Lata Manandhar’s Shop at Maru, Kanchha Buddha Bajracharya Shop at Tyauda.Besides the shops, there were makers and sellers of kites cloistered in different localities of Kathmandu Valley.In Kwalkhu, Patan was a Joshi who made Nepali paper kites.“One day I accompanied my uncle to buy kites,\" writes Dibya Giri, 69, in his 2023 article “Changa” in Sahitya Post. “I was amazed to see the huge stacks of kites there. We used to call it the house of the kite maker.”In Nhyokha, Purna Bahadur Shrestha began making kites as a teenager and started his own kite business in the 1950s, according to his daughter Sajani.These kites, made out of Nepali paper, often had different paintings. Mishra recalls painting kites for the kite shop in Chabahil.“I went to that kite shop and with the freely available colours and Nepali papers, I spent my day painting faces, birds, animals, masks, mountains, hills, whatever came to my mind,” he writes in the book. “Such kites apparently sold well!”Most septuagenarians and older generations like Tuladhar and Tirtha Bahadur recall flying kites made of Nepali paper when young. Tirtha Bahadur says that kites from Lucknow began coming to Kathmandu only after the late 1950s. But at least a section of Kathmandu was flying kites from Lucknow from the early twentieth century. Vaidya, Manandhar and Joshi write that the Ranas and Shahs imported kites from Lucknow and that from them, their favourite employees also got to fly some. These kites were large and, in Tyas Bakhatko Nepal, Pande writes that they were referred to as Lucknowia kites.Known for their characteristic hissing sound they made while flying, light body, swift movement and ability to take sharp turns, Lucknow kites were preferred by kite fighters.“Lucknow kites were lighter and could be manoeuvred well,” says Tuladhar. “Kites of Nepali paper were stable but difficult to manoeuvre. They were also expensive. So only some fighters flew Nepali paper kites.”The kites had different names depending upon their designs and colours – Ambe (a heart in the centre), Dibdibe (chequered), Pakhete (a different coloured paper on one edge), Sete (white-coloured), Nilchi (blue-coloured), Rate (red-coloured) and so on.The kite fighters preferred the strong and sharp Hattimar reel that came on a small lattai. The Belchamar reel was cheaper but weaker and prone to be cut by other threads. Kite fliers and kite watchers on rooftops and open groundsBibek Shrestha, 57, and his two brothers took stacks of kites and climbed their rooftops. The rooftops around theirs in the neighbourhood of Nhyokha – in fact in all core settlements of the Valley – were filled with kite fliers and spectators. Many risked precariously balancing on the sloped roofs.While Bibek and his brothers’ kites alighted to meet the sea of kites in the sky, their sister Sajani and other family members gathered around to revel in the live spectacle.Dhungel remembers the rooftops of Jhochhen and surroundings of the 1950s and 1960s swelled with kite fliers. Dhungel did try to fly kites. But he did not become a successful kite flyer. What he did become was, like Sajani and many Kathmandu residents, an admirer of kites soaring in the sky.“But more than engaging in my unsuccessful kite flying attempts, I enjoyed looking at the kites flying. There would be a big crowd of spectators. Females and other family members watched the kites fly as they ate meat and chiura. Some even drank and rejoiced as they flew kites.”When the age of cassette player and speakers dawned in the 1980s, songs blared from the speakers alongside kite flying. Chitrakar and Bibek invited their friends, put their favourite songs on speakers and spent entire afternoons flying kites, dancing, singing and eating.Away from the core cities, in the villages in the Valley, people flew kites in open fields. Like Dibya, who set his kite for flight from the banks of Godavari River in Tikathali. Chhauni was also a popular space for flying kites.Kathmandu’s joy in kite fightingBibek pulled his kite down and then manoeuvred it back up so his line touched his opponent's line from below and quickly reeled out his line. The resulting sharpness from the speed cut the opponent's line.Chaaaiiitttt………“The greatest fun comes from cutting another kite's string,” writes Tuladhar in his 1996 article “Cutting is the greatest fun” published in magazine Kite Lines. “With its coating of adhesive paste and ground glass, the string is as sharp and abrasive as sandpaper on your opponent's line.”Nepali kite, Tuladhar says, is made to fight other kites, and describes how a kite line cuts the other.“The technique is to touch your rival's string and immediately reel out line at high speed,” he writes. “The Nepalese style of kite flying is aggressive, and though the kites look simple, they are strategically designed for bringing down other kites.”At any given time, like Bibek’s kite above Nhyokha sky, skies above the Valley were filled with raging kites, swinging, coming down and going up as the fighters reeled in and out their lattais in ferocious attempts to bring down other kites.Meanwhile spectators cheered. “Even passersby stopped to look at the kites,” recalls Tina.The moment of a kite cutting was accompanied by the sound of chait, and children ran in the direction of the falling kite to grab it and the thread in what was termed as, Dibya says, changa lutne/dhago lutne.Dhungel always joined in to shout the chait resounding through the locality of Jhochhen and almost automatically his feet sped towards the severed kites' direction.“‘Oii leave that thread,’ the kite owner would scold me. ‘Why do you pull my thread, leave it right now.’ But I’d continue pulling the threads as the owner continued shouting. Other times I caught the kites that had failed to fly and dropped on the ground.”The fallen kites got stuck in the buildings, trees or poles, or glided down in the open grounds or paddy fields. Falling kites from the Kathmandu core settled down in Tundikhel covering it. Oftentimes kites fell on the fields to rest upon the lush paddy nearing its harvest.“Children ran straight into the fields to catch the kite,” says Dibya. \"They destroyed the crops by stepping on them. Some farmers chased them, scolding along as they did so and if they caught anyone, they slapped them.”Love and restrictions on kiteAmidst the raging kite fights high up in the sky, there were apparently also some quieter kites lingering much lower among the buildings or tree lines, for their goals lay in not ruthlessly cutting the threads of other kites but piercing softly through the hearts of their owners' love interests. During the Rana regime, there were designated public spaces to fly kites, writes Gautam in his article. Referring to oral accounts, he writes that the Ranas were particularly careful to avoid kite flyers around their durbars. This is because love-stricken men tied letters to kites and flew them into the durbars to their love interests among the nanis.He writes that the kites could be flown mainly on the grounds of Chhauni. Anyone flying kites in any other place and around Rana durbars were arrested.Pant also recalls love-stricken boys from his time. “Just as kites came in different colours and patterns, so did kite flyers,” he writes in the article. “Some wrote love letters using a few words in “symbolic language” on a plain kite and attempted to land it on the rooftop of the girl they liked. Some simply landed their kites on any rooftop if a girl appeared there and waited for reaction.”King Tribhuvan among kite fliersPande writes in his book: “Once or twice during kite season every year, King Tribhuvan went to Chhauni to fly kites. Legend has it that if the line of the king’s kite was cut, it flew to Lhasa. But since anyone who caught that kite received five rupees, everyone attempted to catch that kite.”In 2021 news report ‘Bhawanle Chhekidiyo Changa Udaune Aakash’ by Shivahari Ghimire published in Nayapatrika, cultural expert the late Satyamohan Joshi also recounts that “During Dashain, Tribhuvan came to the ground below Swayambhu to fly kites. […] He did not use the same thread to fly kites twice.”In the same article, Joshi says that the King also went to Budhanilakantha to fly kites and participate in kite flying competitions.End of season, end of cultureMohan Krishna Shrestha, 86, was born in Budhanilakantha. Every year, on the day of Haribodhini Ekadashi, he saw the annual fair at the Budhanilakantha Temple. He also witnessed kite fliers gathered in the open fields around the Temple.“Oh, it’d be a lot of people,” says Shrestha. “They came from all around Bhaktapur, Kathmandu and Lalitpur.”They flew kites on Ekadashi, Dwadashi and some even until Purnima.“They took all the remaining threads and kites that had survived Dashain and flew the last kites of the season,” says Tuladhar. “I remember my uncles, relatives and neighbours going to Budhanilakantha with their kites.”Joshi recalls in the 2021 article that King Tribhuvan also went to Budhanilakantha with his sons Mahendra, Himalaya and Basundhara. He greatly supported and also participated in the competitions there organised by the commoners. If he liked he gave prize money to the winners.This annual event lost its glory days after the decline in the open fields as buildings began to rise with the establishment of Budhanilkantha School in 1972, Mohan says.“The event survived in some form until the 1990s,” he says.But what happened after that?The end-of-the-season event in the 1990s was also an indication of the end of the age-old kite tradition.“If I go to my ancestral place in Asan to fly kites, it’s not possible for me to do that today because there are buildings everywhere,” says Tuladhar. “Cityscapes and urbanisation have created the obstacle for flying kites.”Dibya does feel like flying kites sometimes.“No space to fly kites today,” he says. “In the old times, there were river banks and open fields. Even if you fly kites, it gets stuck in somebody's rooftop or water tank or somewhere.”Yesteryear’s kite enthusiasts believe that increasing means of entertainment was another reason for the decline of kite culture.“When television came, kite flying started to slowly decrease,” says Bibek. “And then mobile phones robbed kite flying even more.”And so, when his sister Sajani cranes her neck up in the sky today, she rarely sees a kite.“Those days we heard one chait after another,” she says. “These days you won’t hear a single chait.” \nIn 2008 Matina Shakya was only three years old when she was appointed as the Kumari of Kathmandu. She was succeeded by Trishna Shakya as the new Kumari in 2017.Kumaris are revered as goddesses of beauty and strength in certain Hindu and Buddhist traditions. Worshipping young girls as Kumaris is a 2,000-year-old practice in Nepal. Since the 13th century, when the Malla kings ruled, the Newars of the Kathmandu Valley have been worshipping Kumari, a girl from the Shakya/Bajracharya community chosen to embody the divine energy of goddess Taleju Bhawani. The reign of a Kumari ends when she starts menstruating. So long as she is serving as the Kumari, she is believed to be the nation’s divine protector, safeguarding it from evil. Matina, 18, is now in her first year of college, studying for a bachelor’s degree in management. Her father, Pratapman Shakya, when asked about having a daughter who is the only living the goddess in the world said, “Not having your own daughter live in the same house as you seemed a little unfair, but we feel very proud to call ourselves the parents of the royal Kumari who is revered by people all over the world.”On March 9, 2023, he, along with Matina, were getting ready for a special function held to honour all former Kumaris from across Nepal. “There are often events to honour Matina as she was the royal Kumari, but this one was dedicated to all former Kumaris from different areas. There are 129 living Kumaris in all,” he added. Besides Kathmandu, Kumari tradition is followed in Bhaktapur, Lalitpur, and Kirtipur, among other cities.According to him, this was the first time an event like this was organised and the Deputy Mayor of Kathmandu, Sunita Dangol, was also in attendance.Throughout the year, many people line up outside the ‘Kumari Ghar’ to get a chance to visit the Kumari and get her blessings. Many foreigners stand out in the yard to catch a glimpse of her. Nepali people believe that if a Kumari smiles at you, it is a bad omen.Everyday, a tutor visits the Kumari to help her continue with her education as she is not allowed to step outside the Kumari Ghar. She takes her exams and does her homework from the Kumari Ghar itself. She also has the freedom to play inside the Kumari Ghar. Many former kumaris have pursued careers in their fields of interest or studied after their term ends, and they continue to be treated with the same respect. The tradition of Kumari has evolved over time. In the past Kumaris did not enjoy these freedoms.Because of various superstitious beliefs, Kumaris were not fully educated and were forbidden from getting married because of the belief that the groom would die soon if he married an ex-Kumari. They led secluded lives, were restricted from participating in normal childhood activities, and focused solely on their religious duties.However, now, these myths have been dispelled. Modern understanding has shifted to recognise that Kumaris, after stepping down from their divine role, have the freedom to marry and lead a normal life. The perception of Kumaris as isolated figures has evolved, with a focus on providing them with a more balanced upbringing. There have been initiatives to integrate Kumaris into regular social and educational settings, allowing them to have a more holistic and fulfilling childhood experience. “Matina was already familiar with the students from the school that she attended after her term as Kumari ended,” said Shakya. “The kids visited the Kumari Ghar frequently so that she could have a smooth transition,” he added. According to Gautam Prasad Shakya, who has been living as a caretaker in the Kumari Ghar, the changes made to the tradition are minor. “The traditions of Kumari have mostly stayed the same. All the rituals are still practised like in the old days,” he said.On 6 May 2005, Pun Devi Maharjan, a lawyer, filed a case in the Supreme Court claiming that the traditional practice of electing young girls as Kumaris, or “goddesses’, who are expected to follow certain social restrictions and appear at religious festivals, violated the rights of the child. Quoting Maharjan’s complaint, Puskar Mathema writes in Yuwamanch Monthly of October 2007, “If Kumari tradition is continued, it will undermine the fundamental rights as well the freedoms of children guaranteed by the constitution and child rights treaties. Apart from this, it will have a negative impact on their physical and mental development.”The case continued while Nepal overthrew the monarchy and declared itself a secular state in 2007. When the judgement was pronounced in 2008, the goddess was still in her role, now giving blessings to the country’s President. The court ordered that the Kumaris and ex-Kumaris receive better benefits and arrangements and ordered the government to improve their support and allowances.In April 2006, Prof Chunda Bajracharya filed a petition at the Supreme Court against Maharjan’s petition, who had argued against the Kumari tradition. Bajracharya contended that the tradition should be preserved as heritage due to its over 100 years of history.“People who don’t understand the culture shouldn’t comment on it,” she stated. Bajracharya also criticised the human right activists who contended that Kumaris were only allowed to wear the colour red. “People who say Kumaris are forced to wear red clothing all the time, are the same people who send their kids to schools in uniform,” she said.“After the 2008 court verdict, there have been a lot of improvements. Now, a teacher visits the Kumari Ghar daily to tutor the Kumari, who is expected to complete school assignments and sit periodic exams. All the former Kumaris now get benefits like scholarships and special pensions,” she added.Bajracharya is currently a professor of literature at the Tribhuvan University in Kathmandu.“The only significant change that the court verdict brought to the tradition was in terms of her education,” said Gautam Prasad Shakya, the caretaker. “Kumaris were tutored long before the case, but the case helped formalise this arrangement. After the court verdict, the time between 12 pm and 4 pm was designated as the Kumari’s tuition time,” he added.After the verdict, there was a concerted effort to provide Kumaris with access to quality education, enabling them to develop the skills and knowledge needed to lead fulfilling lives beyond their divine roles. There was also a shift towards ensuring that the Kumari's living quarters are comfortable, safe, and conducive to her overall well-being.Moreover, the selection process for the Kumari underwent reforms in the aftermath of the Pun Devi Maharjan case. There was a push for greater transparency, accountability, and inclusivity in the selection of the Kumari, with an emphasis on ensuring that the process was fair, respectful, and free from undue influence.Efforts were made to support their transition into adulthood, including providing them with comprehensive resources for education, vocation, and social integration. This shift aimed to address the challenges faced by former Kumaris and empower them to lead independent and fulfilling lives after their divine service.“The Kumari tradition has evolved over time. During the tenure of my daughter, we saw a lot of improvements. Even after her time as Kumari, Matina continued to get a lot of government support,” said Shakya, former Kumari Matina’s father.“Some people argue that child rights are being violated, but all of her rights are being upheld inside the Kumari Ghar. This is a unique and respected aspect of Nepali culture, and I don’t believe it violates any of my child’s rights.”While the Kumari tradition continues, its practices have evolved. “She enjoys this normal life and it didn’t take her long to adjust as well,” says Matina’s father, on her transition from the revered Kumari to the ordinary Matina. \nWhat animals did Juddha Shumsher have in his zoo?“We only have records of animals from the mid-1960s,” says Ganesh Koirala, who has been employed at the Central Zoo for the past 36 years and currently serves as its information officer and programme officer. “That too I hand-copied from an old torn-down file that I came across.”Today, the Central Zoo, which sprawls across six hectares in Jawalakhel, Lalitpur, houses as many as 1,298 wild animals of different species of mammals, reptiles, fishes and birds from Nepal and around the world—from tiger, rhinoceros, hippopotamus and red panda to its recent attraction: a pair of chimpanzees.After enduring decades of neglect under various government bodies, with its animals and infrastructure scraping along in a deplorable state, the zoo received a new lease of life with improved infrastructure and animal care in 1995, when it came under the management of the King Mahendra Trust for Nature Conservation (KMTNC), now known as the National Trust for Nature Conservation, in 1995.Today, the Central Zoo is an entertainment venue, one of the most happening places in the Kathmandu valley. Flocked by thousands of daily visitors, the zoo now also hosts rescued animals and those in need of rehabilitation. It is also a site for conservation education.But when Juddha Shumsher Rana (prime minister from 1932–1945) built the Jawalakhel Zoological Garden on the premises of his Jawalakhel Durbar (where Nepal Administrative Staff College stands today) in 1932, he did so purely for private interests—as a space of entertainment and amusement for him and his family.Built in the semi-wilderness of Jawalakhel around a historical pond dating to the 17th century during the reign of King Siddhi Narsingh Malla, the zoo also became the space he could use to show his respect for two women he revered, his mother and sister-in-law, and indulge in one of his favourite pastimes—gambling.Today, the Central Zoo, nestled in the heart of Jawalakhel's sprawling crowd, does not go unnoticed, and its story is well told. But what passions drove Juddha to build the zoo? What was its original layout? What animals did it have in the beginning? And how did Juddha spend time there?“I remember once seeing a small board that read ‘Jawalakhel Zoological Garden’,” Koirala says. “I don’t know whether it was from Juddha’s time or was made in the later years. It must surely be that Juddha built the zoo out of influence from the British given how this term was used by them.”Koirala adds, “There is a former employee, now an elderly gentleman who worked in the zoo in the 1960s. He surely has some stories from Juddha’s time.”Birds, beasts and palacesTo trace the birth of Jawalakhel Zoological Garden, one has to look at the history of Nepal’s rulers owning birds and animals.Like rulers around the world, Nepal’s royalty kept wild and exotic birds and animals in captivity as a source of pleasure and mark of wealth and power. The book ‘Social History of Nepal’ by historians TR Vaidya, Tri Ratna Manandhar and Shankar Lal Joshi details how Mallas during the mediaeval Kathmandu Valley to Ranas and Shahs in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries owned rare, exotic creatures. In 1708, a rhinoceros in Kathmandu Valley broke the iron chain in which it was bound and killed its tamer. In 1714, Bhaktapur’s King Bhupatindra Malla gifted a camel and an elephant to Kantipur’s King Bhaskar Malla to build peace.Among Shahs, King Rana Bahadur Shah in particular was reputed for his collection of birds and animals. He also owned a zoo outside his palace in Basantapur Durbar Square, where the Nepal Bank Limited stands in New Road today. The zoo contained “tiger, bear, monkey, elephant, horse, deer… heron, peacock… pigeon, wild dogs, rabbits, rats, mongoose.”Jung Bahadur Rana’s zoo on the premises of his Thapathali Durbar hosted a variety of birds and animals collected during his hunting expeditions as well as those brought from abroad. Jung Bahadur himself used to “supervise and inspect it”. Juddha Shumsher likewise had his own collection of creatures which steadily expanded into a zoological garden. Seeking wilderness in his Jawalakhel DurbarJuddha’s biographer Ishwari Prasad writes in ‘The Life and Times of Maharaja Juddha Shumsher Jung Bahadur Rana’ that between 1933 and 1940, Juddha shot 433 tigers, 33 rhinoceros and 93 leopards. An insatiable big-game hunter, Juddha had a deep fondness for being in the wild and among wild animals, and from this came, according to oral history prevalent among members of Kathmandu’s Rana community including Juddha’s descendants, the desire to own a zoo.Built in 1752, Schönbrunn Zoo in Vienna, the world’s first modern zoo, was already over 100 years old when Juddha was born in 1875. London Zoo opened in 1828 and Alipore Zoological Garden (Kolkata Zoo) in 1875. Nawab Wajid Ali Shah Zoological Garden (Lucknow Zoo) was established in 1921. Juddha’s inspiration, his descendants say, was most likely reinforced by his tours to zoological gardens during his visits to England in 1908 and to different Indian cities.An article titled ‘Central zoo in state of neglect’ published in The Kathmandu Post in 1996 says that Juddha one day “received a pair of leopards as a gift”, cementing his desire to own a zoo. A report ‘Central Zoo Master Plan’ prepared by the KMTNC in 1996 says that Juddha decided to build a zoo in an epiphany when he saw that some animals “including deer, a few rhinos, and some tigers had been collected from the Tarai and kept in Kathmandu” could be put into one compound in the “lonely piece of land with a large 16th [sic] century Malla period Pokhari”.The pond lay still and serene surrounded by green wilderness ever since Patan’s King Siddhi Narsingh Malla built it in the 1600s. On the grounds surrounding this pond, the Newars from Na:Tole, Pulchowk and surroundings had their devisthans where, for centuries, they gathered to perform their religious ceremonies during Basanta Panchami and Bhoto Jatra even after this area fell within the Jawalakhel Durbar.For the palace, the ground served as its extended garden along with a horse and elephant stable. Subodh Rana, 69, grandson of Juddha Shumsher, recalled his father Kiran Shumsher telling him that Juddha and his family sometimes also used the scenic grounds for picnics. If there was any spot where Juddha wanted to build a menagerie, it would be around this Pokhari (pond). One day, he called his grandson General Maheshwar Shumsher Rana and deputed him to the task of doing just this.The zoo’s layout—except for the small plots of lands acquired later—that was in place when it came under KMTNC's management was, the present and retired zoo officials believe, mostly the same as it was built by Maheshwar and so offers a peek into how Juddha’s zoo must have been like. Pond in the middle of the ground surrounded by enclosures—the southern bank housing mainly larger animals, and cages for birds positioned on the northern banks.From pigeons to the king of the jungleWhat animals and birds did the enclosures at Juddha’s zoo house?“We cannot tell for sure,” Koirala says.Once it came under government ownership, the zoo was tossed from one institution to the other for lack of interest and knowledge on the right institution to manage it. Amid all this chaos, documents were possibly lost and the zoo has no concrete record about the animals that Juddha must have once taken amusement at, said Koirala.Mukti Narayan Shrestha, 82, a retired secretary of the Nepal government, joined the Central Zoo in 1970 as a veterinarian when many original structures of the zoo were still intact. Shrestha also worked with an elderly khardar who, he says, was employed in the zoo since the time of Juddha and was about to retire when he joined.“In those days where the purpose of menageries was exclusively for exhibition and pleasure with no regard for the welfare and recreation of animals and birds, the cages were tiny and iron-barred,” Shrestha says.Elephant, horses, deer, monkeys, tiger, rhinoceros, clouded leopard, red panda, bear, palm civet (nir biralo), four-horned antelope, Himalayan goral, pheasants, Himalayan monal—from the mythical and the majestic, the gentle and friendly to the fiery and ferocious, Juddha’s zoo boasted them all, Shrestha says.Shrestha’s account is not different from the anecdotes passed down to other retired and present zoo officials and the members of the Rana community, who also detail the rare and the exotic fauna, like the gharial crocodile and porcupine, even the jungle’s king—creatures, they say, that Juddha must have received from foreigners as gifts—appearing alongside domestic birds like pigeons.Tidbits of published information also confirm that the zoo had a good collection of exotic birds and animals from Nepal and abroad. One such suggestion comes from Kalyan Shumsher’s ‘Shree Teen Juddha Mahima’ published during Juddha’s reign in 1943.“One need not travel abroad to see the incredible birds and animals found in foreign countries,” he writes. “It will suffice to see [those creatures] right here in the zoo opened by His Holiness Shree 3 [Juddha] in Jawalakhel.”Among these incredible creatures, one reigned supreme—lion, the king of the jungle.For one, it would not have satiated Juddha to build a zoo and not have the jungle’s king exhibited in it. Juddha hence must have done everything possible to ensure one for the zoo. Infrastructure at the zoo suggests that the lion indeed lived at Juddha’s zoo or, in the least, during the Rana regime.“Where bear habitat lies today, there were two dome-shaped attached enclosures with a holding room, constructed in the classic architecture that many enclosures in the British zoos had in the past. They had brick walls and lime plaster,” Koirala says. “These were built to house a lion in one cage and a tiger in the other.”Near these enclosures stood another cage that remains intact today, with the head of a roaring lion carved out of the wall on the top of its iron bars. Zoo officials as well as members of the Rana community believe that Juddha had this exhibit built to specifically house a lion.Remarkably, these Juddha-era infrastructural spaces are corroborated by a rare piece of photographic evidence. A 1946 photo of the zoo shows a lion while a Kathmandu mother and her sons stand in front of its cage.Juddha’s place of piety and playThe zoo was not merely a space that Juddha sought out for amusement and retreat in the outpost of his palace; he also used this place to express his deepest affection.This affection spills right at the zoo’s entrance, in the form of the life-size statue of Karma Kumari Devi, wife of Juddha’s elder brother and Rana Prime Minister Dev Shumsher. Karma Kumari stands tall in her regal costume shaded by a wide canopy. Juddha revered Karma Kumari because it was she who raised him and looked after his mother Juhar Kumari Devi after the death of his father Dhir Shumsher. On another prominent part of the zoo on the south-east, Juhar Kumari’s enthroned statue overlooks the pond. Juddha had commissioned the London-based sculptor Domenico Antonio Tonelli to cast these statues.When Karma Kumari’s statue was unveiled is not clear, but Juhar Kumari’s statue was unveiled by Juddha amid a grand function in 1935 on Jawalakhel’s most auspicious day, Bhoto Jatra. It was attended by the British Resident Frederick Bailey.“On June 28, 1935, at Jawalakhel Durbar… the pond nearby looked very scenic,” says a Gorkhapatra news report titled ‘Statue installation’ dated July 5, 1935. “Because it was the day of Bhoto Jatra of Machhindranath… and moreover since an ideal woman’s statue was being unveiled, there was a crowd of lakhs of people.”Less than fifty metres from Karma Kumari’s statue stands a one-story building with a pagoda roof that today serves as the zoo’s meeting hall. Juddha, an avid gambler, found the scenic semi-wilderness covered in trees and filled with the sounds of wildlife to be a perfect place to relish the game. So he built a building with twelve doors on its four sides allowing him and his fellow gambling compatriots the freedom to enter through a particular door that they thought would bring luck. He called it his Juwa Ghar, the gambling house, and built it with the sole purpose of indulging in the game he loved. Roar of lion reverberates in KathmanduThe sounds of the animals and birds in the zoo rose up in the Jawalakhel sky. Every day, until much later in the 1970s, roar of the zoo’s lion (there were later other lions) diffused to far corners of the Valley, merging the zoo with the spirit of Kathmandu and informing the city folks of its presence.But was the zoo open to the public as well?“I think once it was built, the zoo was open for the public,” Subodh Rana said. “It is unlikely that Juddha Shumsher built such a large zoo and kept it only for his family.”For one, Kalyan Shumsher mentioning that one “need not travel abroad to see the incredible birds and animals found in foreign countries” suggests that the public had at least some access to the zoo. Of course, the Newar community from Na:Tole, Pulchowk and surrounding areas were permitted inside the zoo on the days of their guthi functions on Basanta Panchami and Bhoto Jatra.As the zoo was established at the back of the ground where Bhoto Jatra celebrations happen, it naturally filled with revellers on this day in addition to the guthi ritual observers as testified by the Gorkhapatra report. The photo of the mother and her sons also bear testimony that the zoo was not entirely closed to the public.What is widely believed, though, is that the zoo officially came under government ownership after Nepal became a democracy in 1951. And it would still be a few more years before it was open to the public in 1956.In 1945, Juddha gave up his power and eventually retired in Dehradun, India, where he died in 1952. With time, Jawalakhel Zoological Garden became the Central Zoo. It would take many avatars—a neglected site of crammed, unmaintained cages with sad eyes of emaciated creatures staring from behind the bars, a focal point of animal diplomacy, particularly during the period of monarchy, to, in its recent decades, a space of conservation and education.When all this was happening, the city sprawled around Jawalakhel, subduing the lion’s roar with its noise. More wildlife from around the country and the world came—creatures captured from the wild, those sold by circuses, those rescued from traffickers. Fate would bring these creatures to the care of generations of Kathmandu folks, intertwining each other’s joys and sorrows. After the tale of Juddha’s Jawalakhel Zoological Garden, there would be these stories to tell. Sitting around a table inside Juddha’s Juwa Ghar, Koirala and other zoo officials begin unfolding these stories before me. \nEarlier this week, Prime Minister and CPN-UML Chair KP Sharma Oli completed five months in office. His tango with Nepali Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba seems to be proceeding well. Over the last few months, the top leaders of Nepal’s two major political parties have been excessively focused on not offending each other, as doing so could tip the balance.Since this new coalition was formed without a clear vision, it failed to inspire confidence from the outset. Hence, on the delivery front, the Oli administration was bound to fail.The CPN-UML and the Nepali Congress decided to join forces with the promise of amending the constitution to ensure political stability. Over the past months, the two parties have offered numerous reasons for forming the coalition, but none involve the constitutional amendment issue, as if it has vanished from their agenda.Neither party has provided answers about the amendment process, likely because they don’t have one.While an amendment to the constitution is not inherently problematic, there must be a clear rationale. The justification the two parties offered was so flimsy that it was evident from the start that their amendment rhetoric was just a ruse. Even if they are committed to their promise, it remains a misguided priority. The need of the hour is addressing more urgent matters, such as good governance and service delivery, which are directly linked to citizens.Misplaced priorityNepal’s major political parties—the NC, the UML and the CPN (Maoist Centre)—seem to have little confidence in the constitution they once championed through majoritarian dominance. Dissenting voices were ignored, suppressed and silenced.They once called it the world’s best but are now finding fault with it—not because it has caused problems for the people but because it obstructs their pursuit of majority governments. At least, this has been the argument of the UML and the Congress of late because they are the largest parties and are aiming for a majority in the next elections. Nevertheless, once promulgated, it was incumbent upon Nepali parties to focus on full implementation of the constitution. This required following due processes—enacting laws, devolving power and strengthening institutions. However, none of the parties paid attention to these fundamentals. Instead, they treated the constitution as a tool to “rule” when the charter required them to “govern.”Post-2015, Nepali parties had only two key responsibilities—governance and constitution implementation. They failed on both fronts, especially because they were excessively involved in the game of one-upmanship. These key duties were thus relegated to the back burner.Spirit of the constitutionA pluralist, inclusive, progressive and peaceful society was the core idea of the constitution. But this very spirit is under threat from the parties that are supposed to safeguard it, as they have failed to internalise the concept of constitutionalism in its true sense.Nepali politicians often cite the holding of two sets of national, provincial and local elections within the prescribed timeframe and the formation of governments to argue that democracy is functioning in Nepal. While this reasoning has merit, democracy’s full functionality depends on its realisation at the grassroots and among the people.True upholding of constitutionalism means abiding by its principles, respecting its limitations and adhering to the rule of law. Only then can the pluralistic, inclusive and progressive society envisioned by the constitution be built.Stable and accountable governance entails adherence to the rule of law, the protection of individual rights and the separation of powers.But questions remain: Have successive governments, regardless of which parties or leaders led them, fully complied with the laws? Has the system of checks and balances been allowed to operate fully in both letter and spirit?Constitutional moralityTrue implementation of the constitution depends on constitutionalism, which itself is rooted in constitutional morality—embracing not just legal provisions but also the underlying democratic values of justice, equality and respect for individual rights. Unfortunately, this idea—that the constitution is not just a guidebook setting the rules but a moral document—is sorely lacking among Nepali parties and politicians.The waning morality among Nepali parties has emerged as a troubling trend. Their pursuit of power and self-interest takes precedence over addressing citizens’ concerns. Since the UML and the Congress—historically rival parties—formed the new coalition, they have started floating the idea of a two-party system. While this notion is unlikely to materialise anytime soon, it does indicate their broader aim. Beneath the veneer of their argument for stability through a two-party system lies a dangerous intent to muzzle multi-party democracy, one of the basic tenets of the constitution, and to rule in turns.Coupled with this is yet another worrying concern: Internal democracy has been on the wane within Nepali political parties. Majoritarianism rules the roost in major parties, raising the risk that the same approach will manifest when they come to power. Democracy thrives when institutions are strong, but they have been weakened by the parties’ disregard for the separation of powers. Weak institutions, a lack of morality and an utter disregard for the rule of law create the perfect conditions for majoritarian tendencies to rear their ugly head.‘We, the People’The most worrying issue today is that political parties do not want to confront the most pressing issues of the day, which actually concern the people.While they harp on the constitution—and even warn that the statute is under threat—they ignore the fact that it will continue to face risks as long as they fail to ensure that the spirit of the charter resonates with ordinary people.The worry today is not just that Nepali parties are falling short on the delivery front; it is that the gains made so far could be in danger.The incumbent UML-Congress coalition, if genuinely committed to the welfare of ordinary citizens, must pause and reassess its priorities. Their survival and political relevance depend on embracing the politics of citizenry and addressing the pressing needs of the people they are meant to serve.Lest they forget, the ultimate power rests with “We, the People,” as the constitution declares. \nPrint journalism is in a state of crisis. The circulation of newspapers in India seems to have stagnated in relation to population growth, meaning the proportion of people reading printed news has dropped. More readers are turning to free online news sources and circulation growth is failing to keep up with demographic expansion. Given India’s vast population—nearly 10 times that of Japan—it is concerning that India has only as many newspapers with over a million in circulation as Japan.If this decline in print journalism is not addressed, it could as well pose a serious threat to the fundamental values of our democracy. The potential consequences of this decline are too grave to ignore. There is no such thing as free news, just as there is no such thing as a free lunch. Free online news is not truly free; it comes with hidden costs, such as algorithms similar to those on social media—that prioritise sensationalist stories, fuelling misinformation and polarisation. ‘Brain rot’, named Oxford Word of the Year 2024, is defined as “the supposed deterioration of a person’s mental or intellectual state, especially viewed as the result of overconsumption of material (now particularly online content) considered to be trivial or unchallenging.” The usage of the word saw an increase of 230 percent in its frequency from 2023 to 2024. Oxford University Press’s announcement of the Word of the Year sparked debate about the potential negative impact of excessive online content consumption on mental health, particularly in children and young people. According to Newport Institute in the US, one brain rot behaviour is doom scrolling, involving long periods of searching for negative and distressing news online; and consequences include difficulty organising information, solving problems, making decisions, and recalling information. The Institute advises, “Don’t succumb to sensationalistic and negative news. Diversify your media sources so you maintain a more balanced world perspective.” Unlike online outlets focused on short, click-driven pieces, print newspapers offer curated in-depth coverage of current events. The details that could be captured by such reporting are things the small articles or social media posts dominating the digital landscape will never be able to capture. Printed newspapers have kept high editorial standards and leave a permanent record that is also transparent. Digital stories, by contrast, can be edited, removed or simply lost. In an era where fake news spreads rapidly on social media, print newspapers remain a trusted source of verified information. Japan’s strong newspaper circulation demonstrates the enduring value of print media. Leading dailies like Yomiuri Shimbun and Asahi Shimbun sell millions of daily copies. This cultural preference for physical newspapers is reflected in the popularity of newspaper clubs, found in schools, universities and community centres. By discussing and analysing news stories, members of these clubs develop deep appreciation for journalism and learn to be active, responsible citizens, which is crucial for a healthy democracy. Commonly, online news platforms use algorithms that only feed the users news they are already interested in, reducing exposure to a broader range of information. This trend undermines the financial viability of traditional media while promoting a media landscape dominated by clickbait reporting. Ironically, when print newspapers disappear, the future of online news is also at stake. The sustainability of digital journalism depends on the investigative and qualitative reporting that traditional print media does. Without print outlets holding power to account and investing in journalism, the quality of online news could significantly decline, littered with sensationalism and disinformation. Australia has recognised this challenge and taken bold initiatives to protect journalism. In 2021, Australia introduced the Treasury Laws Amendment (News Media and Digital Platforms Mandatory Bargaining Code) Act 2021 a world-first legislation aimed at helping to sustain public interest journalism. The law requires tech giants like Google and Facebook to pay news organisations for sharing their content. Australia’s success motivated other nations: Canada and Indonesia are planning similar codes. During his National Press Day address, Union Minister of Information and Broadcasting Ashwini Vaishnaw remarked that traditional content must be fairly compensated to preserve its value. India should follow Australia’s example by ensuring tech platforms pay for news content while media houses promote affordable digital subscriptions to compete with free aggregators. The government and media need to act together. We must recognise the value of paying for credible news, particularly by subscribing to print newspapers. Purchasing a newspaper supports quality journalism and ensures that high standards of reporting continue. A national campaign should be launched to encourage every household in India to subscribe to at least one print newspaper. Campaigns could include media literacy programmes highlighting the risks of free online news and the importance of investing in credible sources. Increased circulation boosts advertising revenue, providing newspapers with resources to fund high-quality journalism. Participating in democracy is not just about casting a vote—it is about staying informed and supporting credible journalism. It is time for a campaign encouraging every home in India to subscribe to a print newspaper, as the future of our democracy depends on it. Madhav is a transparency and equality advocate and an author.—The Statesman (India) / ANN \nCorruption ails almost every sector in Nepal. It is believed to be one major factor discouraging investors, innovators, entrepreneurs, as well as service seekers. But following tremendous pressure from various sections of the society, government authorities have initiated investigations on some major corruption cases. The fake Bhutanese refugee scam, Lalita Niwas land grab, Tribhuvan University land encroachment, gold smuggling and cooperatives deposits embezzlement are cases that have been probed. Even high profile personalities such as a former Speaker, former ministers, top bureaucrats and powerful middlemen have been prosecuted.Currently, the embezzlement of billions of rupees deposited by thousands of people at hundreds of cooperatives across the country remains a hotly-debated issue. Politicians, a former top police official, and key officials running dozens of cooperatives are being investigated. Police have issued red corner notices against those who are on the run after embezzling deposits from various cooperatives. The Rastriya Swatantra Party chair and former home minister Rabi Lamichhane, among other suspects, has been in custody for the past two months over his alleged involvement in the embezzlement. But other politicians and individuals close to top political leaders have been spared, it is alleged, under political pressure. Just like Lamichhane, Nepali Congress Vice-President and lawmaker Dhan Raj Gurung, and federal parliament’s Public Accounts Committee chair Rishikesh Pokharel of the CPN-UML have been linked to the cases of embezzlement of funds from different cooperatives. Yet they were not being probed. Thankfully, there has been a breakthrough. The Morang District Court on Tuesday issued an arrest warrant against 25 suspects including Anjala Koirala, wife of PAC chair Pokharel, in connection with alleged financial irregularities in Uma-Gauri Agricultural Cooperative. Yet little seems to be happening in the case against Gurung. The Central Investigation Bureau of Nepal Police had in October recommended the police headquarter issue a red notice against Gurung’s former wife Jyoti, among others, on charges of embezzling cooperative deposits. Though Dhan Raj and Jyoti officially appear to have divorced, it seems the two were still jointly misusing funds even after the formal divorce. Also, the cross-party Parliamentary Special Probe Committee has suggested the authorities investigate the Congress leader’s involvement.When it comes to past investigations in major corruption scandals, the results have been mixed. The investigation agencies have produced some laudable results in a few cases, while they were criticised in other scams for sparing politicians while punishing civil servants and other individuals. So people still doubt their role. Many people believe investigating agencies, under pressure from influential leaders, first spare the politicians and their kin or, even if they are arrested, the cases against them are watered down to help the suspects get clean chit. Though cases were filed against high profile individuals in the fake refugee case, Lalita Niwas and gold smuggling scams, many of them have already been acquitted. People are thus rightly suspicious. To remove their doubts, first, the agencies should show the courage to work independently and stop waiting for signals from top politicians. Or the flawed justice process will backfire on the top politicians too. If the public comes to see that only those without access to power centres get punished while those close to top politicians and other power centres are spared, their faith in the country’s legal process will erode. So will their trust in the political parties. Now that investigation has started against the spouse of an UML leader, there should now be no delay in probing the Congress leader too.   \nFor years, politics has taken precedence over progress in Nepal’s higher education. Political parties have turned educational institutions into their playgrounds, weakening the foundation and values of these establishments. This is evident in the recent hullabaloo over the appointment of deans at Tribhuvan University (TU), Nepal’s oldest. The dean positions were vacant since June this year, and disagreements in the executive council over the selections had hindered the selection process before Dashain. The major political parties and their student unions did their best to manipulate the merit-based appointment system, while criticising each other for ‘politicising’ higher education. The tug-of-war between the parties finally ended with the appointment of deans in five study institutes and three faculties of the university. However, these appointments have once again laid bare the practice of bhagbanda between the CPN-UML, the Nepali Congress, and the CPN (Maoist Centre).For fair selection, the executive council issued procedures for appointing deans and formed recommendation committees to suggest candidates based on merit. However, these committees have no more than symbolic value in a country where corruption seeps into the very systems intended to eradicate it. When vice-chancellor Keshar Jung Baral tried to appoint the deans and campus chiefs based on “meritocracy”, the recommendation committee did not rank professors affiliated with the UML on top. This did not please the UML and Baral was criticised at the University’s senate meeting. Although the UML’s protest reflects its vested interests, Baral’s claim of merit-based dean recommendation is contaminated by his own controversial past, raising doubts over his intent. In February, then-Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal had appointed Baral as vice-chancellor even though he was second in line after Chitra Bahadur Budhathoki.To sum up, meritocracy was seen only on paper, as wherever there was political interest, selections weren’t based on merit. Ultimately this time, three Congress-affiliated professors, and two each from the UML and the Maoist Centre, were appointed deans, in addition to one with no clear political ties. It is now well established that politicisation of higher education does a lot of harm. Once renowned for its academic excellence, India’s Jawaharlal Nehru University has devolved into a hotspot for political unrest, with strikes and protests harming its academic standing. Similarly, Karachi University in Pakistan has suffered a lot from political polarisation, resulting in on-campus violence and administrative blunders.The logic is straightforward: Those who have mastered academia are best equipped to understand and manage educational institutions. However, such reasoning does not work in Tribhuvan University, where the chancellor, the highest-ranking official in the university, is the prime minister. Although the universities’ laws authorise the prime minister, as an ex-officio chancellor, to appoint vice-chancellors from among the three names recommended by the search committees, the prime minister typically appoints individuals aligned with their party, triggering a domino effect that ultimately undermines the merit-based system. Such unnatural appointments to major positions in educational institutions in turn disrupt the university’s intellectual ecosystem. It is high time we got to the root of politicisation of education and nipped it in the bud. The political parties cannot be allowed to use educational institutions as an extension of party organisations and risk the future of hundreds of thousands of students. At a time when we are witnessing a mass exodus of students due to their increasing distrust in our higher education, political parties must step aside and allow those who understand the institutions the best to lead. It is about time we created an education system that works for the benefit of students rather than politicians. \nEvery year, the Everest region, one of Nepal’s major tourist hubs, draws thousands of mountaineers, trekkers, and high-end (luxury) tourists from the world over. Helicopter sightseeing, which is as popular as trekking and mountain climbing, caters to tourists willing to spend generously to get a close glimpse of Mount Everest, the tallest mountain in the world. Such sightseeing adventures also significantly benefit hotels, airlines, local businesses and the country’s overall economy. However, starting January 1, 2025, the Sagarmatha National Park has decided to impose a blanket ban on helicopter sightseeing tours in the region. This has sparked an acrimonious debate among stakeholders.This seemingly lucrative tourism practice has a darker side. While helicopters support tourism in the national park and surrounding region, they are harmful to the wild animals living in the park’s relatively undisturbed areas. According to official data, there are over 6,000 chopper flights in the Everest region during spring and autumn—the peak tourist seasons. These flights cause excessive noise pollution and disrupt the wildlife’s feeding and breeding patterns. Low-flying helicopters are particularly dangerous to the Himalayan Tahr and Himalayan Goral. According to park sources, some animals are dying by jumping off the cliffs due to the abrupt, loud noises of the choppers. Others are fleeing their natural habitats and straying into nearby villages where they pose challenges to local communities. Thus the park’s concern about wildlife is understandable. It is also home to the world’s rarest species, including snow leopards and red pandas. The protection of these animals cannot be overlooked as it helps maintain biodiversity and contributes to wildlife tourism. According to park officials, other reasons, including haphazard landing of the copters and suspicion of transport of wildlife contraband also prompted them to take such an action. However, the abrupt and arbitrary manner in which the ban was imposed is concerning as it will affect the region’s tourism. Tour operators, helicopter companies, as well as the Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal, the country’s civil aviation regulator, have criticised the ban made without consultations and exploration of alternatives. The CAAN has also clarified that the park has no legal basis to enforce such a ban.Nepal’s tourism sector is still in the post-Covid recovery phase. To make things worse, the European Union has extended its ban on Nepali airlines. Entrepreneurs who have invested in tourism are still suffering big losses. At this juncture, high-end tourism products like helicopter sightseeing could be a lifesaver for the ailing industry. So rather than blaming each other, the park and civil aviation authorities should try to find common ground and opt for a more balanced approach. As experts have suggested, establishing designated flight corridors away from sensitive wildlife habitats or conservation areas could be a viable solution to cut noise pollution. If concerns of the national park authority related to contraband and haphazard landings are genuine, monitoring activities in the region should be strengthened, and the aviation watchdog should hold the operators involved accountable. Wildlife and tourism are lifelines of our economy and there is a need to maintain a calibrated balance between the two. We believe, with a little more thought, a way can be worked out for them to coexist.  \nMany of Nepal’s online media outlets seem to be peddling more misinformation than news. The social media likewise is littered with content that more often divides than it connects people. So it should be great news that the Cabinet has given its go-ahead to a bill to regulate online content. Without some regulation, the government argues, things could soon get out of hand: With communities fighting each other, national sovereignty coming under threat and the society heading towards total anarchy. But that is just one side of the picture. What we have seen in recent times is successive governments trying to stifle free speech in the name of regulation. Look beyond the gloss of ‘safeguarding the society’, and the goal seems to control anti-government narratives. Otherwise, such laws would precede broad consultations with relevant stakeholders in the media and civil society. Those who have seen the bill say some of its provisions will give unelected government bodies great discretion to decide what is appropriate to be posted online. There is as such plenty of room for abuse. Yet the government seems intent on promulgating it at the earliest. Minister for Information and Communication Prithvi Subba Gurung has been pushing Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli to enact it through an ordinance. As he puts it, “It is already too late to regulate online media”. That would be unwise. Yes, there is a lot of noise online, and it is often hard to separate fact from fiction, confusing and frustrating people. This is why judicious regulation of online content is vital. Yet we should always keep in mind that when it comes to regulating free speech, less is more. Once you start nitpicking about what is socially acceptable content and what is not, it can be a slippery slope towards full-blown control. Whatever its other demerits, Nepal today stands tall as the freest country in South Asia where opinions from all political and social shades can be fearlessly voiced. This is something the country should cherish and look to capitalise on. One reason Nepal has not gone the Bangladesh way despite a similar level of public resentment against its political class is that at least Nepali citizens get to freely vent their frustrations. On the other hand, the draconian repression on free speech in Bangladesh had created a pressure cooker of discontent that ultimately exploded. Even in other parts of South Asia, there has been a steady erosion of free public space in the name of security, religion or social harmony. Nepal must avoid this at all costs. Historically, we have been perhaps the most tolerant society in South Asia, with the kind of religious and sectarian strife seen in other parts of the region rarely seen here. What has certainly increased by leaps and bounds is the online trolling of top political leaders and expressions of scepticism of all things associated with the government. But those in the government, instead of introspecting about why they have become so unpopular, seem rather intent on stifling the medium for the dissemination of their misdeeds and misgovernance. They should realise that often what transpires online is only a symptom of an underlying malady. It would be foolish to try to treat the symptom while ignoring the disease. \nIt has been five months since the Nepali Congress and the CPN-UML formed a coalition government on July 15 by stepping on the seven-point deal inked on July 1. How is the coalition of the two biggest political parties faring? The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal sat down with Krishna Khanal, a professor of political science, for his insights.How do you evaluate the performance of the Congress-UML government based on the pledges they made at the time of coalition formation?Two biggest parties getting together to form a government is a bit unusual in the system we have adopted. The strength of the system is that the government can be made accountable by a strong opposition. But when the two biggest parties join hands to run the government, the opposition in the House becomes weak. This is a concern. The Congress and the UML have had joint governments in critical junctures in the past. Now, there is no extraordinary situation requiring them to forge a coalition but they justified it saying it would end political instability. Their argument was that unreasonable bargaining of smaller parties made the prime ministers weak. That’s partially true. However, the crux of the matter is that they wanted to enjoy consolidated power. KP Oli wanted to be prime minister and the Congress leaders who were out of power wanted to return to Singha Durbar. So they signed the seven-point deal with the pledge of amending the constitution.Has this coalition been a success? What are the initial indications?There are certain curious things. The seven-point agreement doesn’t say the UML will hand over government leadership to the Congress in the second phase of their partnership. It says, after two years, UML chair Oli will hand it over to Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba. It shows how our parties have become leader-centric instead of institution-centric. After all, Oli and Deuba are the chiefs and parliamentary leaders of their respective parties and they are the ones who will lead the government. Still they wished to specifically mention their names, which indicates they still feel insecure. Likewise, Prime Minister Oli says that he is handing over power to Deuba in July 2026. Recently he said he is handing it over after 18 months. Despite there being a written agreement, he keeps repeating the timeline. This suggests mutual mistrust due to past records of betrayal. It is true that the Congress and the UML together have a strong majority in the House and, with the backing of a few other smaller forces, they can manage two-thirds majority needed to amend the constitution. But when it comes to political issues, even the small parties in the coalition are hardly on the same page. So numerical strength alone won’t work. Hence there has been no progress on constitution amendment in the past five months. These pledges were made just to create a pretext to get to power.Is the present government any different to the erstwhile Dahal-led coalition, particularly on delivery?No. In the seven-point agreement, they pledged to improve the ailing economy. We don’t find any reform and the economy is still stagnant. I can’t recall a single thing this government has done that is worth appreciating. The only thing this coalition has achieved is ending unusual power manoeuverings by Prachanda [Maoist Centre chair Pushpa Kamal Dahal]. The way Dahal was switching alliance partners between the Congress and the UML was unnatural. The present coalition ended the trend, at least for now. Also, some unhealthy activities taking place in provinces have been stopped. But the government has utterly failed to provide any relief to the people. What about the process of amending the constitution?The Congress and the UML leaders have often blamed the proportional representation (PR) electoral system for the country’s political instability. The UML proposed to limit the scope of the PR system to the National Assembly and some Congress leaders have also floated this idea. After the formation of this government, many people assumed that this coalition may take some action to implement those propositions. But doing so is not easy. Despite a strong majority in the House, the Congress and the UML alone can’t amend the constitution. Other small parties won’t support them to water down the PR system. The top leaders are conspicuously silent as they know diverse issues are going to open up once they start the process. For instance, the Rastriya Prajatantra Party wants to revive Hindu monarchy and the Madhes-based parties have their own grievances. Moreover, if you analyse the election results since 2008, it’s not difficult to infer that not only small parties but even the major forces will think twice before making any changes to the PR system. Be it big or small, old or new parties, all have gotten a significant number of seats under the PR category. In the first Constituent Assembly election in 2008, the Congress and the UML were in crisis. It was the PR system that saved them from being pushed into an existential crisis. Besides that, there is one big political reason behind the adoption of this electoral system and that is to ensure representation of various underprivileged communities in state organs. We can’t forget that context. Hence the Congress and UML leaders have been silent on the constitution amendment in the past couple of months.Is there any need to review or amend the constitution?There is a need to seriously review and analyse the problems faced in the course of implementing the constitution in the past nine years. For instance, the vice-president has no role. He can be made ex-officio chair of the National Assembly, as in India. Then, the state doesn’t need to elect the upper house chair. This option was discussed during constitution writing as well. Recently, we conducted by-polls to fill the vacant positions of chiefs of local units. These polls were unnecessary as there can be a provision to entrust the deputy chiefs with the responsibility of carrying out the chief’s duties when the position goes vacant. There is a need for a comprehensive review and changes in some provisions based on the practical experience of statute implementation. But there are different parties and groups that want to raise different political agendas. For instance, some want a more powerful federal system while others want to scrap the system and revive Hindu monarchy. How should we review the national charter and what kind of mechanism will be right for that?The best way is through a review commission composed of politicians and subject experts. But leaders don’t trust independent experts who don’t follow their instructions. Forming a body of experts loyal to the leaders is meaningless. Therefore, a special parliamentary committee can be entrusted with this task. The panel will be composed of members from political parties based on their strength in the House. The parties and other stakeholders can submit their formal proposals to the committee and the experts can give their inputs to the same panel. The body can help give shape to the ongoing debates and discussions will take place in a more organised and formal way. It can conduct a thorough study of the complications seen in the course of constitution implementation. My emphasis is not on amending the constitution on political grounds but from the perspectives of removing difficulties experienced in the course of implementation. For instance, provinces have failed to prove their relevance. Now, we need to study where the problems are. But I don’t think the political parties are going to work on this issue with the seriousness it deserves. Leaders, of late, have proposed to increase the threshold to secure seats under the PR category, which can be done by amending election laws. They have floated the idea of increasing the PR threshold to five percent. [At present, it is three percent at the federal and 1.5 percent at the provincial level]. If it is increased to five percent, hardly four or five political parties may qualify for the PR seats. So this is not an appropriate proposal. To ensure political stability, we have to instead develop a system supportive of a coalition culture. The problem lies in our leaders and not in the constitution. For instance, why did Prachanda switch alliances multiple times after the last election? There is no point in blaming the system for instability. To discuss and debate all these issues, we need a review body.What is your analysis of the recent local by-polls results?The voting pattern shows that the big parties couldn’t increase their vote shares and failed to attract voters. The Congress lost more seats in comparison to the last by-polls. The UML had mixed results while the Maoist Centre made some gains. As it fought single-handedly this time, the Congress lost some seats that it had won with the support of alliance partners last time. This is natural. The Maoist Centre appears to have benefitted by being in the opposition and as it concentrated its strengths in select areas for the past few months. Party chief Dahal himself visited some remote local units. The Congress doesn’t appear serious about reviewing its poor performance while the UML has decided to study the matter and find what went wrong. The Maoist leaders look excited but the party has not made much progress in popular votes. There are assumptions of some informal collaborations between the Maoist Centre and the Rastriya Swatantra Party. The way Dahal has defended Rabi Lamichhane in recent days backs the assumption.Why do you think the performance of new forces including the RSP and Janamat were poor in the by-polls?My assumption is that voters rethought the need to change the party of their choice if the main objective of the leaders from new parties is to be ministers. RSP chief Rabi Lamichhane insisted on becoming home minister. In the meantime, recent investigations have shown his linkages to cooperative scams. People might have thought that he is not a clean person. These factors might have played a role. Last time, people supported new forces not to make their leaders ministers but for political reforms. The chief minister from Janamat Party who is leading the provincial government in Madhesh formed a 20-member Cabinet, which is the biggest ever there. He downsized it only after severe criticism. Such developments certainly play a role in elections. These are just assumptions. We can’t jump to conclusions but it is safe to say that Nepali voters are consistently trying to find better alternatives.While there were reports of former President Bidya Devi Bhandari rejoining the UML to return to active politics, former Vice-President Nanda Bahadur Pun is most likely to join the Maoist Centre. What kind of precedent will this set?I don’t see serious problems in former vice-presidents rejoining active politics as they don’t play any vital role as vice-presidents. But the issue of former Presidents returning to active politics is serious as such a precedent will invite serious anomalies. Though the constitution and laws don't bar former presidents from making such a comeback, politics should be guided by certain values, principles and convictions. Bhandari’s return to active politics will be unfortunate. It should be stopped. \nPrime Minister KP Sharma Oli returned home on December 5 after a four-day official visit to China. During the visit, the two countries signed the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) Framework Cooperation agreement. The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal sat down with Bishnu Rimal, chief advisor to the prime minister, who was one of the key interlocutors during the framework agreement negotiations, for insights on how the deals were finalised between the two countries.There are many queries about the details of the agreements signed between Nepal and China last week. Please tell us about the key points.Nepal and China had been exchanging documents related to the Belt and Road Initiative of China since 2020, under the BRI implementation plan. While signing any agreement, the two countries engage in rigorous negotiations and at times it takes a long time even to finalise a word. This time, we signed a framework agreement, which is like a basket, where we have put many things. It’s different from a memorandum of understanding (MoU). In the agreement, we have described its background, principles, objectives, the modality of mobilising financial resources and implementing mechanisms. Even the previous government led by Pushpa Kamal Dahal had planned to finalise it but it didn’t in the end. Now we have taken it ahead. The new agreement should be understood in a context. In 2016, we were in government [during Oli’s first tenure] and we visited Beijing. At the time, China was supporting Nepal through the Trans-Himalayan Multi-Dimensional Connectivity Network (THMDCN) package. Later, the support was provided through the BRI and the THMDCN became a part of it. Nepal reached an MoU to this effect in 2017. After that, an implementation plan needed to be signed. Following the formation of the present government, we held discussions on this. The two major coalition partners—the Nepali Congress and the CPN-UML—formed a four-member team for this specific purpose. Party general secretary Gagan Thapa and lawyer Semanta Dahal from the Nepali Congress and Yubaraj Khatiwada ji and myself from the UML were in the team. In the past, we have reached several agreements with China, India, the United States, Japan and various other countries and sought support from them. But we haven’t been able to properly utilise the support. Our [taskforce’s] focus was to ensure best use of the pledged amount and implement the agreements. At first, we studied the documents exchanged after 2020. At the beginning we forged consensus between the UML and the Congress and then shared the document with the Chinese side because it can only be implemented after it is acceptable for both sides. This time, we wanted to take the implementation process ahead because Nepal joined the BRI process years ago. Nepal has already joined China’s Global Development Initiative, which is an international development concept. But there were some confusions about our participation in development projects under the BRI. There needed to be more clarity on our side. At times, it has been dragged into controversy. We wanted to dispel rumours and confusions.First of all we all should know that the BRI is a framework and the agreement we signed is a basket deal. Later, we will select specific projects and negotiate on particular details and conditions. In fact, the debate ahead of the prime minister’s visit was driven by whether to take loans or grants from China. That was wrong. It is rather a project-based approach. On certain projects, we need all grants while on certain others, we may jointly develop them. Still in other projects, we have to seek concessional loans. All these things depend on what project we are talking about. If a project can pay back the loan, that could be dealt accordingly. But our discussions were driven by the concept of loan versus grant. Even top leaders got swayed by such narratives and reacted accordingly. China has declared huge grants to Nepal multiple times since 2016. But we haven’t been able to use them as we have to earmark the amounts and seek them. First, we have to say that we are going to use this money in these projects. We at the task force concluded that the amount of the grants pledged by China is enough for us for now. There is no need to take out a loan now. Our priority is to get the grants that have been stuck for years. Do we need to select certain projects for that?Yes, we have to first finalise the projects and prepare business plans. We can explore other options only if the grant money is insufficient for a particular project. For instance, if we start working on a cross-border railway, we would discuss whether the grant money is sufficient and whether to seek more grants or go for loans. We aren’t in that stage now. We are yet to receive the grant announced during the visit of Chinese President Xi Jinping in 2019. Similarly, grants were announced during the China visits of then President Bidya Devi Bhandari, first President Rambaran Yadav and our prime minister KP Sharma Oli. Also, this time, the Chinese President has announced 500 million RMB in assistance. So, again, first we have to work to receive and use the grant money. For instance, recently, the Chinese side announced to provide electric vehicles worth US$10 million as support through the Chinese embassy. The EVs include public buses, ambulances and school vans but they release them only after we provide the specifications of the vehicles that we need. The amount we sign as a budgetary support can be used wherever we want but other sums are released only after we earmark them for certain projects. After a long negotiation, Nepal and China have agreed on the term ‘aid assistance financing’. What does that mean?During the negotiation, we had used the term ‘grant and different financing modalities’. Later, we agreed to replace the word ‘grant’ with ‘aid’. We did so as we wanted to keep the door open in terms of seeking support from a country. If we say that we won’t receive any support except grants, it creates complications in the overall investment scenario. The Chinese government may provide a certain amount of grant to the government of Nepal but it doesn’t give it to the private sector.If Nepal’s private sector plans to attract investment from China, the World Bank, the ADB or any other agencies, for example for a mega hydro project, they may not get it as the Chinese side knows that Nepal accepts only grants and no other form of investment. Such a condition creates complications as this agreement is applicable even for the private sector. Therefore, we didn’t want to close the door. We can’t say we accept loans from this country but not from the other. We accept assistance that serves our national interest.Will the negotiations now onward be project-specific then?Yes. It will be project and proposal specific. Such issues will be negotiated only when we discuss a certain project. Therefore, the ongoing debate over grants versus loan is pointless. For instance, we didn’t receive certain portions of the assistance announced by India immediately after the 2015 earthquakes. Such is also the case with China and with other countries on occasions as the conditions attached to them weren’t acceptable to us.After the failure in operating Pokhara Regional International Airport due to lack of business plans, people are now suspicious about the utilisation of any assistance fruitfully.How can you say the Pokhara airport project is a failure? First, one should study the airport’s capacity and check how many passengers are flying to Pokhara now. A good number of people are flying there. I think the interest rate on the loan we took from China to build the airport is no different to the rate we receive from the World Bank, the IMF and other multilateral agencies. We can debate whether we have been able to operate the airport in its full capacity. But there is no need to scandalise it unnecessarily.Ahead of the prime minister’s visit, there were voices that Nepal should seek a waiver of Pokhara airport loan from China. What happened?Let me ask you a question. Imagine, you took a loan from Rastriya Banijya Bank to meet your needs. Say, there is a government led by a leader who favours you. Can the prime minister waive off your bank loan? No. You have to follow the system. So your question is wrong. The Pokhara airport deal is not a grant. It’s a commercial deal. Those who run the government can’t use the language of Durga Prasai, who threatens not to pay back bank loans. What are the agreements on road connectivity and cross-border railway projects?We have included five points under the infrastructure-urban development project. These are Tokha-Chhahare Tunnel, Hilsa Simkot Road Project, Kathmandu-Khandbari Road, Kimathanka Bridge, the cross-border railway project from Rasuwagadhi to Kathmandu and the Amargadhi City Hall. Likewise, we have included a cross-border transmission line to start energy trade with China. Under education and health, we agreed to establish universities and colleges. The Chinese side is carrying out a feasibility study of the railway project with a plan to complete it by 2026. Once the study is complete, we will discuss the funding modalities and business plans.What is the status of the Tokha-Chhahare tunnel project?The China side is in a position to complete its feasibility study. After that, construction work will start.Nepal has signed so many agreements with China. While we have progressed a lot on paper, there is little progress on the ground. Will the present agreement make any substantive change in this connection?Nepal is behind on monitoring and follow up. We should have formed bilateral mechanisms and monitored work progress. Now, there is a sense of urgency in the government to expedite development works. An inter-agency mechanism will be formed within our government. It will monitor and facilitate the work and the line ministries will execute the plans.Why are the agreements signed with China not made public, unlike the deals inked with other countries?There is no problem in making them public because there is nothing to hide. But all agreements aren’t made public. The MCC Compact had to be taken to the parliament as people were divided over it. Then, it was publicly debated. Likewise, people are now expressing their curiosity towards the BRI documents. But there are many projects people don’t care about. When needed, the documents can be made public as nothing can be hidden these days. And there is nothing wrong in making them public.UMl’s coalition partner Congress was reportedly reluctant to sign the framework agreement. What was its concern?That is a wrong narrative. Both the UML and the Congress were on the same page. It was possible to conclude the agreements because we had consensus.But the Congress leaders expressed their concerns in public ahead of the visit and even after the signing of the deals.We have to follow the party’s official decisions, not the statements of individual leaders. How would it have been possible to reach agreements if there were differences in the two-party taskforce, in the leadership and the party’s official positions? It’s a Nepal-China agreement jointly done by the UML and the Congress, and backed by all other parties. The prime minister convened a meeting of former prime ministers and foreign ministers ahead of his visit. All of them advised the prime minister to sign the agreement with China. Why was the signing of the agreement delayed?While signing a bilateral agreement, we can’t think only from our perspective. Negotiation always takes long. The joint statement has stated that the two sides are ready to sign the BRI framework as soon as possible. It took time for us to share the documents with the Chinese side after we reached Beijing. It’s not like two leaders just sit, discuss and sign on that. They have to consult concerned ministries, departments and officials. The Chinese worked overnight after we submitted the documents. My impression is that the Chinese side showed magnanimity and adopted a short-cut approach and signed on the deals. They were ready to sign the agreements on our conditions. That was a wonderful gesture.What were the specific points of contention and how were they resolved?We substantially edited the documents that were exchanged in the past, making them more specific and converting them into a framework of cooperation. Therefore, the Chinese side needed at least a day to study them. They argued that it would work even without mentioning the word ‘grant’. In view of the narratives in Nepal, we proposed to use ‘grant’ or a word with similar meaning. Then, we proposed ‘aid assistance financing’, and they accepted the term.How will the new deal be implemented?There used to be confusion about whether a certain project is under the BRI. China said even the Pokhara airport project is under the BRI while we said it was initiated before that. Now onward, all projects with China will be under the BRI cooperation. All the financing and investments from China will enter Nepal through the BRI window. We will prioritise the projects already proposed and under study such as the railway project, Tokha-Chhahare tunnel, and Madan Bhandari University. We have agreed to strengthen connectivity on border points and work will be expedited there. That will help transform Nepal from a land-locked into a land-linked country.Why are the projects being developed with Chinese involvement so slow?These days the Chinese side tells us to give projects only after clearing the sites. For instance, the 17-km Syafrubeshi-Rasuwagadhi road is to be built by Chinese grants. There is one transmission pole standing in the way. We are yet to remove it from the construction site. They haven’t started the work citing the same reason. Creating an environment to work on the field is our responsibility. It’s not that only China-built projects are slow. Such is also the story with our projects with other countries and agencies. Even in the case of the MCC projects, it took a long time to finalise many issues. We are too slow in implementing agreements and executing projects. First, we have to do some retrospection and improve our efficiency.  \nWang Peng, a research fellow from the Institute of State Governance at Huazhong University, Wuhan, was previously Deputy Secretary-General of the National Academy of Belt and Road Green Development (NABRGD) Beijing. Peng, a keen observer of South Asian geopolitics, was recently in Kathmandu to participate in ‘Kantipur Conclave-2024’. He sat down with the Post’s Purushottam Poudel and Kantipur’s Jagdishor Panday to discuss a host of issues. Excerpt:How have Nepal-China relations evolved in recent times? Generally, bilateral ties between Nepal and China have been stable. Politically, China’s Nepal policy has been stable too. Even though the administration in Nepal has changed, Kathmandu still has a stable and friendly policy towards China. Relations are progressing steadily. But we still have room for progress. Nepal’s Prime Minister is visiting China in the first week of December. This is a perfect opportunity for the Nepali and Chinese governments to enhance mutual understanding and political trust. Face-to-face meetings between the leaders of two countries are crucial. Due to the Himalayas, many Chinese people, including me, consider Nepal a country far away. But actually, we are alongside each other, not far. Nepal is an hour’s distance from Lasha and a few hours from Chengdu, which is very close. Despite being a close neighbour, China is often accused of not investing enough in Nepal, at least as compared to its other neighbours. Why is this so? There is no need to compare countries as every country has its own conditions. China’s investment in Nepal is significant, especially considering Nepal’s current economic size, population, and capability to use foreign capital effectively. We may talk about the cooperation between China and Pakistan, with the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) as a flagship BRI program. China indeed has a massive investment in Pakistan. China has good relations with Pakistan for many reasons, one of them being that Pakistani politicians usually do not play the so-called “China card”. Despite political changes in Pakistan, relations between Beijing and Islamabad are seldom harmed. China is equal to every partner within the BRI framework, so the key variable essentially is the local leaders’ political choices and their ability to build consensus in domestic politics.What are you trying to suggest when you say Pakistan does not play China card? Many Chinese International Relations scholars, including me, appreciate Pakistan. What we appreciate about Pakistan is that despite their internal political differences, there is a bottom line that none of them uses China as a card. Because of this, Chinese companies dare to invest in Pakistan. This is good—good for these companies and good for the local guys—and this has created more than 10,000 jobs for the local guys over the past few years. In this way, China and Pakistan have accumulated a high level of strategic trust. Non-intervention has been the fundamental principle of Chinese foreign policy. In most developing countries, the government often changes. The country’s people can change the government if they think it has done no good to the citizens. We only hope that politicians do not use China as weapons when fighting for power. So the goal should be to devise a win-win plan to benefit both sides. You mentioned China’s investment preferences abroad. But don’t you think that the investment decisions of a democratic government and an undemocratic one like China will be different? China is a democratic country. People say that China is not a democratic country since it does not have an election. But the Chinese leaders are under intense pressure to think about history. The Chinese government and the leaders should work for the benefit of all the citizens of the country, not just for their supporters. For example, Donald Trump doesn’t need to serve all American people. Even if he supports the people who supported him during the election, his work is done. However, in China, this is not the case. The Chinese government should reconcile different peoples and encourage joint development of the country. A country like China, which is big both in terms of people and land mass, will split if the government does not tread cautiously. That’s China’s nightmare. We have suffered many tragedies in history, so we don’t want this kind of thing to happen again. The Chinese Communist Party, government and high-ranking leaders believe in history. That is why they try to create or design five-year institutions, projects, and reform plans.For example, the Chinese still celebrate Deng Xiaoping’s legacy. Despite being the leader who was not elected, did Deng use power arbitrarily? No. He prudently used his power to ensure that even 50 years down the lane, the country’s people remember him as a leader who greatly benefitted them. Other Chinese political leaders have also taken responsibility for all Chinese people and have made significant reforms to create an environment for business, and for investment in new technology, such as AI and space technology. How do you assess China’s relationship with South Asian countries in general? We should not indulge in conflict. We need resolution and reconciliation with India in the border conflict. All the neighbouring countries, including Nepal, have no border conflict. Apart from India and Bhutan, China has no border conflict with our neighbouring countries. Bhutan is happy to sign a border contract with China, but maybe they are waiting for the message from New Delhi. China will not exert any pressure. It is reasonable for China to be silent about other countries’ internal affairs. Sometimes, the decisions of neighbouring countries are not suitable for China’s interests, but China often keeps quiet and waits for good things to happen. We don’t have any land ambition in our neighbouring countries; we have enough land. If so, why is there conflict in the South China Sea? We don’t have land ambition, so we don’t want an inch of land from other countries. At the same time, we are determined not to abandon an inch of our land.If you look at the United Nations P-5 countries, which are permanent security council members, China is the most prudent country in which decisions are not made by weapons. In South Asia, China-India relations have again started to improve. It's a good beginning. China's relations with other South Asian countries, including Nepal, are stable. China and India are ancient civilisations. We have enough power to solve our problems together. We don’t need a third party’s long hand. We don’t need this kind of teaching. We are brothers; if we have problems, we can solve them together. The best way to resolve the problem between China and India is to develop mutual political trust, security resolution, and economic cooperation, which I believe will happen. Thanks to the potential threat from Donald Trump’s reelection, the two leaders of China and India have used their political wisdom to make changes in advance and create a better atmosphere for the future. Apart from security, what are China’s other concerns in Nepal?The bottom line in China’s foreign policy with neighbouring countries is peace and stability. If you read the Chinese line, we admire mutual respect. We desire friendly countries to commit to ‘One China’. Second, China would also like to promote economic cooperation with Nepal. Not only with Nepal but also with all countries. We want a simple process of import and export, a good business environment, and transparency in law and policy. If the above-mentioned things are achieved, Chinese companies will dare to increase their investment [in Nepal]. Nepal has long been an adamant supporter of ‘One China policy’. But now it has also committed to uphold ‘One China principle’? What does this shift entail for Nepal?To be precise, there is no difference. China’s bottom line is principle; for our friends, that’s policy. If they accept the One China principle, they will conduct a One China policy, which means they will not develop official contact with Taiwan. Earlier in Nepal, there used to be a discourse that Nepal could be a bridge between India and China, but you have come up with a larger perspective that Nepal could not only be a door to South Asia but also to East Asia. Can you elaborate?We don’t say Nepal or any other country should do this or that. We say we expect something. Frankly, China and India are both robust in population, land mass, and economies. Additionally, India is a young country. China also has its own advantage. Nepal has been blocked geographically by these two countries. But Nepal can potentially be the hub, not limited to the periphery. At least in the next three decades, both China and India can offer the most attractive economic opportunities in the world. If Nepal treads cautiously, it can enjoy the benefit of its location. Geography is constant, but political geography is variable and changes.If China and India go against each other, it might be a nightmare for the Nepali people. But, if China-India come together, even if not like in the 1950s, to make a rational decision not to let the border conflict escalate and promote trade, Nepal can enjoy its location as the intermediary rather than as a bridge. Rather than a bridge, Nepal should be a port. In this way, Nepal can earn a lot with China and India because both countries should get permission from Nepal to use its ports to export and import the goods they want. Bring goods from China’s Tibet Autonomous Region to Nepal and then transit to India. Bring goods from Indian cities to Nepal and transit to China via Tibet Autonomous Region. It is a very short distance, and much better. China is never envious of Nepal and India’s bilateral ties. We will never put sand in the wheels of Kathmandu-New Delhi relations. We know you are friends. But don’t make the friendship exclusive; it should be inclusive.You mentioned that China does not meddle in the internal affairs of other countries. But China has tried to bring communist parties in Nepal together and has been holding ideological discussions with these parties. Isn’t this selective engagement a form of meddling?First, one should know that in China, “international affairs” (among the governments of sovereign countries) are handled by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (中华人民共和国外交部) under the central government, the same as in other countries. At the same time, “inter-party affairs” (between the CPC and all other friendly parties in the world) are handled by the International Department, Central Committee of CPC (中共中央对外联络部) within the Party system.The mission of both the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the International Department of the CPC Central Committee is to promote mutual understanding, friendship and cooperation between the Chinese government, the Communist Party of China and the Chinese people and governments, political parties and peoples of other countries, but the division of labor between the two is slightly different. There are some misreadings and misunderstandings.First, it said that the International Department of the CPC only communicates with communist or left-wing parties. That is wrong. In fact, the International Department speaks on behalf of the Communist Party of China and all political parties around the world that are friendly to China, including both the ruling and opposition parties.Second, it said that the International Department had contacts with opposition parties in other countries. This statement is also wrong. The International Department and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs have their own priorities. The ministry and the government agencies carry out diplomatic activities and naturally deal with the ruling parties of other countries.However, the International Department of the CPC Central Committee conducts exchanges with all political parties that are friendly to China, in line with international norms and practices. Everything is above board and conducive to mutual understanding, mutual trust and win-win cooperation between the two governments, two parties and two peoples.“Non-intervention in internal affairs” (不干涉他国内政) and “foreign affairs are not defined by ideology” (不以意识形态划线) are two major principles of the CPC and the Chinese government.As Sun Yeli, spokesman for the 20th National Congress of the Communist Party of China (CPC) said on October 15, 2022, the CPC maintains different forms of contacts with more than 600 political parties and organisations in more than 170 countries, and the international circle of friends is growing.“The more friends, the better.” As Sun Yeli said, for a long time, and on the basis of the principles of independence, complete equality, mutual respect and non-interference in each other's internal affairs, the Communist Party of China has had extensive exchanges with friendly political parties and political forces of other countries, and its international circle of friends has been growing.In recent years, China has hosted the World Political Party Leaders Summit and high-level Dialogue, attended by more than 500 leaders of political parties and organisations from over 160 countries and more than 10,000 political party representatives. The development of political party relations has driven and promoted the development of state-to-state relations and enhanced the understanding and friendship between the peoples.Sun Yeli said the CPC attaches importance to exchanges with Marxist political parties in other countries. Through theoretical exchanges and policy dialogue, they jointly explore the path of socialist development suitable for their respective national conditions and explore their respective paths to realise the localisation of Marxism.“The CPC's foreign affairs are not defined by ideology,” Sun said, adding that the CPC is willing to make friends with all kinds of political parties of all countries, irrespective of the ideology they uphold, as long as they are friendly to China and willing to conduct exchanges with the CPC.How is China seeing Nepal’s Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli’s Beijing visit, which will commence on December 2? Nepal’s prime minister, especially from the communist parties, often visits China. Big promises and agreements are made during the visits, but they seldom materialise. How hopeful is China about Prime Minister Oli’s visit this time?I am not a foreign ministry official. So I cannot represent the Chinese government. Over the past decade, China-Nepal relations have made remarkable progress. Political mutual trust between the two sides has steadily increased, and economic cooperation has yielded initial results. There is an old saying in China, “haste makes waste.” In other words, whether it is to develop bilateral relations or the economy through economic and trade cooperation, these things must conform to the objective economic conditions and cannot be rushed. Steady improvement and steady progress are the best. \nFormer Indian chief election commissioner SY Quraishi is a strong advocate of credible elections and inclusive democracy. He has extensively spoken and written on how increasing flow of money in elections is taking away the level playing field for candidates from different backgrounds. During his recent visit to Kathmandu, Binod Ghimire of the Post and Suresh Raj Neupane and Rajesh Mishra of Kantipur talked to him on a range of issues from electoral reforms, challenges in maintaining election sanctity in the age of generative artificial intelligence, to why the world is swinging right. Excerpts:Elections and democracy are intertwined. However, recent election results the world over are being seen as a threat to law and democracy. How do you see this phenomenon?Democracy and elections are two sides of the same coin. Without elections, there is no democracy. And worldwide, for the past 10 years, there is a swing towards the right, even in the US. In India, of course, we have been on the right for the past 10 years and our prime minister got a third term, though with a bit of reduced majority.The other thing is that in the past 10-12 years, there has been a debate on whether democracy is on a decline worldwide. The fact is that several indices of democracy indicate the decline. But people’s will cannot be taken as a threat to democracy. Sometimes they go to the left, sometimes, they move to the right. We cannot call it a threat to democracy. The democracy indices which I mentioned have a different classification.First, there are full democracies. Then there are flawed democracies. Third is hybrid democracies. The fourth is an authoritarian regime. So even in South Asia, we have one or two countries which are authoritarian, like Afghanistan and Pakistan. Their ranking keeps going up or down depending on the electoral and democratic performance. In India, the right-wing is ruling, but they lost some majority. They are now depending on two other parties, which are not considered right-wing. Of course, Trump got an absolute majority this time winning both popular vote and electoral votes. He also won both the houses. So, this is what can make him dictatorial. As it is, he is mercurial, and everybody is speculating how he is going to behave. Let’s wait and see.We can agree that people cannot be taken as a threat to democracy. But can we say that the elections, rather than complementing the spirit of democracy, are turning into tools to endorse majoritarianism?Well, people’s will is supreme. If they have chosen absolute governments, if they have given large majorities, you cannot blame the people. Many times a lot of money is being used in elections, and only the rich people get to win elections. In India, for instance, 93 percent of MPs who got elected are crorepatis [multi-millionaires]. Now, law provides for a ceiling on expenditure, so that level playing field is established, where you and I can also contest.But then, the ceiling on expenditure in India has one flaw—it is only for candidates, not political parties. This negates or neutralises the purpose of the ceiling. You can’t spend more than 1 crore, but your party can spend 20 crores on you. So where is the level playing field? Some people say there should be state funding of elections. I oppose the idea but recommend state funding of political parties. It is difficult to monitor election expenditure because of black money. Funding political parties with cheques is what I recommend because it is easy to monitor. So you think election management is more of a problem than the electoral system?Actually, both are important, because obviously the management follows what the system prescribes. There are laws, there are rules, and they have to be followed. For instance, on political funding, there is a cap on expenditure provided by law, and the election management body implements it. Therefore, we have to improve both. Both are equally important. We say public consciousness has increased with time, but there are also concerns that people are picking right-wing leaders. So what is wrong?Actually, it’s a good question but difficult to answer. Why is it that the whole world is turning right? But there are also states like Austria where everybody was thinking the extreme right was winning, but then liberals won. So, there are exceptions. Maybe people want a strong and stable government, which has the benefit of continuity. On the other hand, such a government can be accused of majoritarianism.I heard your prime minister, Oli-ji, mentioning frequent government changes. Obviously, how can the government function with this kind of instability? On the other hand there is the prime minister of India who has been elected for the third term. It is the people's choice, and you can't fault the people. The people chose stability and a strong government, and we have to respect that.Are people not knowledgeable enough to pick the right representatives for themselves?This question is often raised. For instance, we were talking about crorepatis and criminals in politics. Almost 46 percent of MPs in India have criminal cases against them. When we talk to these MPs, they say, look, people are choosing us, so how can you blame us? That way the blame is passed on to the people.Why is the electorate choosing dishonest people against whom there are criminal cases? This debate leads us nowhere. So obviously there is something good these people with criminal background must be doing in the constituency. Maybe they commit crime outside the constituency and like Robin Hood, benefit their own people.Aam Aadmi Party was a new party, and won 67 out of 70 seats in Delhi. They managed funds through crowdfunding and volunteers. And they won hands down.What are the issues that have come up with the proliferation of social media and new media?Social media and new media have revolutionised communication. But, initially, when the election commission of India in 2012 or 2013 came out with some regulation, there was a lot of public criticism, which was unjustified. Social media is also media. So whatever applies to media will apply to social media. And in the election context, what applies to the media? Two things: How much money are you spending on buying space in the newspaper and how much money are you paying to the TV channel?Therefore, how much money are you paying to Facebook or WhatsApp, you have to account for it as well. The law on expenditure will apply to social media also. The second concern was how will the election commission catch the violators, as they are anonymous. The difficulty in catching them cannot be an excuse for not taking cognisance of their offence. If we cannot catch them today, tomorrow we will. How can something be illegal in a newspaper and legal on social media?Rumours always play a big role in elections. Social media has multiplied the problem a thousand times. Within two, three minutes, your country can be burned by false, fake news. Social media however has many benefits. For instance, instead of buying space in the newspaper and TV channel, through WhatsApp or Twitter you can reach your audience in two seconds flat.So social media is a double-edged weapon, as was the consensus in the Kantipur Conclave. And, you know, it is like a knife. Is a knife good or bad? If you want to cut an apple, it is good. If you want to cut a man’s throat, it is bad. It depends how you use it. Now, artificial intelligence has given rise to even deep fakes. But AI has benefits too. Through artificial intelligence, impersonation can be stopped. Voting and logistics can be monitored. But there is so much fraud, deep fakes, and hate. So how do you catch them? That is something we have to be wary about. Frankly, I am worried because its dangers outweigh the benefits. We have to put our heads together globally to make sure artificial intelligence doesn’t overtake human intelligence for destructive ends.In Nepal, both federal and provincial elections happen at once. India too is now mulling ‘one nation, one election’. What is your take on this?There are benefits and there are problems. Logistically, it makes sense. But one MP of Odisha posed this question: ask the people. What do they want? Poor people love frequent elections because this is the only way they can highlight their importance. Otherwise, how many times have we seen that posters are put up in a constituency with headings like ‘Missing’, or ‘Wanted’ [representatives]? Frequent elections make the representatives accountable.We heard you say that if India does ‘one nation, one election’, that will be the presidential election. What do you mean?During parliamentary elections, there are national and international issues. The issues are different in Parliament [national], Vidhan Sabha [state-level] and Panchayat [local]. I would like to say that the local body elections are as important, perhaps more important because they’re closer to the people.India’s prime minister initially said that there would be a national debate and a consensus would be reached. There was a debate for 10 years, but there was no consensus.If there was no consensus, the idea should have been dropped. But the government decided unilaterally that we will go ahead and set up a committee led by the former president of India to suggest ways to implement ‘one nation, one election’. In my articles I have questioned the propriety of a former president being drawn into a government committee.They have made some questionable recommendations. They say that simultaneous will mean Vidhan Sabha and Lok Sabha, not Panchayat. But the terms of reference clearly say that simultaneous means all three tiers. Then it says Panchayat elections can be held after 100 days. After 100 days, there is a separate election. It’s a new election and will require totally different arrangements. These are also not simultaneous elections.  \nNew Zealand all-rounder James Neesham is one of the biggest stars set to feature in the inaugural Nepal Premier League (NPL) T20 cricket tournament, scheduled from November 30 to December 21 at the TU Cricket Ground in Kirtipur, on the outskirts of the Kathmandu Valley.
