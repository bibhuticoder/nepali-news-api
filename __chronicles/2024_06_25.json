Write it in the form of inspiring story not news article or event.\n    \n    Story:\nOnce upon a time, nestled between the towering peaks of the Himalayas and the lush jungles of the Terai, there was a country named Nepal. Though still a developing nation, Nepal was a land of profound beauty and deep-rooted cultural heritage. The residents of Nepal faced many challenges, but beneath these hardships lay a resilient spirit and an unyielding hope for the future.\n\nThis enchanting land, where Mount Everest reaches towards the skies and the air carries a mix of incense and cool mountain breezes, was more than a geographical marvel. It was a mosaic of cultures, languages, and traditions, a testament to human endeavor against all odds. Nepal's history, from the unification under King Prithvi Narayan Shah to its transformation into a federal democratic republic, told a story of aspiration and endurance.\n\nIn recent years, the people of Nepal, with their indomitable will, had taken strides towards rebuilding and reimagining their country. They turned their struggles into stepping stones, each challenge a chapter in their ongoing saga. The shift from a monarchy to a republic had not only changed governance but had woven a new tapestry of democratic values and collective decision-making.\n\nEconomically, while agriculture continued to sustain a large part of its population, Nepal had begun to harness the potential of its picturesque landscapes, developing sustainable tourism that promised to preserve their natural heritage while boosting local economies. Communities living in the shadows of the Himalayas had become stewards of the earth, protecting the biodiversity that made their country unique.\n\nEach day brought new stories. Whether it was a festival in Kathmandu, a technological advance in Pokhara, or a conservation effort in Chitwan, these events were threads in the vibrant quilt of Nepali life. These stories, updated daily, reflected the pulse of progress and the spirit of hope that characterized this resilient nation.\n\nAnd so, as Nepal moved forward, each moment was not just a passage of time but a promise of potential, a narrative of a nation perennially climbing towards tomorrow, guided by the legacy of its past and the dreams of its future.\n\nNews events:\nThe 16th Nepal-China diplomatic meeting focuses on BRI implementation plan signing, bilateral relations, and economic development corridors linking Nepal to Tibet, Sichuan, and Chongqing.\nCooperative victims resumed their protest in Kathmandu, demanding immediate implementation of past agreements and recovery of embezzled funds.\nOver 1,000 Nepalese have contracted various influenza viruses since January, raising concerns about undiagnosed cases and the need for increased surveillance and vaccination efforts.\nNepal's large cardamom traders urge government to negotiate duty reduction with Pakistan and Bangladesh for increased exports and market diversification beyond India.\nClimate change has led to the expansion of dangerous wildlife and diseases into previously unaffected regions, including mountainous areas, demanding an urgent adaptation of healthcare and disaster response systems.\nNepal's new alternative politics, despite promising a break from established norms, have neglected the issue of caste hierarchy and untouchability, failing to address the systemic discrimination faced by Dalits.\nPolarisation has become a widespread phenomenon in the last decade. The electoral victories of Narendra Modi in 2014, Donald Trump in 2016, Jair Bolsonaro in 2019 and the gradually emboldened far-right in Europe clearly suggest a crisis in liberal democracy. This phenomenon permeates global politics, threatening the current world order in the form of tumults, wars, recessions and a multitude of other crises. However, the interesting question is why polarisation benefits only rightists and not others.The United States will elect a new president by the end of this year. However, candidates from both the Democratic and Republican parties are old figures, and there is no excitement or expectation from them. Biden, 82, wants to retain the White House; Trump, 79, hopes to return. Since their policies have dominated US politics for the last decade, it is almost certain what Biden and Trump will do if either of them is reelected. Biden will continue his conventional and centrist policies, and Trump will bring rightist and fascist policies into the mainstream. The significant difference between them is that Trump is a more unpredictable and polarising figure than Biden.There are four major polarising agendas in US politics that benefit Trump. First, Americans have been deeply divided into Pro-Roe v. Wade and anti-Roe camps. Ostensibly, this issue is not that serious since it is merely about abortion rights. Still, its interpretation and implications take it into the core of the left and right political ideologies. Religion/Bible, ethics and individual rights have come to the centre of this debate.Second, US politics has been deeply polarised amid the unprecedented migration crisis. The US is known as a country of migrants. However, floods of refugees from the southern border have become a serious political issue. Biden seems to have failed to address this problem and instead buys the solution offered by Trump, i.e., building the wall on the southern border. Furthermore, whatever solutions he has brought will benefit him in the elections.Third, amid the long income stagnation, the meteoric rise of the wealth of a few individuals has engendered frustration, anger and dissatisfaction among voters. This has also caused disorientation in American society. Despite the Biden administration boasting of creating employment and taking control of inflation, people have felt no qualitative change in their lives. In fact, they blame Biden for not creating equal opportunities in health, education and housing. This widespread disenchantment is going to favour Trump in the upcoming election.Fourth, foreign policy is another crucial polarising factor in the US. Despite China's policy seeming to unite, the Israeli policy has divided the nation. Israel has metamorphosed into a fascist state under US patronage and the premiership of Benjamin Netanyahu, as it is committing genocide against Palestinians. After October 7, when Hamas-affiliated terrorists attacked Israel, there has been continuous bombardment, land invasion and indiscriminate killing of women and children. The US policy to provide military assistance and security guarantees to Israel has divided the US into two camps: pro-Palestine and pro-Israel. This polarisation has hurt the centrist Biden, while one camp of his supporters wants him to stop the war on Gaza. These supporters call themselves “non-committed”. This is also going to benefit Trump in the elections.Another front of this global polarisation is Europe. Far-right political parties have been emboldened. They do not shy away anymore from advocating their anti-migrant, racist and xenophobic agenda. The European Union's recent parliamentary election starkly demonstrates this polarisation. Marine Le Pen's party, National Rally, has become the biggest party representing France in the EU parliament, winning 32 percent of the votes. President Emmanuel Macron has called for a snap election due to the humiliating performance of his Party, Renaissance. However, this decision seems to have given the far-right the much-needed opportunity. Germany is not an exception. The performance of the centrist ruling Social Democratic Party of Germany and its coalition partners was poor, and the far-right Alternative for Germany is taking hold with 16 percent of the votes.India is another interesting case in which political polarisation is seen. Narendra Modi has become Prime Minister for a consecutive third term. His anti-minority, Hindu supremacist and majoritarian politics have not been defeated even after a decade-long experiment. His party, Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), won 240 seats in the recent elections, making it the single largest party in the parliament with 543 seats. As the largest party in the world, the BJP has influenced small South Asian nations toward communal politics. However, Modi's politics caused polarisation in the sub-continent as centrist space collapsed under his iron-fist rule.Polarisation helping the rightEuropean Green parties’ electoral loss is an interesting case of why rightists have exploited the space created by global polarisation. Despite the severe climate crisis, they performed poorly in the European parliamentary elections—all because of their ideological shortcomings. They must confront the widespread problems in Europe, i.e. income stagnation, class hierarchy, immigration crisis and war. Moreover, they cannot indulge in irrational politics by exploiting frustration and anger against the current global system. They cannot act irresponsibly, inhumanly and extra-judicially. They need to bring about ideological clarity or reason to create unity among the left-leaning mass, which is disgruntled by global capitalism. Unfortunately, they have failed to do so. Voters consider their so-called “green agenda” myopic, capitalist and insufficient as they failed to address serious issues. They could not offer any solutions for the migration crisis or the Ukraine war. They have offered no permanent solutions for the climate crisis and class discrimination, making them irrelevant in the eyes of voters. American and Indian left-leaning political parties have also faced the same problem. Left-leaning political parties fail to understand that global polarisation is the result of the crisis of capitalism. Their job to critique it is no longer a need but an option. European Green parties’ agendas, like electric vehicles against fossil fuel use to deal with the climate crisis, are ridiculously insufficient. They need to develop a systemic alternative where poor, wealthy, migrants, native, new and old generations all can find their space. For that, they need to offer an alternative way of life. Without this, their divide will remain intact, and rightist parties will hijack the space.  \nThe issue of jurisdiction that has cropped up in the parliamentary special committee formed to investigate crisis-ridden cooperatives across the country is nothing but a distraction to take the attention away from the main agenda. According to Sishir Khanal, a committee member from the Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP), it is unclear whether a committee formed by the federal Parliament can investigate the cooperatives that come under the jurisdiction of the provincial and local level governments. Khanal and the RSP are clearly fishing for a legal loophole to absolve the party chair and current deputy prime minister and home minister Rabi Lamichhane of the crime of routing money from various cooperatives into the Gorkha Media Network. There is documentary proof of money from at least four cooperatives being pumped into the network at a time Lamichhane was its managing director. Some of these cooperatives fall under the jurisdiction of the provincial governments. Khanal said the committee should work in a way that no legal questions can later be raised over its final recommendations. This is a flawed argument. A bit of context is warranted.The committee was formed after the main opposition, Nepali Congress, disrupted parliamentary proceedings for nearly two months, demanding that Home Minister Lamichhane’s involvement in the cooperative scam, particularly in relation to the Gorkha Media Network, be probed. After long negotiations, it was agreed that a parliamentary committee would indeed be formed and while the committee’s ToR would not mention Lamichhane, it would name the network. The fourth point of the committee’s ToR mentions that it will “study the status of the funds transferred to various organisations, including Gorkha Media Network Pvt Ltd, whether the funds were obtained legally or illegally, and how the funds were put to use will be conducted.” Legal experts the Post talked to were of the view that though many cooperatives may be operating under local or provincial laws, the federal government can regulate them, and as such the probe committee should have no problem in this regard. They point to the country’s constitution which gives the federal government the mandate to regulate all cooperatives.Here, we must again remember that the committee’s ToR mentions that all those entities from which funds have been transferred to the Gorkha Media Network will be probed. No distinction is made between the cooperatives that fall under the jurisdictions of various levels of government. Moreover, the committee had to be formed in order to meet the opposition’s central demand that the involvement of a sitting deputy prime minister and home minister in such an egregious crime be investigated. This is also why the name of the now-defunct media company he was once involved with is mentioned. As the seven-member probe committee has only three months, they should be working full time in determining those responsible for misappropriating hundreds of billions of rupees of common people. As a part of this process, the committee’s task will also be incomplete if it cannot either clear or implicate Lamichhane over the transfer of various cooperatives’ money into the accounts of a private media company. \nAfghanistan reached the semi-finals of the Twenty20 World Cup with a dramatic eight-run victory over Bangladesh under the Duckworth Lewis System in St Vincent on Monday, joining India as the qualifiers from Group 1 and sending Australia home.Bangladesh also had a chance to progress or send Australia through with a victory but the Afghans dismissed them for 105 to take the win they needed to set up a first World Cup semi-final against South Africa in Trinidad on Wednesday.Afghanistan hopes were dented when they were restricted to a modest 115-5 but skipper Rashid Khan took 4-23 and Naveen-ul-Haq 4-26 in a defiant bowling effort that delivered victory.The last few overs were high drama played out well past midnight local time with Bangladesh needing roughly a run a ball and the DLS calculations in case of more rain changing with every wicket and boundary.Naveen delivered the coup de grace in the penultimate over by bowling Taskin Ahmed and trapping Mustafizur Rahman in front off consecutive balls, triggering tearful celebrations from his team mates.India, who beat Australia by 24 runs earlier in St Lucia to leave the qualification hopes of the 2021 champions hanging by a thread, will take on title holders England in the second semi-final in Guyana on Thursday.Rashid won the toss and elected to bat first, sending out the same team that stunned Australia at the same Arnos Vale Ground on Saturday to give themselves a shot at the semis.Openers Rahmanullah Gurbaz and Ibrahim Zadran scored a third century partnership of the tournament to build the foundation for that upset and Bangladesh were desperate to separate them quickly.The Bangladesh bowlers made scoring mighty hard as they combined for 66 dot balls over the innings but they were unable to break the partnership until the 11th over when it was worth 59 runs.Rishad Hossain (3-26) did the damage by having Ibrahim caught on the offside for 18 and the leg spinner returned to remove Gurbaz for 43 as Afghanistan collapsed from 84-1 to 93-5 in 11 balls.Afghan skipper Rashid rallied with three sixes in his 10-ball 19 and was so desperate to score that he hurled his bat down the wicket at his batting partner Karim Janat in fury when refused a second run in the final over.After a brief rain delay, Bangladesh set off at a fair lick as they chased the win in 12.1 overs that they needed to get their run rate up.Left-arm seamer Fazalhaq Farooqi dismissed Tanzid Hasan lbw in the second over and Naveen removed Najmul Hossain Shanto and Shakib Al Hasan in successive balls before another shower swept in with the score at 31-3.Litton Das and Soumya Sarkar bumped the score up to 46-3 by the end of the powerplay but Rashid brought himself on and bowled the latter for 10 from his fourth delivery.Rashid came back on to dismiss Towhid Hridoy (14), captain Najmul Hossain Shanto and Hossain, the latter two in successive balls to reduce Bangladesh to 80-7 just before another shower forced the players off again.Bangladesh’s target was reduced to 114 in 19 overs after the break but their hopes of reaching the semi-finals were now gone, though opener Litton Das stood firm even as his batting partners departed in the late drama to score 54 not out. \nWikiLeaks founder Julian Assange is due to plead guilty this week to violating US espionage law, in a deal that will end his imprisonment in Britain and allow him to return home to Australia, ending a 14-year legal odyssey.Assange, 52, has agreed to plead guilty to a single criminal count of conspiring to obtain and disclose classified US national defence documents, according to filings in the US District Court for the Northern Mariana Islands.He is due to be sentenced to 62 months of time already served at a hearing on the island of Saipan at 9am local time on Wednesday (2300 GMT Tuesday).Assange left Belmarsh prison in the UK on Monday before being bailed by the UK High Court and boarding a flight that afternoon, Wikileaks said in a statement posted on social media platform X.“This is the result of a global campaign that spanned grass-roots organisers, press freedom campaigners, legislators and leaders from across the political spectrum, all the way to the United Nations,” the statement said.A video posted on X by Wikileaks showed Assange dressed in a blue shirt and jeans signing a document before boarding a private jet with the markings of charter firm VistaJet.He will return to Australia after the hearing, the Wikileaks statement added, referring to the hearing in Saipan.“Julian is free!!!!” his wife, Stella Assange, said in a post on X.“Words cannot express our immense gratitude to YOU - yes YOU, who have all mobilised for years and years to make this come true.”The only VistaJet plane that departed Stansted on Monday afternoon was headed to Bangkok, FlightRadar24 data shows. A spokesperson for Assange in Australia declined to comment on his flight plans. VistaJet did not immediately respond to a request for comment.The Australian government, led by Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, has been pressing for Assange’s release but declined to comment on the legal proceedings as they were ongoing.“Prime Minister Albanese has been clear - Mr Assange’s case has dragged on for too long and there is nothing to be gained by his continued incarceration,” a government spokesperson said.A lawyer for Assange did not immediately respond to a request for comment.HISTORIC CHARGESWikiLeaks in 2010 released hundreds of thousands of classified US military documents on Washington’s wars in Afghanistan and Iraq - the largest security breaches of their kind in US military history - along with swaths of diplomatic cables.Assange was indicted during former President Donald Trump’s administration over WikiLeaks’ mass release of secret US documents, which were leaked by Chelsea Manning, a former US military intelligence analyst who was also prosecuted under the Espionage Act.The trove of more than 700,000 documents included diplomatic cables and battlefield accounts such as a 2007 video of a US Apache helicopter firing at suspected insurgents in Iraq, killing a dozen people including two Reuters news staff. That video was released in 2010.The charges against Assange sparked outrage among his many global supporters who have long argued that Assange as the publisher of Wikileaks should not face charges typically used against federal government employees who steal or leak information.Many press freedom advocates have argued that criminally charging Assange represents a threat to free speech.“A plea deal would avert the worst-case scenario for press freedom, but this deal contemplates that Assange will have served five years in prison for activities that journalists engage in every day,” said Jameel Jaffer, executive director of free speech organisation Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University.“It will cast a long shadow over the most important kinds of journalism, not just in this country but around the world.”LONG ODYSSEYAssange was first arrested in Britain in 2010 on a European arrest warrant after Swedish authorities said they wanted to question him over sex-crime allegations that were later dropped. He fled to Ecuador’s embassy, where he remained for seven years, to avoid extradition to Sweden.He was dragged out of the embassy in 2019 and jailed for skipping bail. He has been in London's Belmarsh top security jail ever since, from where he has for almost five years been fighting extradition to the United States.Those five years of confinement are similar to the sentence imposed on Reality Winner, an Air Force veteran and former intelligence contractor, who was sentenced to 63 months after she removed classified materials and mailed them to a news outlet.While in Belmarsh Assange married his partner Stella with whom he had two children while he was holed up in the Ecuadorean embassy. \nBrazil missed a string of chances and were left to rue a lack of quality in the final third after they were held 0-0 by Costa Rica in their Copa America Group D opener in Los Angeles on Monday.Brazil, who came into the Copa America on the back of a run of poor results in recent months, dominated possession but lacked precision in front of goal with just three of their 19 shots on target.“Now it’s about being honest with ourselves, creating alternatives to create chances, scoring, results are important in this competition, points left at the beginning can complicate things at the end,” Brazil defender Marquinhos said.They were frustrated by a resolute five-man Costa Rican defence, who looked to contain their opponents and deprive them of space. The strategy paid dividends even if Gustavo Alfaro’s side rode their luck at times.Raphinha had an excellent early opportunity to score after latching onto a long ball over the top from Rodrygo, but Costa Rica keeper Patrick Sequeira came quickly off his line to snuff out the danger.Brazil thought they had got the breakthrough in the 30th minute when a free kick was flicked on by Rodrygo into the path of Marquinhos, who poked it in at the far post but the goal was disallowed for offside after a lengthy VAR delay.The one-way traffic continued after the break and Lucas Paqueta rattled the woodwork with a long-range effort in the 63rd minute before a venomous Guilherme Arana strike was kept out by a fine save from Sequeira.Coach Dorival Junior brought on youngsters Endrick and Savio in the 70th minute as Brazil desperately sought a winner but Paqueta twice shot wide in the final 10 minutes as the nine-times champions failed to break the deadlock.“We played a great game, we fought until the end, I had three chances myself, we were frustrated not to win, but we left with confidence, we fought,” Paqueta said.“We played our game, we have to improve our finishing, myself in particular and other players, so that we can win.”Brazil’s all-time leading scorer Neymar, who has been sidelined by an anterior cruciate ligament injury, cut a dejected figure as he looked on from the stands.Colombia lead Group D following their 2-1 win over Paraguay earlier on Monday. \nThe weather today will be partly to generally cloudy throughout the country.There are chances of heavy rainfall at one or two places of the Koshi, Madhesh, Bagmati and Gandaki provinces while light to moderate rain with thunder and lightning is likely to occur across the country.Tonight, Koshi, Bagmati, Lumbini and Gandaki provinces will be mostly cloudy while the weather will remain partly to generally cloudy in the rest of the provinces.Stay indoors and keep your umbrellas close as heavy rainfall is likely to continue at one or two places in Koshi, Madhesh, Bagmati and Gandaki provinces. The rest of the country may also experience light to moderate rain with thunder and lightning tonight.On Monday, the maximum temperature of Nepalgunj rose to 40.4 degrees Celsius while Jomsom recorded a minimum temperature of 15.5 degrees Celsius. \nMattia Zaccagni rescued Italy with a 98th-minute equaliser as the defending champions booked their spot in Euro 2024’s last 16 on Monday with a 1-1 draw in a tense game against Croatia, whose tournament hopes are hanging by a thread.Luka Modric gave Croatia a 55th-minute lead, moments after missing a penalty, and that looked like sending them through before late substitute Zaccagni bent a stunning finish past the despairing dive of Dominik Livakovic into the far corner.The result left Italy, who next face Switzerland, second in Group B on four points, with Croatia third and waiting to see whether two points will be enough to take them through to the knockout stage as one of the best four third-placed sides.“We deserved to go through tonight in terms of what we produced out there,” Italy coach Luciano Spalletti said. “It was hard to make it through this group. Spain are brilliant, Croatia are excellent.”Spain, who topped the standings, beat Albania 1-0 to finish with a perfect record from their three games and leave the eliminated Albanians rock bottom with one point.Albania’s loss also propelled sides not in action into the last 16 with England, France and the Netherlands now guaranteed to finish at least among the four best third-placed teams.Italy had been rocked with defeat by Spain, which could have been more emphatic than the 1-0 scoreline, yet if there was some solace for Spalletti’s side heading into Monday’s match it was that Croatia had been even less impressive at the finals.The Croats’ 3-0 loss to Spain and 2-2 draw with Albania had left them on the precipice and one of the main issues that had dogged them at the tournament - how to turn possession into a goal threat - re-emerged in the first half against Italy.Croatia barely gave the Italians a kick for most of the first 20 minutes but it was not surprising that they only had Luka Sucic’s long range pile-driver, which was parried over by Gianluigi Donnarumma, to show for their efforts.Italy looked far more purposeful with Mateo Retegui having a couple of half chances before Alessandro Bastoni had the best opportunity of the first half, meeting Nicolo Barella’s lofted ball to the far post with a header saved by Dominik Livakovic.RELENTLESS NOISECroatia’s fans provided an extraordinary backdrop to the opening 45 minutes with their relentless noise, flares and an ear-piercing firecracker, but it wasn’t until after the break that their team started to repay them for their efforts.The second half was only minutes old when Croatia were awarded a penalty. Andrej Kramaric’s shot struck the outstretched arm of halftime substitute Davide Frattesi and while referee Danny Makkelie waved play-on the VAR sent him to have a look at the screen and he swiftly changed his mind.Modric stepped up to take the spot kick but his effort was saved brilliantly by Donnarumma low to the keeper’s left, although it was only a momentary reprieve for Italy.Seconds later, Croatia’s halftime substitute Ante Budimir’s header drew another superb save from Donnarumma but Modric was on hand to gobble up the rebound, which he fired into the roof of the net to atone for his penalty miss.That made Modric the oldest scorer in the tournament’s history at 38 years and 289 days, but there was to be no lasting celebration for the Croatia captain.Italy pushed hard for a route back into the game and substitute Gianluca Scamacca was inches away from connecting with a cross in the 87th minute.However, with Croatia’s fans starting to celebrate what they thought would be a victory, Italy struck a devastating late blow.“Football was merciless with us tonight, it was cruel,” Modric said. “It is hard when you lose like this to describe how you feel. The football gods don’t always smile on us.” \nMaximilian Araujo, Darwin Nunez and Matias Vina scored as Uruguay beat Panama 3-1 in their Copa America Group C match in Florida on Sunday.Uruguay’s win saw them move level with the United States on three points. The U.S. beat Bolivia 2-0 in the day’s other Group C match.Marcelo Bielsa’s Uruguay, who have won the Copa America a joint record 15 times, were rewarded for their blistering early pace when Araujo fired home a sublime curling effort from the edge of the area in the 16th minute.Panama grew into the match after the break and wasted several chances to get themselves back into the contest.Jose Fajardo blasted an effort wide in the 52nd minute after a defensive error by Mathias Olivera, while Jose Rodriguez tested Uruguay goalkeeper Sergio Rochet with a ferocious shot from range.Asked what he said to his team at halftime, Panama coach Thomas Christiansen told reporters: “I told them they have to be fearless.“That they have to increase their level of confidence. That they are capable to do what they did in the second half. And after the goal, like Uruguay, we generated opportunities.”Uruguay were on the ropes for much of the second half but Nunez, who had already missed a string of chances, settled their nerves in the 85th minute with a coolly-taken volley into the bottom corner after a rebound dropped kindly for him.In a frenetic spell during stoppage time, Vina rose highest to head home Uruguay’s third from a set-piece before Michael Amir Murillo netted a consolation goal for Panama after cutting back onto his left foot and curling his shot past Rochet.Uruguay’s all-time leading scorer Luis Suarez, 37, was an unused sub.Uruguay next face Bolivia in New Jersey on Thursday, while Panama take on the United States in Atlanta. \nThe government on Monday decided to transfer suspended chief secretary Baikuntha Aryal, who has been chargesheeted in a corruption case, to the National Planning Commission.A Cabinet meeting took the decision to create a special position at the commission and transfer Aryal to the post, said Minister for Information and Communication Technology Rekha Sharma, who is also the government’s spokesperson.“Aryal was automatically suspended from his position as per the existing law after the Commission for Investigation of Abuse of Authority (CIAA) filed a case against him at the Special Court,” Sharma said. “For now, it has been decided to create a special position at the National Planning Commission of a hierarchy similar to that of his current position and transfer him there.”According to Sharma, the special position will exist as long as Aryal remains there and it will automatically be dissolved with his exit.The CIAA on Sunday filed a Rs386.7 million corruption case against a company and 11 individuals, including Aryal, at the Special Court over their alleged involvement in irregularities while awarding a contract to print excise duty stickers.In the history of Nepal’s civil service, this is the first time a corruption case has been filed against a sitting chief secretary and subsequently suspended. \nThe Supreme Court on Monday stayed the CPN (Maoist Centre)’s decision to take action against Gandaki provincial assembly member Phanindra Devkota.A single bench of Justice Prakash Man Singh Raut issued an order allowing Devkota to continue working as a lawmaker.“Official documents show that Devkota is associated with the Nepal Samajbadi Party. It does not appear that the petitioner quit the said party, nor does it seem that the petitioner was expelled by the party. The action by the CPN (Maoist Centre), the party with which Devkota is not associated with, is not justified as per the constitutional and legal provisions,” the court said in its order.“An interim order has been issued to the defendants not to implement the action until a final verdict since it appears that irreparable damage will be caused to the petitioner by not being able to perform the role in the capacity of a people’s representative.”Devkota, a minister in Gandaki Province government, was relieved of his position as a member of the provincial assembly on June 14. Speaker Krishna Prasad Dhital removed him as a lawmaker based on the recommendation of the CPN (Maoist Centre), which decided to take action claiming that he had defied the party whip.Devkota, a leader of the Nepal Samajbadi Party who fought the 2022 election under the Maoist Centre’s symbol, had voted in favour of Chief Minister Surendra Raj Pandey of the Nepali Congress. Devkota’s vote was a must for Pandey to win the Assembly’s trust.The Maoist Centre parliamentary party had issued a whip for its members to vote against Pandey. Devkota, however, defied the whip, arguing that the Maoist Centre’s instruction did not apply to him because he comes from a different party.In November 2022 general elections, the Baburam Bhattarai-led Nepal Samajbadi Party had forged an electoral alliance and used the Maoist Centre’s election symbol. \nThe advocates for justice for victims of conflict-related sexual violence (CRSV) have objected to the decision by local governments to start registration of such victims, questioning its legality and assurance of confidentiality.Following directives from the Ministry of Home Affairs, a number of local governments have started collecting applications from the victims of conflict-related sexual violence.The applications have been called from women and girls who faced sexual violence at the hands of state security forces and then Maoist rebels, but whose cases are missing from the state’s records of victims. Since the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) is the authorised body to collect the complaints, advocates for the victims doubt the legitimacy of the applications solicited by the local governments. “What will be the legality of the applications? Will they be recognised by the TRC? As far as I know, the TRC will not accept them,” said Devi Khadka, coordinator of the National Association of Conflict Rape Victims, a network of CRSV victims.The government issued a circular to the local governments to collect the applications with the primary objective of providing relief and compensation to the insurgency-era victims of rape and sexual assault. The state continues to neglect such victims. Neither have they been recognised by the state nor have they received any relief from the government. As many as 63,718 complaints have been registered with the TRC. However, only 314, less than half a percent of the total, are related to rape and sexual violence. Very few victims lodged complaints as they were not convinced that their records would be kept confidential, according to Khadka. “We are not convinced that the local governments can maintain confidentiality. Unlike other victims, they cannot come out on the open because of the social stigma associated,” she said. “Most victims of rape and sexual violence haven’t revealed their ordeals even to their husbands and close family members. Doing so means breaking their families.”If Khadka’s claim is anything to go by, seven insurgency-era victims of rape and sexual violence from a local unit in the Sudurpaschim Province are in trouble as it could not keep their secrets. The representatives at the local level, however, say they are working to support the victims as per the federal government’s circular. “Some 35 victims have applied at our municipality. We are serious about maintaining their confidentiality,” Tilakram Lamsal, mayor at Thakurbaba Municipality in Bardiya, told the Post. He, however, said he was unaware whether the TRC or the federal government will recognise the applications they have collected.Officials at the home ministry also say they are not sure about the legality of the complaints. Radha Kumari Shrestha, an officer with the Peace Promotion Department at the Ministry of Home Affairs, said they got the circular to register the victims for their documentation and to provide relief and reparations. “I am not sure whether the TRC will own up the applications,” she told the Post, adding that respective local governments are responsible for maintaining confidentiality.Through the national budget the federal government has announced plans to create a peace fund of Rs1 billion to provide compensation and financial support to conflict victims. Similarly, different local governments also have allocated budgets to support conflict victims including the CRSV. After months-long discussions, cross-party lawmakers have agreed to allow three months for the registration of the complaints by the victims who missed out on doing so in the past. The victims say the government and parties should prioritise endorsing the amendment bill to the Enforced Disappearances Enquiry, Truth and Reconciliation Commission Act, which will formally open the doors for the TRC to receive the complaints.Laxmi Pokharel, a human rights lawyer with the International Court of Jurists, said the idea of allowing the local governments to keep records of victims is not wrong. However, there are no proper mechanisms at the local units to safely keep the records of the victims of rape and sexual violence. “There is no uniformity among the local governments in providing relief. While some are working actively, several others are doing nothing. This is leading to disparity,” she told the Post. “The federal government should formulate a uniform policy in providing relief, one that will be applicable across the country.”Currently, the Khadka-led organisation has been continuously working to screen the physical and mental health of CRSV victims. A recent medical test conducted among 38 rape victims from the Maoist insurgency showed 11 of them had cancer. Similarly, an additional eight need immediate surgery to remove their uterus. “Further tests are being conducted to ascertain the stage of their cancer. This is very serious,” said Khadka. In the medical tests conducted in December last year, an overwhelming 70 percent of the 127 victims had one or more reproductive health-related complications. The health condition of five of them was bad enough to need regular tests and treatment.  \nThe Nepal-India relationship is complex, wide-ranging and deep, making it difficult to fathom. That is why, despite a long apprenticeship in bilateral relations, I consider myself a novice on the subject. Sometimes, our limited knowledge creates misunderstanding and distrust even if the relationship remains intact. For the past 60 years or so, some people have tried to define the Nepal-India relationship in their own emotional ways but have failed to make any dent without India’s wish. Their concern is understandable when seen from the perspective of broad principles of sovereign equality, territorial integrity and peaceful coexistence, forgetting that inter-state relations are guided more by pragmatism than principles. For any country, national interest is supreme while conducting foreign policies. Most politicians and intellectuals driven by emotions forget that the conditions surrounding them are more deterministic than their feelings. Here comes the question of geo-politics, geo-economics and geo-strategic contexts.The Nepal-India relationship since the Treaty of Sugauli continues to define both limitations of powers and the relationship pattern. Even if some minor adjustments or changes occur, the substance and nature of bilateral relations remain the same. For some Nepalis, symbols matter more than substance, which is vital for conducting bilateral ties. Even then, both countries do not deviate from the main course of the unchanged relationship. India, too, has not departed from conventional policy by trying to operate within the same parameters as the old rulers. Even if the situation and context changed, the basics of the relationship remain the same.India does not like to disturb the structure of the relationship, relating it to its larger national security issue. It seems that even in the future, apart from some minor adjustments, it is unlikely to be drastically altered. Indians think opening the 1950 Treaty is like opening the “pandora’s box” and, hence, needs to be cautiously handled. Without being on the firm ground of reality, Nepalis will experience more woes. Knowing the implications and given the limited strategic autonomy, King Mahendra, apparently a die-hard nationalist, also didn’t raise the issue of the 1950 treaty. Still, policy measures adopted by the royal government and India have led to the erosion of some treaty provisions. Coming close on the heels of the continuity of the relationship, the former foreign secretary and Indian ambassador to Nepal, Shyam Saran, said at a talk programme recently, “There will be more continuity than departure in India’s foreign policy in coming days–in rhetoric and style”. Then what alternative approach can Nepal take? I think focusing on the country’s development, projection of good governance and image by showing the ability to prosper and make people confident should be the strategy. If all-round development takes place by raising people's life standards, national confidence and maturity would grow, eventually leading to better cooperation with the immediate neighbours. The status of a nation is not raised by too much politicisation of relationships, as we have been witnessing for over six decades. Nor is foreign policy conducted through an emotional approach alone. Some developmental activities and formal and informal channels used by both sides to sort out immediate problems arising from time to time can measure how the two countries have stabilised bilateral relations and cooperative endeavours since the 1950s. Regime changes have not at all affected the continuity of the developmental process. Today, the development pace is faster than before. The political environment, irrespective of governments, is favourable, as parties and leaders seem to have understood the significance of development despite their subjective views on various issues. Now, Nepal and India have reached an understanding of purchasing 10000 megawatts of electricity by India and facilitating Nepal’s use of the Indian corridor for power sale to Bangladesh. Since Nepal and India are two separate nations politically and historically, civilisational commonalities do not always work when the question of nation-state arises. Therefore, it is natural that some divergent approaches to events and developments are noticed not to the extent of damaging the structure and dynamics of bilateral relationships. Some issues are perceived differently by the elites of the two countries. For example, some patches of the border often trigger controversy. The two governments have claimed that 97 percent of the border problem will be solved if both sides officially agree. But Nepal is not prepared to agree unless other disputed territories such as Sushta, Kalapanri-Lipulekh and Limpiadhura are settled. Sushta’s problem could have been settled long ago as it is not serious from an Indian security point of view. The Kalapani issue is complex because India considers it settled, but it contrasts with Nepal’s claim that goes far beyond the existing border. Since the newly adopted map called chuche naksa (pointed map) that shows the border up to Limpiadhura has already been passed by the Nepali Parliament by a two-thirds majority after reaching some sort of national consensus, it has become more complex. India reacted to Nepal’s action as a unilateral “cartographic assertion”, adding that the lands claimed by Nepal belong to India. The issue has become more complicated because of the long Indian rule (bhogchalan) and Nepal’s new claim as its territory. In addition to such complex issues, minor problems such as waterlogging in some parts of the Tarai, inundation, floods and trade deficit reduction are nagging. However, the issue of balance of trade entirely lies with Nepal’s capacity to enhance production and make Nepali products market-worthy in India and elsewhere. Only then can Nepal expect India’s cooperation to facilitate Nepali products to enter the Indian market. Mutual trust and confidence on both sides are essential to resolve ensuing differences, big or small. Moreover, perception, rather than reality, gives grounds for distrust. India should not be too suspicious of Nepal’s relations with China and other Western powers, especially the US, as it is armed with leverage over Nepal because, even if it wishes, the latter cannot cross the Rubicon due to various compulsions.   \nThe day I met Rima (name changed), it was already late morning and she was anxious. There were around seven women in a small room. She rocked nervously and reiterated that she did not want to talk. We told her she did not have to. An hour later, we could not stop her from telling her story.Rima’s body was like a battleground in itself. It was 2001: Peace talks between the government and the then rebels had just failed. Nepal Army officials came to Rima’s house and arrested her. She was kept in captivity and repeatedly raped for 14 months by army personnel. She was only 14 at the time. She told her story in minute detail: How her limbs swelled up after being tied up, how the sounds of boots made her heart thump and how the men stomped on her breasts with those boots. She was stoic in her storytelling. Everyone almost forgot to breathe. But what upsets Rima now is not only her past. Like many other women in the world who were sexually abused in conflict, Rima faced social ostracism once the war ended, and twisted versions of social morality and patriarchy won once again. Rima tried to live with dignity. Rima’s quiet storytelling broke into loud sobs when she started talking about her children. Her inability to give them a decent life broke her resolve. Her strength in times of great vulnerability is what breaks my heart. This meeting was in 2021, when we were still in the uncertain stages of shooting our film, Devi. I was with Devi Khadka, our protagonist, a survivor of sexual violence in Nepal’s decade-long conflict. At the time, Devi was still quite unsure about what she could do with other victims like herself, but she wanted to investigate. We had followed her journey and found ourselves in a room of forgotten women: Girls and women who had been sexually abused and raped during Nepal’s conflict. But their existence, while cursorily accepted by the state, had been effectively erased from Nepal’s history.Devi Khadka’s story had haunted me for years. I’d read about her in the newspapers, shocked at some of the commentary, unable to grasp the callousness of it. Khadka was arrested, tortured and raped in custody by Nepal Police personnel in 1997. She was made to tell her story to the press by the Maoist Party after she was released in 1998. A well-known ‘feminist’ columnist wrote a piece in the Nepali Patra weekly in defence of the police, questioning the veracity of the then seventeen-year-old traumatised girl.It took years for Devi to trust the press, and I am humbled that she trusted me to tell her story. It took four more years of telling me her story, listening back to versions of her own story, and analysing it that helped her sharpen her vision. The very act of telling one's story can give the storyteller agency. When Devi first talked to me, she was a district leader of the Maoist party, haunted by the loss of her brother, Rit Bahadur, during the conflict. Like an automaton, she fulfilled the role of a Maoist cadre, telling herself that the party was as loyal to her as she was to the party. But as she met more victims, the change in her was palpable. For those who have not seen this change, it’s easy to dismiss Devi Khadka on so many grounds: Devi can barely understand English, the language of the world of development. She has had only one day of formal education, after all. But she can, in her mother tongue, give an eloquent expression of how wartime sexual violence survivors in Nepal can be addressed. She is doing her undergraduate studies, totally self-taught, and she pours through legal documents and policy papers, catching details that escape many. She can stand on stage, tell her story and move people to action. And she can be sharp. When someone asked her if she can handle budgets as a non-English speaker, she calmly replied, “I’ve managed ministries. Of course I can handle it. If you are asking if I can handle your language, I can always get hired help.” Yet, some from Nepal’s transitional justice community have been unforgiving of Devi, calling her “political” and disingenuous. However, this is hardly a time for pettiness.My job as a filmmaker has allowed me to examine Devi. I’ve seen the trauma that wartime rape has left her with and the struggle she still undergoes to overcome the demons left behind by it. But it is the story of many Rimas, raped by the state forces or violated by the Maoists, and forsaken by both, that has shaken Devi to the core. Once committed, she’s been steadfast. With very little support, she has built a network of survivors, lobbied with the government and other development actors, worked with human rights activists, and has added to the work of many others who have fought for justice to make a tangible impact on Nepal’s transitional justice process. The amended Transitional Justice bill, currently in Parliament, has, for the first time, included wartime sexual violence survivors and opened ways for them to get reparations and justice. Perhaps a better way to understand Devi today is as a human rights activist with political acumen. Storytelling is an act of resistance. It was for Devi but for me as well—a way of expressing solidarity to all the women who have suffered sexual violence during the war (and in peacetime). For every year that Nepal’s transitional justice process remains incomplete, women like Rima will keep suffering while perpetrators remain free. The wounds of the likes of Rima have not healed. For now, Nepal’s wartime rape survivors have some hope with this bill. Devi Khadka, with other survivors, will push on. With the other players in the field who are schooled in the language and the world of development, welcoming Devi as an equal player—not a victim any more, but a leader—will strengthen the cause.Shrestha is a filmmaker and a journalist. Her film ‘Devi’ is screening at the DocEdge Festival in New Zealand in June. \nWith a bit of luck Nepal’s fairytale victory would have been secured.The country’s hopes of progressing to the Super Eight stage of the 2024 ICC Men’s T20 World Cup ended after they lost to cricketing powerhouse South Africa by one run in a nail-biting last-ball thriller in their Group D match at the Arnos Vale Ground in Kingstown, St Vincent on Saturday.But their spirited performance earned praise worldwide after almost pulling off an upset win over one of the tournament favourites.Fielding first after winning the toss, the Rhinos restricted a strong Proteas team to a subpar 115-7 with their stupendous spin attack as Dipendra Singh Airee and part-time bowler Kushal Bhurtel shared all seven wickets that fell between them on a turning track.But they fell agonisingly short from recording their historic first ever victory over an ICC’s full-member nation after they could only manage 114-7.Despite the heartbreak, Nepal’s performance caught attention worldwide.“A performance to be proud of. Keep your heads high,” world cricket governing body International Cricket Council wrote on X, formerly Twitter.South Africa legend Dale Steyn called the Nepal vs South Africa game the “Match of the Tournament” on ICC’s Digital Daily show.“It would’ve been the talk of the tournament if Nepal would’ve gotten over the line. It would’ve been fantastic, and they deserved to win,” Steyn said. “[This was] the match of the tournament to be honest with you. I saw people crying in the stands, it shows how much it means to them, and that’s what cricket is all about.”Indian cricket commentator and journalist Harsha Bhogle said Nepal have a brighter future ahead of them.“Hold your heads high Nepal. That was South Africa you almost took down today. You have some of the most passionate fans and you let them believe. Hopefully bigger days are round the corner.”Indian Premier League franchise cricket team Chennai Super Kings wrote on X: “Unreal fans support! Unreal game of unreal night! Nepal, you have won all our hearts!”“Nepal's performance—all cricketing commentators, most of the IPL franchise teams, cricketing bodies are talking about the team, talking about that fan following!” a Nepal supporter based in Australia wrote on X. “Isn't it great? Didn't we win something?”ICC and Asian Cricket Council commentator Mikkhail Vaswani wrote on his Facebook page: “Nepal are the youngest team in this World Cup. They have put on some great performances. Time to back the boys for a very strong and committed effort.”At an average age of 23.7, Nepal are the youngest team at the World Cup. The team is led by Rohit Paudel, who, at 21, is the youngest captain in the 20-team tournament, while Gulsan Jha, 18, is the youngest player.After the match, Paudel stressed that Nepal needed more exposure against the best teams of the world if they are to be on the right side of the result.“We were very close but a little far,” Paudel said after the close contest. “In crunch moments, we did well, the way we fought was very good.”He added, “If we get more exposure regularly, then next games we will be on the other side [of the result].”Nepal were a far less experienced side as they were making their only second appearance at the world stage.Chasing, the batters took Nepal to 85-2 in the 14th over in the chase, riding on 32 runs from their power play without losing a wicket and a half-century stand between opener Aasif Sheikh and Anil Sah that came off just 36 deliveries.But the introduction of spinner Tabraiz Shamsi (4-19) would prove to be lethal in Nepal’s chase.Shamsi first dismissed Bhurtel for 13 with his only second delivery in the eighth over and Paudel for a duck two balls later to hurl South Africa back in the game.Sheikh and Sah rebuilt the Nepal innings.Sah hit three boundaries off Anrich Nortje and a six off Shamshi to raise the tempo before Sheikh smashed Kagiso Rabada for a four and a six that took Nepal past 80 total after 13 overs with still eight wickets in hand.After Sah fell to Aiden Markram (1-8) making 27 runs off 24 balls, Sheikh and Airee dragged Nepal to 98-3 from 17 overs.But Shamshi returned with the ball in the 18th over and mercilessly raided the stumps of Airee and dangerman Sheikh to turn the game back into South Africa’s favour. Sheikh finished his innings with 42 runs off 49 balls.Nepal needed 16 runs off the last 12 balls but Nortje (1-27) and Ottneil Baartman held their nerves in the final two overs to save the Proteas from the jaws of defeat.Nortje bowled four dots in the penultimate over including a wicket of Kushal Malla that left Nepal requiring 16 runs off the last eight balls.Sompal Kami hit Nortje with a long six and collected two runs off the last ball of the 19th over that brought the equation down to eight off the final six deliveries. Gulsan Jha next cracked a four off Baartman in the 19.3 overs and managed another two off the next delivery to inch Nepal closer to overhauling the target.Nepal only needed two runs off the last two deliveries to keep alive their hopes of reaching the Super Eight but Baartman threw two dots with perfect bouncers to break Nepali hearts.Gulsan Jha tried to take the game to Super Over with a desperate attempt to add a run off a bye of the final delivery but Quinton de Kock and Heinrich Klaasen combined to run him out at the non-striker’s end.Earlier, Bhurtel took 4-19 and Airee bowled 3-21 to trouble South Africa throughout the innings.South Africa added 22 runs for the first wicket before Airee got the breakthrough wicket when he caught and bowled de Kock for 10 in the fourth over.Bhurtel then bowled captain Markram for 15 in the 12th over, ending their 46-run stand for the second wicket.South Africa seemed headed for a good total when they were at 68-2 in the 12th over but Bhurtel’s wrist spin and Airee’s off break kept their powerful opponents under control.Bhurtel removed Klaasen for three before Airee got the big fish Hendricks, who top scored for South Africa with 43 runs off 49 balls, and removed David Miller for seven the next.South Africa needed sixth number batter Tristan Stubbs’s 27 not out off 18 balls for a boost to their innings.Bhurtel then underlined Nepal’s impressive bowling, claiming the wickets of Marco Jansen (1) and Rabada (0) in successive deliveries off the final two balls.Sandeep Lamichhane also started for the first time after missing Nepal’s matches in the United States due to visa issues and bowled splendidly conceding only 18 runs in his four-over spell.“I am very proud of the unit, especially the way we bowled and batted, I'm very proud of that,” Paudel said.South Africa skipper Markram was also full of praise for Nepal’s bowling.“First and foremost, the way [Nepal] bowled it made it really tough for us. They put us under a lot of pressure,” Markram said.The defeat leaves Nepal fourth in the five-team group D with one point, which they earned after rain washed out their second group match against Sri Lanka. Nepal had lost their opening game to the Netherlands by six wickets.South Africa, who had already progressed to the Super Eight round, finished the group stage unbeaten, collecting eight points from four matches.Nepal next face Bangladesh on Monday and will look to end their T20 World Cup campaign on a high note.Bangladesh are second with four points from three matches and a victory over Nepal would secure them a spot in the next round.The Netherlands, on two points, are also in contention and next face Sri Lanka who are also without a win and lie at the bottom of the group. \nThe process of enacting a separate air carriers’ liability and insurance legislation for domestic carriers has stalled yet again.On March 1, the Cabinet approved the tourism ministry’s proposal to prepare a draft bill on domestic air carriers’ liability and insurance.This was done years after Nepal adopted the Montreal Convention of 1999, which makes international airlines liable in case of death or injury to passengers. Nepal adopted the Montreal Convention of 1999 on December 15, 2018.The tourism ministry officials say that the process stalled this time after Buddhi Sagar Lamichhane, the chairman of the panel appointed to prepare the draft bill, was automatically suspended on April 5. This happened after the Commission for Investigation of Abuse of Authority filed a case against 32 individuals, including Lamichhane, at the Special Court over their alleged involvement in corruption in the April 2017 Airbus A330s deal.Mukesh Dangol, an official at the tourism ministry, said the ministry has appointed Indu Ghimire, its joint-secretary, to head the panel. “With this latest development, the process will now move ahead.”He said that after a round of consultation with the stakeholders, the draft will be sent to the finance and law ministries seeking their consent. “Following their nod, the draft will be tabled at the Cabinet before it is registered in Parliament.” The draft, however, is already ready. Officials expect the registration process to be completed in at least two months.The draft of the air carriers’ liability and insurance bill from domestic carriers, which proposes a five-fold increase in compensation for death or injury, has been in the making since Nepal ratified the Montreal Convention.The draft bill was extensively discussed with the stakeholders before it was finalised in 2020.However, successive tourism ministers failed to table the bill in Parliament. The draft bill was then kept on hold without much explanation.The long-delayed air carriers’ liability and insurance draft bill proposes a fivefold increase in compensation for death or injury.As per the planned law, domestic airlines have to pay a minimum compensation of $100,000 for the injury or death of a passenger. Currently, the minimum compensation for passenger death on a domestic flight is $20,000.Under the Montreal Convention of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), carriers have to pay 128,821 Special Drawing Rights (SDRs) or ($171,018) if the damage is due to the carrier’s negligence or a wrongful act or omission.SDRs are an interest-bearing international reserve asset used by the International Monetary Fund.Under the Montreal Convention 1999, in any crash, the victims’ families have the right to claim unlimited compensation if there is a wrongful death.The draft bill says that the carrier should make an advance payment when it is necessary to meet the immediate economic needs of passengers or the families of victims.According to the proposed law, a compensation claim should be filed with the airline or its agents within 60 days of the incident or accident. The carrier’s liability limitation for cargo lost, damaged or delayed shall be $20 per kg if the damage was caused or contributed to by the negligence of the carriers, it says.Under the Montreal Convention 1999, effective as of December 28, 2019, a carrier’s liability limitation for cargo lost, damaged or delayed shall be 22 SDRs per kg ($29.21 per kg) in the case of destruction, loss, damage or delay concerning cargo carriage.Similarly, carriers must pay 1,288 SDRs ($1,709.90) for each passenger in case of baggage destruction, loss, damage, or delay.Likewise, 5,346 SDRs ($7,097.16) should be compensated for each passenger in relation to damage caused by delay in the carriage of persons.The domestic carriers, however, have been objecting to a few clauses, such as the carrier’s liability for delays and unlimited compensation, which, according to them, is not practical in a country like Nepal.Airlines officials say that, given Nepal’s geographical terrain, climatic behaviour, and airport facilities, Nepali airlines cannot afford to be liable for delays.According to tourism ministry officials, the proposed legislation is a modified version of the Montreal Convention 1999 as there are several clauses that domestic airlines would not be able to comply with.Frequent ministerial changes have slowed it down, they say. Some ministers held their positions for long enough but were not bothered about pushing the bill.The bill could not be registered as Parliament was prorogued several times in the past.As a result of the delay, passengers who died in the Yeti Airlines plane crash in January 2023 missed out on compensation in millions of rupees.The Yeti Airlines tragedy in Pokhara was Nepal’s 104th crash and the third biggest in terms of casualties.According to Nepal’s civil aviation body, more than 900 people have died in air crashes in the country since the first disaster was recorded in August 1955.The biggest air accident took place on September 28, 1992, when an Airbus A310 belonging to Pakistan International Airlines slammed into a hillside at Bhattedanda near Kathmandu Valley, killing 167 people on board.Earlier, on July 31, 1992, an Airbus A310 of Thai Airways crashed in Ghyangphedi, killing 113 on board.Nepal’s domestic airlines—nine fixed-wing operators and 12 helicopters—flew 4.15 million passengers in 2023. \nSri Lanka’s rich culture, wealth of natural resources, and diversity of accessible experiences make it one of the world’s best holiday destinations. The most common sight across the island nation is the tank cascades system, an ancient irrigation infrastructure—a network of small tanks draining to large reservoirs that store rainwater and surface runoff for later use. Despite being cash-strapped and plunging into its worst financial crisis in more than seven decades in 2022, Sri Lanka is now bouncing back, thanks to the growing number of tourists. We spent five days in the island country two weeks ago, driving up and down the island, covering almost 70 percent of its territory. Following the trip spanning over 1,000 kilometres, including hills, beach spots, and heritage and religious sites, the Post presents a travel guide to Sri Lanka. \nEducation in Every Home’s report titled ‘Diversity, Equity and Inclusion in Nepal’s Textbooks’ highlights the lack of diversity, inclusivity, and inaccuracies in these textbooks.  The findings include egregious mistakes in textbooks like the inclusion of a letter Abraham Lincloln supposedly wrote—dating to a time 17 years after his assassination, to assertions like Brazil has tigers, elephants and rhinos while Germany has tigers and monkeys. The books display a clear bias in favour of Brahmin Chhetri males, while women make up just 18 percent of all people profiled. While 80 percent of all bylines are male, the presence of marginalised communities, especially Dalits, is nearly non-existent.  \n\nThe Araniko Project, which is also a popular blog, aims to uncover the past and present of the Nepal-China relations by using primary sources in Mandarin. A fluent Mandarin speaker, Rajbhandari, who has lived in Beijing for six years, has a master’s degree in Chinese politics from Renmin University of China.  In this conversation, she talks about Chinese historiography on Nepal, the nuances of Mandarin-to-English translation, Nepal-China ties and the importance of understanding Chinese language in order to understand the country. \nA government panel and agitating Parliament staff on Monday forged a seven-point agreement. With the deal, the agitating staff have ended their protests.The agreement was reached following talks between the representatives of parliament staff and a three-member committee led by Padam Giri, minister for law, justice, and parliamentary affairs.According to the agreement, the government has agreed to raise the rental allowance, educational allowance, and meal expenses for employees working at the Parliament Secretariat.As per the deal, the monthly rental allowances for gazetted officers will be raised by Rs3,500, while non-gazetted staff will receive an increase of Rs3,000.Similarly, an agreement has been reached to raise the monthly education allowance by Rs300 and raise the daily meal expenses provided for overtime duty by Rs100. The amount will be released monthly.The government has committed to gradually fulfilling all of their demands.Starting last week, the Parliament employees refused to work overtime, directly affecting budget deliberations. Despite efforts by the lower house Speaker and the chairperson of the National Assembly, the issue could not be resolved as the government was reluctant to pay the staffers for extra work. They had lobbied with Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal and Finance Minister Barsha Man Pun jointly and individually to release the allowance but to no avail.With no sign of the employees giving up their protest, the government on Sunday had formed a three-member committee led by Minister Giri. \nIt’s been 10 days since Upendra Yadav got reelected Janata Samajbadi Party-Nepal (JSP-Nepal) chair unopposed from the party’s general convention held in Janakpur.Nearly two weeks since the inauguration of the convention and the election of the party chairman, the JSP-Nepal, however, hasn’t elected any other office bearers and central committee members so far.Incumbent chief Yadav was declared the party chair unopposed after no one threw their hat in the ring.After Yadav’s reelection on June 12, the process to elect the office-bearers and central committee members, scheduled for June 13, was halted saying that all other leaders would be chosen in consensus.Before the party decided to halt the election process, 23 candidates—17 men and six women—had filed their candidacies for the five positions of vice chairpersons; six candidates were vying for two posts of general secretary. Twelve aspirants—nine men and three women—filed their candidacies for the three posts of deputy general secretary.Besides, three leaders were in the fray for a treasurer position; and 34 leaders had filed their candidacies for seven positions of secretary.To the question of whether the leaders had deferred the election finding it difficult to pick individuals for available positions, party insiders gave multiple answers.A leader linked the leadership election deferral to the party split in the first week of May.A group of JSP-Nepal leaders split the party and formed the Janata Samajbadi Party under the leadership of Ashok Rai. The Election Commission registered the new outfit on May 6.The JSP-Nepal led by Yadav on May 13 moved the Supreme Court, accusing the commission of recognising its splinter group as a party without the legal basis.Yadav, in his petition, claimed that the commission had registered the party even without the required 40 percent central members on its side. The top court has ordered the relevant authorities to stall the process until the verdict and the case is still sub judice.The uncertainty prevents the newly formed Rai-led party from expediting its activities in a formal way. Seven of the 12 JSP-Nepal lawmakers in the federal parliament and 30 of the 406 party central committee members are with Rai.The new outfit’s plan to build its organisation at the provincial and local levels is in limbo due to the delayed court process. Leaders from the new party claimed that a large number of leaders and cadres are waiting to join the new organisation. Moreover, they are planning to embrace those aspirants of top positions when they are denied posts in central bodies. Observers of Madhesh politics claimed that the JSP-Nepal was unable to complete its election process with the splinter faction eying to lure its members. However, Manish Kumar Suman, one of the aspirants for general secretary in the JSP-Nepal, denied it. He claimed that the stalled general convention process, including the selection of leaders for office bearers positions, would be completed within a week.“As per the election commission deadline, we have to complete the whole general convention process within 35 days,” Suman told the Post. “We will complete the process before the timeframe.”Some political observers say the JSP-Nepal went for the general convention only out of the constitutional compulsion. If the party really wanted to follow the democratic process, it should have allowed the election process to go forward.Article 269 (4) (B) of the constitution mandates the political parties to hold the general convention at least once in five years.“Upendra Yadav has made himself the JSP-Nepal patron,” Shiva Chandra Chaudhary, a Madhesh political observer, told the Post. “He can select leaders loyal to him, having been reelected the party chairman. So he stalled the democratic process.”On the other hand, the new outfit—Janata Samajbadi Party—too has failed to give momentum to the party building process in the six weeks since its inception.The new outfit has gained prominence apparently with the support of the ruling coalition. The Election Commission swiftly registered the new party on May 6 with the name similar to the mother party despite legal ambiguities in the process. The JSP joined the ruling coalition immediately after its formation and supported the Pushpa Kamal Dahal-led government. The Rai-led party has been given a Cabinet minister and a state minister. On Saturday, when the Cabinet made recommendations for ambassadors to eight countries, two nominations went to the new outfit’s supporters. Ambassadors for Saudi Arabia and Spain were appointed in the JSP quotas. Days after the JSP-Nepal withdrew its support to the government, the Rai-led JSP gave its trust vote to Dahal and it supported the government in its policies and programmes.Lawmaker Sushila Shrestha of the JSP tried to downplay the difficulties saying that they were carrying out the party’s activities quietly. “We are engaged in several activities to strengthen the newly formed party, but we are not visible in the media,” Shrestha claimed. “Next Saturday and Sunday, our party’s central committee is meeting.” Shrestha claimed that her party is stronger than the JSP-Nepal in the provinces except for Madhesh. “We have been holding the meetings of provincial committees and are working to make our presence felt in Madhesh Province too.”Though Shrestha claims there are a number of activities within the party, political observers believe that its activities are stagnant due to the case sub judice in the court. “A writ petition in the Supreme Court related to the party split has stalled the new party formation,” Tula Narayan Shah, a political analyst, told the Post.Yadav has claimed the commission registered the party despite its failure to fulfil the required 40 percent support of central members for a party split. JSP-Nepal had 406 central committee members at the time of the party split, but the splinter group only had 30 central members with it.The newly formed JSP was registered amid a legal void as the Political Parties Act 2017 was replaced by an ordinance but not revived afterwards. According to the Act, a group of dissidents can split a party and form a new one if they can prove the support of at least 40 percent of the central committee members and at least 40 percent of the party’s lawmakers.However, this provision was nullified through an ordinance three years ago, leaving no legal basis for a party split. On June 9, the Supreme Court referred the dispute related to the party to the full bench. \nEmployee protests at Parliament Secretariat disrupt budget deliberations due to demands for overtime and odd-hour allowances, stalling progress and threatening timely endorsement of budget bills.\nThe news of former President Bidya Devi Bhandari renewing her party membership has become a matter of discussion in Parliament. The ninth general convention of CPN-UML held in Kathmandu in 2014 had elected Bhandari a vice-chair of the party. After Bhandari was elected the country’s President in 2015, she gave up the party membership as mandated by the constitution. She secured the second term in the presidential election following the 2017 parliamentary polls. After Ramchandra Paudel replaced her as the head of state last year, Bhandari has been relieved of duties and has been enjoying state facilities as a former President. Parliamentarians have started asking: Can a former head of state who has been enjoying state perks return to active politics? They have also demanded that the government look into the services provided to the former head of state. Speaking in the House of Representatives on Wednesday, Nepali Congress lawmaker Ramhari Khatiwada, who chairs the State Affairs and Good Governance Committee, said the government should clarify whether former President Bhandari qualifies for state benefits after renewing her UML membership. Media reports suggest the former President renewed her membership in a political party, Khatiwada said. “After the party membership renewal, can she still enjoy state benefits?” he questioned. “What is the state’s take on this?”He also demanded the government inform Parliament about the arrangements made for the former President.The Constitution of Nepal is silent on whether a former head of state can engage in active politics after leaving office.However, this is a question of constitutional ethics, says Raman Shrestha, a former attorney general.“If we look at the examples of other countries, a former head of state does not return to active politics, let alone by reclaiming the membership of a party,” Shrestha told the Post. “It is a question of ethics.” CPN (Maoist Centre) leader Pampha Bhusal said the question of morality only applies to the one who sticks to it. “If we see the history of Nepal, we find that a person who has become the prime minister has become an ambassador and taken other responsibilities,” Bhusal told the Post. “It is a personal decision whether to rejoin active politics after serving as the head of state. Let’s not make too big a fuss about this.”However, political observers and analysts say that when a person who has been receiving state benefits for their former role returns to active politics, it raises serious questions about that person and the party that gives the membership. Nepal has yet to formulate policies on the perks and benefits to be provided to a former head of state. The current practice is for the Cabinet to decide on such perks, according to an officer at the home ministry. “The former President gets a monthly stipend of Rs50,000. Another Rs200,000 is provided in monthly house rent,” said the officer. “If the former President has a house of their own in Kathmandu and decides to stay there, they get Rs100,000 a month in maintenance expenses.” They also get security personnel. However, the ministry officer refused to disclose the ‘sensitive’ security details. Ram Baran Yadav, the first President of Nepal, claims funds for housing from the government whereas Bhandari lives in her own house. Even before retiring from presidential duties, Bhandari had decided that she would go back to her own house, fuelling speculations about her plan to return to active politics. Bhandari is the widow of the late communist leader Madan Bhandari, who provided the ideological line to the UML. Most of Nepal’s major communist forces, the Maoist Centre led by Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal and the CPN (Unified Socialist) led by Madhav Kumar Nepal acknowledge the role of Madan Bhandari in advancing the communist cause in the country.UML Chairman KP Sharma Oli, Nepal and Dahal have once been together in a single political party after the 2017 elections. Whenever the communist forces form a coalition, as the three parties are doing now, the issue of their strategic partnership comes up.The Nepal Communist Party (NCP), as the unified force was called, saw a split when Dahal and Oli jointly chaired it but Oli is often criticised for being chiefly responsible for the unified party’s failure given his leadership style. Now when the three forces are rumoured to be planning to contest the 2027 elections on the same side, the chances of former President Bhandari returning to politics to potentially unite the parties as a leader acceptable to all are said to be high.Bhandari reportedly renewed party membership on the Nepali New Year day, more than two months ago. Madhav Dhungel, the secretary of the central organisation department of the UML, took to social media on June 18 to clarify the issue. “There is no doubt that Bhandari became President as a UML leader. But then she had to distance herself from the party, and she did so,” reads the facebook status of Dhungel. “However, she has the right to provide guardianship to the whole country, the Nepali people and the political party that she nurtured.”“Whether to return to active politics is a personal matter. If she [Bhandari] does so, she won’t do so on the sly,” Dhungel writes. “If she desires to be active in politics, she will undoubtedly do so in the UML.”On the question of Bhandari renewing her party membership, Kashinath Adhikari, the head of the party’s central organisation department, said he was not in a position to give a definite answer. “Membership in our party is renewed at the start of the [Nepali] new year,” Adhikari told the Post. “Who all have renewed party membership will be known only after going through the final list of those doing so in the given time.”  \nPrime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal on Thursday expressed his deep frustration over the low attendance of lawmakers and senior party leaders during his question and answer session in the House of Representatives.While low attendance in the House is not uncommon, as per the tradition, almost all lawmakers and senior leaders, except those with urgent commitments, are present when the prime minister speaks in the House or organises a question-answer session on contemporary issues.“The absence does not undermine the post of prime minister, it undermines the lawmakers themselves,” said Prime Minister Dahal, who was visibly distressed. Among those notably absent were top leaders including Nepali Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba, CPN-UML Chairman KP Oli and CPN (Unified Socialist) chief Madhav Nepal, as well as several Cabinet ministers and dozens of lawmakers from ruling and opposition benches. Out of 22, only eight ministers were present. A Nepali Congress leader said that Congress President Deuba was briefly present in the House, but had to leave due to health issues. But other senior Congress leaders and office bearers were notably absent. Similarly, CPN-UML chair Oli visited Parliament but did not enter the House. He left Parliament premises before the prime minister started speaking. Oli attended another function in the Capital.Several Cabinet ministers including two deputy prime ministers Raghubir Mahaseth and Narayan Kaji Shrestha were also absent when Dahal was responding to lawmakers’ queries. “There has been a tradition in Parliament that leaders of both opposition and ruling parties should be present when the prime minister speaks. The absence does not undermine the prime minister but rather the parliamentarians themselves. Except in emergencies, leaders of ruling and opposition parties, ministers and lawmakers traditionally attend the meeting where the prime minister speaks. But this tradition is being watered down, day by day. This definitely does not undermine the prime minister’s position,” said Dahal.The visibly upset prime minister said before concluding his statement by warning that “if such a trend continues, it is a gross insult to all of us.”Before making this statement, the prime minister answered questions from eleven lawmakers on various issues. He also discussed his recent visit to India and President Ramchandra Paudel’s visits to Switzerland and Germany.Prime Minister Dahal, earlier this month, attended the swearing-in ceremony of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi in New Delhi. He also held talks with Indian President Droupadi Murmu, Prime Minister Modi, and External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar, among other top officials.During his meetings with Modi and Jaishanker, Dahal said, issues related to strengthening bilateral ties, activating bilateral mechanisms between Nepal and India, and increasing Indian investment in Nepal, among others, were discussed.While speaking in the House, the prime minister expressed his dissatisfaction with budgetary allocations stating the ministers did not follow his directives.“Ministers should take the prime minister’s directive seriously while selecting projects and programmes,” said Dahal. “Despite my directives, small and micro projects are still being included in the budget. You will be ministers and prime ministers tomorrow, so we need to correct these practices.”“Despite tall promises, this fiscal year’s budget has several small and micro level projects below Rs30 million. The government had earlier promised to entrust projects and programmes under Rs30 million to provincial governments. I am not fully satisfied with the budget and its provisions.”While responding to lawmakers’ queries, the prime minister said that those responsible for the Tikapur massacre would be punished. As many as eight people, including a toddler and seven policemen, were killed by protesters on August 24, 2015 in the run up to the promulgation of the constitution. Dahal also assured that the government is committed to ensuring the identity and social and economic empowerment of the Tharus and other socially and economically marginalised communities.The prime minister also informed Parliament that Nepal and India are seriously considering two dedicated religious corridors—the Ramayana and Buddha circuits—to promote religious tourism.“We have ensured the budget for developing Ramayana, Shiva, Buddha, and Kirat circuits,” said the prime minister. “Fifteen different religious sites between Nepal and India will be connected under the Ramayana and Buddha circuits.” Nepal and India have already reached agreements and understandings on developing these circuits.Similarly, the prime minister stated that the government is committed to making ambassadorial appointments more orderly, dignified, transparent, and performance-based. He also defended the government’s recent decision to recall Nepal’s ambassadors from several countries, stating that the decision was in line with the constitution.The recent decision to recall envoys from 11 nations created quite an uproar in various quarters.“The government is committed to using diplomatic missions and envoys in the best interest of the nation,” he said. “As per the Ambassador Appointment Directive, 2015, the envoys can be recalled before completing their terms, if necessary.”“Typically, only those appointed under political quota are recalled immediately after a change in coalition,” the prime minister said. “But this time, the envoys remained in their posts for more than three months after a change in the ruling coalition.”Dahal said this was proof of how the government was serious about the issue.Government picks some ambassadors under political quota based on recommendations from coalition partners while it selects some career diplomats from within the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.Talking about his recent India visit, Prime Minister Dahal also said that there were discussions on effective implementation of the agreements reached between the two South Asian neighbours.According to Dahal, among the issues discussed during a meeting with his Indian counterpart, Narendra Modi, were strengthening Nepal-India relations, implementation of past agreements, and bilateral discussions—including border disputes. “There were serious discussions on the implementation of the Pancheshwar Multipurpose Project, Arun Hydropower Project and cooperation in the agricultural sector,” Dahal said.Likewise, the prime minister stated that the government has initiated the formation of a high-level committee to address the challenges being faced by cooperatives.After the committee’s input and suggestions, crisis-ridden cooperatives will be identified and action initiated to return deposits and manage their assets.Dahal said that more than Rs772.44 million has already been refunded to the victims of cooperatives.Addressing the meeting, Dahal stated that 59,587 individuals, affected by cooperatives, had filed complaints alleging embezzlement of deposits totalling Rs36.28 billion. Of this, the government has so far paid back Rs 772.44 million.The prime minister added that the government had declared 20 different cooperatives as ‘crisis-ridden’ and that the process of refunding affected depositors was being facilitated through the Crisis-ridden Cooperative Management Committee.Dahal also mentioned that efforts are underway for a separate legal procedure to establish an independent regulatory body to protect cooperative savings.“The government is aware of the problems faced by cooperatives and is serious about addressing them. Various efforts have been made to implement the suggestions of the high-level task force and agreements reached with the cooperative victims under the coordination of the National Planning Commission last year,” he said.Prime Minister Dahal said that a committee had also been formed at the provincial and local levels to solve the problems of those affected by cooperatives.A law to establish an authority to regulate and supervise large-scale cooperatives is also being drafted, Dahal said. “Not all cooperatives are in trouble. Many have helped lift people’s livelihoods while operating based on established international practices and as per the law,” Dahal said.He added that despite the significant increase in the number of cooperatives, there were plenty of shortcomings in their qualitative improvement. \nWith the general convention of the CPN (Unified Socialist) approaching closer, top leaders of the party have intensified their preparations and lobbying for the top posts.As they expedite their lobbying through various informal channels, the party leaders in their formal speeches are emphasising the need of electing the leadership through a consensus.Senior leader Jhalanath Khanal did the same on Monday.A group of CPN-UML leaders led by Madhav Kumar Nepal, the party’s former chief, split the country’s largest communist party to form the CPN (Unified Socialist) in August 2021. They split the party protesting against UML chair KP Sharma Oli’s decision to dissolve the House of Representatives twice.Following a poor performance in the 2022 elections, where it failed even to secure the status of the national party, the CPN (Unified Socialist) is now struggling to retain party members. Despite holding important portfolios in the federal and provincial governments, the party leaders are finding it difficult even to stop its members from rejoining their old party, the UML, let alone attracting new members.Amid the diminishing influence, the party is gearing up for the general convention scheduled for June 30 to July 4 in Kathmandu.If the claims recently made by the leaders are anything to go by, the two former prime ministers—Nepal and Khanal—will face each other for the position of party chief during the general convention. Both of the leaders also led the CPN-UML in the past.Khanal on Monday emphasised the need of electing the party leadership through a consensus.While addressing the event to launch ‘Mahila Sankalpa-2’, which is the mouthpiece of the party’s women’s wing, All Nepal Women’s Association, Khanal stressed the need for a consensual election of the leaders. However, a certain criteria of leadership should be followed, Khanal said.“To strengthen the leadership within the party, we must select the leaders of the party through a consensus,” Khanal said during the programme. “Since our party was formed on the basis of an ideological ground, political direction, and certain policies and principles, we all should strive to maintain these values while selecting the leadership as well.”A party insider claimed that Khanal staked his claim for the top position as his political line was adopted in the political document to be presented in the general convention. Party general secretary Ghanashyam Bhusal prepared the political document to be presented in the general convention of the party. While in the UML, party chair Nepal embraced Madan Bhandari’s People’s Multi-party Democracy unconditionally for many years while Khanal and Bhusal viewed it critically. According to party leaders, Khanal and Bhusal have succeeded in including their ideas in the Unified Socialist’s official line.“In politics, the leaders whose policies prevail as the party’s official line should get the opportunity to lead the party,” a party leader told the Post on the condition of anonymity. “Though the political document of the party is guided by the thoughts of general secretary Bhusal, Khanal also owns it, so he is claiming the leadership.”This does not mean that party chair Nepal has not owned the political document passed by the party's central committee, but the document is closer to the political line advocated by Bhusal and Khanal for a long time, said a party insider.Party chair Nepal, while addressing the same programme on Monday, also said that there are no differences among the leaders in terms of the party’s ideological line. “The preparation of the political, organisational and other documents to be presented in the upcoming congress is a collective effort of party leaders and cadres,” Nepal said.In addition to Nepal and Khanal, the party's general secretary Bhusal is also considering contesting for the party chair in the upcoming congress, though he has not publicly announced it yet.“Matters related to the aspiration of the leaders for the post of office bearers will be clear only after the selection of convention representatives,” Jeevan Ram Shrestha, the secretary of the party, told the Post. “Before the selection of the representatives, all things that have come from the media are mere speculation.”The party has decided to select general convention representatives from around the country on Wednesday. Shrestha said that the selection of representatives will make things clearer about the aspirants’ claims.Khanal has already opened his contact office at Baneshwar with a plan to manage his team’s activities during the general convention.Though Khanal has opened his contact office, he may or may not contest for the vital post, says another leader of the party who does not want to disclose his identity. The leader said that it might be under his publicity strategy. “If the political scenario is not in his favour, Khanal might back Bhusal for the leadership of the party to challenge Nepal,” the leader claimed. “On the other hand, Nepal, the present chair of the party, might also back Bhusal if he senses a tough challenge from Khanal.”Bhusal has remained tightlipped about his candidacy in view of the situation, a leader close to Bhusal said. “If the two top leaders decide to face each other, Bhusal might settle with his current position of general secretary.”The party’s deputy general secretaries, Jagan Nath Khatiwada and Parkash Jwala, have already announced their bid for the post of general secretary.The party will most likely select the leadership through consensus, says another leader. Meanwhile, there are voices in favour of continuing present chair Nepal in the position saying that he has put utmost efforts to establish the party after the split and sustain it amid a challenging situation. But there are also leaders who want Khanal’s leadership.“One of the two leaders will possibly lead the party,” Unified Socialist leader Som Prasad Pandey, who is close to Nepal, told the Post. “Though Bhusal’s name is also in the discussion for the post of chair, he is most likely to continue as the general secretary.”Meanwhile, former CPN-UML vice-chair Bhim Rawal, who has remained inactive in the UML after the party's convention held in November 2021 in Chitwan, is reportedly considering joining the Unified Socialist from the upcoming congress. In 2021, Rawal challenged Oli for the position of party chair despite Oli’s request not to do so. Since then, Rawal has been given no role in the UML.“Our party is in talks with Bhim Rawal to bring him to the party. We have already held two rounds of negotiation with him,” Shrestha, the secretary, told the Post. “If everything goes as planned, Rawal will join our party with a respectable position.”The Post’s attempts to contact Rawal to confirm Shrestha’s claim were unsuccessful. \nA police officer was found dead on the premises of the federal parliament building in Baneshwar, Kathmandu on Wednesday.According to Ekram Giri, spokesperson for the federal parliament secretariat, Ajit Gole of Dolakha committed suicide by shooting himself.The body of the victim was recovered from the parliament building’s washroom.Dinesh Mainali, spokesperson for the Kathmandu Metro Police Range, said Gole, who was on duty from 6am to 10am, was found dead at around 8 in the morning. “A constable of Nepal Police was found dead inside a toilet of the parliament building,” Mainali told the Post. “Preliminary investigation shows he was inflicted with a gunshot.”Nepal police said the investigation is underway. \nPolice on Friday arrested two people from Thimi of Bhaktapur for allegedly mining cryptocurrency.The Central Investigation Bureau took 50-year-old Biswas Gurung and Rajendra Tahamata, 25, into custody in connection with the crime, said Hobindra Bogati, spokesperson for the bureau.The duo allegedly ran mining operations from the CTEVT’s information technology lab using a server and 64 desktops, on which blockchain applications were found during a preliminary investigation. Further investigation into the matter is underway. \nThe Central Investigation Bureau has arrested three individuals on charges of embezzlement of over Rs74 million of the Kathmandu-based Square Savings and Credit Cooperative.Those arrested include cooperative chair Basudev Man Joshi, 66, of Kathmandu Metropolitan City-14; secretary Subarna Selalik, 67, of Kathmandu-25; and member Dharma Ratna Pachhai, 58, of Kathmandu-26.Superintendent of Police Hobindra Bogati, who is also the spokesperson for the CIB, said they were arrested on Friday. On Sunday, Kathmandu District Court remanded them for a week for further investigation.According to him, the cooperative operators have been accused of luring depositors with the promise of attractive interest rates but failing to return their deposits. \nDays after Kathmandu Mayor Balendra Shah joined the Nepali Congress in accusing CPN-UML chair KP Sharma Oli in a multi-billion-rupee failed land swap bid in Jhapa, lawmakers from the main opposition have backed Shah in his initiative to expand the sidewalks at New Road—something the UML opposes.Speaking in the House of Representatives on Thursday, Congress General Secretary Bishwo Prakash Sharma backed the mayor's plan to expand pedestrian lanes at New Road that clashed with the vision of the Road Division, led by a UML minister, to widen the roads instead. Lawmaker Sharma said that in case of conflict between a central agency and a local unit, the federal government should show more restraint than the local government.“Mayor Balendra Shah’s initiative to widen pavements at New Road is the right step for the general public’s convenience,” Sharma told the House. “Mayor Shah should be allowed to continue his work without any interference as what he is doing is absolutely right.”The conflict escalated when the Road Division, under the federal government, intervened and paved the road cut by the metropolis on Monday. The metropolis had cleared stretches a few metres wide on either side of the road to create space for pavements. The dispute resulted in a standoff between those deployed by the Road Division and the Kathmandu municipal staff, with different people taking different sides. The tension eased without any untoward incident as the metropolis backed off after the federal government deployed police at the site.The Road Division, under the Ministry of Physical Infrastructure and Transport, is led by Deputy Prime Minister Raghubir Mahaseth, who is a UML secretary. The dispute grew to involve those supporting Mayor Shah and the UML, the biggest partner in the Pushpa Kamal Dahal-led coalition, and also spilled over to social media.In Parliament, lawmakers from the main opposition Nepali Congress threw their weight behind Shah.Not only the party’s general secretary Sharma, two other lawmakers from the party also expressed their support for the mayor in the House meeting on Thursday. Congress lawmaker Arjun Narsingh KC said the conflict between the federal government and the Kathmandu mayor has raised serious questions about the federal government’s intent. KC stressed that cooperation and collaboration between the federal, provincial, and local governments is essential in avoiding conflict and resolving disputes between the three federal units. He said Articles 232 and 235 of the constitution and related schedules clearly define their jurisdictions.“The recent conflict between the federal and local governments and the saga of making and breaking of a road section have raised serious questions,” KC said. He urged the government not to resort to violence and to resolve the issue in a rational way.Another Congress lawmaker, Kanti Sejuwal, also speaking in the zero hour of Parliament, questioned the government for clashing with the municipal authority. “Either we should scrap the Local Government Operation Act 2017, or the federal government should let Balendra work.”As the Road Division intervened in Mayor Shah’s plan to widen the pavement in the New Road area, Sejuwal had expressed his anger at UML chair Oli.Following the federal agency’s intervention, the mayor wrote on social media, alleging Oli’s involvement in the attempted illegal swapping of land at the Birtamode-based Giri Bandhu Tea Estate worth billions of rupees. The largest party, the Congress, had been accusing the UML chief of being complicit in the land swap issue.A few days ago, Shah also engaged in a heated exchange with the KMC’s Ward 22 chairman Chinkaji Maharjan, a UML member, over the sidewalk expansion. Even before that, municipal staff dumped a truckload of dirt and trash outside the Kathmandu Road Division office, claiming that the delayed road expansion work from Kalanki to Maharajgunj had inconvenienced the public.Earlier, on May 14, the Congress parliamentary party meeting had decided to raise the issue of the tea estate land in Parliament. The Oli government, formed after the 2017 general elections, allowed the owners of the tea estate to swap 343.19 bighas (232.43 hectares) of land it occupied, based on a revision to the Land Act (1964). The Act was revised in January 2020, under the Oli administration, introducing a provision for allowing a swap or selling of land to pay off the tea estate’s liabilities if it went into liquidation. Asked if the Congress had backed the mayor as he alleged the UML chair Oli’s involvement in the Tea Estate land scam, the Congress publicity department head Min Bahadur Bishwokarma denied it. “Party lawmakers including the general secretary must have backed the mayor as the New Road sidewalk issue is of public concern, and not necessarily because it involves the UML,” Bishwokarma said. \nDead bodies of a man and a woman were found on a cliff in Dakshinkali Municipality-8, located on the southern outskirts of Kathmandu.According to the Kathmandu Valley Police Office, the bodies were spotted approximately 200 metres down the hill from the Kathmandu-Dakshinkali road.Senior Superintendent of Police Dinesh Raj Mainali said that the preliminary investigation suggests they died in an accident, as a crashed motorcycle was found near the bodies.Mainali said a disaster management team of Nepal Police is working to retrieve the bodies from the hill. He said locals informed the police after spotting the bodies on Wednesday evening.The police said the deceased woman is a 32-year-old resident of Changunarayan Municipality-5, while the man is yet to be identified. \nPrivate dairies have requested subsidised loans from the government to settle farmers' dues, amounting to nearly Rs3 billion, amid the ongoing dairy sector slump.They have also requested the government to permit them to export dairy products such as powdered milk, butter, and cheese, as consumption within the country has remained subdued. As a result, the stock has been piling up. Recently, the government partially bailed out the state-owned Dairy Development Corporation by providing Rs300 million in soft loans. After dairy farmers started protests, officials privy to the matter told the Post that the government is preparing to release another Rs600 million to the corporation. The corporation had in February said that the dairy industry was suffering from a recession and hoped that sales would increase in summer. But it didn’t.Both state-owned and private dairy companies said that the ongoing economic slowdown has dampened dairy demand, resulting in stopped cash flow and rising liabilities to farmers as products remained unsold for months.“We are unable to pay farmers due to unsold products. The stock, too, is huge,” said Prahlad Dahal, president of the Nepal Dairy Association.“So we have requested the Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock Development to provide a soft loan keeping our dairy products as collateral. We have also requested the government to open up exports so that we can sell our products and become able to pay the farmers.” The association is scheduled to meet the agriculture minister on Monday. “We hope that our request will be heeded,” said Dahal. The association has requested a soft loan for more than 50 percent of its remaining stock. Private dairies have stocks of powdered milk and butter worth Rs5 billion, said Dahal.According to the association, the committee formed by the agriculture ministry to study the payment issues of dairy farmers found that around Rs4.50 billion is due to be paid by dairies to the farmers. The amount was previously Rs7 billion.This shows that payment is being made gradually, Dahal said. “But that is not sufficient.”Consumer demand for milk and other dairy-related products declined last year, with the government hiking the price of raw milk to benefit and encourage more dairy farmers to join the sector. However, the unscientific hike hit demand amid the people's declining incomes due to the economic slowdown.Regarding price reduction to increase consumption, Dahal said private diaries have a high cost of production, so it will not be possible to reduce the price.The government also imposes VAT on dairy products like ghee, ice cream, and cheese. “If the VAT is waived, prices will come down, which can boost the sales,” said Dahal.According to the association, nearly 1 million litres of milk comes from the formal sector, which implies a daily transaction of Rs70 million.“If the soft loan is provided and export is permitted, we will be able to clear all the farmers' dues by September,” Dahal said.Dairy entrepreneurs said that the butter stock is gradually being cleared, and milk production has declined, balancing stock and output.Last Wednesday, dairy farmers demonstrated outside the Lainchaur-based Dairy Development Corporation, demanding immediate settlement of their outstanding payments. Police arrested dozens of dairy farmers during the protest.Around 50 farmers were arrested as they attempted to picket the corporation. According to the association, 600,000 families are associated with the dairy sector, contributing 45,000 jobs. More than Rs60 million cash flows from urban to rural areas daily, and the government collects revenue of more than Rs2 billion monthly.“The agriculture ministry has called us for a meeting on Monday,” said Amar Bahadur Kunwar, president of the Central Dairy Cooperatives Association. “Both private and government dairy industries have more than Rs5 billion in dues to be paid to dairy farmers.”Dahal said the state-owned corporation alone has outstanding dues of Rs2 billion to the dairy farmers.The corporation even issued a public notice on June 10 inviting bids to sell its butter and powdered milk. As per the notice, it planned to sell 200 tonnes of butter (15kg block) and 300 tonnes of skimmed powdered milk (25kg bag).In another notice on Sunday, the corporation fixed the skimmed powdered milk rates. The country currently produces more than 6 million litres of milk daily. The corporation purchases around 25 percent of it. \nIn Nepal, the festivals measure the economy. Last Dashain, the cash crunch forced consumers to trim purchases.After a year, the situation seems unimproved.“We are not in the mood to place orders for goods for upcoming festivities,” said Ram Hari Karki, president of Nepal Trans Himalayan Border Commerce Association. “There is no demand at all. It looks like a deep economic slowdown.”Usually, traders place orders for foreign goods, particularly apparel, three months before the start of Nepal’s key festival season. Even though traders bring some amount of goods, it may be costlier. Due to the appreciation of the US dollar and increased customs duties, the prices of goods and commodities may rise, causing difficulties for many ordinary Nepalis.“Goods are becoming costlier day by day. That is why traders are cautious this year about placing orders,” said Karki. “The demand for festivities has not returned to the pre-pandemic level.”There are no statistics about consumption during the Dashain, Tihar, and Chhath festivals, but analysts say it grows manifold compared to the normal time. Kumar Karki, president of the Nepal National Traders’ Federation, said due to subdued demand, they may see a business decline by 15–20 percent. In comparison, prices may rise by 20 percent in the upcoming festivals.Even during the summer, traders say the market has slowed down.“Despite the rising heat, the demand for summer garments and shoes has not picked up,” said a trader in New Road, the country’s central shopping hub. “The footfall of shoppers has declined compared to last year’s season, reflecting the decline in people’s incomes.”“Nowadays, only a handful of traders are planning their trip to China to order goods. We don’t see demand recovering from last year’s drop,” said Kumar Karki.Some traders say there is a shift in the trade.In the past years, China fulfilled 80 percent of Nepal’s need for readymade garments.However, according to three top traders who spoke to the Post, the market seems flooded with Indian goods, which are relatively cheaper.Currently, traders said, an average of 15–20 loaded trucks are entering from Kerung and Tatopani customs points to the north, carrying garments, shoes and slippers, raincoats, and umbrellas, among other items. Before the Covid pandemic, 50–60 loaded trucks used to enter Nepal from the Chinese border at this time of the year.Cost is the key factor in subdued demand.On Friday, the Nepali rupee plunged to an all-time low of Rs134.15 against the dollar. A strong US dollar has advantages and disadvantages. It has negative impacts on an import-based economy like Nepal.“While importing goods, we must pay 30 to 40 percent as customs duty. The high customs duty has made imported goods expensive,” said Kumar Karki. The government needed to ease customs through the coming fiscal year's budget and further tighten it, he said. Importing goods through legal channels is becoming more difficult day by day, especially at the customs, and this has encouraged the illegal import of goods. This has resulted in an import decline.According to the central bank's macroeconomic report, the inflation rate on non-food and services remained at 2.96 percent in mid-May this year, compared to 8.89 percent a year ago. The year-on-year price index of clothes and footwear remained at 3.46 percent.Market analysts, however, say that data presents different facts than the actual market scenario. Economists say that youth are the significant spenders, and demand has declined in sectors like education and restaurants, including consumption of goods and services, as many youths have migrated abroad to study and work.Economist Nara Bahadur Thapa said that import-related activities used to increase by 30 percent with the start of a new fiscal year compared to other months before Covid. However, the number of traders importing goods by opening Letters of Credit (LC) has declined in recent years.“From July to October, imports used to spike and cross Rs200 billion per month, but now, even with the rise in foreign exchange rate, it hardly crosses Rs150 billion. This shows that the demand has declined as a result of economic slowdown,” Thapa said.Thapa said that as people's purchasing power has declined, the demand for different goods in major festival times has declined. The salaries of government and private sector employees have not increased in the past few years. “People are not going to spend unless they have money in their hands.”According to the Department of Customs, Nepal’s imports declined by 1.84 percent to Rs1.45 trillion in the first eleven months of the current fiscal year, which ended in mid-June, compared to the same period last fiscal year.The country’s imports slipped 16.08 percent to Rs1.61 trillion in the last fiscal year. \n\nThe Nepali rupee recorded an all-time low, with Nepal’s central bank fixing the exchange rate at Rs134.15 per US dollar for Friday.The Nepali currency was weakened by 31 paisa against the dollar in a single day. The rupee’s fall is attributed to a steady depreciation of the Indian rupee, to which it is pegged.Experts say Nepal, an import-driven economy, may see a sharp rise in inflation due to the dollar's strength, as almost all goods and services are quoted in dollar terms.Commodities like edible oil, petroleum fuel, and foods are priced in dollars globally, so a stronger dollar adds to the cost of Nepali consumers. As food expenditures make up large shares of consumption, the constant weakening of the local currency makes the goods dearer in Nepal.Traders say apparel prices may rise in the upcoming festival season as they have started to place orders. Kumar Karki, president of the Nepal National Traders’ Federation, said the rising dollar may make goods, particularly apparel and electronics, more expensive during the Dashain and Tihar festivals. According to estimates, sales of food and non-food items surge manifold during the festival period.Traders have already started visiting China to place orders, especially for goods to be imported for festival sales in October, said Karki. Most festival goods, such as readymade clothes, shoes, bags, and accessories, are imported from China.According to media reports, the dollar strengthened as the Swiss National Bank delivered an interest-rate cut, underscoring the divergence in monetary policies among global central banks as the US Federal Reserve delayed easing policy. In India, the central bank has allowed the rupee to weaken, though it intervenes to curb wild swings. Nepali currency automatically strengthens when the Indian currency is strong and weakens when the Indian currency weakens. Nepal has been following a pegged exchange rate system with the Indian rupee.Nepal adopts a different kind of exchange rate system for other convertible currencies.In line with the economic liberalisation policy introduced in the mid-1980s, Nepal introduced current account convertibility in 1993, effectively pegging the Nepali rupee to the Indian rupee at the rate of 1.60, the same rate as in 1960 when the two currencies were first pegged. Since 1993, the exchange rate of the Nepali rupee with other convertible currencies has been market-determined in line with the exchange rate of the Indian rupee with convertible currencies.A strong US dollar has both advantages and disadvantages for a country like Nepal. It benefits some but negatively impacts others.According to Nara Bahadur Thapa, former executive director of Nepal Rastra Bank, the depreciation of the domestic currency could exert pressure on the balance of payments as Nepal would have to spend more money to buy foreign goods.According to him, the depreciation of the domestic currency is likely to worsen inflation, as the country is highly dependent on imported goods and has low domestic output.“The currency’s devaluation makes exports cheaper, measured in foreign currency, and imports become more expensive, measured in the home currency.”The price effect may lead the goods and services sector of Nepal to weaken, said Karki. According to Nepal Rastra Bank, the country’s central bank, in the first ten months of the current fiscal year, merchandise exports decreased by 3.6 percent to Rs126.17 billion.However, merchandise imports amounted to a staggering Rs1.30 trillion in the review period.The most significant impact will be on purchasing petroleum products, Nepal’s biggest import, on which the country is fully dependent. It will also impact the cost of chemical fertiliser.On the other hand, the appreciation of the US dollar can benefit remittance earners. Remittance inflows increased 19.2 percent to Rs1.19 trillion in the review period. Another advantage will be on the foreign exchange reserve, according to experts.Those countries with ample reserves may sell foreign exchange to bolster their currencies. Nepal’s gross foreign exchange reserves increased to a record $14.54 billion in mid-May.Similarly, a soaring US dollar means tourists can buy more of the Nepali currency. Visitors from abroad will find the prices of goods and services in Nepal cheaper with a stronger dollar.Travel income, the money spent by foreigners, increased 35 percent to Rs69.41 billion in the first ten months of the current fiscal year.The strong dollar increases the burden of debt repayment in local currency terms.Thus, as the dollar becomes stronger relative to other currencies, these repayments become more expensive in terms of the domestic currency.The price of gold also increases in the local market when the dollar rises.The Nepali currency vis-à-vis the US dollar depreciated 1.61 percent in mid-May 2024 from mid-July 2023, while it had depreciated 2.79 percent in the same period of the previous year. \nNineteen-year-old Ekta suffers from excruciating pain during her periods. It is far beyond the usual pain and cannot be managed with medication–she’s tried that multiple times. Taking one dose of Meftal (a period pain medication) is never enough. The pain is debilitating most of the time.Despite several visits to gynaecologists, her complaints have been brushed aside as normal period pains. She strongly feels that her pain is abnormal, but feels powerless to address her issues.“The pain is so bad, but I cannot do anything about it,” she says. “I can’t count the number of times that I’ve been told that my debilitating pain is normal,” bemoans Ekta, whose name has been changed to protect her privacy.The normalisation of period pains means serious reproductive conditions like endometriosis often go untreated. People with endometriosis experience severe pelvic pain because tissues like that found outside the uterus grow inside it. Other symptoms of the condition include heavy bleeding during and between periods and fatigue. There is no known cure for this condition, and symptoms can start from the first period onwards.A major challenge experienced by women with endometriosis is the disregard of their symptoms by the public and medical professionals alike. Due to lack of awareness about the debilitating pain typical to endometriosis, both the person suffering from the condition, and their doctors often underestimate their severity.Severe pelvic pain is a key indicator for diagnosing endometriosis, says Dr Reena Shrestha, a gynaecologist at Madhyapur Hospital. When patients seek consultation regarding the kind of severe pain that significantly disrupts their lives, they may undergo two types of tests: transvaginal ultrasound and diagnostic laparoscopy. These procedures are used to determine the presence of endometriosis. Endometriosis is a complex condition, says Dr Hema Pradhan, a consultant gynaecologist at Everest Hospital. Amongst all the patients she meets at her consultations, many frequently turn out to have endometriosis. But, she’s noticed that often patients often delay seeking treatment because period pains are often normalised.“Women who come to me with their symptoms often delay seeking treatment, because, regardless of the severity of their pain, they believe all period pains to be normal,” says Pradhan.Eighteen-year-old Rima (name change) has been struggling with excessive pain before and during periods for years. She also experiences pain while urinating during her periods. Rima has also been diagnosed with Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome (PCOS). The co-occurence of PCOS and endometriosis is not unheard of, although research on them has been minimal.“I can barely walk when I’m on my periods, but I’ve always been told that I should just learn to live with it,” she says.Despite knowing about PCOS, she discovered the possibility of having endometriosis quite later in life. She shares this because period pain, even excessive ones, have been normalised for far too long.The general lack of awareness of endometriosis, and widespread normalisation of period pains, often results in late diagnosis and treatment of the condition.Although there may be no cure to the condition, there are ways to manage its most severe symptoms. Furthermore, receiving a diagnosis can greatly help patients to understand the severity of their condition, according to doctors. “I’m incapable of doing anything during my periods. One time I had to leave the examination in the middle of my exams because of the pain,” says Ekta. “I can’t study, can’t work, all I can do is stay in bed and cry,” she adds.Dr Pradhan reveals another challenging aspect of diagnosing endometriosis. Sometimes the condition may not appear on ultrasound scans initially. Endometrial deposits may appear differently in women due to hormonal changes. Furthermore, symptoms may vary, with some being asymptomatic altogether. According to Dr Shrestha, once a gynaecologist confirms that the patient has endometriosis, they will certainly recommend methods to manage the pain. These include analgesics for pain relief, and home remedies like hot water bag massage.However, the main problem remains. Due to lack of awareness, most patients may only find out about their condition later in life.In some cases women only discover they have endometriosis when they face infertility. Endometriosis is associated with infertility, and 30-50% of people with endometriosis may experience infertility. This also exposes another troubling aspect associated with endometriosis. Ekta shares that her relatives often express concerns about her potential infertility.“They just make me feel bad that I might never get pregnant. And it makes me feel worse,” Ekta adds.Worldwide, endometriosis has been known as a scientifically under-researched condition. It has even been called the ‘missed disease’ because of inconsistencies in its diagnosis and treatment. Endometriosis has also been widely ignored by policy makers.Treatment for endometriosis depends on the individual, says Dr Pradhan. Some are treated with hormonal medication, and others require surgical procedures. The main way to combat endometriosis is timely diagnosis, and timely treatment, she adds.“Raising awareness, timely diagnosis, and treatment are very important,” Dr Pradhan says. \nLast month, a local from Sindhupalchowk district was brought to Sukraraj Tropical and Infectious Disease Hospital to treat a snakebite. Along with the victim, relatives brought the live snake in a bottle to show the doctor as proof.“The snake was a king cobra,” said Dr Yuba Nidhi Basaula, director at the Hospital. “Fortunately, the venom had not penetrated deep into the victim’s body, and after three days of treatment, the victim was discharged. We called a snake handler and handed over the king cobra.”Sindhupalchowk is a mountain district where venomous snakes were thought of as non-existent. However, incidents of king cobra bites in mountain districts like Sindhupalchowk suggest that venomous snakes have started migrating towards hill and mountain districts, and rising temperatures caused by climate change are the main culprit, experts say.Nepal is among the world’s most vulnerable countries to the climate crisis and has witnessed multiple extreme weather events over the past decade and a half.Evidence suggests that maximum temperatures in Nepal are rising at a faster rate of 0.056 degrees Celsius a year, compared to the global average rise of 0.03 degrees Celsius a year. Compared to districts of the Tarai region, those in hills and mountains have been witnessing a more rapid increase in daytime maximum temperatures, which could have helped venomous snakes survive there, experts say.“Not only in Sindhupalchowk, but a king cobra bite was also spotted in Godawari of Lalitpur district last year,” said Basaula. “Snakebite cases have started rising alarmingly of late.”Of the 31 patients admitted to the hospital on Sunday, 16—more than 50 percent—were snakebite cases. Doctors at the hospital say eight to ten snakebite victims seek treatment there every day, and most victims seeking care at the hospital are from the districts of Kathmandu Valley or from those adjoining the Valley.Each year, around 2,700 people, mostly children and women from Nepal’s Tarai region, die of snakebites, according to a March 2022 report published in The Lancet, a leading international medical journal.However, snakebite cases are vastly underreported in the country. The Ministry of Health and Population said that only 14 deaths and 1,220 cases of snakebites had been reported in 11 months of the current fiscal year. Officials admit that venomous snakebite incidents are being reported from hill and mountain districts, and the demand for anti-snake venom is on the rise. They attribute this rise in snakebite incidents to rising temperatures. “Health facilities in some mountainous and hilly districts—like Darchula and Bajura—have asked for anti-snake venom,” said Dr Hemanta Chandra Ojha, an official at the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division. “Snakebite incidents have been on the rise,” said Dr Hemanta Chandra Ojha, an official at the division. “With the onset of the monsoon, people living in the risk areas should remain vigilant.”Every year, the Health Ministry purchases around 25,000 vials of anti-snake venom and distributes them to around 100 snakebite treatment centres in the country.Officials say as snakebite cases surge, so will the demand for additional treatment centres. “This year, we are planning to set up an additional 15 snakebite treatment centres,” said Ojha. Public health experts have urged authorities to launch an awareness drive about the risks. They say people living in thatched-roof houses are particularly vulnerable to snakebites, as snakes often enter such homes in search of rats. They say people should be asked to keep their homes and surroundings clean, prevent children from playing in bushy areas, avoid venturing out at night, and use torchlights while walking in the dark.Likewise, women and children who have to work in fields and go to the jungle are at the highest risk of snakebites. Small children are at risk of dying from snakebites, as they do not tell their parents about the bites on time due to fear of getting scolded for playing in the bushes, according to doctors.“We should make people aware so that they seek medical attention immediately after a snakebite, using whatever means of transport they get,” said Ojha. “The faster you reach the hospital, the greater your chances of survival.” \nA 45-year-old woman from Dhapasi, Kathmandu was diagnosed with high blood pressure, high cholesterol and diabetes some six months ago. Doctors at the National Cardiac Center, who attended to the patient prescribed medicines and advised her to change her lifestyle and eating habits to control the ailments.“The patient, who was worried about her health conditions, took the doctors’ advice seriously and joined a yoga class in the morning, made a drastic change in her eating habits, and engaged in physical activities,” said Dr Om Murti Anil, a senior cardiologist. “Her blood pressure, blood sugar and cholesterol levels are now under control, and she has also reduced her weight. Now, she doesn't need the high dose of medicines like in the past. ”This was a common refrain among a few patients, who took doctors' advice seriously, changed their lifestyles and eating habits, joined yoga classes, and increased physical activity, which helped them control high blood pressure, blood sugar and cholesterol levels.Public health experts say changing eating habits, lessening body weight, and starting physical activities, including yoga and physical exercises, help control non-communicable diseases, which have emerged as a major public health problem in Nepal.Studies show that non-communicable diseases have emerged as a serious public health issue in Nepal, accounting for around 80 percent of total deaths. A 2019 study by the Nepal Health Research Council on the prevalence of noncommunicable diseases found that they accounted for 71 percent of the deaths in the country. The study primarily focused on behavioural risk factors—tobacco and alcohol consumption—and biological risk factors—raised blood pressure, overweight, obesity, abnormal lipid prevalence, coronary artery disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and diabetes. The findings showed that the leading risk factor for death in 2019 was smoking, accounting for 17.7 percent deaths, followed by high systolic blood pressure at 12.3 percent, household air pollution at 11.2 percent, ambient air pollution at 9.3 percent, diabetes at 8 percent, as well as high cholesterol, kidney dysfunction.Additionally, around 8 percent of the deaths were attributed to accidents, including road traffic accidents.“For many patients, doctors have to increase the doses of medicines, as every time they come for follow-up, their reports often get worse,” said Anil. “To reduce weight, change lifestyle and eating habits, strong commitments are needed, and very few people have such determination.”Many patients, despite knowing that they are at high risk of dying due to inactivity, do not change their lifestyle or start physical activity. Doctors warn that non-communicable diseases—hypertension, heart disease, stroke and diabetes, among others—could lead to a public health crisis if not addressed immediately. They blame a sedentary lifestyle and the consumption of processed foods as chief culprits for the growing burden of non-communicable diseases and obesity.They warn that people from all walks of life have been affected by the repercussions of changing lifestyles and food habits. Entire family members suffer if any member, particularly the breadwinner, faces serious health problems.Experts say continuous awareness campaigns about the rising prevalence of non-communicable diseases, the promotion of healthy lifestyles, and the start of yoga classes in community centres, schools, and open-air gyms could help lessen the growing burden of non-communicable diseases. “Physical exercises not only help in managing the disease conditions but also lessen the risk of developing non-communicable diseases,” said Dr Munkarna Thapa, information officer at the Department of Ayurveda and Alternative Medicine. “Along with physical fitness, they contribute to the mental well-being of people.”Meanwhile, department officials said that they have allocated a budget to promote open-air fitness centres, yoga classes, and alternatives, keeping in mind the growing burden of non-communicable diseases in society.Open-air gyms have been set up in public places, and the public can use them free of charge. Apart from setting up outdoor gyms, imparting training to communities and school students and promoting healthy lifestyles to reduce the major risk factors associated with non-communicable diseases, Thapa said.The department, which has already set up open-air fitness centres at the headquarters of all seven provinces, plans to set up 10 more such centres in the upcoming fiscal year. Several local units also have set up such facilities in their areas. \nIn a bid to address the problem of malnutrition in children under five, the Ministry of Health and Population has started imparting training to nurses and paramedics serving in Lumbini, Karnali, and Sudurpaschim provinces.Officials hope that a week-long training programme will help lessen the existing problems of malnutrition in those provinces.“Imparting training to combat malnutrition in small children is our nationwide programme, which we have started from Lumbini, Karnali and Sudurpaschim provinces,” said Lila Bikram Thapa, chief of Nutrition Section at the Family Welfare Division under the Department of Health Services. “Along with imparting training to health workers, we will also launch an awareness drive to improve exclusive breastfeeding practices.”Malnutrition is considered a silent health crisis in Nepal. The country has made significant progress in reducing stunting among children under five, which decreased from 57 percent in 2001 to 25 percent in 2022, according to the Nepal Demographic and Health Survey-2022.The report showed some improvement in the country’s overall nutrition status, but progress is not the same in all provinces.More than 16 percent of the children under five years in Lumbini Province are found to be suffering from wasting—the most immediate, visible, and life-threatening form of malnutrition.Wasting, a debilitating disease that causes muscle and fat tissues to waste away among children under five, decreased from 11 percent in 2001 to eight percent in 2022.Wasting or low weight for one’s height in children, if not treated properly and on time, is associated with a higher mortality risk, according to the World Health Organisation.The report shows that exclusive breastfeeding has been continuously declining, from 70 percent in 2011 to 56 percent last year. Health officials said that studies show that more educated and well-off mothers are less likely to exclusively breastfeed their babies.According to the report, the proportion of children who are bottle-fed rises with increasing mothers’ education, from 12 percent among those whose mothers have no education to 49 percent among those whose mothers have more than a secondary education. Use of a bottle with a nipple is the highest in the highest wealth quintile at 46 percent and lowest in the lowest quintile at 11 percent.Likewise, the proportion of children who are bottle-fed is higher in urban areas, 26 percent, than in rural areas, 15 percent. The use of a bottle with a nipple is lowest in Karnali Province at 11 percent, in Madhesh Province at 12 percent, and the highest in Bagmati Province at 43 percent.Exclusive breastfeeding is the highest in Sudurpaschim and Karnali provinces—74 percent each—and the lowest in Lumbini Province—36 percent.“We have allocated the nutrition budget to launch a nationwide awareness drive about the importance of exclusive breastfeeding in the upcoming fiscal year,” said Thapa. “We have also designated a nutrition focal person at every local unit who is tasked to discourage practices of promoting replacement feeding.”The report also showed that bottle-feeding practices started in health facilities. It showed that 22 percent of children born in a health facility receive mixed milk feeding (breast milk and fresh, packaged, or powdered animal milk or infant formula), as compared with 12 percent of those born at home. Bottle feeding is not recommended, as the nipple on a feeding bottle is susceptible to contamination and increases the risk of diseases among children, according to the World Health Organisation.Health ministry officials hoped that training for nurses and paramedics would help lessen bottle-feeding practices in health facilities.Doctors say breastfeeding should continue for the first two years or beyond, as breast milk lowers children’s risk of illness, promotes their recovery during illness, and remains an important source of nutrients for healthy growth and development.According to them, longer durations of breastfeeding have many health benefits for women, including reduced risks of certain breast and ovarian cancers and diabetes.Nepal had committed to increasing the exclusive breastfeeding rate to more than 90 percent by 2030, but the rate declined from 70 percent in 2011 to 66 percent in 2016 and to 56 percent in 2022. \nThe Stonewall Riots (1969) led to the creation of safe spaces like Inclusive Galaxy Restaurant in Nepal, providing LGBTQIA+ individuals a place to exist openly and access community and support.\nNepali chef Aditya Mishra, after staging at Michelin-starred restaurants, started his supper club 'The Sewing Tin' to promote Nepali cuisine in New York, winning the James Beard Foundation National Scholars Scholarship in 2023.\nCeleus Baral, a student and baker, runs Bakeleus online and at The Yellow House, offering baked goods incorporating her environmental science background and fostering a connection to nature through baking.\nPotatoes, widely consumed in Nepal, are a versatile, nutrient-rich crop with diverse varieties that offer various health benefits, and despite imports and popular processed forms like chips and fries, the vegetable remains a staple especially in mountainous regions due to its adaptability to varying climatic conditions.\nChicken eggs are a nutritious food source, rich in vitamins, minerals, and protein, offering benefits such as weight loss, reduced blood pressure, and protection against infections.\n“How much oxygen do you have for the summit?”I think this is the kind of question a film producer would ask. But when you're on the mountain, the answer is never clear.I have worked for a long time in the film industry and different art areas, especially photography and engraving.Working in various fields and drawing inspiration from them has become a new normal for me. I have made this approach my way of life without even realising it.I took responsibility for producing the last movie I worked on and shot the behind-the-scenes footage for a documentary. By doing so, I witnessed the entire shooting process and the journey of a movie.In the snowy highlands of Turkey, we had to endure the consequences of the changing climate to shoot ‘About Dry Grasses’, directed by Nuri Bilge Ceylan. The highlands used to be snowy in January, but by the time we got there in the same month, there was no snow. Nature was changing. It was responding to what was happening—to what humanity had done to it. In the end, it snowed, and we shot the intense snow scenes we wanted. But since most of our days were sunny, unlike what the director wanted, we had to shoot in the sunset and sunrise hours. As crew members, we spent many days waiting for the sun to set.Production requires creating opportunities, finding solutions, and being creative for a work of art to come true. For this, patience, endurance, calmness, and timing are necessary. On the other hand, nature wanted us to listen to it and wait for the right time.During that time, I witnessed many of nature's lessons. For example, I experienced extreme cold for the first time. We endured temperatures ranging from -33 degrees to +55 degrees. By listening to nature, surrendering to its forces, and working within its limits, we managed to persevere.No matter how much you prepare or plan during the pre-production phase, if you are working in nature, remember that nature will always have the final say.The film was completed, released, and connected with audiences. Its success at Cannes 2023 was followed by my trip to the North Pole for my project. I returned with a mix of wonderful developments, joys, and challenges. During this process, I experienced life and death, happiness and sadness, losses and awards.I realised the value of being able to breathe comfortably a few days after my father's chemotherapy ended. Just a few days earlier, he had said, \"Well done, my daughter. I'm glad you went!\" All the anxiety and hard work, filled with fears at the beginning, were finally behind me.Before going to Everest, when I was on the verge of giving up, defeated by my fears, I remembered my father's words. Everest reminded me of what he said while struggling to breathe, adding a turning point to my life.What does it mean to say ‘life’s turning point?’ How many turning points can there be in life?Who am I, and what am I doing in this world? How well do I know my own limits? Can I find answers to these big questions? These thoughts sparked my dream of journeying to Everest. Now, after returning, I can say that it turned my life around.“How much oxygen do you need for the summit?” sounds more like “How much do you need to hold on to life?” How many reasons do you find that give meaning to your life, keep you alive, and allow you to breathe? How much can you endure in the face of obstacles, and can you keep believing that a solution will eventually come your way?Can these questions be separated from the idea of measuring and assessing something, from learning its quantity and financial value? Can everything be known with certainty? Should the journey be fully understood in advance, with all its promises laid out? Should it be viewed like a purchase with a price tag, asking, “Is this journey worth this much?”I had never trekked before and had no climbing experience. I had lived at sea level my entire life and had never been to a high altitude.However, this journey was not only about the physical climb but also an inner discovery. After losing my father to lung cancer, his breathing difficulties taught me the fragility of breath, life, and existence. I also mentally prepared myself for the physical challenges I might face. Despite all my concerns, could this journey help me understand the cycle of life and the resilience of the soul?So, how could I make this trek possible? How could I land in Nepal? Despite all the economic difficulties and the many things I felt needed organising, I did my best and believed in it.Since I was embarking on this journey, I felt I should share about my travels and inspire others.Starting with photography, cinema, and engraving, which are already integral parts of my life, I dreamed of documenting and sharing the inspiring aspects of this journey.After months of correspondence and dreaming, it all came true. Finally, I embarked on the journey with the goal of creating photographs, engravings, and documentaries. I learned a great deal from my travels in Nepal, from the people I met, and from every moments I witnessed. I felt incredibly fortunate to have been able to honour my father’s memory with the peace and serenity I experienced in the Himalayas.During my 15-day journey to Everest Base Camp, I encountered nature’s masterpieces at every turn. As concerns like “How will I endure?” and “How will I finish?” started to weigh on me, the mountains suddenly parted with the clouds and gazed down at me.It was amazing to witness the appearance of ‘Gods’ that I had never seen before, in such immense size and in such a close, awe-inspiring manner beside me during that silent walk.As someone who came from one of the most crowded cities in the world, Istanbul, while I struggled with my daily questions and uncertainties, trying to control everything, they stood there calmly, as if answering me.They were just there—before and after.My guide, Lakhpa Sherpa, always reminded me not to worry about how high we were, how long it would take to reach our accommodation, or what the weather would be like. He encouraged me to live in the moment, and he was right.He advised me to focus on my breathing, not to get thirsty, to eat enough, and to appreciate the extraordinary beauty of the journey. In the mountains, plans dissolve and each moment is embraced as it comes.All the good wishes, prayers, and everything encountered along the way were for the journey itself. The mountain was full of life, secrets, and everything I had wondered about.This 15-day journey to Everest Base Camp was a solo adventure, yet I wouldn't have been able to complete it without my guide, Lhakpa, and my porter. Additionally, I was fortunate enough to experience the hospitality, generosity, and honesty at Trekkers Paradise, which organised the entire journey and provided guidance.I witnessed how dedication and sincerity are crucial in completing a journey safely and healthily. Ghanshyam Sharma, from Trekkers Paradise and Sauraj Jhingan, a climber who summited the Everest in 2018, shared their experiences with me during the journey.They experienced the 2015 earthquake while they were at the Everest Base Camp.As a filmmaker, their role as actors, and attention to detail played a significant role in bringing my dream photography and documentary project to life.The sponsors of my journey were Turkish Airlines, The North Face, Apple, Canon, and Stanley. My supporters include Oscar International College and Nepal Film Campus. Throughout the journey, I shared many experiences, memories, and countless photos and images with my students.On my way back home after 21 days, I celebrated my birthday on the plane. From the right window, the Himalayas bid me farewell. I felt like I had opened a new chapter in my life, and I was certain that I would return.I had made many friends and memories in Nepal.For now, I will be working on a documentary and preparing for a photography and engraving exhibition titled ‘My Soul Beyond the Mountain’.To the Himalayas: This summer was spent with you, but we will meet again soon. \nA group of journalists embarked on a five-day tour of Sri Lanka, exploring its rich cultural heritage, religious sites, natural landscapes, and economic recovery in the wake of financial challenges.\nMundhum Trek in Koshi province in the eastern part of Nepal is a new cultural walking trail. It passes through several indigenous ethnic villages and landscapes in Khotang and Bhojpur districts. This trail goes up to an elevation of 4,200 metres to the viewpoint of Silchung Peak and takes one through the settlements of the Kirati people. This route starts from Diktel Bazaar and passes through beautiful settlements like Chakhewa, Rawa Dhap, Salpa Bhanjyang, Silchung and Hanspokhari before ending in Bhojpur. There are some hotels in Diktel but trekkers are advised to carry tents. The trail offers panoramic views of most of the eight-thousanders, including Everest, Lhotse, Makalu, Cho Oyu and Kanchenjunga mountains. The spring season, March through May, is highly recommended for the trek.Janaki Mandir Janaki Mandir at Janakpur in Madhesh province was constructed in 1874 and is a blend of Mughal and local architecture. The temple is a three-storey building and has 60 rooms, making it the largest temple in Nepal. Pilgrims flock here by the thousands to pay homage to Janaki Mandir—Janaki being the other name of Sita, the daughter of King Janak. The temple houses an idol of Sita which was found near Ayodhya, the kingdom of Ram. The marriage anniversary of Lord Ram and Sita is celebrated in Janakpur every year on Vivaha Panchami, which falls in December. In the southwest corner of Janaki Mandir is the Vivaha Mandap, which has been built at the site where the marriage of Ram and Sita is said to have taken place. Another well-known temple in the vicinity is Ram Mandir, which is built in pagoda style and is hence different from the other temples in Janakpur that generally bear resemblance to Mughal architecture. It houses a female statue, said to be of Yogamaya, which has the reputation of being one of the most beautiful images of female forms in Nepal. Other holy sites of interest include the Laxman Temple, Sankat Mochan Temple and Hanuman Temple.Kuri Village, Kalinchok Kuri village, a popular tourist destination around 150 km from Kathmandu, lies at an altitude of 3,842 metres above sea level in Kalinchowk of Dolakha district, in Bagmati province. People visit the place to enjoy the snow during the winter besides the mesmerising landscapes and splendid panoramic view of the Himalayan range. Kalinchok gets snow mainly at the end of December and the snowfall continues till the end of February or mid-March. When there is snow, it is difficult for jeeps, buses and cars to reach the top of Kuri village. Chains are wrapped around the wheels of vehicles and specially modified jeeps with highly experienced drivers are used to carry visitors. There are several hotels and restaurants in the area. The road up to Kuri has also improved over the years.Annapurna Base Camp Annapurna Base Camp trek, in Gandaki province, makes for a picturesque journey that takes you to the foothills of the Annapurna South, up to 4,130 metres above sea level. The five-day trek (seven days for slow walkers) offers rich cultural diversities, typical Nepali villages and the flora and fauna nestled at the foothills of Annapurna. The distance from Pokhara to Annapurna Base Camp is approximately 81 kilometres. It is among the shortest and most budget-friendly treks in Nepal. For Nepalis, lodging costs around $5 to $10 per day. For foreigners, the overall cost of the trek ranges from $800 to $1500 on average per person. Annapurna Base Camp trek can be done at any time throughout the year as each season offers a different trekking experience. The ideal time for the trek depends on your weather preferences and what you expect from it. However, autumn (September to October) and spring (March to May) are considered the two best seasons for the trek, as the days at the time are warm and bright with clear skies.Bardiya National Park Bardiya National Park, located in the southern Tarai belt of Lumbini province, is home to one of the most elusive and majestic animals on earth—the Royal Bengal Tiger. The park, which covers an area of 968 square kilometres, is considered one of the most important protected areas in the country. It is a prime destination for those looking to catch a glimpse of a tiger. A bit of luck and patience will offer a good chance to see the Bengal Tiger. The jungle safari also offers one the opportunity to spot Asian elephants and the greater one-horned rhinoceros. The rare Gangetic river dolphins are occasionally spotted on rafting trips along the Geruwa River, the eastern channel of the Karnali river. Besides, visitors can enjoy the homestays and explore local Tharu culture. The right time to visit the park is from mid-September to mid-December and mid-February to May.Khaptad National Park Khaptad National Park in Sudurpaschim province is a protected area in the far western region. It stretches over four districts of Bajhang, Bajura, Achham and Doti and ranges in elevation from 1,400 to 3,300 metres. The park can be visited throughout the year. Trekkers are advised to bring their tents, food and other supplies. The Nepal Tourism Board says of late, social media has been increasingly influencing Nepali travellers to go to Khaptad. Since the far-flung Khaptad National Park is still offbeat for many travellers, the area remains pristine and fresh. The seasons of spring (March-May) and autumn (October-November) are the ideal times to visit the park. The temperature ranges from 10°c to 20°c offering pleasant trekking weather. The monsoon begins in June and lasts until September and during this time, roads often become muddy and slippery.

The nationality of the remaining deceased worker was not yet confirmed, fire official Kim Jin-young told reporters, citing information from company officials.The blaze began at 10:31 a.m. (0131 GMT) after a series of battery cells exploded inside a warehouse with some 35,000 units, Kim said. What had triggered the explosion remains unclear, he said.A Reuters journalist saw firefighters moving up to six bodies out of the factory. Due to the intensity of the blaze, rescuers were finding it difficult to identify the dead, Kim said.Two people were being treated for major burns, officials at the scene said.Live TV footage showed firefighters spraying the damaged steel and concrete building. Parts of the upper level had collapsed, and large chunks of the building looked like they had been blown out into the street by explosions.Aerial footage showed massive white smoke clouds billowing from the structure and explosions rolling through the building.Kim Jae-ho, Fire and Disaster Prevention professor at Daejeon University, said the fire had probably spread too quickly for workers to escape.“Battery materials such as nickel are easily flammable,” he said. “So often, there is not enough time to respond, compared to a fire caused by other materials.”President Yoon Suk Yeol visited the scene of the accident later on Monday. Interior Minister Lee Sang-min called on the local authorities to take steps to prevent any hazardous chemicals from contaminating the surrounding area.Established in 2020, Aricell makes lithium primary batteries for sensors and radio communication devices. It has 48 employees, according to its latest regulatory filing and its Linkedin profile.Calls to Aricell offices were unanswered.The company is not listed on South Korea’s stock market but is majority owned by S-Connect, according to the Aricell regulatory filing. S-Connect is registered on the junior Kosdaq index and its shares closed down 22.5%.Park Chul-wan at Seojeong University said Aricell is known to use extremely toxic material, which could explain the high death toll.“The fact that there were so many casualties when this was on only the second floor is because of the toxic materials and not so much because of burns,” he said.South Korea has made efforts to improve its safety record after several past accidents, many of which have been blamed on negligence.Each year dozens of workers are killed in industrial accidents, which prompted parliament to pass a law aimed at punishing the executives of a company in the event of a fatal accident with possible jail terms.South Korea is also home to major producers of lithium-ion batteries that power electric vehicles (EVs) and the world’s fifth largest automakers, Hyundai Motor Group, which are making a push to shift away from internal combustion cars to EVs. \nRussian guided bombs shattered an apartment building in Ukraine’s second-largest city on Saturday, killing three people, injuring 52 and prompting President Volodymyr Zelenskiy to call for more help to deal with the growing threat of such weapons.Pictures posted online showed parts of the five-storey apartment building in ruins, with windows smashed, balconies wrecked and rubble strewn about a crater on the ground.Prosecutors in Ukraine’s eastern Kharkiv region put the casualty toll at three dead and 52 injured in the mid-afternoon attack, including three injured children. Regional Governor Oleh Syniehubov said four of those hurt were in serious condition.“This Russian terror through guided bombs must be stopped and can be stopped,” Zelenskiy wrote on Telegram.“We need strong decisions from our partners to enable us to stop the Russian terrorists and Russian military aviation right where they are.”Later, in his nightly video address, Zelenskiy said Russian forces had used more than 2,400 guided bombs on Ukrainian targets in June alone, with about 700 aimed at Kharkiv.He said after US Congress gave delayed approval of a big aid package in April, Ukraine's replenished arms supplies had reduced the devastation and frequency of missile attacks and the same had to be done now to fend off these bombs.“The significant reduction in Russian missile terror against Kharkiv and the region proves it is entirely possible to secure our cities and communities from Russian bombs,” he said.Ukraine, he said, needed promised military aid packages “without delay so that the agreements we reached with (US) President Biden can be realised.”Ukraine and the US signed a 10-year bilateral security agreement this month aimed at bolstering Ukraine's defense against Russia and getting Ukraine closer to NATO membership.Russia has relied increasingly on relatively inexpensive guided bombs, dropped from a distance and involving fewer risks for its forces.Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022 and has advanced slowly through Donetsk region in the east, capturing a string of villages since seizing the key industrial town of Avdiivka more than three months ago.It launched a cross-border incursion north of Kharkiv last month, though Zelenskiy says the situation there has stabilised.In the latest bomb attack, Mayor Ihor Terekhov said there had been four strikes on Kharkiv.Regional governor Syniehubov said rescue work was proceeding at the building, which housed a store on the ground floor.Kharkiv Police Chief Serhiy Bolvinov told public broadcaster Suspilne that three floors had collapsed, but he believed no one was trapped under the rubble.Kharkiv lies about 30 km (20 miles) from the border with Russia. The city of 1.3 million people has frequently been targeted in Russian attacks during nearly 28 months of war.Moscow denies deliberately targeting civilians but thousands have been killed and injured in the war. \nA shooter opened fire at an Arkansas supermarket on Friday, killing three civilians and wounding 10 other people, including two police officers, Arkansas State Police said.The suspect was also wounded in a shootout with police, Arkansas State Police Director Mike Hagar told reporters.The shooting occurred at the Mad Butcher grocery in Fordyce, a town of 3,200 people about 70 miles (112 km) south of Little Rock.“Unfortunately, we can confirm that 11 innocent civilians were shot, and three of those are deceased. Two law enforcement officers were injured in the exchange of gunfire. The suspect was also shot and taken into custody,” Hagar said. He did not explain the circumstances of the shooting or take questions.The wounded police officers and the suspect were expected to survive, he said.Civilian injuries ranged from non-life-threatening to extremely critical, he said.Governor Sarah Huckabee Sanders said on social media platform X that she was briefed on the incident.“I am thankful to law enforcement and first responders for their quick and heroic action to save lives. My prayers are with the victims and all those impacted by this horrific incident,” she said. \nSummaryIsraeli strikes kill at least 45 Palestinians in GazaForces pound southern city of RafahIsrael says forces carrying out ‘precise, intelligence-based’ actionsIsraeli military finds militants’ tunnels in Rafah, it saysIsraeli forces pounded Rafah in southern Gaza on Friday, as well as other areas across the enclave, killing at least 45 Palestinians as troops engaged in close-quarter combat with Hamas militants, residents and Israel’s military said.Residents said the Israelis appeared to be trying to complete their capture of Rafah, which borders Egypt and has been the focus of an Israeli assault since early May.Tanks were forcing their way into the western and northern parts of the city, having already captured the east, south and centre.Firing from planes, tanks and ships off the coast caused more people to flee the city, which a few months ago was sheltering more than a million displaced people, most of whom have now relocated again.The Gaza health ministry said at least 25 Palestinians had been killed in Mawasi in western Rafah and 50 wounded. Palestinians said a tank shell hit a tent housing displaced families.“Two tanks climbed a hilltop overseeing Mawasi and they sent balls of fire that hit the tents of the poor people displaced in the area,” one resident told Reuters over a chat app.The Israeli military said that the incident was under review. “An initial inquiry conducted suggests that there is no indication that a strike was carried out by the IDF (Israel Defence Forces) in the Humanitarian Area in Al-Mawasi,” it said.Earlier, the military said its forces were conducting “precise, intelligence-based” actions in the Rafah area, where troops were involved in close-quarter combat and had located tunnels used by militants.Over the past week, the military said, troops targeted a university that served as a Hamas headquarters from which militants fired on soldiers and found weapons and barrel bombs. It did not name the university.In the central Gaza area of Nusseirat, the military said soldiers killed dozens of militants over the past week and found a weapons depot containing mortar bombs and military equipment belonging to Hamas.Some residents said the Israeli onslaught on Rafah had intensified in the previous two days and that the sounds of explosions and gunfire had hardly stopped.“Last night was one of the worst nights in western Rafah: Drones, planes, tanks, and naval boats bombarded the area. We feel the occupation is trying to complete the control of the city,” said Hatem, 45, reached by text message.“They are taking heavy strikes from the resistance fighters, which may be slowing them down.”STRIKES ON KHAN YOUNIS AND GAZA CITYMore than eight months into the war in Gaza, Israel’s advance is now focused on the two last areas its forces had yet to seize: Rafah on Gaza’s southern edge and the area surrounding Deir al-Balah in the centre.“The entire city of Rafah is an area of Israeli military operations,” Ahmed Al-Sofi, the mayor of Rafah, said in a statement carried by Hamas media on Friday.“The city is living through a humanitarian catastrophe and people are dying inside their tents because of Israeli bombardment.”Sofi said no medical facility was functioning in the city, and that remaining residents and displaced families lacked the minimum daily needs of food and water.Palestinian and UN figures show that fewer than 100,000 people may have remained in the far western side of the city, which had been sheltering more than half of Gaza’s 2.3 million people before the Israeli assault began in early May.In nearby Khan Younis, an Israeli air strike on Friday killed three people, including a father and son, medics said.In parallel, Israeli forces continued a new push back into some Gaza City suburbs in the north of the enclave, where they fought with Hamas-led militants.On Friday, an Israeli air strike on a Gaza City municipal facility killed five people, including four municipal workers, the territory’s Civil Emergency Service said. Rescue teams were searching the rubble for more missing victims.In the nearby Beach camp, an Israeli air strike on a house killed at least seven people, medics said.Palestinian health officials said at least 45 Palestinians were killed in Israeli strikes across Gaza on Friday.The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) said its Gaza office was damaged when heavy-calibre projectiles landed nearby, in an area where hundreds of displaced Palestinians are living in tents.“This grave security incident is one of several in recent days; previously stray bullets have reached ICRC structures,” the organization said in a post on X on Friday.“We decry these incidents that put the lives of humanitarians and civilians at risk.”Israel’s ground and air campaign was triggered when Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel on Oct. 7, killing around 1,200 people and seizing more than 250 hostages, according to Israeli tallies.The offensive has left Gaza in ruins, killed more than 37,400 people, according to Palestinian health authorities, and left nearly the entire population homeless and destitute.The United Nations said on Friday it is Israel’s responsibility - as the occupying power in the Gaza Strip - to restore public order and safety in the Palestinian territory so humanitarian aid can be delivered, amid warnings of imminent famine. \nNepal’s book market is no stranger to the popular Bangladeshi-Swedish writer Taslima Nasrin. Almost all of her books have been translated into Nepali, but Nasrin herself says that they are all unauthorised translations. “All books [Nepali translations] are pirated versions,” Nasrin told the Post in a Whatsapp conversation. Nasrin, who is currently in exile in India after facing death threats in Bangladesh following the publication of her novel Lajja (Shame), said that she or her publishers have never allowed anyone the right to translate her books into Nepali. “I don’t know of any such Nepali publishers. No one asked for permission and no one has paid [me] royalty.”Translating and publishing books without permission from authors or publishers is a punishable crime. But Nepal’s book market is full of such unauthorised translations and prints of books written by the who’s who of the world literature. Such endeavours haven’t just hurt the authors but also the readers, says Ajit Baral, publisher of the Kathmandu-based Fineprint publication. “These translations are poor,” Baral says. “Tomes with 1200–1300 pages have been trimmed to 200–300 pages. An example is the biography of Bill Clinton.”Another popular book that has seen unauthorised Nepali translation is the biography of Steve Jobs by Walter Isaacson.“We have no official deal in place for a [Nepali] translation of Steve Jobs,” Peppa Mignone, associate agent of the CAA, the translation authority of the biography, said in an email interview with the Post.The book’s Nepali translation is published by Panchpokhari Publication House. The translated book identifies the translator thus: “Achyut Koirala, who has a master’s in English literature, is primarily a journalist. He is currently affiliated with Nagarik daily. He keeps a close tab on international history, politics and culture and has written scripts and dialogues for half a dozen Nepali films. He has published over a dozen non-fiction books.”Koirala, who admits to the unauthorised translation, claims that he hasn’t just translated the book but has also done ‘creative writing’ with it.‘Rich Dad Poor Dad’, written by Robert Kiyosaki and Sharon Lechter, is among the books that’s perennially on the bestseller list across the world. Upon investigation, the Post found three Nepali translations of the book—all unauthorised. One of them is translated by Dilip Kumar Shrestha and published by the same firm, the Panchpokhari Publication House. Another Nepali iteration of the book is published by Book For All publication and translated by Kopila MD. Yet another Nepali version is translated by one Sudheer Dixit and published by Plata Publication, Kathmandu.In an email conversation with the Post, Ronson Taylor, who oversees the international rights at The Rich Dad Company, said, “At this point in time, we do not have a relationship with an established publisher in the [Nepali] language market. If there are any Rich Dad Poor Dad books currently for sale in the Nepali market, they are pirated.”Basanta Thapa, a writer and translator, says that many books are being translated of late to make easy money. “But how would the quality of these unauthorised translations be!” Thapa wonders. “Readers who haven’t read the original wouldn’t know the faults in the translated versions.” Thapa says that any translator worth his salt aims to ‘recreate’ a book and it takes much work to do that.Taslima’s books are the major victimsTaslima’s memoir Uttal Hawa has been translated into Nepali as ‘Sangharsha’, literally Struggle, and is published by Khoji Publication House. Even though the book in its cover claims that it is an authorised translation from the English version Wild Wind, it is a pirated one. The book is translated by Bikash Basnet and edited by Bhogiraj Chamling. A revised version of the book is edited by Sangeet Srota (Yam Bahadur Chhetri).The same publication house has also published the Nepali translation of the book’s sequel as ‘Prem ra Jeevan’. Publisher Sushil Chalise says that while he is aware that one needs to receive permission from the author or the publisher to translate a book, his efforts to contact Taslima were unsuccessful. Therefore, he had published the version the translator made available to him. Translator Basnet, too, admits he translated the book without Taslima’s permission. “About a decade back, we didn’t know how to ask for permission,” he said.Nepal has the Copyright Act (2002) in place. Before it, there was the The Patent, Design and Trade Mark Act, 2022 (1965) that included intellectual property in its 2006 revision. Even the Muluki Ain (Civil Code) of 1910 BS had a provision about copyright. Moreover, it goes without saying that translating somebody else’s work without permission is immoral.Likewise, Indigo Ink Pvt Ltd has published a Nepali translation of Taslima’s anthology of essays No Country for Women as ‘Aaimai ko Kunai Desh Chhaina’. The book is translated by Krishna Giri and edited by Pramod Pradhan. “I have no idea about the agreement between the publisher and translator,” Pradhan, who is also a children’s book writer, says. “I just copy-edited it upon request.”Bishnukumar Poudel, publisher of Indigo Ink, however, claims that he is still trying to take translation rights for the book. “We translated the book long ago,” he says. “We are still trying to get translation rights.”Indigo is also publishing unauthorised translations under its imprints All Book Store Pvt Ltd, Book for All and Plata Publication. It has published two versions of Rich Dad Poor Dad under those shadow imprints. But Plata Publication is not registered in the Company Registrar’s Office.Pradhan says that many foreign books have had unauthorised translations in Nepali and their quality is poor. Those books are translated not from the original language but from a second or third language, so these translations are bound to have problems, he says. “After I learned that those were unauthorised translations, I have stopped editing them,” Pradhan said.Indian author Shiv Khera’s You Can Win has been translated into Nepali by Bloomsbury India and has granted the distribution rights to Ekta Books. But the book’s unauthorised translations are also found in the market and they don’t even mention the name of the publisher and translator. What is interesting is they mention that it’d be illegal to republish the book, or an excerpt of it, without the author’s permission.The Nepali translation of the book, which was poorly written and rife with inaccuracies, had landed the publisher at court. After a complaint was filed at the District Court Kathmandu in 2066BS on the charge that the publisher violated the copyrights and economic rights, the court had issued a verdict on Mangsir 11 that year, charging a fine of Rs10,000, Rs20,000 and Rs30,000 to the defendants Netra Prasad Pokharel, Narayan Prasad Bhusal, and Bhagwati Risal and Bishnu Silwal, respectively.Baral, the Fineprint publisher, says that international publishers wouldn’t demand much for translation rights given Nepal’s small market, but Nepali publishers do not bother to reach out to them. “Publishers who put out unauthorised translations and sell them at 50 percent discount have troubled publishers like us,” he said.Fineprint has published authorised translated versions of books such as Leaving Microsoft to Change the World by John Wood, Healed by Manisha Koirala, and Hippie by Paulo Coelho. The publication house is also set to release the Nepali translation of Israeli historian Yuval Noah Harari’s bestseller Sapiens. Translated into Nepali by Dinesh Kafle, the book’s translation right was acquired at the cost of USD1300, Baral said. Likewise, the publication acquired the translation rights of Sadhguru’s Inner Engineering at IRS93,000, he added.Baral says that publication of unauthorised translations is an immoral and illegal work. “This phenomenon not just hampers Nepal’s fledgling book publishing industry but also tarnishes the country’s reputation in the global market,” Baral said.Thapa, the writer and translator, points out the lack of regulatory mechanisms in the country. “We don’t have an agency that regulates the quality of translations being done,” he says. “Nobody compares the translation with the original. We need a dedicated authority to enhance the quality of translation.” Universities, Nepal Academy and other stakeholders can play a role to uplift the translation sector, he adds.One’s pain, another’s pleasureWhen the author Suketu Mehta was travelling through Mumbai, a young man approached him with a handful of books while his vehicle was stuck in traffic. Brandishing Maximum City, written by none other than Mehta himself, the young man requested the author to buy a copy. Suketu leafed through the book and said, “This is a pirated copy and I’m the author of this book.” The youth wasn’t bothered and replied, “Okay, you can buy it at a discount.”This anecdote was shared to the Post by Mehta’s friend, the author and professor Amitava Kumar, in an email exchange.Most of these pirated books are imported into Nepal from India while the retailers of original books are finding themselves increasingly in trouble. “We sell original copies but many readers doubt us as well, given the ubiquity of pirated versions,” says Anjan Shrestha, operator of Education Book House, Jamal.Ramchandra Timothy, chair of Thapathali-based Ekta Books Pvt Ltd, said that the phenomenon of piracy has tarnished Nepal’s image internationally. “There was a time when Bangladesh would be known as ‘piracy king’,” he said. “Now there's a risk Nepal would take the crown.”As tax increases, so does piracyThe government decision to impose a 10 percent tax on book imports in fiscal year 2019-20 led to a proliferation of pirated book markets, booksellers say. After the decision, booksellers started to cut back on imports and that led to the entry of a new crop of pirated booksellers, a trader in Kathmandu says. But following widespread backlash, then finance minister Bishnu Paudel struck down the policy.“After the government’s decision, we stopped importing books for a while,” says Shrestha of Education Books. “The import of books went down for about two years. Then the pirates stepped in to fill the gap. It was about that time that pirated copies of biographies and memoirs of Obamas and Jai Shettys became omnipresent in the market.”Pirated copies of classics by Roald Dahl and JK Rowling also made an entry in the Nepali market. Then the phenomenon only saw a rise.Since the customs department does not levy duty on foreign books and also does not care to differentiate between the pirated and original copies, unauthorised books have found a safe haven in Nepali market.The government doesn’t levy any customs duty on books and newspapers published by foreign publishers abroad. The importers should only pay Rs565 at the customs points. But Nepali publishers have to pay 10 percent tax to import books printed in India.James Taylor, director of Communications and Freedom to Publish of the International Publishers Association, says that the government, publishers, writers and readers should join hands to control widespread piracy. “The government should realise that book publishing and reading culture contribute to the country’s economy as well,” he said, adding that the government should seize pirated books and close websites that sell pirated ebooks.Nandan Jha, executive vice chair of Penguin Random House India’s sales, production and business department, says that piracy has emerged as a big challenge for publishers of late and has harmed the authors, publishers, distributors, printers, readers and other stakeholders. “To confront piracy, all the stakeholders should launch a special joint effort,” Jha told the Post in an email exchange.Piracy has proliferated in the Nepali market to such an extent that the publishers of such books and unauthorised translations keep whatever ISBN numbers they like, often conflicting with other books, and still get off scot free. If scanned or searched on the internet, the ISBN number gives details on the author of the book, what the book is about, and its price, among others.Bijay Sharma, information officer at TU Library, says, “Keeping ISBN number at one’s will is illegal. If anyone files a complaint, we can punish them.”By the lawThe Muluki Ain-1910 BS had mandated that a publisher take permission of Gorkha Bhasa Prakashini Samiti before publishing any material. The Copyrights Act came into effect in 2022 BS and was amended in 2054 BS. In 2059 BS, a new Act was promulgated and it is still effective now. Authorities are currently working to amend the Act to give the registrar’s office more autonomy regarding copyright.According to the 2059 BS Act, copyright violations are considered government cases. In such cases, plaintiffs should file a complaint with the police. The Act’s clause 25 has various conditions that amount to violation of copyright. The Act’s subclause A says that if a publisher produces or copies material in writing or sound and sells or distributes it, it amounts to violation of copyright.Likewise, the Act’s clause 26 prevents selling of unauthorised material. The clause restricts the ‘importation of copies of work or sound recording, either made in a foreign country or sourced otherwise, into Nepal for business purpose shall not be permitted if preparation of such copies would be considered illegal if they were prepared in Nepal.’If anyone infringes upon protected rights, they are liable to punishment but the provision’s implementation remains lax.The law gives the authority to district court to take legal action against copyright violators.Advocate Parshuram Koirala says that if the government becomes more proactive, it can punish violators on the basis of the 2059 BS Act and thereby control the phenomenon of intellectual theft and copyright violations. “Creation is a crucial part of humanity’s benefit,” he says. “If intellectual property is not protected effectively, then there’d be no inspiration to create something.”Bal Bahadur Mukhiya, a professor at Nepal Law Campus, suggests the inclusion of rules about digital piracy in law, and also the clauses of various related international treaties and agreements that Nepal is part of.“In the US, a teacher or professor should pay a certain revenue even to photocopy a chapter of some text for teaching purposes,” Mukhiya says. “But in Nepal, those who photocopy an entire book and sell it go scot free.”(This report is prepared in collaboration with the Centre for Investigative Journalism, Nepal.) \nBharat Budha, chair of Putha Uttarganga Rural Municipality’s ward 10, knows that many youths from his village have made it to the United States via ‘tallo bato’—backdoor route—and that many are still on the way. He also knows that eight of them have been deported from the country and that they have lost a cumulative Rs45 million in the process. The deported youths say that they returned home empty-handed after facing unspeakable ordeals and lost Rs6 million each on average.The Tak village in Rukum East—a close-knit settlement of 425 houses—was considered the Maoists’ ‘base area’ during the insurgency. Village youths who reached the US through illegal routes and got deported have lost an estimated Rs40 million. The number of those who returned without completing the journey and the amount they lost remain unknown.To get to the US, the youths have taken loans at up to 36 percent interest per annum from their relatives and village landowners. In Tak village, at least one person each from half of the households has gone abroad, Budha said. “Youths started going to America about six-seven years ago,” he said. “If they could gather enough money, the whole village would try to go to the US.” Budha’s own son had reached the US illegally in 2017, spending Rs3.2 million.During the insurgency, outsize slogans of revolution would adorn the walls of houses in the village. Hoping for a better life, people from all walks of life helped out the Maoists. But now, village youths are paying the agents to illegally get to the US—a country that the Maoists used to call their ‘enemy’, an ‘imperialistic force’. This has cost the Tak village much and in multiple ways.Death of a dreamSome of the deported youths have chosen to flee the village altogether, burdened with debt and creditors’ pressure. At least five such families have already left, said a resident. The family of Ram Budha was one of them. On April 28, 2015, Ram, who had returned to Nepal after working in Malaysia for eight years, took the illegal route to the US. He travelled through arduous trails for months and finally arrived in the country. Upon reaching the country, he was detained and had to stay at the detention camp for 27 months. When his refugee application was rejected, he was deported to Nepal in mid-December 2019. He lost Rs4.5 million in the process. He now owes over Rs6 million to creditors. “After the creditors began to put pressure on me, I couldn’t live in the village peacefully,” said Ram, who currently runs a vegetable farm in Tarakeshwar, Kathmandu.While those who got to the US through illegal routes and fortunately got refugee status there narrate their stories with pride, those who have been deported or returned from half-way have tragic tales to tell.Nanda Kala Gharti, who lives in a small stone house on the upper flank of Tak village, spends her days in melancholy. Her husband, Dhanlal, had chosen to take the illegal route to the US, and Nanda Kala, a mother of four, is living with the repercussions of his decision. Dhanlal had got into the US after a six-month long arduous journey and was detained immediately. He had to spend four years in the detention camp, before he was deported to Nepal. He had already lost Rs6 million.Nanda Kala said they now have an insurmountable crisis in their hands. Pointing to her son, she exclaimed, “When will he grow up, go abroad and pay back the loans!”Dhanlal himself tried to go to Croatia once and spent 15 days in Kathmandu for the process. But after he was turned down, he returned home dejected. “Now we will submit the passport to another agent [for Dhanlal’s trip abroad],” Nanda Kala said. “There’s no point staying here.”Stories that echo each otherThe situation in Sisne Rural Municipality is similar to that of Putha Uttarganga. Here, one can hear plenty of stories of those who have tried to go to the US and those who are fighting refugee cases there. Krishna Regmi, chair of the rural municipality, personally knows seven people who have been deported from the US.Gangaram Khadka, a resident of Sisne-3, runs a bee and chicken farm. Like other young men in his village, Khadka had headed off to the US via an illegal route on 27 March, 2018. He had reached the US via the New Delhi-Moscow-Barcelona-Bogota-Panama-Costa Rica-Nicaragua-Honduras-Guatemala-Mexico route. When he finally arrived in the US, he was detained and had to spend 11 months in detention. He was deported on 15 March, 2019. He had handed over Rs3.2 millions to the agent and spent Rs2 million to fight the case to become a refugee. “It’s not possible for me to pay back the loan while working in Nepal,” he said. “I aim to pay back some interest and head off abroad again.”For six months after Khadka was deported, he had anxiety and headache, he said, adding the three people from his village who were deported like him are also struggling with their mental health.Tikaram Pun, a 40-year-old resident of Bohora village in Musikot-4, is also haunted by his past journey. In September 2017, he reached the US after crossing 17 countries with the help of organised human traffickers. Of the 41 people in his group, 31 were from Rukum East and Rukum West, he said. Pun, who was detained on arrival in the US, spent 24 months in a detention camp. His refugee application was also refused and so he was deported along with eight other Nepalis. “When I returned, I started having mental health problems. I still suffer from them,” he said. Pun is under pressure from creditors and relatives to pay back the Rs9.2 million loan he had taken for the task.Those who died on the wayA group of 10 Bangladeshis and seven Nepalis, including Rupak Bohora of Bafikot-3 in Rukum West, were on a mission to reach Costa Rica through Colombia, Caribbean Coast, Capuragana and Panama. But while they were crossing a sea, their boat capsized. As many as 12 died in the incident, including six Nepalis. Rupak’s wife, Geeta, learned about the incident only after six days, on 25 June, 2021.“I still don’t know what exactly happened,” said Geeta, who had been married off at age 19 and is now a mother of two daughters. The only thing she knows is that Rupak has died and she is now all alone. And that she has Rs5 million in loan taken for Rupak’s trip. She showed a picture of her husband on her phone to this scribe and said, “I only have memories.”Lack of political will and legal remediesThe concrete bridge over Chewang river is on the edge of Tak village. On the walls of the bridge are paintings of political theorists like Marx, Engels, Lenin, Stalin and Mao, and the iconic slogan, ‘Workers of the world, unite!’, below them. But the slogan appears to be at odds with life in the village. Given the phenomenon of illegal travels to the US through the help of organised human traffickers, the whole village appears to be emptying. Neither the local governments are concerned about the phenomenon nor are the political parties paying attention.Puniraj Gharti, chair of Putha Uttarganga Rural Municipality, said though the trend is worrying, there’s nothing he can do. “How could we stop them from making the trip when they are struggling to make a living in the village?” he said.Krishna Regmi, chair of Sisne Rural Municipality, said that the vicious cycle of poverty started after marijuana farming was banned in the country. Then the Maoist insurgency added to the woe, forcing youths to migrate. The signing of the peace agreement in 2006 didn’t herald any change in the economy either and youths are struggling to get jobs. Organised human traffickers are cashing in on this sorry state of affairs, Regmi said. “Meter byajis [usurious lenders] are also promoting this phenomenon,” he added.The phenomenon is equally rife in Dang’s Tulsipur and Ghorahi. Ramesh Kumar Pandey, chair of Ghorai-15, says that even though many heading to the US are swindled, no complaints are filed at the ward office. “Only those who attempt to go to Saudi Arabia or Qatar file the complaints,” he said.One can infer from Pandey’s statements that the families of such illegal travellers don’t want to publicise the ordeals of their family members. On the one hand, agents threaten them to not publicise the issue; on the other, they fear they themselves would be punished by law.According to the Anti-Human Trafficking Bureau, as many as 178 Nepalis, including 174 men, have been deported from the US in the five fiscal years after 2018-19. Of them, the highest 49 are from Rukum while 37 are from Dang. The data doesn’t include those who returned after making it to the half-way or those who have been fighting the legal battle in the US for refugee status. But this data is enough to show that many such youths are from the ‘base areas’ of the Maoist insurgency.SSP Jeevan Shrestha, chief of the bureau, said that data on the number of such victims and the amounts they have spent is hard to collect since complaints are rarely filed with the police. “This is human trafficking but for a lack of law, we are still compelled to launch the cases as per Human Trafficking and Transportation (Control) Act 2074 BS,” Shrestha said. “The Act provides a maximum penalty of Rs250,000 for the offenders and 50 percent of that as compensation to the victims.” Without specific law, police also invoke the theft and organised crime act to punish the offenders, he added.On the one hand, police receive no complaints; on the other, the phenomenon sees no control.Bhaskar Gautam, a political scientist, says the rise in cases of human trafficking in the insurgency’s ‘base areas’ is due to the political system’s abject failure.While the Maoists raised issues related to livelihood, nationalism and a new kind of democracy to fuel their war machine, after the peace process, it is livelihoods that have been hit the hardest, Gautam said. “The traditional way of life and economy took a hit during the insurgency,” he said. “Developments after the peace process also failed to address that. What sprang up was organised human trafficking.”(Mahesh KC in Rukum East and Durgalal KC in Dang contributed to this report.)This report is prepared in collaboration with the Center for Investigative Journalism-Nepal. \nGyanumaya BK had been suffering from severe backaches for a while. The resident of Pokhara-15, BK visited the Metrocity Hospital in Srijanachowk seeking treatment five months ago. The 69-year-old, who works as a labourer, has already spent over Rs50,000 on follow-up checkups and medications.BK spent eight days in the hospital in January and has been paying off loans she had taken to pay her bills and for follow-up visits to the hospital. Had BK been aware of the Health Facility Operation Standards-2020, which private hospitals must adhere to, she wouldn’t have had to borrow money to pay her medical bills. As per the regulations, hospitals must set aside 10 percent of their total beds to the underprivileged and needy.“I didn’t know hospitals were required to provide free treatment to those who can’t afford hospital stays,” BK said. “But even if I did, I would have to fight to get the service as the hospital won’t willingly offer me the service.”The Pokhara-based 50-bed hospital’s Chief Executive Officer Gyan Prasad Aryal admits that his hospital does not adhere to the mandate. “We don’t have explicit information from the health ministry on the Health Facility Operation Standards-2020,” said Aryal. “Moving forward, we will follow the instructions.” The hospital authorities say they give a 10-15 percent discount on the final hospital bill as opposed to dedicating 10 percent of their beds and free treatment and medications to the less privileged. Hospitals with 15 beds come under the jurisdiction of the local units while those with up to 50 beds fall under the ambit of the Provincial Health Directorate. Likewise, the Provincial Health Ministry oversees health facilities with over 50 beds.However, no regulatory body has data on whether health facilities are following government rules, especially Health Facility Operation Standards-2020. But it is an open secret that most private hospitals in Pokhara are not following the regulations.Pokhara Municipality Health Department Officer Yadunath Baral, Kaski District Health Officer Bhim Prasad Poudel, and Province Health Director Khim Bahadur Khadka all admit that local hospitals disregard the regulations. “Our monitoring and inspection is also lax, that’s why most hospitals ignore the rules,” he said. He says lack of manpower hampers effective inspection. “Our manpower is enough to conduct inspections in other districts, but not in Kaski, which has many private hospitals,” he said. “We need more people for that”. According to Baral, although the hospitals claim to offer a certain discount on final bills to the needy, they are unable to show the record of the discounts provided. “The hospitals claim they give discounts, but most hospitals have not even been able to show us the proof,” said Khadka. “Legal actions should be taken against the hospitals that fail to submit a monthly report on the free services for the poor. More importantly, they must be liable for flouting government standards that aim to benefit the poor.” The Provincial Health Directorate also does not have any data on the directive’s implementation at hospitals with more than 50 beds.The department’s chief of health services Dr Ramesh KC says that they have been working on updating information of health services in the Gandaki region. “Hospitals have failed to submit their mandatory monthly reports. We will seek that information when they come for new permits or permit renewal,” KC said. There are 27 privately-owned hospitals within the Pokhara Metropolitan City and 39 in the Gandaki region. Bharatpur Metropolitan City in Chitwan in Bagmati Province is also called the ‘medical city’  as it is home to 23 private hospitals with a total of 1,200 beds. Additionally, there are multiple large-scale government hospitals and two medical colleges—Chitwan Medical College and College of Medical Sciences—that also provide medical services. Had the Health Facility Operation Standards-2020 been followed by the 23 private hospitals, 120 patients would have received free health services every year, according to Durgadutta Chapagain, chief of the Chitwan Health Office.“Although the hospitals claim they provide the services, none have been able to provide convincing proof. Instead, we found them giving such discounts to patients who are close to hospital operators,” said Chapagain. “Our department validates the permits for new health facilities and re-registrations for hospitals with a 25-bed capacity. We have asked such public health service providers to put up posters or stickers reading ‘Discounts for the needy’ on the hospital premises so that patients know what services they can get on discount.”Meanwhile, Bikram Adhikari, Secretary of the Private Hospitals Coordination Committee in Chitwan, claims that the regulations are impractical. “There are a few services that hospitals can provide free of cost. You cannot expect hospitals to provide all services for free. That’s why there is a need to amend the existing regulations,” said Adhikari.The monitoring bodies’ inaction and lackadaisical approach to ensuring that public health services are accessible and affordable to all makes private hospitals blatantly ignore government mandates.Bharatpur Metropolitan City’s Deputy Mayor Chitrasen Adhikari says that although the metropolis is aware that private hospitals must allocate 10 percent of their beds for free treatment of poor people, the metropolis administration has yet to devise a monitoring mechanism. “We have not taken any steps towards that end, but we will soon,” he said.Just like Pokhara and Chitwan, Biratnagar is also plagued with the same problem. There are 32 private hospitals currently in operation in the metropolis. Deepak Bhattarai, statistical officer at the municipality’s health office, asserts that none of the health facilities met the set requirements. A monthly report submitted by the Biratnagar-based Nobel Medical College and Teaching Hospital, which has 750 beds, stated that the hospital had provided the said concession to more than 400 patients. “However, the report did not clarify how many of the 400 patients were provided free hospital beds and the services that come along with the beds, and how many were given discounts on their hospital bills,” Bhattarai said. “We found that hospital reports also include concessions provided to patients who sought outpatient, emergency, and X-ray services.”The hospital’s director Narayan Dahal claims to be following all government instructions. He says 10 percent hospital beds are set aside for needy patients who are not charged any treatment fees, while 10 percent of service seekers also get discounts.Although the Biratnagar Metropolis has directed all health facilities under its jurisdiction to allocate free beds and provide free services to the needy, inform service seekers about the government-provided services, and submit a list of all patients who have received the services, the directive is ignored more often than followed. According to Bhattarai, medical establishments must get a letter from the local unit before making any upgrades or purchasing any equipment. “But the hospitals have been found presenting fake documents in order to acquire such permits,” he said. “The metropolis has refused such permits to 12 private hospitals in the current fiscal year.”Butwal Sub-Metropolitan City in the Lumbini Province has also taken no concrete step to ensure private hospitals adhere to Health Facility Operation Standards-2020. Despite having the authority to carry out inspections, the sub-metropolis’ apathy has deprived hundreds of needy patients of various government services. The sub-metropolis with 17 wards has more than two dozen big hospitals in the Butwal bazaar area itself. Not one of them adheres to the government’s health regulations. But the sub-metropolis is yet to monitor these hospitals. Yubraj Pandey, chief of Butwal Sub Metropolitan’s health department, says they have been unable to inspect medical institutes due to a lack of a proper set of rules.“I have just been transferred here. Discussions are underway to prepare legal requirements,” he said. Private hospitals in Butwal only began filing their reports two months ago after a joint meeting, informs Chief of the Sub Metropolitan’s Education and Health Department Mitramani Khanal. Twenty-year-old Suraj BK of Sarawal Rural Municipality-2 in West Nawalparasi got into a motorcycle accident on April 26. He suffered injuries on both his legs and was taken to Zenus Hospital and Research Centre in Butwal. Suraj was handed a bill of Rs 70,000 for treatment but he did not have the money to clear the bill and sought the hospital’s help. “The hospital refused to provide any discount. They in fact refused to discharge me. I got my discharge papers only four days later after I paid almost Rs 100,000,” he said. “I had to get a loan to pay the hospital bills as my father, who is a farmer, did not have that kind of money.”Dr Sharda Singh, the hospital director, said Suraj did not qualify for a discount as he did not have a recommendation letter from the local unit. “Patients have to get a recommendation to avail of free services at private hospitals but Suraj could not bring one,” she said. “I was in the hospital bed for four days. I could not have secured a recommendation from the local unit in that state,” said Suraj. Ishwari Prasad Chapagain, a civil society leader of Rupandehi and a member of the Consumer Interest Protection Forum, says private hospitals in Butwal are more interested in making money than helping those in need. “They do not follow government mandates. They act as if they have to bear the expenses of providing free service to the poor when in fact they get tax rebates and such for such services,” he said. “The sub-metropolis also does not do the needful. Everyone is corrupt including the city officials.”  \nThe duel between Kathmandu’s 34-year-old mayor Balendra Shaha (popularly called Balen), a structural engineer, reputed rapper and political novice, and 72-year-old Khagda Prasad Sharma Oli, a high school dropout, two-time prime minister, political veteran and chairperson of the Communist Party of Nepal (United Marxist Leninist) is a caricature of contemporary Nepali politics marred by the conflict between the old and the young. The duel has attracted numerous newspaper articles, set social media on fire and provided YouTubers a field day. What is Oli’s motive in mobilising his whole party to attack Balen, and what is Balen—a lone man with no political experience and political following—doing picking a fight with Oli? How will the duel impact Oli’s party and Balen’s aspirations going forward? The fightThe Balen-Oli fight began when the metropolitan city started to clear buildings built illegally on municipal land or business advertisements that did not comply with municipal regulations. The city would order the current occupants of the offending buildings or business owners to comply with the law and vacate the premises. In most cases, the occupants would ignore the order. Like in old times, they relied on their political connections to continue to subvert the law. However, that did not work with Balen. He sent municipal forces to demolish the encroachment and non-compliant adverts. The first property subjected to the mayor's action belonged to someone connected to the UML. Soon after the clearance, a Central Committee member of the UML, Mahesh Basnet, called upon his minions to physically harm Balen if he did not “mend his ways”.Balen’s attempt to clean up Kathmandu from squatters occupying public land, particularly river banks, intensified the conflict. Oli publicly mocked Balen for using bulldozers to demolish plastic shades built by “poor squatters.” Some “squatters” are believed to occupy multistory buildings constructed on public land and own businesses worth millions of rupees. The majority of them are UML voters, “UMLs’ vote bank”, observed a Balen supporter. The squatter problem is not new. All previous governments, including the one led by Oli, recognised it. The conflict became increasingly acrimonious when Balen opened the basement of Dharahara for car parking. The government objected, arguing that the reconstruction of Dharahara is still incomplete and the car park is unsafe to use. Balen retorted, “Dharahara was inaugurated as a completed project by Prime Minister Oli before the last election. How can it be incomplete?” The inauguration of the work-in-progress was one of Prime Minister Oli’s pre-election charades. The car park is safe and currently in use; the reconstruction continues. The recent New Road imbroglio added fuel to the fire. Balen started widening the footpath on New Road to comply with the standards set by the Nepal Department of Roads (NDR). A local ward chair, a UML member, objected and complained to the Ministry of Physical Infrastructure and Transport headed by Deputy Prime Minister Ragubhir Mahaseth, an Oli acolyte. The NDR, which reports to Mahaseth, issued a “stop work” order. Incensed, Balen asked Oli to expeditiously arrange repayment for those who cheated the so-called Giri Bandhu Tea Estate land plotting scandal. Oli’s apparatchiks compared Balen to “a puppy” (a good-for-nothing weakling) and chastised him for maligning “our respected Chairman”. Oli himself has described Balen as a “bubble” which will fizzle out in no time. The fightersOli is old, witty, foxy, prickly, intolerant of criticism and, like all other politicians, corrupt in the public eye. As enunciated during his premiership, his vision of economic development includes building view towers, providing Kathmandu households with piped gas within six months, and building facilities for maritime trade—the latter two unachievable pipe dreams or political ploys. Balen is young, angry, ambitious, audacious, brash, bold, impulsive, focussed and untainted by corruption. His vision for Kathmandu is to make it a clean, functioning, beautiful heritage city. In about two years since he became mayor, Kathmandu has become relatively cleaner and greener. Its roads are rid of perpetual potholes; its sidewalks are walkable; teaching standards in public schools have improved; private schools who were short-changing on paying taxes have been forced to pay their share; emergency ambulance service has become more dependable, and so on. All of the above, despite a lack of support from political parties and the government. Parties do not support him because his success will spotlight their past failures. Despite the odds, his accomplishments have made him hugely popular throughout the country. “If we have ten leaders like Balen, we can change the country,” an exuberant Kathmandu taxi driver told me. Even the international press has taken note of Balen’s leadership. The New York Times published a story on Balen last year. He was named one of the 100 upcoming leaders in 2023 by the internationally known Time Magazine, published in the US. Balen’s public support is so visceral that he gets away even with outrageous comments like “burning Singha Durbar’, Nepal’s central secretariat, the office of Nepal’s Ministries, and irrelevant dragging of Oli into the “Giri Bandhu Tea Estate” scandal, and other similar outbursts. Although the overwhelming support for such comments on social media is surprising, it is indicative of the intensity of public dislike of established politicians.The future Balen knows that he owes his popularity as much to his performance as his refusal to bow down to political pressure and to stay clean from corruption scandals. In the two years since he assumed office, he has given confidence to the city dwellers that with exemplary leadership, the city and the country can be changed. His future depends on whether he can continue to ignore political pressure and demonstrate his perseverance, will, guts and vision to turn chaotic Kathmandu into a livable metropolis. As for Oli, UML lost the last election in Kathmandu because its mayor, a UML member, was a dismal failure. The confrontation with Balen for political upmanship and ego inflation will unlikely win Kathmandu for him. Cooperation may work better than confrontation.    \nDespite the significance of public spaces in urban areas, Kathmandu Valley faces a scarcity of open public spaces, with irregular distribution and limited accessibility, leading to encroachment and compromised effectiveness due to unifunctional planning and ecological considerations.\nNepali art exhibitions held in May-June 2024 at Kathmandu’s major galleries represent the diversity of the idioms of Nepali paintings executed in traditional, ethnic and modern forms. Visiting the exhibitions, closely observing the artworks, and interacting with the curators and some artists, I realised that the quest for the right idioms to express the major motifs of paintings continues to be the main thrust of the artists. In this article, I am alluding to the genre of paintings exhibited in galleries. I have attempted to review the paintings displayed at the exhibitions and briefly discuss the diverse modalities and practices of exhibitions, as well as the impact of audience-oriented activism. Though I have been writing on the diverse genres and forms of Nepali art like sculpture, architecture and installation-oriented works mainly curated in Nepal by Sangeeta Thapa through major events under such rubrics as “biennale and triennale”, I have mostly produced reviews of paintings over the decades. I have put my review writings in catalogues and journals. In recent years, I have been writing articles on art for the academic journal Sirjana of the Sirjana College of Fine Arts. Navindra Man Rajbhandari, an artist, art teacher, curator, and pedagogue, has been working earnestly to edit and publish this journal. I visited the painting exhibitions in the major galleries—two at the Nepal Art Council, Babarmahal and one each at the Nepal Academy of Fine Arts and the Siddhartha Art Gallery. Interestingly, all these exhibitions are audience-oriented. The painting exhibition practice often follows the rituals of cataloguing the works with simple introductions and price tags written somewhat half-heartedly. They also mention the mediums used by the painters, like oil, water, gouache and, very commonly, acrylic. From the early artists who were exposed to Western art to those of contemporary times in Nepal, all use the same mediums as artists anywhere in the world. These mediums are the universal shapers of the idioms of paintings. Nepali painters use the above-mentioned mediums and other admixtures according to their modern training and indigenous painting traditions. The evolution of colour paintings, especially oil, marks the presence of the audience or the clientele of paintings; it has become a commonly recognised subject. All came through modern education in art. Artists’ emotions and the consonance of cultural and aesthetic factors are commonly represented in such paintings.One eloquent example was seen at an art exhibition, “Deities of Nepal II”, held at the Nepal Art Council in May-June 2024. This exhibition, principally curated by the art academic Swosti Rajbhandari Kayastha, presented some remarkable paintings and their projection modalities. The diversity of the paintings executed according to the overt and covert themes of sacrality had one common element. Their choice of colours and hues and their delineation to create the exquisite beauty of the mythopoetic figural of the characters in the paintings was one eloquent feature. Modern painters also treated the divine figures and their aura in their non-figural works. I especially liked the modern techniques in these paintings about the deities. The thrust was experimental. Some artists, comparatively, made very good paintings; others were just cliché works, naturally. However, the common strength and feature of all the paintings that featured the iconography was what the brief brochure text says: The composition of “the deities intricately woven into a tapestry of philosophical and spiritual beliefs.” The other was the search for an appropriate style for projecting the spiritual motifs. The paintings appeared to establish a covenant with the audience, this time through a pricing pattern. Paintings were liberally priced; some were priced up to Rs4 million. And the remarkable matter was that some of these expensive paintings were “sold” to Nepali buyers. We should remember that the paintings were sold as works of art, not as pictures of religious iconographies. The entry of the modern audience into Nepali paintings is what matters here. John Berger, a great art critic, says that the painting itself should generate the buyer’s desirability through its touchable and visual attraction. I saw this covenant at this exhibition. The next display was the “National Exhibition of Fine Arts 2024”. This one presents a different perspective in my collection several decades’ glossy catalogues of the Nepal Academy of Fine Arts. This exhibition, curated by Devendra Kumar Kafle, aka Thumkeli, its member secretary, and other departmental academy members, presents a unique view of Nepali art. Kafle guided me through the variety of artworks and described the collection methods. The collection is based on the modality of sampling artworks of Indigenous and regional features and bringing them out to the national exhibition, which is a remarkable activity. The Academy has published small glossy catalogues for them. In his note, the Chancellor of the Academy, Naradmani Hartumchali, says this is a culmination of such exhibitions in all seven states. He stresses the need to bring art to a level where indigenous forms could be made a topic of political significance by evoking such features as representation and social transformation. I don't know of any well-researched discussions on this important topic initiated by any authentic institutions. But the exhibition speaks for itself. The current exhibition, “Threads of Simultaneity”, organised by ‘Sirjana 2024’ and mainly curated by Navindra Man Rajbhandari, exhibits 200 pieces of artwork executed by 28 artists at the Arts Council. Artist Rajbhandari revealed that the exhibition was an attempt to project a historicity of a combined nature of art activity shared entirely by the academic cohort of the institution. The exhibition features some works of the erstwhile principals Sashi Shah (2001-11), Krishna Manandhar (2011-17) and Madan Chitrakar (2018-22), and members of the Sirjana College of Arts like Vatsa Gopal Vaidya and other senior artists associated with the college one way or the other. Works of the young and senior artists are on display. I also want to recall yet another unique exhibition organised by Siddhartha Art Gallery, “Sawari Kathaharu: Art in Motion”, in May 2024. The concept of motion in art is presented by creating the art of motion, as in Ralph Lily Turner’s “Storms”, Hokusai’s “Great Waves”, Pablo Picasso’s “Guernica” and Sashi Shah’s “Darting Horses”, to take a few examples. Capturing the fixed images mounted on darting objects like vehicles and exhibiting them in a reputed gallery is designed to showcase experimental works and their appeal.May and June 2024 were eventful in the realm of Nepali art. I was struck by the variety of motifs and styles that show the performative mode of Nepali paintings. \nIn yet another instance of the Nepali society failing to provide a safe space to women, a 16-year girl was raped in Panchadewal Binayak Municipality in Achham on Monday. The victim was staying in a chhau goth, or menstrual shed, at her maternal uncle’s home when she was violated by her distant relative. After years of awareness campaigns and the breaking of chhau sheds by central and local governments as well as non-governmental agencies, the victimisation of women remains a daily occurrence in several parts of Nepal, especially Karnali and Sudurpaschim provinces. The chhaupadi system was outlawed by the Supreme Court in 2005; in 2017, it was made punishable by up to three months in jail or a fine of Rs3,000 or both. But the inhumane practice remains deeply rooted in parts of Nepali society. While reports of extreme cases come from the hinterlands, menstrual taboo rules the roost even in the sophisticated drawing rooms and kitchens of urban centres. Impurity runs in the psyche of the average Nepali; menstrual blood simply oils the juggernaut of superstition, patriarchy and misogyny that is Nepali society.As disturbing as the news of the rape is the report that the victim’s relatives tried to conceal the incident. After all, this is a society whose so-called honour lies in the private parts of a woman. If it cannot save the woman from predators, it must hide the fact that it could not save the woman. From celebrating and defending rape-accused celebrities to punishing victims for speaking up, this society fails women each day. Just consider how unsafe this place is for women who have to suffer the indignity of chhau in this day and age. Cold, rain, wild animals, serpents or asphyxiation do not even come close to the danger they face from men. The tragic irony is that the woman who becomes “impure” or “untouchable” inside the home remains an object of desire inside the chhau shed. Consider how many cases of sexual assaults might have been brushed under the carpet in the name of family honour. Every night a woman has to spend in a chhau shed should count as the death of the conscience of Nepali society.Gauri Kumari Bayak and Amba Bohara and her two children were killed in 2018; Parbati Bogati and Parbati Budha were killed in 2019 in menstrual huts; and the list goes on, the tragedies returning each year. How many women must be raped and murdered before the society goes beyond the “shame” and “honour” dichotomy and considers women equal humans? How many seminars, constitutions and movements does it take for the state to be able to create a safe space for women? The society and the state must answer. Until it can guarantee safety and dignity to the women, the Nepali state might want to keep the national flag half-mast. After all, one-half of the flag belongs to the women, who make up half of the country's population.  \nThe Nepali cricket team is returning home today after a bittersweet performance at the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup 2024 in the US and the West Indies. But at the same time, it has sent an unmistakable message to the world: “We have arrived!”Nepal technically did not win any of the group stage matches at the world cup. The only point it got was through a draw with Sri Lanka after rain forced the match to be abandoned. The match with Sri Lanka was certainly the most anticipated considering how they were a relatively weaker team in the group and Nepal had a great chance of getting both the points. But Nepal was not out there looking for the weakest. Rather, it was there to take on the strongest cricketing giants. In the other three matches—against the Netherlands, South Africa and Bangladesh—Nepal gave its opponents ample evidence of its arrival on the global cricketing scene. The most electric performance, of course, was against South Africa when Nepal lost by just a run. But even in the narrow loss, it won plenty of hearts and accolades, having forced a top Test cricket-playing nation ranked third in one-day internationals and fifth in T20 internationals to run for its money. Neither could the Netherlands and Bangladesh take Nepal for granted. What was equally gratifying was the forceful presence of Nepali cricket fans cheering for Team Nepal. The Nepali fans did not only fill the stadiums from Texas to Florida to St. Vincent, they cheered on even as their team lost. This was not just due to a strengthening spirit of sportsmanship but also the confidence that we are rising and rising as a cricketing nation. At home, though, there is still a lot of work to do. The men in blue and red might want to work on their batting skills, for that is where we flattered the most this time. After assessing their World Cup odyssey, captain Rohit Paudel and coach Monty Desai will certainly sit down to work out a new plan of action, and we must have faith in their leadership—after all, Nepali cricket hasn’t been as consistently strong as it is under them. What we need immediately is investment in infrastructure. We do not even have a single stadium with floodlights, let alone proper stands and toilets for the spectators. The stadium in Kirtipur is rustic and amateurish at best; the one in Mulpani is taking ages to complete although it has been used for some tournaments; and the one in Bharatpur that has been partially built by the Dhurmus-Suntali Foundation has a long way to go before it comes into operation. Moreover, our players have limited exposure to even regional cricket although we live at the nervecentre of the cricketing world—South Asia. Nepal must take the initiative to invite regional cricketing powerhouses such as Afghanistan, Bangladesh, India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka for friendly and competitive matches so that our players get greater exposure. We have seen how Afghanistan has risen as the dark horse of cricket in just a few years with the right kind of regional support, mainly India. We stand to be the next big story in the cricketing world if we play our shots right.  \nWhile countries worldwide are forging ahead on an electric future, Nepal is still struggling to set clear plans and policies in the field. The government’s 10 percent tax hike on electric vehicles (EVs) for the fiscal year 2024-25 comes as a tight slap to the country’s commitment to EV-based mobility by 2030—at a time green transport systems across the country feel ever more important. For this or that reason, consumers here are obliged to line up for a whole day, if not days, to fill up their motor tanks. In a recent case, the underpaid fuel station workers halted fuel supply to private dealers and thronged the state-run stations in Kathmandu. These occurrences are here to stay, reminding us of the need to take the EV transition seriously. It is widely known that promoting EVs offers multiple benefits. The transition to electric vehicles in Nepal will not only reduce vehicular emissions and clean the air but also discourage the country’s overreliance on fossil fuels, which account for more than 17 percent of the total import bill. This shift, in turn, can help us leverage our under-tapped hydropower potential to build charging stations and export electricity to the two closest neighbours transitioning to green policies. EVs are costly to install, and concerns about insufficient charging stations in Nepal remain, but they are still more efficient and cost-effective than petrol or diesel vehicles. Nepal will also benefit from increased climate funds in the long run if we successfully make air breathable by cutting vehicular emissions through EV adoption. After all, Nepal must have a moral ground and track record of actions to negotiate for these funds and can’t always fall back on the excuse of the country’s negligible contribution to greenhouse gas emissions. What policymakers seem to be overlooking is the urgency of EV adoption. Their plans and policies on electric vehicles are ambiguous as, on the one hand, they pledge a green energy future while, on the other, they agree on building oil pipeline projects with India. Moreover, they always set ambitious goals and fail to achieve them. For instance, by introducing the Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC) in 2016, the government aimed to increase the share of EVs to 20 percent of all passenger vehicles; however, by 2020, only 1 percent were electric. Now, when people are more interested in buying these green wheels due to the tax cut on EVs last year, the new tax increment is bound to affect their choices. These developments are setbacks to meeting net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2045 and decarbonising the transport sector by 2030.It’s high time to come up with clear policies on green growth and execute interventions that wholeheartedly support electric vehicles. This includes installing charging stations and finding ways to sustain them by emulating international practices on repurposing, recycling and managing used batteries. Many organisations, donor agencies and development partners are extending their hand to Nepal in this effort. Failing to establish clear strategies and imposing tax restrictions could mean missing out on the benefits these agencies can provide and the overall change electric vehicles can bring to Nepal. The green energy goal is worth pursuing collectively, as no less than the future of humanity depends on it. Nepal as a responsible global actor must do its bit.  \nThe government’s recent decision to recall ambassadors, particularly Nepal’s envoy to India, just ahead of Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal’s visit to New Delhi, courted widespread controversy. What are the takeaways of the prime minister’s Delhi visit? What is the progress in implementing the trade and transit agreement signed with China and with the BRI projects? Thira Lal Bhusal of the Post sat down with Rupak Sapkota, foreign affairs advisor to the prime minister, for some insights.The government’s decision to recall ambassadors from 11 countries at once has come under heavy criticism. Why did the government take such a decision?In general, it has become a practice of sorts to recall incumbent ambassadors and appoint new ones after changes in the government or in the ruling coalition. This has both merits and demerits. The country’s foreign policy doesn’t change with a change in government. But every government and coalition has its specific policies, programmes and priorities. Therefore, even other countries make changes in political appointments as per the government’s priorities. Our case is a bit different. Ruling coalitions are frequently changed, and so are ambassadors. As there is a high chance of our politics being governed by coalitions given our electoral system, it has become necessary to establish a rational system on ambassadorial appointment. Either the political appointees themselves should voluntarily quit the job and return home just like vice-chair and members of the National Planning Commission do. Or there should be a consensus among major political forces to allow our ambassadors to serve out the full term.The second option of allowing ambassadors to serve out their term sounds better, doesn’t it?Definitely. Some initiatives have been taken with the objective of making our diplomatic appointments more prestigious, merit-based and better-managed. The government in 2019 introduced some criteria on ambassadorial appointments. We have to put more effort into ensuring that our ambassadorial appointees have the capacity to effectively carry out diplomatic duties. Once we establish a system of appointing envoys based on merit and not out of political biases, we can create a situation of allowing them to serve for the full term. Then, a change of coalition wouldn’t affect their continuity. We need to develop such a political consensus, given our geopolitical sensitivity.But the ambassadors appointed in recent years and their activities in host countries have lowered the bar of our diplomacy.We have seen rapid and huge changes in power equations in the world. In view of that, we can see some countries have appointed former ministers and even prime ministers as envoys to the countries with whom they have vital relations. They also appoint such personalities as envoys for a special mission. So, we have to think about ambassadorial appointments from different perspectives based on the changed context. It is high time that all the political forces and leaders agree on a basic point that those who have in-depth understanding and expertise of the field and can work for the best interest of the country will be appointed the country’s ambassadors. If the individual is competent, the person’s affiliation to a political party may not be a problem. But whether the person can work in the best interest of the country must be considered before appointment.But the government itself doesn’t seem serious about maintaining diplomatic decorum. For instance, the June 6 Cabinet meeting decided to recall the ambassador from India just days ahead of the prime minister’s New Delhi visit. There were also reports that the prime minister made the decision reluctantly due to pressure from coalition partners. What is the real story?It is nothing more than a coincidence. There were discussions about making changes in the ambassadorial positions in line with the March 4 changes in the ruling coalition. But it was deferred as the government needed to accomplish some important tasks and convene events such as the investment summit. When the government decided to change our ambassadors, it just happened to coincide with the prime minister’s visit to New Delhi to attend the swearing-in ceremony of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. It was a coincidence. Despite the decision, the ambassador had sufficient time to properly conclude all his engagements and duties there. The way he facilitated the process during the prime minister’s visit doesn’t reflect any misgivings about the government’s decision. So, it should be taken as a course that is in keeping with our tradition. In recent decades, other countries have given top priority to economic diplomacy, but the selection of our envoys and their activities doesn’t reflect that. Why aren’t we thinking in that direction?Yes, diplomacy in the past used to be one-dimensional, or it was conducted mainly by one particular ministry—the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. These days, many other ministries are engaged with international agencies. Economic diplomacy, labour diplomacy, climate diplomacy and security affairs have become crucial. We have to increase coordination, cooperation and collaboration among relevant agencies to make our international relations more fruitful and in line with the policies and goals set by our government.We have seen profound changes in terms of approaches, perspectives and dynamics of diplomacy in recent decades. All countries have started to give more importance to the competence of diplomats also in view of the increased geopolitical competition and rivalry seen between world powers. Rapid innovation in science and technology has not only eased our lives but also added challenges. We have to handle so many diplomatic engagements. Similarly, the number of international forums where we have to engage are increasing. These days, multilateral diplomacy and engagements have become as important. Even minilateral forums have started to play vital roles in international relations as the world powers have adopted multiple strategies to create their spheres of influence. In the meantime, the role of public diplomacy has become influential. So, a diplomat today must be dynamic and efficient enough to grasp the international situation, understand the sensitivity of the host country, articulate our country’s views efficiently and work in national interest. Therefore, it has become vital to be extra careful while selecting ambassadors.You talked about better coordination but we don’t see any correction in the practice of bypassing the foreign ministry while working with international agencies.Definitely, the foreign ministry is our focal point for all international relations conducted by a ministry or agency of our country. There should be no dispute about that. We need to make the foreign ministry more resourceful. Then, the ministry will have more capacity and efficiency to handle issues related to security, finance, labour and climate.Why have we failed to maintain reciprocity in terms of diplomats’ relations with the leaders of host countries? For example, our ambassadors in some capitals don’t get to meet the host leaders for years while the foreign envoys in Kathmandu can meet our prime minister and foreign minister directly and instantly.We have to see it from two perspectives. One is the power structure. In international relations, we can see the reflection of the asymmetric power relations between the big powers and other countries. The more developed and resourceful country’s influence in a host country can be seen and felt. Second, despite being an envoy from an underdeveloped or a small country, one can have diplomatic relations based on the principle of sovereign equality. It depends on the individual diplomat as well.In Kathmandu, we often err when dealing with foreign envoys. We have to decide what level of importance to give them. Therefore, some initiatives have been taken to correct and maintain consistency by implementing a diplomatic code of conduct that aims to integrate all activities through the foreign ministry. Foreign envoys will follow the system if we implement it consistently, irrespective of changes in the government. For that, there should be a political understanding at the national level.Let’s move to Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal’s recent India visit. Though it was mainly to attend the swearing-in ceremony of Indian Prime Minister Modi, he held some important political meetings. What are the takeaways from the visit?The visit was important from bilateral, regional and international perspectives. Traditionally, foreign affairs was described as an extended form of domestic affairs. But these days, international affairs have influence over domestic affairs as well. So such meetings and dialogues at the prime minister’s level are important. They exchanged views in a very cordial atmosphere. Of late, we have maintained bilateral dialogues at the political level on a regular basis and that has helped remove misunderstandings. Our prime minister’s emphasis is to hold bilateral dialogues both at the political as well as diplomatic levels in order to settle differences. India has taken this spirit positively.Second, the two prime ministers discussed how to expedite the implementation of the agreements reached between Nepal and India during Prime Minister Dahal’s official visit a year ago. The issue was discussed during the meeting between Prime Minister Dahal and Indian External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar as well. They also expressed satisfaction over progress in the implementation of bilateral agreements mainly in energy trade, connectivity and investment. In recent years, we have seen progress in investment, economic and trade sectors. Yet we still have some differences on border issues. That is an important and positive development in Nepal-India relations in recent years. In the past, when we had some differences on political, border or other issues, that used to badly affect other aspects of our relations. But now, both the countries agree to resolve outstanding issues through dialogue and our trade and all other affairs are moving ahead smoothly. This is the encouraging part of our relations. But border disputes can sour our relations anytime, right? Is there a sense of urgency to resolve it once and for all?The prime minister is for activating the concerned bilateral mechanisms to resolve such issues. He has also invited Indian Prime Minister Modi to visit Nepal. We can expect the Indian prime minister’s Nepal visit in near future. We can make some progress in resolving some outstanding matters such as border issues during the high level visit. I believe we will move ahead in this direction.Any progress on submitting the report of the Eminent Persons’ Group?During the meetings, the prime minister raised overall bilateral issues that include the matter related to the EPG report. I think once the mechanisms are activated and start working, that will create a situation for the report’s submission.Nepal and Bangladesh are completing homework for greater energy trade. India’s facilitation is a must for that. Is there any progress on securing the southern neighbour’s support for that?Progress in energy cooperation is a major achievement of this tenure of the prime minister. The progress is not limited to the bilateral level but goes to the regional level. A Cabinet committee of the Bangladesh government earlier this month approved a proposal to import 40 megawatts of electricity from Nepal. At present, we will use India’s infrastructure to export energy to Bangladesh. But for the long term there is a plan to build a dedicated transmission line for that. This shows it is not only Nepal that is interested in exporting its energy but other countries in this region are also interested in importing Nepal’s electricity. We have also signed an agreement to build a cross border transmission line with China. The doors are being opened for regional trade of our energy. This development will make India more open to importing energy from Nepal.Why are we failing to expedite projects under the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) of China?The economic cooperation between Nepal and China has substantially increased after we joined the BRI framework. So, Nepal has been benefitting from the BRI. We see some concern about the lack of progress on certain infrastructure projects to be built under the BRI framework. In fact, we are in a better position to implement the projects because now we can decide what kind of BRI projects are good for us based on the experience of project development and implementation under the BRI in other countries.We are working to finalise the BRI implementation agreement. Nepal wants to move ahead by signing the implementation agreement and developing the projects. Nepal joined the BRI framework based on its need to diversify trade and connect to the world market. The reality is the same now. So, we need to sign the implementation plan and move ahead as soon as possible. When I attended the Boao Forum a few months ago, I found the Chinese authorities and other stakeholders holding debates to build quality and resilient infrastructure. They also have plans to support the capacity enhancement of human resources and transfer technology in the BRI member countries.People mainly link the BRI with big infrastructure projects such as railway, road and transmission connectivity but there is no significant progress on these fronts. What are the roadblocks?In Nepal, no big infrastructure project has been completed on time, be it the Melamchi drinking project, airports, hydropower or road projects. We haven’t developed the capacity to build big projects, and we don’t envision any plan to operate after building it. So, not only with China but also with other countries and agencies, we have to seek support for small and medium-size projects that we can efficiently build and operate. Also, the third version of the BRI action plan has included building not only big but small and smart projects under the framework. We have to push for that. As we build our capacity, we can gradually take up big projects. For instance, now we can build big hydro projects on our own. It wasn’t the case until some years ago. We developed expertise in hydropower by building many small projects in the past few decades and gradually enhanced our capacity. We have already faced problems in operating the Pokhara and Bhairahawa airports. Is there any progress in taking Chinese support to operate the airports?We have to see both aspects—domestic as well as international use—of the airports. The two airports have helped us upgrade the quality of our domestic air travel as the passengers have benefited due to the upgraded infrastructure. The number of domestic passengers in these airports has increased significantly.It is true that there is no progress in terms of operating them as international airports. The government is studying all possibilities of their use based on their unique features. We are exploring various options in international markets to attract adventure tourists to Pokhara. Chinese stakeholders are also holding some promotional activities in Pokhara. Chinese authorities have told us that they are consulting with their provincial bodies and exploring possibilities to run regular flights to Pokhara. Similarly, the government is mobilising our embassies and other stakeholders in certain countries having a large number of Buddhist tourists to operate flights to Bhairahawa, and we have received some positive responses. I believe we will be able to operate regular international flights from these two airports soon.It’s been eight years since we signed the trade and transit agreement with China, which was touted as a historic deal between the two countries. Why haven’t we been able to implement it?Some symbolic steps have been taken in this period. For instance, a shipment was received from a third country [Vietnam] using a Chinese port in September last year. Similar other initiatives have been taken but these are limited to symbolic gestures. We have to prepare infrastructure and some legal basis to implement the agreements in a more result-oriented way. A bilateral meeting is being held this week. The meeting is likely to discuss how to bring the trade and transit protocol in an effective way. This meeting will discuss various issues faced so far and will also pave the way forward. We have also proposed to form a ministerial-level mechanism to oversee overall bilateral issues. The upcoming meeting will sort out various issues.The Chinese side was conducting a feasibility study of the Keirung-Kathmandu cross-border railway project. What is the progress?There is progress in various projects that we are carrying out with Chinese support. The cross-border railway feasibility study is in the final stage. Likewise, the study on the Chhahare-Tokha tunnel project is ongoing. A Chinese team is arriving to conduct a feasibility study of the Hilsa-Simkot road. A process to award a contract to build a friendly bridge at Hilsa with Chinese grants has begun. A foundation stone will be laid there soon. Also, a study to build the Chilime-Rashuwagadhi-Keirung 220kV cross-border transmission line is beginning soon. \nThe government has decided to make the National ID Card mandatory in order to receive services from government and public institutions. In the first phase, the June 6 Cabinet meeting made the National ID card number mandatory in 28 districts. People including federal lawmakers criticised the decision saying that it was enforced without first distributing the cards. In this context, Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal sat down with Yubaraj Katel, director general of the Department of National ID and Civil Registration.Let’s begin with a basic question. Why do we need a National ID card while we already have citizenship certificate, driving license, passport and voting card?There is a fundamental difference between a citizenship card and National ID. Citizenship establishes whether you are a citizen of the country and it helps you identify yourself with some basic details. In Nepal, it was also widely used as a service card. Wherever you go, you have to show the citizenship card—to open a bank account or acquire a SIM card for a phone. If we study international practices, there are mainly two cards—one is an identity card and the other is a service card. In 2018, the Nepal government came up with the idea of distributing national identity cards with a unique digital number for each eligible citizen. The number can track not only the individual but also the person’s activities and movements. This project has various components. First is data collection. It has two categories—demographic data, such as the names of father, mother and other family members. Second is biometric data—fingerprints, eye retina and digital signature. The biometric data is crucial to create a unique identity of each individual and avoid duplication in the integrated national database. The National ID has these two types of data. The other tasks are enrollment of the data, printing and distribution of the cards and then providing services based on that. At present, people carry multiple cards in their pockets. The objective of this project is to replace all of them by a single card–National ID. The new card includes vital details of all other cards in its chip with 1GB storage capacity. The government wanted to trace people based on their unique individual numbers so that there is no need to print and carry multiple cards. There is a huge industry of printing separate cards for each and every service that is creating a jumble of information. The National ID will not only replace multiple cards but also help authorities control criminal activities like financial frauds by removing duplication. At present, government authorities have difficulty in tracing and identifying an individual and wrongdoers are benefitting from that situation.What cards will be replaced by the National ID?It has a chip with 1GB storage capacity where you can store your driving license, academic documents, voting card, insurance details, ATM card number, etc. For instance, if you go to a telecom company to acquire a SIM card, they will ask for a copy of your citizenship card. You can say, ‘no, I have a National ID card’. Once you give your number and fingerprint, they can immediately verify it through the system. Another objective is to help people get rid of filling up pages of forms for each service. International governance has a norm that says don’t ask citizens their information more than once. A state agency should seek the information once and provide it to other state agencies if they require it. People complain that many agencies don’t accept National ID. They still ask for a citizenship card for official record and verification. So, in practice, it didn’t help people reduce the number of cards in their pockets. In fact, it added one more.Therefore, the June 6 Cabinet decision made the use of National ID cards compulsory in 28 districts. Now, it is going to be essential to get social security allowances, pensions and claim health insurance. The Health Insurance Board has said it has become challenging for them to verify whether a claimant is the rightful one. The board has 8 million policyholders. We will give them our details. Then, they can cross-check the authenticity of a claimant. This will help avoid huge financial frauds. In fact, the government should have made it mandatory earlier.But people including lawmakers in the federal parliament have strongly opposed the decision saying that the government made National ID mandatory without first distributing the cards to the people.Nepal’s total population is over 30 million. Our principal stakeholders are citizenship card holders. Those 16-year-olds are eligible for citizenship cards. The Election Commission distributes voting cards to those above 18 years. We got the data from the commission and added 20 percent and estimated that we have 18.6 people above 16 years old. As of Friday, we have already distributed the National ID numbers to 14.9 million people. Now, as per our estimate, around 3.7 million people are yet to get the National ID. Millions of people are abroad. Thus, we are headed towards saturation point in terms of data collection and issuance of the numbers. One thing I want to stress is that people don’t need a hard copy of the National ID card. The number is sufficient. Printing cards is costly. We have to pay around 2 euro to procure a blank card. The cost of printing, delivery and other overhead expenses is added to that. With the task of printing over a billion copies of ID cards being too costly, even India discourages use of hard copy of the cards. You can create the QR code of your card, save it in your mobile or print it in a paper and scan it wherever you need it.Officials at our government agencies bring up the rule that makes it mandatory to present a physical copy of citizenship card or other documents for official works.Yes, we are trained and habituated in that way. Now we need to change. We must make offices paperless while developing a strong database system. We have been using citizenship cards to verify the identity of a person for a long time. Biometrics not only helps identify people but also trace their activities. Recently, Rs2 billion was found in the bank accounts of a 26-year-old man. The money was deposited in 56 bank accounts. He used 13 ATM cards and 17 phone numbers. Once the National ID card is implemented, transactions and movements of such wrongdoers will be easily traced and monitored. Identifying individuals accurately is crucial to ensure good governance and strengthen security. Many people have acquired fake citizenship cards. People even made fake passports. Implementation of National ID will control it. It is also related to our national image. It will help improve the status of our passport and add authenticity to our other documents as well.Once the National ID comes into wide use, our details will be traced and used by multiple agencies. State agencies and other institutions benefit from the integrated database as they can easily trace us. But how do you ensure our data isn’t misused and it doesn’t make us insecure?If you have a National ID card, you don’t need a hard copy of your driving licence. There is a backlog of around 2.1 million licences. The government has failed to print and distribute them. We told them, we have already procured 12 million cards. Of them, 3.2 million cards have already been printed and we still need to print around 8 million cards. Once the licence data is integrated with the National ID card, it will be shown there. Now, to come to your question, only the traffic authority can access the licence-related data. The device they use will trace only relevant data. Only an authorised agency will get access to the data and it can’t be used for anything other than the stated purpose. We give access to agencies like Nepal Rastra Bank, Nepal Telecommunication Authority and Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal. Then they regulate the things in their domain. No unauthorised body or individual can access it. Do the implementing agencies have infrastructure to use this technology?We are in a position to implement it in some parts of the country. Therefore, we are implementing it in phases. We are making it mandatory for certain services in 28 districts from mid-July. We should have started much earlier. It must be expedited.Lawmakers said in a Parliament meeting that the decision has ‘terrorised people’ in the 28 districts as locals feared they might be deprived of the services as the government has made National ID cards mandatory without first distributing them.We started the National ID registration process from 2018. Registration teams reached in each local ward except in Mugu and Humla districts of Karnali. It was carried out as a campaign. Even after the drive’s completion, the registration process was open in all the 77 districts, 54 area administration offices and in palika (local unit) centres. We also had registration centres in major downtowns. We receive data of around 4,000 registrations a day. So, there has been sufficient initiative and enough time to encourage people to get the number. Besides, if anyone in the 28 districts are still to get the ID number, they still have three months to register.You said only an ID number but no hard copy was needed to access any kind of service, right?Exactly. There is no provision that states one should produce a hard copy to get any service. You give the number and your biometrics to verify that you are the right person. Then, the official can crosscheck it in the database within seconds.Do all the implementing agencies have the devices that read the National ID cards?We have distributed 4,200 machines that read the cards in 333 local units of the 28 districts. Likewise, we have asked other local units and districts and some agencies such as banks to procure the devices and we have given the specifications based on their requirements. A device costs just around Rs 1,500. You can enter the number and place your thumbprint on it. We have trained relevant officials from all the local units for the purpose.How many cards can the department print at present?We can produce 1,500 cards an hour. But now we are producing only 1,800 a day. We have the strength to distribute 30,000 cards a day but are distributing only 5,000 a day.Again the same question. Then why are people not getting the cards?There is some communication gap. People who registered in 2018 or 2019 haven’t contacted us. We are giving them priority to clear the backlogs. But people who are newly-registered are showing more interest. So, we need to strike the right balance.When will the department be in a position to distribute the cards to all the people?At present, we can print 100,000 cards a month. We have a space to double the capacity. Meanwhile, people have now shown more interest. By enhancing our facilities’ capacity, we can print the pending 8 million cards in the next 40 months.What about election cards? Do we need to register for that and get the voting cards?In fact, the Election Commission doesn’t need to collect data and issue cards. We will talk to them. As a constitutional body, we have to readily make the data available for them. In fact, the National ID Card system can help the commission make voting arrangements for the Nepalis abroad because it can accurately identify the right person and can immediately update the integrated system here in Nepal about the votes cast in any country. This card will be helpful in conducting fair elections because the biometric data stored in this system will be perfect bases to identify the people and instantly update the activities in the database.You have emphasised replacement of other cards by the National ID cards. How long may it take to do so?We plan on giving priority to three sectors—banking, civil aviation and telecom. People right now need to fill separate forms for these services that have irked the service seekers. We have asked the bankers to buy the devices. We as a supplier are ready. Now the stakeholders should be ready too. It will benefit them because it helps control frauds.What if I don’t register for the National ID card?In the first place, you will be deprived of social security funds, pension, insurance policies. Likewise, the government will gradually make the card compulsory to receive many other services such as driving licence, land transaction, telephone numbers, bank accounts. How do you assure that our data stored in this system isn’t misused?See, the current practices make you more vulnerable. Because multiple agencies take your data for various purposes. Do they have a system to protect the data and ensure that it isn’t misused? But when your data is stored only by a dedicated government agency, it will be more secure as the agency is specialised for that. When other authorised agencies seek data, we give them access only to the relevant one. We have a National Identity Management Information System (NIMIS). We have maintained three layers of security—L1, L2, L3—to ensure foolproof security of the data. There are three servers.Are we dependent on any foreign company for any related service?So far, only one international vendor is involved but we are cutting down its involvement as well, with a plan to ultimately replace it by our own agency. The vendor now helps transfer collected data to the printing machine through the Automated Biometric Identification System (ABIS). But our plan is to do so through our own government agency or local vendor. We do all the other tasks. Security printing is done within the office basement where every movement of people is monitored and recorded. \nPrithvi Subba Gurung, deputy general secretary of the CPN-UML, is one of the leaders who strongly lobbied for a federal system while the Constituent Assembly was writing the constitution between 2008 to 2015. Eight years after the adoption of the federal democratic republican constitution, the federal system, particularly the provinces, are widely being criticised for their supposed failure to deliver. The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal asks former Gandaki chief minister Gurung what went wrong in the course of implementing the federal system.The implementation of the federal system has faced several hurdles since its adoption. Most provinces have for months failed even to form the governments, let alone run them efficiently. Where is the problem?We have adopted a federal system but are working against its spirit. Provinces should run autonomously. On some key issues, federal leaders and the party’s central bodies may give some direction to their provincial bodies. But most provincial activities are still centrally-governed even years after the adoption of federalism. So, our practices aren’t in line with the system. The provincial governments shouldn’t have been affected by the changes in the federal coalition. Such problems were seen in India years ago. But they have learned from their experience. In our case, leaders of major political parties treated the provincial governments as party chapters. The provincial governments are formed and run as per the constitution and all the three tiers of the governments are autonomous. The high commands in our political parties aren’t ready to accept the new constitutional setup.Are the provincial leaders equally responsible as they seek Kathmandu’s nod before taking any important decisions?They seek the centre’s support because they are trained in that way. They are too dependent on the centre. You said India learned by experience and now provinces there work more autonomously. But, in Nepal, provinces are now witnessing more problems than during their first tenure, which is evident also in the difficulties in government formation in multiple provinces. Why couldn’t they learn from the five-year experience?Nepal’s leaders and political parties are still not committed to federalism. They have failed to implement the federal system as per the spirit of the constitution. This is the major problem. The big parties as well as their leaders are guided by a centralised mindset and still prefer working in a unitary system. We should not forget that we transformed the executive and legislative bodies into three tiers of federal systems. But our judiciary retained the old structure. Therefore, the judiciary doesn’t accept the federal system and its practice in a true sense. Its verdicts reflect the same.The role of Speakers and Province Heads has courted controversies in multiple provinces. The top court invalidated some of their decisions. Is it because of lack of clarity, faults in our constitutional provisions, or is it because of the leaders?Speaker and Province Head are political posts created in accordance with constitutional provisions. When overall politics is dirty and unhealthy, those taking up these responsibilities also feel compelled to resort to similar tactics. When overall politics improves, they automatically make better decisions. Mainly there is no leader in the high command who completely owns federalism and is determined to implement it in its true spirit. This government in its policies and programmes unveiled last month had rightly said that “protecting federalism and strengthening the federal democratic republic is our top priority”. But the budget failed to introduce programmes as per the promises made in the policies and programmes.How do we correct these anomalies? Where do we begin?We are in a complex situation. Many have started to float the idea of making amendments to the constitution. But we shouldn’t forget that various forces and stakeholders had their own positions during constitution-making. They made compromises and found middle grounds to promulgate the constitution. If we go for amendments, they all will return to their respective stances. Some may want to revive the Hindu Kingdom while others will stand against it. Some leaders even within Nepali Congress have started to advocate for constitutional monarchy. But we can’t regress to the monarchical system. We can’t renounce secularism and an inclusive democratic system. We can’t backtrack on our commitment to a socialism-oriented system. We may explore some changes in our electoral system or form of governance without going against these key features of our constitution but we can’t destabilise the charter. What are the major flaws to be fixed?There are some. For instance, provinces have no role in education. The responsibility of education up to secondary level is given to the local level. And, everything is controlled by the federal government. The local units are entrusted with key responsibilities such as developing curriculum, overseeing the issues of career developments of teachers and staffers and their promotion as well as transfers etcetera. Local units can’t do all of these things efficiently as they have their own limitations. How can a local unit transfer a teacher from Kaski to Lamjung? Provinces should have been given such responsibilities. The power has been centralised at Singha Durbar. Such is also the situation in other sectors.Though the proportional representation (PR) system is hailed as one of the most beautiful features of our constitution in terms of ensuring inclusion, it has also been blamed for political instability. Many have demanded revision in the electoral system.The major political parties such as the CPN-UML and Nepali Congress have not trained their party members on the proper implementation of key constitutional features such as federalism and electoral system. The party members and general people have either wrongly understood it, or have negative impressions about the systems. These systems were adopted with an objective to resolve our decade-long conflict and address the concerns of the historically marginalised communities and even mainstream some groups through an inclusive democratic system. The idea was to integrate all the communities and maintain unity in diversity. After holding years-long debates on various options, we agreed on the mixed electoral system so as to reflect our diversity in the state agencies.As the proverb goes, “the bad workman blames his tools”, our leaders are blaming the system for their failure to secure a majority by winning people’s trust. Many countries that practise similar electoral systems have progressed. Our electoral system and the form of governance are not causing political instability. Many countries have adopted a parliamentary system and many others have practised the presidential model. Countries have progressed in both the systems. Also, there are examples of failures under both setups. So, the problem lies in our political parties and leaders, not in the systems. Shouldn’t political parties like the UML and Congress work with a plan to secure a majority by winning people’s trust? They aren’t training their focus on that but blaming the system. At times, they have squandered the majority as well and have failed to keep the party intact. Isn’t it our [leaders’] failure?Some argue that the issue of the fractured mandate can be addressed by increasing the threshold ceiling for political parties to be eligible to get PR votes and that can be done by amending election laws. Does it help?This is the idea coming from big political parties because they get more votes when fringe parties disqualify for PR votes. But a higher ceiling may deprive many small parties from representing certain communities. So, this goes against the spirit of inclusion. What we need is a good coalition culture. If we see the trend of recent decades, Indian politicians have become much more mature in this context. In the past, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi accommodated his electoral alliance partners in his ruling coalition even though his party won the majority single-handedly. If we scrap the inclusive electoral system, won’t the marginalised communities again revolt? We should be careful about that.At times, leaders have helped dissident groups split their party. These are the same leaders who issued an ordinance to change the provision that required a group within a political party to show support of 40 percent members of the party’s central committee “and” the parliamentary party. Only then could it split. They changed the threshold to 20 percent, and the “and” provision had been changed to “or”. The provision of requiring 40 percent support on both sides had earlier been included to ensure political stability. But the leaders who are helping party divisions are blaming the system for instability in the country. So, we [leaders] have to mend our ways, not blame the system. The Rastriya Swantantra Party, the fourth-largest in the lower house, has officially said that it wants to overhaul the federal system and drastically downsize the provinces. Also, leaders within the major parties who earlier stood in favour of federalism have started criticising it. On Saturday, Congress General Secretary Gagan Thapa said the country can’t sustain the provinces in their present form. What is your view?I am one of those who advocated for a federal system even before the first Constituent Assembly because Nepal is a country full of discrimination based on caste, class, region and religion. We advocated for the system to do away with these discriminations and find a system to maintain unity within diversity. Federalism is the best system to promote national unity as all groups get their own space as per their unique features. For instance, if you make multiple rooms in a building, you can give space and adjust more people. But if you keep many people inside a big room, they will have difficulties—no matter how big the room is. We should strengthen the federal system. We can’t regress.Then, why do many people see provinces as a burden?In Nepal, the federal system was projected as a structure that resulted in huge liability to the state coffers. But the facts don’t substantiate it. A local unit in the federal structure replaced many erstwhile Village Development Committees (VDCs). For instance, in my home district of Lamjung, eight palikas covered the areas of 61 VDCs, and the expenditure of the current eight local units is no more than that of the erstwhile 61 VDCs. Now we don’t need 77 district coordination committees. They can be scrapped. No province needs more than seven ministers. Likewise, the federal Cabinet can be drastically downsized. Why do we need a 25-strong Cabinet at the centre when we already have seven other provincial cabinets? Twelve ministries are enough at the centre, as suggested by the high level commission on administration reform.There are many departments and divisions that were designed under the unitary system that have become completely redundant in the federal setup. So many project offices established over two decades ago based on the needs of that time are still there. These irrelevant bodies should be scrapped. This is how we can significantly cut down on administrative costs. Leaders and people don’t discuss that. They only blame provinces. \nLawmaker Jiban Pariyar, a joint general secretary of the Nepali Congress, the main opposition, was a member of the four-member taskforce that prepared the terms of reference (ToR) of the parliamentary committee to probe the cooperative scam. The taskforce finalised it after a prolonged dispute over whether to categorically mention Deputy Prime Minister and Home Minister Rabi Lamichhane’s name while defining the committee’s jurisdiction. The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal talked to him about the ToR finalisation process and other aspects of the probe. It took weeks to finalise the ToR and jurisdiction of the parliamentary committee formed to probe the cooperative scam. How did you finally reach an agreement? I will give a brief context first. Cases of cooperative frauds had been made public even in the past. But this time, some groups and gangs were seen to be working in an organised way to embezzle billions of rupees deposited by common people. Some established people, including those active in politics, were found to be misusing the people’s hard-earned money. This issue was thus urgent and our party Nepali Congress raised it strongly in Parliament. We had raised this issue even when we were in the government [before March 4]. We had raised it with erstwhile home minister Narayankaji Shrestha in parliamentary committees and other platforms. We had talked to him about the involvement of lawmakers and other politicians in such scams.But the Congress raised this issue more strongly after the party quit the government.This is true, and for a good reason. We demanded a parliamentary committee to probe this issue after our party’s exit from the government because Rabi Lamichhane, someone linked with some big cooperative scams, became home minister. We raised this issue after he was allowed to lead the same ministry and police agencies that were supposed to be investigating the scams. Earlier, various agencies within Nepal Police and other government bodies were looking into the matter. Erstwhile home minister Shrestha had assured us of an independent and fair investigation. Lamichhane transferred police officials who were investigating the scams, and tried to protect cooperative operators involved in wrongdoing. Based on all these activities, we concluded that a parliamentary probe committee is a must and we firmly stood for the same. Initially, we raised this issue in Parliament without obstructing House proceedings but the government compelled us to disrupt the meetings after it refused to address our concerns. The prime minister tried to give Lamichhane a clean chit by saying that he was not involved in the cooperative scams. Also, the Nepal Police chief at a parliamentary committee meeting said that the home minister wasn’t under investigation as he had done nothing wrong. In the meantime, the attorney general issued a letter stating that no cooperative-related case was registered against Lamichhane. It became clear that the government agencies wouldn’t investigate the issue independently. Then, we raised the issue strongly and we even had to obstruct Parliament meetings. After the pressure, top leaders from the ruling as well as opposition parties agreed to form a parliamentary committee to investigate the matter. The leaders formed a task force led by Law, Justice and Parliamentary Affairs Minister Padam Giri and entrusted us with preparing the committee’s ToR and defining its jurisdiction.But at the task force meetings, members from the ruling parties lobbied to define the committee’s jurisdiction in a way that only allowed for investigation into the wrongdoings of cooperatives and their operators but not those involved in syphoning money from there through illegal means. They argued that only those who issued the loans should be made liable, not those who obtained it. Their intent was to protect Rabi Lamichhane. But I insisted that our duty is to find where the common people’s money has been spent or misused and then to return the money to the depositors. I insisted on investigating Lamichhane as various studies have shown his involvement in the misuse of depositors’ money.Then, we started exchanging written proposals. We exchanged and discussed many such proposals in writing. We insisted on mentioning the names of Lamichhane and the Gorkha Media Network—where Lamichhane and GB Rai invested tens of millions of cooperatives’ money—and ensuring that the depositors get their money back. After a long negotiation, members from the UML became a bit flexible. But the Rastriya Swatantra Party of Lamichhane continued to be rigid. Then, we finally agreed to mention the names of the cooperatives from where Lamichhane and his former colleagues had obtained money and to name Gorkha Media Network but not Lamichhane.But won’t keeping out the name of the sitting home minister create more confusion and disputes?There is no need to be confused. The ToR has stated the name of Gorkha Media Network, where Lamichhane and his team invested the money they got from the cooperatives, and the ToR’s Annex-2 has a list of cooperatives from where they obtained the money. It has also stated that “responsible officials of the company” involved in such transactions would also be investigated. Even other firms and individuals linked to the transactions will be probed. So there is no chance of keeping Lamichhane away from investigation. The committee’s jurisdiction defined in the ToR is clear on this.Will your party ask for Lamichhane’s resignation after the committee starts investigating him?Our party is yet to formally demand the home minister’s resignation. But questions have been raised about him in Parliament, in various public platforms and in the media. Also, the general public has raised this issue. He knows the committee will summon him for interrogation. A few months ago, when a minister [from Congress] was summoned by the Commission for Investigation of Abuse of Authority, Lamichhane was the one who strongly demanded the minister’s resignation in Parliament. He will soon face the parliamentary inquiry committee. Let’s see how he faces it. Leaders from ruling parties including the prime minister have accused the Congress of personally targeting Lamichhane after he refused to join a Congress-led coalition in which he was offered the prime ministerial position.Leaders from new parties should understand that political leaders engage in dialogue with all political forces. Some meetings are convened in a strategic way. This is natural in a democracy. Also, Lamichhane met with our party president. But they spread a rumour that our party president offered him the prime ministerial position. That’s not true. The argument that we targeted him after he refused to join our coalition is baseless. The Congress has officially decided that the probe committee can investigate any of our members suspected of wrongdoings. Has any other party made such a decision officially? We have also officially challenged the home minister to prove the allegations he labelled at our party leaders from Parliament’s rostrum. We have also challenged him to investigate and prove the charges.When the names of head and members of the parliamentary probe committee became public, many thought that the parties didn’t give due importance to the panel as they nominated relatively low-profile lawmakers. Why didn’t the parties choose powerful leaders to investigate a national crisis of this magnitude?This is a wrong perception. All members are federal parliamentarians. They shouldn’t be judged based on their personalities and profiles. The committee is powerful because it has a mandate from the House, and its jurisdiction and the ToR give it power. What we should carefully follow is their work. They can invite experts and specialists—such as chartered accountants, bankers, account specialists—if they require technical expertise during the investigation.Lamichhane himself is chair of the fourth-largest party, which has a decisive role in the ruling coalition. Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal and CPN-UML chair KP Sharma Oli had initially ruled out any need of investigation into the home minister. In this context, can the committee members freely conduct the investigation?I am confident that even the committee member from the RSP can’t defend his leader when the documents and facts show that the money was illegally released. How can other members protect him? I believe they will conduct the investigation independently and come up with a consensus report. Documents, facts and figures guide investigation. This isn’t like leaders giving statements on public platforms. We are not saying he must be proven guilty as the Congress has blamed him. He may prove to be innocent after investigation. We should accept if the evidence proves Lamichhane innocent. The bottom line is that the investigation should be fair. Many Congress leaders are also involved in cooperative scams and other corruption cases. So people suspect that leaders will eventually trade off and the probe panel will be only an eyewash.This investigation cannot be weakened under any pretext. I am saying this based on the documents and evidence I have studied. Also, the media and other stakeholders such as the study report of Pokhara Metropolitan City and the investigation report of Rupandehi District Police, among others, have already made ample evidence public. It’s not easy to acquit the guilty.What will Congress’ approach be if the committee, where ruling parties have a majority, fails to decide by consensus and members take decisions on a majority basis?In the seven-member panel, there are two members from our party and one from the Rastriya Prajatantra Party. If those from the ruling parties pushed for a wrong decision based on their majority, members from opposition parties will counter that and register their differing views. If such a situation arises they will be free to make the reality public and they can even bring out a different report.Was Congress under pressure to reach an agreement as there were reports that the government was preparing to unveil the budget through ordinance citing opposition’s House obstruction?We weren’t worried about that. In fact, the prime minister’s initiatives and his seriousness to end the House deadlock played a crucial role in helping us reach this agreement. \nAmnesty International’s Secretary General Agnès Callamard was in Nepal last week as a part of her first South Asian tour. During her four-day visit, she interacted with people from all walks of life, including the prime minister, in an attempt to gauge the human rights situation here. In this interview with Binod Ghimire of the Post, Callamard talked about the human rights situation in Nepal and the rest of the world. Excerpts: You have been travelling this part of the world, interacting with people. How do you evaluate the human rights situation here?Human rights are backsliding everywhere. It’s a global phenomenon. There is backsliding on civil and political rights, freedom of expression, press freedom and freedom of peaceful assembly. There is backsliding on women’s rights and non-discrimination on economic rights, and in terms of armed conflicts. The number of people dying in armed conflicts is increasing exponentially. We are in deep trouble as far as human rights protection is concerned. The South Asia region hasn’t been immune to the global trend.For my mission, I am visiting Sri Lanka and Nepal. In the two countries, we observe the shrinking of civic space and greater weaponisation of laws to curtail freedom of expression, particularly online. The digital laws are often overbroad and disproportionate. Banning TikTok in Nepal, for instance, is a disproportionate overbroad measure of the violation of international laws. We are observing a great deal of attacks in protests. The use of lethal force or disproportionate use of force by the police in response to even peaceful protests is increasing. There are incidents where protestors have died after the use of police force. There are issues of impunity for past crimes. A study by a European research centre shows that fewer people live in democracies worldwide in 2024 than in 1986. This is a complete U-turn. What do you see as the reasons for the backsliding? There are several factors that explain the backsliding. One could be growing restlessness and anxiety due to economic downturns. There was a severe financial crisis in 2008, and we didn't really recover from it. The inequalities within states and between states have increased in the last decade. We have seen a sharp increase in the wealth of the super-rich. On the other hand, the poor are getting poorer. This is feeding anger and creating fertile ground for populism. The authoritarian leaders are feeding on that particular ground. The backsliding is also linked to Covid that had a terrible impact on the economy and society. During Covid, the governments adopted different emergency measures but, in many cases, those measures were never lifted. In Europe, refugees, migrants and minorities are viewed as the reasons why the economy is not picking up and they are accused of stealing jobs. In every country, the minorities have been made the scapegoats. There is a resentment that democracy has not delivered for the people. The expectations are high, but the governments have failed to act accordingly. Therefore, the people are prepared to listen to the authoritarian leaders. By authoritarian leaders, I do not mean those who are in power by force but those who are democratically elected. They are elected by the people, but they practise authoritarianism once they get into power. In Nepal, the burning problem of authoritarianism has been reflected even in local politics. For instance, the mayor of Kathmandu has resorted to repeated attacks against street vendors and landless people. These are authoritarian moves. Such leaders target vulnerable groups who cannot protect themselves. You are in Nepal at a time the government has arrested the owner of the largest media house. How does Amnesty International look at this situation?We are very alarmed and upset. We call on the government to release him immediately. Even if the charges are valid, they certainly do not justify imprisoning him. Amnesty International believes that the use of those charges is politically motivated and is an attempt to stifle dissent. It is a response to the professional investigation and reporting about the policies and practices of those in power. This is an attempt to silence him, to silence the news media and to silence journalists. By so doing, the authorities are also violating the rights of the Nepali society to access information at a time when they need that kind of information. The attack on Sirohiya is an act of reprisal, censorship and violation of his own rights and the right of the Nepali people to freedom of information and freedom of press, which is also a collective form of rights.We believe that he might have been arrested in relation to the reporting of financial fraud by people in power. Many people with whom I have interacted say that that safe space of expression is shrinking in Nepal. There are incidents where people have been arrested for criticising people in authority.Unregulated generative artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a big threat. How can it be regulated?Globally, information technology and AI present many opportunities for people. But they also present risks. Amnesty International has focused on the risks. We have identified discrimination and biases. Data upon which some of these AI tools are based are inherently biased. They are based on a sample of a certain group of people, which can not be the ground for effective policy making. We are campaigning against the use of AI for facial recognition for mass surveillance. It is a violation of the freedom of movement and freedom of privacy, and many communities around the world are disproportionately affected.We have done several studies that show that mass surveillance and facial recognition are used in the most impoverished African-American communities in the United States, Muslim communities in India and Palestinian communities in Israel and occupied territories. Cyber surveillance and spyware are other problems which have been widely used to target journalists and human rights defenders, as well as opponents. We have been demanding that spyware be regulated. So far, this has been excluded from different regulations related to information technology.Generative AI has huge implications for the world, societies and human beings. Currently, only the European Union has made attempts to regulate it by adopting an AI Act last December. This is imperfect but is a first step. We have criticised it because it excludes cyber surveillance and the use of AI for security purposes, and it doesn’t stop the use of AI targeted at refugees and migrants. Nevertheless, other aspects of the law are positive. Do you think other countries should follow the European Union’s footsteps?Yes, they can build on it without going below the benchmark. We encourage all countries to prepare and enact better laws. We are calling on governments to take it as an example, but after correcting the shortcomings.Why do you think Nepal’s transitional justice process has been stuck? What can human rights organisations like Amnesty do to push it forward?Sadly, the transitional justice process hasn’t progressed in several countries. I think the leaders are so keen to preserve the peace that they are prepared to give up on justice. They fear that if they open the gate to judicial reparation and investigation, what has been achieved so far will be dismantled. That’s the fear that I have seen everywhere. Everywhere, including in Nepal, the leaders create opposition between peace and justice.You can see many governments are opposing the International Criminal Court prosecutors’ arrest warrant in relation to Gaza, saying it will create problems in agreeing on a ceasefire. This is nonsense.Peace and justice are two sides of the same coin. In fact, peace is not sustainable without justice. When justice is not delivered, the conflict is bound to recur. It is just a matter of time. We often hear the excuse that if a particular leader or a person is prosecuted, that would affect peace. On the contrary, not investigating the perpetrator is a real challenge to peace. Many people who are in power after a peace deal themselves are guilty of war crimes. They don’t want to be held accountable. It is not in their interest to deliver transitional justice. It takes an incredible, highly moral and principled leadership to take the process ahead.We have seen here that the transitional justice process has been paralysed. Successive governments have failed to act on the Comprehensive Peace Accord. They haven’t acted on what the Supreme Court told them in 2015. It had directed them to review, revise and reform the Transitional Justice Act.Here I have seen the categorisation of crimes as serious and non-serious, which is very strange. It is shocking to me that some killings are considered non-serious, and could lead to de facto amnesty for those responsible for them, even though these crimes fall under international law. If someone was killed after torture then two crimes have been committed—torture and killing. Right to life is the most important right. The investigation should be done accordingly. The same is the case with sexual violence with rape and without rape.What is alarming is that people are losing trust. If people do not trust the systems that are supposed to deliver justice, that will cause a big problem. The Truth and Reconciliation Commission and the Commission of Investigation on Enforced Disappeared Persons couldn’t undertake proper investigation and prosecution. Not all have received the government’s relief, which has led to much frustration and animosity. There is political interference on transitional justice, which also lacks independence and transparency.We are calling on the authorities to act as directed by the Supreme Court, ratify the statute on the International Criminal Court as well as the International Convention on Disappearance. Do you see chances of international interference if Nepal continues to delay justice delivery?There is no doubt that some crimes committed during the war fall within universal jurisdiction. If the perpetrators of those crimes travel to countries where a framework of universal jurisdiction has been enacted, they could be arrested there. We are seeing the multiplication of universal jurisdiction cases in Europe.Cases of custodial deaths, torture and extrajudicial killings are common in Nepal. How can they be checked?Different organisations like Amnesty International should be monitoring the abuse of power by the police and state authorities. There must be impartial and fair investigation of such incidents. But there is a regime of impunity. The police are not very keen to investigate themselves. I wanted to mention the case of Ajit Mijar, which is an example of justice being denied. It also shows the complicity of the institution in denying justice.Nepal is ranked the fourth most vulnerable country due to climate change though it contributes negligibly in greenhouse gas emissions. The largest polluters haven't fulfilled their responsibilities towards Nepal. How can organisations like Amnesty advocate for countries like Nepal?Amnesty International has long been advocating for climate justice. We have a set of demands. We are advocating at the United Nations level and also at the COP. We are pushing through COP our message of loss and damage, about the responsibilities of industrialised countries to cut their reliance on fossil fuel industries and so on. The impact of global warming will lead to loss of lives in places like Nepal and Pacific Islands.We saw very timid steps taken in COP in UAE last year. These steps are far from sufficient. We see countries multiplying their investments in fossil fuel while big fossil fuel companies are also violating their written commitment to decrease the reliance on fossil fuels. This is alarming.However, we have made some progress on loss and damage. Governments are recognising the principle of loss and damage for the countries that are least responsible for climate change. They can rely on some kind of global financial system to protect and support them in case of a sudden climate related crisis. We are now advocating for the responsible countries to set aside the necessary funds.Nepal is at the receiving end of climate change though the country is not responsible for it. However, the Nepali government also has a responsibility towards its people. The extreme weather risk faced by Nepal demands urgent acts from the authorities. The most vulnerable communities are at particular risk. The government must have instruments to protect them.  \nToday, the weather will be partly to generally cloudy throughout the country.Koshi, Bagmati and Gandaki will likely experience heavy rainfall in the hilly regions.

Write it in the form of inspiring story not news article or event.\n    \n    Story:\nOnce upon a time, nestled between the towering peaks of the Himalayas and the lush jungles of the Terai, there was a country named Nepal. Though still a developing nation, Nepal was a land of profound beauty and deep-rooted cultural heritage. The residents of Nepal faced many challenges, but beneath these hardships lay a resilient spirit and an unyielding hope for the future.\n\nThis enchanting land, where Mount Everest reaches towards the skies and the air carries a mix of incense and cool mountain breezes, was more than a geographical marvel. It was a mosaic of cultures, languages, and traditions, a testament to human endeavor against all odds. Nepal's history, from the unification under King Prithvi Narayan Shah to its transformation into a federal democratic republic, told a story of aspiration and endurance.\n\nIn recent years, the people of Nepal, with their indomitable will, had taken strides towards rebuilding and reimagining their country. They turned their struggles into stepping stones, each challenge a chapter in their ongoing saga. The shift from a monarchy to a republic had not only changed governance but had woven a new tapestry of democratic values and collective decision-making.\n\nEconomically, while agriculture continued to sustain a large part of its population, Nepal had begun to harness the potential of its picturesque landscapes, developing sustainable tourism that promised to preserve their natural heritage while boosting local economies. Communities living in the shadows of the Himalayas had become stewards of the earth, protecting the biodiversity that made their country unique.\n\nEach day brought new stories. Whether it was a festival in Kathmandu, a technological advance in Pokhara, or a conservation effort in Chitwan, these events were threads in the vibrant quilt of Nepali life. These stories, updated daily, reflected the pulse of progress and the spirit of hope that characterized this resilient nation.\n\nAnd so, as Nepal moved forward, each moment was not just a passage of time but a promise of potential, a narrative of a nation perennially climbing towards tomorrow, guided by the legacy of its past and the dreams of its future.\n\nNews events:\nThe 16th Nepal-China diplomatic meeting focuses on BRI implementation plan signing, bilateral relations, and economic development corridors linking Nepal to Tibet, Sichuan, and Chongqing.\nCooperative victims resumed their protest in Kathmandu, demanding immediate implementation of past agreements and recovery of embezzled funds.\nOver 1,000 Nepalese have contracted various influenza viruses since January, raising concerns about undiagnosed cases and the need for increased surveillance and vaccination efforts.\nNepal's large cardamom traders urge government to negotiate duty reduction with Pakistan and Bangladesh for increased exports and market diversification beyond India.\nClimate change has led to the expansion of dangerous wildlife and diseases into previously unaffected regions, including mountainous areas, demanding an urgent adaptation of healthcare and disaster response systems.\nNepal's new alternative politics, despite promising a break from established norms, have neglected the issue of caste hierarchy and untouchability, failing to address the systemic discrimination faced by Dalits.\nPolarisation has become a widespread phenomenon in the last decade. The electoral victories of Narendra Modi in 2014, Donald Trump in 2016, Jair Bolsonaro in 2019 and the gradually emboldened far-right in Europe clearly suggest a crisis in liberal democracy. This phenomenon permeates global politics, threatening the current world order in the form of tumults, wars, recessions and a multitude of other crises. However, the interesting question is why polarisation benefits only rightists and not others.The United States will elect a new president by the end of this year. However, candidates from both the Democratic and Republican parties are old figures, and there is no excitement or expectation from them. Biden, 82, wants to retain the White House; Trump, 79, hopes to return. Since their policies have dominated US politics for the last decade, it is almost certain what Biden and Trump will do if either of them is reelected. Biden will continue his conventional and centrist policies, and Trump will bring rightist and fascist policies into the mainstream. The significant difference between them is that Trump is a more unpredictable and polarising figure than Biden.There are four major polarising agendas in US politics that benefit Trump. First, Americans have been deeply divided into Pro-Roe v. Wade and anti-Roe camps. Ostensibly, this issue is not that serious since it is merely about abortion rights. Still, its interpretation and implications take it into the core of the left and right political ideologies. Religion/Bible, ethics and individual rights have come to the centre of this debate.Second, US politics has been deeply polarised amid the unprecedented migration crisis. The US is known as a country of migrants. However, floods of refugees from the southern border have become a serious political issue. Biden seems to have failed to address this problem and instead buys the solution offered by Trump, i.e., building the wall on the southern border. Furthermore, whatever solutions he has brought will benefit him in the elections.Third, amid the long income stagnation, the meteoric rise of the wealth of a few individuals has engendered frustration, anger and dissatisfaction among voters. This has also caused disorientation in American society. Despite the Biden administration boasting of creating employment and taking control of inflation, people have felt no qualitative change in their lives. In fact, they blame Biden for not creating equal opportunities in health, education and housing. This widespread disenchantment is going to favour Trump in the upcoming election.Fourth, foreign policy is another crucial polarising factor in the US. Despite China's policy seeming to unite, the Israeli policy has divided the nation. Israel has metamorphosed into a fascist state under US patronage and the premiership of Benjamin Netanyahu, as it is committing genocide against Palestinians. After October 7, when Hamas-affiliated terrorists attacked Israel, there has been continuous bombardment, land invasion and indiscriminate killing of women and children. The US policy to provide military assistance and security guarantees to Israel has divided the US into two camps: pro-Palestine and pro-Israel. This polarisation has hurt the centrist Biden, while one camp of his supporters wants him to stop the war on Gaza. These supporters call themselves “non-committed”. This is also going to benefit Trump in the elections.Another front of this global polarisation is Europe. Far-right political parties have been emboldened. They do not shy away anymore from advocating their anti-migrant, racist and xenophobic agenda. The European Union's recent parliamentary election starkly demonstrates this polarisation. Marine Le Pen's party, National Rally, has become the biggest party representing France in the EU parliament, winning 32 percent of the votes. President Emmanuel Macron has called for a snap election due to the humiliating performance of his Party, Renaissance. However, this decision seems to have given the far-right the much-needed opportunity. Germany is not an exception. The performance of the centrist ruling Social Democratic Party of Germany and its coalition partners was poor, and the far-right Alternative for Germany is taking hold with 16 percent of the votes.India is another interesting case in which political polarisation is seen. Narendra Modi has become Prime Minister for a consecutive third term. His anti-minority, Hindu supremacist and majoritarian politics have not been defeated even after a decade-long experiment. His party, Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), won 240 seats in the recent elections, making it the single largest party in the parliament with 543 seats. As the largest party in the world, the BJP has influenced small South Asian nations toward communal politics. However, Modi's politics caused polarisation in the sub-continent as centrist space collapsed under his iron-fist rule.Polarisation helping the rightEuropean Green parties’ electoral loss is an interesting case of why rightists have exploited the space created by global polarisation. Despite the severe climate crisis, they performed poorly in the European parliamentary elections—all because of their ideological shortcomings. They must confront the widespread problems in Europe, i.e. income stagnation, class hierarchy, immigration crisis and war. Moreover, they cannot indulge in irrational politics by exploiting frustration and anger against the current global system. They cannot act irresponsibly, inhumanly and extra-judicially. They need to bring about ideological clarity or reason to create unity among the left-leaning mass, which is disgruntled by global capitalism. Unfortunately, they have failed to do so. Voters consider their so-called “green agenda” myopic, capitalist and insufficient as they failed to address serious issues. They could not offer any solutions for the migration crisis or the Ukraine war. They have offered no permanent solutions for the climate crisis and class discrimination, making them irrelevant in the eyes of voters. American and Indian left-leaning political parties have also faced the same problem. Left-leaning political parties fail to understand that global polarisation is the result of the crisis of capitalism. Their job to critique it is no longer a need but an option. European Green parties’ agendas, like electric vehicles against fossil fuel use to deal with the climate crisis, are ridiculously insufficient. They need to develop a systemic alternative where poor, wealthy, migrants, native, new and old generations all can find their space. For that, they need to offer an alternative way of life. Without this, their divide will remain intact, and rightist parties will hijack the space.  \nThe issue of jurisdiction that has cropped up in the parliamentary special committee formed to investigate crisis-ridden cooperatives across the country is nothing but a distraction to take the attention away from the main agenda. According to Sishir Khanal, a committee member from the Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP), it is unclear whether a committee formed by the federal Parliament can investigate the cooperatives that come under the jurisdiction of the provincial and local level governments. Khanal and the RSP are clearly fishing for a legal loophole to absolve the party chair and current deputy prime minister and home minister Rabi Lamichhane of the crime of routing money from various cooperatives into the Gorkha Media Network. There is documentary proof of money from at least four cooperatives being pumped into the network at a time Lamichhane was its managing director. Some of these cooperatives fall under the jurisdiction of the provincial governments. Khanal said the committee should work in a way that no legal questions can later be raised over its final recommendations. This is a flawed argument. A bit of context is warranted.The committee was formed after the main opposition, Nepali Congress, disrupted parliamentary proceedings for nearly two months, demanding that Home Minister Lamichhane’s involvement in the cooperative scam, particularly in relation to the Gorkha Media Network, be probed. After long negotiations, it was agreed that a parliamentary committee would indeed be formed and while the committee’s ToR would not mention Lamichhane, it would name the network. The fourth point of the committee’s ToR mentions that it will “study the status of the funds transferred to various organisations, including Gorkha Media Network Pvt Ltd, whether the funds were obtained legally or illegally, and how the funds were put to use will be conducted.” Legal experts the Post talked to were of the view that though many cooperatives may be operating under local or provincial laws, the federal government can regulate them, and as such the probe committee should have no problem in this regard. They point to the country’s constitution which gives the federal government the mandate to regulate all cooperatives.Here, we must again remember that the committee’s ToR mentions that all those entities from which funds have been transferred to the Gorkha Media Network will be probed. No distinction is made between the cooperatives that fall under the jurisdictions of various levels of government. Moreover, the committee had to be formed in order to meet the opposition’s central demand that the involvement of a sitting deputy prime minister and home minister in such an egregious crime be investigated. This is also why the name of the now-defunct media company he was once involved with is mentioned. As the seven-member probe committee has only three months, they should be working full time in determining those responsible for misappropriating hundreds of billions of rupees of common people. As a part of this process, the committee’s task will also be incomplete if it cannot either clear or implicate Lamichhane over the transfer of various cooperatives’ money into the accounts of a private media company. \nAfghanistan reached the semi-finals of the Twenty20 World Cup with a dramatic eight-run victory over Bangladesh under the Duckworth Lewis System in St Vincent on Monday, joining India as the qualifiers from Group 1 and sending Australia home.Bangladesh also had a chance to progress or send Australia through with a victory but the Afghans dismissed them for 105 to take the win they needed to set up a first World Cup semi-final against South Africa in Trinidad on Wednesday.Afghanistan hopes were dented when they were restricted to a modest 115-5 but skipper Rashid Khan took 4-23 and Naveen-ul-Haq 4-26 in a defiant bowling effort that delivered victory.The last few overs were high drama played out well past midnight local time with Bangladesh needing roughly a run a ball and the DLS calculations in case of more rain changing with every wicket and boundary.Naveen delivered the coup de grace in the penultimate over by bowling Taskin Ahmed and trapping Mustafizur Rahman in front off consecutive balls, triggering tearful celebrations from his team mates.India, who beat Australia by 24 runs earlier in St Lucia to leave the qualification hopes of the 2021 champions hanging by a thread, will take on title holders England in the second semi-final in Guyana on Thursday.Rashid won the toss and elected to bat first, sending out the same team that stunned Australia at the same Arnos Vale Ground on Saturday to give themselves a shot at the semis.Openers Rahmanullah Gurbaz and Ibrahim Zadran scored a third century partnership of the tournament to build the foundation for that upset and Bangladesh were desperate to separate them quickly.The Bangladesh bowlers made scoring mighty hard as they combined for 66 dot balls over the innings but they were unable to break the partnership until the 11th over when it was worth 59 runs.Rishad Hossain (3-26) did the damage by having Ibrahim caught on the offside for 18 and the leg spinner returned to remove Gurbaz for 43 as Afghanistan collapsed from 84-1 to 93-5 in 11 balls.Afghan skipper Rashid rallied with three sixes in his 10-ball 19 and was so desperate to score that he hurled his bat down the wicket at his batting partner Karim Janat in fury when refused a second run in the final over.After a brief rain delay, Bangladesh set off at a fair lick as they chased the win in 12.1 overs that they needed to get their run rate up.Left-arm seamer Fazalhaq Farooqi dismissed Tanzid Hasan lbw in the second over and Naveen removed Najmul Hossain Shanto and Shakib Al Hasan in successive balls before another shower swept in with the score at 31-3.Litton Das and Soumya Sarkar bumped the score up to 46-3 by the end of the powerplay but Rashid brought himself on and bowled the latter for 10 from his fourth delivery.Rashid came back on to dismiss Towhid Hridoy (14), captain Najmul Hossain Shanto and Hossain, the latter two in successive balls to reduce Bangladesh to 80-7 just before another shower forced the players off again.Bangladesh’s target was reduced to 114 in 19 overs after the break but their hopes of reaching the semi-finals were now gone, though opener Litton Das stood firm even as his batting partners departed in the late drama to score 54 not out. \nWikiLeaks founder Julian Assange is due to plead guilty this week to violating US espionage law, in a deal that will end his imprisonment in Britain and allow him to return home to Australia, ending a 14-year legal odyssey.Assange, 52, has agreed to plead guilty to a single criminal count of conspiring to obtain and disclose classified US national defence documents, according to filings in the US District Court for the Northern Mariana Islands.He is due to be sentenced to 62 months of time already served at a hearing on the island of Saipan at 9am local time on Wednesday (2300 GMT Tuesday).Assange left Belmarsh prison in the UK on Monday before being bailed by the UK High Court and boarding a flight that afternoon, Wikileaks said in a statement posted on social media platform X.“This is the result of a global campaign that spanned grass-roots organisers, press freedom campaigners, legislators and leaders from across the political spectrum, all the way to the United Nations,” the statement said.A video posted on X by Wikileaks showed Assange dressed in a blue shirt and jeans signing a document before boarding a private jet with the markings of charter firm VistaJet.He will return to Australia after the hearing, the Wikileaks statement added, referring to the hearing in Saipan.“Julian is free!!!!” his wife, Stella Assange, said in a post on X.“Words cannot express our immense gratitude to YOU - yes YOU, who have all mobilised for years and years to make this come true.”The only VistaJet plane that departed Stansted on Monday afternoon was headed to Bangkok, FlightRadar24 data shows. A spokesperson for Assange in Australia declined to comment on his flight plans. VistaJet did not immediately respond to a request for comment.The Australian government, led by Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, has been pressing for Assange’s release but declined to comment on the legal proceedings as they were ongoing.“Prime Minister Albanese has been clear - Mr Assange’s case has dragged on for too long and there is nothing to be gained by his continued incarceration,” a government spokesperson said.A lawyer for Assange did not immediately respond to a request for comment.HISTORIC CHARGESWikiLeaks in 2010 released hundreds of thousands of classified US military documents on Washington’s wars in Afghanistan and Iraq - the largest security breaches of their kind in US military history - along with swaths of diplomatic cables.Assange was indicted during former President Donald Trump’s administration over WikiLeaks’ mass release of secret US documents, which were leaked by Chelsea Manning, a former US military intelligence analyst who was also prosecuted under the Espionage Act.The trove of more than 700,000 documents included diplomatic cables and battlefield accounts such as a 2007 video of a US Apache helicopter firing at suspected insurgents in Iraq, killing a dozen people including two Reuters news staff. That video was released in 2010.The charges against Assange sparked outrage among his many global supporters who have long argued that Assange as the publisher of Wikileaks should not face charges typically used against federal government employees who steal or leak information.Many press freedom advocates have argued that criminally charging Assange represents a threat to free speech.“A plea deal would avert the worst-case scenario for press freedom, but this deal contemplates that Assange will have served five years in prison for activities that journalists engage in every day,” said Jameel Jaffer, executive director of free speech organisation Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University.“It will cast a long shadow over the most important kinds of journalism, not just in this country but around the world.”LONG ODYSSEYAssange was first arrested in Britain in 2010 on a European arrest warrant after Swedish authorities said they wanted to question him over sex-crime allegations that were later dropped. He fled to Ecuador’s embassy, where he remained for seven years, to avoid extradition to Sweden.He was dragged out of the embassy in 2019 and jailed for skipping bail. He has been in London's Belmarsh top security jail ever since, from where he has for almost five years been fighting extradition to the United States.Those five years of confinement are similar to the sentence imposed on Reality Winner, an Air Force veteran and former intelligence contractor, who was sentenced to 63 months after she removed classified materials and mailed them to a news outlet.While in Belmarsh Assange married his partner Stella with whom he had two children while he was holed up in the Ecuadorean embassy. \nBrazil missed a string of chances and were left to rue a lack of quality in the final third after they were held 0-0 by Costa Rica in their Copa America Group D opener in Los Angeles on Monday.Brazil, who came into the Copa America on the back of a run of poor results in recent months, dominated possession but lacked precision in front of goal with just three of their 19 shots on target.“Now it’s about being honest with ourselves, creating alternatives to create chances, scoring, results are important in this competition, points left at the beginning can complicate things at the end,” Brazil defender Marquinhos said.They were frustrated by a resolute five-man Costa Rican defence, who looked to contain their opponents and deprive them of space. The strategy paid dividends even if Gustavo Alfaro’s side rode their luck at times.Raphinha had an excellent early opportunity to score after latching onto a long ball over the top from Rodrygo, but Costa Rica keeper Patrick Sequeira came quickly off his line to snuff out the danger.Brazil thought they had got the breakthrough in the 30th minute when a free kick was flicked on by Rodrygo into the path of Marquinhos, who poked it in at the far post but the goal was disallowed for offside after a lengthy VAR delay.The one-way traffic continued after the break and Lucas Paqueta rattled the woodwork with a long-range effort in the 63rd minute before a venomous Guilherme Arana strike was kept out by a fine save from Sequeira.Coach Dorival Junior brought on youngsters Endrick and Savio in the 70th minute as Brazil desperately sought a winner but Paqueta twice shot wide in the final 10 minutes as the nine-times champions failed to break the deadlock.“We played a great game, we fought until the end, I had three chances myself, we were frustrated not to win, but we left with confidence, we fought,” Paqueta said.“We played our game, we have to improve our finishing, myself in particular and other players, so that we can win.”Brazil’s all-time leading scorer Neymar, who has been sidelined by an anterior cruciate ligament injury, cut a dejected figure as he looked on from the stands.Colombia lead Group D following their 2-1 win over Paraguay earlier on Monday. \nThe weather today will be partly to generally cloudy throughout the country.There are chances of heavy rainfall at one or two places of the Koshi, Madhesh, Bagmati and Gandaki provinces while light to moderate rain with thunder and lightning is likely to occur across the country.Tonight, Koshi, Bagmati, Lumbini and Gandaki provinces will be mostly cloudy while the weather will remain partly to generally cloudy in the rest of the provinces.Stay indoors and keep your umbrellas close as heavy rainfall is likely to continue at one or two places in Koshi, Madhesh, Bagmati and Gandaki provinces. The rest of the country may also experience light to moderate rain with thunder and lightning tonight.On Monday, the maximum temperature of Nepalgunj rose to 40.4 degrees Celsius while Jomsom recorded a minimum temperature of 15.5 degrees Celsius. \nMattia Zaccagni rescued Italy with a 98th-minute equaliser as the defending champions booked their spot in Euro 2024’s last 16 on Monday with a 1-1 draw in a tense game against Croatia, whose tournament hopes are hanging by a thread.Luka Modric gave Croatia a 55th-minute lead, moments after missing a penalty, and that looked like sending them through before late substitute Zaccagni bent a stunning finish past the despairing dive of Dominik Livakovic into the far corner.The result left Italy, who next face Switzerland, second in Group B on four points, with Croatia third and waiting to see whether two points will be enough to take them through to the knockout stage as one of the best four third-placed sides.“We deserved to go through tonight in terms of what we produced out there,” Italy coach Luciano Spalletti said. “It was hard to make it through this group. Spain are brilliant, Croatia are excellent.”Spain, who topped the standings, beat Albania 1-0 to finish with a perfect record from their three games and leave the eliminated Albanians rock bottom with one point.Albania’s loss also propelled sides not in action into the last 16 with England, France and the Netherlands now guaranteed to finish at least among the four best third-placed teams.Italy had been rocked with defeat by Spain, which could have been more emphatic than the 1-0 scoreline, yet if there was some solace for Spalletti’s side heading into Monday’s match it was that Croatia had been even less impressive at the finals.The Croats’ 3-0 loss to Spain and 2-2 draw with Albania had left them on the precipice and one of the main issues that had dogged them at the tournament - how to turn possession into a goal threat - re-emerged in the first half against Italy.Croatia barely gave the Italians a kick for most of the first 20 minutes but it was not surprising that they only had Luka Sucic’s long range pile-driver, which was parried over by Gianluigi Donnarumma, to show for their efforts.Italy looked far more purposeful with Mateo Retegui having a couple of half chances before Alessandro Bastoni had the best opportunity of the first half, meeting Nicolo Barella’s lofted ball to the far post with a header saved by Dominik Livakovic.RELENTLESS NOISECroatia’s fans provided an extraordinary backdrop to the opening 45 minutes with their relentless noise, flares and an ear-piercing firecracker, but it wasn’t until after the break that their team started to repay them for their efforts.The second half was only minutes old when Croatia were awarded a penalty. Andrej Kramaric’s shot struck the outstretched arm of halftime substitute Davide Frattesi and while referee Danny Makkelie waved play-on the VAR sent him to have a look at the screen and he swiftly changed his mind.Modric stepped up to take the spot kick but his effort was saved brilliantly by Donnarumma low to the keeper’s left, although it was only a momentary reprieve for Italy.Seconds later, Croatia’s halftime substitute Ante Budimir’s header drew another superb save from Donnarumma but Modric was on hand to gobble up the rebound, which he fired into the roof of the net to atone for his penalty miss.That made Modric the oldest scorer in the tournament’s history at 38 years and 289 days, but there was to be no lasting celebration for the Croatia captain.Italy pushed hard for a route back into the game and substitute Gianluca Scamacca was inches away from connecting with a cross in the 87th minute.However, with Croatia’s fans starting to celebrate what they thought would be a victory, Italy struck a devastating late blow.“Football was merciless with us tonight, it was cruel,” Modric said. “It is hard when you lose like this to describe how you feel. The football gods don’t always smile on us.” \nMaximilian Araujo, Darwin Nunez and Matias Vina scored as Uruguay beat Panama 3-1 in their Copa America Group C match in Florida on Sunday.Uruguay’s win saw them move level with the United States on three points. The U.S. beat Bolivia 2-0 in the day’s other Group C match.Marcelo Bielsa’s Uruguay, who have won the Copa America a joint record 15 times, were rewarded for their blistering early pace when Araujo fired home a sublime curling effort from the edge of the area in the 16th minute.Panama grew into the match after the break and wasted several chances to get themselves back into the contest.Jose Fajardo blasted an effort wide in the 52nd minute after a defensive error by Mathias Olivera, while Jose Rodriguez tested Uruguay goalkeeper Sergio Rochet with a ferocious shot from range.Asked what he said to his team at halftime, Panama coach Thomas Christiansen told reporters: “I told them they have to be fearless.“That they have to increase their level of confidence. That they are capable to do what they did in the second half. And after the goal, like Uruguay, we generated opportunities.”Uruguay were on the ropes for much of the second half but Nunez, who had already missed a string of chances, settled their nerves in the 85th minute with a coolly-taken volley into the bottom corner after a rebound dropped kindly for him.In a frenetic spell during stoppage time, Vina rose highest to head home Uruguay’s third from a set-piece before Michael Amir Murillo netted a consolation goal for Panama after cutting back onto his left foot and curling his shot past Rochet.Uruguay’s all-time leading scorer Luis Suarez, 37, was an unused sub.Uruguay next face Bolivia in New Jersey on Thursday, while Panama take on the United States in Atlanta. \nThe government on Monday decided to transfer suspended chief secretary Baikuntha Aryal, who has been chargesheeted in a corruption case, to the National Planning Commission.A Cabinet meeting took the decision to create a special position at the commission and transfer Aryal to the post, said Minister for Information and Communication Technology Rekha Sharma, who is also the government’s spokesperson.“Aryal was automatically suspended from his position as per the existing law after the Commission for Investigation of Abuse of Authority (CIAA) filed a case against him at the Special Court,” Sharma said. “For now, it has been decided to create a special position at the National Planning Commission of a hierarchy similar to that of his current position and transfer him there.”According to Sharma, the special position will exist as long as Aryal remains there and it will automatically be dissolved with his exit.The CIAA on Sunday filed a Rs386.7 million corruption case against a company and 11 individuals, including Aryal, at the Special Court over their alleged involvement in irregularities while awarding a contract to print excise duty stickers.In the history of Nepal’s civil service, this is the first time a corruption case has been filed against a sitting chief secretary and subsequently suspended. \nThe Supreme Court on Monday stayed the CPN (Maoist Centre)’s decision to take action against Gandaki provincial assembly member Phanindra Devkota.A single bench of Justice Prakash Man Singh Raut issued an order allowing Devkota to continue working as a lawmaker.“Official documents show that Devkota is associated with the Nepal Samajbadi Party. It does not appear that the petitioner quit the said party, nor does it seem that the petitioner was expelled by the party. The action by the CPN (Maoist Centre), the party with which Devkota is not associated with, is not justified as per the constitutional and legal provisions,” the court said in its order.“An interim order has been issued to the defendants not to implement the action until a final verdict since it appears that irreparable damage will be caused to the petitioner by not being able to perform the role in the capacity of a people’s representative.”Devkota, a minister in Gandaki Province government, was relieved of his position as a member of the provincial assembly on June 14. Speaker Krishna Prasad Dhital removed him as a lawmaker based on the recommendation of the CPN (Maoist Centre), which decided to take action claiming that he had defied the party whip.Devkota, a leader of the Nepal Samajbadi Party who fought the 2022 election under the Maoist Centre’s symbol, had voted in favour of Chief Minister Surendra Raj Pandey of the Nepali Congress. Devkota’s vote was a must for Pandey to win the Assembly’s trust.The Maoist Centre parliamentary party had issued a whip for its members to vote against Pandey. Devkota, however, defied the whip, arguing that the Maoist Centre’s instruction did not apply to him because he comes from a different party.In November 2022 general elections, the Baburam Bhattarai-led Nepal Samajbadi Party had forged an electoral alliance and used the Maoist Centre’s election symbol. \nThe advocates for justice for victims of conflict-related sexual violence (CRSV) have objected to the decision by local governments to start registration of such victims, questioning its legality and assurance of confidentiality.Following directives from the Ministry of Home Affairs, a number of local governments have started collecting applications from the victims of conflict-related sexual violence.The applications have been called from women and girls who faced sexual violence at the hands of state security forces and then Maoist rebels, but whose cases are missing from the state’s records of victims. Since the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) is the authorised body to collect the complaints, advocates for the victims doubt the legitimacy of the applications solicited by the local governments. “What will be the legality of the applications? Will they be recognised by the TRC? As far as I know, the TRC will not accept them,” said Devi Khadka, coordinator of the National Association of Conflict Rape Victims, a network of CRSV victims.The government issued a circular to the local governments to collect the applications with the primary objective of providing relief and compensation to the insurgency-era victims of rape and sexual assault. The state continues to neglect such victims. Neither have they been recognised by the state nor have they received any relief from the government. As many as 63,718 complaints have been registered with the TRC. However, only 314, less than half a percent of the total, are related to rape and sexual violence. Very few victims lodged complaints as they were not convinced that their records would be kept confidential, according to Khadka. “We are not convinced that the local governments can maintain confidentiality. Unlike other victims, they cannot come out on the open because of the social stigma associated,” she said. “Most victims of rape and sexual violence haven’t revealed their ordeals even to their husbands and close family members. Doing so means breaking their families.”If Khadka’s claim is anything to go by, seven insurgency-era victims of rape and sexual violence from a local unit in the Sudurpaschim Province are in trouble as it could not keep their secrets. The representatives at the local level, however, say they are working to support the victims as per the federal government’s circular. “Some 35 victims have applied at our municipality. We are serious about maintaining their confidentiality,” Tilakram Lamsal, mayor at Thakurbaba Municipality in Bardiya, told the Post. He, however, said he was unaware whether the TRC or the federal government will recognise the applications they have collected.Officials at the home ministry also say they are not sure about the legality of the complaints. Radha Kumari Shrestha, an officer with the Peace Promotion Department at the Ministry of Home Affairs, said they got the circular to register the victims for their documentation and to provide relief and reparations. “I am not sure whether the TRC will own up the applications,” she told the Post, adding that respective local governments are responsible for maintaining confidentiality.Through the national budget the federal government has announced plans to create a peace fund of Rs1 billion to provide compensation and financial support to conflict victims. Similarly, different local governments also have allocated budgets to support conflict victims including the CRSV. After months-long discussions, cross-party lawmakers have agreed to allow three months for the registration of the complaints by the victims who missed out on doing so in the past. The victims say the government and parties should prioritise endorsing the amendment bill to the Enforced Disappearances Enquiry, Truth and Reconciliation Commission Act, which will formally open the doors for the TRC to receive the complaints.Laxmi Pokharel, a human rights lawyer with the International Court of Jurists, said the idea of allowing the local governments to keep records of victims is not wrong. However, there are no proper mechanisms at the local units to safely keep the records of the victims of rape and sexual violence. “There is no uniformity among the local governments in providing relief. While some are working actively, several others are doing nothing. This is leading to disparity,” she told the Post. “The federal government should formulate a uniform policy in providing relief, one that will be applicable across the country.”Currently, the Khadka-led organisation has been continuously working to screen the physical and mental health of CRSV victims. A recent medical test conducted among 38 rape victims from the Maoist insurgency showed 11 of them had cancer. Similarly, an additional eight need immediate surgery to remove their uterus. “Further tests are being conducted to ascertain the stage of their cancer. This is very serious,” said Khadka. In the medical tests conducted in December last year, an overwhelming 70 percent of the 127 victims had one or more reproductive health-related complications. The health condition of five of them was bad enough to need regular tests and treatment.  \nThe Nepal-India relationship is complex, wide-ranging and deep, making it difficult to fathom. That is why, despite a long apprenticeship in bilateral relations, I consider myself a novice on the subject. Sometimes, our limited knowledge creates misunderstanding and distrust even if the relationship remains intact. For the past 60 years or so, some people have tried to define the Nepal-India relationship in their own emotional ways but have failed to make any dent without India’s wish. Their concern is understandable when seen from the perspective of broad principles of sovereign equality, territorial integrity and peaceful coexistence, forgetting that inter-state relations are guided more by pragmatism than principles. For any country, national interest is supreme while conducting foreign policies. Most politicians and intellectuals driven by emotions forget that the conditions surrounding them are more deterministic than their feelings. Here comes the question of geo-politics, geo-economics and geo-strategic contexts.The Nepal-India relationship since the Treaty of Sugauli continues to define both limitations of powers and the relationship pattern. Even if some minor adjustments or changes occur, the substance and nature of bilateral relations remain the same. For some Nepalis, symbols matter more than substance, which is vital for conducting bilateral ties. Even then, both countries do not deviate from the main course of the unchanged relationship. India, too, has not departed from conventional policy by trying to operate within the same parameters as the old rulers. Even if the situation and context changed, the basics of the relationship remain the same.India does not like to disturb the structure of the relationship, relating it to its larger national security issue. It seems that even in the future, apart from some minor adjustments, it is unlikely to be drastically altered. Indians think opening the 1950 Treaty is like opening the “pandora’s box” and, hence, needs to be cautiously handled. Without being on the firm ground of reality, Nepalis will experience more woes. Knowing the implications and given the limited strategic autonomy, King Mahendra, apparently a die-hard nationalist, also didn’t raise the issue of the 1950 treaty. Still, policy measures adopted by the royal government and India have led to the erosion of some treaty provisions. Coming close on the heels of the continuity of the relationship, the former foreign secretary and Indian ambassador to Nepal, Shyam Saran, said at a talk programme recently, “There will be more continuity than departure in India’s foreign policy in coming days–in rhetoric and style”. Then what alternative approach can Nepal take? I think focusing on the country’s development, projection of good governance and image by showing the ability to prosper and make people confident should be the strategy. If all-round development takes place by raising people's life standards, national confidence and maturity would grow, eventually leading to better cooperation with the immediate neighbours. The status of a nation is not raised by too much politicisation of relationships, as we have been witnessing for over six decades. Nor is foreign policy conducted through an emotional approach alone. Some developmental activities and formal and informal channels used by both sides to sort out immediate problems arising from time to time can measure how the two countries have stabilised bilateral relations and cooperative endeavours since the 1950s. Regime changes have not at all affected the continuity of the developmental process. Today, the development pace is faster than before. The political environment, irrespective of governments, is favourable, as parties and leaders seem to have understood the significance of development despite their subjective views on various issues. Now, Nepal and India have reached an understanding of purchasing 10000 megawatts of electricity by India and facilitating Nepal’s use of the Indian corridor for power sale to Bangladesh. Since Nepal and India are two separate nations politically and historically, civilisational commonalities do not always work when the question of nation-state arises. Therefore, it is natural that some divergent approaches to events and developments are noticed not to the extent of damaging the structure and dynamics of bilateral relationships. Some issues are perceived differently by the elites of the two countries. For example, some patches of the border often trigger controversy. The two governments have claimed that 97 percent of the border problem will be solved if both sides officially agree. But Nepal is not prepared to agree unless other disputed territories such as Sushta, Kalapanri-Lipulekh and Limpiadhura are settled. Sushta’s problem could have been settled long ago as it is not serious from an Indian security point of view. The Kalapani issue is complex because India considers it settled, but it contrasts with Nepal’s claim that goes far beyond the existing border. Since the newly adopted map called chuche naksa (pointed map) that shows the border up to Limpiadhura has already been passed by the Nepali Parliament by a two-thirds majority after reaching some sort of national consensus, it has become more complex. India reacted to Nepal’s action as a unilateral “cartographic assertion”, adding that the lands claimed by Nepal belong to India. The issue has become more complicated because of the long Indian rule (bhogchalan) and Nepal’s new claim as its territory. In addition to such complex issues, minor problems such as waterlogging in some parts of the Tarai, inundation, floods and trade deficit reduction are nagging. However, the issue of balance of trade entirely lies with Nepal’s capacity to enhance production and make Nepali products market-worthy in India and elsewhere. Only then can Nepal expect India’s cooperation to facilitate Nepali products to enter the Indian market. Mutual trust and confidence on both sides are essential to resolve ensuing differences, big or small. Moreover, perception, rather than reality, gives grounds for distrust. India should not be too suspicious of Nepal’s relations with China and other Western powers, especially the US, as it is armed with leverage over Nepal because, even if it wishes, the latter cannot cross the Rubicon due to various compulsions.   \nThe day I met Rima (name changed), it was already late morning and she was anxious. There were around seven women in a small room. She rocked nervously and reiterated that she did not want to talk. We told her she did not have to. An hour later, we could not stop her from telling her story.Rima’s body was like a battleground in itself. It was 2001: Peace talks between the government and the then rebels had just failed. Nepal Army officials came to Rima’s house and arrested her. She was kept in captivity and repeatedly raped for 14 months by army personnel. She was only 14 at the time. She told her story in minute detail: How her limbs swelled up after being tied up, how the sounds of boots made her heart thump and how the men stomped on her breasts with those boots. She was stoic in her storytelling. Everyone almost forgot to breathe. But what upsets Rima now is not only her past. Like many other women in the world who were sexually abused in conflict, Rima faced social ostracism once the war ended, and twisted versions of social morality and patriarchy won once again. Rima tried to live with dignity. Rima’s quiet storytelling broke into loud sobs when she started talking about her children. Her inability to give them a decent life broke her resolve. Her strength in times of great vulnerability is what breaks my heart. This meeting was in 2021, when we were still in the uncertain stages of shooting our film, Devi. I was with Devi Khadka, our protagonist, a survivor of sexual violence in Nepal’s decade-long conflict. At the time, Devi was still quite unsure about what she could do with other victims like herself, but she wanted to investigate. We had followed her journey and found ourselves in a room of forgotten women: Girls and women who had been sexually abused and raped during Nepal’s conflict. But their existence, while cursorily accepted by the state, had been effectively erased from Nepal’s history.Devi Khadka’s story had haunted me for years. I’d read about her in the newspapers, shocked at some of the commentary, unable to grasp the callousness of it. Khadka was arrested, tortured and raped in custody by Nepal Police personnel in 1997. She was made to tell her story to the press by the Maoist Party after she was released in 1998. A well-known ‘feminist’ columnist wrote a piece in the Nepali Patra weekly in defence of the police, questioning the veracity of the then seventeen-year-old traumatised girl.It took years for Devi to trust the press, and I am humbled that she trusted me to tell her story. It took four more years of telling me her story, listening back to versions of her own story, and analysing it that helped her sharpen her vision. The very act of telling one's story can give the storyteller agency. When Devi first talked to me, she was a district leader of the Maoist party, haunted by the loss of her brother, Rit Bahadur, during the conflict. Like an automaton, she fulfilled the role of a Maoist cadre, telling herself that the party was as loyal to her as she was to the party. But as she met more victims, the change in her was palpable. For those who have not seen this change, it’s easy to dismiss Devi Khadka on so many grounds: Devi can barely understand English, the language of the world of development. She has had only one day of formal education, after all. But she can, in her mother tongue, give an eloquent expression of how wartime sexual violence survivors in Nepal can be addressed. She is doing her undergraduate studies, totally self-taught, and she pours through legal documents and policy papers, catching details that escape many. She can stand on stage, tell her story and move people to action. And she can be sharp. When someone asked her if she can handle budgets as a non-English speaker, she calmly replied, “I’ve managed ministries. Of course I can handle it. If you are asking if I can handle your language, I can always get hired help.” Yet, some from Nepal’s transitional justice community have been unforgiving of Devi, calling her “political” and disingenuous. However, this is hardly a time for pettiness.My job as a filmmaker has allowed me to examine Devi. I’ve seen the trauma that wartime rape has left her with and the struggle she still undergoes to overcome the demons left behind by it. But it is the story of many Rimas, raped by the state forces or violated by the Maoists, and forsaken by both, that has shaken Devi to the core. Once committed, she’s been steadfast. With very little support, she has built a network of survivors, lobbied with the government and other development actors, worked with human rights activists, and has added to the work of many others who have fought for justice to make a tangible impact on Nepal’s transitional justice process. The amended Transitional Justice bill, currently in Parliament, has, for the first time, included wartime sexual violence survivors and opened ways for them to get reparations and justice. Perhaps a better way to understand Devi today is as a human rights activist with political acumen. Storytelling is an act of resistance. It was for Devi but for me as well—a way of expressing solidarity to all the women who have suffered sexual violence during the war (and in peacetime). For every year that Nepal’s transitional justice process remains incomplete, women like Rima will keep suffering while perpetrators remain free. The wounds of the likes of Rima have not healed. For now, Nepal’s wartime rape survivors have some hope with this bill. Devi Khadka, with other survivors, will push on. With the other players in the field who are schooled in the language and the world of development, welcoming Devi as an equal player—not a victim any more, but a leader—will strengthen the cause.Shrestha is a filmmaker and a journalist.

Keep your heads high,” world cricket governing body International Cricket Council wrote on X, formerly Twitter.South Africa legend Dale Steyn called the Nepal vs South Africa game the “Match of the Tournament” on ICC’s Digital Daily show.“It would’ve been the talk of the tournament if Nepal would’ve gotten over the line. It would’ve been fantastic, and they deserved to win,” Steyn said. “[This was] the match of the tournament to be honest with you. I saw people crying in the stands, it shows how much it means to them, and that’s what cricket is all about.”Indian cricket commentator and journalist Harsha Bhogle said Nepal have a brighter future ahead of them.“Hold your heads high Nepal. That was South Africa you almost took down today. You have some of the most passionate fans and you let them believe. Hopefully bigger days are round the corner.”Indian Premier League franchise cricket team Chennai Super Kings wrote on X: “Unreal fans support! Unreal game of unreal night! Nepal, you have won all our hearts!”“Nepal's performance—all cricketing commentators, most of the IPL franchise teams, cricketing bodies are talking about the team, talking about that fan following!” a Nepal supporter based in Australia wrote on X. “Isn't it great? Didn't we win something?”ICC and Asian Cricket Council commentator Mikkhail Vaswani wrote on his Facebook page: “Nepal are the youngest team in this World Cup. They have put on some great performances. Time to back the boys for a very strong and committed effort.”At an average age of 23.7, Nepal are the youngest team at the World Cup. The team is led by Rohit Paudel, who, at 21, is the youngest captain in the 20-team tournament, while Gulsan Jha, 18, is the youngest player.After the match, Paudel stressed that Nepal needed more exposure against the best teams of the world if they are to be on the right side of the result.“We were very close but a little far,” Paudel said after the close contest. “In crunch moments, we did well, the way we fought was very good.”He added, “If we get more exposure regularly, then next games we will be on the other side [of the result].”Nepal were a far less experienced side as they were making their only second appearance at the world stage.Chasing, the batters took Nepal to 85-2 in the 14th over in the chase, riding on 32 runs from their power play without losing a wicket and a half-century stand between opener Aasif Sheikh and Anil Sah that came off just 36 deliveries.But the introduction of spinner Tabraiz Shamsi (4-19) would prove to be lethal in Nepal’s chase.Shamsi first dismissed Bhurtel for 13 with his only second delivery in the eighth over and Paudel for a duck two balls later to hurl South Africa back in the game.Sheikh and Sah rebuilt the Nepal innings.Sah hit three boundaries off Anrich Nortje and a six off Shamshi to raise the tempo before Sheikh smashed Kagiso Rabada for a four and a six that took Nepal past 80 total after 13 overs with still eight wickets in hand.After Sah fell to Aiden Markram (1-8) making 27 runs off 24 balls, Sheikh and Airee dragged Nepal to 98-3 from 17 overs.But Shamshi returned with the ball in the 18th over and mercilessly raided the stumps of Airee and dangerman Sheikh to turn the game back into South Africa’s favour. Sheikh finished his innings with 42 runs off 49 balls.Nepal needed 16 runs off the last 12 balls but Nortje (1-27) and Ottneil Baartman held their nerves in the final two overs to save the Proteas from the jaws of defeat.Nortje bowled four dots in the penultimate over including a wicket of Kushal Malla that left Nepal requiring 16 runs off the last eight balls.Sompal Kami hit Nortje with a long six and collected two runs off the last ball of the 19th over that brought the equation down to eight off the final six deliveries. Gulsan Jha next cracked a four off Baartman in the 19.3 overs and managed another two off the next delivery to inch Nepal closer to overhauling the target.Nepal only needed two runs off the last two deliveries to keep alive their hopes of reaching the Super Eight but Baartman threw two dots with perfect bouncers to break Nepali hearts.Gulsan Jha tried to take the game to Super Over with a desperate attempt to add a run off a bye of the final delivery but Quinton de Kock and Heinrich Klaasen combined to run him out at the non-striker’s end.Earlier, Bhurtel took 4-19 and Airee bowled 3-21 to trouble South Africa throughout the innings.South Africa added 22 runs for the first wicket before Airee got the breakthrough wicket when he caught and bowled de Kock for 10 in the fourth over.Bhurtel then bowled captain Markram for 15 in the 12th over, ending their 46-run stand for the second wicket.South Africa seemed headed for a good total when they were at 68-2 in the 12th over but Bhurtel’s wrist spin and Airee’s off break kept their powerful opponents under control.Bhurtel removed Klaasen for three before Airee got the big fish Hendricks, who top scored for South Africa with 43 runs off 49 balls, and removed David Miller for seven the next.South Africa needed sixth number batter Tristan Stubbs’s 27 not out off 18 balls for a boost to their innings.Bhurtel then underlined Nepal’s impressive bowling, claiming the wickets of Marco Jansen (1) and Rabada (0) in successive deliveries off the final two balls.Sandeep Lamichhane also started for the first time after missing Nepal’s matches in the United States due to visa issues and bowled splendidly conceding only 18 runs in his four-over spell.“I am very proud of the unit, especially the way we bowled and batted, I'm very proud of that,” Paudel said.South Africa skipper Markram was also full of praise for Nepal’s bowling.“First and foremost, the way [Nepal] bowled it made it really tough for us. They put us under a lot of pressure,” Markram said.The defeat leaves Nepal fourth in the five-team group D with one point, which they earned after rain washed out their second group match against Sri Lanka. Nepal had lost their opening game to the Netherlands by six wickets.South Africa, who had already progressed to the Super Eight round, finished the group stage unbeaten, collecting eight points from four matches.Nepal next face Bangladesh on Monday and will look to end their T20 World Cup campaign on a high note.Bangladesh are second with four points from three matches and a victory over Nepal would secure them a spot in the next round.The Netherlands, on two points, are also in contention and next face Sri Lanka who are also without a win and lie at the bottom of the group. \nThe process of enacting a separate air carriers’ liability and insurance legislation for domestic carriers has stalled yet again.On March 1, the Cabinet approved the tourism ministry’s proposal to prepare a draft bill on domestic air carriers’ liability and insurance.This was done years after Nepal adopted the Montreal Convention of 1999, which makes international airlines liable in case of death or injury to passengers. Nepal adopted the Montreal Convention of 1999 on December 15, 2018.The tourism ministry officials say that the process stalled this time after Buddhi Sagar Lamichhane, the chairman of the panel appointed to prepare the draft bill, was automatically suspended on April 5. This happened after the Commission for Investigation of Abuse of Authority filed a case against 32 individuals, including Lamichhane, at the Special Court over their alleged involvement in corruption in the April 2017 Airbus A330s deal.Mukesh Dangol, an official at the tourism ministry, said the ministry has appointed Indu Ghimire, its joint-secretary, to head the panel. “With this latest development, the process will now move ahead.”He said that after a round of consultation with the stakeholders, the draft will be sent to the finance and law ministries seeking their consent. “Following their nod, the draft will be tabled at the Cabinet before it is registered in Parliament.” The draft, however, is already ready. Officials expect the registration process to be completed in at least two months.The draft of the air carriers’ liability and insurance bill from domestic carriers, which proposes a five-fold increase in compensation for death or injury, has been in the making since Nepal ratified the Montreal Convention.The draft bill was extensively discussed with the stakeholders before it was finalised in 2020.However, successive tourism ministers failed to table the bill in Parliament. The draft bill was then kept on hold without much explanation.The long-delayed air carriers’ liability and insurance draft bill proposes a fivefold increase in compensation for death or injury.As per the planned law, domestic airlines have to pay a minimum compensation of $100,000 for the injury or death of a passenger. Currently, the minimum compensation for passenger death on a domestic flight is $20,000.Under the Montreal Convention of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), carriers have to pay 128,821 Special Drawing Rights (SDRs) or ($171,018) if the damage is due to the carrier’s negligence or a wrongful act or omission.SDRs are an interest-bearing international reserve asset used by the International Monetary Fund.Under the Montreal Convention 1999, in any crash, the victims’ families have the right to claim unlimited compensation if there is a wrongful death.The draft bill says that the carrier should make an advance payment when it is necessary to meet the immediate economic needs of passengers or the families of victims.According to the proposed law, a compensation claim should be filed with the airline or its agents within 60 days of the incident or accident. The carrier’s liability limitation for cargo lost, damaged or delayed shall be $20 per kg if the damage was caused or contributed to by the negligence of the carriers, it says.Under the Montreal Convention 1999, effective as of December 28, 2019, a carrier’s liability limitation for cargo lost, damaged or delayed shall be 22 SDRs per kg ($29.21 per kg) in the case of destruction, loss, damage or delay concerning cargo carriage.Similarly, carriers must pay 1,288 SDRs ($1,709.90) for each passenger in case of baggage destruction, loss, damage, or delay.Likewise, 5,346 SDRs ($7,097.16) should be compensated for each passenger in relation to damage caused by delay in the carriage of persons.The domestic carriers, however, have been objecting to a few clauses, such as the carrier’s liability for delays and unlimited compensation, which, according to them, is not practical in a country like Nepal.Airlines officials say that, given Nepal’s geographical terrain, climatic behaviour, and airport facilities, Nepali airlines cannot afford to be liable for delays.According to tourism ministry officials, the proposed legislation is a modified version of the Montreal Convention 1999 as there are several clauses that domestic airlines would not be able to comply with.Frequent ministerial changes have slowed it down, they say. Some ministers held their positions for long enough but were not bothered about pushing the bill.The bill could not be registered as Parliament was prorogued several times in the past.As a result of the delay, passengers who died in the Yeti Airlines plane crash in January 2023 missed out on compensation in millions of rupees.The Yeti Airlines tragedy in Pokhara was Nepal’s 104th crash and the third biggest in terms of casualties.According to Nepal’s civil aviation body, more than 900 people have died in air crashes in the country since the first disaster was recorded in August 1955.The biggest air accident took place on September 28, 1992, when an Airbus A310 belonging to Pakistan International Airlines slammed into a hillside at Bhattedanda near Kathmandu Valley, killing 167 people on board.Earlier, on July 31, 1992, an Airbus A310 of Thai Airways crashed in Ghyangphedi, killing 113 on board.Nepal’s domestic airlines—nine fixed-wing operators and 12 helicopters—flew 4.15 million passengers in 2023. \nSri Lanka’s rich culture, wealth of natural resources, and diversity of accessible experiences make it one of the world’s best holiday destinations. The most common sight across the island nation is the tank cascades system, an ancient irrigation infrastructure—a network of small tanks draining to large reservoirs that store rainwater and surface runoff for later use. Despite being cash-strapped and plunging into its worst financial crisis in more than seven decades in 2022, Sri Lanka is now bouncing back, thanks to the growing number of tourists. We spent five days in the island country two weeks ago, driving up and down the island, covering almost 70 percent of its territory. Following the trip spanning over 1,000 kilometres, including hills, beach spots, and heritage and religious sites, the Post presents a travel guide to Sri Lanka. \nEducation in Every Home’s report titled ‘Diversity, Equity and Inclusion in Nepal’s Textbooks’ highlights the lack of diversity, inclusivity, and inaccuracies in these textbooks.  The findings include egregious mistakes in textbooks like the inclusion of a letter Abraham Lincloln supposedly wrote—dating to a time 17 years after his assassination, to assertions like Brazil has tigers, elephants and rhinos while Germany has tigers and monkeys. The books display a clear bias in favour of Brahmin Chhetri males, while women make up just 18 percent of all people profiled. While 80 percent of all bylines are male, the presence of marginalised communities, especially Dalits, is nearly non-existent.  \n\nThe Araniko Project, which is also a popular blog, aims to uncover the past and present of the Nepal-China relations by using primary sources in Mandarin. A fluent Mandarin speaker, Rajbhandari, who has lived in Beijing for six years, has a master’s degree in Chinese politics from Renmin University of China.  In this conversation, she talks about Chinese historiography on Nepal, the nuances of Mandarin-to-English translation, Nepal-China ties and the importance of understanding Chinese language in order to understand the country. \nA government panel and agitating Parliament staff on Monday forged a seven-point agreement. With the deal, the agitating staff have ended their protests.The agreement was reached following talks between the representatives of parliament staff and a three-member committee led by Padam Giri, minister for law, justice, and parliamentary affairs.According to the agreement, the government has agreed to raise the rental allowance, educational allowance, and meal expenses for employees working at the Parliament Secretariat.As per the deal, the monthly rental allowances for gazetted officers will be raised by Rs3,500, while non-gazetted staff will receive an increase of Rs3,000.Similarly, an agreement has been reached to raise the monthly education allowance by Rs300 and raise the daily meal expenses provided for overtime duty by Rs100. The amount will be released monthly.The government has committed to gradually fulfilling all of their demands.Starting last week, the Parliament employees refused to work overtime, directly affecting budget deliberations. Despite efforts by the lower house Speaker and the chairperson of the National Assembly, the issue could not be resolved as the government was reluctant to pay the staffers for extra work. They had lobbied with Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal and Finance Minister Barsha Man Pun jointly and individually to release the allowance but to no avail.With no sign of the employees giving up their protest, the government on Sunday had formed a three-member committee led by Minister Giri. \nIt’s been 10 days since Upendra Yadav got reelected Janata Samajbadi Party-Nepal (JSP-Nepal) chair unopposed from the party’s general convention held in Janakpur.Nearly two weeks since the inauguration of the convention and the election of the party chairman, the JSP-Nepal, however, hasn’t elected any other office bearers and central committee members so far.Incumbent chief Yadav was declared the party chair unopposed after no one threw their hat in the ring.After Yadav’s reelection on June 12, the process to elect the office-bearers and central committee members, scheduled for June 13, was halted saying that all other leaders would be chosen in consensus.Before the party decided to halt the election process, 23 candidates—17 men and six women—had filed their candidacies for the five positions of vice chairpersons; six candidates were vying for two posts of general secretary. Twelve aspirants—nine men and three women—filed their candidacies for the three posts of deputy general secretary.Besides, three leaders were in the fray for a treasurer position; and 34 leaders had filed their candidacies for seven positions of secretary.To the question of whether the leaders had deferred the election finding it difficult to pick individuals for available positions, party insiders gave multiple answers.A leader linked the leadership election deferral to the party split in the first week of May.A group of JSP-Nepal leaders split the party and formed the Janata Samajbadi Party under the leadership of Ashok Rai. The Election Commission registered the new outfit on May 6.The JSP-Nepal led by Yadav on May 13 moved the Supreme Court, accusing the commission of recognising its splinter group as a party without the legal basis.Yadav, in his petition, claimed that the commission had registered the party even without the required 40 percent central members on its side. The top court has ordered the relevant authorities to stall the process until the verdict and the case is still sub judice.The uncertainty prevents the newly formed Rai-led party from expediting its activities in a formal way. Seven of the 12 JSP-Nepal lawmakers in the federal parliament and 30 of the 406 party central committee members are with Rai.The new outfit’s plan to build its organisation at the provincial and local levels is in limbo due to the delayed court process. Leaders from the new party claimed that a large number of leaders and cadres are waiting to join the new organisation. Moreover, they are planning to embrace those aspirants of top positions when they are denied posts in central bodies. Observers of Madhesh politics claimed that the JSP-Nepal was unable to complete its election process with the splinter faction eying to lure its members. However, Manish Kumar Suman, one of the aspirants for general secretary in the JSP-Nepal, denied it. He claimed that the stalled general convention process, including the selection of leaders for office bearers positions, would be completed within a week.“As per the election commission deadline, we have to complete the whole general convention process within 35 days,” Suman told the Post. “We will complete the process before the timeframe.”Some political observers say the JSP-Nepal went for the general convention only out of the constitutional compulsion. If the party really wanted to follow the democratic process, it should have allowed the election process to go forward.Article 269 (4) (B) of the constitution mandates the political parties to hold the general convention at least once in five years.“Upendra Yadav has made himself the JSP-Nepal patron,” Shiva Chandra Chaudhary, a Madhesh political observer, told the Post. “He can select leaders loyal to him, having been reelected the party chairman. So he stalled the democratic process.”On the other hand, the new outfit—Janata Samajbadi Party—too has failed to give momentum to the party building process in the six weeks since its inception.The new outfit has gained prominence apparently with the support of the ruling coalition. The Election Commission swiftly registered the new party on May 6 with the name similar to the mother party despite legal ambiguities in the process. The JSP joined the ruling coalition immediately after its formation and supported the Pushpa Kamal Dahal-led government. The Rai-led party has been given a Cabinet minister and a state minister. On Saturday, when the Cabinet made recommendations for ambassadors to eight countries, two nominations went to the new outfit’s supporters. Ambassadors for Saudi Arabia and Spain were appointed in the JSP quotas. Days after the JSP-Nepal withdrew its support to the government, the Rai-led JSP gave its trust vote to Dahal and it supported the government in its policies and programmes.Lawmaker Sushila Shrestha of the JSP tried to downplay the difficulties saying that they were carrying out the party’s activities quietly. “We are engaged in several activities to strengthen the newly formed party, but we are not visible in the media,” Shrestha claimed. “Next Saturday and Sunday, our party’s central committee is meeting.” Shrestha claimed that her party is stronger than the JSP-Nepal in the provinces except for Madhesh. “We have been holding the meetings of provincial committees and are working to make our presence felt in Madhesh Province too.”Though Shrestha claims there are a number of activities within the party, political observers believe that its activities are stagnant due to the case sub judice in the court. “A writ petition in the Supreme Court related to the party split has stalled the new party formation,” Tula Narayan Shah, a political analyst, told the Post.Yadav has claimed the commission registered the party despite its failure to fulfil the required 40 percent support of central members for a party split. JSP-Nepal had 406 central committee members at the time of the party split, but the splinter group only had 30 central members with it.The newly formed JSP was registered amid a legal void as the Political Parties Act 2017 was replaced by an ordinance but not revived afterwards. According to the Act, a group of dissidents can split a party and form a new one if they can prove the support of at least 40 percent of the central committee members and at least 40 percent of the party’s lawmakers.However, this provision was nullified through an ordinance three years ago, leaving no legal basis for a party split. On June 9, the Supreme Court referred the dispute related to the party to the full bench. \nEmployee protests at Parliament Secretariat disrupt budget deliberations due to demands for overtime and odd-hour allowances, stalling progress and threatening timely endorsement of budget bills.\nThe news of former President Bidya Devi Bhandari renewing her party membership has become a matter of discussion in Parliament. The ninth general convention of CPN-UML held in Kathmandu in 2014 had elected Bhandari a vice-chair of the party. After Bhandari was elected the country’s President in 2015, she gave up the party membership as mandated by the constitution. She secured the second term in the presidential election following the 2017 parliamentary polls. After Ramchandra Paudel replaced her as the head of state last year, Bhandari has been relieved of duties and has been enjoying state facilities as a former President. Parliamentarians have started asking: Can a former head of state who has been enjoying state perks return to active politics? They have also demanded that the government look into the services provided to the former head of state. Speaking in the House of Representatives on Wednesday, Nepali Congress lawmaker Ramhari Khatiwada, who chairs the State Affairs and Good Governance Committee, said the government should clarify whether former President Bhandari qualifies for state benefits after renewing her UML membership. Media reports suggest the former President renewed her membership in a political party, Khatiwada said. “After the party membership renewal, can she still enjoy state benefits?” he questioned. “What is the state’s take on this?”He also demanded the government inform Parliament about the arrangements made for the former President.The Constitution of Nepal is silent on whether a former head of state can engage in active politics after leaving office.However, this is a question of constitutional ethics, says Raman Shrestha, a former attorney general.“If we look at the examples of other countries, a former head of state does not return to active politics, let alone by reclaiming the membership of a party,” Shrestha told the Post. “It is a question of ethics.” CPN (Maoist Centre) leader Pampha Bhusal said the question of morality only applies to the one who sticks to it. “If we see the history of Nepal, we find that a person who has become the prime minister has become an ambassador and taken other responsibilities,” Bhusal told the Post. “It is a personal decision whether to rejoin active politics after serving as the head of state. Let’s not make too big a fuss about this.”However, political observers and analysts say that when a person who has been receiving state benefits for their former role returns to active politics, it raises serious questions about that person and the party that gives the membership. Nepal has yet to formulate policies on the perks and benefits to be provided to a former head of state. The current practice is for the Cabinet to decide on such perks, according to an officer at the home ministry. “The former President gets a monthly stipend of Rs50,000. Another Rs200,000 is provided in monthly house rent,” said the officer. “If the former President has a house of their own in Kathmandu and decides to stay there, they get Rs100,000 a month in maintenance expenses.” They also get security personnel. However, the ministry officer refused to disclose the ‘sensitive’ security details. Ram Baran Yadav, the first President of Nepal, claims funds for housing from the government whereas Bhandari lives in her own house. Even before retiring from presidential duties, Bhandari had decided that she would go back to her own house, fuelling speculations about her plan to return to active politics. Bhandari is the widow of the late communist leader Madan Bhandari, who provided the ideological line to the UML. Most of Nepal’s major communist forces, the Maoist Centre led by Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal and the CPN (Unified Socialist) led by Madhav Kumar Nepal acknowledge the role of Madan Bhandari in advancing the communist cause in the country.UML Chairman KP Sharma Oli, Nepal and Dahal have once been together in a single political party after the 2017 elections. Whenever the communist forces form a coalition, as the three parties are doing now, the issue of their strategic partnership comes up.The Nepal Communist Party (NCP), as the unified force was called, saw a split when Dahal and Oli jointly chaired it but Oli is often criticised for being chiefly responsible for the unified party’s failure given his leadership style. Now when the three forces are rumoured to be planning to contest the 2027 elections on the same side, the chances of former President Bhandari returning to politics to potentially unite the parties as a leader acceptable to all are said to be high.Bhandari reportedly renewed party membership on the Nepali New Year day, more than two months ago. Madhav Dhungel, the secretary of the central organisation department of the UML, took to social media on June 18 to clarify the issue. “There is no doubt that Bhandari became President as a UML leader. But then she had to distance herself from the party, and she did so,” reads the facebook status of Dhungel. “However, she has the right to provide guardianship to the whole country, the Nepali people and the political party that she nurtured.”“Whether to return to active politics is a personal matter. If she [Bhandari] does so, she won’t do so on the sly,” Dhungel writes. “If she desires to be active in politics, she will undoubtedly do so in the UML.”On the question of Bhandari renewing her party membership, Kashinath Adhikari, the head of the party’s central organisation department, said he was not in a position to give a definite answer. “Membership in our party is renewed at the start of the [Nepali] new year,” Adhikari told the Post. “Who all have renewed party membership will be known only after going through the final list of those doing so in the given time.”  \nPrime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal on Thursday expressed his deep frustration over the low attendance of lawmakers and senior party leaders during his question and answer session in the House of Representatives.While low attendance in the House is not uncommon, as per the tradition, almost all lawmakers and senior leaders, except those with urgent commitments, are present when the prime minister speaks in the House or organises a question-answer session on contemporary issues.“The absence does not undermine the post of prime minister, it undermines the lawmakers themselves,” said Prime Minister Dahal, who was visibly distressed. Among those notably absent were top leaders including Nepali Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba, CPN-UML Chairman KP Oli and CPN (Unified Socialist) chief Madhav Nepal, as well as several Cabinet ministers and dozens of lawmakers from ruling and opposition benches. Out of 22, only eight ministers were present. A Nepali Congress leader said that Congress President Deuba was briefly present in the House, but had to leave due to health issues. But other senior Congress leaders and office bearers were notably absent. Similarly, CPN-UML chair Oli visited Parliament but did not enter the House. He left Parliament premises before the prime minister started speaking. Oli attended another function in the Capital.Several Cabinet ministers including two deputy prime ministers Raghubir Mahaseth and Narayan Kaji Shrestha were also absent when Dahal was responding to lawmakers’ queries. “There has been a tradition in Parliament that leaders of both opposition and ruling parties should be present when the prime minister speaks. The absence does not undermine the prime minister but rather the parliamentarians themselves. Except in emergencies, leaders of ruling and opposition parties, ministers and lawmakers traditionally attend the meeting where the prime minister speaks. But this tradition is being watered down, day by day. This definitely does not undermine the prime minister’s position,” said Dahal.The visibly upset prime minister said before concluding his statement by warning that “if such a trend continues, it is a gross insult to all of us.”Before making this statement, the prime minister answered questions from eleven lawmakers on various issues. He also discussed his recent visit to India and President Ramchandra Paudel’s visits to Switzerland and Germany.Prime Minister Dahal, earlier this month, attended the swearing-in ceremony of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi in New Delhi. He also held talks with Indian President Droupadi Murmu, Prime Minister Modi, and External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar, among other top officials.During his meetings with Modi and Jaishanker, Dahal said, issues related to strengthening bilateral ties, activating bilateral mechanisms between Nepal and India, and increasing Indian investment in Nepal, among others, were discussed.While speaking in the House, the prime minister expressed his dissatisfaction with budgetary allocations stating the ministers did not follow his directives.“Ministers should take the prime minister’s directive seriously while selecting projects and programmes,” said Dahal. “Despite my directives, small and micro projects are still being included in the budget. You will be ministers and prime ministers tomorrow, so we need to correct these practices.”“Despite tall promises, this fiscal year’s budget has several small and micro level projects below Rs30 million. The government had earlier promised to entrust projects and programmes under Rs30 million to provincial governments. I am not fully satisfied with the budget and its provisions.”While responding to lawmakers’ queries, the prime minister said that those responsible for the Tikapur massacre would be punished. As many as eight people, including a toddler and seven policemen, were killed by protesters on August 24, 2015 in the run up to the promulgation of the constitution. Dahal also assured that the government is committed to ensuring the identity and social and economic empowerment of the Tharus and other socially and economically marginalised communities.The prime minister also informed Parliament that Nepal and India are seriously considering two dedicated religious corridors—the Ramayana and Buddha circuits—to promote religious tourism.“We have ensured the budget for developing Ramayana, Shiva, Buddha, and Kirat circuits,” said the prime minister. “Fifteen different religious sites between Nepal and India will be connected under the Ramayana and Buddha circuits.” Nepal and India have already reached agreements and understandings on developing these circuits.Similarly, the prime minister stated that the government is committed to making ambassadorial appointments more orderly, dignified, transparent, and performance-based. He also defended the government’s recent decision to recall Nepal’s ambassadors from several countries, stating that the decision was in line with the constitution.The recent decision to recall envoys from 11 nations created quite an uproar in various quarters.“The government is committed to using diplomatic missions and envoys in the best interest of the nation,” he said. “As per the Ambassador Appointment Directive, 2015, the envoys can be recalled before completing their terms, if necessary.”“Typically, only those appointed under political quota are recalled immediately after a change in coalition,” the prime minister said. “But this time, the envoys remained in their posts for more than three months after a change in the ruling coalition.”Dahal said this was proof of how the government was serious about the issue.Government picks some ambassadors under political quota based on recommendations from coalition partners while it selects some career diplomats from within the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.Talking about his recent India visit, Prime Minister Dahal also said that there were discussions on effective implementation of the agreements reached between the two South Asian neighbours.According to Dahal, among the issues discussed during a meeting with his Indian counterpart, Narendra Modi, were strengthening Nepal-India relations, implementation of past agreements, and bilateral discussions—including border disputes. “There were serious discussions on the implementation of the Pancheshwar Multipurpose Project, Arun Hydropower Project and cooperation in the agricultural sector,” Dahal said.Likewise, the prime minister stated that the government has initiated the formation of a high-level committee to address the challenges being faced by cooperatives.After the committee’s input and suggestions, crisis-ridden cooperatives will be identified and action initiated to return deposits and manage their assets.Dahal said that more than Rs772.44 million has already been refunded to the victims of cooperatives.Addressing the meeting, Dahal stated that 59,587 individuals, affected by cooperatives, had filed complaints alleging embezzlement of deposits totalling Rs36.28 billion. Of this, the government has so far paid back Rs 772.44 million.The prime minister added that the government had declared 20 different cooperatives as ‘crisis-ridden’ and that the process of refunding affected depositors was being facilitated through the Crisis-ridden Cooperative Management Committee.Dahal also mentioned that efforts are underway for a separate legal procedure to establish an independent regulatory body to protect cooperative savings.“The government is aware of the problems faced by cooperatives and is serious about addressing them. Various efforts have been made to implement the suggestions of the high-level task force and agreements reached with the cooperative victims under the coordination of the National Planning Commission last year,” he said.Prime Minister Dahal said that a committee had also been formed at the provincial and local levels to solve the problems of those affected by cooperatives.A law to establish an authority to regulate and supervise large-scale cooperatives is also being drafted, Dahal said. “Not all cooperatives are in trouble. Many have helped lift people’s livelihoods while operating based on established international practices and as per the law,” Dahal said.He added that despite the significant increase in the number of cooperatives, there were plenty of shortcomings in their qualitative improvement. \nWith the general convention of the CPN (Unified Socialist) approaching closer, top leaders of the party have intensified their preparations and lobbying for the top posts.As they expedite their lobbying through various informal channels, the party leaders in their formal speeches are emphasising the need of electing the leadership through a consensus.Senior leader Jhalanath Khanal did the same on Monday.A group of CPN-UML leaders led by Madhav Kumar Nepal, the party’s former chief, split the country’s largest communist party to form the CPN (Unified Socialist) in August 2021. They split the party protesting against UML chair KP Sharma Oli’s decision to dissolve the House of Representatives twice.Following a poor performance in the 2022 elections, where it failed even to secure the status of the national party, the CPN (Unified Socialist) is now struggling to retain party members. Despite holding important portfolios in the federal and provincial governments, the party leaders are finding it difficult even to stop its members from rejoining their old party, the UML, let alone attracting new members.Amid the diminishing influence, the party is gearing up for the general convention scheduled for June 30 to July 4 in Kathmandu.If the claims recently made by the leaders are anything to go by, the two former prime ministers—Nepal and Khanal—will face each other for the position of party chief during the general convention. Both of the leaders also led the CPN-UML in the past.Khanal on Monday emphasised the need of electing the party leadership through a consensus.While addressing the event to launch ‘Mahila Sankalpa-2’, which is the mouthpiece of the party’s women’s wing, All Nepal Women’s Association, Khanal stressed the need for a consensual election of the leaders. However, a certain criteria of leadership should be followed, Khanal said.“To strengthen the leadership within the party, we must select the leaders of the party through a consensus,” Khanal said during the programme. “Since our party was formed on the basis of an ideological ground, political direction, and certain policies and principles, we all should strive to maintain these values while selecting the leadership as well.”A party insider claimed that Khanal staked his claim for the top position as his political line was adopted in the political document to be presented in the general convention. Party general secretary Ghanashyam Bhusal prepared the political document to be presented in the general convention of the party. While in the UML, party chair Nepal embraced Madan Bhandari’s People’s Multi-party Democracy unconditionally for many years while Khanal and Bhusal viewed it critically. According to party leaders, Khanal and Bhusal have succeeded in including their ideas in the Unified Socialist’s official line.“In politics, the leaders whose policies prevail as the party’s official line should get the opportunity to lead the party,” a party leader told the Post on the condition of anonymity. “Though the political document of the party is guided by the thoughts of general secretary Bhusal, Khanal also owns it, so he is claiming the leadership.”This does not mean that party chair Nepal has not owned the political document passed by the party's central committee, but the document is closer to the political line advocated by Bhusal and Khanal for a long time, said a party insider.Party chair Nepal, while addressing the same programme on Monday, also said that there are no differences among the leaders in terms of the party’s ideological line. “The preparation of the political, organisational and other documents to be presented in the upcoming congress is a collective effort of party leaders and cadres,” Nepal said.In addition to Nepal and Khanal, the party's general secretary Bhusal is also considering contesting for the party chair in the upcoming congress, though he has not publicly announced it yet.“Matters related to the aspiration of the leaders for the post of office bearers will be clear only after the selection of convention representatives,” Jeevan Ram Shrestha, the secretary of the party, told the Post. “Before the selection of the representatives, all things that have come from the media are mere speculation.”The party has decided to select general convention representatives from around the country on Wednesday. Shrestha said that the selection of representatives will make things clearer about the aspirants’ claims.Khanal has already opened his contact office at Baneshwar with a plan to manage his team’s activities during the general convention.Though Khanal has opened his contact office, he may or may not contest for the vital post, says another leader of the party who does not want to disclose his identity. The leader said that it might be under his publicity strategy. “If the political scenario is not in his favour, Khanal might back Bhusal for the leadership of the party to challenge Nepal,” the leader claimed. “On the other hand, Nepal, the present chair of the party, might also back Bhusal if he senses a tough challenge from Khanal.”Bhusal has remained tightlipped about his candidacy in view of the situation, a leader close to Bhusal said. “If the two top leaders decide to face each other, Bhusal might settle with his current position of general secretary.”The party’s deputy general secretaries, Jagan Nath Khatiwada and Parkash Jwala, have already announced their bid for the post of general secretary.The party will most likely select the leadership through consensus, says another leader. Meanwhile, there are voices in favour of continuing present chair Nepal in the position saying that he has put utmost efforts to establish the party after the split and sustain it amid a challenging situation. But there are also leaders who want Khanal’s leadership.“One of the two leaders will possibly lead the party,” Unified Socialist leader Som Prasad Pandey, who is close to Nepal, told the Post. “Though Bhusal’s name is also in the discussion for the post of chair, he is most likely to continue as the general secretary.”Meanwhile, former CPN-UML vice-chair Bhim Rawal, who has remained inactive in the UML after the party's convention held in November 2021 in Chitwan, is reportedly considering joining the Unified Socialist from the upcoming congress. In 2021, Rawal challenged Oli for the position of party chair despite Oli’s request not to do so. Since then, Rawal has been given no role in the UML.“Our party is in talks with Bhim Rawal to bring him to the party. We have already held two rounds of negotiation with him,” Shrestha, the secretary, told the Post. “If everything goes as planned, Rawal will join our party with a respectable position.”The Post’s attempts to contact Rawal to confirm Shrestha’s claim were unsuccessful. \nA police officer was found dead on the premises of the federal parliament building in Baneshwar, Kathmandu on Wednesday.According to Ekram Giri, spokesperson for the federal parliament secretariat, Ajit Gole of Dolakha committed suicide by shooting himself.The body of the victim was recovered from the parliament building’s washroom.Dinesh Mainali, spokesperson for the Kathmandu Metro Police Range, said Gole, who was on duty from 6am to 10am, was found dead at around 8 in the morning. “A constable of Nepal Police was found dead inside a toilet of the parliament building,” Mainali told the Post. “Preliminary investigation shows he was inflicted with a gunshot.”Nepal police said the investigation is underway. \nPolice on Friday arrested two people from Thimi of Bhaktapur for allegedly mining cryptocurrency.The Central Investigation Bureau took 50-year-old Biswas Gurung and Rajendra Tahamata, 25, into custody in connection with the crime, said Hobindra Bogati, spokesperson for the bureau.The duo allegedly ran mining operations from the CTEVT’s information technology lab using a server and 64 desktops, on which blockchain applications were found during a preliminary investigation. Further investigation into the matter is underway. \nThe Central Investigation Bureau has arrested three individuals on charges of embezzlement of over Rs74 million of the Kathmandu-based Square Savings and Credit Cooperative.Those arrested include cooperative chair Basudev Man Joshi, 66, of Kathmandu Metropolitan City-14; secretary Subarna Selalik, 67, of Kathmandu-25; and member Dharma Ratna Pachhai, 58, of Kathmandu-26.Superintendent of Police Hobindra Bogati, who is also the spokesperson for the CIB, said they were arrested on Friday. On Sunday, Kathmandu District Court remanded them for a week for further investigation.According to him, the cooperative operators have been accused of luring depositors with the promise of attractive interest rates but failing to return their deposits. \nDays after Kathmandu Mayor Balendra Shah joined the Nepali Congress in accusing CPN-UML chair KP Sharma Oli in a multi-billion-rupee failed land swap bid in Jhapa, lawmakers from the main opposition have backed Shah in his initiative to expand the sidewalks at New Road—something the UML opposes.Speaking in the House of Representatives on Thursday, Congress General Secretary Bishwo Prakash Sharma backed the mayor's plan to expand pedestrian lanes at New Road that clashed with the vision of the Road Division, led by a UML minister, to widen the roads instead. Lawmaker Sharma said that in case of conflict between a central agency and a local unit, the federal government should show more restraint than the local government.“Mayor Balendra Shah’s initiative to widen pavements at New Road is the right step for the general public’s convenience,” Sharma told the House. “Mayor Shah should be allowed to continue his work without any interference as what he is doing is absolutely right.”The conflict escalated when the Road Division, under the federal government, intervened and paved the road cut by the metropolis on Monday. The metropolis had cleared stretches a few metres wide on either side of the road to create space for pavements. The dispute resulted in a standoff between those deployed by the Road Division and the Kathmandu municipal staff, with different people taking different sides. The tension eased without any untoward incident as the metropolis backed off after the federal government deployed police at the site.The Road Division, under the Ministry of Physical Infrastructure and Transport, is led by Deputy Prime Minister Raghubir Mahaseth, who is a UML secretary. The dispute grew to involve those supporting Mayor Shah and the UML, the biggest partner in the Pushpa Kamal Dahal-led coalition, and also spilled over to social media.In Parliament, lawmakers from the main opposition Nepali Congress threw their weight behind Shah.Not only the party’s general secretary Sharma, two other lawmakers from the party also expressed their support for the mayor in the House meeting on Thursday. Congress lawmaker Arjun Narsingh KC said the conflict between the federal government and the Kathmandu mayor has raised serious questions about the federal government’s intent. KC stressed that cooperation and collaboration between the federal, provincial, and local governments is essential in avoiding conflict and resolving disputes between the three federal units. He said Articles 232 and 235 of the constitution and related schedules clearly define their jurisdictions.“The recent conflict between the federal and local governments and the saga of making and breaking of a road section have raised serious questions,” KC said. He urged the government not to resort to violence and to resolve the issue in a rational way.Another Congress lawmaker, Kanti Sejuwal, also speaking in the zero hour of Parliament, questioned the government for clashing with the municipal authority. “Either we should scrap the Local Government Operation Act 2017, or the federal government should let Balendra work.”As the Road Division intervened in Mayor Shah’s plan to widen the pavement in the New Road area, Sejuwal had expressed his anger at UML chair Oli.Following the federal agency’s intervention, the mayor wrote on social media, alleging Oli’s involvement in the attempted illegal swapping of land at the Birtamode-based Giri Bandhu Tea Estate worth billions of rupees. The largest party, the Congress, had been accusing the UML chief of being complicit in the land swap issue.A few days ago, Shah also engaged in a heated exchange with the KMC’s Ward 22 chairman Chinkaji Maharjan, a UML member, over the sidewalk expansion. Even before that, municipal staff dumped a truckload of dirt and trash outside the Kathmandu Road Division office, claiming that the delayed road expansion work from Kalanki to Maharajgunj had inconvenienced the public.Earlier, on May 14, the Congress parliamentary party meeting had decided to raise the issue of the tea estate land in Parliament. The Oli government, formed after the 2017 general elections, allowed the owners of the tea estate to swap 343.19 bighas (232.43 hectares) of land it occupied, based on a revision to the Land Act (1964). The Act was revised in January 2020, under the Oli administration, introducing a provision for allowing a swap or selling of land to pay off the tea estate’s liabilities if it went into liquidation. Asked if the Congress had backed the mayor as he alleged the UML chair Oli’s involvement in the Tea Estate land scam, the Congress publicity department head Min Bahadur Bishwokarma denied it. “Party lawmakers including the general secretary must have backed the mayor as the New Road sidewalk issue is of public concern, and not necessarily because it involves the UML,” Bishwokarma said. \nDead bodies of a man and a woman were found on a cliff in Dakshinkali Municipality-8, located on the southern outskirts of Kathmandu.According to the Kathmandu Valley Police Office, the bodies were spotted approximately 200 metres down the hill from the Kathmandu-Dakshinkali road.Senior Superintendent of Police Dinesh Raj Mainali said that the preliminary investigation suggests they died in an accident, as a crashed motorcycle was found near the bodies.Mainali said a disaster management team of Nepal Police is working to retrieve the bodies from the hill. He said locals informed the police after spotting the bodies on Wednesday evening.The police said the deceased woman is a 32-year-old resident of Changunarayan Municipality-5, while the man is yet to be identified. \nPrivate dairies have requested subsidised loans from the government to settle farmers' dues, amounting to nearly Rs3 billion, amid the ongoing dairy sector slump.They have also requested the government to permit them to export dairy products such as powdered milk, butter, and cheese, as consumption within the country has remained subdued. As a result, the stock has been piling up. Recently, the government partially bailed out the state-owned Dairy Development Corporation by providing Rs300 million in soft loans. After dairy farmers started protests, officials privy to the matter told the Post that the government is preparing to release another Rs600 million to the corporation. The corporation had in February said that the dairy industry was suffering from a recession and hoped that sales would increase in summer. But it didn’t.Both state-owned and private dairy companies said that the ongoing economic slowdown has dampened dairy demand, resulting in stopped cash flow and rising liabilities to farmers as products remained unsold for months.“We are unable to pay farmers due to unsold products. The stock, too, is huge,” said Prahlad Dahal, president of the Nepal Dairy Association.“So we have requested the Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock Development to provide a soft loan keeping our dairy products as collateral. We have also requested the government to open up exports so that we can sell our products and become able to pay the farmers.” The association is scheduled to meet the agriculture minister on Monday. “We hope that our request will be heeded,” said Dahal. The association has requested a soft loan for more than 50 percent of its remaining stock. Private dairies have stocks of powdered milk and butter worth Rs5 billion, said Dahal.According to the association, the committee formed by the agriculture ministry to study the payment issues of dairy farmers found that around Rs4.50 billion is due to be paid by dairies to the farmers. The amount was previously Rs7 billion.This shows that payment is being made gradually, Dahal said. “But that is not sufficient.”Consumer demand for milk and other dairy-related products declined last year, with the government hiking the price of raw milk to benefit and encourage more dairy farmers to join the sector. However, the unscientific hike hit demand amid the people's declining incomes due to the economic slowdown.Regarding price reduction to increase consumption, Dahal said private diaries have a high cost of production, so it will not be possible to reduce the price.The government also imposes VAT on dairy products like ghee, ice cream, and cheese. “If the VAT is waived, prices will come down, which can boost the sales,” said Dahal.According to the association, nearly 1 million litres of milk comes from the formal sector, which implies a daily transaction of Rs70 million.“If the soft loan is provided and export is permitted, we will be able to clear all the farmers' dues by September,” Dahal said.Dairy entrepreneurs said that the butter stock is gradually being cleared, and milk production has declined, balancing stock and output.Last Wednesday, dairy farmers demonstrated outside the Lainchaur-based Dairy Development Corporation, demanding immediate settlement of their outstanding payments. Police arrested dozens of dairy farmers during the protest.Around 50 farmers were arrested as they attempted to picket the corporation. According to the association, 600,000 families are associated with the dairy sector, contributing 45,000 jobs. More than Rs60 million cash flows from urban to rural areas daily, and the government collects revenue of more than Rs2 billion monthly.“The agriculture ministry has called us for a meeting on Monday,” said Amar Bahadur Kunwar, president of the Central Dairy Cooperatives Association. “Both private and government dairy industries have more than Rs5 billion in dues to be paid to dairy farmers.”Dahal said the state-owned corporation alone has outstanding dues of Rs2 billion to the dairy farmers.The corporation even issued a public notice on June 10 inviting bids to sell its butter and powdered milk. As per the notice, it planned to sell 200 tonnes of butter (15kg block) and 300 tonnes of skimmed powdered milk (25kg bag).In another notice on Sunday, the corporation fixed the skimmed powdered milk rates. The country currently produces more than 6 million litres of milk daily. The corporation purchases around 25 percent of it. \nIn Nepal, the festivals measure the economy. Last Dashain, the cash crunch forced consumers to trim purchases.After a year, the situation seems unimproved.“We are not in the mood to place orders for goods for upcoming festivities,” said Ram Hari Karki, president of Nepal Trans Himalayan Border Commerce Association. “There is no demand at all. It looks like a deep economic slowdown.”Usually, traders place orders for foreign goods, particularly apparel, three months before the start of Nepal’s key festival season. Even though traders bring some amount of goods, it may be costlier. Due to the appreciation of the US dollar and increased customs duties, the prices of goods and commodities may rise, causing difficulties for many ordinary Nepalis.“Goods are becoming costlier day by day. That is why traders are cautious this year about placing orders,” said Karki. “The demand for festivities has not returned to the pre-pandemic level.”There are no statistics about consumption during the Dashain, Tihar, and Chhath festivals, but analysts say it grows manifold compared to the normal time. Kumar Karki, president of the Nepal National Traders’ Federation, said due to subdued demand, they may see a business decline by 15–20 percent. In comparison, prices may rise by 20 percent in the upcoming festivals.Even during the summer, traders say the market has slowed down.“Despite the rising heat, the demand for summer garments and shoes has not picked up,” said a trader in New Road, the country’s central shopping hub. “The footfall of shoppers has declined compared to last year’s season, reflecting the decline in people’s incomes.”“Nowadays, only a handful of traders are planning their trip to China to order goods. We don’t see demand recovering from last year’s drop,” said Kumar Karki.Some traders say there is a shift in the trade.In the past years, China fulfilled 80 percent of Nepal’s need for readymade garments.However, according to three top traders who spoke to the Post, the market seems flooded with Indian goods, which are relatively cheaper.Currently, traders said, an average of 15–20 loaded trucks are entering from Kerung and Tatopani customs points to the north, carrying garments, shoes and slippers, raincoats, and umbrellas, among other items. Before the Covid pandemic, 50–60 loaded trucks used to enter Nepal from the Chinese border at this time of the year.Cost is the key factor in subdued demand.On Friday, the Nepali rupee plunged to an all-time low of Rs134.15 against the dollar. A strong US dollar has advantages and disadvantages. It has negative impacts on an import-based economy like Nepal.“While importing goods, we must pay 30 to 40 percent as customs duty. The high customs duty has made imported goods expensive,” said Kumar Karki. The government needed to ease customs through the coming fiscal year's budget and further tighten it, he said. Importing goods through legal channels is becoming more difficult day by day, especially at the customs, and this has encouraged the illegal import of goods. This has resulted in an import decline.According to the central bank's macroeconomic report, the inflation rate on non-food and services remained at 2.96 percent in mid-May this year, compared to 8.89 percent a year ago. The year-on-year price index of clothes and footwear remained at 3.46 percent.Market analysts, however, say that data presents different facts than the actual market scenario. Economists say that youth are the significant spenders, and demand has declined in sectors like education and restaurants, including consumption of goods and services, as many youths have migrated abroad to study and work.Economist Nara Bahadur Thapa said that import-related activities used to increase by 30 percent with the start of a new fiscal year compared to other months before Covid. However, the number of traders importing goods by opening Letters of Credit (LC) has declined in recent years.“From July to October, imports used to spike and cross Rs200 billion per month, but now, even with the rise in foreign exchange rate, it hardly crosses Rs150 billion. This shows that the demand has declined as a result of economic slowdown,” Thapa said.Thapa said that as people's purchasing power has declined, the demand for different goods in major festival times has declined. The salaries of government and private sector employees have not increased in the past few years. “People are not going to spend unless they have money in their hands.”According to the Department of Customs, Nepal’s imports declined by 1.84 percent to Rs1.45 trillion in the first eleven months of the current fiscal year, which ended in mid-June, compared to the same period last fiscal year.The country’s imports slipped 16.08 percent to Rs1.61 trillion in the last fiscal year. \n\nThe Nepali rupee recorded an all-time low, with Nepal’s central bank fixing the exchange rate at Rs134.15 per US dollar for Friday.The Nepali currency was weakened by 31 paisa against the dollar in a single day. The rupee’s fall is attributed to a steady depreciation of the Indian rupee, to which it is pegged.Experts say Nepal, an import-driven economy, may see a sharp rise in inflation due to the dollar's strength, as almost all goods and services are quoted in dollar terms.Commodities like edible oil, petroleum fuel, and foods are priced in dollars globally, so a stronger dollar adds to the cost of Nepali consumers. As food expenditures make up large shares of consumption, the constant weakening of the local currency makes the goods dearer in Nepal.Traders say apparel prices may rise in the upcoming festival season as they have started to place orders. Kumar Karki, president of the Nepal National Traders’ Federation, said the rising dollar may make goods, particularly apparel and electronics, more expensive during the Dashain and Tihar festivals. According to estimates, sales of food and non-food items surge manifold during the festival period.Traders have already started visiting China to place orders, especially for goods to be imported for festival sales in October, said Karki. Most festival goods, such as readymade clothes, shoes, bags, and accessories, are imported from China.According to media reports, the dollar strengthened as the Swiss National Bank delivered an interest-rate cut, underscoring the divergence in monetary policies among global central banks as the US Federal Reserve delayed easing policy. In India, the central bank has allowed the rupee to weaken, though it intervenes to curb wild swings. Nepali currency automatically strengthens when the Indian currency is strong and weakens when the Indian currency weakens. Nepal has been following a pegged exchange rate system with the Indian rupee.Nepal adopts a different kind of exchange rate system for other convertible currencies.In line with the economic liberalisation policy introduced in the mid-1980s, Nepal introduced current account convertibility in 1993, effectively pegging the Nepali rupee to the Indian rupee at the rate of 1.60, the same rate as in 1960 when the two currencies were first pegged. Since 1993, the exchange rate of the Nepali rupee with other convertible currencies has been market-determined in line with the exchange rate of the Indian rupee with convertible currencies.A strong US dollar has both advantages and disadvantages for a country like Nepal. It benefits some but negatively impacts others.According to Nara Bahadur Thapa, former executive director of Nepal Rastra Bank, the depreciation of the domestic currency could exert pressure on the balance of payments as Nepal would have to spend more money to buy foreign goods.According to him, the depreciation of the domestic currency is likely to worsen inflation, as the country is highly dependent on imported goods and has low domestic output.“The currency’s devaluation makes exports cheaper, measured in foreign currency, and imports become more expensive, measured in the home currency.”The price effect may lead the goods and services sector of Nepal to weaken, said Karki. According to Nepal Rastra Bank, the country’s central bank, in the first ten months of the current fiscal year, merchandise exports decreased by 3.6 percent to Rs126.17 billion.However, merchandise imports amounted to a staggering Rs1.30 trillion in the review period.The most significant impact will be on purchasing petroleum products, Nepal’s biggest import, on which the country is fully dependent. It will also impact the cost of chemical fertiliser.On the other hand, the appreciation of the US dollar can benefit remittance earners. Remittance inflows increased 19.2 percent to Rs1.19 trillion in the review period. Another advantage will be on the foreign exchange reserve, according to experts.Those countries with ample reserves may sell foreign exchange to bolster their currencies. Nepal’s gross foreign exchange reserves increased to a record $14.54 billion in mid-May.Similarly, a soaring US dollar means tourists can buy more of the Nepali currency. Visitors from abroad will find the prices of goods and services in Nepal cheaper with a stronger dollar.Travel income, the money spent by foreigners, increased 35 percent to Rs69.41 billion in the first ten months of the current fiscal year.The strong dollar increases the burden of debt repayment in local currency terms.Thus, as the dollar becomes stronger relative to other currencies, these repayments become more expensive in terms of the domestic currency.The price of gold also increases in the local market when the dollar rises.The Nepali currency vis-à-vis the US dollar depreciated 1.61 percent in mid-May 2024 from mid-July 2023, while it had depreciated 2.79 percent in the same period of the previous year. \nNineteen-year-old Ekta suffers from excruciating pain during her periods. It is far beyond the usual pain and cannot be managed with medication–she’s tried that multiple times. Taking one dose of Meftal (a period pain medication) is never enough. The pain is debilitating most of the time.Despite several visits to gynaecologists, her complaints have been brushed aside as normal period pains. She strongly feels that her pain is abnormal, but feels powerless to address her issues.“The pain is so bad, but I cannot do anything about it,” she says. “I can’t count the number of times that I’ve been told that my debilitating pain is normal,” bemoans Ekta, whose name has been changed to protect her privacy.The normalisation of period pains means serious reproductive conditions like endometriosis often go untreated. People with endometriosis experience severe pelvic pain because tissues like that found outside the uterus grow inside it. Other symptoms of the condition include heavy bleeding during and between periods and fatigue. There is no known cure for this condition, and symptoms can start from the first period onwards.A major challenge experienced by women with endometriosis is the disregard of their symptoms by the public and medical professionals alike. Due to lack of awareness about the debilitating pain typical to endometriosis, both the person suffering from the condition, and their doctors often underestimate their severity.Severe pelvic pain is a key indicator for diagnosing endometriosis, says Dr Reena Shrestha, a gynaecologist at Madhyapur Hospital. When patients seek consultation regarding the kind of severe pain that significantly disrupts their lives, they may undergo two types of tests: transvaginal ultrasound and diagnostic laparoscopy. These procedures are used to determine the presence of endometriosis. Endometriosis is a complex condition, says Dr Hema Pradhan, a consultant gynaecologist at Everest Hospital. Amongst all the patients she meets at her consultations, many frequently turn out to have endometriosis. But, she’s noticed that often patients often delay seeking treatment because period pains are often normalised.“Women who come to me with their symptoms often delay seeking treatment, because, regardless of the severity of their pain, they believe all period pains to be normal,” says Pradhan.Eighteen-year-old Rima (name change) has been struggling with excessive pain before and during periods for years. She also experiences pain while urinating during her periods. Rima has also been diagnosed with Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome (PCOS). The co-occurence of PCOS and endometriosis is not unheard of, although research on them has been minimal.“I can barely walk when I’m on my periods, but I’ve always been told that I should just learn to live with it,” she says.Despite knowing about PCOS, she discovered the possibility of having endometriosis quite later in life. She shares this because period pain, even excessive ones, have been normalised for far too long.The general lack of awareness of endometriosis, and widespread normalisation of period pains, often results in late diagnosis and treatment of the condition.Although there may be no cure to the condition, there are ways to manage its most severe symptoms. Furthermore, receiving a diagnosis can greatly help patients to understand the severity of their condition, according to doctors. “I’m incapable of doing anything during my periods. One time I had to leave the examination in the middle of my exams because of the pain,” says Ekta. “I can’t study, can’t work, all I can do is stay in bed and cry,” she adds.Dr Pradhan reveals another challenging aspect of diagnosing endometriosis. Sometimes the condition may not appear on ultrasound scans initially. Endometrial deposits may appear differently in women due to hormonal changes. Furthermore, symptoms may vary, with some being asymptomatic altogether. According to Dr Shrestha, once a gynaecologist confirms that the patient has endometriosis, they will certainly recommend methods to manage the pain. These include analgesics for pain relief, and home remedies like hot water bag massage.However, the main problem remains. Due to lack of awareness, most patients may only find out about their condition later in life.In some cases women only discover they have endometriosis when they face infertility. Endometriosis is associated with infertility, and 30-50% of people with endometriosis may experience infertility. This also exposes another troubling aspect associated with endometriosis. Ekta shares that her relatives often express concerns about her potential infertility.“They just make me feel bad that I might never get pregnant. And it makes me feel worse,” Ekta adds.Worldwide, endometriosis has been known as a scientifically under-researched condition. It has even been called the ‘missed disease’ because of inconsistencies in its diagnosis and treatment. Endometriosis has also been widely ignored by policy makers.Treatment for endometriosis depends on the individual, says Dr Pradhan. Some are treated with hormonal medication, and others require surgical procedures. The main way to combat endometriosis is timely diagnosis, and timely treatment, she adds.“Raising awareness, timely diagnosis, and treatment are very important,” Dr Pradhan says. \nLast month, a local from Sindhupalchowk district was brought to Sukraraj Tropical and Infectious Disease Hospital to treat a snakebite. Along with the victim, relatives brought the live snake in a bottle to show the doctor as proof.“The snake was a king cobra,” said Dr Yuba Nidhi Basaula, director at the Hospital. “Fortunately, the venom had not penetrated deep into the victim’s body, and after three days of treatment, the victim was discharged. We called a snake handler and handed over the king cobra.”Sindhupalchowk is a mountain district where venomous snakes were thought of as non-existent. However, incidents of king cobra bites in mountain districts like Sindhupalchowk suggest that venomous snakes have started migrating towards hill and mountain districts, and rising temperatures caused by climate change are the main culprit, experts say.Nepal is among the world’s most vulnerable countries to the climate crisis and has witnessed multiple extreme weather events over the past decade and a half.Evidence suggests that maximum temperatures in Nepal are rising at a faster rate of 0.056 degrees Celsius a year, compared to the global average rise of 0.03 degrees Celsius a year. Compared to districts of the Tarai region, those in hills and mountains have been witnessing a more rapid increase in daytime maximum temperatures, which could have helped venomous snakes survive there, experts say.“Not only in Sindhupalchowk, but a king cobra bite was also spotted in Godawari of Lalitpur district last year,” said Basaula. “Snakebite cases have started rising alarmingly of late.”Of the 31 patients admitted to the hospital on Sunday, 16—more than 50 percent—were snakebite cases. Doctors at the hospital say eight to ten snakebite victims seek treatment there every day, and most victims seeking care at the hospital are from the districts of Kathmandu Valley or from those adjoining the Valley.Each year, around 2,700 people, mostly children and women from Nepal’s Tarai region, die of snakebites, according to a March 2022 report published in The Lancet, a leading international medical journal.However, snakebite cases are vastly underreported in the country. The Ministry of Health and Population said that only 14 deaths and 1,220 cases of snakebites had been reported in 11 months of the current fiscal year. Officials admit that venomous snakebite incidents are being reported from hill and mountain districts, and the demand for anti-snake venom is on the rise. They attribute this rise in snakebite incidents to rising temperatures. “Health facilities in some mountainous and hilly districts—like Darchula and Bajura—have asked for anti-snake venom,” said Dr Hemanta Chandra Ojha, an official at the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division. “Snakebite incidents have been on the rise,” said Dr Hemanta Chandra Ojha, an official at the division. “With the onset of the monsoon, people living in the risk areas should remain vigilant.”Every year, the Health Ministry purchases around 25,000 vials of anti-snake venom and distributes them to around 100 snakebite treatment centres in the country.Officials say as snakebite cases surge, so will the demand for additional treatment centres. “This year, we are planning to set up an additional 15 snakebite treatment centres,” said Ojha. Public health experts have urged authorities to launch an awareness drive about the risks. They say people living in thatched-roof houses are particularly vulnerable to snakebites, as snakes often enter such homes in search of rats. They say people should be asked to keep their homes and surroundings clean, prevent children from playing in bushy areas, avoid venturing out at night, and use torchlights while walking in the dark.Likewise, women and children who have to work in fields and go to the jungle are at the highest risk of snakebites. Small children are at risk of dying from snakebites, as they do not tell their parents about the bites on time due to fear of getting scolded for playing in the bushes, according to doctors.“We should make people aware so that they seek medical attention immediately after a snakebite, using whatever means of transport they get,” said Ojha. “The faster you reach the hospital, the greater your chances of survival.” \nA 45-year-old woman from Dhapasi, Kathmandu was diagnosed with high blood pressure, high cholesterol and diabetes some six months ago. Doctors at the National Cardiac Center, who attended to the patient prescribed medicines and advised her to change her lifestyle and eating habits to control the ailments.“The patient, who was worried about her health conditions, took the doctors’ advice seriously and joined a yoga class in the morning, made a drastic change in her eating habits, and engaged in physical activities,” said Dr Om Murti Anil, a senior cardiologist. “Her blood pressure, blood sugar and cholesterol levels are now under control, and she has also reduced her weight. Now, she doesn't need the high dose of medicines like in the past. ”This was a common refrain among a few patients, who took doctors' advice seriously, changed their lifestyles and eating habits, joined yoga classes, and increased physical activity, which helped them control high blood pressure, blood sugar and cholesterol levels.Public health experts say changing eating habits, lessening body weight, and starting physical activities, including yoga and physical exercises, help control non-communicable diseases, which have emerged as a major public health problem in Nepal.Studies show that non-communicable diseases have emerged as a serious public health issue in Nepal, accounting for around 80 percent of total deaths. A 2019 study by the Nepal Health Research Council on the prevalence of noncommunicable diseases found that they accounted for 71 percent of the deaths in the country. The study primarily focused on behavioural risk factors—tobacco and alcohol consumption—and biological risk factors—raised blood pressure, overweight, obesity, abnormal lipid prevalence, coronary artery disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and diabetes. The findings showed that the leading risk factor for death in 2019 was smoking, accounting for 17.7 percent deaths, followed by high systolic blood pressure at 12.3 percent, household air pollution at 11.2 percent, ambient air pollution at 9.3 percent, diabetes at 8 percent, as well as high cholesterol, kidney dysfunction.Additionally, around 8 percent of the deaths were attributed to accidents, including road traffic accidents.“For many patients, doctors have to increase the doses of medicines, as every time they come for follow-up, their reports often get worse,” said Anil. “To reduce weight, change lifestyle and eating habits, strong commitments are needed, and very few people have such determination.”Many patients, despite knowing that they are at high risk of dying due to inactivity, do not change their lifestyle or start physical activity. Doctors warn that non-communicable diseases—hypertension, heart disease, stroke and diabetes, among others—could lead to a public health crisis if not addressed immediately. They blame a sedentary lifestyle and the consumption of processed foods as chief culprits for the growing burden of non-communicable diseases and obesity.They warn that people from all walks of life have been affected by the repercussions of changing lifestyles and food habits. Entire family members suffer if any member, particularly the breadwinner, faces serious health problems.Experts say continuous awareness campaigns about the rising prevalence of non-communicable diseases, the promotion of healthy lifestyles, and the start of yoga classes in community centres, schools, and open-air gyms could help lessen the growing burden of non-communicable diseases. “Physical exercises not only help in managing the disease conditions but also lessen the risk of developing non-communicable diseases,” said Dr Munkarna Thapa, information officer at the Department of Ayurveda and Alternative Medicine. “Along with physical fitness, they contribute to the mental well-being of people.”Meanwhile, department officials said that they have allocated a budget to promote open-air fitness centres, yoga classes, and alternatives, keeping in mind the growing burden of non-communicable diseases in society.Open-air gyms have been set up in public places, and the public can use them free of charge. Apart from setting up outdoor gyms, imparting training to communities and school students and promoting healthy lifestyles to reduce the major risk factors associated with non-communicable diseases, Thapa said.The department, which has already set up open-air fitness centres at the headquarters of all seven provinces, plans to set up 10 more such centres in the upcoming fiscal year. Several local units also have set up such facilities in their areas. \nIn a bid to address the problem of malnutrition in children under five, the Ministry of Health and Population has started imparting training to nurses and paramedics serving in Lumbini, Karnali, and Sudurpaschim provinces.Officials hope that a week-long training programme will help lessen the existing problems of malnutrition in those provinces.“Imparting training to combat malnutrition in small children is our nationwide programme, which we have started from Lumbini, Karnali and Sudurpaschim provinces,” said Lila Bikram Thapa, chief of Nutrition Section at the Family Welfare Division under the Department of Health Services. “Along with imparting training to health workers, we will also launch an awareness drive to improve exclusive breastfeeding practices.”Malnutrition is considered a silent health crisis in Nepal. The country has made significant progress in reducing stunting among children under five, which decreased from 57 percent in 2001 to 25 percent in 2022, according to the Nepal Demographic and Health Survey-2022.The report showed some improvement in the country’s overall nutrition status, but progress is not the same in all provinces.More than 16 percent of the children under five years in Lumbini Province are found to be suffering from wasting—the most immediate, visible, and life-threatening form of malnutrition.Wasting, a debilitating disease that causes muscle and fat tissues to waste away among children under five, decreased from 11 percent in 2001 to eight percent in 2022.Wasting or low weight for one’s height in children, if not treated properly and on time, is associated with a higher mortality risk, according to the World Health Organisation.The report shows that exclusive breastfeeding has been continuously declining, from 70 percent in 2011 to 56 percent last year. Health officials said that studies show that more educated and well-off mothers are less likely to exclusively breastfeed their babies.According to the report, the proportion of children who are bottle-fed rises with increasing mothers’ education, from 12 percent among those whose mothers have no education to 49 percent among those whose mothers have more than a secondary education. Use of a bottle with a nipple is the highest in the highest wealth quintile at 46 percent and lowest in the lowest quintile at 11 percent.Likewise, the proportion of children who are bottle-fed is higher in urban areas, 26 percent, than in rural areas, 15 percent. The use of a bottle with a nipple is lowest in Karnali Province at 11 percent, in Madhesh Province at 12 percent, and the highest in Bagmati Province at 43 percent.Exclusive breastfeeding is the highest in Sudurpaschim and Karnali provinces—74 percent each—and the lowest in Lumbini Province—36 percent.“We have allocated the nutrition budget to launch a nationwide awareness drive about the importance of exclusive breastfeeding in the upcoming fiscal year,” said Thapa. “We have also designated a nutrition focal person at every local unit who is tasked to discourage practices of promoting replacement feeding.”The report also showed that bottle-feeding practices started in health facilities. It showed that 22 percent of children born in a health facility receive mixed milk feeding (breast milk and fresh, packaged, or powdered animal milk or infant formula), as compared with 12 percent of those born at home. Bottle feeding is not recommended, as the nipple on a feeding bottle is susceptible to contamination and increases the risk of diseases among children, according to the World Health Organisation.Health ministry officials hoped that training for nurses and paramedics would help lessen bottle-feeding practices in health facilities.Doctors say breastfeeding should continue for the first two years or beyond, as breast milk lowers children’s risk of illness, promotes their recovery during illness, and remains an important source of nutrients for healthy growth and development.According to them, longer durations of breastfeeding have many health benefits for women, including reduced risks of certain breast and ovarian cancers and diabetes.Nepal had committed to increasing the exclusive breastfeeding rate to more than 90 percent by 2030, but the rate declined from 70 percent in 2011 to 66 percent in 2016 and to 56 percent in 2022. \nThe Stonewall Riots (1969) led to the creation of safe spaces like Inclusive Galaxy Restaurant in Nepal, providing LGBTQIA+ individuals a place to exist openly and access community and support.\nNepali chef Aditya Mishra, after staging at Michelin-starred restaurants, started his supper club 'The Sewing Tin' to promote Nepali cuisine in New York, winning the James Beard Foundation National Scholars Scholarship in 2023.\nCeleus Baral, a student and baker, runs Bakeleus online and at The Yellow House, offering baked goods incorporating her environmental science background and fostering a connection to nature through baking.\nPotatoes, widely consumed in Nepal, are a versatile, nutrient-rich crop with diverse varieties that offer various health benefits, and despite imports and popular processed forms like chips and fries, the vegetable remains a staple especially in mountainous regions due to its adaptability to varying climatic conditions.\nChicken eggs are a nutritious food source, rich in vitamins, minerals, and protein, offering benefits such as weight loss, reduced blood pressure, and protection against infections.\n“How much oxygen do you have for the summit?”I think this is the kind of question a film producer would ask. But when you're on the mountain, the answer is never clear.I have worked for a long time in the film industry and different art areas, especially photography and engraving.Working in various fields and drawing inspiration from them has become a new normal for me. I have made this approach my way of life without even realising it.I took responsibility for producing the last movie I worked on and shot the behind-the-scenes footage for a documentary. By doing so, I witnessed the entire shooting process and the journey of a movie.In the snowy highlands of Turkey, we had to endure the consequences of the changing climate to shoot ‘About Dry Grasses’, directed by Nuri Bilge Ceylan. The highlands used to be snowy in January, but by the time we got there in the same month, there was no snow. Nature was changing. It was responding to what was happening—to what humanity had done to it. In the end, it snowed, and we shot the intense snow scenes we wanted. But since most of our days were sunny, unlike what the director wanted, we had to shoot in the sunset and sunrise hours. As crew members, we spent many days waiting for the sun to set.Production requires creating opportunities, finding solutions, and being creative for a work of art to come true. For this, patience, endurance, calmness, and timing are necessary. On the other hand, nature wanted us to listen to it and wait for the right time.During that time, I witnessed many of nature's lessons. For example, I experienced extreme cold for the first time. We endured temperatures ranging from -33 degrees to +55 degrees. By listening to nature, surrendering to its forces, and working within its limits, we managed to persevere.No matter how much you prepare or plan during the pre-production phase, if you are working in nature, remember that nature will always have the final say.The film was completed, released, and connected with audiences. Its success at Cannes 2023 was followed by my trip to the North Pole for my project. I returned with a mix of wonderful developments, joys, and challenges. During this process, I experienced life and death, happiness and sadness, losses and awards.I realised the value of being able to breathe comfortably a few days after my father's chemotherapy ended. Just a few days earlier, he had said, \"Well done, my daughter. I'm glad you went!\" All the anxiety and hard work, filled with fears at the beginning, were finally behind me.Before going to Everest, when I was on the verge of giving up, defeated by my fears, I remembered my father's words. Everest reminded me of what he said while struggling to breathe, adding a turning point to my life.What does it mean to say ‘life’s turning point?’ How many turning points can there be in life?Who am I, and what am I doing in this world? How well do I know my own limits? Can I find answers to these big questions? These thoughts sparked my dream of journeying to Everest. Now, after returning, I can say that it turned my life around.“How much oxygen do you need for the summit?” sounds more like “How much do you need to hold on to life?” How many reasons do you find that give meaning to your life, keep you alive, and allow you to breathe? How much can you endure in the face of obstacles, and can you keep believing that a solution will eventually come your way?Can these questions be separated from the idea of measuring and assessing something, from learning its quantity and financial value? Can everything be known with certainty? Should the journey be fully understood in advance, with all its promises laid out? Should it be viewed like a purchase with a price tag, asking, “Is this journey worth this much?”I had never trekked before and had no climbing experience. I had lived at sea level my entire life and had never been to a high altitude.However, this journey was not only about the physical climb but also an inner discovery. After losing my father to lung cancer, his breathing difficulties taught me the fragility of breath, life, and existence. I also mentally prepared myself for the physical challenges I might face. Despite all my concerns, could this journey help me understand the cycle of life and the resilience of the soul?So, how could I make this trek possible? How could I land in Nepal? Despite all the economic difficulties and the many things I felt needed organising, I did my best and believed in it.Since I was embarking on this journey, I felt I should share about my travels and inspire others.Starting with photography, cinema, and engraving, which are already integral parts of my life, I dreamed of documenting and sharing the inspiring aspects of this journey.After months of correspondence and dreaming, it all came true. Finally, I embarked on the journey with the goal of creating photographs, engravings, and documentaries. I learned a great deal from my travels in Nepal, from the people I met, and from every moments I witnessed. I felt incredibly fortunate to have been able to honour my father’s memory with the peace and serenity I experienced in the Himalayas.During my 15-day journey to Everest Base Camp, I encountered nature’s masterpieces at every turn. As concerns like “How will I endure?” and “How will I finish?” started to weigh on me, the mountains suddenly parted with the clouds and gazed down at me.It was amazing to witness the appearance of ‘Gods’ that I had never seen before, in such immense size and in such a close, awe-inspiring manner beside me during that silent walk.As someone who came from one of the most crowded cities in the world, Istanbul, while I struggled with my daily questions and uncertainties, trying to control everything, they stood there calmly, as if answering me.They were just there—before and after.My guide, Lakhpa Sherpa, always reminded me not to worry about how high we were, how long it would take to reach our accommodation, or what the weather would be like. He encouraged me to live in the moment, and he was right.He advised me to focus on my breathing, not to get thirsty, to eat enough, and to appreciate the extraordinary beauty of the journey. In the mountains, plans dissolve and each moment is embraced as it comes.All the good wishes, prayers, and everything encountered along the way were for the journey itself. The mountain was full of life, secrets, and everything I had wondered about.This 15-day journey to Everest Base Camp was a solo adventure, yet I wouldn't have been able to complete it without my guide, Lhakpa, and my porter. Additionally, I was fortunate enough to experience the hospitality, generosity, and honesty at Trekkers Paradise, which organised the entire journey and provided guidance.I witnessed how dedication and sincerity are crucial in completing a journey safely and healthily. Ghanshyam Sharma, from Trekkers Paradise and Sauraj Jhingan, a climber who summited the Everest in 2018, shared their experiences with me during the journey.They experienced the 2015 earthquake while they were at the Everest Base Camp.As a filmmaker, their role as actors, and attention to detail played a significant role in bringing my dream photography and documentary project to life.The sponsors of my journey were Turkish Airlines, The North Face, Apple, Canon, and Stanley. My supporters include Oscar International College and Nepal Film Campus. Throughout the journey, I shared many experiences, memories, and countless photos and images with my students.On my way back home after 21 days, I celebrated my birthday on the plane. From the right window, the Himalayas bid me farewell. I felt like I had opened a new chapter in my life, and I was certain that I would return.I had made many friends and memories in Nepal.For now, I will be working on a documentary and preparing for a photography and engraving exhibition titled ‘My Soul Beyond the Mountain’.To the Himalayas: This summer was spent with you, but we will meet again soon. \nA group of journalists embarked on a five-day tour of Sri Lanka, exploring its rich cultural heritage, religious sites, natural landscapes, and economic recovery in the wake of financial challenges.\nMundhum Trek in Koshi province in the eastern part of Nepal is a new cultural walking trail. It passes through several indigenous ethnic villages and landscapes in Khotang and Bhojpur districts. This trail goes up to an elevation of 4,200 metres to the viewpoint of Silchung Peak and takes one through the settlements of the Kirati people. This route starts from Diktel Bazaar and passes through beautiful settlements like Chakhewa, Rawa Dhap, Salpa Bhanjyang, Silchung and Hanspokhari before ending in Bhojpur. There are some hotels in Diktel but trekkers are advised to carry tents. The trail offers panoramic views of most of the eight-thousanders, including Everest, Lhotse, Makalu, Cho Oyu and Kanchenjunga mountains. The spring season, March through May, is highly recommended for the trek.Janaki Mandir Janaki Mandir at Janakpur in Madhesh province was constructed in 1874 and is a blend of Mughal and local architecture. The temple is a three-storey building and has 60 rooms, making it the largest temple in Nepal. Pilgrims flock here by the thousands to pay homage to Janaki Mandir—Janaki being the other name of Sita, the daughter of King Janak. The temple houses an idol of Sita which was found near Ayodhya, the kingdom of Ram. The marriage anniversary of Lord Ram and Sita is celebrated in Janakpur every year on Vivaha Panchami, which falls in December. In the southwest corner of Janaki Mandir is the Vivaha Mandap, which has been built at the site where the marriage of Ram and Sita is said to have taken place. Another well-known temple in the vicinity is Ram Mandir, which is built in pagoda style and is hence different from the other temples in Janakpur that generally bear resemblance to Mughal architecture. It houses a female statue, said to be of Yogamaya, which has the reputation of being one of the most beautiful images of female forms in Nepal. Other holy sites of interest include the Laxman Temple, Sankat Mochan Temple and Hanuman Temple.Kuri Village, Kalinchok Kuri village, a popular tourist destination around 150 km from Kathmandu, lies at an altitude of 3,842 metres above sea level in Kalinchowk of Dolakha district, in Bagmati province. People visit the place to enjoy the snow during the winter besides the mesmerising landscapes and splendid panoramic view of the Himalayan range. Kalinchok gets snow mainly at the end of December and the snowfall continues till the end of February or mid-March. When there is snow, it is difficult for jeeps, buses and cars to reach the top of Kuri village. Chains are wrapped around the wheels of vehicles and specially modified jeeps with highly experienced drivers are used to carry visitors. There are several hotels and restaurants in the area. The road up to Kuri has also improved over the years.Annapurna Base Camp Annapurna Base Camp trek, in Gandaki province, makes for a picturesque journey that takes you to the foothills of the Annapurna South, up to 4,130 metres above sea level. The five-day trek (seven days for slow walkers) offers rich cultural diversities, typical Nepali villages and the flora and fauna nestled at the foothills of Annapurna. The distance from Pokhara to Annapurna Base Camp is approximately 81 kilometres. It is among the shortest and most budget-friendly treks in Nepal. For Nepalis, lodging costs around $5 to $10 per day. For foreigners, the overall cost of the trek ranges from $800 to $1500 on average per person. Annapurna Base Camp trek can be done at any time throughout the year as each season offers a different trekking experience. The ideal time for the trek depends on your weather preferences and what you expect from it. However, autumn (September to October) and spring (March to May) are considered the two best seasons for the trek, as the days at the time are warm and bright with clear skies.Bardiya National Park Bardiya National Park, located in the southern Tarai belt of Lumbini province, is home to one of the most elusive and majestic animals on earth—the Royal Bengal Tiger. The park, which covers an area of 968 square kilometres, is considered one of the most important protected areas in the country. It is a prime destination for those looking to catch a glimpse of a tiger. A bit of luck and patience will offer a good chance to see the Bengal Tiger. The jungle safari also offers one the opportunity to spot Asian elephants and the greater one-horned rhinoceros. The rare Gangetic river dolphins are occasionally spotted on rafting trips along the Geruwa River, the eastern channel of the Karnali river. Besides, visitors can enjoy the homestays and explore local Tharu culture. The right time to visit the park is from mid-September to mid-December and mid-February to May.Khaptad National Park Khaptad National Park in Sudurpaschim province is a protected area in the far western region. It stretches over four districts of Bajhang, Bajura, Achham and Doti and ranges in elevation from 1,400 to 3,300 metres. The park can be visited throughout the year. Trekkers are advised to bring their tents, food and other supplies. The Nepal Tourism Board says of late, social media has been increasingly influencing Nepali travellers to go to Khaptad. Since the far-flung Khaptad National Park is still offbeat for many travellers, the area remains pristine and fresh. The seasons of spring (March-May) and autumn (October-November) are the ideal times to visit the park. The temperature ranges from 10°c to 20°c offering pleasant trekking weather. The monsoon begins in June and lasts until September and during this time, roads often become muddy and slippery. From December to February, winter brings snow and chilling winds to the park.Limi Valley \nThe author, after a journey, returns to his hometown, Phidim, where he witnesses its transformation from a rural town to an urban center, while acknowledging its challenges and the departure of its residents.\nAmid the bustling city of Lucknow, the majestic Bara Imambara stands as a testament to architectural brilliance, with its iconic Rumi Darwaza, Asafi Mosque, gravity-defying Asafi Hall, enigmatic Bhool Bhulaiyaa, panoramic rooftop views, and the intriguing Shahi Baoli with its CCTV-like well.\nJames Rodriguez, winner of the Golden Boot at the 2014 World Cup, set up two goals in Colombia's 2-1 victory over Paraguay in their Copa America opener.\nSpain clinched their third Group B victory with a 1-0 win over Albania, showcasing a strong bench and securing their place in the knockout stages of Euro 2024.\nMultiple powerful explosions set a lithium battery factory on fire in South Korea on Monday, killing 22 workers, most of them Chinese nationals, as it burned out of control for nearly six hours, fire officials said.The blaze ripped through a factory run by primary battery manufacturer Aricell in Hwaseong, an industrial cluster southwest of the capital Seoul. It was eventually largely extinguished.Eighteen Chinese workers and one Laotian were among the dead. The nationality of the remaining deceased worker was not yet confirmed, fire official Kim Jin-young told reporters, citing information from company officials.The blaze began at 10:31 a.m. (0131 GMT) after a series of battery cells exploded inside a warehouse with some 35,000 units, Kim said. What had triggered the explosion remains unclear, he said.A Reuters journalist saw firefighters moving up to six bodies out of the factory. Due to the intensity of the blaze, rescuers were finding it difficult to identify the dead, Kim said.Two people were being treated for major burns, officials at the scene said.Live TV footage showed firefighters spraying the damaged steel and concrete building. Parts of the upper level had collapsed, and large chunks of the building looked like they had been blown out into the street by explosions.Aerial footage showed massive white smoke clouds billowing from the structure and explosions rolling through the building.Kim Jae-ho, Fire and Disaster Prevention professor at Daejeon University, said the fire had probably spread too quickly for workers to escape.“Battery materials such as nickel are easily flammable,” he said. “So often, there is not enough time to respond, compared to a fire caused by other materials.”President Yoon Suk Yeol visited the scene of the accident later on Monday. Interior Minister Lee Sang-min called on the local authorities to take steps to prevent any hazardous chemicals from contaminating the surrounding area.Established in 2020, Aricell makes lithium primary batteries for sensors and radio communication devices. It has 48 employees, according to its latest regulatory filing and its Linkedin profile.Calls to Aricell offices were unanswered.The company is not listed on South Korea’s stock market but is majority owned by S-Connect, according to the Aricell regulatory filing. S-Connect is registered on the junior Kosdaq index and its shares closed down 22.5%.Park Chul-wan at Seojeong University said Aricell is known to use extremely toxic material, which could explain the high death toll.“The fact that there were so many casualties when this was on only the second floor is because of the toxic materials and not so much because of burns,” he said.South Korea has made efforts to improve its safety record after several past accidents, many of which have been blamed on negligence.Each year dozens of workers are killed in industrial accidents, which prompted parliament to pass a law aimed at punishing the executives of a company in the event of a fatal accident with possible jail terms.South Korea is also home to major producers of lithium-ion batteries that power electric vehicles (EVs) and the world’s fifth largest automakers, Hyundai Motor Group, which are making a push to shift away from internal combustion cars to EVs. \nRussian guided bombs shattered an apartment building in Ukraine’s second-largest city on Saturday, killing three people, injuring 52 and prompting President Volodymyr Zelenskiy to call for more help to deal with the growing threat of such weapons.Pictures posted online showed parts of the five-storey apartment building in ruins, with windows smashed, balconies wrecked and rubble strewn about a crater on the ground.Prosecutors in Ukraine’s eastern Kharkiv region put the casualty toll at three dead and 52 injured in the mid-afternoon attack, including three injured children. Regional Governor Oleh Syniehubov said four of those hurt were in serious condition.“This Russian terror through guided bombs must be stopped and can be stopped,” Zelenskiy wrote on Telegram.“We need strong decisions from our partners to enable us to stop the Russian terrorists and Russian military aviation right where they are.”Later, in his nightly video address, Zelenskiy said Russian forces had used more than 2,400 guided bombs on Ukrainian targets in June alone, with about 700 aimed at Kharkiv.He said after US Congress gave delayed approval of a big aid package in April, Ukraine's replenished arms supplies had reduced the devastation and frequency of missile attacks and the same had to be done now to fend off these bombs.“The significant reduction in Russian missile terror against Kharkiv and the region proves it is entirely possible to secure our cities and communities from Russian bombs,” he said.Ukraine, he said, needed promised military aid packages “without delay so that the agreements we reached with (US) President Biden can be realised.”Ukraine and the US signed a 10-year bilateral security agreement this month aimed at bolstering Ukraine's defense against Russia and getting Ukraine closer to NATO membership.Russia has relied increasingly on relatively inexpensive guided bombs, dropped from a distance and involving fewer risks for its forces.Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022 and has advanced slowly through Donetsk region in the east, capturing a string of villages since seizing the key industrial town of Avdiivka more than three months ago.It launched a cross-border incursion north of Kharkiv last month, though Zelenskiy says the situation there has stabilised.In the latest bomb attack, Mayor Ihor Terekhov said there had been four strikes on Kharkiv.Regional governor Syniehubov said rescue work was proceeding at the building, which housed a store on the ground floor.Kharkiv Police Chief Serhiy Bolvinov told public broadcaster Suspilne that three floors had collapsed, but he believed no one was trapped under the rubble.Kharkiv lies about 30 km (20 miles) from the border with Russia. The city of 1.3 million people has frequently been targeted in Russian attacks during nearly 28 months of war.Moscow denies deliberately targeting civilians but thousands have been killed and injured in the war. \nA shooter opened fire at an Arkansas supermarket on Friday, killing three civilians and wounding 10 other people, including two police officers, Arkansas State Police said.The suspect was also wounded in a shootout with police, Arkansas State Police Director Mike Hagar told reporters.The shooting occurred at the Mad Butcher grocery in Fordyce, a town of 3,200 people about 70 miles (112 km) south of Little Rock.“Unfortunately, we can confirm that 11 innocent civilians were shot, and three of those are deceased. Two law enforcement officers were injured in the exchange of gunfire. The suspect was also shot and taken into custody,” Hagar said. He did not explain the circumstances of the shooting or take questions.The wounded police officers and the suspect were expected to survive, he said.Civilian injuries ranged from non-life-threatening to extremely critical, he said.Governor Sarah Huckabee Sanders said on social media platform X that she was briefed on the incident.“I am thankful to law enforcement and first responders for their quick and heroic action to save lives. My prayers are with the victims and all those impacted by this horrific incident,” she said. \nSummaryIsraeli strikes kill at least 45 Palestinians in GazaForces pound southern city of RafahIsrael says forces carrying out ‘precise, intelligence-based’ actionsIsraeli military finds militants’ tunnels in Rafah, it saysIsraeli forces pounded Rafah in southern Gaza on Friday, as well as other areas across the enclave, killing at least 45 Palestinians as troops engaged in close-quarter combat with Hamas militants, residents and Israel’s military said.Residents said the Israelis appeared to be trying to complete their capture of Rafah, which borders Egypt and has been the focus of an Israeli assault since early May.Tanks were forcing their way into the western and northern parts of the city, having already captured the east, south and centre.Firing from planes, tanks and ships off the coast caused more people to flee the city, which a few months ago was sheltering more than a million displaced people, most of whom have now relocated again.The Gaza health ministry said at least 25 Palestinians had been killed in Mawasi in western Rafah and 50 wounded. Palestinians said a tank shell hit a tent housing displaced families.“Two tanks climbed a hilltop overseeing Mawasi and they sent balls of fire that hit the tents of the poor people displaced in the area,” one resident told Reuters over a chat app.The Israeli military said that the incident was under review. “An initial inquiry conducted suggests that there is no indication that a strike was carried out by the IDF (Israel Defence Forces) in the Humanitarian Area in Al-Mawasi,” it said.Earlier, the military said its forces were conducting “precise, intelligence-based” actions in the Rafah area, where troops were involved in close-quarter combat and had located tunnels used by militants.Over the past week, the military said, troops targeted a university that served as a Hamas headquarters from which militants fired on soldiers and found weapons and barrel bombs. It did not name the university.In the central Gaza area of Nusseirat, the military said soldiers killed dozens of militants over the past week and found a weapons depot containing mortar bombs and military equipment belonging to Hamas.Some residents said the Israeli onslaught on Rafah had intensified in the previous two days and that the sounds of explosions and gunfire had hardly stopped.“Last night was one of the worst nights in western Rafah: Drones, planes, tanks, and naval boats bombarded the area. We feel the occupation is trying to complete the control of the city,” said Hatem, 45, reached by text message.“They are taking heavy strikes from the resistance fighters, which may be slowing them down.”STRIKES ON KHAN YOUNIS AND GAZA CITYMore than eight months into the war in Gaza, Israel’s advance is now focused on the two last areas its forces had yet to seize: Rafah on Gaza’s southern edge and the area surrounding Deir al-Balah in the centre.“The entire city of Rafah is an area of Israeli military operations,” Ahmed Al-Sofi, the mayor of Rafah, said in a statement carried by Hamas media on Friday.“The city is living through a humanitarian catastrophe and people are dying inside their tents because of Israeli bombardment.”Sofi said no medical facility was functioning in the city, and that remaining residents and displaced families lacked the minimum daily needs of food and water.Palestinian and UN figures show that fewer than 100,000 people may have remained in the far western side of the city, which had been sheltering more than half of Gaza’s 2.3 million people before the Israeli assault began in early May.In nearby Khan Younis, an Israeli air strike on Friday killed three people, including a father and son, medics said.In parallel, Israeli forces continued a new push back into some Gaza City suburbs in the north of the enclave, where they fought with Hamas-led militants.On Friday, an Israeli air strike on a Gaza City municipal facility killed five people, including four municipal workers, the territory’s Civil Emergency Service said. Rescue teams were searching the rubble for more missing victims.In the nearby Beach camp, an Israeli air strike on a house killed at least seven people, medics said.Palestinian health officials said at least 45 Palestinians were killed in Israeli strikes across Gaza on Friday.The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) said its Gaza office was damaged when heavy-calibre projectiles landed nearby, in an area where hundreds of displaced Palestinians are living in tents.“This grave security incident is one of several in recent days; previously stray bullets have reached ICRC structures,” the organization said in a post on X on Friday.“We decry these incidents that put the lives of humanitarians and civilians at risk.”Israel’s ground and air campaign was triggered when Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel on Oct. 7, killing around 1,200 people and seizing more than 250 hostages, according to Israeli tallies.The offensive has left Gaza in ruins, killed more than 37,400 people, according to Palestinian health authorities, and left nearly the entire population homeless and destitute.The United Nations said on Friday it is Israel’s responsibility - as the occupying power in the Gaza Strip - to restore public order and safety in the Palestinian territory so humanitarian aid can be delivered, amid warnings of imminent famine. \nNepal’s book market is no stranger to the popular Bangladeshi-Swedish writer Taslima Nasrin. Almost all of her books have been translated into Nepali, but Nasrin herself says that they are all unauthorised translations. “All books [Nepali translations] are pirated versions,” Nasrin told the Post in a Whatsapp conversation. Nasrin, who is currently in exile in India after facing death threats in Bangladesh following the publication of her novel Lajja (Shame), said that she or her publishers have never allowed anyone the right to translate her books into Nepali. “I don’t know of any such Nepali publishers. No one asked for permission and no one has paid [me] royalty.”Translating and publishing books without permission from authors or publishers is a punishable crime. But Nepal’s book market is full of such unauthorised translations and prints of books written by the who’s who of the world literature. Such endeavours haven’t just hurt the authors but also the readers, says Ajit Baral, publisher of the Kathmandu-based Fineprint publication. “These translations are poor,” Baral says. “Tomes with 1200–1300 pages have been trimmed to 200–300 pages. An example is the biography of Bill Clinton.”Another popular book that has seen unauthorised Nepali translation is the biography of Steve Jobs by Walter Isaacson.“We have no official deal in place for a [Nepali] translation of Steve Jobs,” Peppa Mignone, associate agent of the CAA, the translation authority of the biography, said in an email interview with the Post.The book’s Nepali translation is published by Panchpokhari Publication House. The translated book identifies the translator thus: “Achyut Koirala, who has a master’s in English literature, is primarily a journalist. He is currently affiliated with Nagarik daily. He keeps a close tab on international history, politics and culture and has written scripts and dialogues for half a dozen Nepali films. He has published over a dozen non-fiction books.”Koirala, who admits to the unauthorised translation, claims that he hasn’t just translated the book but has also done ‘creative writing’ with it.‘Rich Dad Poor Dad’, written by Robert Kiyosaki and Sharon Lechter, is among the books that’s perennially on the bestseller list across the world. Upon investigation, the Post found three Nepali translations of the book—all unauthorised. One of them is translated by Dilip Kumar Shrestha and published by the same firm, the Panchpokhari Publication House. Another Nepali iteration of the book is published by Book For All publication and translated by Kopila MD. Yet another Nepali version is translated by one Sudheer Dixit and published by Plata Publication, Kathmandu.In an email conversation with the Post, Ronson Taylor, who oversees the international rights at The Rich Dad Company, said, “At this point in time, we do not have a relationship with an established publisher in the [Nepali] language market. If there are any Rich Dad Poor Dad books currently for sale in the Nepali market, they are pirated.”Basanta Thapa, a writer and translator, says that many books are being translated of late to make easy money. “But how would the quality of these unauthorised translations be!” Thapa wonders. “Readers who haven’t read the original wouldn’t know the faults in the translated versions.” Thapa says that any translator worth his salt aims to ‘recreate’ a book and it takes much work to do that.Taslima’s books are the major victimsTaslima’s memoir Uttal Hawa has been translated into Nepali as ‘Sangharsha’, literally Struggle, and is published by Khoji Publication House. Even though the book in its cover claims that it is an authorised translation from the English version Wild Wind, it is a pirated one. The book is translated by Bikash Basnet and edited by Bhogiraj Chamling. A revised version of the book is edited by Sangeet Srota (Yam Bahadur Chhetri).The same publication house has also published the Nepali translation of the book’s sequel as ‘Prem ra Jeevan’. Publisher Sushil Chalise says that while he is aware that one needs to receive permission from the author or the publisher to translate a book, his efforts to contact Taslima were unsuccessful. Therefore, he had published the version the translator made available to him. Translator Basnet, too, admits he translated the book without Taslima’s permission. “About a decade back, we didn’t know how to ask for permission,” he said.Nepal has the Copyright Act (2002) in place. Before it, there was the The Patent, Design and Trade Mark Act, 2022 (1965) that included intellectual property in its 2006 revision. Even the Muluki Ain (Civil Code) of 1910 BS had a provision about copyright. Moreover, it goes without saying that translating somebody else’s work without permission is immoral.Likewise, Indigo Ink Pvt Ltd has published a Nepali translation of Taslima’s anthology of essays No Country for Women as ‘Aaimai ko Kunai Desh Chhaina’. The book is translated by Krishna Giri and edited by Pramod Pradhan. “I have no idea about the agreement between the publisher and translator,” Pradhan, who is also a children’s book writer, says. “I just copy-edited it upon request.”Bishnukumar Poudel, publisher of Indigo Ink, however, claims that he is still trying to take translation rights for the book. “We translated the book long ago,” he says. “We are still trying to get translation rights.”Indigo is also publishing unauthorised translations under its imprints All Book Store Pvt Ltd, Book for All and Plata Publication. It has published two versions of Rich Dad Poor Dad under those shadow imprints. But Plata Publication is not registered in the Company Registrar’s Office.Pradhan says that many foreign books have had unauthorised translations in Nepali and their quality is poor. Those books are translated not from the original language but from a second or third language, so these translations are bound to have problems, he says. “After I learned that those were unauthorised translations, I have stopped editing them,” Pradhan said.Indian author Shiv Khera’s You Can Win has been translated into Nepali by Bloomsbury India and has granted the distribution rights to Ekta Books. But the book’s unauthorised translations are also found in the market and they don’t even mention the name of the publisher and translator. What is interesting is they mention that it’d be illegal to republish the book, or an excerpt of it, without the author’s permission.The Nepali translation of the book, which was poorly written and rife with inaccuracies, had landed the publisher at court. After a complaint was filed at the District Court Kathmandu in 2066BS on the charge that the publisher violated the copyrights and economic rights, the court had issued a verdict on Mangsir 11 that year, charging a fine of Rs10,000, Rs20,000 and Rs30,000 to the defendants Netra Prasad Pokharel, Narayan Prasad Bhusal, and Bhagwati Risal and Bishnu Silwal, respectively.Baral, the Fineprint publisher, says that international publishers wouldn’t demand much for translation rights given Nepal’s small market, but Nepali publishers do not bother to reach out to them. “Publishers who put out unauthorised translations and sell them at 50 percent discount have troubled publishers like us,” he said.Fineprint has published authorised translated versions of books such as Leaving Microsoft to Change the World by John Wood, Healed by Manisha Koirala, and Hippie by Paulo Coelho. The publication house is also set to release the Nepali translation of Israeli historian Yuval Noah Harari’s bestseller Sapiens. Translated into Nepali by Dinesh Kafle, the book’s translation right was acquired at the cost of USD1300, Baral said. Likewise, the publication acquired the translation rights of Sadhguru’s Inner Engineering at IRS93,000, he added.Baral says that publication of unauthorised translations is an immoral and illegal work. “This phenomenon not just hampers Nepal’s fledgling book publishing industry but also tarnishes the country’s reputation in the global market,” Baral said.Thapa, the writer and translator, points out the lack of regulatory mechanisms in the country. “We don’t have an agency that regulates the quality of translations being done,” he says. “Nobody compares the translation with the original. We need a dedicated authority to enhance the quality of translation.” Universities, Nepal Academy and other stakeholders can play a role to uplift the translation sector, he adds.One’s pain, another’s pleasureWhen the author Suketu Mehta was travelling through Mumbai, a young man approached him with a handful of books while his vehicle was stuck in traffic. Brandishing Maximum City, written by none other than Mehta himself, the young man requested the author to buy a copy. Suketu leafed through the book and said, “This is a pirated copy and I’m the author of this book.” The youth wasn’t bothered and replied, “Okay, you can buy it at a discount.”This anecdote was shared to the Post by Mehta’s friend, the author and professor Amitava Kumar, in an email exchange.Most of these pirated books are imported into Nepal from India while the retailers of original books are finding themselves increasingly in trouble. “We sell original copies but many readers doubt us as well, given the ubiquity of pirated versions,” says Anjan Shrestha, operator of Education Book House, Jamal.Ramchandra Timothy, chair of Thapathali-based Ekta Books Pvt Ltd, said that the phenomenon of piracy has tarnished Nepal’s image internationally. “There was a time when Bangladesh would be known as ‘piracy king’,” he said. “Now there's a risk Nepal would take the crown.”As tax increases, so does piracyThe government decision to impose a 10 percent tax on book imports in fiscal year 2019-20 led to a proliferation of pirated book markets, booksellers say. After the decision, booksellers started to cut back on imports and that led to the entry of a new crop of pirated booksellers, a trader in Kathmandu says. But following widespread backlash, then finance minister Bishnu Paudel struck down the policy.“After the government’s decision, we stopped importing books for a while,” says Shrestha of Education Books. “The import of books went down for about two years. Then the pirates stepped in to fill the gap. It was about that time that pirated copies of biographies and memoirs of Obamas and Jai Shettys became omnipresent in the market.”Pirated copies of classics by Roald Dahl and JK Rowling also made an entry in the Nepali market. Then the phenomenon only saw a rise.Since the customs department does not levy duty on foreign books and also does not care to differentiate between the pirated and original copies, unauthorised books have found a safe haven in Nepali market.The government doesn’t levy any customs duty on books and newspapers published by foreign publishers abroad. The importers should only pay Rs565 at the customs points. But Nepali publishers have to pay 10 percent tax to import books printed in India.James Taylor, director of Communications and Freedom to Publish of the International Publishers Association, says that the government, publishers, writers and readers should join hands to control widespread piracy. “The government should realise that book publishing and reading culture contribute to the country’s economy as well,” he said, adding that the government should seize pirated books and close websites that sell pirated ebooks.Nandan Jha, executive vice chair of Penguin Random House India’s sales, production and business department, says that piracy has emerged as a big challenge for publishers of late and has harmed the authors, publishers, distributors, printers, readers and other stakeholders. “To confront piracy, all the stakeholders should launch a special joint effort,” Jha told the Post in an email exchange.Piracy has proliferated in the Nepali market to such an extent that the publishers of such books and unauthorised translations keep whatever ISBN numbers they like, often conflicting with other books, and still get off scot free. If scanned or searched on the internet, the ISBN number gives details on the author of the book, what the book is about, and its price, among others.Bijay Sharma, information officer at TU Library, says, “Keeping ISBN number at one’s will is illegal. If anyone files a complaint, we can punish them.”By the lawThe Muluki Ain-1910 BS had mandated that a publisher take permission of Gorkha Bhasa Prakashini Samiti before publishing any material. The Copyrights Act came into effect in 2022 BS and was amended in 2054 BS. In 2059 BS, a new Act was promulgated and it is still effective now. Authorities are currently working to amend the Act to give the registrar’s office more autonomy regarding copyright.According to the 2059 BS Act, copyright violations are considered government cases. In such cases, plaintiffs should file a complaint with the police. The Act’s clause 25 has various conditions that amount to violation of copyright. The Act’s subclause A says that if a publisher produces or copies material in writing or sound and sells or distributes it, it amounts to violation of copyright.Likewise, the Act’s clause 26 prevents selling of unauthorised material. The clause restricts the ‘importation of copies of work or sound recording, either made in a foreign country or sourced otherwise, into Nepal for business purpose shall not be permitted if preparation of such copies would be considered illegal if they were prepared in Nepal.’If anyone infringes upon protected rights, they are liable to punishment but the provision’s implementation remains lax.The law gives the authority to district court to take legal action against copyright violators.Advocate Parshuram Koirala says that if the government becomes more proactive, it can punish violators on the basis of the 2059 BS Act and thereby control the phenomenon of intellectual theft and copyright violations. “Creation is a crucial part of humanity’s benefit,” he says. “If intellectual property is not protected effectively, then there’d be no inspiration to create something.”Bal Bahadur Mukhiya, a professor at Nepal Law Campus, suggests the inclusion of rules about digital piracy in law, and also the clauses of various related international treaties and agreements that Nepal is part of.“In the US, a teacher or professor should pay a certain revenue even to photocopy a chapter of some text for teaching purposes,” Mukhiya says. “But in Nepal, those who photocopy an entire book and sell it go scot free.”(This report is prepared in collaboration with the Centre for Investigative Journalism, Nepal.) \nBharat Budha, chair of Putha Uttarganga Rural Municipality’s ward 10, knows that many youths from his village have made it to the United States via ‘tallo bato’—backdoor route—and that many are still on the way. He also knows that eight of them have been deported from the country and that they have lost a cumulative Rs45 million in the process. The deported youths say that they returned home empty-handed after facing unspeakable ordeals and lost Rs6 million each on average.The Tak village in Rukum East—a close-knit settlement of 425 houses—was considered the Maoists’ ‘base area’ during the insurgency. Village youths who reached the US through illegal routes and got deported have lost an estimated Rs40 million. The number of those who returned without completing the journey and the amount they lost remain unknown.To get to the US, the youths have taken loans at up to 36 percent interest per annum from their relatives and village landowners. In Tak village, at least one person each from half of the households has gone abroad, Budha said. “Youths started going to America about six-seven years ago,” he said. “If they could gather enough money, the whole village would try to go to the US.” Budha’s own son had reached the US illegally in 2017, spending Rs3.2 million.During the insurgency, outsize slogans of revolution would adorn the walls of houses in the village. Hoping for a better life, people from all walks of life helped out the Maoists. But now, village youths are paying the agents to illegally get to the US—a country that the Maoists used to call their ‘enemy’, an ‘imperialistic force’. This has cost the Tak village much and in multiple ways.Death of a dreamSome of the deported youths have chosen to flee the village altogether, burdened with debt and creditors’ pressure. At least five such families have already left, said a resident. The family of Ram Budha was one of them. On April 28, 2015, Ram, who had returned to Nepal after working in Malaysia for eight years, took the illegal route to the US. He travelled through arduous trails for months and finally arrived in the country. Upon reaching the country, he was detained and had to stay at the detention camp for 27 months. When his refugee application was rejected, he was deported to Nepal in mid-December 2019. He lost Rs4.5 million in the process. He now owes over Rs6 million to creditors. “After the creditors began to put pressure on me, I couldn’t live in the village peacefully,” said Ram, who currently runs a vegetable farm in Tarakeshwar, Kathmandu.While those who got to the US through illegal routes and fortunately got refugee status there narrate their stories with pride, those who have been deported or returned from half-way have tragic tales to tell.Nanda Kala Gharti, who lives in a small stone house on the upper flank of Tak village, spends her days in melancholy. Her husband, Dhanlal, had chosen to take the illegal route to the US, and Nanda Kala, a mother of four, is living with the repercussions of his decision. Dhanlal had got into the US after a six-month long arduous journey and was detained immediately. He had to spend four years in the detention camp, before he was deported to Nepal. He had already lost Rs6 million.Nanda Kala said they now have an insurmountable crisis in their hands. Pointing to her son, she exclaimed, “When will he grow up, go abroad and pay back the loans!”Dhanlal himself tried to go to Croatia once and spent 15 days in Kathmandu for the process. But after he was turned down, he returned home dejected. “Now we will submit the passport to another agent [for Dhanlal’s trip abroad],” Nanda Kala said. “There’s no point staying here.”Stories that echo each otherThe situation in Sisne Rural Municipality is similar to that of Putha Uttarganga. Here, one can hear plenty of stories of those who have tried to go to the US and those who are fighting refugee cases there. Krishna Regmi, chair of the rural municipality, personally knows seven people who have been deported from the US.Gangaram Khadka, a resident of Sisne-3, runs a bee and chicken farm. Like other young men in his village, Khadka had headed off to the US via an illegal route on 27 March, 2018. He had reached the US via the New Delhi-Moscow-Barcelona-Bogota-Panama-Costa Rica-Nicaragua-Honduras-Guatemala-Mexico route. When he finally arrived in the US, he was detained and had to spend 11 months in detention. He was deported on 15 March, 2019. He had handed over Rs3.2 millions to the agent and spent Rs2 million to fight the case to become a refugee. “It’s not possible for me to pay back the loan while working in Nepal,” he said. “I aim to pay back some interest and head off abroad again.”For six months after Khadka was deported, he had anxiety and headache, he said, adding the three people from his village who were deported like him are also struggling with their mental health.Tikaram Pun, a 40-year-old resident of Bohora village in Musikot-4, is also haunted by his past journey. In September 2017, he reached the US after crossing 17 countries with the help of organised human traffickers. Of the 41 people in his group, 31 were from Rukum East and Rukum West, he said. Pun, who was detained on arrival in the US, spent 24 months in a detention camp. His refugee application was also refused and so he was deported along with eight other Nepalis. “When I returned, I started having mental health problems. I still suffer from them,” he said. Pun is under pressure from creditors and relatives to pay back the Rs9.2 million loan he had taken for the task.Those who died on the wayA group of 10 Bangladeshis and seven Nepalis, including Rupak Bohora of Bafikot-3 in Rukum West, were on a mission to reach Costa Rica through Colombia, Caribbean Coast, Capuragana and Panama. But while they were crossing a sea, their boat capsized. As many as 12 died in the incident, including six Nepalis. Rupak’s wife, Geeta, learned about the incident only after six days, on 25 June, 2021.“I still don’t know what exactly happened,” said Geeta, who had been married off at age 19 and is now a mother of two daughters. The only thing she knows is that Rupak has died and she is now all alone. And that she has Rs5 million in loan taken for Rupak’s trip. She showed a picture of her husband on her phone to this scribe and said, “I only have memories.”Lack of political will and legal remediesThe concrete bridge over Chewang river is on the edge of Tak village. On the walls of the bridge are paintings of political theorists like Marx, Engels, Lenin, Stalin and Mao, and the iconic slogan, ‘Workers of the world, unite!’, below them. But the slogan appears to be at odds with life in the village. Given the phenomenon of illegal travels to the US through the help of organised human traffickers, the whole village appears to be emptying. Neither the local governments are concerned about the phenomenon nor are the political parties paying attention.Puniraj Gharti, chair of Putha Uttarganga Rural Municipality, said though the trend is worrying, there’s nothing he can do. “How could we stop them from making the trip when they are struggling to make a living in the village?” he said.Krishna Regmi, chair of Sisne Rural Municipality, said that the vicious cycle of poverty started after marijuana farming was banned in the country. Then the Maoist insurgency added to the woe, forcing youths to migrate. The signing of the peace agreement in 2006 didn’t herald any change in the economy either and youths are struggling to get jobs. Organised human traffickers are cashing in on this sorry state of affairs, Regmi said. “Meter byajis [usurious lenders] are also promoting this phenomenon,” he added.The phenomenon is equally rife in Dang’s Tulsipur and Ghorahi. Ramesh Kumar Pandey, chair of Ghorai-15, says that even though many heading to the US are swindled, no complaints are filed at the ward office. “Only those who attempt to go to Saudi Arabia or Qatar file the complaints,” he said.One can infer from Pandey’s statements that the families of such illegal travellers don’t want to publicise the ordeals of their family members. On the one hand, agents threaten them to not publicise the issue; on the other, they fear they themselves would be punished by law.According to the Anti-Human Trafficking Bureau, as many as 178 Nepalis, including 174 men, have been deported from the US in the five fiscal years after 2018-19. Of them, the highest 49 are from Rukum while 37 are from Dang. The data doesn’t include those who returned after making it to the half-way or those who have been fighting the legal battle in the US for refugee status. But this data is enough to show that many such youths are from the ‘base areas’ of the Maoist insurgency.SSP Jeevan Shrestha, chief of the bureau, said that data on the number of such victims and the amounts they have spent is hard to collect since complaints are rarely filed with the police. “This is human trafficking but for a lack of law, we are still compelled to launch the cases as per Human Trafficking and Transportation (Control) Act 2074 BS,” Shrestha said. “The Act provides a maximum penalty of Rs250,000 for the offenders and 50 percent of that as compensation to the victims.” Without specific law, police also invoke the theft and organised crime act to punish the offenders, he added.On the one hand, police receive no complaints; on the other, the phenomenon sees no control.Bhaskar Gautam, a political scientist, says the rise in cases of human trafficking in the insurgency’s ‘base areas’ is due to the political system’s abject failure.While the Maoists raised issues related to livelihood, nationalism and a new kind of democracy to fuel their war machine, after the peace process, it is livelihoods that have been hit the hardest, Gautam said. “The traditional way of life and economy took a hit during the insurgency,” he said. “Developments after the peace process also failed to address that. What sprang up was organised human trafficking.”(Mahesh KC in Rukum East and Durgalal KC in Dang contributed to this report.)This report is prepared in collaboration with the Center for Investigative Journalism-Nepal. \nGyanumaya BK had been suffering from severe backaches for a while. The resident of Pokhara-15, BK visited the Metrocity Hospital in Srijanachowk seeking treatment five months ago. The 69-year-old, who works as a labourer, has already spent over Rs50,000 on follow-up checkups and medications.BK spent eight days in the hospital in January and has been paying off loans she had taken to pay her bills and for follow-up visits to the hospital. Had BK been aware of the Health Facility Operation Standards-2020, which private hospitals must adhere to, she wouldn’t have had to borrow money to pay her medical bills. As per the regulations, hospitals must set aside 10 percent of their total beds to the underprivileged and needy.“I didn’t know hospitals were required to provide free treatment to those who can’t afford hospital stays,” BK said. “But even if I did, I would have to fight to get the service as the hospital won’t willingly offer me the service.”The Pokhara-based 50-bed hospital’s Chief Executive Officer Gyan Prasad Aryal admits that his hospital does not adhere to the mandate. “We don’t have explicit information from the health ministry on the Health Facility Operation Standards-2020,” said Aryal. “Moving forward, we will follow the instructions.” The hospital authorities say they give a 10-15 percent discount on the final hospital bill as opposed to dedicating 10 percent of their beds and free treatment and medications to the less privileged. Hospitals with 15 beds come under the jurisdiction of the local units while those with up to 50 beds fall under the ambit of the Provincial Health Directorate. Likewise, the Provincial Health Ministry oversees health facilities with over 50 beds.However, no regulatory body has data on whether health facilities are following government rules, especially Health Facility Operation Standards-2020. But it is an open secret that most private hospitals in Pokhara are not following the regulations.Pokhara Municipality Health Department Officer Yadunath Baral, Kaski District Health Officer Bhim Prasad Poudel, and Province Health Director Khim Bahadur Khadka all admit that local hospitals disregard the regulations. “Our monitoring and inspection is also lax, that’s why most hospitals ignore the rules,” he said. He says lack of manpower hampers effective inspection. “Our manpower is enough to conduct inspections in other districts, but not in Kaski, which has many private hospitals,” he said. “We need more people for that”. According to Baral, although the hospitals claim to offer a certain discount on final bills to the needy, they are unable to show the record of the discounts provided. “The hospitals claim they give discounts, but most hospitals have not even been able to show us the proof,” said Khadka. “Legal actions should be taken against the hospitals that fail to submit a monthly report on the free services for the poor. More importantly, they must be liable for flouting government standards that aim to benefit the poor.” The Provincial Health Directorate also does not have any data on the directive’s implementation at hospitals with more than 50 beds.The department’s chief of health services Dr Ramesh KC says that they have been working on updating information of health services in the Gandaki region. “Hospitals have failed to submit their mandatory monthly reports. We will seek that information when they come for new permits or permit renewal,” KC said. There are 27 privately-owned hospitals within the Pokhara Metropolitan City and 39 in the Gandaki region. Bharatpur Metropolitan City in Chitwan in Bagmati Province is also called the ‘medical city’  as it is home to 23 private hospitals with a total of 1,200 beds. Additionally, there are multiple large-scale government hospitals and two medical colleges—Chitwan Medical College and College of Medical Sciences—that also provide medical services. Had the Health Facility Operation Standards-2020 been followed by the 23 private hospitals, 120 patients would have received free health services every year, according to Durgadutta Chapagain, chief of the Chitwan Health Office.“Although the hospitals claim they provide the services, none have been able to provide convincing proof. Instead, we found them giving such discounts to patients who are close to hospital operators,” said Chapagain. “Our department validates the permits for new health facilities and re-registrations for hospitals with a 25-bed capacity. We have asked such public health service providers to put up posters or stickers reading ‘Discounts for the needy’ on the hospital premises so that patients know what services they can get on discount.”Meanwhile, Bikram Adhikari, Secretary of the Private Hospitals Coordination Committee in Chitwan, claims that the regulations are impractical. “There are a few services that hospitals can provide free of cost. You cannot expect hospitals to provide all services for free. That’s why there is a need to amend the existing regulations,” said Adhikari.The monitoring bodies’ inaction and lackadaisical approach to ensuring that public health services are accessible and affordable to all makes private hospitals blatantly ignore government mandates.Bharatpur Metropolitan City’s Deputy Mayor Chitrasen Adhikari says that although the metropolis is aware that private hospitals must allocate 10 percent of their beds for free treatment of poor people, the metropolis administration has yet to devise a monitoring mechanism. “We have not taken any steps towards that end, but we will soon,” he said.Just like Pokhara and Chitwan, Biratnagar is also plagued with the same problem. There are 32 private hospitals currently in operation in the metropolis. Deepak Bhattarai, statistical officer at the municipality’s health office, asserts that none of the health facilities met the set requirements. A monthly report submitted by the Biratnagar-based Nobel Medical College and Teaching Hospital, which has 750 beds, stated that the hospital had provided the said concession to more than 400 patients. “However, the report did not clarify how many of the 400 patients were provided free hospital beds and the services that come along with the beds, and how many were given discounts on their hospital bills,” Bhattarai said. “We found that hospital reports also include concessions provided to patients who sought outpatient, emergency, and X-ray services.”The hospital’s director Narayan Dahal claims to be following all government instructions. He says 10 percent hospital beds are set aside for needy patients who are not charged any treatment fees, while 10 percent of service seekers also get discounts.Although the Biratnagar Metropolis has directed all health facilities under its jurisdiction to allocate free beds and provide free services to the needy, inform service seekers about the government-provided services, and submit a list of all patients who have received the services, the directive is ignored more often than followed. According to Bhattarai, medical establishments must get a letter from the local unit before making any upgrades or purchasing any equipment. “But the hospitals have been found presenting fake documents in order to acquire such permits,” he said. “The metropolis has refused such permits to 12 private hospitals in the current fiscal year.”Butwal Sub-Metropolitan City in the Lumbini Province has also taken no concrete step to ensure private hospitals adhere to Health Facility Operation Standards-2020. Despite having the authority to carry out inspections, the sub-metropolis’ apathy has deprived hundreds of needy patients of various government services. The sub-metropolis with 17 wards has more than two dozen big hospitals in the Butwal bazaar area itself. Not one of them adheres to the government’s health regulations. But the sub-metropolis is yet to monitor these hospitals. Yubraj Pandey, chief of Butwal Sub Metropolitan’s health department, says they have been unable to inspect medical institutes due to a lack of a proper set of rules.“I have just been transferred here. Discussions are underway to prepare legal requirements,” he said. Private hospitals in Butwal only began filing their reports two months ago after a joint meeting, informs Chief of the Sub Metropolitan’s Education and Health Department Mitramani Khanal. Twenty-year-old Suraj BK of Sarawal Rural Municipality-2 in West Nawalparasi got into a motorcycle accident on April 26. He suffered injuries on both his legs and was taken to Zenus Hospital and Research Centre in Butwal. Suraj was handed a bill of Rs 70,000 for treatment but he did not have the money to clear the bill and sought the hospital’s help. “The hospital refused to provide any discount. They in fact refused to discharge me. I got my discharge papers only four days later after I paid almost Rs 100,000,” he said. “I had to get a loan to pay the hospital bills as my father, who is a farmer, did not have that kind of money.”Dr Sharda Singh, the hospital director, said Suraj did not qualify for a discount as he did not have a recommendation letter from the local unit. “Patients have to get a recommendation to avail of free services at private hospitals but Suraj could not bring one,” she said. “I was in the hospital bed for four days. I could not have secured a recommendation from the local unit in that state,” said Suraj. Ishwari Prasad Chapagain, a civil society leader of Rupandehi and a member of the Consumer Interest Protection Forum, says private hospitals in Butwal are more interested in making money than helping those in need. “They do not follow government mandates. They act as if they have to bear the expenses of providing free service to the poor when in fact they get tax rebates and such for such services,” he said. “The sub-metropolis also does not do the needful. Everyone is corrupt including the city officials.”  \nThe duel between Kathmandu’s 34-year-old mayor Balendra Shaha (popularly called Balen), a structural engineer, reputed rapper and political novice, and 72-year-old Khagda Prasad Sharma Oli, a high school dropout, two-time prime minister, political veteran and chairperson of the Communist Party of Nepal (United Marxist Leninist) is a caricature of contemporary Nepali politics marred by the conflict between the old and the young. The duel has attracted numerous newspaper articles, set social media on fire and provided YouTubers a field day. What is Oli’s motive in mobilising his whole party to attack Balen, and what is Balen—a lone man with no political experience and political following—doing picking a fight with Oli? How will the duel impact Oli’s party and Balen’s aspirations going forward? The fightThe Balen-Oli fight began when the metropolitan city started to clear buildings built illegally on municipal land or business advertisements that did not comply with municipal regulations. The city would order the current occupants of the offending buildings or business owners to comply with the law and vacate the premises. In most cases, the occupants would ignore the order. Like in old times, they relied on their political connections to continue to subvert the law. However, that did not work with Balen. He sent municipal forces to demolish the encroachment and non-compliant adverts. The first property subjected to the mayor's action belonged to someone connected to the UML. Soon after the clearance, a Central Committee member of the UML, Mahesh Basnet, called upon his minions to physically harm Balen if he did not “mend his ways”.Balen’s attempt to clean up Kathmandu from squatters occupying public land, particularly river banks, intensified the conflict. Oli publicly mocked Balen for using bulldozers to demolish plastic shades built by “poor squatters.” Some “squatters” are believed to occupy multistory buildings constructed on public land and own businesses worth millions of rupees. The majority of them are UML voters, “UMLs’ vote bank”, observed a Balen supporter. The squatter problem is not new. All previous governments, including the one led by Oli, recognised it. The conflict became increasingly acrimonious when Balen opened the basement of Dharahara for car parking. The government objected, arguing that the reconstruction of Dharahara is still incomplete and the car park is unsafe to use. Balen retorted, “Dharahara was inaugurated as a completed project by Prime Minister Oli before the last election. How can it be incomplete?” The inauguration of the work-in-progress was one of Prime Minister Oli’s pre-election charades. The car park is safe and currently in use; the reconstruction continues. The recent New Road imbroglio added fuel to the fire. Balen started widening the footpath on New Road to comply with the standards set by the Nepal Department of Roads (NDR). A local ward chair, a UML member, objected and complained to the Ministry of Physical Infrastructure and Transport headed by Deputy Prime Minister Ragubhir Mahaseth, an Oli acolyte. The NDR, which reports to Mahaseth, issued a “stop work” order. Incensed, Balen asked Oli to expeditiously arrange repayment for those who cheated the so-called Giri Bandhu Tea Estate land plotting scandal. Oli’s apparatchiks compared Balen to “a puppy” (a good-for-nothing weakling) and chastised him for maligning “our respected Chairman”. Oli himself has described Balen as a “bubble” which will fizzle out in no time. The fightersOli is old, witty, foxy, prickly, intolerant of criticism and, like all other politicians, corrupt in the public eye. As enunciated during his premiership, his vision of economic development includes building view towers, providing Kathmandu households with piped gas within six months, and building facilities for maritime trade—the latter two unachievable pipe dreams or political ploys. Balen is young, angry, ambitious, audacious, brash, bold, impulsive, focussed and untainted by corruption. His vision for Kathmandu is to make it a clean, functioning, beautiful heritage city. In about two years since he became mayor, Kathmandu has become relatively cleaner and greener. Its roads are rid of perpetual potholes; its sidewalks are walkable; teaching standards in public schools have improved; private schools who were short-changing on paying taxes have been forced to pay their share; emergency ambulance service has become more dependable, and so on. All of the above, despite a lack of support from political parties and the government. Parties do not support him because his success will spotlight their past failures. Despite the odds, his accomplishments have made him hugely popular throughout the country. “If we have ten leaders like Balen, we can change the country,” an exuberant Kathmandu taxi driver told me. Even the international press has taken note of Balen’s leadership. The New York Times published a story on Balen last year. He was named one of the 100 upcoming leaders in 2023 by the internationally known Time Magazine, published in the US. Balen’s public support is so visceral that he gets away even with outrageous comments like “burning Singha Durbar’, Nepal’s central secretariat, the office of Nepal’s Ministries, and irrelevant dragging of Oli into the “Giri Bandhu Tea Estate” scandal, and other similar outbursts. Although the overwhelming support for such comments on social media is surprising, it is indicative of the intensity of public dislike of established politicians.The future Balen knows that he owes his popularity as much to his performance as his refusal to bow down to political pressure and to stay clean from corruption scandals. In the two years since he assumed office, he has given confidence to the city dwellers that with exemplary leadership, the city and the country can be changed. His future depends on whether he can continue to ignore political pressure and demonstrate his perseverance, will, guts and vision to turn chaotic Kathmandu into a livable metropolis. As for Oli, UML lost the last election in Kathmandu because its mayor, a UML member, was a dismal failure. The confrontation with Balen for political upmanship and ego inflation will unlikely win Kathmandu for him. Cooperation may work better than confrontation.    \nDespite the significance of public spaces in urban areas, Kathmandu Valley faces a scarcity of open public spaces, with irregular distribution and limited accessibility, leading to encroachment and compromised effectiveness due to unifunctional planning and ecological considerations.\nNepali art exhibitions held in May-June 2024 at Kathmandu’s major galleries represent the diversity of the idioms of Nepali paintings executed in traditional, ethnic and modern forms. Visiting the exhibitions, closely observing the artworks, and interacting with the curators and some artists, I realised that the quest for the right idioms to express the major motifs of paintings continues to be the main thrust of the artists. In this article, I am alluding to the genre of paintings exhibited in galleries. I have attempted to review the paintings displayed at the exhibitions and briefly discuss the diverse modalities and practices of exhibitions, as well as the impact of audience-oriented activism. Though I have been writing on the diverse genres and forms of Nepali art like sculpture, architecture and installation-oriented works mainly curated in Nepal by Sangeeta Thapa through major events under such rubrics as “biennale and triennale”, I have mostly produced reviews of paintings over the decades. I have put my review writings in catalogues and journals. In recent years, I have been writing articles on art for the academic journal Sirjana of the Sirjana College of Fine Arts. Navindra Man Rajbhandari, an artist, art teacher, curator, and pedagogue, has been working earnestly to edit and publish this journal. I visited the painting exhibitions in the major galleries—two at the Nepal Art Council, Babarmahal and one each at the Nepal Academy of Fine Arts and the Siddhartha Art Gallery. Interestingly, all these exhibitions are audience-oriented. The painting exhibition practice often follows the rituals of cataloguing the works with simple introductions and price tags written somewhat half-heartedly. They also mention the mediums used by the painters, like oil, water, gouache and, very commonly, acrylic. From the early artists who were exposed to Western art to those of contemporary times in Nepal, all use the same mediums as artists anywhere in the world. These mediums are the universal shapers of the idioms of paintings. Nepali painters use the above-mentioned mediums and other admixtures according to their modern training and indigenous painting traditions. The evolution of colour paintings, especially oil, marks the presence of the audience or the clientele of paintings; it has become a commonly recognised subject. All came through modern education in art. Artists’ emotions and the consonance of cultural and aesthetic factors are commonly represented in such paintings.One eloquent example was seen at an art exhibition, “Deities of Nepal II”, held at the Nepal Art Council in May-June 2024. This exhibition, principally curated by the art academic Swosti Rajbhandari Kayastha, presented some remarkable paintings and their projection modalities. The diversity of the paintings executed according to the overt and covert themes of sacrality had one common element. Their choice of colours and hues and their delineation to create the exquisite beauty of the mythopoetic figural of the characters in the paintings was one eloquent feature. Modern painters also treated the divine figures and their aura in their non-figural works. I especially liked the modern techniques in these paintings about the deities. The thrust was experimental. Some artists, comparatively, made very good paintings; others were just cliché works, naturally. However, the common strength and feature of all the paintings that featured the iconography was what the brief brochure text says: The composition of “the deities intricately woven into a tapestry of philosophical and spiritual beliefs.” The other was the search for an appropriate style for projecting the spiritual motifs. The paintings appeared to establish a covenant with the audience, this time through a pricing pattern. Paintings were liberally priced; some were priced up to Rs4 million. And the remarkable matter was that some of these expensive paintings were “sold” to Nepali buyers. We should remember that the paintings were sold as works of art, not as pictures of religious iconographies. The entry of the modern audience into Nepali paintings is what matters here. John Berger, a great art critic, says that the painting itself should generate the buyer’s desirability through its touchable and visual attraction. I saw this covenant at this exhibition. The next display was the “National Exhibition of Fine Arts 2024”. This one presents a different perspective in my collection several decades’ glossy catalogues of the Nepal Academy of Fine Arts. This exhibition, curated by Devendra Kumar Kafle, aka Thumkeli, its member secretary, and other departmental academy members, presents a unique view of Nepali art. Kafle guided me through the variety of artworks and described the collection methods. The collection is based on the modality of sampling artworks of Indigenous and regional features and bringing them out to the national exhibition, which is a remarkable activity. The Academy has published small glossy catalogues for them. In his note, the Chancellor of the Academy, Naradmani Hartumchali, says this is a culmination of such exhibitions in all seven states. He stresses the need to bring art to a level where indigenous forms could be made a topic of political significance by evoking such features as representation and social transformation. I don't know of any well-researched discussions on this important topic initiated by any authentic institutions. But the exhibition speaks for itself. The current exhibition, “Threads of Simultaneity”, organised by ‘Sirjana 2024’ and mainly curated by Navindra Man Rajbhandari, exhibits 200 pieces of artwork executed by 28 artists at the Arts Council. Artist Rajbhandari revealed that the exhibition was an attempt to project a historicity of a combined nature of art activity shared entirely by the academic cohort of the institution. The exhibition features some works of the erstwhile principals Sashi Shah (2001-11), Krishna Manandhar (2011-17) and Madan Chitrakar (2018-22), and members of the Sirjana College of Arts like Vatsa Gopal Vaidya and other senior artists associated with the college one way or the other. Works of the young and senior artists are on display. I also want to recall yet another unique exhibition organised by Siddhartha Art Gallery, “Sawari Kathaharu: Art in Motion”, in May 2024. The concept of motion in art is presented by creating the art of motion, as in Ralph Lily Turner’s “Storms”, Hokusai’s “Great Waves”, Pablo Picasso’s “Guernica” and Sashi Shah’s “Darting Horses”, to take a few examples. Capturing the fixed images mounted on darting objects like vehicles and exhibiting them in a reputed gallery is designed to showcase experimental works and their appeal.May and June 2024 were eventful in the realm of Nepali art. I was struck by the variety of motifs and styles that show the performative mode of Nepali paintings. \nIn yet another instance of the Nepali society failing to provide a safe space to women, a 16-year girl was raped in Panchadewal Binayak Municipality in Achham on Monday. The victim was staying in a chhau goth, or menstrual shed, at her maternal uncle’s home when she was violated by her distant relative. After years of awareness campaigns and the breaking of chhau sheds by central and local governments as well as non-governmental agencies, the victimisation of women remains a daily occurrence in several parts of Nepal, especially Karnali and Sudurpaschim provinces. The chhaupadi system was outlawed by the Supreme Court in 2005; in 2017, it was made punishable by up to three months in jail or a fine of Rs3,000 or both. But the inhumane practice remains deeply rooted in parts of Nepali society. While reports of extreme cases come from the hinterlands, menstrual taboo rules the roost even in the sophisticated drawing rooms and kitchens of urban centres. Impurity runs in the psyche of the average Nepali; menstrual blood simply oils the juggernaut of superstition, patriarchy and misogyny that is Nepali society.As disturbing as the news of the rape is the report that the victim’s relatives tried to conceal the incident. After all, this is a society whose so-called honour lies in the private parts of a woman. If it cannot save the woman from predators, it must hide the fact that it could not save the woman. From celebrating and defending rape-accused celebrities to punishing victims for speaking up, this society fails women each day. Just consider how unsafe this place is for women who have to suffer the indignity of chhau in this day and age. Cold, rain, wild animals, serpents or asphyxiation do not even come close to the danger they face from men. The tragic irony is that the woman who becomes “impure” or “untouchable” inside the home remains an object of desire inside the chhau shed. Consider how many cases of sexual assaults might have been brushed under the carpet in the name of family honour. Every night a woman has to spend in a chhau shed should count as the death of the conscience of Nepali society.Gauri Kumari Bayak and Amba Bohara and her two children were killed in 2018; Parbati Bogati and Parbati Budha were killed in 2019 in menstrual huts; and the list goes on, the tragedies returning each year. How many women must be raped and murdered before the society goes beyond the “shame” and “honour” dichotomy and considers women equal humans? How many seminars, constitutions and movements does it take for the state to be able to create a safe space for women? The society and the state must answer. Until it can guarantee safety and dignity to the women, the Nepali state might want to keep the national flag half-mast. After all, one-half of the flag belongs to the women, who make up half of the country's population.  \nThe Nepali cricket team is returning home today after a bittersweet performance at the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup 2024 in the US and the West Indies. But at the same time, it has sent an unmistakable message to the world: “We have arrived!”Nepal technically did not win any of the group stage matches at the world cup. The only point it got was through a draw with Sri Lanka after rain forced the match to be abandoned. The match with Sri Lanka was certainly the most anticipated considering how they were a relatively weaker team in the group and Nepal had a great chance of getting both the points. But Nepal was not out there looking for the weakest. Rather, it was there to take on the strongest cricketing giants. In the other three matches—against the Netherlands, South Africa and Bangladesh—Nepal gave its opponents ample evidence of its arrival on the global cricketing scene. The most electric performance, of course, was against South Africa when Nepal lost by just a run. But even in the narrow loss, it won plenty of hearts and accolades, having forced a top Test cricket-playing nation ranked third in one-day internationals and fifth in T20 internationals to run for its money. Neither could the Netherlands and Bangladesh take Nepal for granted. What was equally gratifying was the forceful presence of Nepali cricket fans cheering for Team Nepal. The Nepali fans did not only fill the stadiums from Texas to Florida to St. Vincent, they cheered on even as their team lost. This was not just due to a strengthening spirit of sportsmanship but also the confidence that we are rising and rising as a cricketing nation. At home, though, there is still a lot of work to do. The men in blue and red might want to work on their batting skills, for that is where we flattered the most this time. After assessing their World Cup odyssey, captain Rohit Paudel and coach Monty Desai will certainly sit down to work out a new plan of action, and we must have faith in their leadership—after all, Nepali cricket hasn’t been as consistently strong as it is under them. What we need immediately is investment in infrastructure. We do not even have a single stadium with floodlights, let alone proper stands and toilets for the spectators. The stadium in Kirtipur is rustic and amateurish at best; the one in Mulpani is taking ages to complete although it has been used for some tournaments; and the one in Bharatpur that has been partially built by the Dhurmus-Suntali Foundation has a long way to go before it comes into operation. Moreover, our players have limited exposure to even regional cricket although we live at the nervecentre of the cricketing world—South Asia. Nepal must take the initiative to invite regional cricketing powerhouses such as Afghanistan, Bangladesh, India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka for friendly and competitive matches so that our players get greater exposure. We have seen how Afghanistan has risen as the dark horse of cricket in just a few years with the right kind of regional support, mainly India. We stand to be the next big story in the cricketing world if we play our shots right.  \nWhile countries worldwide are forging ahead on an electric future, Nepal is still struggling to set clear plans and policies in the field. The government’s 10 percent tax hike on electric vehicles (EVs) for the fiscal year 2024-25 comes as a tight slap to the country’s commitment to EV-based mobility by 2030—at a time green transport systems across the country feel ever more important. For this or that reason, consumers here are obliged to line up for a whole day, if not days, to fill up their motor tanks. In a recent case, the underpaid fuel station workers halted fuel supply to private dealers and thronged the state-run stations in Kathmandu. These occurrences are here to stay, reminding us of the need to take the EV transition seriously. It is widely known that promoting EVs offers multiple benefits. The transition to electric vehicles in Nepal will not only reduce vehicular emissions and clean the air but also discourage the country’s overreliance on fossil fuels, which account for more than 17 percent of the total import bill. This shift, in turn, can help us leverage our under-tapped hydropower potential to build charging stations and export electricity to the two closest neighbours transitioning to green policies. EVs are costly to install, and concerns about insufficient charging stations in Nepal remain, but they are still more efficient and cost-effective than petrol or diesel vehicles. Nepal will also benefit from increased climate funds in the long run if we successfully make air breathable by cutting vehicular emissions through EV adoption. After all, Nepal must have a moral ground and track record of actions to negotiate for these funds and can’t always fall back on the excuse of the country’s negligible contribution to greenhouse gas emissions. What policymakers seem to be overlooking is the urgency of EV adoption. Their plans and policies on electric vehicles are ambiguous as, on the one hand, they pledge a green energy future while, on the other, they agree on building oil pipeline projects with India. Moreover, they always set ambitious goals and fail to achieve them. For instance, by introducing the Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC) in 2016, the government aimed to increase the share of EVs to 20 percent of all passenger vehicles; however, by 2020, only 1 percent were electric. Now, when people are more interested in buying these green wheels due to the tax cut on EVs last year, the new tax increment is bound to affect their choices. These developments are setbacks to meeting net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2045 and decarbonising the transport sector by 2030.It’s high time to come up with clear policies on green growth and execute interventions that wholeheartedly support electric vehicles. This includes installing charging stations and finding ways to sustain them by emulating international practices on repurposing, recycling and managing used batteries. Many organisations, donor agencies and development partners are extending their hand to Nepal in this effort. Failing to establish clear strategies and imposing tax restrictions could mean missing out on the benefits these agencies can provide and the overall change electric vehicles can bring to Nepal. The green energy goal is worth pursuing collectively, as no less than the future of humanity depends on it. Nepal as a responsible global actor must do its bit.  \nThe government’s recent decision to recall ambassadors, particularly Nepal’s envoy to India, just ahead of Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal’s visit to New Delhi, courted widespread controversy. What are the takeaways of the prime minister’s Delhi visit? What is the progress in implementing the trade and transit agreement signed with China and with the BRI projects? Thira Lal Bhusal of the Post sat down with Rupak Sapkota, foreign affairs advisor to the prime minister, for some insights.The government’s decision to recall ambassadors from 11 countries at once has come under heavy criticism. Why did the government take such a decision?In general, it has become a practice of sorts to recall incumbent ambassadors and appoint new ones after changes in the government or in the ruling coalition. This has both merits and demerits. The country’s foreign policy doesn’t change with a change in government. But every government and coalition has its specific policies, programmes and priorities. Therefore, even other countries make changes in political appointments as per the government’s priorities. Our case is a bit different. Ruling coalitions are frequently changed, and so are ambassadors. As there is a high chance of our politics being governed by coalitions given our electoral system, it has become necessary to establish a rational system on ambassadorial appointment. Either the political appointees themselves should voluntarily quit the job and return home just like vice-chair and members of the National Planning Commission do. Or there should be a consensus among major political forces to allow our ambassadors to serve out the full term.The second option of allowing ambassadors to serve out their term sounds better, doesn’t it?Definitely. Some initiatives have been taken with the objective of making our diplomatic appointments more prestigious, merit-based and better-managed. The government in 2019 introduced some criteria on ambassadorial appointments. We have to put more effort into ensuring that our ambassadorial appointees have the capacity to effectively carry out diplomatic duties. Once we establish a system of appointing envoys based on merit and not out of political biases, we can create a situation of allowing them to serve for the full term. Then, a change of coalition wouldn’t affect their continuity. We need to develop such a political consensus, given our geopolitical sensitivity.But the ambassadors appointed in recent years and their activities in host countries have lowered the bar of our diplomacy.We have seen rapid and huge changes in power equations in the world. In view of that, we can see some countries have appointed former ministers and even prime ministers as envoys to the countries with whom they have vital relations. They also appoint such personalities as envoys for a special mission. So, we have to think about ambassadorial appointments from different perspectives based on the changed context. It is high time that all the political forces and leaders agree on a basic point that those who have in-depth understanding and expertise of the field and can work for the best interest of the country will be appointed the country’s ambassadors. If the individual is competent, the person’s affiliation to a political party may not be a problem. But whether the person can work in the best interest of the country must be considered before appointment.But the government itself doesn’t seem serious about maintaining diplomatic decorum. For instance, the June 6 Cabinet meeting decided to recall the ambassador from India just days ahead of the prime minister’s New Delhi visit. There were also reports that the prime minister made the decision reluctantly due to pressure from coalition partners. What is the real story?It is nothing more than a coincidence. There were discussions about making changes in the ambassadorial positions in line with the March 4 changes in the ruling coalition. But it was deferred as the government needed to accomplish some important tasks and convene events such as the investment summit. When the government decided to change our ambassadors, it just happened to coincide with the prime minister’s visit to New Delhi to attend the swearing-in ceremony of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. It was a coincidence. Despite the decision, the ambassador had sufficient time to properly conclude all his engagements and duties there. The way he facilitated the process during the prime minister’s visit doesn’t reflect any misgivings about the government’s decision. So, it should be taken as a course that is in keeping with our tradition. In recent decades, other countries have given top priority to economic diplomacy, but the selection of our envoys and their activities doesn’t reflect that. Why aren’t we thinking in that direction?Yes, diplomacy in the past used to be one-dimensional, or it was conducted mainly by one particular ministry—the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. These days, many other ministries are engaged with international agencies. Economic diplomacy, labour diplomacy, climate diplomacy and security affairs have become crucial. We have to increase coordination, cooperation and collaboration among relevant agencies to make our international relations more fruitful and in line with the policies and goals set by our government.We have seen profound changes in terms of approaches, perspectives and dynamics of diplomacy in recent decades. All countries have started to give more importance to the competence of diplomats also in view of the increased geopolitical competition and rivalry seen between world powers. Rapid innovation in science and technology has not only eased our lives but also added challenges. We have to handle so many diplomatic engagements. Similarly, the number of international forums where we have to engage are increasing. These days, multilateral diplomacy and engagements have become as important. Even minilateral forums have started to play vital roles in international relations as the world powers have adopted multiple strategies to create their spheres of influence. In the meantime, the role of public diplomacy has become influential. So, a diplomat today must be dynamic and efficient enough to grasp the international situation, understand the sensitivity of the host country, articulate our country’s views efficiently and work in national interest. Therefore, it has become vital to be extra careful while selecting ambassadors.You talked about better coordination but we don’t see any correction in the practice of bypassing the foreign ministry while working with international agencies.Definitely, the foreign ministry is our focal point for all international relations conducted by a ministry or agency of our country. There should be no dispute about that. We need to make the foreign ministry more resourceful. Then, the ministry will have more capacity and efficiency to handle issues related to security, finance, labour and climate.Why have we failed to maintain reciprocity in terms of diplomats’ relations with the leaders of host countries? For example, our ambassadors in some capitals don’t get to meet the host leaders for years while the foreign envoys in Kathmandu can meet our prime minister and foreign minister directly and instantly.We have to see it from two perspectives. One is the power structure. In international relations, we can see the reflection of the asymmetric power relations between the big powers and other countries. The more developed and resourceful country’s influence in a host country can be seen and felt. Second, despite being an envoy from an underdeveloped or a small country, one can have diplomatic relations based on the principle of sovereign equality. It depends on the individual diplomat as well.In Kathmandu, we often err when dealing with foreign envoys. We have to decide what level of importance to give them. Therefore, some initiatives have been taken to correct and maintain consistency by implementing a diplomatic code of conduct that aims to integrate all activities through the foreign ministry. Foreign envoys will follow the system if we implement it consistently, irrespective of changes in the government. For that, there should be a political understanding at the national level.Let’s move to Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal’s recent India visit. Though it was mainly to attend the swearing-in ceremony of Indian Prime Minister Modi, he held some important political meetings. What are the takeaways from the visit?The visit was important from bilateral, regional and international perspectives. Traditionally, foreign affairs was described as an extended form of domestic affairs. But these days, international affairs have influence over domestic affairs as well. So such meetings and dialogues at the prime minister’s level are important. They exchanged views in a very cordial atmosphere. Of late, we have maintained bilateral dialogues at the political level on a regular basis and that has helped remove misunderstandings. Our prime minister’s emphasis is to hold bilateral dialogues both at the political as well as diplomatic levels in order to settle differences. India has taken this spirit positively.Second, the two prime ministers discussed how to expedite the implementation of the agreements reached between Nepal and India during Prime Minister Dahal’s official visit a year ago. The issue was discussed during the meeting between Prime Minister Dahal and Indian External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar as well. They also expressed satisfaction over progress in the implementation of bilateral agreements mainly in energy trade, connectivity and investment. In recent years, we have seen progress in investment, economic and trade sectors. Yet we still have some differences on border issues. That is an important and positive development in Nepal-India relations in recent years. In the past, when we had some differences on political, border or other issues, that used to badly affect other aspects of our relations. But now, both the countries agree to resolve outstanding issues through dialogue and our trade and all other affairs are moving ahead smoothly. This is the encouraging part of our relations. But border disputes can sour our relations anytime, right? Is there a sense of urgency to resolve it once and for all?The prime minister is for activating the concerned bilateral mechanisms to resolve such issues. He has also invited Indian Prime Minister Modi to visit Nepal. We can expect the Indian prime minister’s Nepal visit in near future. We can make some progress in resolving some outstanding matters such as border issues during the high level visit. I believe we will move ahead in this direction.Any progress on submitting the report of the Eminent Persons’ Group?During the meetings, the prime minister raised overall bilateral issues that include the matter related to the EPG report. I think once the mechanisms are activated and start working, that will create a situation for the report’s submission.Nepal and Bangladesh are completing homework for greater energy trade. India’s facilitation is a must for that. Is there any progress on securing the southern neighbour’s support for that?Progress in energy cooperation is a major achievement of this tenure of the prime minister. The progress is not limited to the bilateral level but goes to the regional level. A Cabinet committee of the Bangladesh government earlier this month approved a proposal to import 40 megawatts of electricity from Nepal. At present, we will use India’s infrastructure to export energy to Bangladesh. But for the long term there is a plan to build a dedicated transmission line for that. This shows it is not only Nepal that is interested in exporting its energy but other countries in this region are also interested in importing Nepal’s electricity. We have also signed an agreement to build a cross border transmission line with China. The doors are being opened for regional trade of our energy. This development will make India more open to importing energy from Nepal.Why are we failing to expedite projects under the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) of China?The economic cooperation between Nepal and China has substantially increased after we joined the BRI framework. So, Nepal has been benefitting from the BRI. We see some concern about the lack of progress on certain infrastructure projects to be built under the BRI framework. In fact, we are in a better position to implement the projects because now we can decide what kind of BRI projects are good for us based on the experience of project development and implementation under the BRI in other countries.We are working to finalise the BRI implementation agreement. Nepal wants to move ahead by signing the implementation agreement and developing the projects. Nepal joined the BRI framework based on its need to diversify trade and connect to the world market. The reality is the same now. So, we need to sign the implementation plan and move ahead as soon as possible. When I attended the Boao Forum a few months ago, I found the Chinese authorities and other stakeholders holding debates to build quality and resilient infrastructure. They also have plans to support the capacity enhancement of human resources and transfer technology in the BRI member countries.People mainly link the BRI with big infrastructure projects such as railway, road and transmission connectivity but there is no significant progress on these fronts. What are the roadblocks?In Nepal, no big infrastructure project has been completed on time, be it the Melamchi drinking project, airports, hydropower or road projects. We haven’t developed the capacity to build big projects, and we don’t envision any plan to operate after building it. So, not only with China but also with other countries and agencies, we have to seek support for small and medium-size projects that we can efficiently build and operate. Also, the third version of the BRI action plan has included building not only big but small and smart projects under the framework. We have to push for that. As we build our capacity, we can gradually take up big projects. For instance, now we can build big hydro projects on our own. It wasn’t the case until some years ago. We developed expertise in hydropower by building many small projects in the past few decades and gradually enhanced our capacity. We have already faced problems in operating the Pokhara and Bhairahawa airports. Is there any progress in taking Chinese support to operate the airports?We have to see both aspects—domestic as well as international use—of the airports. The two airports have helped us upgrade the quality of our domestic air travel as the passengers have benefited due to the upgraded infrastructure. The number of domestic passengers in these airports has increased significantly.It is true that there is no progress in terms of operating them as international airports. The government is studying all possibilities of their use based on their unique features. We are exploring various options in international markets to attract adventure tourists to Pokhara. Chinese stakeholders are also holding some promotional activities in Pokhara. Chinese authorities have told us that they are consulting with their provincial bodies and exploring possibilities to run regular flights to Pokhara. Similarly, the government is mobilising our embassies and other stakeholders in certain countries having a large number of Buddhist tourists to operate flights to Bhairahawa, and we have received some positive responses. I believe we will be able to operate regular international flights from these two airports soon.It’s been eight years since we signed the trade and transit agreement with China, which was touted as a historic deal between the two countries. Why haven’t we been able to implement it?Some symbolic steps have been taken in this period. For instance, a shipment was received from a third country [Vietnam] using a Chinese port in September last year. Similar other initiatives have been taken but these are limited to symbolic gestures. We have to prepare infrastructure and some legal basis to implement the agreements in a more result-oriented way. A bilateral meeting is being held this week. The meeting is likely to discuss how to bring the trade and transit protocol in an effective way. This meeting will discuss various issues faced so far and will also pave the way forward. We have also proposed to form a ministerial-level mechanism to oversee overall bilateral issues. The upcoming meeting will sort out various issues.The Chinese side was conducting a feasibility study of the Keirung-Kathmandu cross-border railway project. What is the progress?There is progress in various projects that we are carrying out with Chinese support. The cross-border railway feasibility study is in the final stage. Likewise, the study on the Chhahare-Tokha tunnel project is ongoing. A Chinese team is arriving to conduct a feasibility study of the Hilsa-Simkot road. A process to award a contract to build a friendly bridge at Hilsa with Chinese grants has begun. A foundation stone will be laid there soon. Also, a study to build the Chilime-Rashuwagadhi-Keirung 220kV cross-border transmission line is beginning soon. \nThe government has decided to make the National ID Card mandatory in order to receive services from government and public institutions. In the first phase, the June 6 Cabinet meeting made the National ID card number mandatory in 28 districts. People including federal lawmakers criticised the decision saying that it was enforced without first distributing the cards. In this context, Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal sat down with Yubaraj Katel, director general of the Department of National ID and Civil Registration.Let’s begin with a basic question. Why do we need a National ID card while we already have citizenship certificate, driving license, passport and voting card?There is a fundamental difference between a citizenship card and National ID. Citizenship establishes whether you are a citizen of the country and it helps you identify yourself with some basic details. In Nepal, it was also widely used as a service card. Wherever you go, you have to show the citizenship card—to open a bank account or acquire a SIM card for a phone. If we study international practices, there are mainly two cards—one is an identity card and the other is a service card. In 2018, the Nepal government came up with the idea of distributing national identity cards with a unique digital number for each eligible citizen. The number can track not only the individual but also the person’s activities and movements. This project has various components. First is data collection. It has two categories—demographic data, such as the names of father, mother and other family members. Second is biometric data—fingerprints, eye retina and digital signature. The biometric data is crucial to create a unique identity of each individual and avoid duplication in the integrated national database. The National ID has these two types of data. The other tasks are enrollment of the data, printing and distribution of the cards and then providing services based on that. At present, people carry multiple cards in their pockets. The objective of this project is to replace all of them by a single card–National ID. The new card includes vital details of all other cards in its chip with 1GB storage capacity. The government wanted to trace people based on their unique individual numbers so that there is no need to print and carry multiple cards. There is a huge industry of printing separate cards for each and every service that is creating a jumble of information. The National ID will not only replace multiple cards but also help authorities control criminal activities like financial frauds by removing duplication. At present, government authorities have difficulty in tracing and identifying an individual and wrongdoers are benefitting from that situation.What cards will be replaced by the National ID?It has a chip with 1GB storage capacity where you can store your driving license, academic documents, voting card, insurance details, ATM card number, etc. For instance, if you go to a telecom company to acquire a SIM card, they will ask for a copy of your citizenship card. You can say, ‘no, I have a National ID card’. Once you give your number and fingerprint, they can immediately verify it through the system. Another objective is to help people get rid of filling up pages of forms for each service. International governance has a norm that says don’t ask citizens their information more than once. A state agency should seek the information once and provide it to other state agencies if they require it. People complain that many agencies don’t accept National ID. They still ask for a citizenship card for official record and verification. So, in practice, it didn’t help people reduce the number of cards in their pockets. In fact, it added one more.Therefore, the June 6 Cabinet decision made the use of National ID cards compulsory in 28 districts. Now, it is going to be essential to get social security allowances, pensions and claim health insurance. The Health Insurance Board has said it has become challenging for them to verify whether a claimant is the rightful one. The board has 8 million policyholders. We will give them our details. Then, they can cross-check the authenticity of a claimant. This will help avoid huge financial frauds. In fact, the government should have made it mandatory earlier.But people including lawmakers in the federal parliament have strongly opposed the decision saying that the government made National ID mandatory without first distributing the cards to the people.Nepal’s total population is over 30 million. Our principal stakeholders are citizenship card holders. Those 16-year-olds are eligible for citizenship cards. The Election Commission distributes voting cards to those above 18 years. We got the data from the commission and added 20 percent and estimated that we have 18.6 people above 16 years old. As of Friday, we have already distributed the National ID numbers to 14.9 million people. Now, as per our estimate, around 3.7 million people are yet to get the National ID. Millions of people are abroad. Thus, we are headed towards saturation point in terms of data collection and issuance of the numbers. One thing I want to stress is that people don’t need a hard copy of the National ID card. The number is sufficient. Printing cards is costly. We have to pay around 2 euro to procure a blank card. The cost of printing, delivery and other overhead expenses is added to that. With the task of printing over a billion copies of ID cards being too costly, even India discourages use of hard copy of the cards. You can create the QR code of your card, save it in your mobile or print it in a paper and scan it wherever you need it.Officials at our government agencies bring up the rule that makes it mandatory to present a physical copy of citizenship card or other documents for official works.Yes, we are trained and habituated in that way. Now we need to change. We must make offices paperless while developing a strong database system. We have been using citizenship cards to verify the identity of a person for a long time. Biometrics not only helps identify people but also trace their activities. Recently, Rs2 billion was found in the bank accounts of a 26-year-old man. The money was deposited in 56 bank accounts. He used 13 ATM cards and 17 phone numbers. Once the National ID card is implemented, transactions and movements of such wrongdoers will be easily traced and monitored. Identifying individuals accurately is crucial to ensure good governance and strengthen security. Many people have acquired fake citizenship cards. People even made fake passports. Implementation of National ID will control it. It is also related to our national image. It will help improve the status of our passport and add authenticity to our other documents as well.Once the National ID comes into wide use, our details will be traced and used by multiple agencies. State agencies and other institutions benefit from the integrated database as they can easily trace us. But how do you ensure our data isn’t misused and it doesn’t make us insecure?If you have a National ID card, you don’t need a hard copy of your driving licence. There is a backlog of around 2.1 million licences. The government has failed to print and distribute them. We told them, we have already procured 12 million cards. Of them, 3.2 million cards have already been printed and we still need to print around 8 million cards. Once the licence data is integrated with the National ID card, it will be shown there. Now, to come to your question, only the traffic authority can access the licence-related data. The device they use will trace only relevant data. Only an authorised agency will get access to the data and it can’t be used for anything other than the stated purpose. We give access to agencies like Nepal Rastra Bank, Nepal Telecommunication Authority and Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal. Then they regulate the things in their domain. No unauthorised body or individual can access it. Do the implementing agencies have infrastructure to use this technology?We are in a position to implement it in some parts of the country. Therefore, we are implementing it in phases. We are making it mandatory for certain services in 28 districts from mid-July. We should have started much earlier. It must be expedited.Lawmakers said in a Parliament meeting that the decision has ‘terrorised people’ in the 28 districts as locals feared they might be deprived of the services as the government has made National ID cards mandatory without first distributing them.We started the National ID registration process from 2018. Registration teams reached in each local ward except in Mugu and Humla districts of Karnali. It was carried out as a campaign. Even after the drive’s completion, the registration process was open in all the 77 districts, 54 area administration offices and in palika (local unit) centres. We also had registration centres in major downtowns. We receive data of around 4,000 registrations a day. So, there has been sufficient initiative and enough time to encourage people to get the number. Besides, if anyone in the 28 districts are still to get the ID number, they still have three months to register.You said only an ID number but no hard copy was needed to access any kind of service, right?Exactly. There is no provision that states one should produce a hard copy to get any service. You give the number and your biometrics to verify that you are the right person. Then, the official can crosscheck it in the database within seconds.Do all the implementing agencies have the devices that read the National ID cards?We have distributed 4,200 machines that read the cards in 333 local units of the 28 districts. Likewise, we have asked other local units and districts and some agencies such as banks to procure the devices and we have given the specifications based on their requirements. A device costs just around Rs 1,500. You can enter the number and place your thumbprint on it. We have trained relevant officials from all the local units for the purpose.How many cards can the department print at present?We can produce 1,500 cards an hour. But now we are producing only 1,800 a day. We have the strength to distribute 30,000 cards a day but are distributing only 5,000 a day.Again the same question. Then why are people not getting the cards?There is some communication gap. People who registered in 2018 or 2019 haven’t contacted us. We are giving them priority to clear the backlogs. But people who are newly-registered are showing more interest. So, we need to strike the right balance.When will the department be in a position to distribute the cards to all the people?At present, we can print 100,000 cards a month. We have a space to double the capacity. Meanwhile, people have now shown more interest. By enhancing our facilities’ capacity, we can print the pending 8 million cards in the next 40 months.What about election cards? Do we need to register for that and get the voting cards?In fact, the Election Commission doesn’t need to collect data and issue cards. We will talk to them. As a constitutional body, we have to readily make the data available for them. In fact, the National ID Card system can help the commission make voting arrangements for the Nepalis abroad because it can accurately identify the right person and can immediately update the integrated system here in Nepal about the votes cast in any country. This card will be helpful in conducting fair elections because the biometric data stored in this system will be perfect bases to identify the people and instantly update the activities in the database.You have emphasised replacement of other cards by the National ID cards. How long may it take to do so?We plan on giving priority to three sectors—banking, civil aviation and telecom. People right now need to fill separate forms for these services that have irked the service seekers. We have asked the bankers to buy the devices. We as a supplier are ready. Now the stakeholders should be ready too. It will benefit them because it helps control frauds.What if I don’t register for the National ID card?In the first place, you will be deprived of social security funds, pension, insurance policies. Likewise, the government will gradually make the card compulsory to receive many other services such as driving licence, land transaction, telephone numbers, bank accounts. How do you assure that our data stored in this system isn’t misused?See, the current practices make you more vulnerable. Because multiple agencies take your data for various purposes. Do they have a system to protect the data and ensure that it isn’t misused? But when your data is stored only by a dedicated government agency, it will be more secure as the agency is specialised for that. When other authorised agencies seek data, we give them access only to the relevant one. We have a National Identity Management Information System (NIMIS). We have maintained three layers of security—L1, L2, L3—to ensure foolproof security of the data. There are three servers.Are we dependent on any foreign company for any related service?So far, only one international vendor is involved but we are cutting down its involvement as well, with a plan to ultimately replace it by our own agency. The vendor now helps transfer collected data to the printing machine through the Automated Biometric Identification System (ABIS). But our plan is to do so through our own government agency or local vendor. We do all the other tasks. Security printing is done within the office basement where every movement of people is monitored and recorded. \nPrithvi Subba Gurung, deputy general secretary of the CPN-UML, is one of the leaders who strongly lobbied for a federal system while the Constituent Assembly was writing the constitution between 2008 to 2015. Eight years after the adoption of the federal democratic republican constitution, the federal system, particularly the provinces, are widely being criticised for their supposed failure to deliver. The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal asks former Gandaki chief minister Gurung what went wrong in the course of implementing the federal system.The implementation of the federal system has faced several hurdles since its adoption. Most provinces have for months failed even to form the governments, let alone run them efficiently. Where is the problem?We have adopted a federal system but are working against its spirit. Provinces should run autonomously. On some key issues, federal leaders and the party’s central bodies may give some direction to their provincial bodies. But most provincial activities are still centrally-governed even years after the adoption of federalism. So, our practices aren’t in line with the system. The provincial governments shouldn’t have been affected by the changes in the federal coalition. Such problems were seen in India years ago. But they have learned from their experience. In our case, leaders of major political parties treated the provincial governments as party chapters. The provincial governments are formed and run as per the constitution and all the three tiers of the governments are autonomous. The high commands in our political parties aren’t ready to accept the new constitutional setup.Are the provincial leaders equally responsible as they seek Kathmandu’s nod before taking any important decisions?They seek the centre’s support because they are trained in that way. They are too dependent on the centre. You said India learned by experience and now provinces there work more autonomously. But, in Nepal, provinces are now witnessing more problems than during their first tenure, which is evident also in the difficulties in government formation in multiple provinces. Why couldn’t they learn from the five-year experience?Nepal’s leaders and political parties are still not committed to federalism. They have failed to implement the federal system as per the spirit of the constitution. This is the major problem. The big parties as well as their leaders are guided by a centralised mindset and still prefer working in a unitary system. We should not forget that we transformed the executive and legislative bodies into three tiers of federal systems. But our judiciary retained the old structure. Therefore, the judiciary doesn’t accept the federal system and its practice in a true sense. Its verdicts reflect the same.The role of Speakers and Province Heads has courted controversies in multiple provinces. The top court invalidated some of their decisions. Is it because of lack of clarity, faults in our constitutional provisions, or is it because of the leaders?Speaker and Province Head are political posts created in accordance with constitutional provisions. When overall politics is dirty and unhealthy, those taking up these responsibilities also feel compelled to resort to similar tactics. When overall politics improves, they automatically make better decisions. Mainly there is no leader in the high command who completely owns federalism and is determined to implement it in its true spirit. This government in its policies and programmes unveiled last month had rightly said that “protecting federalism and strengthening the federal democratic republic is our top priority”. But the budget failed to introduce programmes as per the promises made in the policies and programmes.How do we correct these anomalies? Where do we begin?We are in a complex situation. Many have started to float the idea of making amendments to the constitution. But we shouldn’t forget that various forces and stakeholders had their own positions during constitution-making. They made compromises and found middle grounds to promulgate the constitution. If we go for amendments, they all will return to their respective stances. Some may want to revive the Hindu Kingdom while others will stand against it. Some leaders even within Nepali Congress have started to advocate for constitutional monarchy. But we can’t regress to the monarchical system. We can’t renounce secularism and an inclusive democratic system. We can’t backtrack on our commitment to a socialism-oriented system. We may explore some changes in our electoral system or form of governance without going against these key features of our constitution but we can’t destabilise the charter. What are the major flaws to be fixed?There are some. For instance, provinces have no role in education. The responsibility of education up to secondary level is given to the local level. And, everything is controlled by the federal government. The local units are entrusted with key responsibilities such as developing curriculum, overseeing the issues of career developments of teachers and staffers and their promotion as well as transfers etcetera. Local units can’t do all of these things efficiently as they have their own limitations. How can a local unit transfer a teacher from Kaski to Lamjung? Provinces should have been given such responsibilities. The power has been centralised at Singha Durbar. Such is also the situation in other sectors.Though the proportional representation (PR) system is hailed as one of the most beautiful features of our constitution in terms of ensuring inclusion, it has also been blamed for political instability. Many have demanded revision in the electoral system.The major political parties such as the CPN-UML and Nepali Congress have not trained their party members on the proper implementation of key constitutional features such as federalism and electoral system. The party members and general people have either wrongly understood it, or have negative impressions about the systems. These systems were adopted with an objective to resolve our decade-long conflict and address the concerns of the historically marginalised communities and even mainstream some groups through an inclusive democratic system. The idea was to integrate all the communities and maintain unity in diversity. After holding years-long debates on various options, we agreed on the mixed electoral system so as to reflect our diversity in the state agencies.As the proverb goes, “the bad workman blames his tools”, our leaders are blaming the system for their failure to secure a majority by winning people’s trust. Many countries that practise similar electoral systems have progressed. Our electoral system and the form of governance are not causing political instability. Many countries have adopted a parliamentary system and many others have practised the presidential model. Countries have progressed in both the systems. Also, there are examples of failures under both setups. So, the problem lies in our political parties and leaders, not in the systems. Shouldn’t political parties like the UML and Congress work with a plan to secure a majority by winning people’s trust? They aren’t training their focus on that but blaming the system. At times, they have squandered the majority as well and have failed to keep the party intact. Isn’t it our [leaders’] failure?Some argue that the issue of the fractured mandate can be addressed by increasing the threshold ceiling for political parties to be eligible to get PR votes and that can be done by amending election laws. Does it help?This is the idea coming from big political parties because they get more votes when fringe parties disqualify for PR votes. But a higher ceiling may deprive many small parties from representing certain communities. So, this goes against the spirit of inclusion. What we need is a good coalition culture. If we see the trend of recent decades, Indian politicians have become much more mature in this context. In the past, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi accommodated his electoral alliance partners in his ruling coalition even though his party won the majority single-handedly. If we scrap the inclusive electoral system, won’t the marginalised communities again revolt? We should be careful about that.At times, leaders have helped dissident groups split their party. These are the same leaders who issued an ordinance to change the provision that required a group within a political party to show support of 40 percent members of the party’s central committee “and” the parliamentary party. Only then could it split. They changed the threshold to 20 percent, and the “and” provision had been changed to “or”. The provision of requiring 40 percent support on both sides had earlier been included to ensure political stability. But the leaders who are helping party divisions are blaming the system for instability in the country. So, we [leaders] have to mend our ways, not blame the system. The Rastriya Swantantra Party, the fourth-largest in the lower house, has officially said that it wants to overhaul the federal system and drastically downsize the provinces. Also, leaders within the major parties who earlier stood in favour of federalism have started criticising it. On Saturday, Congress General Secretary Gagan Thapa said the country can’t sustain the provinces in their present form. What is your view?I am one of those who advocated for a federal system even before the first Constituent Assembly because Nepal is a country full of discrimination based on caste, class, region and religion. We advocated for the system to do away with these discriminations and find a system to maintain unity within diversity. Federalism is the best system to promote national unity as all groups get their own space as per their unique features. For instance, if you make multiple rooms in a building, you can give space and adjust more people. But if you keep many people inside a big room, they will have difficulties—no matter how big the room is. We should strengthen the federal system. We can’t regress.Then, why do many people see provinces as a burden?In Nepal, the federal system was projected as a structure that resulted in huge liability to the state coffers. But the facts don’t substantiate it. A local unit in the federal structure replaced many erstwhile Village Development Committees (VDCs). For instance, in my home district of Lamjung, eight palikas covered the areas of 61 VDCs, and the expenditure of the current eight local units is no more than that of the erstwhile 61 VDCs. Now we don’t need 77 district coordination committees. They can be scrapped. No province needs more than seven ministers. Likewise, the federal Cabinet can be drastically downsized. Why do we need a 25-strong Cabinet at the centre when we already have seven other provincial cabinets? Twelve ministries are enough at the centre, as suggested by the high level commission on administration reform.There are many departments and divisions that were designed under the unitary system that have become completely redundant in the federal setup. So many project offices established over two decades ago based on the needs of that time are still there. These irrelevant bodies should be scrapped. This is how we can significantly cut down on administrative costs. Leaders and people don’t discuss that. They only blame provinces. \nLawmaker Jiban Pariyar, a joint general secretary of the Nepali Congress, the main opposition, was a member of the four-member taskforce that prepared the terms of reference (ToR) of the parliamentary committee to probe the cooperative scam. The taskforce finalised it after a prolonged dispute over whether to categorically mention Deputy Prime Minister and Home Minister Rabi Lamichhane’s name while defining the committee’s jurisdiction. The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal talked to him about the ToR finalisation process and other aspects of the probe. It took weeks to finalise the ToR and jurisdiction of the parliamentary committee formed to probe the cooperative scam. How did you finally reach an agreement? I will give a brief context first. Cases of cooperative frauds had been made public even in the past. But this time, some groups and gangs were seen to be working in an organised way to embezzle billions of rupees deposited by common people. Some established people, including those active in politics, were found to be misusing the people’s hard-earned money. This issue was thus urgent and our party Nepali Congress raised it strongly in Parliament. We had raised this issue even when we were in the government [before March 4]. We had raised it with erstwhile home minister Narayankaji Shrestha in parliamentary committees and other platforms. We had talked to him about the involvement of lawmakers and other politicians in such scams.But the Congress raised this issue more strongly after the party quit the government.This is true, and for a good reason. We demanded a parliamentary committee to probe this issue after our party’s exit from the government because Rabi Lamichhane, someone linked with some big cooperative scams, became home minister. We raised this issue after he was allowed to lead the same ministry and police agencies that were supposed to be investigating the scams. Earlier, various agencies within Nepal Police and other government bodies were looking into the matter. Erstwhile home minister Shrestha had assured us of an independent and fair investigation. Lamichhane transferred police officials who were investigating the scams, and tried to protect cooperative operators involved in wrongdoing. Based on all these activities, we concluded that a parliamentary probe committee is a must and we firmly stood for the same. Initially, we raised this issue in Parliament without obstructing House proceedings but the government compelled us to disrupt the meetings after it refused to address our concerns. The prime minister tried to give Lamichhane a clean chit by saying that he was not involved in the cooperative scams. Also, the Nepal Police chief at a parliamentary committee meeting said that the home minister wasn’t under investigation as he had done nothing wrong. In the meantime, the attorney general issued a letter stating that no cooperative-related case was registered against Lamichhane. It became clear that the government agencies wouldn’t investigate the issue independently. Then, we raised the issue strongly and we even had to obstruct Parliament meetings. After the pressure, top leaders from the ruling as well as opposition parties agreed to form a parliamentary committee to investigate the matter. The leaders formed a task force led by Law, Justice and Parliamentary Affairs Minister Padam Giri and entrusted us with preparing the committee’s ToR and defining its jurisdiction.But at the task force meetings, members from the ruling parties lobbied to define the committee’s jurisdiction in a way that only allowed for investigation into the wrongdoings of cooperatives and their operators but not those involved in syphoning money from there through illegal means. They argued that only those who issued the loans should be made liable, not those who obtained it. Their intent was to protect Rabi Lamichhane. But I insisted that our duty is to find where the common people’s money has been spent or misused and then to return the money to the depositors. I insisted on investigating Lamichhane as various studies have shown his involvement in the misuse of depositors’ money.Then, we started exchanging written proposals. We exchanged and discussed many such proposals in writing. We insisted on mentioning the names of Lamichhane and the Gorkha Media Network—where Lamichhane and GB Rai invested tens of millions of cooperatives’ money—and ensuring that the depositors get their money back. After a long negotiation, members from the UML became a bit flexible. But the Rastriya Swatantra Party of Lamichhane continued to be rigid. Then, we finally agreed to mention the names of the cooperatives from where Lamichhane and his former colleagues had obtained money and to name Gorkha Media Network but not Lamichhane.But won’t keeping out the name of the sitting home minister create more confusion and disputes?There is no need to be confused. The ToR has stated the name of Gorkha Media Network, where Lamichhane and his team invested the money they got from the cooperatives, and the ToR’s Annex-2 has a list of cooperatives from where they obtained the money. It has also stated that “responsible officials of the company” involved in such transactions would also be investigated. Even other firms and individuals linked to the transactions will be probed. So there is no chance of keeping Lamichhane away from investigation. The committee’s jurisdiction defined in the ToR is clear on this.Will your party ask for Lamichhane’s resignation after the committee starts investigating him?Our party is yet to formally demand the home minister’s resignation. But questions have been raised about him in Parliament, in various public platforms and in the media. Also, the general public has raised this issue. He knows the committee will summon him for interrogation. A few months ago, when a minister [from Congress] was summoned by the Commission for Investigation of Abuse of Authority, Lamichhane was the one who strongly demanded the minister’s resignation in Parliament. He will soon face the parliamentary inquiry committee. Let’s see how he faces it. Leaders from ruling parties including the prime minister have accused the Congress of personally targeting Lamichhane after he refused to join a Congress-led coalition in which he was offered the prime ministerial position.Leaders from new parties should understand that political leaders engage in dialogue with all political forces. Some meetings are convened in a strategic way. This is natural in a democracy. Also, Lamichhane met with our party president. But they spread a rumour that our party president offered him the prime ministerial position. That’s not true. The argument that we targeted him after he refused to join our coalition is baseless. The Congress has officially decided that the probe committee can investigate any of our members suspected of wrongdoings. Has any other party made such a decision officially? We have also officially challenged the home minister to prove the allegations he labelled at our party leaders from Parliament’s rostrum. We have also challenged him to investigate and prove the charges.When the names of head and members of the parliamentary probe committee became public, many thought that the parties didn’t give due importance to the panel as they nominated relatively low-profile lawmakers. Why didn’t the parties choose powerful leaders to investigate a national crisis of this magnitude?This is a wrong perception. All members are federal parliamentarians. They shouldn’t be judged based on their personalities and profiles. The committee is powerful because it has a mandate from the House, and its jurisdiction and the ToR give it power. What we should carefully follow is their work. They can invite experts and specialists—such as chartered accountants, bankers, account specialists—if they require technical expertise during the investigation.Lamichhane himself is chair of the fourth-largest party, which has a decisive role in the ruling coalition. Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal and CPN-UML chair KP Sharma Oli had initially ruled out any need of investigation into the home minister. In this context, can the committee members freely conduct the investigation?I am confident that even the committee member from the RSP can’t defend his leader when the documents and facts show that the money was illegally released. How can other members protect him? I believe they will conduct the investigation independently and come up with a consensus report. Documents, facts and figures guide investigation. This isn’t like leaders giving statements on public platforms. We are not saying he must be proven guilty as the Congress has blamed him. He may prove to be innocent after investigation. We should accept if the evidence proves Lamichhane innocent. The bottom line is that the investigation should be fair. Many Congress leaders are also involved in cooperative scams and other corruption cases. So people suspect that leaders will eventually trade off and the probe panel will be only an eyewash.This investigation cannot be weakened under any pretext. I am saying this based on the documents and evidence I have studied. Also, the media and other stakeholders such as the study report of Pokhara Metropolitan City and the investigation report of Rupandehi District Police, among others, have already made ample evidence public. It’s not easy to acquit the guilty.What will Congress’ approach be if the committee, where ruling parties have a majority, fails to decide by consensus and members take decisions on a majority basis?In the seven-member panel, there are two members from our party and one from the Rastriya Prajatantra Party. If those from the ruling parties pushed for a wrong decision based on their majority, members from opposition parties will counter that and register their differing views. If such a situation arises they will be free to make the reality public and they can even bring out a different report.Was Congress under pressure to reach an agreement as there were reports that the government was preparing to unveil the budget through ordinance citing opposition’s House obstruction?We weren’t worried about that. In fact, the prime minister’s initiatives and his seriousness to end the House deadlock played a crucial role in helping us reach this agreement. \nAmnesty International’s Secretary General Agnès Callamard was in Nepal last week as a part of her first South Asian tour. During her four-day visit, she interacted with people from all walks of life, including the prime minister, in an attempt to gauge the human rights situation here. In this interview with Binod Ghimire of the Post, Callamard talked about the human rights situation in Nepal and the rest of the world. Excerpts: You have been travelling this part of the world, interacting with people. How do you evaluate the human rights situation here?Human rights are backsliding everywhere. It’s a global phenomenon. There is backsliding on civil and political rights, freedom of expression, press freedom and freedom of peaceful assembly. There is backsliding on women’s rights and non-discrimination on economic rights, and in terms of armed conflicts. The number of people dying in armed conflicts is increasing exponentially. We are in deep trouble as far as human rights protection is concerned. The South Asia region hasn’t been immune to the global trend.For my mission, I am visiting Sri Lanka and Nepal. In the two countries, we observe the shrinking of civic space and greater weaponisation of laws to curtail freedom of expression, particularly online. The digital laws are often overbroad and disproportionate. Banning TikTok in Nepal, for instance, is a disproportionate overbroad measure of the violation of international laws. We are observing a great deal of attacks in protests. The use of lethal force or disproportionate use of force by the police in response to even peaceful protests is increasing. There are incidents where protestors have died after the use of police force. There are issues of impunity for past crimes. A study by a European research centre shows that fewer people live in democracies worldwide in 2024 than in 1986. This is a complete U-turn. What do you see as the reasons for the backsliding? There are several factors that explain the backsliding. One could be growing restlessness and anxiety due to economic downturns. There was a severe financial crisis in 2008, and we didn't really recover from it. The inequalities within states and between states have increased in the last decade. We have seen a sharp increase in the wealth of the super-rich. On the other hand, the poor are getting poorer. This is feeding anger and creating fertile ground for populism. The authoritarian leaders are feeding on that particular ground. The backsliding is also linked to Covid that had a terrible impact on the economy and society. During Covid, the governments adopted different emergency measures but, in many cases, those measures were never lifted. In Europe, refugees, migrants and minorities are viewed as the reasons why the economy is not picking up and they are accused of stealing jobs. In every country, the minorities have been made the scapegoats. There is a resentment that democracy has not delivered for the people. The expectations are high, but the governments have failed to act accordingly. Therefore, the people are prepared to listen to the authoritarian leaders. By authoritarian leaders, I do not mean those who are in power by force but those who are democratically elected. They are elected by the people, but they practise authoritarianism once they get into power. In Nepal, the burning problem of authoritarianism has been reflected even in local politics. For instance, the mayor of Kathmandu has resorted to repeated attacks against street vendors and landless people. These are authoritarian moves. Such leaders target vulnerable groups who cannot protect themselves. You are in Nepal at a time the government has arrested the owner of the largest media house. How does Amnesty International look at this situation?We are very alarmed and upset. We call on the government to release him immediately. Even if the charges are valid, they certainly do not justify imprisoning him. Amnesty International believes that the use of those charges is politically motivated and is an attempt to stifle dissent. It is a response to the professional investigation and reporting about the policies and practices of those in power. This is an attempt to silence him, to silence the news media and to silence journalists. By so doing, the authorities are also violating the rights of the Nepali society to access information at a time when they need that kind of information. The attack on Sirohiya is an act of reprisal, censorship and violation of his own rights and the right of the Nepali people to freedom of information and freedom of press, which is also a collective form of rights.We believe that he might have been arrested in relation to the reporting of financial fraud by people in power. Many people with whom I have interacted say that that safe space of expression is shrinking in Nepal. There are incidents where people have been arrested for criticising people in authority.Unregulated generative artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a big threat. How can it be regulated?Globally, information technology and AI present many opportunities for people. But they also present risks. Amnesty International has focused on the risks. We have identified discrimination and biases. Data upon which some of these AI tools are based are inherently biased. They are based on a sample of a certain group of people, which can not be the ground for effective policy making. We are campaigning against the use of AI for facial recognition for mass surveillance. It is a violation of the freedom of movement and freedom of privacy, and many communities around the world are disproportionately affected.We have done several studies that show that mass surveillance and facial recognition are used in the most impoverished African-American communities in the United States, Muslim communities in India and Palestinian communities in Israel and occupied territories. Cyber surveillance and spyware are other problems which have been widely used to target journalists and human rights defenders, as well as opponents. We have been demanding that spyware be regulated. So far, this has been excluded from different regulations related to information technology.Generative AI has huge implications for the world, societies and human beings. Currently, only the European Union has made attempts to regulate it by adopting an AI Act last December. This is imperfect but is a first step. We have criticised it because it excludes cyber surveillance and the use of AI for security purposes, and it doesn’t stop the use of AI targeted at refugees and migrants. Nevertheless, other aspects of the law are positive. Do you think other countries should follow the European Union’s footsteps?Yes, they can build on it without going below the benchmark. We encourage all countries to prepare and enact better laws. We are calling on governments to take it as an example, but after correcting the shortcomings.Why do you think Nepal’s transitional justice process has been stuck? What can human rights organisations like Amnesty do to push it forward?Sadly, the transitional justice process hasn’t progressed in several countries. I think the leaders are so keen to preserve the peace that they are prepared to give up on justice. They fear that if they open the gate to judicial reparation and investigation, what has been achieved so far will be dismantled. That’s the fear that I have seen everywhere. Everywhere, including in Nepal, the leaders create opposition between peace and justice.You can see many governments are opposing the International Criminal Court prosecutors’ arrest warrant in relation to Gaza, saying it will create problems in agreeing on a ceasefire. This is nonsense.Peace and justice are two sides of the same coin. In fact, peace is not sustainable without justice. When justice is not delivered, the conflict is bound to recur. It is just a matter of time. We often hear the excuse that if a particular leader or a person is prosecuted, that would affect peace. On the contrary, not investigating the perpetrator is a real challenge to peace. Many people who are in power after a peace deal themselves are guilty of war crimes. They don’t want to be held accountable. It is not in their interest to deliver transitional justice. It takes an incredible, highly moral and principled leadership to take the process ahead.We have seen here that the transitional justice process has been paralysed. Successive governments have failed to act on the Comprehensive Peace Accord. They haven’t acted on what the Supreme Court told them in 2015. It had directed them to review, revise and reform the Transitional Justice Act.Here I have seen the categorisation of crimes as serious and non-serious, which is very strange. It is shocking to me that some killings are considered non-serious, and could lead to de facto amnesty for those responsible for them, even though these crimes fall under international law. If someone was killed after torture then two crimes have been committed—torture and killing. Right to life is the most important right. The investigation should be done accordingly. The same is the case with sexual violence with rape and without rape.What is alarming is that people are losing trust. If people do not trust the systems that are supposed to deliver justice, that will cause a big problem. The Truth and Reconciliation Commission and the Commission of Investigation on Enforced Disappeared Persons couldn’t undertake proper investigation and prosecution. Not all have received the government’s relief, which has led to much frustration and animosity. There is political interference on transitional justice, which also lacks independence and transparency.We are calling on the authorities to act as directed by the Supreme Court, ratify the statute on the International Criminal Court as well as the International Convention on Disappearance. Do you see chances of international interference if Nepal continues to delay justice delivery?There is no doubt that some crimes committed during the war fall within universal jurisdiction. If the perpetrators of those crimes travel to countries where a framework of universal jurisdiction has been enacted, they could be arrested there. We are seeing the multiplication of universal jurisdiction cases in Europe.Cases of custodial deaths, torture and extrajudicial killings are common in Nepal. How can they be checked?Different organisations like Amnesty International should be monitoring the abuse of power by the police and state authorities. There must be impartial and fair investigation of such incidents. But there is a regime of impunity. The police are not very keen to investigate themselves. I wanted to mention the case of Ajit Mijar, which is an example of justice being denied. It also shows the complicity of the institution in denying justice.Nepal is ranked the fourth most vulnerable country due to climate change though it contributes negligibly in greenhouse gas emissions. The largest polluters haven't fulfilled their responsibilities towards Nepal. How can organisations like Amnesty advocate for countries like Nepal?Amnesty International has long been advocating for climate justice. We have a set of demands. We are advocating at the United Nations level and also at the COP. We are pushing through COP our message of loss and damage, about the responsibilities of industrialised countries to cut their reliance on fossil fuel industries and so on. The impact of global warming will lead to loss of lives in places like Nepal and Pacific Islands.We saw very timid steps taken in COP in UAE last year. These steps are far from sufficient. We see countries multiplying their investments in fossil fuel while big fossil fuel companies are also violating their written commitment to decrease the reliance on fossil fuels. This is alarming.However, we have made some progress on loss and damage. Governments are recognising the principle of loss and damage for the countries that are least responsible for climate change. They can rely on some kind of global financial system to protect and support them in case of a sudden climate related crisis. We are now advocating for the responsible countries to set aside the necessary funds.Nepal is at the receiving end of climate change though the country is not responsible for it. However, the Nepali government also has a responsibility towards its people. The extreme weather risk faced by Nepal demands urgent acts from the authorities. The most vulnerable communities are at particular risk. The government must have instruments to protect them.  \nToday, the weather will be partly to generally cloudy throughout the country.Koshi, Bagmati and Gandaki will likely experience heavy rainfall in the hilly regions.
