Write it in the form of inspiring story not news article or event.\n    \n    Story:\nOnce upon a time, nestled between the towering peaks of the Himalayas and the lush jungles of the Terai, there was a country named Nepal. Though still a developing nation, Nepal was a land of profound beauty and deep-rooted cultural heritage. The residents of Nepal faced many challenges, but beneath these hardships lay a resilient spirit and an unyielding hope for the future.\n\nThis enchanting land, where Mount Everest reaches towards the skies and the air carries a mix of incense and cool mountain breezes, was more than a geographical marvel. It was a mosaic of cultures, languages, and traditions, a testament to human endeavor against all odds. Nepal's history, from the unification under King Prithvi Narayan Shah to its transformation into a federal democratic republic, told a story of aspiration and endurance.\n\nIn recent years, the people of Nepal, with their indomitable will, had taken strides towards rebuilding and reimagining their country. They turned their struggles into stepping stones, each challenge a chapter in their ongoing saga. The shift from a monarchy to a republic had not only changed governance but had woven a new tapestry of democratic values and collective decision-making.\n\nEconomically, while agriculture continued to sustain a large part of its population, Nepal had begun to harness the potential of its picturesque landscapes, developing sustainable tourism that promised to preserve their natural heritage while boosting local economies. Communities living in the shadows of the Himalayas had become stewards of the earth, protecting the biodiversity that made their country unique.\n\nEach day brought new stories. Whether it was a festival in Kathmandu, a technological advance in Pokhara, or a conservation effort in Chitwan, these events were threads in the vibrant quilt of Nepali life. These stories, updated daily, reflected the pulse of progress and the spirit of hope that characterized this resilient nation.\n\nAnd so, as Nepal moved forward, each moment was not just a passage of time but a promise of potential, a narrative of a nation perennially climbing towards tomorrow, guided by the legacy of its past and the dreams of its future.\n\nNews events:\nNepal and China held diplomatic consultations, discussing bilateral relations, the Belt and Road Initiative implementation plan, economic corridors, transit protocols, airport operations, and foreign minister-level mechanism upgrades.\nCooperative victims resumed their protest in Kathmandu demanding the government's implementation of agreements reached with ministers and criticizing the parliamentary special committee's impartiality in investigating the cooperative scam.\nOver 1,000 A(H1N1) infections, along with other influenza strains, have been detected in Nepal, prompting concerns over undiagnosed cases and the potential for a respiratory virus pandemic due to low vaccination rates and inadequate surveillance.\nNepal urges Pakistan and Bangladesh to reduce tariffs on large cardamom exports, as India dominates the trade but re-exports to those countries with higher prices.\nThe House of Representatives endorsed the 1.86 trillion rupee budget for fiscal 2024-25, rejecting proposals to reduce expenditures for various ministries.\nThe Supreme Court on Tuesday convicted five people, including former minister for economic affairs of Madhesh Province Bijaya Kumar Yadav, in a corruption case.The bench of Special Court chairperson Tek Narayan Kunwar and members Tej Narayan Singh Rai and Muraribabu Shrestha convicted them of corruption in the snake breeding programme of the Jhala Nath Khanal Academy of Health Sciences.Academy chair Rewati Prasad Pant, general secretary Nawaraj Bhandari, treasurer Niraj Bhandari and member Devendra Raya were also pronounced guilty. The next hearing will determine the punishment for them.The then mayor of Lalbandi Municipality Man Bahadur Khadka and the then economic affairs secretary of the Madhesh government Prem Kumar Shrestha have been acquitted.On October 8 last year, the Commission for the Investigation of Abuse of Authority filed a Rs170.9 million corruption case against seven individuals, including the then minister. They were accused of embezzling government funds by diverting them from their original purpose. \nThe Supreme Court on Tuesday dismissed a writ petition filed by former chief minister and Nepali Congress lawmaker Kedar Karki challenging the government formation in Koshi Province.A full bench of Justices Kumar Regmi, Nahakul Subedi and Aziz Musalman quashed the writ petition filed against Chief Minister Hikmat Karki.Following the apex court’s decision, Hikmat Karki will continue as the chief minister.The former chief minister moved the apex court, claiming Hikmat Karki’s appointment was unconstitutional. He has asked the court to issue mandamus, certiorari, and quo warranto orders to reinstate him as the chief minister.On May 9, Province Head Parshuram Khapung appointed Hikmat Karki as per Article 168 (5) of the constitution after the UML leader staked his claim to the post with the support of 52 lawmakers. The support of 47 lawmakers is required for a majority to form the government in the 93-strong assembly. It is Hikmat Karki’s third stint as a chief minister and the sixth government in Koshi in 17 months after the 2022 November elections. He was elected to the provincial assembly from Jhapa Constituency-5 (1). \nClimate change has caused deadly snakes and dengue-carrying mosquitoes to expand their habitats into Nepal's mountainous areas, while wild animals have also migrated to higher elevations.\nNepal's alternative political scene, while popular, lacks focus on Dalit issues, perpetuating apathy and exclusion towards the Dalit community, necessitating the creation of a Dalit-led, non-partisan organization to address and rectify this neglect.\nPolarisation has surged globally, benefiting right-wing agendas due to failed promises and ineffective solutions from centrist/left-leaning parties in addressing societal issues like abortion rights, migration, economic inequality, foreign policy, and climate crisis.\nA parliamentary committee investigating cooperative scandals faces jurisdictional challenges, potentially protecting a deputy prime minister accused of money laundering.\nNepal and China commit to enhance bilateral cooperation in various areas, including trade, investment, infrastructure, and tourism, while celebrating the 70th anniversary of diplomatic relations in 2025.\nKenyan police fatally shot at least five protesters and injured dozens as they tried to storm parliament to protest tax increases, with clashes and demonstrations also occurring in other cities.\nDeputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Narayan Kaji Shrestha has reiterated Nepal’s commitment to regional cooperation and multilateralism and stressed the need to implement the Asia Cooperation Dialogue Vision 2030 and the ACD Blueprint 2021-2030.The foreign minister made the remarks in his address to the 19th ministerial meeting of the Asia Cooperation Dialogue held in Tehran, Iran, on Monday, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a press statement.Shrestha said ACD has evolved as an Asia-wide regional forum for open and consultative dialogues on pressing issues impacting the region and beyond.According to the foreign ministry, he highlighted challenges posed by Covid-19, climate change, global economic recession, rising conflicts, and geopolitical rivalry. Shrestha also underlines the importance of collective vision, unity, solidarity, and mutual collaboration for a more integrated, resilient, and prosperous Asia.The ministerial meeting adopted the documents, namely, the Guiding Principles for the Functioning of the Asia Cooperation Dialogue Secretariat and the ACD Rules of Procedures, which provide a framework for cooperation among ACD members and an important basis for institutional strengthening of the ACD Secretariat.On the sidelines of the meeting, Shrestha held bilateral meetings with Ali Bagheri, acting foreign minister of Iran; U Than Swe, deputy prime minister and minister of foreign affairs of Myanmar; Abdullatif bin Rashid Alzayani, minister of foreign affairs of Bahrain; Abdullah Ali Al-Yahya, minister of foreign affairs of Kuwait; Walid bin Abdul Karim Al Khraiji, vice minister for foreign affairs of Saudi Arabia; Andrei Rudenko, deputy minister of foreign affairs of Russia and discussed on various matters of mutual interests including pressing regional and global issues.As a member of the Asia Cooperation Dialogue since 2016, Nepal has been engaging with other Asian member states with a view to promoting various areas of mutual benefits and complementarities, the foreign ministry said. \nThe National Examinations Board is preparing to publish the results of this year's Secondary Education Examinations (SEE) by Friday.Mahashram Sharma, the NEB chair, said they are working to publish the results as soon as possible. “The results will be out by Friday,” he said.The Office of the Controller of Examinations under the board said the process of entering marks after cross-checking and converting them into grades is in its final stage. The office said a board meeting will publicise the results once the process is completed.The SEE results can viewed on www. results.ekantipur.com once published.A total of 504,414 students attended the examinations held from March 28 to April 9. Among them, 250,772 were girls, 253,627 were boys, and 15 were gender minorities.This year, the exams were conducted based on the new syllabus, and the results will be published using the new grading system.Under the new system, each SEE student must score at least 35 percent mark in the theoretical exams to qualify for higher studies. Students failing to secure it in theoretical exams will not be eligible to enrol in class 11 and will receive their results in the non-graded category. Previously, students received grades if they scored at least 35 marks combined from theoretical and practical exams. From now on, there will be separate grading for theoretical and practical exams. The new curriculum has introduced a system where each subject, including mathematics, will have a 25-mark practical exam and a 75-mark theoretical exam. The practical exams are conducted by the schools themselves, and the obtained marks are sent to the board. \nAn Indian court on Tuesday extended a hold on a lower court’s order granting bail to Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal in a graft case, leaving the key opposition leader in pre-trial detention.India’s federal financial crime-fighting agency arrested Kejriwal, a fierce critic of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, in March on corruption allegations relating to the capital’s liquor policy - accusations he has denied and said are politically motivated.Kejriwal was granted bail by a city court on Thursday but investigators challenged the order in the Delhi High Court, which suspended the bail order as it considered the challenge. \nAfghanistan reached the semi-finals of the Twenty20 World Cup with a dramatic eight-run victory over Bangladesh under the Duckworth Lewis System in St Vincent on Monday, joining India as the qualifiers from Group 1 and sending Australia home.Bangladesh also had a chance to progress or send Australia through with a victory but the Afghans dismissed them for 105 to take the win they needed to set up a first World Cup semi-final against South Africa in Trinidad on Wednesday.Afghanistan hopes were dented when they were restricted to a modest 115-5 but skipper Rashid Khan took 4-23 and Naveen-ul-Haq 4-26 in a defiant bowling effort that delivered victory.The last few overs were high drama played out well past midnight local time with Bangladesh needing roughly a run a ball and the DLS calculations in case of more rain changing with every wicket and boundary.Naveen delivered the coup de grace in the penultimate over by bowling Taskin Ahmed and trapping Mustafizur Rahman in front off consecutive balls, triggering tearful celebrations from his team mates.India, who beat Australia by 24 runs earlier in St Lucia to leave the qualification hopes of the 2021 champions hanging by a thread, will take on title holders England in the second semi-final in Guyana on Thursday.Rashid won the toss and elected to bat first, sending out the same team that stunned Australia at the same Arnos Vale Ground on Saturday to give themselves a shot at the semis.Openers Rahmanullah Gurbaz and Ibrahim Zadran scored a third century partnership of the tournament to build the foundation for that upset and Bangladesh were desperate to separate them quickly.The Bangladesh bowlers made scoring mighty hard as they combined for 66 dot balls over the innings but they were unable to break the partnership until the 11th over when it was worth 59 runs.Rishad Hossain (3-26) did the damage by having Ibrahim caught on the offside for 18 and the leg spinner returned to remove Gurbaz for 43 as Afghanistan collapsed from 84-1 to 93-5 in 11 balls.Afghan skipper Rashid rallied with three sixes in his 10-ball 19 and was so desperate to score that he hurled his bat down the wicket at his batting partner Karim Janat in fury when refused a second run in the final over.After a brief rain delay, Bangladesh set off at a fair lick as they chased the win in 12.1 overs that they needed to get their run rate up.Left-arm seamer Fazalhaq Farooqi dismissed Tanzid Hasan lbw in the second over and Naveen removed Najmul Hossain Shanto and Shakib Al Hasan in successive balls before another shower swept in with the score at 31-3.Litton Das and Soumya Sarkar bumped the score up to 46-3 by the end of the powerplay but Rashid brought himself on and bowled the latter for 10 from his fourth delivery.Rashid came back on to dismiss Towhid Hridoy (14), captain Najmul Hossain Shanto and Hossain, the latter two in successive balls to reduce Bangladesh to 80-7 just before another shower forced the players off again.Bangladesh’s target was reduced to 114 in 19 overs after the break but their hopes of reaching the semi-finals were now gone, though opener Litton Das stood firm even as his batting partners departed in the late drama to score 54 not out. \nWikiLeaks founder Julian Assange is due to plead guilty this week to violating US espionage law, in a deal that will end his imprisonment in Britain and allow him to return home to Australia, ending a 14-year legal odyssey.Assange, 52, has agreed to plead guilty to a single criminal count of conspiring to obtain and disclose classified US national defence documents, according to filings in the US District Court for the Northern Mariana Islands.He is due to be sentenced to 62 months of time already served at a hearing on the island of Saipan at 9am local time on Wednesday (2300 GMT Tuesday).Assange left Belmarsh prison in the UK on Monday before being bailed by the UK High Court and boarding a flight that afternoon, Wikileaks said in a statement posted on social media platform X.“This is the result of a global campaign that spanned grass-roots organisers, press freedom campaigners, legislators and leaders from across the political spectrum, all the way to the United Nations,” the statement said.A video posted on X by Wikileaks showed Assange dressed in a blue shirt and jeans signing a document before boarding a private jet with the markings of charter firm VistaJet.He will return to Australia after the hearing, the Wikileaks statement added, referring to the hearing in Saipan.“Julian is free!!!!” his wife, Stella Assange, said in a post on X.“Words cannot express our immense gratitude to YOU - yes YOU, who have all mobilised for years and years to make this come true.”The only VistaJet plane that departed Stansted on Monday afternoon was headed to Bangkok, FlightRadar24 data shows. A spokesperson for Assange in Australia declined to comment on his flight plans. VistaJet did not immediately respond to a request for comment.The Australian government, led by Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, has been pressing for Assange’s release but declined to comment on the legal proceedings as they were ongoing.“Prime Minister Albanese has been clear - Mr Assange’s case has dragged on for too long and there is nothing to be gained by his continued incarceration,” a government spokesperson said.A lawyer for Assange did not immediately respond to a request for comment.HISTORIC CHARGESWikiLeaks in 2010 released hundreds of thousands of classified US military documents on Washington’s wars in Afghanistan and Iraq - the largest security breaches of their kind in US military history - along with swaths of diplomatic cables.Assange was indicted during former President Donald Trump’s administration over WikiLeaks’ mass release of secret US documents, which were leaked by Chelsea Manning, a former US military intelligence analyst who was also prosecuted under the Espionage Act.The trove of more than 700,000 documents included diplomatic cables and battlefield accounts such as a 2007 video of a US Apache helicopter firing at suspected insurgents in Iraq, killing a dozen people including two Reuters news staff. That video was released in 2010.The charges against Assange sparked outrage among his many global supporters who have long argued that Assange as the publisher of Wikileaks should not face charges typically used against federal government employees who steal or leak information.Many press freedom advocates have argued that criminally charging Assange represents a threat to free speech.“A plea deal would avert the worst-case scenario for press freedom, but this deal contemplates that Assange will have served five years in prison for activities that journalists engage in every day,” said Jameel Jaffer, executive director of free speech organisation Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University.“It will cast a long shadow over the most important kinds of journalism, not just in this country but around the world.”LONG ODYSSEYAssange was first arrested in Britain in 2010 on a European arrest warrant after Swedish authorities said they wanted to question him over sex-crime allegations that were later dropped. He fled to Ecuador’s embassy, where he remained for seven years, to avoid extradition to Sweden.He was dragged out of the embassy in 2019 and jailed for skipping bail. He has been in London's Belmarsh top security jail ever since, from where he has for almost five years been fighting extradition to the United States.Those five years of confinement are similar to the sentence imposed on Reality Winner, an Air Force veteran and former intelligence contractor, who was sentenced to 63 months after she removed classified materials and mailed them to a news outlet.While in Belmarsh Assange married his partner Stella with whom he had two children while he was holed up in the Ecuadorean embassy. \nFonepay on Tuesday said it processed UPI payments totalling over Rs250 million in volume and exceeding 100,000 transactions across Nepal since the launching of the cross-border payment system in February.This surge aligns perfectly with the peak season for Indian travellers visiting Nepal, which is expected to reach record numbers this year, Fonepay said in a statement.UPI payments eliminate the need to exchange currency or carry cash, allowing for a seamless travel experience. The convenience, security, and immediacy of UPI payments through the Fonepay network have been pivotal in driving the increase in transactions from Indian tourists, making their visits to Nepal more convenient and enjoyable, Fonepay said in a statement.“This seamless payment solution is a key factor in the rising popularity of Nepal as a preferred destination for Indian travellers,” reads the statement.Fonepay said it has established itself as the frontrunner in facilitating UPI payments in Nepal with a strong network. “The rapid adoption of UPI payments in Nepal is evidence to the growing demand for convenient and secure digital payments,” said Diwas Kumar, CEO at Fonepay. “We are thrilled to play a key role in this digital transformation and empower both Nepali citizens and Indian visitors with seamless payment options.\"Fonepay said it is fully prepared, both technically and operationally, to enable Nepalese citizens to make UPI payments in India. \nThe advocates for justice for victims of conflict-related sexual violence (CRSV) have objected to the decision by local governments to start registration of such victims, questioning its legality and assurance of confidentiality.Following directives from the Ministry of Home Affairs, a number of local governments have started collecting applications from the victims of conflict-related sexual violence.The applications have been called from women and girls who faced sexual violence at the hands of state security forces and then Maoist rebels, but whose cases are missing from the state’s records of victims. Since the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) is the authorised body to collect the complaints, advocates for the victims doubt the legitimacy of the applications solicited by the local governments. “What will be the legality of the applications? Will they be recognised by the TRC? As far as I know, the TRC will not accept them,” said Devi Khadka, coordinator of the National Association of Conflict Rape Victims, a network of CRSV victims.The government issued a circular to the local governments to collect the applications with the primary objective of providing relief and compensation to the insurgency-era victims of rape and sexual assault. The state continues to neglect such victims. Neither have they been recognised by the state nor have they received any relief from the government. As many as 63,718 complaints have been registered with the TRC. However, only 314, less than half a percent of the total, are related to rape and sexual violence. Very few victims lodged complaints as they were not convinced that their records would be kept confidential, according to Khadka. “We are not convinced that the local governments can maintain confidentiality. Unlike other victims, they cannot come out on the open because of the social stigma associated,” she said. “Most victims of rape and sexual violence haven’t revealed their ordeals even to their husbands and close family members. Doing so means breaking their families.”If Khadka’s claim is anything to go by, seven insurgency-era victims of rape and sexual violence from a local unit in the Sudurpaschim Province are in trouble as it could not keep their secrets. The representatives at the local level, however, say they are working to support the victims as per the federal government’s circular. “Some 35 victims have applied at our municipality. We are serious about maintaining their confidentiality,” Tilakram Lamsal, mayor at Thakurbaba Municipality in Bardiya, told the Post. He, however, said he was unaware whether the TRC or the federal government will recognise the applications they have collected.Officials at the home ministry also say they are not sure about the legality of the complaints. Radha Kumari Shrestha, an officer with the Peace Promotion Department at the Ministry of Home Affairs, said they got the circular to register the victims for their documentation and to provide relief and reparations. “I am not sure whether the TRC will own up the applications,” she told the Post, adding that respective local governments are responsible for maintaining confidentiality.Through the national budget the federal government has announced plans to create a peace fund of Rs1 billion to provide compensation and financial support to conflict victims. Similarly, different local governments also have allocated budgets to support conflict victims including the CRSV. After months-long discussions, cross-party lawmakers have agreed to allow three months for the registration of the complaints by the victims who missed out on doing so in the past. The victims say the government and parties should prioritise endorsing the amendment bill to the Enforced Disappearances Enquiry, Truth and Reconciliation Commission Act, which will formally open the doors for the TRC to receive the complaints.Laxmi Pokharel, a human rights lawyer with the International Court of Jurists, said the idea of allowing the local governments to keep records of victims is not wrong. However, there are no proper mechanisms at the local units to safely keep the records of the victims of rape and sexual violence. “There is no uniformity among the local governments in providing relief. While some are working actively, several others are doing nothing. This is leading to disparity,” she told the Post. “The federal government should formulate a uniform policy in providing relief, one that will be applicable across the country.”Currently, the Khadka-led organisation has been continuously working to screen the physical and mental health of CRSV victims. A recent medical test conducted among 38 rape victims from the Maoist insurgency showed 11 of them had cancer. Similarly, an additional eight need immediate surgery to remove their uterus. “Further tests are being conducted to ascertain the stage of their cancer. This is very serious,” said Khadka. In the medical tests conducted in December last year, an overwhelming 70 percent of the 127 victims had one or more reproductive health-related complications. The health condition of five of them was bad enough to need regular tests and treatment.  \nThe Nepal-India relationship is complex, wide-ranging and deep, making it difficult to fathom. That is why, despite a long apprenticeship in bilateral relations, I consider myself a novice on the subject. Sometimes, our limited knowledge creates misunderstanding and distrust even if the relationship remains intact. For the past 60 years or so, some people have tried to define the Nepal-India relationship in their own emotional ways but have failed to make any dent without India’s wish. Their concern is understandable when seen from the perspective of broad principles of sovereign equality, territorial integrity and peaceful coexistence, forgetting that inter-state relations are guided more by pragmatism than principles. For any country, national interest is supreme while conducting foreign policies. Most politicians and intellectuals driven by emotions forget that the conditions surrounding them are more deterministic than their feelings. Here comes the question of geo-politics, geo-economics and geo-strategic contexts.The Nepal-India relationship since the Treaty of Sugauli continues to define both limitations of powers and the relationship pattern. Even if some minor adjustments or changes occur, the substance and nature of bilateral relations remain the same. For some Nepalis, symbols matter more than substance, which is vital for conducting bilateral ties. Even then, both countries do not deviate from the main course of the unchanged relationship. India, too, has not departed from conventional policy by trying to operate within the same parameters as the old rulers. Even if the situation and context changed, the basics of the relationship remain the same.India does not like to disturb the structure of the relationship, relating it to its larger national security issue. It seems that even in the future, apart from some minor adjustments, it is unlikely to be drastically altered. Indians think opening the 1950 Treaty is like opening the “pandora’s box” and, hence, needs to be cautiously handled. Without being on the firm ground of reality, Nepalis will experience more woes. Knowing the implications and given the limited strategic autonomy, King Mahendra, apparently a die-hard nationalist, also didn’t raise the issue of the 1950 treaty. Still, policy measures adopted by the royal government and India have led to the erosion of some treaty provisions. Coming close on the heels of the continuity of the relationship, the former foreign secretary and Indian ambassador to Nepal, Shyam Saran, said at a talk programme recently, “There will be more continuity than departure in India’s foreign policy in coming days–in rhetoric and style”. Then what alternative approach can Nepal take? I think focusing on the country’s development, projection of good governance and image by showing the ability to prosper and make people confident should be the strategy. If all-round development takes place by raising people's life standards, national confidence and maturity would grow, eventually leading to better cooperation with the immediate neighbours. The status of a nation is not raised by too much politicisation of relationships, as we have been witnessing for over six decades. Nor is foreign policy conducted through an emotional approach alone. Some developmental activities and formal and informal channels used by both sides to sort out immediate problems arising from time to time can measure how the two countries have stabilised bilateral relations and cooperative endeavours since the 1950s. Regime changes have not at all affected the continuity of the developmental process. Today, the development pace is faster than before. The political environment, irrespective of governments, is favourable, as parties and leaders seem to have understood the significance of development despite their subjective views on various issues. Now, Nepal and India have reached an understanding of purchasing 10000 megawatts of electricity by India and facilitating Nepal’s use of the Indian corridor for power sale to Bangladesh. Since Nepal and India are two separate nations politically and historically, civilisational commonalities do not always work when the question of nation-state arises. Therefore, it is natural that some divergent approaches to events and developments are noticed not to the extent of damaging the structure and dynamics of bilateral relationships. Some issues are perceived differently by the elites of the two countries. For example, some patches of the border often trigger controversy. The two governments have claimed that 97 percent of the border problem will be solved if both sides officially agree. But Nepal is not prepared to agree unless other disputed territories such as Sushta, Kalapanri-Lipulekh and Limpiadhura are settled. Sushta’s problem could have been settled long ago as it is not serious from an Indian security point of view. The Kalapani issue is complex because India considers it settled, but it contrasts with Nepal’s claim that goes far beyond the existing border. Since the newly adopted map called chuche naksa (pointed map) that shows the border up to Limpiadhura has already been passed by the Nepali Parliament by a two-thirds majority after reaching some sort of national consensus, it has become more complex. India reacted to Nepal’s action as a unilateral “cartographic assertion”, adding that the lands claimed by Nepal belong to India. The issue has become more complicated because of the long Indian rule (bhogchalan) and Nepal’s new claim as its territory. In addition to such complex issues, minor problems such as waterlogging in some parts of the Tarai, inundation, floods and trade deficit reduction are nagging. However, the issue of balance of trade entirely lies with Nepal’s capacity to enhance production and make Nepali products market-worthy in India and elsewhere. Only then can Nepal expect India’s cooperation to facilitate Nepali products to enter the Indian market. Mutual trust and confidence on both sides are essential to resolve ensuing differences, big or small. Moreover, perception, rather than reality, gives grounds for distrust. India should not be too suspicious of Nepal’s relations with China and other Western powers, especially the US, as it is armed with leverage over Nepal because, even if it wishes, the latter cannot cross the Rubicon due to various compulsions.   \nThe day I met Rima (name changed), it was already late morning and she was anxious. There were around seven women in a small room. She rocked nervously and reiterated that she did not want to talk. We told her she did not have to. An hour later, we could not stop her from telling her story.Rima’s body was like a battleground in itself. It was 2001: Peace talks between the government and the then rebels had just failed. Nepal Army officials came to Rima’s house and arrested her. She was kept in captivity and repeatedly raped for 14 months by army personnel. She was only 14 at the time. She told her story in minute detail: How her limbs swelled up after being tied up, how the sounds of boots made her heart thump and how the men stomped on her breasts with those boots. She was stoic in her storytelling. Everyone almost forgot to breathe. But what upsets Rima now is not only her past. Like many other women in the world who were sexually abused in conflict, Rima faced social ostracism once the war ended, and twisted versions of social morality and patriarchy won once again. Rima tried to live with dignity. Rima’s quiet storytelling broke into loud sobs when she started talking about her children. Her inability to give them a decent life broke her resolve. Her strength in times of great vulnerability is what breaks my heart. This meeting was in 2021, when we were still in the uncertain stages of shooting our film, Devi. I was with Devi Khadka, our protagonist, a survivor of sexual violence in Nepal’s decade-long conflict. At the time, Devi was still quite unsure about what she could do with other victims like herself, but she wanted to investigate. We had followed her journey and found ourselves in a room of forgotten women: Girls and women who had been sexually abused and raped during Nepal’s conflict. But their existence, while cursorily accepted by the state, had been effectively erased from Nepal’s history.Devi Khadka’s story had haunted me for years. I’d read about her in the newspapers, shocked at some of the commentary, unable to grasp the callousness of it. Khadka was arrested, tortured and raped in custody by Nepal Police personnel in 1997. She was made to tell her story to the press by the Maoist Party after she was released in 1998. A well-known ‘feminist’ columnist wrote a piece in the Nepali Patra weekly in defence of the police, questioning the veracity of the then seventeen-year-old traumatised girl.It took years for Devi to trust the press, and I am humbled that she trusted me to tell her story. It took four more years of telling me her story, listening back to versions of her own story, and analysing it that helped her sharpen her vision. The very act of telling one's story can give the storyteller agency. When Devi first talked to me, she was a district leader of the Maoist party, haunted by the loss of her brother, Rit Bahadur, during the conflict. Like an automaton, she fulfilled the role of a Maoist cadre, telling herself that the party was as loyal to her as she was to the party. But as she met more victims, the change in her was palpable. For those who have not seen this change, it’s easy to dismiss Devi Khadka on so many grounds: Devi can barely understand English, the language of the world of development. She has had only one day of formal education, after all. But she can, in her mother tongue, give an eloquent expression of how wartime sexual violence survivors in Nepal can be addressed. She is doing her undergraduate studies, totally self-taught, and she pours through legal documents and policy papers, catching details that escape many. She can stand on stage, tell her story and move people to action. And she can be sharp. When someone asked her if she can handle budgets as a non-English speaker, she calmly replied, “I’ve managed ministries. Of course I can handle it. If you are asking if I can handle your language, I can always get hired help.” Yet, some from Nepal’s transitional justice community have been unforgiving of Devi, calling her “political” and disingenuous. However, this is hardly a time for pettiness.My job as a filmmaker has allowed me to examine Devi. I’ve seen the trauma that wartime rape has left her with and the struggle she still undergoes to overcome the demons left behind by it. But it is the story of many Rimas, raped by the state forces or violated by the Maoists, and forsaken by both, that has shaken Devi to the core. Once committed, she’s been steadfast. With very little support, she has built a network of survivors, lobbied with the government and other development actors, worked with human rights activists, and has added to the work of many others who have fought for justice to make a tangible impact on Nepal’s transitional justice process. The amended Transitional Justice bill, currently in Parliament, has, for the first time, included wartime sexual violence survivors and opened ways for them to get reparations and justice. Perhaps a better way to understand Devi today is as a human rights activist with political acumen. Storytelling is an act of resistance. It was for Devi but for me as well—a way of expressing solidarity to all the women who have suffered sexual violence during the war (and in peacetime). For every year that Nepal’s transitional justice process remains incomplete, women like Rima will keep suffering while perpetrators remain free. The wounds of the likes of Rima have not healed. For now, Nepal’s wartime rape survivors have some hope with this bill. Devi Khadka, with other survivors, will push on. With the other players in the field who are schooled in the language and the world of development, welcoming Devi as an equal player—not a victim any more, but a leader—will strengthen the cause.Shrestha is a filmmaker and a journalist. Her film ‘Devi’ is screening at the DocEdge Festival in New Zealand in June. \nWith a bit of luck Nepal’s fairytale victory would have been secured.The country’s hopes of progressing to the Super Eight stage of the 2024 ICC Men’s T20 World Cup ended after they lost to cricketing powerhouse South Africa by one run in a nail-biting last-ball thriller in their Group D match at the Arnos Vale Ground in Kingstown, St Vincent on Saturday.But their spirited performance earned praise worldwide after almost pulling off an upset win over one of the tournament favourites.Fielding first after winning the toss, the Rhinos restricted a strong Proteas team to a subpar 115-7 with their stupendous spin attack as Dipendra Singh Airee and part-time bowler Kushal Bhurtel shared all seven wickets that fell between them on a turning track.But they fell agonisingly short from recording their historic first ever victory over an ICC’s full-member nation after they could only manage 114-7.Despite the heartbreak, Nepal’s performance caught attention worldwide.“A performance to be proud of. Keep your heads high,” world cricket governing body International Cricket Council wrote on X, formerly Twitter.South Africa legend Dale Steyn called the Nepal vs South Africa game the “Match of the Tournament” on ICC’s Digital Daily show.“It would’ve been the talk of the tournament if Nepal would’ve gotten over the line. It would’ve been fantastic, and they deserved to win,” Steyn said. “[This was] the match of the tournament to be honest with you. I saw people crying in the stands, it shows how much it means to them, and that’s what cricket is all about.”Indian cricket commentator and journalist Harsha Bhogle said Nepal have a brighter future ahead of them.“Hold your heads high Nepal. That was South Africa you almost took down today. You have some of the most passionate fans and you let them believe. Hopefully bigger days are round the corner.”Indian Premier League franchise cricket team Chennai Super Kings wrote on X: “Unreal fans support! Unreal game of unreal night! Nepal, you have won all our hearts!”“Nepal's performance—all cricketing commentators, most of the IPL franchise teams, cricketing bodies are talking about the team, talking about that fan following!” a Nepal supporter based in Australia wrote on X. “Isn't it great? Didn't we win something?”ICC and Asian Cricket Council commentator Mikkhail Vaswani wrote on his Facebook page: “Nepal are the youngest team in this World Cup. They have put on some great performances. Time to back the boys for a very strong and committed effort.”At an average age of 23.7, Nepal are the youngest team at the World Cup. The team is led by Rohit Paudel, who, at 21, is the youngest captain in the 20-team tournament, while Gulsan Jha, 18, is the youngest player.After the match, Paudel stressed that Nepal needed more exposure against the best teams of the world if they are to be on the right side of the result.“We were very close but a little far,” Paudel said after the close contest. “In crunch moments, we did well, the way we fought was very good.”He added, “If we get more exposure regularly, then next games we will be on the other side [of the result].”Nepal were a far less experienced side as they were making their only second appearance at the world stage.Chasing, the batters took Nepal to 85-2 in the 14th over in the chase, riding on 32 runs from their power play without losing a wicket and a half-century stand between opener Aasif Sheikh and Anil Sah that came off just 36 deliveries.But the introduction of spinner Tabraiz Shamsi (4-19) would prove to be lethal in Nepal’s chase.Shamsi first dismissed Bhurtel for 13 with his only second delivery in the eighth over and Paudel for a duck two balls later to hurl South Africa back in the game.Sheikh and Sah rebuilt the Nepal innings.Sah hit three boundaries off Anrich Nortje and a six off Shamshi to raise the tempo before Sheikh smashed Kagiso Rabada for a four and a six that took Nepal past 80 total after 13 overs with still eight wickets in hand.After Sah fell to Aiden Markram (1-8) making 27 runs off 24 balls, Sheikh and Airee dragged Nepal to 98-3 from 17 overs.But Shamshi returned with the ball in the 18th over and mercilessly raided the stumps of Airee and dangerman Sheikh to turn the game back into South Africa’s favour. Sheikh finished his innings with 42 runs off 49 balls.Nepal needed 16 runs off the last 12 balls but Nortje (1-27) and Ottneil Baartman held their nerves in the final two overs to save the Proteas from the jaws of defeat.Nortje bowled four dots in the penultimate over including a wicket of Kushal Malla that left Nepal requiring 16 runs off the last eight balls.Sompal Kami hit Nortje with a long six and collected two runs off the last ball of the 19th over that brought the equation down to eight off the final six deliveries. Gulsan Jha next cracked a four off Baartman in the 19.3 overs and managed another two off the next delivery to inch Nepal closer to overhauling the target.Nepal only needed two runs off the last two deliveries to keep alive their hopes of reaching the Super Eight but Baartman threw two dots with perfect bouncers to break Nepali hearts.Gulsan Jha tried to take the game to Super Over with a desperate attempt to add a run off a bye of the final delivery but Quinton de Kock and Heinrich Klaasen combined to run him out at the non-striker’s end.Earlier, Bhurtel took 4-19 and Airee bowled 3-21 to trouble South Africa throughout the innings.South Africa added 22 runs for the first wicket before Airee got the breakthrough wicket when he caught and bowled de Kock for 10 in the fourth over.Bhurtel then bowled captain Markram for 15 in the 12th over, ending their 46-run stand for the second wicket.South Africa seemed headed for a good total when they were at 68-2 in the 12th over but Bhurtel’s wrist spin and Airee’s off break kept their powerful opponents under control.Bhurtel removed Klaasen for three before Airee got the big fish Hendricks, who top scored for South Africa with 43 runs off 49 balls, and removed David Miller for seven the next.South Africa needed sixth number batter Tristan Stubbs’s 27 not out off 18 balls for a boost to their innings.Bhurtel then underlined Nepal’s impressive bowling, claiming the wickets of Marco Jansen (1) and Rabada (0) in successive deliveries off the final two balls.Sandeep Lamichhane also started for the first time after missing Nepal’s matches in the United States due to visa issues and bowled splendidly conceding only 18 runs in his four-over spell.“I am very proud of the unit, especially the way we bowled and batted, I'm very proud of that,” Paudel said.South Africa skipper Markram was also full of praise for Nepal’s bowling.“First and foremost, the way [Nepal] bowled it made it really tough for us. They put us under a lot of pressure,” Markram said.The defeat leaves Nepal fourth in the five-team group D with one point, which they earned after rain washed out their second group match against Sri Lanka. Nepal had lost their opening game to the Netherlands by six wickets.South Africa, who had already progressed to the Super Eight round, finished the group stage unbeaten, collecting eight points from four matches.Nepal next face Bangladesh on Monday and will look to end their T20 World Cup campaign on a high note.Bangladesh are second with four points from three matches and a victory over Nepal would secure them a spot in the next round.The Netherlands, on two points, are also in contention and next face Sri Lanka who are also without a win and lie at the bottom of the group. \nThe process of enacting a separate air carriers’ liability and insurance legislation for domestic carriers has stalled yet again.On March 1, the Cabinet approved the tourism ministry’s proposal to prepare a draft bill on domestic air carriers’ liability and insurance.This was done years after Nepal adopted the Montreal Convention of 1999, which makes international airlines liable in case of death or injury to passengers. Nepal adopted the Montreal Convention of 1999 on December 15, 2018.The tourism ministry officials say that the process stalled this time after Buddhi Sagar Lamichhane, the chairman of the panel appointed to prepare the draft bill, was automatically suspended on April 5. This happened after the Commission for Investigation of Abuse of Authority filed a case against 32 individuals, including Lamichhane, at the Special Court over their alleged involvement in corruption in the April 2017 Airbus A330s deal.Mukesh Dangol, an official at the tourism ministry, said the ministry has appointed Indu Ghimire, its joint-secretary, to head the panel. “With this latest development, the process will now move ahead.”He said that after a round of consultation with the stakeholders, the draft will be sent to the finance and law ministries seeking their consent. “Following their nod, the draft will be tabled at the Cabinet before it is registered in Parliament.” The draft, however, is already ready. Officials expect the registration process to be completed in at least two months.The draft of the air carriers’ liability and insurance bill from domestic carriers, which proposes a five-fold increase in compensation for death or injury, has been in the making since Nepal ratified the Montreal Convention.The draft bill was extensively discussed with the stakeholders before it was finalised in 2020.However, successive tourism ministers failed to table the bill in Parliament. The draft bill was then kept on hold without much explanation.The long-delayed air carriers’ liability and insurance draft bill proposes a fivefold increase in compensation for death or injury.As per the planned law, domestic airlines have to pay a minimum compensation of $100,000 for the injury or death of a passenger. Currently, the minimum compensation for passenger death on a domestic flight is $20,000.Under the Montreal Convention of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), carriers have to pay 128,821 Special Drawing Rights (SDRs) or ($171,018) if the damage is due to the carrier’s negligence or a wrongful act or omission.SDRs are an interest-bearing international reserve asset used by the International Monetary Fund.Under the Montreal Convention 1999, in any crash, the victims’ families have the right to claim unlimited compensation if there is a wrongful death.The draft bill says that the carrier should make an advance payment when it is necessary to meet the immediate economic needs of passengers or the families of victims.According to the proposed law, a compensation claim should be filed with the airline or its agents within 60 days of the incident or accident. The carrier’s liability limitation for cargo lost, damaged or delayed shall be $20 per kg if the damage was caused or contributed to by the negligence of the carriers, it says.Under the Montreal Convention 1999, effective as of December 28, 2019, a carrier’s liability limitation for cargo lost, damaged or delayed shall be 22 SDRs per kg ($29.21 per kg) in the case of destruction, loss, damage or delay concerning cargo carriage.Similarly, carriers must pay 1,288 SDRs ($1,709.90) for each passenger in case of baggage destruction, loss, damage, or delay.Likewise, 5,346 SDRs ($7,097.16) should be compensated for each passenger in relation to damage caused by delay in the carriage of persons.The domestic carriers, however, have been objecting to a few clauses, such as the carrier’s liability for delays and unlimited compensation, which, according to them, is not practical in a country like Nepal.Airlines officials say that, given Nepal’s geographical terrain, climatic behaviour, and airport facilities, Nepali airlines cannot afford to be liable for delays.According to tourism ministry officials, the proposed legislation is a modified version of the Montreal Convention 1999 as there are several clauses that domestic airlines would not be able to comply with.Frequent ministerial changes have slowed it down, they say. Some ministers held their positions for long enough but were not bothered about pushing the bill.The bill could not be registered as Parliament was prorogued several times in the past.As a result of the delay, passengers who died in the Yeti Airlines plane crash in January 2023 missed out on compensation in millions of rupees.The Yeti Airlines tragedy in Pokhara was Nepal’s 104th crash and the third biggest in terms of casualties.According to Nepal’s civil aviation body, more than 900 people have died in air crashes in the country since the first disaster was recorded in August 1955.The biggest air accident took place on September 28, 1992, when an Airbus A310 belonging to Pakistan International Airlines slammed into a hillside at Bhattedanda near Kathmandu Valley, killing 167 people on board.Earlier, on July 31, 1992, an Airbus A310 of Thai Airways crashed in Ghyangphedi, killing 113 on board.Nepal’s domestic airlines—nine fixed-wing operators and 12 helicopters—flew 4.15 million passengers in 2023. \nSri Lanka’s rich culture, wealth of natural resources, and diversity of accessible experiences make it one of the world’s best holiday destinations. The most common sight across the island nation is the tank cascades system, an ancient irrigation infrastructure—a network of small tanks draining to large reservoirs that store rainwater and surface runoff for later use. Despite being cash-strapped and plunging into its worst financial crisis in more than seven decades in 2022, Sri Lanka is now bouncing back, thanks to the growing number of tourists. We spent five days in the island country two weeks ago, driving up and down the island, covering almost 70 percent of its territory. Following the trip spanning over 1,000 kilometres, including hills, beach spots, and heritage and religious sites, the Post presents a travel guide to Sri Lanka. \nEducation in Every Home’s report titled ‘Diversity, Equity and Inclusion in Nepal’s Textbooks’ highlights the lack of diversity, inclusivity, and inaccuracies in these textbooks.  The findings include egregious mistakes in textbooks like the inclusion of a letter Abraham Lincloln supposedly wrote—dating to a time 17 years after his assassination, to assertions like Brazil has tigers, elephants and rhinos while Germany has tigers and monkeys. The books display a clear bias in favour of Brahmin Chhetri males, while women make up just 18 percent of all people profiled. While 80 percent of all bylines are male, the presence of marginalised communities, especially Dalits, is nearly non-existent.  \n\nThe Araniko Project, which is also a popular blog, aims to uncover the past and present of the Nepal-China relations by using primary sources in Mandarin. A fluent Mandarin speaker, Rajbhandari, who has lived in Beijing for six years, has a master’s degree in Chinese politics from Renmin University of China.  In this conversation, she talks about Chinese historiography on Nepal, the nuances of Mandarin-to-English translation, Nepal-China ties and the importance of understanding Chinese language in order to understand the country. \nIt’s been 10 days since Upendra Yadav got reelected Janata Samajbadi Party-Nepal (JSP-Nepal) chair unopposed from the party’s general convention held in Janakpur.Nearly two weeks since the inauguration of the convention and the election of the party chairman, the JSP-Nepal, however, hasn’t elected any other office bearers and central committee members so far.Incumbent chief Yadav was declared the party chair unopposed after no one threw their hat in the ring.After Yadav’s reelection on June 12, the process to elect the office-bearers and central committee members, scheduled for June 13, was halted saying that all other leaders would be chosen in consensus.Before the party decided to halt the election process, 23 candidates—17 men and six women—had filed their candidacies for the five positions of vice chairpersons; six candidates were vying for two posts of general secretary. Twelve aspirants—nine men and three women—filed their candidacies for the three posts of deputy general secretary.Besides, three leaders were in the fray for a treasurer position; and 34 leaders had filed their candidacies for seven positions of secretary.To the question of whether the leaders had deferred the election finding it difficult to pick individuals for available positions, party insiders gave multiple answers.A leader linked the leadership election deferral to the party split in the first week of May.A group of JSP-Nepal leaders split the party and formed the Janata Samajbadi Party under the leadership of Ashok Rai. The Election Commission registered the new outfit on May 6.The JSP-Nepal led by Yadav on May 13 moved the Supreme Court, accusing the commission of recognising its splinter group as a party without the legal basis.Yadav, in his petition, claimed that the commission had registered the party even without the required 40 percent central members on its side. The top court has ordered the relevant authorities to stall the process until the verdict and the case is still sub judice.The uncertainty prevents the newly formed Rai-led party from expediting its activities in a formal way. Seven of the 12 JSP-Nepal lawmakers in the federal parliament and 30 of the 406 party central committee members are with Rai.The new outfit’s plan to build its organisation at the provincial and local levels is in limbo due to the delayed court process. Leaders from the new party claimed that a large number of leaders and cadres are waiting to join the new organisation. Moreover, they are planning to embrace those aspirants of top positions when they are denied posts in central bodies. Observers of Madhesh politics claimed that the JSP-Nepal was unable to complete its election process with the splinter faction eying to lure its members. However, Manish Kumar Suman, one of the aspirants for general secretary in the JSP-Nepal, denied it. He claimed that the stalled general convention process, including the selection of leaders for office bearers positions, would be completed within a week.“As per the election commission deadline, we have to complete the whole general convention process within 35 days,” Suman told the Post. “We will complete the process before the timeframe.”Some political observers say the JSP-Nepal went for the general convention only out of the constitutional compulsion. If the party really wanted to follow the democratic process, it should have allowed the election process to go forward.Article 269 (4) (B) of the constitution mandates the political parties to hold the general convention at least once in five years.“Upendra Yadav has made himself the JSP-Nepal patron,” Shiva Chandra Chaudhary, a Madhesh political observer, told the Post. “He can select leaders loyal to him, having been reelected the party chairman. So he stalled the democratic process.”On the other hand, the new outfit—Janata Samajbadi Party—too has failed to give momentum to the party building process in the six weeks since its inception.The new outfit has gained prominence apparently with the support of the ruling coalition. The Election Commission swiftly registered the new party on May 6 with the name similar to the mother party despite legal ambiguities in the process. The JSP joined the ruling coalition immediately after its formation and supported the Pushpa Kamal Dahal-led government. The Rai-led party has been given a Cabinet minister and a state minister. On Saturday, when the Cabinet made recommendations for ambassadors to eight countries, two nominations went to the new outfit’s supporters. Ambassadors for Saudi Arabia and Spain were appointed in the JSP quotas. Days after the JSP-Nepal withdrew its support to the government, the Rai-led JSP gave its trust vote to Dahal and it supported the government in its policies and programmes.Lawmaker Sushila Shrestha of the JSP tried to downplay the difficulties saying that they were carrying out the party’s activities quietly. “We are engaged in several activities to strengthen the newly formed party, but we are not visible in the media,” Shrestha claimed. “Next Saturday and Sunday, our party’s central committee is meeting.” Shrestha claimed that her party is stronger than the JSP-Nepal in the provinces except for Madhesh. “We have been holding the meetings of provincial committees and are working to make our presence felt in Madhesh Province too.”Though Shrestha claims there are a number of activities within the party, political observers believe that its activities are stagnant due to the case sub judice in the court. “A writ petition in the Supreme Court related to the party split has stalled the new party formation,” Tula Narayan Shah, a political analyst, told the Post.Yadav has claimed the commission registered the party despite its failure to fulfil the required 40 percent support of central members for a party split. JSP-Nepal had 406 central committee members at the time of the party split, but the splinter group only had 30 central members with it.The newly formed JSP was registered amid a legal void as the Political Parties Act 2017 was replaced by an ordinance but not revived afterwards. According to the Act, a group of dissidents can split a party and form a new one if they can prove the support of at least 40 percent of the central committee members and at least 40 percent of the party’s lawmakers.However, this provision was nullified through an ordinance three years ago, leaving no legal basis for a party split. On June 9, the Supreme Court referred the dispute related to the party to the full bench. \nProtests by employees at the Parliament Secretariat have affected deliberations on the national budget.On Wednesday, eight ministers were scheduled to answer lawmakers’ concerns about the budget for the fiscal year 2024-25 at the House of Representatives. However, the meeting had to be adjourned even before one minister completed his reply due to the employees' non-cooperation.The episode replayed on Thursday. Though seven ministers were scheduled to answer lawmakers' concerns, only four could respond. United under the Employee Union of the Federal Parliament Secretariat, the officials have been staging a series of protests. Starting Wednesday, they stopped working beyond office hours demanding allowances for overtime and odd hours.The agitators say they will not work before and after office hours until they are paid allowances. Office hours start at 10 am and end at 5 pm.“We will not be working extra hours without additional payment,” Govinda Belbase, chairperson of the union, told the Post. “Our non-cooperation continues.”As the protest started to affect House proceedings, Speaker Devraj Ghimire, together with Narayan Dahal, chairperson of the National Assembly, held discussions with Barsha Man Pun, the finance minister, on Thursday to address the demands. However, Pun did not respond positively.Shekhar Adhikari, Ghimire's press advisor, said the Speaker has taken the staff's non-cooperation seriously as it has hampered the House business. The Speaker has also raised the issue with Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal and Minister for Law, Justice and Parliamentary Affairs Padam Giri, but to no avail.Even before the formulation of the national budget, the Parliament staff had drawn the attention of Ghimire, Dahal, and Padma Prasad Panday, the general secretary at the Parliament Secretariat. Ghimire had requested Pun to increase Parliament’s budget and resume the allowances for extra work his staff performed.However, the money was not allocated in the national budget presented in Parliament on May 28, prompting the protest.Ekram Giri, spokesperson for the secretariat, said the protest has hit the House calendar. \"The deliberations in the budget are not moving as planned,\" Giri told the Post, adding that the discussions between the Speaker and the government have not yielded positive results. Parliament has less than three weeks to complete the deliberations on the budget and get it endorsed from both houses, Giri said. All the budget-related bills need to be authenticated by the President before mid-July. The new fiscal year starts on July 16.The budget-related bills are scheduled to be endorsed by the lower house on June 27, but that doesn't look possible following the protests.On normal days, meetings of the House committees were held in the morning while parliamentary meetings were conducted after 11 am. As the parliament staff have stopped working in the morning, no committee meetings have been held in the morning for days now.Parliament Secretariat staff claim that they have to work regularly before and after office hours without being paid a penny beyond their regular salary, while lawmakers get travel and meeting allowances, in addition to their salary, for attending the House and parliamentary committee meetings.Belbase said it has been three years since the government stopped paying the allowance.Belbase said that the House meetings, which generally start at 11 am, run beyond 5 pm regularly. The staff must arrive at least an hour before the meeting for preparations and stay an additional hour after the meeting.Protestors say they had been working over 10 hours a day for months without additional payment.It was an injustice to them and against the ILO Convention of 1930, to which Nepal is a party, they say.Article 3 of the Convention states, “The hours of work of persons to whom this Convention applies shall not exceed forty-eight hours in the week and eight hours in the day, except as hereinafter otherwise provided.”The allowance for government staff was withdrawn following the Covid-19 pandemic. The government resumed the allowance in some state agencies, including the Election Commission and the Commission for the Investigation of Abuse of Authority, but not in Parliament, said Belbase.“We are not going to compromise this time,” Belbase said. “This is a fight for justice.” \nFormer President Bhandari's renewal of party membership raises questions on the ethics of returning to active politics after receiving state benefits, with no clear constitutional guidance or policies on perks for ex-presidents.\nPrime Minister Dahal's question-answer session in parliament reveals dissatisfaction over low attendance, discusses India visit, recalls ambassadors, and addresses cooperative issues.\nCPN (Unified Socialist) gears up for general convention with top leaders lobbying for leadership positions, including former PMs Nepal and Khanal, as the party faces dwindling influence and struggles to retain members.\nA police officer committed suicide by shooting himself in the washroom of the federal parliament building in Kathmandu on Wednesday.\nPolice in Nepal arrest two individuals in connection with alleged cryptocurrency mining operations using a server and desktops at an information technology lab.\nThe Central Investigation Bureau has arrested three individuals on charges of embezzlement of over Rs74 million of the Kathmandu-based Square Savings and Credit Cooperative.Those arrested include cooperative chair Basudev Man Joshi, 66, of Kathmandu Metropolitan City-14; secretary Subarna Selalik, 67, of Kathmandu-25; and member Dharma Ratna Pachhai, 58, of Kathmandu-26.Superintendent of Police Hobindra Bogati, who is also the spokesperson for the CIB, said they were arrested on Friday. On Sunday, Kathmandu District Court remanded them for a week for further investigation.According to him, the cooperative operators have been accused of luring depositors with the promise of attractive interest rates but failing to return their deposits. \nDays after Kathmandu Mayor Balendra Shah joined the Nepali Congress in accusing CPN-UML chair KP Sharma Oli in a multi-billion-rupee failed land swap bid in Jhapa, lawmakers from the main opposition have backed Shah in his initiative to expand the sidewalks at New Road—something the UML opposes.Speaking in the House of Representatives on Thursday, Congress General Secretary Bishwo Prakash Sharma backed the mayor's plan to expand pedestrian lanes at New Road that clashed with the vision of the Road Division, led by a UML minister, to widen the roads instead. Lawmaker Sharma said that in case of conflict between a central agency and a local unit, the federal government should show more restraint than the local government.“Mayor Balendra Shah’s initiative to widen pavements at New Road is the right step for the general public’s convenience,” Sharma told the House. “Mayor Shah should be allowed to continue his work without any interference as what he is doing is absolutely right.”The conflict escalated when the Road Division, under the federal government, intervened and paved the road cut by the metropolis on Monday. The metropolis had cleared stretches a few metres wide on either side of the road to create space for pavements. The dispute resulted in a standoff between those deployed by the Road Division and the Kathmandu municipal staff, with different people taking different sides. The tension eased without any untoward incident as the metropolis backed off after the federal government deployed police at the site.The Road Division, under the Ministry of Physical Infrastructure and Transport, is led by Deputy Prime Minister Raghubir Mahaseth, who is a UML secretary. The dispute grew to involve those supporting Mayor Shah and the UML, the biggest partner in the Pushpa Kamal Dahal-led coalition, and also spilled over to social media.In Parliament, lawmakers from the main opposition Nepali Congress threw their weight behind Shah.Not only the party’s general secretary Sharma, two other lawmakers from the party also expressed their support for the mayor in the House meeting on Thursday. Congress lawmaker Arjun Narsingh KC said the conflict between the federal government and the Kathmandu mayor has raised serious questions about the federal government’s intent. KC stressed that cooperation and collaboration between the federal, provincial, and local governments is essential in avoiding conflict and resolving disputes between the three federal units. He said Articles 232 and 235 of the constitution and related schedules clearly define their jurisdictions.“The recent conflict between the federal and local governments and the saga of making and breaking of a road section have raised serious questions,” KC said. He urged the government not to resort to violence and to resolve the issue in a rational way.Another Congress lawmaker, Kanti Sejuwal, also speaking in the zero hour of Parliament, questioned the government for clashing with the municipal authority. “Either we should scrap the Local Government Operation Act 2017, or the federal government should let Balendra work.”As the Road Division intervened in Mayor Shah’s plan to widen the pavement in the New Road area, Sejuwal had expressed his anger at UML chair Oli.Following the federal agency’s intervention, the mayor wrote on social media, alleging Oli’s involvement in the attempted illegal swapping of land at the Birtamode-based Giri Bandhu Tea Estate worth billions of rupees. The largest party, the Congress, had been accusing the UML chief of being complicit in the land swap issue.A few days ago, Shah also engaged in a heated exchange with the KMC’s Ward 22 chairman Chinkaji Maharjan, a UML member, over the sidewalk expansion. Even before that, municipal staff dumped a truckload of dirt and trash outside the Kathmandu Road Division office, claiming that the delayed road expansion work from Kalanki to Maharajgunj had inconvenienced the public.Earlier, on May 14, the Congress parliamentary party meeting had decided to raise the issue of the tea estate land in Parliament. The Oli government, formed after the 2017 general elections, allowed the owners of the tea estate to swap 343.19 bighas (232.43 hectares) of land it occupied, based on a revision to the Land Act (1964). The Act was revised in January 2020, under the Oli administration, introducing a provision for allowing a swap or selling of land to pay off the tea estate’s liabilities if it went into liquidation. Asked if the Congress had backed the mayor as he alleged the UML chair Oli’s involvement in the Tea Estate land scam, the Congress publicity department head Min Bahadur Bishwokarma denied it. “Party lawmakers including the general secretary must have backed the mayor as the New Road sidewalk issue is of public concern, and not necessarily because it involves the UML,” Bishwokarma said. \nDead bodies of a man and a woman were found on a cliff in Dakshinkali Municipality-8, located on the southern outskirts of Kathmandu.According to the Kathmandu Valley Police Office, the bodies were spotted approximately 200 metres down the hill from the Kathmandu-Dakshinkali road.Senior Superintendent of Police Dinesh Raj Mainali said that the preliminary investigation suggests they died in an accident, as a crashed motorcycle was found near the bodies.Mainali said a disaster management team of Nepal Police is working to retrieve the bodies from the hill. He said locals informed the police after spotting the bodies on Wednesday evening.The police said the deceased woman is a 32-year-old resident of Changunarayan Municipality-5, while the man is yet to be identified. \nPrivate dairies have requested subsidised loans from the government to settle farmers' dues, amounting to nearly Rs3 billion, amid the ongoing dairy sector slump.They have also requested the government to permit them to export dairy products such as powdered milk, butter, and cheese, as consumption within the country has remained subdued. As a result, the stock has been piling up. Recently, the government partially bailed out the state-owned Dairy Development Corporation by providing Rs300 million in soft loans. After dairy farmers started protests, officials privy to the matter told the Post that the government is preparing to release another Rs600 million to the corporation. The corporation had in February said that the dairy industry was suffering from a recession and hoped that sales would increase in summer. But it didn’t.Both state-owned and private dairy companies said that the ongoing economic slowdown has dampened dairy demand, resulting in stopped cash flow and rising liabilities to farmers as products remained unsold for months.“We are unable to pay farmers due to unsold products. The stock, too, is huge,” said Prahlad Dahal, president of the Nepal Dairy Association.“So we have requested the Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock Development to provide a soft loan keeping our dairy products as collateral. We have also requested the government to open up exports so that we can sell our products and become able to pay the farmers.” The association is scheduled to meet the agriculture minister on Monday. “We hope that our request will be heeded,” said Dahal. The association has requested a soft loan for more than 50 percent of its remaining stock. Private dairies have stocks of powdered milk and butter worth Rs5 billion, said Dahal.According to the association, the committee formed by the agriculture ministry to study the payment issues of dairy farmers found that around Rs4.50 billion is due to be paid by dairies to the farmers. The amount was previously Rs7 billion.This shows that payment is being made gradually, Dahal said. “But that is not sufficient.”Consumer demand for milk and other dairy-related products declined last year, with the government hiking the price of raw milk to benefit and encourage more dairy farmers to join the sector. However, the unscientific hike hit demand amid the people's declining incomes due to the economic slowdown.Regarding price reduction to increase consumption, Dahal said private diaries have a high cost of production, so it will not be possible to reduce the price.The government also imposes VAT on dairy products like ghee, ice cream, and cheese. “If the VAT is waived, prices will come down, which can boost the sales,” said Dahal.According to the association, nearly 1 million litres of milk comes from the formal sector, which implies a daily transaction of Rs70 million.“If the soft loan is provided and export is permitted, we will be able to clear all the farmers' dues by September,” Dahal said.Dairy entrepreneurs said that the butter stock is gradually being cleared, and milk production has declined, balancing stock and output.Last Wednesday, dairy farmers demonstrated outside the Lainchaur-based Dairy Development Corporation, demanding immediate settlement of their outstanding payments. Police arrested dozens of dairy farmers during the protest.Around 50 farmers were arrested as they attempted to picket the corporation. According to the association, 600,000 families are associated with the dairy sector, contributing 45,000 jobs. More than Rs60 million cash flows from urban to rural areas daily, and the government collects revenue of more than Rs2 billion monthly.“The agriculture ministry has called us for a meeting on Monday,” said Amar Bahadur Kunwar, president of the Central Dairy Cooperatives Association. “Both private and government dairy industries have more than Rs5 billion in dues to be paid to dairy farmers.”Dahal said the state-owned corporation alone has outstanding dues of Rs2 billion to the dairy farmers.The corporation even issued a public notice on June 10 inviting bids to sell its butter and powdered milk. As per the notice, it planned to sell 200 tonnes of butter (15kg block) and 300 tonnes of skimmed powdered milk (25kg bag).In another notice on Sunday, the corporation fixed the skimmed powdered milk rates. The country currently produces more than 6 million litres of milk daily. The corporation purchases around 25 percent of it. \nIn Nepal, the festivals measure the economy. Last Dashain, the cash crunch forced consumers to trim purchases.After a year, the situation seems unimproved.“We are not in the mood to place orders for goods for upcoming festivities,” said Ram Hari Karki, president of Nepal Trans Himalayan Border Commerce Association. “There is no demand at all. It looks like a deep economic slowdown.”Usually, traders place orders for foreign goods, particularly apparel, three months before the start of Nepal’s key festival season. Even though traders bring some amount of goods, it may be costlier. Due to the appreciation of the US dollar and increased customs duties, the prices of goods and commodities may rise, causing difficulties for many ordinary Nepalis.“Goods are becoming costlier day by day. That is why traders are cautious this year about placing orders,” said Karki. “The demand for festivities has not returned to the pre-pandemic level.”There are no statistics about consumption during the Dashain, Tihar, and Chhath festivals, but analysts say it grows manifold compared to the normal time. Kumar Karki, president of the Nepal National Traders’ Federation, said due to subdued demand, they may see a business decline by 15–20 percent. In comparison, prices may rise by 20 percent in the upcoming festivals.Even during the summer, traders say the market has slowed down.“Despite the rising heat, the demand for summer garments and shoes has not picked up,” said a trader in New Road, the country’s central shopping hub. “The footfall of shoppers has declined compared to last year’s season, reflecting the decline in people’s incomes.”“Nowadays, only a handful of traders are planning their trip to China to order goods. We don’t see demand recovering from last year’s drop,” said Kumar Karki.Some traders say there is a shift in the trade.In the past years, China fulfilled 80 percent of Nepal’s need for readymade garments.However, according to three top traders who spoke to the Post, the market seems flooded with Indian goods, which are relatively cheaper.Currently, traders said, an average of 15–20 loaded trucks are entering from Kerung and Tatopani customs points to the north, carrying garments, shoes and slippers, raincoats, and umbrellas, among other items. Before the Covid pandemic, 50–60 loaded trucks used to enter Nepal from the Chinese border at this time of the year.Cost is the key factor in subdued demand.On Friday, the Nepali rupee plunged to an all-time low of Rs134.15 against the dollar. A strong US dollar has advantages and disadvantages. It has negative impacts on an import-based economy like Nepal.“While importing goods, we must pay 30 to 40 percent as customs duty. The high customs duty has made imported goods expensive,” said Kumar Karki. The government needed to ease customs through the coming fiscal year's budget and further tighten it, he said. Importing goods through legal channels is becoming more difficult day by day, especially at the customs, and this has encouraged the illegal import of goods. This has resulted in an import decline.According to the central bank's macroeconomic report, the inflation rate on non-food and services remained at 2.96 percent in mid-May this year, compared to 8.89 percent a year ago. The year-on-year price index of clothes and footwear remained at 3.46 percent.Market analysts, however, say that data presents different facts than the actual market scenario. Economists say that youth are the significant spenders, and demand has declined in sectors like education and restaurants, including consumption of goods and services, as many youths have migrated abroad to study and work.Economist Nara Bahadur Thapa said that import-related activities used to increase by 30 percent with the start of a new fiscal year compared to other months before Covid. However, the number of traders importing goods by opening Letters of Credit (LC) has declined in recent years.“From July to October, imports used to spike and cross Rs200 billion per month, but now, even with the rise in foreign exchange rate, it hardly crosses Rs150 billion. This shows that the demand has declined as a result of economic slowdown,” Thapa said.Thapa said that as people's purchasing power has declined, the demand for different goods in major festival times has declined. The salaries of government and private sector employees have not increased in the past few years. “People are not going to spend unless they have money in their hands.”According to the Department of Customs, Nepal’s imports declined by 1.84 percent to Rs1.45 trillion in the first eleven months of the current fiscal year, which ended in mid-June, compared to the same period last fiscal year.The country’s imports slipped 16.08 percent to Rs1.61 trillion in the last fiscal year. \n\nNineteen-year-old Ekta suffers from excruciating pain during her periods. It is far beyond the usual pain and cannot be managed with medication–she’s tried that multiple times. Taking one dose of Meftal (a period pain medication) is never enough. The pain is debilitating most of the time.Despite several visits to gynaecologists, her complaints have been brushed aside as normal period pains. She strongly feels that her pain is abnormal, but feels powerless to address her issues.“The pain is so bad, but I cannot do anything about it,” she says. “I can’t count the number of times that I’ve been told that my debilitating pain is normal,” bemoans Ekta, whose name has been changed to protect her privacy.The normalisation of period pains means serious reproductive conditions like endometriosis often go untreated. People with endometriosis experience severe pelvic pain because tissues like that found outside the uterus grow inside it. Other symptoms of the condition include heavy bleeding during and between periods and fatigue. There is no known cure for this condition, and symptoms can start from the first period onwards.A major challenge experienced by women with endometriosis is the disregard of their symptoms by the public and medical professionals alike. Due to lack of awareness about the debilitating pain typical to endometriosis, both the person suffering from the condition, and their doctors often underestimate their severity.Severe pelvic pain is a key indicator for diagnosing endometriosis, says Dr Reena Shrestha, a gynaecologist at Madhyapur Hospital. When patients seek consultation regarding the kind of severe pain that significantly disrupts their lives, they may undergo two types of tests: transvaginal ultrasound and diagnostic laparoscopy. These procedures are used to determine the presence of endometriosis. Endometriosis is a complex condition, says Dr Hema Pradhan, a consultant gynaecologist at Everest Hospital. Amongst all the patients she meets at her consultations, many frequently turn out to have endometriosis. But, she’s noticed that often patients often delay seeking treatment because period pains are often normalised.“Women who come to me with their symptoms often delay seeking treatment, because, regardless of the severity of their pain, they believe all period pains to be normal,” says Pradhan.Eighteen-year-old Rima (name change) has been struggling with excessive pain before and during periods for years. She also experiences pain while urinating during her periods. Rima has also been diagnosed with Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome (PCOS). The co-occurence of PCOS and endometriosis is not unheard of, although research on them has been minimal.“I can barely walk when I’m on my periods, but I’ve always been told that I should just learn to live with it,” she says.Despite knowing about PCOS, she discovered the possibility of having endometriosis quite later in life. She shares this because period pain, even excessive ones, have been normalised for far too long.The general lack of awareness of endometriosis, and widespread normalisation of period pains, often results in late diagnosis and treatment of the condition.Although there may be no cure to the condition, there are ways to manage its most severe symptoms. Furthermore, receiving a diagnosis can greatly help patients to understand the severity of their condition, according to doctors. “I’m incapable of doing anything during my periods. One time I had to leave the examination in the middle of my exams because of the pain,” says Ekta. “I can’t study, can’t work, all I can do is stay in bed and cry,” she adds.Dr Pradhan reveals another challenging aspect of diagnosing endometriosis. Sometimes the condition may not appear on ultrasound scans initially. Endometrial deposits may appear differently in women due to hormonal changes. Furthermore, symptoms may vary, with some being asymptomatic altogether. According to Dr Shrestha, once a gynaecologist confirms that the patient has endometriosis, they will certainly recommend methods to manage the pain. These include analgesics for pain relief, and home remedies like hot water bag massage.However, the main problem remains. Due to lack of awareness, most patients may only find out about their condition later in life.In some cases women only discover they have endometriosis when they face infertility. Endometriosis is associated with infertility, and 30-50% of people with endometriosis may experience infertility. This also exposes another troubling aspect associated with endometriosis. Ekta shares that her relatives often express concerns about her potential infertility.“They just make me feel bad that I might never get pregnant. And it makes me feel worse,” Ekta adds.Worldwide, endometriosis has been known as a scientifically under-researched condition. It has even been called the ‘missed disease’ because of inconsistencies in its diagnosis and treatment. Endometriosis has also been widely ignored by policy makers.Treatment for endometriosis depends on the individual, says Dr Pradhan. Some are treated with hormonal medication, and others require surgical procedures. The main way to combat endometriosis is timely diagnosis, and timely treatment, she adds.“Raising awareness, timely diagnosis, and treatment are very important,” Dr Pradhan says. \nLast month, a local from Sindhupalchowk district was brought to Sukraraj Tropical and Infectious Disease Hospital to treat a snakebite. Along with the victim, relatives brought the live snake in a bottle to show the doctor as proof.“The snake was a king cobra,” said Dr Yuba Nidhi Basaula, director at the Hospital. “Fortunately, the venom had not penetrated deep into the victim’s body, and after three days of treatment, the victim was discharged. We called a snake handler and handed over the king cobra.”Sindhupalchowk is a mountain district where venomous snakes were thought of as non-existent. However, incidents of king cobra bites in mountain districts like Sindhupalchowk suggest that venomous snakes have started migrating towards hill and mountain districts, and rising temperatures caused by climate change are the main culprit, experts say.Nepal is among the world’s most vulnerable countries to the climate crisis and has witnessed multiple extreme weather events over the past decade and a half.Evidence suggests that maximum temperatures in Nepal are rising at a faster rate of 0.056 degrees Celsius a year, compared to the global average rise of 0.03 degrees Celsius a year. Compared to districts of the Tarai region, those in hills and mountains have been witnessing a more rapid increase in daytime maximum temperatures, which could have helped venomous snakes survive there, experts say.“Not only in Sindhupalchowk, but a king cobra bite was also spotted in Godawari of Lalitpur district last year,” said Basaula. “Snakebite cases have started rising alarmingly of late.”Of the 31 patients admitted to the hospital on Sunday, 16—more than 50 percent—were snakebite cases. Doctors at the hospital say eight to ten snakebite victims seek treatment there every day, and most victims seeking care at the hospital are from the districts of Kathmandu Valley or from those adjoining the Valley.Each year, around 2,700 people, mostly children and women from Nepal’s Tarai region, die of snakebites, according to a March 2022 report published in The Lancet, a leading international medical journal.However, snakebite cases are vastly underreported in the country. The Ministry of Health and Population said that only 14 deaths and 1,220 cases of snakebites had been reported in 11 months of the current fiscal year. Officials admit that venomous snakebite incidents are being reported from hill and mountain districts, and the demand for anti-snake venom is on the rise. They attribute this rise in snakebite incidents to rising temperatures. “Health facilities in some mountainous and hilly districts—like Darchula and Bajura—have asked for anti-snake venom,” said Dr Hemanta Chandra Ojha, an official at the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division. “Snakebite incidents have been on the rise,” said Dr Hemanta Chandra Ojha, an official at the division. “With the onset of the monsoon, people living in the risk areas should remain vigilant.”Every year, the Health Ministry purchases around 25,000 vials of anti-snake venom and distributes them to around 100 snakebite treatment centres in the country.Officials say as snakebite cases surge, so will the demand for additional treatment centres. “This year, we are planning to set up an additional 15 snakebite treatment centres,” said Ojha. Public health experts have urged authorities to launch an awareness drive about the risks. They say people living in thatched-roof houses are particularly vulnerable to snakebites, as snakes often enter such homes in search of rats. They say people should be asked to keep their homes and surroundings clean, prevent children from playing in bushy areas, avoid venturing out at night, and use torchlights while walking in the dark.Likewise, women and children who have to work in fields and go to the jungle are at the highest risk of snakebites. Small children are at risk of dying from snakebites, as they do not tell their parents about the bites on time due to fear of getting scolded for playing in the bushes, according to doctors.“We should make people aware so that they seek medical attention immediately after a snakebite, using whatever means of transport they get,” said Ojha. “The faster you reach the hospital, the greater your chances of survival.” \nA 45-year-old woman from Dhapasi, Kathmandu was diagnosed with high blood pressure, high cholesterol and diabetes some six months ago. Doctors at the National Cardiac Center, who attended to the patient prescribed medicines and advised her to change her lifestyle and eating habits to control the ailments.“The patient, who was worried about her health conditions, took the doctors’ advice seriously and joined a yoga class in the morning, made a drastic change in her eating habits, and engaged in physical activities,” said Dr Om Murti Anil, a senior cardiologist. “Her blood pressure, blood sugar and cholesterol levels are now under control, and she has also reduced her weight. Now, she doesn't need the high dose of medicines like in the past. ”This was a common refrain among a few patients, who took doctors' advice seriously, changed their lifestyles and eating habits, joined yoga classes, and increased physical activity, which helped them control high blood pressure, blood sugar and cholesterol levels.Public health experts say changing eating habits, lessening body weight, and starting physical activities, including yoga and physical exercises, help control non-communicable diseases, which have emerged as a major public health problem in Nepal.Studies show that non-communicable diseases have emerged as a serious public health issue in Nepal, accounting for around 80 percent of total deaths. A 2019 study by the Nepal Health Research Council on the prevalence of noncommunicable diseases found that they accounted for 71 percent of the deaths in the country. The study primarily focused on behavioural risk factors—tobacco and alcohol consumption—and biological risk factors—raised blood pressure, overweight, obesity, abnormal lipid prevalence, coronary artery disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and diabetes. The findings showed that the leading risk factor for death in 2019 was smoking, accounting for 17.7 percent deaths, followed by high systolic blood pressure at 12.3 percent, household air pollution at 11.2 percent, ambient air pollution at 9.3 percent, diabetes at 8 percent, as well as high cholesterol, kidney dysfunction.Additionally, around 8 percent of the deaths were attributed to accidents, including road traffic accidents.“For many patients, doctors have to increase the doses of medicines, as every time they come for follow-up, their reports often get worse,” said Anil. “To reduce weight, change lifestyle and eating habits, strong commitments are needed, and very few people have such determination.”Many patients, despite knowing that they are at high risk of dying due to inactivity, do not change their lifestyle or start physical activity. Doctors warn that non-communicable diseases—hypertension, heart disease, stroke and diabetes, among others—could lead to a public health crisis if not addressed immediately. They blame a sedentary lifestyle and the consumption of processed foods as chief culprits for the growing burden of non-communicable diseases and obesity.They warn that people from all walks of life have been affected by the repercussions of changing lifestyles and food habits. Entire family members suffer if any member, particularly the breadwinner, faces serious health problems.Experts say continuous awareness campaigns about the rising prevalence of non-communicable diseases, the promotion of healthy lifestyles, and the start of yoga classes in community centres, schools, and open-air gyms could help lessen the growing burden of non-communicable diseases. “Physical exercises not only help in managing the disease conditions but also lessen the risk of developing non-communicable diseases,” said Dr Munkarna Thapa, information officer at the Department of Ayurveda and Alternative Medicine. “Along with physical fitness, they contribute to the mental well-being of people.”Meanwhile, department officials said that they have allocated a budget to promote open-air fitness centres, yoga classes, and alternatives, keeping in mind the growing burden of non-communicable diseases in society.Open-air gyms have been set up in public places, and the public can use them free of charge. Apart from setting up outdoor gyms, imparting training to communities and school students and promoting healthy lifestyles to reduce the major risk factors associated with non-communicable diseases, Thapa said.The department, which has already set up open-air fitness centres at the headquarters of all seven provinces, plans to set up 10 more such centres in the upcoming fiscal year. Several local units also have set up such facilities in their areas. \nIn a bid to address the problem of malnutrition in children under five, the Ministry of Health and Population has started imparting training to nurses and paramedics serving in Lumbini, Karnali, and Sudurpaschim provinces.Officials hope that a week-long training programme will help lessen the existing problems of malnutrition in those provinces.“Imparting training to combat malnutrition in small children is our nationwide programme, which we have started from Lumbini, Karnali and Sudurpaschim provinces,” said Lila Bikram Thapa, chief of Nutrition Section at the Family Welfare Division under the Department of Health Services. “Along with imparting training to health workers, we will also launch an awareness drive to improve exclusive breastfeeding practices.”Malnutrition is considered a silent health crisis in Nepal. The country has made significant progress in reducing stunting among children under five, which decreased from 57 percent in 2001 to 25 percent in 2022, according to the Nepal Demographic and Health Survey-2022.The report showed some improvement in the country’s overall nutrition status, but progress is not the same in all provinces.More than 16 percent of the children under five years in Lumbini Province are found to be suffering from wasting—the most immediate, visible, and life-threatening form of malnutrition.Wasting, a debilitating disease that causes muscle and fat tissues to waste away among children under five, decreased from 11 percent in 2001 to eight percent in 2022.Wasting or low weight for one’s height in children, if not treated properly and on time, is associated with a higher mortality risk, according to the World Health Organisation.The report shows that exclusive breastfeeding has been continuously declining, from 70 percent in 2011 to 56 percent last year. Health officials said that studies show that more educated and well-off mothers are less likely to exclusively breastfeed their babies.According to the report, the proportion of children who are bottle-fed rises with increasing mothers’ education, from 12 percent among those whose mothers have no education to 49 percent among those whose mothers have more than a secondary education. Use of a bottle with a nipple is the highest in the highest wealth quintile at 46 percent and lowest in the lowest quintile at 11 percent.Likewise, the proportion of children who are bottle-fed is higher in urban areas, 26 percent, than in rural areas, 15 percent. The use of a bottle with a nipple is lowest in Karnali Province at 11 percent, in Madhesh Province at 12 percent, and the highest in Bagmati Province at 43 percent.Exclusive breastfeeding is the highest in Sudurpaschim and Karnali provinces—74 percent each—and the lowest in Lumbini Province—36 percent.“We have allocated the nutrition budget to launch a nationwide awareness drive about the importance of exclusive breastfeeding in the upcoming fiscal year,” said Thapa. “We have also designated a nutrition focal person at every local unit who is tasked to discourage practices of promoting replacement feeding.”The report also showed that bottle-feeding practices started in health facilities. It showed that 22 percent of children born in a health facility receive mixed milk feeding (breast milk and fresh, packaged, or powdered animal milk or infant formula), as compared with 12 percent of those born at home. Bottle feeding is not recommended, as the nipple on a feeding bottle is susceptible to contamination and increases the risk of diseases among children, according to the World Health Organisation.Health ministry officials hoped that training for nurses and paramedics would help lessen bottle-feeding practices in health facilities.Doctors say breastfeeding should continue for the first two years or beyond, as breast milk lowers children’s risk of illness, promotes their recovery during illness, and remains an important source of nutrients for healthy growth and development.According to them, longer durations of breastfeeding have many health benefits for women, including reduced risks of certain breast and ovarian cancers and diabetes.Nepal had committed to increasing the exclusive breastfeeding rate to more than 90 percent by 2030, but the rate declined from 70 percent in 2011 to 66 percent in 2016 and to 56 percent in 2022. \nIn a world where acceptance and safety often seem difficult to attain, many queer individuals also struggle to find a safe space to express themselves. They have to hide their true self and face relentless judgement when going to public places like cafes and restaurants.This is the reality for countless LGBTQIA+ individuals. The need for a safe space for this community is not just a desire but a necessity—a space where one can be themselves. This struggle for safety and acceptance can be traced to crucial historical moments, such as the Stonewall Riots of 1969 in New York City.The Stonewall Inn was more than a bar; it was a refuge for the queer community. When police raided the bar, the community fought back. This series of violent confrontations, which began in the early hours of June 28, 1969, between police and gay rights activists, marked the beginning of the modern LGBTQIA+ rights movement. The spirit of Stonewall, the fight for dignity and the right to exist openly lives on in places like Inclusive Galaxy Restaurant in Kathmandu. Inclusive Galaxy beyond a restaurant is an ‘oasis’ for the queer community and beyond.Founded by Bishwaraj Adhikari, Mr Gay Handsome Nepal 2013, a human rights defender, the restaurant proves the power of safe spaces. It’s a place where the community can unite, free from the prejudice and hostility that often permeate their everyday lives.After years of working in the human rights sector, Adhikari and his partner developed the idea for Inclusive Galaxy. What began as a small cafe gradually evolved into a full-fledged restaurant, driven by the growing demand and support from the community.“In developed countries with strong LGBTQIA+ movements, you can find community areas like gay villages. These are created as safe spaces for people whose families and communities have excluded them. They also support new business ideas and pink tourism. I hope to see pink tourism develop in Nepal someday,” says Adhikari. His vision for Inclusive Galaxy goes beyond just being a restaurant. He aims to promote financial independence and empowerment within the queer community.Since its inception in February 2019, Inclusive Galaxy has become a key spot for many in Lazimpat, a relatively queer-friendly area in Kathmandu. The location is essential because the first LGBTQIA+ movement in Nepal started in 2001 through the Blue Diamond Society.Inclusive Galaxy, true to its name, welcomes everyone—queer and non-queer alike—to share a comfortable space. His vision was clear: to create a space where people of all genders and sexual identities could come together without fear of exclusion.“I didn’t want to make it exclusively for queer people because that would be excluding ourselves from society. Different groups need to live together and understand each other,” Adhikari explains.In the early days, the cafe attracted both queer and non-queer customers. However, when some of the residents learned about Adhikari’s identity and the nature of the clientele, there was a brief period of hesitation. “At first, I didn’t understand what was happening, but then I realised my identity was an issue for a few people. I believe people should be judged by others by their character, not by their gender or sexuality. Over time, as residents saw that we operated like any other cafe, they became more comfortable,” Adhikari reflects.Adhikari started Inclusive Galaxy to give queer individuals a place to be proud of themselves, counteracting the self-doubt and insecurity that hiding one’s identity can cause. This turned the cafe very quickly into a community hub. The journey was not without challenges, though. It was difficult to hire staff and cooks from the LGBTQIA+ community, and soon after the restaurant opened, the COVID pandemic made things even harder.Despite these difficulties, the doors of Inclusive Galaxy remained open. During the pandemic, many queer individuals, who were abandoned by their families or afraid to return home, found comfort at Inclusive Galaxy.Since many couldn’t afford to pay for meals, the restaurant provided free food from its resources. As the number of people needing meals grew to 20-30 daily, Adhikari started raising funds within the community.“During my time as an activist, many people came here not only for food but also to see an organisation where the queer community supports one another,” Adhikari says.“The time during COVID was difficult, but it brought me closer to the community.”Four years after its inception, the restaurant has garnered a loyal following. Sarosy Neupane, Miss Pink Nepal 2024 first runner-up, describes Inclusive Galaxy as her second home. She moved to Kathmandu to study in 2022. Being distant from her family, she started visiting Galaxy for meals that reminded her of home-cooked food. Over time, she grew attached to the café because of its welcoming atmosphere.“It’s heartwarming to see people from our community and different walks of life here. The founders even invite us to festivals like ‘Dahi Chiura Khane din,’” she shares.Neupane visits the cafe regularly and sometimes stays until 3 am, engrossed in conversations. “I hope more spaces like this can open in the future. If, unfortunately, this place were to close someday, I don’t think we’d have any other place to turn to,” she adds.Muna Chhetri, a trans woman who has been a loyal customer for three years, shares, “This is my safe space where I can truly be myself. I always feel judged in other restaurants, but that fear doesn’t exist here. It’s where even those who aren’t accepted at home can feel accepted.”Sahara Khadka Chhetri, owner of Pink Tiffany, Kathmandu’s first openly LGBTIQIA+ friendly restaurant and bar, frequently visits after managing the bar, appreciating the convenience of not cooking at home.She notes very few places like this cater to our community, and some even had to close during COVID. “As an entrepreneur, I know that sustaining these spaces is a challenge. But as more spaces like these open, they will make the way for a more inclusive and compassionate society.”The welcoming atmosphere at Inclusive Galaxy has also had a surprising effect on non-queer patrons. Samriddha Jung Rana, a twenty-year-old neighbour who identifies as straight, often visits the café and appreciates the importance of such spaces.“Previously, I didn’t know much about the queer community and didn’t care much. But now, coming into this café, I’ve been interested in their rights and issues. I’ve realised that we’re not so different after all. We are all human,” he remarks.The ventures like Inclusive Galaxy and Pink Tiffany have inspired hope for collaborative businesses between queer and non-queer groups. The recent initiative by the Nepal Tourism Board promoting Pink Tourism in April 2024 is a positive step. Still, Adhikari believes that more support is needed from the government and the private sector.Despite the progress, challenges remain. However, Adhikari remains optimistic about the future. He is working on plans to develop the restaurant into a homestay program in the future.“Like how different planets, asteroids, and stars make up a beautiful galaxy, people from all walks of life and identities make a beautiful society. I am happy that we are assimilating together in this space. We are not so different; we are all different and similar simultaneously,” he says. \nAditya Mishra is a Nepali chef and entrepreneur based in New York. Passionate about elevating Nepali cuisine globally, Mishra sharpened his culinary skills while staging at various Michelin-starred restaurants in the city during his time at culinary school. A recipient of the James Beard Foundation National Scholars Scholarship in 2023, Mishra’s early experiences inspired him to establish his own supper club, ‘The Sewing Tin’, alongside co-founder Akhil Upad.In an interview with Post’s Aarati Ray, Mishra discusses his restaurant in New York, serving Nepali cuisines there and the recipe for his signature dish.How did your cooking journey start in New York?At 14, I told my parents I wanted to be a chef, but they preferred I pursue a stable career like engineering, as many Nepali families do. So, I left for Louisiana in 2019 to study engineering.But, cooking never left my heart so, after a year, I left engineering college and moved to New York City. It’s been three and a half years and my parents only learned about it later. When my mom visited me in NYC and saw my dedication to cooking, she saw my passion and supported my decision.What sparked your interest in cooking from a young age?As a child, I was drawn to cooking shows on TLC. The glamour of cooking, eating, travelling and the prosperity of famous chefs was fascinating.Around age 16, I discovered Chef Anthony Bourdain’s groundbreaking book, ‘Kitchen Confidential’, which shed light on the reality of the culinary industry. I learned how he became a cultural icon in NYC, reshaping perceptions of chefs.I was also fascinated by chefs like Marco Pierre White, who was a mentor to Gordon Ramsay. Their stories of achieving fame while maintaining discipline intrigued me. But, as I grew older and entered the culinary world, I realised it was far from glamorous—it involved dedication and I am glad I persevered.How did the idea for The Sewing Tin originate?The concept of ‘The Sewing Tin’ came when I realised the stark contrast between the romanticised view of kitchen work and its harsh reality. Witnessing the struggles of many kitchen staff—economic hardships, immigration challenges and language barriers—I had to rediscover my love for cooking.During my internship at ‘Junoon’ restaurant, I met my co-founder, Akhil Upad, who shared my culinary enthusiasm despite his preparations for medical college. Together, we wanted to create a dining experience that was more personal and communal, offering fine dining with a sense of community.We wanted our food to tell stories, so we named our restaurant ‘The Sewing Tin’ inspired by the immigrant experience in NYC. When immigrants opened cookie boxes as kids, they often found sewing supplies instead of food.‘The Sewing Tin’ is like opening a cookie box and finding sewing supplies—something uniquely desi, or South Asian. How do you promote Nepali cuisine in New York City through The Sewing Tin?My partner is from Atlanta with Indian roots, while I come from Nepal, so our menu celebrates and reflects both cultures and heritage.We represent our respective cultures authentically. For example, we have a dish inspired by Newari cuisine called kachaila, similar to French Tartar. We present it as Tartar to make it accessible to our customers but infuse it with Nepali flavours, telling stories about its origins and giving diners a taste of my homeland.What do you think of the prospects of Nepali cuisine abroad?I’m on a mission to share Nepali food worldwide. I have served up dishes like chatamari and lamb sekuwa in my restaurant. But I’m still learning and want to explore more of Nepal’s cuisines. My big dream? To make Nepali cuisine reach more places because it’s got something special that can wow taste buds everywhere.How do you see the changes in restaurants in Nepal?The restaurant industry has deep roots in community and bringing people together, dating back centuries. While this core idea remains, modern restaurants have evolved, making changes to adapt to the times.Yet, in Nepal, despite the growing number of restaurants, many lack uniqueness and storytelling, focusing more on making money than fostering a sense of community.I’ve noticed a troubling trend of rising prices, especially for beloved dishes like momos, which makes people question if they're getting value for their money. It seems like profits are taking precedence over creating genuine, authentic culinary experiences.The industry is starting to lose the creativity and passion that once made it special. It might be time for chefs to shake things up, challenge the norm and bring fresh ideas to the table, revitalising the culinary scene with renewed energy and creativity.What challenges have you faced in New York as an outsider?Living in a bustling city like New York as an outsider has its challenges. But, this city is also full of opportunities for those who are passionate. If you stay true to your culture and want to share your story, opportunities are waiting for you.Even though it can be daunting because of the tough competition, the city appreciates determination and expertise. When I started my journey here, all I wanted to do was cook, eat and share the story of Nepal and its diverse cultures. Instead of focusing on the difficulties, I embraced the chance to follow my passion.What do you think about the criticism of blending Nepali food with modern culinary styles?Chefs care about their food—it’s like they’re sharing a story. They’ve put in a lot of effort to become skilled, so let them be creative. It’s okay to give helpful advice but don’t be mean just to criticise. Chefs shouldn’t also just copy what’s popular, they should cook what they truly love.

Even during a brief encounter, you can tell she has the patience needed to be a baker.“You can eyeball cooking, but baking is chemistry. You have to be meticulous. You cannot rush it, or it does not turn out as expected,” says the 21-year-old environment science student. She also runs the online baking shop Bakeleus. Recently, she has also started selling her baked goods beyond her online shop, with her first stall appearing at The Yellow House’s Night Market. Bakeleus’s menu lists a variety of offerings, including jams, granola, tarts, cakes, cookies, cupcakes and brownies. Baral began baking in 2020, during the lockdown, and launched her online shop last year.She grows much of the produce she incorporates into her baking, and believes we should all understand the origins of our food. “This connection fosters gratitude and a deeper appreciation for nature,” she says. Her background in environmental science, coupled with her affinity for the natural world, imbues her creations with a unique artistic sensibility. Each item she bakes is a testament to her creativity and experimentation, as she believes consistent practice is the key to mastery.Despite the demands of being a full-time student, Baral strives to accommodate orders, typically requiring a minimum of 72 hours' notice for delivery. She is a passionate and discerning individual, evident in the love she infuses into her baking. Additionally, Baral advocates for a zero-waste policy at home, ensuring that every scrap of food and all household items are recycled.Three easy to bake recipes you can try at homeMini carrot cakes Ingredients:38 g milk or yoghurt35 g all-purpose flour1/4 tea spoon ground cinnamon1/8 tea spoon ground gingerA pinch of cardamom1 tea spoon baking powder½ tea spoon fine sea salt2 large eggs, at room temperature27 g granulated sugar13 g brown sugar (or 39 g of regular granulated sugar)1 tea spoon vanilla extract27 g extra virgin olive oil33 g carrots, peeled and shreddedChopped walnutsCandied lemon or orange slices (optional for garnish)Cream cheese frosting56.5 g unsalted butter, softened113.5 g cream cheese, softened1/2 teaspoon vanilla extractA pinch of salt250 g powdered sugarDirections:For the cake:Preheat the oven to 195°C.

The vegetable is relatively cheap and used in almost all cuisines and curries. This ubiquity could perhaps be why someone might be snubbingly called an ‘aloo’ in Nepal, but the reference does not make potatoes less important.Why have them With zero fat, potatoes contain many important nutrients—vitamins B1, B6, Vitamin C, which is an antioxidant, minerals and fibre. Along with starch, it is a good source of potassium, copper, vitamin C, manganese, phosphorus, niacin, dietary fibre and pantothenic acid. Potassium derived from potatoes is an electrolyte that benefits the heart, muscles and nervous system. Potato skin contains fibre, which is important for digestive health.Compared to other vegetables, potatoes are more energy-dense. It is free of fat, gluten, cholesterol and sodium. The relatively cheap plant-based food is also a good source of carbohydrates. Filled with nutrients, one can get a lot of them by consuming potatoes.Sourcing of potatoesPotatoes thrive in diverse climatic conditions. The country cultivates potatoes on around 200,000 hectares of land—from the plains of Tarai to the mountainous region.Every year, Nepal churns out around 3,410,000 tons of the stuff. It also imports potatoes and potato products worth Rs 8.71 billion.“These imports include potato chips, frozen potatoes and fresh potatoes,” said Biswas Poudel, a senior technical officer at the National Potato Research Programme.As its cultivation is possible in diverse landscapes, even climate change does not affect potato farming, experts say. Types of potatoesRed and white potatoes are popular and widely available in the country. Lately, dark potatoes or blue potatoes are gaining popularity.“Red potatoes are highly popular,” said Poudel. “Potatoes that come in colour contain more nutrients. Darker potatoes are packed with antioxidants.”Potatoes that taste sweet are a good source of vitamin A, an important nutrient for immunity and eye health. Purple potatoes are rich in antioxidants, including anthocyanins that may prevent heart disease and cancer and boost brain health.Other benefits As potatoes contain important nutrients, they benefit human health in multiple ways. Iron, phosphorus, calcium, magnesium, and zinc contained in potatoes help the body build and maintain its structure and strength. Consumption of the vegetable that is rich in potassium, calcium and magnesium helps reduce blood pressure naturally. Potatoes also contain a significant amount of fibre, which helps in lowering cholesterol levels in the blood and ultimately lessens the risk of heart disease. Fibre also boosts digestive health.Compared to other green vegetables, farmers use only a minimal amount of pesticides in potatoes, making them safe to eat. Chips and french friesOf late potato chips and french fries are gaining popularity in Nepal. They are also popular dishes in most restaurants and people have even started making french fries at home. Children love potato chips the most. Intake of nutrients and micronutrients, fibre and antioxidants components depends on how potatoes were cooked or prepared for food.Consumption of a lot of chips and french fries can lead to added calories and unhealthy weight gain.“Fibre and antioxidant and other micronutrients of the potatoes may be lost while frying,” said Poudel. “As potatoes are a carbohydrate-rich vegetable, it is not necessary to consume them with rice, which many people do in Nepal.”Experts say diabetic people should limit their potato intake as they cause spikes in blood sugar. \nChicken eggs are a healthy, nutritious superfood, containing most of the minerals and vitamins a body needs. They are relatively cheap as well. They are a complete source of protein, credited with a reduction in malnutrition in children and pregnant women in recent years in Nepal.According to nutritionists, consuming eggs daily has multiple benefits including weight loss, reduced blood pressure and protection against infections.Sourcing of our eggs Nepal is self-reliant on chicken eggs. According to the Nepal Egg Producers Association, poultry farmers in the country produce 3.1 million eggs a day.“Our production is sufficient to meet domestic demand,” said Shiva Ram KC, chairman of the association.Sizes and types Eggs are mostly available in two sizes—big and medium. Big-sized eggs cost Rs450 a crate (30 eggs) while medium-sized ones cost Rs435 a crate. Pastured eggs or eggs from local chickens are also available but they cost more than double the price of eggs produced in poultry farms. These are called Omega-3-enriched eggs, which are more nutritious than those produced on farms. Nutritionists say such eggs contain higher amounts of Omega-3 fat and are high in vitamins A and E. Omega-3 fatty acids are also known to reduce blood levels of triglycerides, a well-known risk factor for heart disease. As pastured eggs are scarce, one has to directly contact farmers to buy them. Officials at the Department of Food Technology said that generally, pastured eggs are not produced in bulk, but they may be made available through some trusted suppliers. Why have them, and how many? As chicken eggs are rich in protein, most minerals and vitamins, there are multiple reasons to take them. A whole egg contains Vitamin A, Vitamin B9, Vitamin B5, Vitamin B 12, Vitamin B 2, Vitamin D, E, B6, minerals—phosphorus, selenium, calcium and zinc.“A healthy adult can eat 1–2 eggs a day without hesitation,” said Dr Atul Upadhyay, a nutritionist. “A whole egg contains almost all the nutrients a body needs.”What about the quality of eggs? No agency in the country is checking the quality of the eggs being sent to the market. The issue of excessive use of antibiotics in chicken is often raised but no one talks about the presence of antibiotic residue in eggs.Studies in other countries including India show high levels of antibiotic-resistant pathogens in chickens raised for meat and eggs.The Department of Food Technology and Quality Control examines the quality of processed foods containing eggs but does not check the quality of eggs per se. Experts say there is no mechanism in the country to ascertain the quality of eggs. It is also difficult to determine the quality of eggs by merely looking at them, for instance whether they have thick or thin shells.Other benefits Eggs help in weight loss and strengthening prenatal bone. They increase mental energy. The lutein in the eggs enhances skin’s moisture and the protein helps tighten the skin. Egg yolk boosts skin complexion, as they are high in fatty acids, nutritionists say.Daily consumption of eggs might lower the risk of stroke. Antioxidants lutein and zeaxanthin contained in eggs help prevent eye diseases like cataracts and age-related muscle degeneration. Choline in eggs is important for pregnant women and breastfeeding mothers, as it helps with baby’s brain development. \n“How much oxygen do you have for the summit?”I think this is the kind of question a film producer would ask. But when you're on the mountain, the answer is never clear.I have worked for a long time in the film industry and different art areas, especially photography and engraving.Working in various fields and drawing inspiration from them has become a new normal for me. I have made this approach my way of life without even realising it.I took responsibility for producing the last movie I worked on and shot the behind-the-scenes footage for a documentary. By doing so, I witnessed the entire shooting process and the journey of a movie.In the snowy highlands of Turkey, we had to endure the consequences of the changing climate to shoot ‘About Dry Grasses’, directed by Nuri Bilge Ceylan. The highlands used to be snowy in January, but by the time we got there in the same month, there was no snow. Nature was changing. It was responding to what was happening—to what humanity had done to it. In the end, it snowed, and we shot the intense snow scenes we wanted. But since most of our days were sunny, unlike what the director wanted, we had to shoot in the sunset and sunrise hours. As crew members, we spent many days waiting for the sun to set.Production requires creating opportunities, finding solutions, and being creative for a work of art to come true. For this, patience, endurance, calmness, and timing are necessary. On the other hand, nature wanted us to listen to it and wait for the right time.During that time, I witnessed many of nature's lessons. For example, I experienced extreme cold for the first time. We endured temperatures ranging from -33 degrees to +55 degrees. By listening to nature, surrendering to its forces, and working within its limits, we managed to persevere.No matter how much you prepare or plan during the pre-production phase, if you are working in nature, remember that nature will always have the final say.The film was completed, released, and connected with audiences. Its success at Cannes 2023 was followed by my trip to the North Pole for my project. I returned with a mix of wonderful developments, joys, and challenges. During this process, I experienced life and death, happiness and sadness, losses and awards.I realised the value of being able to breathe comfortably a few days after my father's chemotherapy ended. Just a few days earlier, he had said, \"Well done, my daughter. I'm glad you went!\" All the anxiety and hard work, filled with fears at the beginning, were finally behind me.Before going to Everest, when I was on the verge of giving up, defeated by my fears, I remembered my father's words. Everest reminded me of what he said while struggling to breathe, adding a turning point to my life.What does it mean to say ‘life’s turning point?’ How many turning points can there be in life?Who am I, and what am I doing in this world? How well do I know my own limits? Can I find answers to these big questions? These thoughts sparked my dream of journeying to Everest. Now, after returning, I can say that it turned my life around.“How much oxygen do you need for the summit?” sounds more like “How much do you need to hold on to life?” How many reasons do you find that give meaning to your life, keep you alive, and allow you to breathe? How much can you endure in the face of obstacles, and can you keep believing that a solution will eventually come your way?Can these questions be separated from the idea of measuring and assessing something, from learning its quantity and financial value? Can everything be known with certainty? Should the journey be fully understood in advance, with all its promises laid out? Should it be viewed like a purchase with a price tag, asking, “Is this journey worth this much?”I had never trekked before and had no climbing experience. I had lived at sea level my entire life and had never been to a high altitude.However, this journey was not only about the physical climb but also an inner discovery. After losing my father to lung cancer, his breathing difficulties taught me the fragility of breath, life, and existence. I also mentally prepared myself for the physical challenges I might face. Despite all my concerns, could this journey help me understand the cycle of life and the resilience of the soul?So, how could I make this trek possible? How could I land in Nepal? Despite all the economic difficulties and the many things I felt needed organising, I did my best and believed in it.Since I was embarking on this journey, I felt I should share about my travels and inspire others.Starting with photography, cinema, and engraving, which are already integral parts of my life, I dreamed of documenting and sharing the inspiring aspects of this journey.After months of correspondence and dreaming, it all came true. Finally, I embarked on the journey with the goal of creating photographs, engravings, and documentaries. I learned a great deal from my travels in Nepal, from the people I met, and from every moments I witnessed. I felt incredibly fortunate to have been able to honour my father’s memory with the peace and serenity I experienced in the Himalayas.During my 15-day journey to Everest Base Camp, I encountered nature’s masterpieces at every turn. As concerns like “How will I endure?” and “How will I finish?” started to weigh on me, the mountains suddenly parted with the clouds and gazed down at me.It was amazing to witness the appearance of ‘Gods’ that I had never seen before, in such immense size and in such a close, awe-inspiring manner beside me during that silent walk.As someone who came from one of the most crowded cities in the world, Istanbul, while I struggled with my daily questions and uncertainties, trying to control everything, they stood there calmly, as if answering me.They were just there—before and after.My guide, Lakhpa Sherpa, always reminded me not to worry about how high we were, how long it would take to reach our accommodation, or what the weather would be like. He encouraged me to live in the moment, and he was right.He advised me to focus on my breathing, not to get thirsty, to eat enough, and to appreciate the extraordinary beauty of the journey. In the mountains, plans dissolve and each moment is embraced as it comes.All the good wishes, prayers, and everything encountered along the way were for the journey itself. The mountain was full of life, secrets, and everything I had wondered about.This 15-day journey to Everest Base Camp was a solo adventure, yet I wouldn't have been able to complete it without my guide, Lhakpa, and my porter. Additionally, I was fortunate enough to experience the hospitality, generosity, and honesty at Trekkers Paradise, which organised the entire journey and provided guidance.I witnessed how dedication and sincerity are crucial in completing a journey safely and healthily. Ghanshyam Sharma, from Trekkers Paradise and Sauraj Jhingan, a climber who summited the Everest in 2018, shared their experiences with me during the journey.They experienced the 2015 earthquake while they were at the Everest Base Camp.As a filmmaker, their role as actors, and attention to detail played a significant role in bringing my dream photography and documentary project to life.The sponsors of my journey were Turkish Airlines, The North Face, Apple, Canon, and Stanley. My supporters include Oscar International College and Nepal Film Campus. Throughout the journey, I shared many experiences, memories, and countless photos and images with my students.On my way back home after 21 days, I celebrated my birthday on the plane. From the right window, the Himalayas bid me farewell. I felt like I had opened a new chapter in my life, and I was certain that I would return.I had made many friends and memories in Nepal.For now, I will be working on a documentary and preparing for a photography and engraving exhibition titled ‘My Soul Beyond the Mountain’.To the Himalayas: This summer was spent with you, but we will meet again soon. \nWe spent five days in Sri Lanka two weeks ago, driving up and down the island, covering almost 70 percent of its territory. Our tour spanned over 1,000 kilometres, including hills, beach spots, and heritage and religious sites.Our first stop in Sri Lanka was Colombo’s Bandaranaike International Airport. We were greeted by a warm and humid breeze when we exited the airport. The host briefed us (a group of journalists) that heavy rainfall has affected areas across Sri Lanka since mid-May 2024. Rain and storms intensified on June 1, with the most significant effects in the south and west of the country. We were lucky to have no rain in the forecast.On the first night, we checked into the lavish Jetwing Lake resort, an opulent sanctuary amidst the lush landscape. The resort’s expansive grounds were a retreat, offering a glimpse of Sri Lanka's natural beauty. We feasted on delicious cuisine, every bite exploding with flavour, introducing us to the island’s famed culinary delights. On June 7, early morning, the sun shone brightly, previewing the promise of an incredible journey ahead. We set off early the following day, eager to explore the mysteries of this enchanting island. As we ventured further into the heart of Sri Lanka, the landscape revealed its majestic nature. We were astounded by seeing Pidurangala Rock, a 200-metre-high granite colossus just a kilometre north of Sigiriya. The short hike to Pidurangala Rock offered breathtaking views of Sigiriya and beyond. We climbed the steep steps and soon were rewarded with a breathtaking panoramic view of the surrounding landscape. It took us 30 minutes to climb. The sight took our breaths away and left us humbled in the presence of such grandeur. From the top are glorious vistas of the surrounding landscape and an incredible view of the majestic Sigiriya Rock. From there, Sigiriya Lion’s Rock is visible, standing alone. This was the place where demon king Ravana had his palace in the Treta Yuga. Believed to have been built 50 centuries ago, the palace is said to have had a unique lift for Ravana and his visitors. Ravana imprisoned Sita in one of the caves at the bottom of this humongous boulder. Sigiriya is a fifth-century fortress in Sri Lanka carved out of an inselberg, a hill of hard volcanic rock that soared high above the surrounding jungle. We spent two hours atop the rock, mainly taking photographs. We descended from Pidurangala Rock, filled with awe and a sense of accomplishment.The journey ahead seemed even more enticing as we ventured along the winding roads, heading towards our next destination.Cash-strapped Sri Lanka plunged into its worst financial crisis in more than seven decades in 2022, with a severe dollar shortage sending inflation soaring to a high of 70 percent, its currency to record lows, and its economy contracting 7.3 percent.Thanks to the growing number of tourists, Sri Lanka is now bouncing back.In Jetwing Lake, we met Kasun Pradeep Somasiri, a receptionist. He briefed us that the resort is now 50 percent occupied. “That’s a better figure now as we are recovering.”The travel and tourism sector is a significant income generator for Sri Lanka. However, the economic crisis, the Ukraine–Russia war, and China’s zero-Covid policy have jeopardised the industry.Tourism accounted for more than 12 percent of the country’s GDP in 2019 and was the third-largest source of foreign exchange reserves, behind worker remittances and the apparel industry.Sri Lanka was poised to be one of the world’s best holiday destinations due to its rich culture, wealth of natural resources, and diversity of accessible experiences.However, tourism-dependent Sri Lanka suffered its first major setback with the Easter bombings 2019. This led to the collapse of inbound tourism flows as international arrivals declined by 18 percent year-on-year, and tourist expenditure fell by 17.7 percent that year. This was immediately followed by two years of pandemic restrictions. Inbound visitors fell to just 116,600 in 2021.An acute balance of payments crisis forced Sri Lanka to preemptively default on foreign debt of over $50 billion in April 2022, triggering a crippling economic contraction with spiralling inflation.“Tourism is gaining momentum,” says Somasiri. “The British and Chinese have started to return to Sri Lanka.”January-August is the peak season for foreigners. “From December to April, local people travel for holiday purposes,” says Somasiri. Before we started the tour to other religious sites, our tour guide, Sampath Mayadunne, told us, “Don't take selfies with your back to Buddha.” Turning your back on a Buddha statue and some other religious sites to take photos and videos is a strict no-no.The most common sight across Sri Lanka is the tank cascades system, an ancient irrigation infrastructure. The system is a network of small tanks draining to large reservoirs that store rainwater and surface runoff for later use.“These infrastructures were built by its ancient kings over 2,000 years ago to solve the water scarcity in the country’s dry zone,” says Mayadunne.On day two, we travelled to Ranweli Spice Garden in Matale. This garden is famous for its rare spices and herbs. A tour of the gardens will show you the cultivation, harvesting, cleaning, and packaging process, as well as the health benefits and uses of the herbs.On the way, we saw a colourful Muthumariamman Hindu temple, boasting hundreds of detailed sculptures in a rich mosaic of colour.In Kandy, we visited the Temple of the Tooth Relic (Sri Dalada Maligawa), one of the most sacred places of worship in the Buddhist world. It was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1988.The temple sustained damage from bombings by Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna in 1989 and by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam in 1998. However, it was fully restored each time.We then headed to Jetwing St Andrew’s, a luxurious 5-star property in Sri Lanka’s hill country of Nuwara Eliya, situated at 1,900 metres above sea level. During our stay in Kandy, we immersed ourselves in the city's charm and the serenity of the countryside. On the third day, early morning, we travelled to Nuwara Eliya, the area famous for tea estates that give many Nepalis the feeling that they have come to Kanyam, Ilam, in eastern Nepal.We visited a tea factory called Damro Labookellie Tea Centre, the oldest tea centre in Sri Lanka. Due to its cold climate, it is the most important area for tea production in Sri Lanka.In this tea factory, they make white and black tea, while the green tea is processed in another tea factory and then sent to Damro.After the tea factory tour and the tea tasting, we headed to Galle, our next resting point.We encountered narrow, winding, and maze-like streets and alleys in Nuwara Eliya, known as ‘Little England’. The town has preserved almost all its British-era buildings and is calm and beautiful. On our way to Galle, at the roadside, our tour guide stopped us at the famed Sita temple, which has Hanuman's footprints and is the place where Sita, wife of Lord Rama, was held captive by the demon king Ravana after he abducted her from India.We were at Sita Eliya, a temple named Sri Seethai Amman.When we reached the Hindu temple, rich in vibrant colours and architectural elements, it was full of devotees. The water stream adjoining the temple is believed to be where Sita bathed. Large footprints are found on the stones in the stream, and there is a saying that those belong to Hanuman, who came spying to find Sita’s whereabouts.In Ella, Ravana’s waterfalls are significant in the Rama-Ravana story. The cascade charms visitors from all over the globe. The waterfall is easily accessible and is known to have hidden caves at the top, which are believed to have been used as Ravana's residence.The 25-metre-tall waterfall is a beautiful cascade that provides the perfect backdrop for a photo to remember your Ramayana trail adventures in Sri Lanka. A short pilgrimage tour ended there, and it was now time for an adventure. Though it was not part of our itinerary, our guide decided to tour us on a train ride.Though short, only six kilometres from Ella to Demodera, it was thrilling. Everyone screamed in unison like kids on a fair ride to hear the echoes in the dark every time we passed through the tunnels. The sound of the train is subtly different inside a tunnel. For the first-timer, the darkness and shouts inside the tunnels when the train passes would be scary, like a horror movie.The train we boarded wasn’t crowded, but people had already filled the doorway, ready for the scenic journey.With the shrill sound of a whistle, the train slowly pulled away from the platform at Ella, passing houses, coconut trees and green fields.As the train progressed, tourists and locals were leaning out the windows and crowding to hang out the doors. I joined the crowd and hung out on a train. A short excitement ended there.After lunch, we headed to Galle and reached Jetwing Lighthouse. As soon as our group entered the hotel, they shouted with excitement.The hotel is on a rocky outcrop three miles west of Galle. Waves crash over giant boulders in front of it and produce howling winds.We were at Galle’s 17th-century fort five minutes from the hotel on day four. In the Bay of Galle on the southwest coast of Sri Lanka, Galle Fort was built first in 1588 by the Portuguese and lavishly rebuilt by the Dutch during the 17th century. It is a historical, archaeological and architectural heritage monument that maintains a perfect appearance even after more than 436 years.We then reached Hikkaduwa Beach, a popular beach destination on the southern coast of Sri Lanka. On the way, we saw a 30-metre-high Big Buddha Statue. It is a replica of the 6th-century Buddhas of Bamiyan destroyed by the Taliban in Afghanistan. It was created using the earliest known sketches of the statue. It was built in remembrance of the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami victims.We then travelled through the 222-kilometre-long Southern Expressway, Sri Lanka's first expressway linking the capital, Colombo, with Galle, Matara, and Hambantota, significant cities south of the island.On day five, we reached Colombo, the capital of Sri Lanka. Jetwing Colombo Seven hosted us in the bustling capital. We took a city tour early morning and visited Bally's Casino at night.On day six, we returned to Kathmandu early in the morning on a Sri Lankan Airlines flight, the airline that organised the trip in coordination with Jetwing Hotels Limited, a Sri Lankan hotel chain.National flag carrier Nepal Airlines, in its previous avatar as Royal Nepal Airlines, used to operate direct flights to Colombo during the 1980s. However, the carrier suspended operations following an armed movement by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) in Sri Lanka. There had been no direct air links between the two countries for decades.In 2016, Himalaya Airlines started a chartered flight that lasted a few months due to low traffic movement between the two countries. Sri Lankan Airlines started operating direct flights to Kathmandu in August 2021.“The main objective of this media tour is to increase tourism in both countries for mutual benefit. We want to draw Nepalis for pilgrims and leisure activities,” says Nilina Pathirana, Country Manager at Srilankan Airlines in Nepal.“We have understood that Nepali travellers tend to travel to Bangkok, Vietnam, Malaysia, Dubai, and Maldives. Nepalis have quite minimal knowledge about Sri Lanka and the religious connection between Lanka and Nepal. We want to promote Nepal and Sri Lanka jointly. This will be a win-win business,” added Pathirana.The airline said it currently carries 60 percent of the passengers from Nepal to Sri Lanka and beyond destinations like Tokyo, Sydney, Melbourne, and other Middle Eastern destinations. The return airfare for a 3.5-hour-long flight starts at Rs74,000. “We have a four-night, five-day package that begins from Rs80,000, depending on the properties and extended itineraries,” says Pathirana.Nepalis must submit certain required documents for visa processing, like their passport copy and bank statement. Due to this government-to-government policy, only Nepalis must obtain a prior visa. Otherwise, Sri Lankans are required to have a visa upon arrival.“The other best thing is that Sri Lankan Airlines can be involved with the visa process or facilitate the Nepalis tourists. Our main intention is to have a sustainable market in Kathmandu and make it a daily flight,” says Pathirana. \nMundhum Trek in Koshi province in the eastern part of Nepal is a new cultural walking trail. It passes through several indigenous ethnic villages and landscapes in Khotang and Bhojpur districts. This trail goes up to an elevation of 4,200 metres to the viewpoint of Silchung Peak and takes one through the settlements of the Kirati people. This route starts from Diktel Bazaar and passes through beautiful settlements like Chakhewa, Rawa Dhap, Salpa Bhanjyang, Silchung and Hanspokhari before ending in Bhojpur. There are some hotels in Diktel but trekkers are advised to carry tents. The trail offers panoramic views of most of the eight-thousanders, including Everest, Lhotse, Makalu, Cho Oyu and Kanchenjunga mountains. The spring season, March through May, is highly recommended for the trek.Janaki Mandir Janaki Mandir at Janakpur in Madhesh province was constructed in 1874 and is a blend of Mughal and local architecture. The temple is a three-storey building and has 60 rooms, making it the largest temple in Nepal. Pilgrims flock here by the thousands to pay homage to Janaki Mandir—Janaki being the other name of Sita, the daughter of King Janak. The temple houses an idol of Sita which was found near Ayodhya, the kingdom of Ram. The marriage anniversary of Lord Ram and Sita is celebrated in Janakpur every year on Vivaha Panchami, which falls in December. In the southwest corner of Janaki Mandir is the Vivaha Mandap, which has been built at the site where the marriage of Ram and Sita is said to have taken place. Another well-known temple in the vicinity is Ram Mandir, which is built in pagoda style and is hence different from the other temples in Janakpur that generally bear resemblance to Mughal architecture. It houses a female statue, said to be of Yogamaya, which has the reputation of being one of the most beautiful images of female forms in Nepal. Other holy sites of interest include the Laxman Temple, Sankat Mochan Temple and Hanuman Temple.Kuri Village, Kalinchok Kuri village, a popular tourist destination around 150 km from Kathmandu, lies at an altitude of 3,842 metres above sea level in Kalinchowk of Dolakha district, in Bagmati province. People visit the place to enjoy the snow during the winter besides the mesmerising landscapes and splendid panoramic view of the Himalayan range. Kalinchok gets snow mainly at the end of December and the snowfall continues till the end of February or mid-March. When there is snow, it is difficult for jeeps, buses and cars to reach the top of Kuri village. Chains are wrapped around the wheels of vehicles and specially modified jeeps with highly experienced drivers are used to carry visitors. There are several hotels and restaurants in the area. The road up to Kuri has also improved over the years.Annapurna Base Camp Annapurna Base Camp trek, in Gandaki province, makes for a picturesque journey that takes you to the foothills of the Annapurna South, up to 4,130 metres above sea level. The five-day trek (seven days for slow walkers) offers rich cultural diversities, typical Nepali villages and the flora and fauna nestled at the foothills of Annapurna. The distance from Pokhara to Annapurna Base Camp is approximately 81 kilometres. It is among the shortest and most budget-friendly treks in Nepal. For Nepalis, lodging costs around $5 to $10 per day. For foreigners, the overall cost of the trek ranges from $800 to $1500 on average per person. Annapurna Base Camp trek can be done at any time throughout the year as each season offers a different trekking experience. The ideal time for the trek depends on your weather preferences and what you expect from it. However, autumn (September to October) and spring (March to May) are considered the two best seasons for the trek, as the days at the time are warm and bright with clear skies.Bardiya National Park Bardiya National Park, located in the southern Tarai belt of Lumbini province, is home to one of the most elusive and majestic animals on earth—the Royal Bengal Tiger. The park, which covers an area of 968 square kilometres, is considered one of the most important protected areas in the country. It is a prime destination for those looking to catch a glimpse of a tiger. A bit of luck and patience will offer a good chance to see the Bengal Tiger. The jungle safari also offers one the opportunity to spot Asian elephants and the greater one-horned rhinoceros. The rare Gangetic river dolphins are occasionally spotted on rafting trips along the Geruwa River, the eastern channel of the Karnali river. Besides, visitors can enjoy the homestays and explore local Tharu culture. The right time to visit the park is from mid-September to mid-December and mid-February to May.Khaptad National Park Khaptad National Park in Sudurpaschim province is a protected area in the far western region. It stretches over four districts of Bajhang, Bajura, Achham and Doti and ranges in elevation from 1,400 to 3,300 metres. The park can be visited throughout the year. Trekkers are advised to bring their tents, food and other supplies. The Nepal Tourism Board says of late, social media has been increasingly influencing Nepali travellers to go to Khaptad. Since the far-flung Khaptad National Park is still offbeat for many travellers, the area remains pristine and fresh. The seasons of spring (March-May) and autumn (October-November) are the ideal times to visit the park. The temperature ranges from 10°c to 20°c offering pleasant trekking weather. The monsoon begins in June and lasts until September and during this time, roads often become muddy and slippery. From December to February, winter brings snow and chilling winds to the park.Limi Valley \nOnce again, my heart swelled with joy when my hometown came into view.Arriving at Lalikharka after the treacherous journey through Pauwa Bhanjyang and the bustling Kanchhi Dokan, Phidim, the headquarters of Panchthar district, revealed itself like a surprise gift. My home town, Phidim, is unique in the fact that it reveals to travellers approaching it from uphill. As the vehicle descends the mountain road, it slowly comes into view, its houses and buildings recognisable for the native son.This Dashain, I undertook the much-awaited trip to my hometown with my wife Kabita and daughter Aarohi. Little did I anticipate the transformation that awaited me.The moment I got out of the jeep, I noticed that Phidim, nestled in the lush hills, has undergone a remarkable transformation over the years. As I guided my family to my home, which had suffered damages in the 1989 quake that struck eastern Nepal, I found that old, mud and stone houses had been replaced by concrete buildings. The place was vastly different from the one I remembered.Arriving at my childhood home felt like reuniting with an old friend. Navigating its nooks and crannies with my daughter, we delved into the history of the house, a symbol of my cherished memories.My wife had visited Phidim years ago, spending a month with my parents. She, too, recalled beautiful moments she had had in the town. I asked the tenant about the neighbours and acquaintances. Some had died, while others had left for good.A call to local journalist Giriraj Banskota led me to the school grounds, where memories flooded back. This was where I spent my teenage years, playing ball, learning to kick, and watching major tournaments. Here, I even encountered a group of Western climbers headed to Kanchenjunga, the world’s third-highest mountain. I remember being awed by their shiny yellow tents, headlights and strange smell. I remember practising my tutephuteko Angrezi with the climbers. Birendra Shield, an annual sports tournament named after the late king, brought ace players from various schools in Panchthar district. The district also hosted Yuba Mela, an annual three-day fair to commemorate the birthday of the king, organising football tournaments in which teams from as far as Sunsari and Taplejung participated. I never excelled at dribbling balls. A boy growing up in a seven-member family, I soon found my interest in literature. In the late 1980s, Phidim hosted a major literary festival. In the run-up to the 1990 pro-democracy protest, walls were painted with anti-monarchy slogans, local politicians were arrested. I took my family to my school, Naya Namuna Secondary School. It was Saturday, so the school was closed. I peeked through the steel gate and wall, imagining myself labouring over classes. Memories are hazy, but what I remember most is going out of the school—to quiz contests with me leading the school team, to essay competitions at the District Education Office and to play carom board, a national pastime, in a nearby shopfront. Returning to the main street, the demolition of a landmark gate made me reflect on how cities transform, shedding old landmarks for new identities. Navigating narrow alleyways, I felt like a stranger in my own hometown. Multistory buildings have emerged and roads have been paved, reshaping the town. It’s the same place with a different face, leaving me nostalgic for the Phidim of my memories.We finally reached Shivalaya temple, which I told my wife and daughter was one of my cherished hangouts. A giant statue of Falgunanda (the Kirant leader’s birthday is celebrated on November 10) stood before the steps to the temple. Though my wife suspected I came here to smoke, in reality, I visited the temple in the evening to meet friends and talk about issues that mattered most to us at the time. It also offered a panoramic view of the town (I could not take my family to Gadhi Danda, a hillock across the Shivalaya).Towards the end of my journey, I felt sad about Phidim’s lack of prospects. To my dismay, I found that people have been leaving the town in droves. Despite blacktopped roads and multi-story buildings, Phidim faces a troubling reality. The lack of quality higher education and specialist healthcare has driven people away, echoing the circumstances that led me to Kathmandu years ago. Conversations with locals confirmed a mass exodus from the town, a trend that raises concerns about Phidim's future.My conversations with familiar strangers led me to conclude that Phidim has transformed into a transit town for pilgrims heading to Pathibhara Devi Temple, which is around 255 kilometres north in Taplejung district. I met dozens of people headed to the holy site. While pilgrims see it as a stopover, for me, it was a homecoming. The realisation dawned that Phidim is, perhaps, in a state of transition, trading its rustic charm for the hallmarks of urbanisation. While I left Phidim for higher education in Kathmandu, people from rural areas have flocked to the town in search of better opportunities, bringing life and energy to the once quiet community.As we bid adieu to my hometown, I couldn’t help but reflect on the inevitability of leaving a place, no matter how enamoured one is with it. Passing Kanchhi Dokan, I pointed out Kanchnajungha and Kumbhakarna to my daughter—symbols of my childhood. Phidim, now a blend of nostalgia and change, remains etched in my heart, a testament to the intricate dance between memory and evolution. \nThe gate leading inside the city of Lucknow proudly declares, “Muskuraiye aap Lucknow mein hain” (Smile because you are in Lucknow). During my brief stay, the city lived upto its promise. Known as the city of Nawabs, with a rich history going centuries back, the city is abuzz with autos, rickshaws, honks of public buses and the constant loud sounds of the metro going over your head, irritable honks of public buses and food that leaves you wanting more.In such a happening place stands Bara Imambara, built in 1784 by Asaf-ud-Daula. ‘Bara’ means big, and ‘Imambara’ is a building with a big hall where people assemble for mourning congregations. This building was originally built to provide employment for the public because, at that period, the country was going through a famine, and it was seen as a relief project. I walked through the grand entrance gate known as Rumi Darwaza (Turkish Gate), wiping my sweat and fighting the Lucknow heat, entering the vast complex. Echoing in all corners was a voice from the speaker that kept reminding the visitors of the many rules inside the historical place. I tried not to let the wonder overwhelm me as I walked through the complex. To my right stood the elegant Asafi Mosque, recently painted in cream-like white. Its design is visually pleasing and a testament to the Mughal era’s artistic finesse. Its walls are adorned with intricate calligraphy and elegant designs, reminiscent of a time when such aesthetics held great importance. I couldn’t help but admire the tremendous effort the craftsmen put into bringing the Nawab’s vision to life, meticulously crafting the elegant domes which seemed to touch the sky. The mosque’s serene atmosphere stands in stark contrast to the bustling city just beyond its walls.Upon stepping into the main hall—known as Asafi Hall—I was immediately struck by its sheer size. It is vast and impressive, appearing to stretch into eternity, and its massive arched roof seemed to defy gravity. What’s even more intriguing is that it stands without the support of pillars or beams. The interlocking system of bricks, a hidden secret, upholds this colossal structure, leaving one in awe of the brilliance of the builders of the past.This very hall houses a large vaulted central chamber with the tomb of Asaf-ud-Daula. Standing beside his tomb was a chilling moment, knowing that the remains of a great historical figure was resting just a few feet below. After scanning the large hall, the guide took me to my favourite part of the Imambara—the labyrinth or the Bhool Bhulaiyaa. This labyrinth sits right above the main hall, and because the hall is unsupported, the ceiling had to be lightweight, so the hollow labyrinth was born. It is quite impossible to figure out the Bhool Bhulaiyaa on your own, as it is a confusing network of corridors and staircases. So, it is necessary to have the company and guidance of a guide.As I moved with my guide through the maze, I thought I could feel the presence of the past inhabitants who had walked through these confusing passageways. What fascinated me most was the maze’s design: every sound, no matter how faint, echoed through the structure, enhancing its aura of mystery.The guide whispered from a distance, his head close to the wall, and the sound reached my ears, even though he was out of sight. It felt as if the walls carried the whispers. We exchanged astonished glances. When the guide reappeared, he smiled and remarked, “Now, you understand why they say that walls have ears.”Exiting the maze, I climbed to the roof, which offered a breathtaking view of Lucknow. The city spread out in front of me, its modern skyline contrasting the monument’s historic charm. It was a moment of reflection, contemplating how centuries had passed, and yet, Bara Imambara stood as a timeless witness to the changing tides of history. As I stood there, taking it all in, I felt recharged by the air coming in from all directions. After descending from the terrace, my brisk guide led me to the final stop in the Imambara, Shahi Baoli (Stepwell). Also referred to as the royal stepwell, it sits underground and is another example of architectural brilliance in the complex. This didn’t surprise me much since it was built at a time when architecture wasn’t just functional but also a work of art.The moment I descended the steps that led me underground, I noticed the sudden drop in temperature. The Shahi Baoli served as a cool refuge during the blistering summer day. The well-planned architecture of the Baoli allowed it to naturally regulate its temperature. The way to the main well is locked, but visitors can throw coins through jail-like doors into the well in order to try out their luck, much like we do in Davis Falls in Pokhara.Entering the underground corridors, I felt a slight chill because it was cold and dimly lit. I turned on my phone’s flashlight and saw the walls adorned with intricate Mughal carvings. Upon reaching a spot where we could see the well, the guide informed us that the well acted as a CCTV camera at the time. He explained that individuals inside the structure could discreetly observe those entering, as their reflections would be visible on the well’s water, but the people entering could not see the people inside the building.I waited to see that happen, and when a group entered through the gate, I was stunned; their faces were perfectly mirrored on the water’s surface, showcasing the ingenuity behind the well’s design, serving both as a water source and a security measure.My experience at Bara Imambara was a delightful one. I had never seen such a remarkable work of architecture before—it is beautiful, interesting and ahead of its time. \nBrazil missed a string of chances and were left to rue a lack of quality in the final third after they were held 0-0 by Costa Rica in their Copa America Group D opener in Los Angeles on Monday.Brazil, who came into the Copa America on the back of a run of poor results in recent months, dominated possession but lacked precision in front of goal with just three of their 19 shots on target.“Now it’s about being honest with ourselves, creating alternatives to create chances, scoring, results are important in this competition, points left at the beginning can complicate things at the end,” Brazil defender Marquinhos said.They were frustrated by a resolute five-man Costa Rican defence, who looked to contain their opponents and deprive them of space. The strategy paid dividends even if Gustavo Alfaro’s side rode their luck at times.Raphinha had an excellent early opportunity to score after latching onto a long ball over the top from Rodrygo, but Costa Rica keeper Patrick Sequeira came quickly off his line to snuff out the danger.Brazil thought they had got the breakthrough in the 30th minute when a free kick was flicked on by Rodrygo into the path of Marquinhos, who poked it in at the far post but the goal was disallowed for offside after a lengthy VAR delay.The one-way traffic continued after the break and Lucas Paqueta rattled the woodwork with a long-range effort in the 63rd minute before a venomous Guilherme Arana strike was kept out by a fine save from Sequeira.Coach Dorival Junior brought on youngsters Endrick and Savio in the 70th minute as Brazil desperately sought a winner but Paqueta twice shot wide in the final 10 minutes as the nine-times champions failed to break the deadlock.“We played a great game, we fought until the end, I had three chances myself, we were frustrated not to win, but we left with confidence, we fought,” Paqueta said.“We played our game, we have to improve our finishing, myself in particular and other players, so that we can win.”Brazil’s all-time leading scorer Neymar, who has been sidelined by an anterior cruciate ligament injury, cut a dejected figure as he looked on from the stands.Colombia lead Group D following their 2-1 win over Paraguay earlier on Monday. \nJames Rodriguez evoked memories of his breakthrough performance at the 2014 World Cup on Monday after the Colombia midfielder set up both goals in his team’s 2-1 win over Paraguay in their Copa America opener.The 32-year-old won the Golden Boot in Brazil a decade ago, his volleyed effort against Uruguay in the round of 16 still regarded as one of the World Cup’s best ever goals, but his career has been on a downward track over the last few years.After playing for the likes of Real Madrid and Bayern Munich, Rodriguez joined Brazilian side Sao Paulo last year, making it his fourth club in as many seasons.He played at Everton in 2020/2021 before being sold to Qatari side Al-Rayyan and then joining Olympiakos on a free transfer.However, the Colombia captain was the difference in Monday’s Group D game in Houston, Texas and was named Man of the Match.“I’m very happy, it’s important to start well today against a tough opponent like Paraguay,” Rodriguez told Caracol Gol.“We could have done better in the second half, but you correct things better when the team wins, it’s much easier that way.”More than 60,000 Colombian fans at Houston’s NRG Stadium gave Rodriguez a standing ovation as he left the field in stoppage time following a performance that has them hopeful of lifting the continental trophy again after a 23-year wait.“It’s beautiful, they are supporting us a lot. We have a long way to go in this Copa America and we’re taking it one game at a time,” Rodriguez added.Colombia next face Costa Rica on Friday before taking on Brazil four days later. \nItaly qualified for Euro 2024's last 16 with a 1-1 draw against Croatia, who are in danger of being eliminated despite Luka Modric's goal, while Spain topped Group B.\nSpain clinched a third straight Group B win in Euro 2024 with a 1-0 victory over Albania, securing their spot as group winners while resting key players.\nA battery factory fire in South Korea killed 22 workers, mainly Chinese nationals, after multiple explosions ignited a warehouse containing 35,000 battery cells.\nRussian guided bombs shattered an apartment building in Ukraine’s second-largest city on Saturday, killing three people, injuring 52 and prompting President Volodymyr Zelenskiy to call for more help to deal with the growing threat of such weapons.Pictures posted online showed parts of the five-storey apartment building in ruins, with windows smashed, balconies wrecked and rubble strewn about a crater on the ground.Prosecutors in Ukraine’s eastern Kharkiv region put the casualty toll at three dead and 52 injured in the mid-afternoon attack, including three injured children. Regional Governor Oleh Syniehubov said four of those hurt were in serious condition.“This Russian terror through guided bombs must be stopped and can be stopped,” Zelenskiy wrote on Telegram.“We need strong decisions from our partners to enable us to stop the Russian terrorists and Russian military aviation right where they are.”Later, in his nightly video address, Zelenskiy said Russian forces had used more than 2,400 guided bombs on Ukrainian targets in June alone, with about 700 aimed at Kharkiv.He said after US Congress gave delayed approval of a big aid package in April, Ukraine's replenished arms supplies had reduced the devastation and frequency of missile attacks and the same had to be done now to fend off these bombs.“The significant reduction in Russian missile terror against Kharkiv and the region proves it is entirely possible to secure our cities and communities from Russian bombs,” he said.Ukraine, he said, needed promised military aid packages “without delay so that the agreements we reached with (US) President Biden can be realised.”Ukraine and the US signed a 10-year bilateral security agreement this month aimed at bolstering Ukraine's defense against Russia and getting Ukraine closer to NATO membership.Russia has relied increasingly on relatively inexpensive guided bombs, dropped from a distance and involving fewer risks for its forces.Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022 and has advanced slowly through Donetsk region in the east, capturing a string of villages since seizing the key industrial town of Avdiivka more than three months ago.It launched a cross-border incursion north of Kharkiv last month, though Zelenskiy says the situation there has stabilised.In the latest bomb attack, Mayor Ihor Terekhov said there had been four strikes on Kharkiv.Regional governor Syniehubov said rescue work was proceeding at the building, which housed a store on the ground floor.Kharkiv Police Chief Serhiy Bolvinov told public broadcaster Suspilne that three floors had collapsed, but he believed no one was trapped under the rubble.Kharkiv lies about 30 km (20 miles) from the border with Russia. The city of 1.3 million people has frequently been targeted in Russian attacks during nearly 28 months of war.Moscow denies deliberately targeting civilians but thousands have been killed and injured in the war. \nProminent Bangladeshi-Swedish author Taslima Nasrin's books in Nepal, despite being unauthorized translations, have sparked concerns among publishers and literary figures, highlighting the prevalence of copyright violations in the Nepali book market, with unapproved translations of other international bestsellers also being sold.\nBharat Budha, chair of Putha Uttarganga Rural Municipality’s ward 10, knows that many youths from his village have made it to the United States via ‘tallo bato’—backdoor route—and that many are still on the way. He also knows that eight of them have been deported from the country and that they have lost a cumulative Rs45 million in the process. The deported youths say that they returned home empty-handed after facing unspeakable ordeals and lost Rs6 million each on average.The Tak village in Rukum East—a close-knit settlement of 425 houses—was considered the Maoists’ ‘base area’ during the insurgency. Village youths who reached the US through illegal routes and got deported have lost an estimated Rs40 million. The number of those who returned without completing the journey and the amount they lost remain unknown.To get to the US, the youths have taken loans at up to 36 percent interest per annum from their relatives and village landowners. In Tak village, at least one person each from half of the households has gone abroad, Budha said. “Youths started going to America about six-seven years ago,” he said. “If they could gather enough money, the whole village would try to go to the US.” Budha’s own son had reached the US illegally in 2017, spending Rs3.2 million.During the insurgency, outsize slogans of revolution would adorn the walls of houses in the village. Hoping for a better life, people from all walks of life helped out the Maoists. But now, village youths are paying the agents to illegally get to the US—a country that the Maoists used to call their ‘enemy’, an ‘imperialistic force’. This has cost the Tak village much and in multiple ways.Death of a dreamSome of the deported youths have chosen to flee the village altogether, burdened with debt and creditors’ pressure. At least five such families have already left, said a resident. The family of Ram Budha was one of them. On April 28, 2015, Ram, who had returned to Nepal after working in Malaysia for eight years, took the illegal route to the US. He travelled through arduous trails for months and finally arrived in the country. Upon reaching the country, he was detained and had to stay at the detention camp for 27 months. When his refugee application was rejected, he was deported to Nepal in mid-December 2019. He lost Rs4.5 million in the process. He now owes over Rs6 million to creditors. “After the creditors began to put pressure on me, I couldn’t live in the village peacefully,” said Ram, who currently runs a vegetable farm in Tarakeshwar, Kathmandu.While those who got to the US through illegal routes and fortunately got refugee status there narrate their stories with pride, those who have been deported or returned from half-way have tragic tales to tell.Nanda Kala Gharti, who lives in a small stone house on the upper flank of Tak village, spends her days in melancholy. Her husband, Dhanlal, had chosen to take the illegal route to the US, and Nanda Kala, a mother of four, is living with the repercussions of his decision. Dhanlal had got into the US after a six-month long arduous journey and was detained immediately. He had to spend four years in the detention camp, before he was deported to Nepal. He had already lost Rs6 million.Nanda Kala said they now have an insurmountable crisis in their hands. Pointing to her son, she exclaimed, “When will he grow up, go abroad and pay back the loans!”Dhanlal himself tried to go to Croatia once and spent 15 days in Kathmandu for the process. But after he was turned down, he returned home dejected. “Now we will submit the passport to another agent [for Dhanlal’s trip abroad],” Nanda Kala said. “There’s no point staying here.”Stories that echo each otherThe situation in Sisne Rural Municipality is similar to that of Putha Uttarganga. Here, one can hear plenty of stories of those who have tried to go to the US and those who are fighting refugee cases there. Krishna Regmi, chair of the rural municipality, personally knows seven people who have been deported from the US.Gangaram Khadka, a resident of Sisne-3, runs a bee and chicken farm. Like other young men in his village, Khadka had headed off to the US via an illegal route on 27 March, 2018. He had reached the US via the New Delhi-Moscow-Barcelona-Bogota-Panama-Costa Rica-Nicaragua-Honduras-Guatemala-Mexico route. When he finally arrived in the US, he was detained and had to spend 11 months in detention. He was deported on 15 March, 2019. He had handed over Rs3.2 millions to the agent and spent Rs2 million to fight the case to become a refugee. “It’s not possible for me to pay back the loan while working in Nepal,” he said. “I aim to pay back some interest and head off abroad again.”For six months after Khadka was deported, he had anxiety and headache, he said, adding the three people from his village who were deported like him are also struggling with their mental health.Tikaram Pun, a 40-year-old resident of Bohora village in Musikot-4, is also haunted by his past journey. In September 2017, he reached the US after crossing 17 countries with the help of organised human traffickers. Of the 41 people in his group, 31 were from Rukum East and Rukum West, he said. Pun, who was detained on arrival in the US, spent 24 months in a detention camp. His refugee application was also refused and so he was deported along with eight other Nepalis. “When I returned, I started having mental health problems. I still suffer from them,” he said. Pun is under pressure from creditors and relatives to pay back the Rs9.2 million loan he had taken for the task.Those who died on the wayA group of 10 Bangladeshis and seven Nepalis, including Rupak Bohora of Bafikot-3 in Rukum West, were on a mission to reach Costa Rica through Colombia, Caribbean Coast, Capuragana and Panama. But while they were crossing a sea, their boat capsized. As many as 12 died in the incident, including six Nepalis. Rupak’s wife, Geeta, learned about the incident only after six days, on 25 June, 2021.“I still don’t know what exactly happened,” said Geeta, who had been married off at age 19 and is now a mother of two daughters. The only thing she knows is that Rupak has died and she is now all alone. And that she has Rs5 million in loan taken for Rupak’s trip. She showed a picture of her husband on her phone to this scribe and said, “I only have memories.”Lack of political will and legal remediesThe concrete bridge over Chewang river is on the edge of Tak village. On the walls of the bridge are paintings of political theorists like Marx, Engels, Lenin, Stalin and Mao, and the iconic slogan, ‘Workers of the world, unite!’, below them. But the slogan appears to be at odds with life in the village. Given the phenomenon of illegal travels to the US through the help of organised human traffickers, the whole village appears to be emptying. Neither the local governments are concerned about the phenomenon nor are the political parties paying attention.Puniraj Gharti, chair of Putha Uttarganga Rural Municipality, said though the trend is worrying, there’s nothing he can do. “How could we stop them from making the trip when they are struggling to make a living in the village?” he said.Krishna Regmi, chair of Sisne Rural Municipality, said that the vicious cycle of poverty started after marijuana farming was banned in the country. Then the Maoist insurgency added to the woe, forcing youths to migrate. The signing of the peace agreement in 2006 didn’t herald any change in the economy either and youths are struggling to get jobs. Organised human traffickers are cashing in on this sorry state of affairs, Regmi said. “Meter byajis [usurious lenders] are also promoting this phenomenon,” he added.The phenomenon is equally rife in Dang’s Tulsipur and Ghorahi. Ramesh Kumar Pandey, chair of Ghorai-15, says that even though many heading to the US are swindled, no complaints are filed at the ward office. “Only those who attempt to go to Saudi Arabia or Qatar file the complaints,” he said.One can infer from Pandey’s statements that the families of such illegal travellers don’t want to publicise the ordeals of their family members. On the one hand, agents threaten them to not publicise the issue; on the other, they fear they themselves would be punished by law.According to the Anti-Human Trafficking Bureau, as many as 178 Nepalis, including 174 men, have been deported from the US in the five fiscal years after 2018-19. Of them, the highest 49 are from Rukum while 37 are from Dang. The data doesn’t include those who returned after making it to the half-way or those who have been fighting the legal battle in the US for refugee status. But this data is enough to show that many such youths are from the ‘base areas’ of the Maoist insurgency.SSP Jeevan Shrestha, chief of the bureau, said that data on the number of such victims and the amounts they have spent is hard to collect since complaints are rarely filed with the police. “This is human trafficking but for a lack of law, we are still compelled to launch the cases as per Human Trafficking and Transportation (Control) Act 2074 BS,” Shrestha said. “The Act provides a maximum penalty of Rs250,000 for the offenders and 50 percent of that as compensation to the victims.” Without specific law, police also invoke the theft and organised crime act to punish the offenders, he added.On the one hand, police receive no complaints; on the other, the phenomenon sees no control.Bhaskar Gautam, a political scientist, says the rise in cases of human trafficking in the insurgency’s ‘base areas’ is due to the political system’s abject failure.While the Maoists raised issues related to livelihood, nationalism and a new kind of democracy to fuel their war machine, after the peace process, it is livelihoods that have been hit the hardest, Gautam said. “The traditional way of life and economy took a hit during the insurgency,” he said. “Developments after the peace process also failed to address that. What sprang up was organised human trafficking.”(Mahesh KC in Rukum East and Durgalal KC in Dang contributed to this report.)This report is prepared in collaboration with the Center for Investigative Journalism-Nepal. \nGyanumaya BK had been suffering from severe backaches for a while. The resident of Pokhara-15, BK visited the Metrocity Hospital in Srijanachowk seeking treatment five months ago. The 69-year-old, who works as a labourer, has already spent over Rs50,000 on follow-up checkups and medications.BK spent eight days in the hospital in January and has been paying off loans she had taken to pay her bills and for follow-up visits to the hospital. Had BK been aware of the Health Facility Operation Standards-2020, which private hospitals must adhere to, she wouldn’t have had to borrow money to pay her medical bills. As per the regulations, hospitals must set aside 10 percent of their total beds to the underprivileged and needy.“I didn’t know hospitals were required to provide free treatment to those who can’t afford hospital stays,” BK said. “But even if I did, I would have to fight to get the service as the hospital won’t willingly offer me the service.”The Pokhara-based 50-bed hospital’s Chief Executive Officer Gyan Prasad Aryal admits that his hospital does not adhere to the mandate. “We don’t have explicit information from the health ministry on the Health Facility Operation Standards-2020,” said Aryal. “Moving forward, we will follow the instructions.” The hospital authorities say they give a 10-15 percent discount on the final hospital bill as opposed to dedicating 10 percent of their beds and free treatment and medications to the less privileged. Hospitals with 15 beds come under the jurisdiction of the local units while those with up to 50 beds fall under the ambit of the Provincial Health Directorate. Likewise, the Provincial Health Ministry oversees health facilities with over 50 beds.However, no regulatory body has data on whether health facilities are following government rules, especially Health Facility Operation Standards-2020. But it is an open secret that most private hospitals in Pokhara are not following the regulations.Pokhara Municipality Health Department Officer Yadunath Baral, Kaski District Health Officer Bhim Prasad Poudel, and Province Health Director Khim Bahadur Khadka all admit that local hospitals disregard the regulations. “Our monitoring and inspection is also lax, that’s why most hospitals ignore the rules,” he said. He says lack of manpower hampers effective inspection. “Our manpower is enough to conduct inspections in other districts, but not in Kaski, which has many private hospitals,” he said. “We need more people for that”. According to Baral, although the hospitals claim to offer a certain discount on final bills to the needy, they are unable to show the record of the discounts provided. “The hospitals claim they give discounts, but most hospitals have not even been able to show us the proof,” said Khadka. “Legal actions should be taken against the hospitals that fail to submit a monthly report on the free services for the poor. More importantly, they must be liable for flouting government standards that aim to benefit the poor.” The Provincial Health Directorate also does not have any data on the directive’s implementation at hospitals with more than 50 beds.The department’s chief of health services Dr Ramesh KC says that they have been working on updating information of health services in the Gandaki region. “Hospitals have failed to submit their mandatory monthly reports. We will seek that information when they come for new permits or permit renewal,” KC said. There are 27 privately-owned hospitals within the Pokhara Metropolitan City and 39 in the Gandaki region. Bharatpur Metropolitan City in Chitwan in Bagmati Province is also called the ‘medical city’  as it is home to 23 private hospitals with a total of 1,200 beds. Additionally, there are multiple large-scale government hospitals and two medical colleges—Chitwan Medical College and College of Medical Sciences—that also provide medical services. Had the Health Facility Operation Standards-2020 been followed by the 23 private hospitals, 120 patients would have received free health services every year, according to Durgadutta Chapagain, chief of the Chitwan Health Office.“Although the hospitals claim they provide the services, none have been able to provide convincing proof. Instead, we found them giving such discounts to patients who are close to hospital operators,” said Chapagain. “Our department validates the permits for new health facilities and re-registrations for hospitals with a 25-bed capacity. We have asked such public health service providers to put up posters or stickers reading ‘Discounts for the needy’ on the hospital premises so that patients know what services they can get on discount.”Meanwhile, Bikram Adhikari, Secretary of the Private Hospitals Coordination Committee in Chitwan, claims that the regulations are impractical. “There are a few services that hospitals can provide free of cost. You cannot expect hospitals to provide all services for free. That’s why there is a need to amend the existing regulations,” said Adhikari.The monitoring bodies’ inaction and lackadaisical approach to ensuring that public health services are accessible and affordable to all makes private hospitals blatantly ignore government mandates.Bharatpur Metropolitan City’s Deputy Mayor Chitrasen Adhikari says that although the metropolis is aware that private hospitals must allocate 10 percent of their beds for free treatment of poor people, the metropolis administration has yet to devise a monitoring mechanism. “We have not taken any steps towards that end, but we will soon,” he said.Just like Pokhara and Chitwan, Biratnagar is also plagued with the same problem. There are 32 private hospitals currently in operation in the metropolis. Deepak Bhattarai, statistical officer at the municipality’s health office, asserts that none of the health facilities met the set requirements. A monthly report submitted by the Biratnagar-based Nobel Medical College and Teaching Hospital, which has 750 beds, stated that the hospital had provided the said concession to more than 400 patients. “However, the report did not clarify how many of the 400 patients were provided free hospital beds and the services that come along with the beds, and how many were given discounts on their hospital bills,” Bhattarai said. “We found that hospital reports also include concessions provided to patients who sought outpatient, emergency, and X-ray services.”The hospital’s director Narayan Dahal claims to be following all government instructions. He says 10 percent hospital beds are set aside for needy patients who are not charged any treatment fees, while 10 percent of service seekers also get discounts.Although the Biratnagar Metropolis has directed all health facilities under its jurisdiction to allocate free beds and provide free services to the needy, inform service seekers about the government-provided services, and submit a list of all patients who have received the services, the directive is ignored more often than followed. According to Bhattarai, medical establishments must get a letter from the local unit before making any upgrades or purchasing any equipment. “But the hospitals have been found presenting fake documents in order to acquire such permits,” he said. “The metropolis has refused such permits to 12 private hospitals in the current fiscal year.”Butwal Sub-Metropolitan City in the Lumbini Province has also taken no concrete step to ensure private hospitals adhere to Health Facility Operation Standards-2020. Despite having the authority to carry out inspections, the sub-metropolis’ apathy has deprived hundreds of needy patients of various government services. The sub-metropolis with 17 wards has more than two dozen big hospitals in the Butwal bazaar area itself. Not one of them adheres to the government’s health regulations. But the sub-metropolis is yet to monitor these hospitals. Yubraj Pandey, chief of Butwal Sub Metropolitan’s health department, says they have been unable to inspect medical institutes due to a lack of a proper set of rules.“I have just been transferred here. Discussions are underway to prepare legal requirements,” he said. Private hospitals in Butwal only began filing their reports two months ago after a joint meeting, informs Chief of the Sub Metropolitan’s Education and Health Department Mitramani Khanal. Twenty-year-old Suraj BK of Sarawal Rural Municipality-2 in West Nawalparasi got into a motorcycle accident on April 26. He suffered injuries on both his legs and was taken to Zenus Hospital and Research Centre in Butwal. Suraj was handed a bill of Rs 70,000 for treatment but he did not have the money to clear the bill and sought the hospital’s help. “The hospital refused to provide any discount. They in fact refused to discharge me. I got my discharge papers only four days later after I paid almost Rs 100,000,” he said. “I had to get a loan to pay the hospital bills as my father, who is a farmer, did not have that kind of money.”Dr Sharda Singh, the hospital director, said Suraj did not qualify for a discount as he did not have a recommendation letter from the local unit. “Patients have to get a recommendation to avail of free services at private hospitals but Suraj could not bring one,” she said. “I was in the hospital bed for four days. I could not have secured a recommendation from the local unit in that state,” said Suraj. Ishwari Prasad Chapagain, a civil society leader of Rupandehi and a member of the Consumer Interest Protection Forum, says private hospitals in Butwal are more interested in making money than helping those in need. “They do not follow government mandates. They act as if they have to bear the expenses of providing free service to the poor when in fact they get tax rebates and such for such services,” he said. “The sub-metropolis also does not do the needful. Everyone is corrupt including the city officials.”  \nThe duel between Kathmandu’s 34-year-old mayor Balendra Shaha (popularly called Balen), a structural engineer, reputed rapper and political novice, and 72-year-old Khagda Prasad Sharma Oli, a high school dropout, two-time prime minister, political veteran and chairperson of the Communist Party of Nepal (United Marxist Leninist) is a caricature of contemporary Nepali politics marred by the conflict between the old and the young. The duel has attracted numerous newspaper articles, set social media on fire and provided YouTubers a field day. What is Oli’s motive in mobilising his whole party to attack Balen, and what is Balen—a lone man with no political experience and political following—doing picking a fight with Oli? How will the duel impact Oli’s party and Balen’s aspirations going forward? The fightThe Balen-Oli fight began when the metropolitan city started to clear buildings built illegally on municipal land or business advertisements that did not comply with municipal regulations. The city would order the current occupants of the offending buildings or business owners to comply with the law and vacate the premises. In most cases, the occupants would ignore the order. Like in old times, they relied on their political connections to continue to subvert the law. However, that did not work with Balen. He sent municipal forces to demolish the encroachment and non-compliant adverts. The first property subjected to the mayor's action belonged to someone connected to the UML. Soon after the clearance, a Central Committee member of the UML, Mahesh Basnet, called upon his minions to physically harm Balen if he did not “mend his ways”.Balen’s attempt to clean up Kathmandu from squatters occupying public land, particularly river banks, intensified the conflict. Oli publicly mocked Balen for using bulldozers to demolish plastic shades built by “poor squatters.” Some “squatters” are believed to occupy multistory buildings constructed on public land and own businesses worth millions of rupees. The majority of them are UML voters, “UMLs’ vote bank”, observed a Balen supporter. The squatter problem is not new. All previous governments, including the one led by Oli, recognised it. The conflict became increasingly acrimonious when Balen opened the basement of Dharahara for car parking. The government objected, arguing that the reconstruction of Dharahara is still incomplete and the car park is unsafe to use. Balen retorted, “Dharahara was inaugurated as a completed project by Prime Minister Oli before the last election. How can it be incomplete?” The inauguration of the work-in-progress was one of Prime Minister Oli’s pre-election charades. The car park is safe and currently in use; the reconstruction continues. The recent New Road imbroglio added fuel to the fire. Balen started widening the footpath on New Road to comply with the standards set by the Nepal Department of Roads (NDR). A local ward chair, a UML member, objected and complained to the Ministry of Physical Infrastructure and Transport headed by Deputy Prime Minister Ragubhir Mahaseth, an Oli acolyte. The NDR, which reports to Mahaseth, issued a “stop work” order. Incensed, Balen asked Oli to expeditiously arrange repayment for those who cheated the so-called Giri Bandhu Tea Estate land plotting scandal. Oli’s apparatchiks compared Balen to “a puppy” (a good-for-nothing weakling) and chastised him for maligning “our respected Chairman”. Oli himself has described Balen as a “bubble” which will fizzle out in no time. The fightersOli is old, witty, foxy, prickly, intolerant of criticism and, like all other politicians, corrupt in the public eye. As enunciated during his premiership, his vision of economic development includes building view towers, providing Kathmandu households with piped gas within six months, and building facilities for maritime trade—the latter two unachievable pipe dreams or political ploys. Balen is young, angry, ambitious, audacious, brash, bold, impulsive, focussed and untainted by corruption. His vision for Kathmandu is to make it a clean, functioning, beautiful heritage city. In about two years since he became mayor, Kathmandu has become relatively cleaner and greener. Its roads are rid of perpetual potholes; its sidewalks are walkable; teaching standards in public schools have improved; private schools who were short-changing on paying taxes have been forced to pay their share; emergency ambulance service has become more dependable, and so on. All of the above, despite a lack of support from political parties and the government. Parties do not support him because his success will spotlight their past failures. Despite the odds, his accomplishments have made him hugely popular throughout the country. “If we have ten leaders like Balen, we can change the country,” an exuberant Kathmandu taxi driver told me. Even the international press has taken note of Balen’s leadership. The New York Times published a story on Balen last year. He was named one of the 100 upcoming leaders in 2023 by the internationally known Time Magazine, published in the US. Balen’s public support is so visceral that he gets away even with outrageous comments like “burning Singha Durbar’, Nepal’s central secretariat, the office of Nepal’s Ministries, and irrelevant dragging of Oli into the “Giri Bandhu Tea Estate” scandal, and other similar outbursts. Although the overwhelming support for such comments on social media is surprising, it is indicative of the intensity of public dislike of established politicians.The future Balen knows that he owes his popularity as much to his performance as his refusal to bow down to political pressure and to stay clean from corruption scandals. In the two years since he assumed office, he has given confidence to the city dwellers that with exemplary leadership, the city and the country can be changed. His future depends on whether he can continue to ignore political pressure and demonstrate his perseverance, will, guts and vision to turn chaotic Kathmandu into a livable metropolis. As for Oli, UML lost the last election in Kathmandu because its mayor, a UML member, was a dismal failure. The confrontation with Balen for political upmanship and ego inflation will unlikely win Kathmandu for him. Cooperation may work better than confrontation.    \nOverhead bridges often become hangout spaces where people spend time observing the hustle and bustle of the city. Even in the small and noisy traffic island of Koteshwor junction, one can observe people resting and killing time. Similarly, plenty of people visit the open land of Koteshwor-Tinkune to play sports, and many more are there as spectators.These examples indicate the growing demand and potential for public spaces in Kathmandu.Having public spaces in urban areas has multiple benefits. Open spaces improve public health by providing space for physical activity and refreshment. They make places socially and economically vibrant by attracting people and activities. They serve as emergency shelters during disasters like earthquakes. If planned well, open spaces help in biodiversity conservation and groundwater recharge. However, the situation of open spaces in Kathmandu Valley is miserable. UN-Habitat recommends 15-20 percent of urban land for open public spaces. However, according to a report published by the Kathmandu Valley Development Authority, only 2.29 percent of the land was available as open space in 2012, and the condition has not improved. The irregular distribution of public spaces has also reinforced their unavailability. Advocates for urban public spaces recommend the availability of open spaces within walking distance, a 400-metre radius. However, many places in our cities do not have public spaces nearby, and even when they are available, they are usually gated and inaccessible.Public parks are confined within high boundary walls and gates. Shielding public spaces from the public is a paradox, although it is supported by common reasonings such as possible vandalism, waste littering and maintenance difficulty. As a result, we are undermining the value of public spaces.Similarly, unifunctional and exclusive planning approaches have also compromised the effectiveness of public spaces. Public parks designed for specific demographics, such as elderly people’s and children’s parks, have become a new trend. When this is not the case, the spaces still lack provisions for a diverse population: Women, children, differently abled and so on.Furthermore, ecological dimensions are rarely considered during the development of public spaces. Local hydrology, geology, biodiversity, and natural ecosystems are disregarded. Approaches like the plantation of non-native vegetation for mere beautification, a large proportion of hardscape, and the absence of stormwater management systems show a superficial approach to public space management.In addition to these issues, open spaces constantly threaten encroachment. Sometimes, encroachments seem like an act of conservation but end up with the controlled ownership of some individuals or groups. The Nepal Army’s occupation of part of Tundikhel is one such example. At other times, public spaces are intruded by building construction and infrastructural development. Despite all such challenges, urban public spaces can be enhanced in many ways.First and foremost, existing and potential open spaces should be identified; larger parks, khya (culturally significant open lands), urban pockets, riverfronts, traditional ponds, courtyards and other potential spaces should be mapped out and planned for. Encroached public lands should be reclaimed. As for new urban areas, the government should provide open spaces beforehand.After that, identified public spaces should be managed, with due consideration of their typology and context. Larger parks can be developed with a significant proportion of native greenery and diverse spaces such as sports areas, recreational areas, water bodies, and gardens. Basic services like public toilets and drinking water services should be arranged.Smaller spaces can be designed as urban green pockets. Machhindra Park near Jawalakhel is one good example. Cultural-communal lands such as Khya should be managed with minimal interventions.Riverside landscape can also be capitalised as urban public spaces. Some riverside parks, such as Sankhamul Park, have already demonstrated the use value of riverfronts. However, the custom of retaining wall boundaries and ornamental landscape disassociates the river’s relationship with the land and people. Therefore, riverside development that promotes biodiversity and ecological sustainability and strengthens people’s physical and spiritual relationship with water is essential.Next, we can capitalise on traditional open spaces like ponds and courtyards. For instance, ponds can be revitalised with proper pavements, seating spaces, and safety. Pim Bahal Pukhu at Patan and Nigu Pukhu at Thimi are perfect examples of traditional pond-based revitalisation that boosted the place’s socio-economic activities.Furthermore, creative strategies are required to transform unconventional spaces such as overhead bridges, sidewalks, bus stops, and traffic islands into appealing public spaces. For instance, a pedestrian bridge, beyond its functional use of crossing roads, can act as a lively space if upgraded with public space amenities. Greenery addition, shed, carved-out spaces for interaction, seating spaces, and artworks are a few strategies. Likewise, wide sidewalks can be transformed into green infrastructure networks constituting rest spaces, kiosks and drinking water fountains.Lastly, the most important step in public space management is to embrace the ‘Make it Simple’ design approach. This will significantly help tackle the issues of maintenance challenges, budgetary limitations and environmental degradation. Barrier concepts should be replaced with design and management solutions to resolve public space maintenance issues. Too many interventions and high-maintenance elements such as fountains, extravagant lighting and furniture can be intentionally avoided. Simple open ground composed of local vegetation, seating platforms, and minimal hardscape with durable materials like stones can also make beautiful parks. Providing open spaces is not enough in itself, though. For example, the Dharahara complex, although designed as a landmark public space, isolates itself from the surrounding context. Ultimately, public spaces should be physically well interconnected with existing urban networks to make them more accessible, practical, and contextual. \nNepali art exhibitions held in May-June 2024 at Kathmandu’s major galleries represent the diversity of the idioms of Nepali paintings executed in traditional, ethnic and modern forms. Visiting the exhibitions, closely observing the artworks, and interacting with the curators and some artists, I realised that the quest for the right idioms to express the major motifs of paintings continues to be the main thrust of the artists. In this article, I am alluding to the genre of paintings exhibited in galleries. I have attempted to review the paintings displayed at the exhibitions and briefly discuss the diverse modalities and practices of exhibitions, as well as the impact of audience-oriented activism. Though I have been writing on the diverse genres and forms of Nepali art like sculpture, architecture and installation-oriented works mainly curated in Nepal by Sangeeta Thapa through major events under such rubrics as “biennale and triennale”, I have mostly produced reviews of paintings over the decades. I have put my review writings in catalogues and journals. In recent years, I have been writing articles on art for the academic journal Sirjana of the Sirjana College of Fine Arts. Navindra Man Rajbhandari, an artist, art teacher, curator, and pedagogue, has been working earnestly to edit and publish this journal. I visited the painting exhibitions in the major galleries—two at the Nepal Art Council, Babarmahal and one each at the Nepal Academy of Fine Arts and the Siddhartha Art Gallery. Interestingly, all these exhibitions are audience-oriented. The painting exhibition practice often follows the rituals of cataloguing the works with simple introductions and price tags written somewhat half-heartedly. They also mention the mediums used by the painters, like oil, water, gouache and, very commonly, acrylic. From the early artists who were exposed to Western art to those of contemporary times in Nepal, all use the same mediums as artists anywhere in the world. These mediums are the universal shapers of the idioms of paintings. Nepali painters use the above-mentioned mediums and other admixtures according to their modern training and indigenous painting traditions. The evolution of colour paintings, especially oil, marks the presence of the audience or the clientele of paintings; it has become a commonly recognised subject. All came through modern education in art. Artists’ emotions and the consonance of cultural and aesthetic factors are commonly represented in such paintings.One eloquent example was seen at an art exhibition, “Deities of Nepal II”, held at the Nepal Art Council in May-June 2024. This exhibition, principally curated by the art academic Swosti Rajbhandari Kayastha, presented some remarkable paintings and their projection modalities. The diversity of the paintings executed according to the overt and covert themes of sacrality had one common element. Their choice of colours and hues and their delineation to create the exquisite beauty of the mythopoetic figural of the characters in the paintings was one eloquent feature. Modern painters also treated the divine figures and their aura in their non-figural works. I especially liked the modern techniques in these paintings about the deities. The thrust was experimental. Some artists, comparatively, made very good paintings; others were just cliché works, naturally. However, the common strength and feature of all the paintings that featured the iconography was what the brief brochure text says: The composition of “the deities intricately woven into a tapestry of philosophical and spiritual beliefs.” The other was the search for an appropriate style for projecting the spiritual motifs. The paintings appeared to establish a covenant with the audience, this time through a pricing pattern. Paintings were liberally priced; some were priced up to Rs4 million. And the remarkable matter was that some of these expensive paintings were “sold” to Nepali buyers. We should remember that the paintings were sold as works of art, not as pictures of religious iconographies. The entry of the modern audience into Nepali paintings is what matters here. John Berger, a great art critic, says that the painting itself should generate the buyer’s desirability through its touchable and visual attraction. I saw this covenant at this exhibition. The next display was the “National Exhibition of Fine Arts 2024”. This one presents a different perspective in my collection several decades’ glossy catalogues of the Nepal Academy of Fine Arts. This exhibition, curated by Devendra Kumar Kafle, aka Thumkeli, its member secretary, and other departmental academy members, presents a unique view of Nepali art. Kafle guided me through the variety of artworks and described the collection methods. The collection is based on the modality of sampling artworks of Indigenous and regional features and bringing them out to the national exhibition, which is a remarkable activity. The Academy has published small glossy catalogues for them. In his note, the Chancellor of the Academy, Naradmani Hartumchali, says this is a culmination of such exhibitions in all seven states. He stresses the need to bring art to a level where indigenous forms could be made a topic of political significance by evoking such features as representation and social transformation. I don't know of any well-researched discussions on this important topic initiated by any authentic institutions. But the exhibition speaks for itself. The current exhibition, “Threads of Simultaneity”, organised by ‘Sirjana 2024’ and mainly curated by Navindra Man Rajbhandari, exhibits 200 pieces of artwork executed by 28 artists at the Arts Council. Artist Rajbhandari revealed that the exhibition was an attempt to project a historicity of a combined nature of art activity shared entirely by the academic cohort of the institution. The exhibition features some works of the erstwhile principals Sashi Shah (2001-11), Krishna Manandhar (2011-17) and Madan Chitrakar (2018-22), and members of the Sirjana College of Arts like Vatsa Gopal Vaidya and other senior artists associated with the college one way or the other. Works of the young and senior artists are on display. I also want to recall yet another unique exhibition organised by Siddhartha Art Gallery, “Sawari Kathaharu: Art in Motion”, in May 2024. The concept of motion in art is presented by creating the art of motion, as in Ralph Lily Turner’s “Storms”, Hokusai’s “Great Waves”, Pablo Picasso’s “Guernica” and Sashi Shah’s “Darting Horses”, to take a few examples. Capturing the fixed images mounted on darting objects like vehicles and exhibiting them in a reputed gallery is designed to showcase experimental works and their appeal.May and June 2024 were eventful in the realm of Nepali art. I was struck by the variety of motifs and styles that show the performative mode of Nepali paintings. \nIn yet another instance of the Nepali society failing to provide a safe space to women, a 16-year girl was raped in Panchadewal Binayak Municipality in Achham on Monday. The victim was staying in a chhau goth, or menstrual shed, at her maternal uncle’s home when she was violated by her distant relative. After years of awareness campaigns and the breaking of chhau sheds by central and local governments as well as non-governmental agencies, the victimisation of women remains a daily occurrence in several parts of Nepal, especially Karnali and Sudurpaschim provinces. The chhaupadi system was outlawed by the Supreme Court in 2005; in 2017, it was made punishable by up to three months in jail or a fine of Rs3,000 or both. But the inhumane practice remains deeply rooted in parts of Nepali society. While reports of extreme cases come from the hinterlands, menstrual taboo rules the roost even in the sophisticated drawing rooms and kitchens of urban centres. Impurity runs in the psyche of the average Nepali; menstrual blood simply oils the juggernaut of superstition, patriarchy and misogyny that is Nepali society.As disturbing as the news of the rape is the report that the victim’s relatives tried to conceal the incident. After all, this is a society whose so-called honour lies in the private parts of a woman. If it cannot save the woman from predators, it must hide the fact that it could not save the woman. From celebrating and defending rape-accused celebrities to punishing victims for speaking up, this society fails women each day. Just consider how unsafe this place is for women who have to suffer the indignity of chhau in this day and age. Cold, rain, wild animals, serpents or asphyxiation do not even come close to the danger they face from men. The tragic irony is that the woman who becomes “impure” or “untouchable” inside the home remains an object of desire inside the chhau shed. Consider how many cases of sexual assaults might have been brushed under the carpet in the name of family honour. Every night a woman has to spend in a chhau shed should count as the death of the conscience of Nepali society.Gauri Kumari Bayak and Amba Bohara and her two children were killed in 2018; Parbati Bogati and Parbati Budha were killed in 2019 in menstrual huts; and the list goes on, the tragedies returning each year. How many women must be raped and murdered before the society goes beyond the “shame” and “honour” dichotomy and considers women equal humans? How many seminars, constitutions and movements does it take for the state to be able to create a safe space for women? The society and the state must answer. Until it can guarantee safety and dignity to the women, the Nepali state might want to keep the national flag half-mast. After all, one-half of the flag belongs to the women, who make up half of the country's population.  \nThe Nepali cricket team is returning home today after a bittersweet performance at the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup 2024 in the US and the West Indies. But at the same time, it has sent an unmistakable message to the world: “We have arrived!”Nepal technically did not win any of the group stage matches at the world cup. The only point it got was through a draw with Sri Lanka after rain forced the match to be abandoned. The match with Sri Lanka was certainly the most anticipated considering how they were a relatively weaker team in the group and Nepal had a great chance of getting both the points. But Nepal was not out there looking for the weakest. Rather, it was there to take on the strongest cricketing giants. In the other three matches—against the Netherlands, South Africa and Bangladesh—Nepal gave its opponents ample evidence of its arrival on the global cricketing scene. The most electric performance, of course, was against South Africa when Nepal lost by just a run. But even in the narrow loss, it won plenty of hearts and accolades, having forced a top Test cricket-playing nation ranked third in one-day internationals and fifth in T20 internationals to run for its money. Neither could the Netherlands and Bangladesh take Nepal for granted. What was equally gratifying was the forceful presence of Nepali cricket fans cheering for Team Nepal. The Nepali fans did not only fill the stadiums from Texas to Florida to St. Vincent, they cheered on even as their team lost. This was not just due to a strengthening spirit of sportsmanship but also the confidence that we are rising and rising as a cricketing nation. At home, though, there is still a lot of work to do. The men in blue and red might want to work on their batting skills, for that is where we flattered the most this time. After assessing their World Cup odyssey, captain Rohit Paudel and coach Monty Desai will certainly sit down to work out a new plan of action, and we must have faith in their leadership—after all, Nepali cricket hasn’t been as consistently strong as it is under them. What we need immediately is investment in infrastructure. We do not even have a single stadium with floodlights, let alone proper stands and toilets for the spectators. The stadium in Kirtipur is rustic and amateurish at best; the one in Mulpani is taking ages to complete although it has been used for some tournaments; and the one in Bharatpur that has been partially built by the Dhurmus-Suntali Foundation has a long way to go before it comes into operation. Moreover, our players have limited exposure to even regional cricket although we live at the nervecentre of the cricketing world—South Asia. Nepal must take the initiative to invite regional cricketing powerhouses such as Afghanistan, Bangladesh, India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka for friendly and competitive matches so that our players get greater exposure. We have seen how Afghanistan has risen as the dark horse of cricket in just a few years with the right kind of regional support, mainly India. We stand to be the next big story in the cricketing world if we play our shots right.  \nWhile countries worldwide are forging ahead on an electric future, Nepal is still struggling to set clear plans and policies in the field. The government’s 10 percent tax hike on electric vehicles (EVs) for the fiscal year 2024-25 comes as a tight slap to the country’s commitment to EV-based mobility by 2030—at a time green transport systems across the country feel ever more important. For this or that reason, consumers here are obliged to line up for a whole day, if not days, to fill up their motor tanks. In a recent case, the underpaid fuel station workers halted fuel supply to private dealers and thronged the state-run stations in Kathmandu. These occurrences are here to stay, reminding us of the need to take the EV transition seriously. It is widely known that promoting EVs offers multiple benefits. The transition to electric vehicles in Nepal will not only reduce vehicular emissions and clean the air but also discourage the country’s overreliance on fossil fuels, which account for more than 17 percent of the total import bill. This shift, in turn, can help us leverage our under-tapped hydropower potential to build charging stations and export electricity to the two closest neighbours transitioning to green policies. EVs are costly to install, and concerns about insufficient charging stations in Nepal remain, but they are still more efficient and cost-effective than petrol or diesel vehicles. Nepal will also benefit from increased climate funds in the long run if we successfully make air breathable by cutting vehicular emissions through EV adoption. After all, Nepal must have a moral ground and track record of actions to negotiate for these funds and can’t always fall back on the excuse of the country’s negligible contribution to greenhouse gas emissions. What policymakers seem to be overlooking is the urgency of EV adoption. Their plans and policies on electric vehicles are ambiguous as, on the one hand, they pledge a green energy future while, on the other, they agree on building oil pipeline projects with India. Moreover, they always set ambitious goals and fail to achieve them. For instance, by introducing the Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC) in 2016, the government aimed to increase the share of EVs to 20 percent of all passenger vehicles; however, by 2020, only 1 percent were electric. Now, when people are more interested in buying these green wheels due to the tax cut on EVs last year, the new tax increment is bound to affect their choices. These developments are setbacks to meeting net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2045 and decarbonising the transport sector by 2030.It’s high time to come up with clear policies on green growth and execute interventions that wholeheartedly support electric vehicles. This includes installing charging stations and finding ways to sustain them by emulating international practices on repurposing, recycling and managing used batteries. Many organisations, donor agencies and development partners are extending their hand to Nepal in this effort. Failing to establish clear strategies and imposing tax restrictions could mean missing out on the benefits these agencies can provide and the overall change electric vehicles can bring to Nepal. The green energy goal is worth pursuing collectively, as no less than the future of humanity depends on it. Nepal as a responsible global actor must do its bit.  \nThe government’s recent decision to recall ambassadors, particularly Nepal’s envoy to India, just ahead of Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal’s visit to New Delhi, courted widespread controversy. What are the takeaways of the prime minister’s Delhi visit? What is the progress in implementing the trade and transit agreement signed with China and with the BRI projects? Thira Lal Bhusal of the Post sat down with Rupak Sapkota, foreign affairs advisor to the prime minister, for some insights.The government’s decision to recall ambassadors from 11 countries at once has come under heavy criticism. Why did the government take such a decision?In general, it has become a practice of sorts to recall incumbent ambassadors and appoint new ones after changes in the government or in the ruling coalition. This has both merits and demerits. The country’s foreign policy doesn’t change with a change in government. But every government and coalition has its specific policies, programmes and priorities. Therefore, even other countries make changes in political appointments as per the government’s priorities. Our case is a bit different. Ruling coalitions are frequently changed, and so are ambassadors. As there is a high chance of our politics being governed by coalitions given our electoral system, it has become necessary to establish a rational system on ambassadorial appointment. Either the political appointees themselves should voluntarily quit the job and return home just like vice-chair and members of the National Planning Commission do. Or there should be a consensus among major political forces to allow our ambassadors to serve out the full term.The second option of allowing ambassadors to serve out their term sounds better, doesn’t it?Definitely. Some initiatives have been taken with the objective of making our diplomatic appointments more prestigious, merit-based and better-managed. The government in 2019 introduced some criteria on ambassadorial appointments. We have to put more effort into ensuring that our ambassadorial appointees have the capacity to effectively carry out diplomatic duties. Once we establish a system of appointing envoys based on merit and not out of political biases, we can create a situation of allowing them to serve for the full term. Then, a change of coalition wouldn’t affect their continuity. We need to develop such a political consensus, given our geopolitical sensitivity.But the ambassadors appointed in recent years and their activities in host countries have lowered the bar of our diplomacy.We have seen rapid and huge changes in power equations in the world. In view of that, we can see some countries have appointed former ministers and even prime ministers as envoys to the countries with whom they have vital relations. They also appoint such personalities as envoys for a special mission. So, we have to think about ambassadorial appointments from different perspectives based on the changed context. It is high time that all the political forces and leaders agree on a basic point that those who have in-depth understanding and expertise of the field and can work for the best interest of the country will be appointed the country’s ambassadors. If the individual is competent, the person’s affiliation to a political party may not be a problem. But whether the person can work in the best interest of the country must be considered before appointment.But the government itself doesn’t seem serious about maintaining diplomatic decorum. For instance, the June 6 Cabinet meeting decided to recall the ambassador from India just days ahead of the prime minister’s New Delhi visit. There were also reports that the prime minister made the decision reluctantly due to pressure from coalition partners. What is the real story?It is nothing more than a coincidence. There were discussions about making changes in the ambassadorial positions in line with the March 4 changes in the ruling coalition. But it was deferred as the government needed to accomplish some important tasks and convene events such as the investment summit. When the government decided to change our ambassadors, it just happened to coincide with the prime minister’s visit to New Delhi to attend the swearing-in ceremony of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. It was a coincidence. Despite the decision, the ambassador had sufficient time to properly conclude all his engagements and duties there. The way he facilitated the process during the prime minister’s visit doesn’t reflect any misgivings about the government’s decision. So, it should be taken as a course that is in keeping with our tradition. In recent decades, other countries have given top priority to economic diplomacy, but the selection of our envoys and their activities doesn’t reflect that. Why aren’t we thinking in that direction?Yes, diplomacy in the past used to be one-dimensional, or it was conducted mainly by one particular ministry—the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. These days, many other ministries are engaged with international agencies. Economic diplomacy, labour diplomacy, climate diplomacy and security affairs have become crucial. We have to increase coordination, cooperation and collaboration among relevant agencies to make our international relations more fruitful and in line with the policies and goals set by our government.We have seen profound changes in terms of approaches, perspectives and dynamics of diplomacy in recent decades. All countries have started to give more importance to the competence of diplomats also in view of the increased geopolitical competition and rivalry seen between world powers. Rapid innovation in science and technology has not only eased our lives but also added challenges. We have to handle so many diplomatic engagements. Similarly, the number of international forums where we have to engage are increasing. These days, multilateral diplomacy and engagements have become as important. Even minilateral forums have started to play vital roles in international relations as the world powers have adopted multiple strategies to create their spheres of influence. In the meantime, the role of public diplomacy has become influential. So, a diplomat today must be dynamic and efficient enough to grasp the international situation, understand the sensitivity of the host country, articulate our country’s views efficiently and work in national interest. Therefore, it has become vital to be extra careful while selecting ambassadors.You talked about better coordination but we don’t see any correction in the practice of bypassing the foreign ministry while working with international agencies.Definitely, the foreign ministry is our focal point for all international relations conducted by a ministry or agency of our country. There should be no dispute about that. We need to make the foreign ministry more resourceful. Then, the ministry will have more capacity and efficiency to handle issues related to security, finance, labour and climate.Why have we failed to maintain reciprocity in terms of diplomats’ relations with the leaders of host countries? For example, our ambassadors in some capitals don’t get to meet the host leaders for years while the foreign envoys in Kathmandu can meet our prime minister and foreign minister directly and instantly.We have to see it from two perspectives. One is the power structure. In international relations, we can see the reflection of the asymmetric power relations between the big powers and other countries. The more developed and resourceful country’s influence in a host country can be seen and felt. Second, despite being an envoy from an underdeveloped or a small country, one can have diplomatic relations based on the principle of sovereign equality. It depends on the individual diplomat as well.In Kathmandu, we often err when dealing with foreign envoys. We have to decide what level of importance to give them. Therefore, some initiatives have been taken to correct and maintain consistency by implementing a diplomatic code of conduct that aims to integrate all activities through the foreign ministry. Foreign envoys will follow the system if we implement it consistently, irrespective of changes in the government. For that, there should be a political understanding at the national level.Let’s move to Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal’s recent India visit. Though it was mainly to attend the swearing-in ceremony of Indian Prime Minister Modi, he held some important political meetings. What are the takeaways from the visit?The visit was important from bilateral, regional and international perspectives. Traditionally, foreign affairs was described as an extended form of domestic affairs. But these days, international affairs have influence over domestic affairs as well. So such meetings and dialogues at the prime minister’s level are important. They exchanged views in a very cordial atmosphere. Of late, we have maintained bilateral dialogues at the political level on a regular basis and that has helped remove misunderstandings. Our prime minister’s emphasis is to hold bilateral dialogues both at the political as well as diplomatic levels in order to settle differences. India has taken this spirit positively.Second, the two prime ministers discussed how to expedite the implementation of the agreements reached between Nepal and India during Prime Minister Dahal’s official visit a year ago. The issue was discussed during the meeting between Prime Minister Dahal and Indian External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar as well. They also expressed satisfaction over progress in the implementation of bilateral agreements mainly in energy trade, connectivity and investment. In recent years, we have seen progress in investment, economic and trade sectors. Yet we still have some differences on border issues. That is an important and positive development in Nepal-India relations in recent years. In the past, when we had some differences on political, border or other issues, that used to badly affect other aspects of our relations. But now, both the countries agree to resolve outstanding issues through dialogue and our trade and all other affairs are moving ahead smoothly. This is the encouraging part of our relations. But border disputes can sour our relations anytime, right? Is there a sense of urgency to resolve it once and for all?The prime minister is for activating the concerned bilateral mechanisms to resolve such issues. He has also invited Indian Prime Minister Modi to visit Nepal. We can expect the Indian prime minister’s Nepal visit in near future. We can make some progress in resolving some outstanding matters such as border issues during the high level visit. I believe we will move ahead in this direction.Any progress on submitting the report of the Eminent Persons’ Group?During the meetings, the prime minister raised overall bilateral issues that include the matter related to the EPG report. I think once the mechanisms are activated and start working, that will create a situation for the report’s submission.Nepal and Bangladesh are completing homework for greater energy trade. India’s facilitation is a must for that. Is there any progress on securing the southern neighbour’s support for that?Progress in energy cooperation is a major achievement of this tenure of the prime minister. The progress is not limited to the bilateral level but goes to the regional level. A Cabinet committee of the Bangladesh government earlier this month approved a proposal to import 40 megawatts of electricity from Nepal. At present, we will use India’s infrastructure to export energy to Bangladesh. But for the long term there is a plan to build a dedicated transmission line for that. This shows it is not only Nepal that is interested in exporting its energy but other countries in this region are also interested in importing Nepal’s electricity. We have also signed an agreement to build a cross border transmission line with China. The doors are being opened for regional trade of our energy. This development will make India more open to importing energy from Nepal.Why are we failing to expedite projects under the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) of China?The economic cooperation between Nepal and China has substantially increased after we joined the BRI framework. So, Nepal has been benefitting from the BRI. We see some concern about the lack of progress on certain infrastructure projects to be built under the BRI framework. In fact, we are in a better position to implement the projects because now we can decide what kind of BRI projects are good for us based on the experience of project development and implementation under the BRI in other countries.We are working to finalise the BRI implementation agreement. Nepal wants to move ahead by signing the implementation agreement and developing the projects. Nepal joined the BRI framework based on its need to diversify trade and connect to the world market. The reality is the same now. So, we need to sign the implementation plan and move ahead as soon as possible. When I attended the Boao Forum a few months ago, I found the Chinese authorities and other stakeholders holding debates to build quality and resilient infrastructure. They also have plans to support the capacity enhancement of human resources and transfer technology in the BRI member countries.People mainly link the BRI with big infrastructure projects such as railway, road and transmission connectivity but there is no significant progress on these fronts. What are the roadblocks?In Nepal, no big infrastructure project has been completed on time, be it the Melamchi drinking project, airports, hydropower or road projects. We haven’t developed the capacity to build big projects, and we don’t envision any plan to operate after building it. So, not only with China but also with other countries and agencies, we have to seek support for small and medium-size projects that we can efficiently build and operate. Also, the third version of the BRI action plan has included building not only big but small and smart projects under the framework. We have to push for that. As we build our capacity, we can gradually take up big projects. For instance, now we can build big hydro projects on our own. It wasn’t the case until some years ago. We developed expertise in hydropower by building many small projects in the past few decades and gradually enhanced our capacity. We have already faced problems in operating the Pokhara and Bhairahawa airports. Is there any progress in taking Chinese support to operate the airports?We have to see both aspects—domestic as well as international use—of the airports. The two airports have helped us upgrade the quality of our domestic air travel as the passengers have benefited due to the upgraded infrastructure. The number of domestic passengers in these airports has increased significantly.It is true that there is no progress in terms of operating them as international airports. The government is studying all possibilities of their use based on their unique features. We are exploring various options in international markets to attract adventure tourists to Pokhara. Chinese stakeholders are also holding some promotional activities in Pokhara. Chinese authorities have told us that they are consulting with their provincial bodies and exploring possibilities to run regular flights to Pokhara. Similarly, the government is mobilising our embassies and other stakeholders in certain countries having a large number of Buddhist tourists to operate flights to Bhairahawa, and we have received some positive responses. I believe we will be able to operate regular international flights from these two airports soon.It’s been eight years since we signed the trade and transit agreement with China, which was touted as a historic deal between the two countries. Why haven’t we been able to implement it?Some symbolic steps have been taken in this period. For instance, a shipment was received from a third country [Vietnam] using a Chinese port in September last year. Similar other initiatives have been taken but these are limited to symbolic gestures. We have to prepare infrastructure and some legal basis to implement the agreements in a more result-oriented way. A bilateral meeting is being held this week. The meeting is likely to discuss how to bring the trade and transit protocol in an effective way. This meeting will discuss various issues faced so far and will also pave the way forward. We have also proposed to form a ministerial-level mechanism to oversee overall bilateral issues. The upcoming meeting will sort out various issues.The Chinese side was conducting a feasibility study of the Keirung-Kathmandu cross-border railway project. What is the progress?There is progress in various projects that we are carrying out with Chinese support. The cross-border railway feasibility study is in the final stage. Likewise, the study on the Chhahare-Tokha tunnel project is ongoing. A Chinese team is arriving to conduct a feasibility study of the Hilsa-Simkot road. A process to award a contract to build a friendly bridge at Hilsa with Chinese grants has begun. A foundation stone will be laid there soon. Also, a study to build the Chilime-Rashuwagadhi-Keirung 220kV cross-border transmission line is beginning soon. \nThe government has decided to make the National ID Card mandatory in order to receive services from government and public institutions. In the first phase, the June 6 Cabinet meeting made the National ID card number mandatory in 28 districts. People including federal lawmakers criticised the decision saying that it was enforced without first distributing the cards. In this context, Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal sat down with Yubaraj Katel, director general of the Department of National ID and Civil Registration.Let’s begin with a basic question. Why do we need a National ID card while we already have citizenship certificate, driving license, passport and voting card?There is a fundamental difference between a citizenship card and National ID. Citizenship establishes whether you are a citizen of the country and it helps you identify yourself with some basic details. In Nepal, it was also widely used as a service card. Wherever you go, you have to show the citizenship card—to open a bank account or acquire a SIM card for a phone. If we study international practices, there are mainly two cards—one is an identity card and the other is a service card. In 2018, the Nepal government came up with the idea of distributing national identity cards with a unique digital number for each eligible citizen. The number can track not only the individual but also the person’s activities and movements. This project has various components. First is data collection. It has two categories—demographic data, such as the names of father, mother and other family members. Second is biometric data—fingerprints, eye retina and digital signature. The biometric data is crucial to create a unique identity of each individual and avoid duplication in the integrated national database. The National ID has these two types of data. The other tasks are enrollment of the data, printing and distribution of the cards and then providing services based on that. At present, people carry multiple cards in their pockets. The objective of this project is to replace all of them by a single card–National ID. The new card includes vital details of all other cards in its chip with 1GB storage capacity. The government wanted to trace people based on their unique individual numbers so that there is no need to print and carry multiple cards. There is a huge industry of printing separate cards for each and every service that is creating a jumble of information. The National ID will not only replace multiple cards but also help authorities control criminal activities like financial frauds by removing duplication. At present, government authorities have difficulty in tracing and identifying an individual and wrongdoers are benefitting from that situation.What cards will be replaced by the National ID?It has a chip with 1GB storage capacity where you can store your driving license, academic documents, voting card, insurance details, ATM card number, etc. For instance, if you go to a telecom company to acquire a SIM card, they will ask for a copy of your citizenship card. You can say, ‘no, I have a National ID card’. Once you give your number and fingerprint, they can immediately verify it through the system. Another objective is to help people get rid of filling up pages of forms for each service. International governance has a norm that says don’t ask citizens their information more than once. A state agency should seek the information once and provide it to other state agencies if they require it. People complain that many agencies don’t accept National ID. They still ask for a citizenship card for official record and verification. So, in practice, it didn’t help people reduce the number of cards in their pockets. In fact, it added one more.Therefore, the June 6 Cabinet decision made the use of National ID cards compulsory in 28 districts. Now, it is going to be essential to get social security allowances, pensions and claim health insurance. The Health Insurance Board has said it has become challenging for them to verify whether a claimant is the rightful one. The board has 8 million policyholders. We will give them our details. Then, they can cross-check the authenticity of a claimant. This will help avoid huge financial frauds. In fact, the government should have made it mandatory earlier.But people including lawmakers in the federal parliament have strongly opposed the decision saying that the government made National ID mandatory without first distributing the cards to the people.Nepal’s total population is over 30 million. Our principal stakeholders are citizenship card holders. Those 16-year-olds are eligible for citizenship cards. The Election Commission distributes voting cards to those above 18 years. We got the data from the commission and added 20 percent and estimated that we have 18.6 people above 16 years old. As of Friday, we have already distributed the National ID numbers to 14.9 million people. Now, as per our estimate, around 3.7 million people are yet to get the National ID. Millions of people are abroad. Thus, we are headed towards saturation point in terms of data collection and issuance of the numbers. One thing I want to stress is that people don’t need a hard copy of the National ID card. The number is sufficient. Printing cards is costly. We have to pay around 2 euro to procure a blank card. The cost of printing, delivery and other overhead expenses is added to that. With the task of printing over a billion copies of ID cards being too costly, even India discourages use of hard copy of the cards. You can create the QR code of your card, save it in your mobile or print it in a paper and scan it wherever you need it.Officials at our government agencies bring up the rule that makes it mandatory to present a physical copy of citizenship card or other documents for official works.Yes, we are trained and habituated in that way. Now we need to change. We must make offices paperless while developing a strong database system. We have been using citizenship cards to verify the identity of a person for a long time. Biometrics not only helps identify people but also trace their activities. Recently, Rs2 billion was found in the bank accounts of a 26-year-old man. The money was deposited in 56 bank accounts. He used 13 ATM cards and 17 phone numbers. Once the National ID card is implemented, transactions and movements of such wrongdoers will be easily traced and monitored. Identifying individuals accurately is crucial to ensure good governance and strengthen security. Many people have acquired fake citizenship cards. People even made fake passports. Implementation of National ID will control it. It is also related to our national image. It will help improve the status of our passport and add authenticity to our other documents as well.Once the National ID comes into wide use, our details will be traced and used by multiple agencies. State agencies and other institutions benefit from the integrated database as they can easily trace us. But how do you ensure our data isn’t misused and it doesn’t make us insecure?If you have a National ID card, you don’t need a hard copy of your driving licence. There is a backlog of around 2.1 million licences. The government has failed to print and distribute them. We told them, we have already procured 12 million cards. Of them, 3.2 million cards have already been printed and we still need to print around 8 million cards. Once the licence data is integrated with the National ID card, it will be shown there. Now, to come to your question, only the traffic authority can access the licence-related data. The device they use will trace only relevant data. Only an authorised agency will get access to the data and it can’t be used for anything other than the stated purpose. We give access to agencies like Nepal Rastra Bank, Nepal Telecommunication Authority and Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal. Then they regulate the things in their domain. No unauthorised body or individual can access it. Do the implementing agencies have infrastructure to use this technology?We are in a position to implement it in some parts of the country. Therefore, we are implementing it in phases. We are making it mandatory for certain services in 28 districts from mid-July. We should have started much earlier. It must be expedited.Lawmakers said in a Parliament meeting that the decision has ‘terrorised people’ in the 28 districts as locals feared they might be deprived of the services as the government has made National ID cards mandatory without first distributing them.We started the National ID registration process from 2018. Registration teams reached in each local ward except in Mugu and Humla districts of Karnali. It was carried out as a campaign. Even after the drive’s completion, the registration process was open in all the 77 districts, 54 area administration offices and in palika (local unit) centres. We also had registration centres in major downtowns. We receive data of around 4,000 registrations a day. So, there has been sufficient initiative and enough time to encourage people to get the number. Besides, if anyone in the 28 districts are still to get the ID number, they still have three months to register.You said only an ID number but no hard copy was needed to access any kind of service, right?Exactly. There is no provision that states one should produce a hard copy to get any service. You give the number and your biometrics to verify that you are the right person. Then, the official can crosscheck it in the database within seconds.Do all the implementing agencies have the devices that read the National ID cards?We have distributed 4,200 machines that read the cards in 333 local units of the 28 districts. Likewise, we have asked other local units and districts and some agencies such as banks to procure the devices and we have given the specifications based on their requirements. A device costs just around Rs 1,500. You can enter the number and place your thumbprint on it. We have trained relevant officials from all the local units for the purpose.How many cards can the department print at present?We can produce 1,500 cards an hour. But now we are producing only 1,800 a day. We have the strength to distribute 30,000 cards a day but are distributing only 5,000 a day.Again the same question. Then why are people not getting the cards?There is some communication gap. People who registered in 2018 or 2019 haven’t contacted us. We are giving them priority to clear the backlogs. But people who are newly-registered are showing more interest. So, we need to strike the right balance.When will the department be in a position to distribute the cards to all the people?At present, we can print 100,000 cards a month. We have a space to double the capacity. Meanwhile, people have now shown more interest. By enhancing our facilities’ capacity, we can print the pending 8 million cards in the next 40 months.What about election cards? Do we need to register for that and get the voting cards?In fact, the Election Commission doesn’t need to collect data and issue cards. We will talk to them. As a constitutional body, we have to readily make the data available for them. In fact, the National ID Card system can help the commission make voting arrangements for the Nepalis abroad because it can accurately identify the right person and can immediately update the integrated system here in Nepal about the votes cast in any country. This card will be helpful in conducting fair elections because the biometric data stored in this system will be perfect bases to identify the people and instantly update the activities in the database.You have emphasised replacement of other cards by the National ID cards. How long may it take to do so?We plan on giving priority to three sectors—banking, civil aviation and telecom. People right now need to fill separate forms for these services that have irked the service seekers. We have asked the bankers to buy the devices. We as a supplier are ready. Now the stakeholders should be ready too. It will benefit them because it helps control frauds.What if I don’t register for the National ID card?In the first place, you will be deprived of social security funds, pension, insurance policies. Likewise, the government will gradually make the card compulsory to receive many other services such as driving licence, land transaction, telephone numbers, bank accounts. How do you assure that our data stored in this system isn’t misused?See, the current practices make you more vulnerable. Because multiple agencies take your data for various purposes. Do they have a system to protect the data and ensure that it isn’t misused? But when your data is stored only by a dedicated government agency, it will be more secure as the agency is specialised for that. When other authorised agencies seek data, we give them access only to the relevant one. We have a National Identity Management Information System (NIMIS). We have maintained three layers of security—L1, L2, L3—to ensure foolproof security of the data. There are three servers.Are we dependent on any foreign company for any related service?So far, only one international vendor is involved but we are cutting down its involvement as well, with a plan to ultimately replace it by our own agency. The vendor now helps transfer collected data to the printing machine through the Automated Biometric Identification System (ABIS). But our plan is to do so through our own government agency or local vendor. We do all the other tasks. Security printing is done within the office basement where every movement of people is monitored and recorded. \nPrithvi Subba Gurung, deputy general secretary of the CPN-UML, is one of the leaders who strongly lobbied for a federal system while the Constituent Assembly was writing the constitution between 2008 to 2015. Eight years after the adoption of the federal democratic republican constitution, the federal system, particularly the provinces, are widely being criticised for their supposed failure to deliver. The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal asks former Gandaki chief minister Gurung what went wrong in the course of implementing the federal system.The implementation of the federal system has faced several hurdles since its adoption. Most provinces have for months failed even to form the governments, let alone run them efficiently. Where is the problem?We have adopted a federal system but are working against its spirit. Provinces should run autonomously. On some key issues, federal leaders and the party’s central bodies may give some direction to their provincial bodies. But most provincial activities are still centrally-governed even years after the adoption of federalism. So, our practices aren’t in line with the system. The provincial governments shouldn’t have been affected by the changes in the federal coalition. Such problems were seen in India years ago. But they have learned from their experience. In our case, leaders of major political parties treated the provincial governments as party chapters. The provincial governments are formed and run as per the constitution and all the three tiers of the governments are autonomous. The high commands in our political parties aren’t ready to accept the new constitutional setup.Are the provincial leaders equally responsible as they seek Kathmandu’s nod before taking any important decisions?They seek the centre’s support because they are trained in that way. They are too dependent on the centre. You said India learned by experience and now provinces there work more autonomously. But, in Nepal, provinces are now witnessing more problems than during their first tenure, which is evident also in the difficulties in government formation in multiple provinces. Why couldn’t they learn from the five-year experience?Nepal’s leaders and political parties are still not committed to federalism. They have failed to implement the federal system as per the spirit of the constitution. This is the major problem. The big parties as well as their leaders are guided by a centralised mindset and still prefer working in a unitary system. We should not forget that we transformed the executive and legislative bodies into three tiers of federal systems. But our judiciary retained the old structure. Therefore, the judiciary doesn’t accept the federal system and its practice in a true sense. Its verdicts reflect the same.The role of Speakers and Province Heads has courted controversies in multiple provinces. The top court invalidated some of their decisions. Is it because of lack of clarity, faults in our constitutional provisions, or is it because of the leaders?Speaker and Province Head are political posts created in accordance with constitutional provisions. When overall politics is dirty and unhealthy, those taking up these responsibilities also feel compelled to resort to similar tactics. When overall politics improves, they automatically make better decisions. Mainly there is no leader in the high command who completely owns federalism and is determined to implement it in its true spirit. This government in its policies and programmes unveiled last month had rightly said that “protecting federalism and strengthening the federal democratic republic is our top priority”. But the budget failed to introduce programmes as per the promises made in the policies and programmes.How do we correct these anomalies? Where do we begin?We are in a complex situation. Many have started to float the idea of making amendments to the constitution. But we shouldn’t forget that various forces and stakeholders had their own positions during constitution-making. They made compromises and found middle grounds to promulgate the constitution. If we go for amendments, they all will return to their respective stances. Some may want to revive the Hindu Kingdom while others will stand against it. Some leaders even within Nepali Congress have started to advocate for constitutional monarchy. But we can’t regress to the monarchical system. We can’t renounce secularism and an inclusive democratic system. We can’t backtrack on our commitment to a socialism-oriented system. We may explore some changes in our electoral system or form of governance without going against these key features of our constitution but we can’t destabilise the charter. What are the major flaws to be fixed?There are some. For instance, provinces have no role in education. The responsibility of education up to secondary level is given to the local level. And, everything is controlled by the federal government. The local units are entrusted with key responsibilities such as developing curriculum, overseeing the issues of career developments of teachers and staffers and their promotion as well as transfers etcetera. Local units can’t do all of these things efficiently as they have their own limitations. How can a local unit transfer a teacher from Kaski to Lamjung? Provinces should have been given such responsibilities. The power has been centralised at Singha Durbar. Such is also the situation in other sectors.Though the proportional representation (PR) system is hailed as one of the most beautiful features of our constitution in terms of ensuring inclusion, it has also been blamed for political instability. Many have demanded revision in the electoral system.The major political parties such as the CPN-UML and Nepali Congress have not trained their party members on the proper implementation of key constitutional features such as federalism and electoral system. The party members and general people have either wrongly understood it, or have negative impressions about the systems. These systems were adopted with an objective to resolve our decade-long conflict and address the concerns of the historically marginalised communities and even mainstream some groups through an inclusive democratic system. The idea was to integrate all the communities and maintain unity in diversity. After holding years-long debates on various options, we agreed on the mixed electoral system so as to reflect our diversity in the state agencies.As the proverb goes, “the bad workman blames his tools”, our leaders are blaming the system for their failure to secure a majority by winning people’s trust. Many countries that practise similar electoral systems have progressed. Our electoral system and the form of governance are not causing political instability. Many countries have adopted a parliamentary system and many others have practised the presidential model. Countries have progressed in both the systems. Also, there are examples of failures under both setups. So, the problem lies in our political parties and leaders, not in the systems. Shouldn’t political parties like the UML and Congress work with a plan to secure a majority by winning people’s trust? They aren’t training their focus on that but blaming the system. At times, they have squandered the majority as well and have failed to keep the party intact. Isn’t it our [leaders’] failure?Some argue that the issue of the fractured mandate can be addressed by increasing the threshold ceiling for political parties to be eligible to get PR votes and that can be done by amending election laws. Does it help?This is the idea coming from big political parties because they get more votes when fringe parties disqualify for PR votes. But a higher ceiling may deprive many small parties from representing certain communities. So, this goes against the spirit of inclusion. What we need is a good coalition culture. If we see the trend of recent decades, Indian politicians have become much more mature in this context. In the past, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi accommodated his electoral alliance partners in his ruling coalition even though his party won the majority single-handedly. If we scrap the inclusive electoral system, won’t the marginalised communities again revolt? We should be careful about that.At times, leaders have helped dissident groups split their party. These are the same leaders who issued an ordinance to change the provision that required a group within a political party to show support of 40 percent members of the party’s central committee “and” the parliamentary party. Only then could it split. They changed the threshold to 20 percent, and the “and” provision had been changed to “or”. The provision of requiring 40 percent support on both sides had earlier been included to ensure political stability. But the leaders who are helping party divisions are blaming the system for instability in the country. So, we [leaders] have to mend our ways, not blame the system. The Rastriya Swantantra Party, the fourth-largest in the lower house, has officially said that it wants to overhaul the federal system and drastically downsize the provinces. Also, leaders within the major parties who earlier stood in favour of federalism have started criticising it. On Saturday, Congress General Secretary Gagan Thapa said the country can’t sustain the provinces in their present form. What is your view?I am one of those who advocated for a federal system even before the first Constituent Assembly because Nepal is a country full of discrimination based on caste, class, region and religion. We advocated for the system to do away with these discriminations and find a system to maintain unity within diversity. Federalism is the best system to promote national unity as all groups get their own space as per their unique features. For instance, if you make multiple rooms in a building, you can give space and adjust more people. But if you keep many people inside a big room, they will have difficulties—no matter how big the room is. We should strengthen the federal system. We can’t regress.Then, why do many people see provinces as a burden?In Nepal, the federal system was projected as a structure that resulted in huge liability to the state coffers. But the facts don’t substantiate it. A local unit in the federal structure replaced many erstwhile Village Development Committees (VDCs). For instance, in my home district of Lamjung, eight palikas covered the areas of 61 VDCs, and the expenditure of the current eight local units is no more than that of the erstwhile 61 VDCs. Now we don’t need 77 district coordination committees. They can be scrapped. No province needs more than seven ministers. Likewise, the federal Cabinet can be drastically downsized. Why do we need a 25-strong Cabinet at the centre when we already have seven other provincial cabinets? Twelve ministries are enough at the centre, as suggested by the high level commission on administration reform.There are many departments and divisions that were designed under the unitary system that have become completely redundant in the federal setup. So many project offices established over two decades ago based on the needs of that time are still there. These irrelevant bodies should be scrapped. This is how we can significantly cut down on administrative costs. Leaders and people don’t discuss that. They only blame provinces. \nAmidst allegations of cooperative scams involving Home Minister Rabi Lamichhane, the Nepali Congress's Jiban Pariyar explains the culmination of weeks-long negotiations to establish the terms of reference for a parliamentary committee to investigate the matter, emphasizing the inclusion of relevant parties and depositors' interests.\nAmnesty International's Secretary General observes a global decline in human rights protection, citing shrinking civic space, weaponization of laws, impunity, populist authoritarianism, and the threat of unregulated AI and spyware, urging the Nepali government to improve transitional justice, address excessive force by police, and release the imprisoned media owner, while advocating for climate justice and international support for Nepal's vulnerability to climate change.\nRainfall and thunderstorms predicted across Nepal, with heavy rainfall likely in Koshi, Madhesh, Bagmati, and Gandaki provinces.\nPartly to generally cloudy weather with heavy rainfall in Koshi, Bagmati, and Gandaki, light to moderate rainfall expected countrywide, and continued rainfall throughout the night brings relief from the heat.\nSunday's weather forecast predicts partly cloudy skies with chances of light to heavy rain, thunder, and lightning in various provinces, and Nepalgunj recorded the highest temperature of 38.2 degrees Celsius.\nPartly to generally cloudy weather and light to moderate rain with thunder predicted for Koshi, Madhesh, Lumbini, hilly Bagmati, and Gandaki regions of Nepal.\nThe Meteorological Forecasting Division has forecast partly to generally cloudy weather in Koshi, Madhesh, Bagmati, and Gandaki provinces, as well as the hilly regions of Lumbini.

Write it in the form of inspiring story not news article or event.\n    \n    Story:\nOnce upon a time, nestled between the towering peaks of the Himalayas and the lush jungles of the Terai, there was a country named Nepal. Though still a developing nation, Nepal was a land of profound beauty and deep-rooted cultural heritage. The residents of Nepal faced many challenges, but beneath these hardships lay a resilient spirit and an unyielding hope for the future.\n\nThis enchanting land, where Mount Everest reaches towards the skies and the air carries a mix of incense and cool mountain breezes, was more than a geographical marvel. It was a mosaic of cultures, languages, and traditions, a testament to human endeavor against all odds. Nepal's history, from the unification under King Prithvi Narayan Shah to its transformation into a federal democratic republic, told a story of aspiration and endurance.\n\nIn recent years, the people of Nepal, with their indomitable will, had taken strides towards rebuilding and reimagining their country. They turned their struggles into stepping stones, each challenge a chapter in their ongoing saga. The shift from a monarchy to a republic had not only changed governance but had woven a new tapestry of democratic values and collective decision-making.\n\nEconomically, while agriculture continued to sustain a large part of its population, Nepal had begun to harness the potential of its picturesque landscapes, developing sustainable tourism that promised to preserve their natural heritage while boosting local economies. Communities living in the shadows of the Himalayas had become stewards of the earth, protecting the biodiversity that made their country unique.\n\nEach day brought new stories. Whether it was a festival in Kathmandu, a technological advance in Pokhara, or a conservation effort in Chitwan, these events were threads in the vibrant quilt of Nepali life. These stories, updated daily, reflected the pulse of progress and the spirit of hope that characterized this resilient nation.\n\nAnd so, as Nepal moved forward, each moment was not just a passage of time but a promise of potential, a narrative of a nation perennially climbing towards tomorrow, guided by the legacy of its past and the dreams of its future.\n\nNews events:\nNepal and China held diplomatic consultations, discussing bilateral relations, the Belt and Road Initiative implementation plan, economic corridors, transit protocols, airport operations, and foreign minister-level mechanism upgrades.\nCooperative victims resumed their protest in Kathmandu demanding the government's implementation of agreements reached with ministers and criticizing the parliamentary special committee's impartiality in investigating the cooperative scam.\nOver 1,000 A(H1N1) infections, along with other influenza strains, have been detected in Nepal, prompting concerns over undiagnosed cases and the potential for a respiratory virus pandemic due to low vaccination rates and inadequate surveillance.\nNepal urges Pakistan and Bangladesh to reduce tariffs on large cardamom exports, as India dominates the trade but re-exports to those countries with higher prices.\nThe House of Representatives endorsed the 1.86 trillion rupee budget for fiscal 2024-25, rejecting proposals to reduce expenditures for various ministries.\nThe Supreme Court on Tuesday convicted five people, including former minister for economic affairs of Madhesh Province Bijaya Kumar Yadav, in a corruption case.The bench of Special Court chairperson Tek Narayan Kunwar and members Tej Narayan Singh Rai and Muraribabu Shrestha convicted them of corruption in the snake breeding programme of the Jhala Nath Khanal Academy of Health Sciences.Academy chair Rewati Prasad Pant, general secretary Nawaraj Bhandari, treasurer Niraj Bhandari and member Devendra Raya were also pronounced guilty. The next hearing will determine the punishment for them.The then mayor of Lalbandi Municipality Man Bahadur Khadka and the then economic affairs secretary of the Madhesh government Prem Kumar Shrestha have been acquitted.On October 8 last year, the Commission for the Investigation of Abuse of Authority filed a Rs170.9 million corruption case against seven individuals, including the then minister. They were accused of embezzling government funds by diverting them from their original purpose. \nThe Supreme Court on Tuesday dismissed a writ petition filed by former chief minister and Nepali Congress lawmaker Kedar Karki challenging the government formation in Koshi Province.A full bench of Justices Kumar Regmi, Nahakul Subedi and Aziz Musalman quashed the writ petition filed against Chief Minister Hikmat Karki.Following the apex court’s decision, Hikmat Karki will continue as the chief minister.The former chief minister moved the apex court, claiming Hikmat Karki’s appointment was unconstitutional. He has asked the court to issue mandamus, certiorari, and quo warranto orders to reinstate him as the chief minister.On May 9, Province Head Parshuram Khapung appointed Hikmat Karki as per Article 168 (5) of the constitution after the UML leader staked his claim to the post with the support of 52 lawmakers. The support of 47 lawmakers is required for a majority to form the government in the 93-strong assembly. It is Hikmat Karki’s third stint as a chief minister and the sixth government in Koshi in 17 months after the 2022 November elections. He was elected to the provincial assembly from Jhapa Constituency-5 (1). \nClimate change has caused deadly snakes and dengue-carrying mosquitoes to expand their habitats into Nepal's mountainous areas, while wild animals have also migrated to higher elevations.\nNepal's alternative political scene, while popular, lacks focus on Dalit issues, perpetuating apathy and exclusion towards the Dalit community, necessitating the creation of a Dalit-led, non-partisan organization to address and rectify this neglect.\nPolarisation has surged globally, benefiting right-wing agendas due to failed promises and ineffective solutions from centrist/left-leaning parties in addressing societal issues like abortion rights, migration, economic inequality, foreign policy, and climate crisis.\nA parliamentary committee investigating cooperative scandals faces jurisdictional challenges, potentially protecting a deputy prime minister accused of money laundering.\nNepal and China commit to enhance bilateral cooperation in various areas, including trade, investment, infrastructure, and tourism, while celebrating the 70th anniversary of diplomatic relations in 2025.\nKenyan police fatally shot at least five protesters and injured dozens as they tried to storm parliament to protest tax increases, with clashes and demonstrations also occurring in other cities.\nDeputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Narayan Kaji Shrestha has reiterated Nepal’s commitment to regional cooperation and multilateralism and stressed the need to implement the Asia Cooperation Dialogue Vision 2030 and the ACD Blueprint 2021-2030.The foreign minister made the remarks in his address to the 19th ministerial meeting of the Asia Cooperation Dialogue held in Tehran, Iran, on Monday, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a press statement.Shrestha said ACD has evolved as an Asia-wide regional forum for open and consultative dialogues on pressing issues impacting the region and beyond.According to the foreign ministry, he highlighted challenges posed by Covid-19, climate change, global economic recession, rising conflicts, and geopolitical rivalry. Shrestha also underlines the importance of collective vision, unity, solidarity, and mutual collaboration for a more integrated, resilient, and prosperous Asia.The ministerial meeting adopted the documents, namely, the Guiding Principles for the Functioning of the Asia Cooperation Dialogue Secretariat and the ACD Rules of Procedures, which provide a framework for cooperation among ACD members and an important basis for institutional strengthening of the ACD Secretariat.On the sidelines of the meeting, Shrestha held bilateral meetings with Ali Bagheri, acting foreign minister of Iran; U Than Swe, deputy prime minister and minister of foreign affairs of Myanmar; Abdullatif bin Rashid Alzayani, minister of foreign affairs of Bahrain; Abdullah Ali Al-Yahya, minister of foreign affairs of Kuwait; Walid bin Abdul Karim Al Khraiji, vice minister for foreign affairs of Saudi Arabia; Andrei Rudenko, deputy minister of foreign affairs of Russia and discussed on various matters of mutual interests including pressing regional and global issues.As a member of the Asia Cooperation Dialogue since 2016, Nepal has been engaging with other Asian member states with a view to promoting various areas of mutual benefits and complementarities, the foreign ministry said. \nThe National Examinations Board is preparing to publish the results of this year's Secondary Education Examinations (SEE) by Friday.Mahashram Sharma, the NEB chair, said they are working to publish the results as soon as possible. “The results will be out by Friday,” he said.The Office of the Controller of Examinations under the board said the process of entering marks after cross-checking and converting them into grades is in its final stage. The office said a board meeting will publicise the results once the process is completed.The SEE results can viewed on www. results.ekantipur.com once published.A total of 504,414 students attended the examinations held from March 28 to April 9. Among them, 250,772 were girls, 253,627 were boys, and 15 were gender minorities.This year, the exams were conducted based on the new syllabus, and the results will be published using the new grading system.Under the new system, each SEE student must score at least 35 percent mark in the theoretical exams to qualify for higher studies. Students failing to secure it in theoretical exams will not be eligible to enrol in class 11 and will receive their results in the non-graded category. Previously, students received grades if they scored at least 35 marks combined from theoretical and practical exams. From now on, there will be separate grading for theoretical and practical exams. The new curriculum has introduced a system where each subject, including mathematics, will have a 25-mark practical exam and a 75-mark theoretical exam. The practical exams are conducted by the schools themselves, and the obtained marks are sent to the board. \nAn Indian court on Tuesday extended a hold on a lower court’s order granting bail to Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal in a graft case, leaving the key opposition leader in pre-trial detention.India’s federal financial crime-fighting agency arrested Kejriwal, a fierce critic of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, in March on corruption allegations relating to the capital’s liquor policy - accusations he has denied and said are politically motivated.Kejriwal was granted bail by a city court on Thursday but investigators challenged the order in the Delhi High Court, which suspended the bail order as it considered the challenge. \nAfghanistan reached the semi-finals of the Twenty20 World Cup with a dramatic eight-run victory over Bangladesh under the Duckworth Lewis System in St Vincent on Monday, joining India as the qualifiers from Group 1 and sending Australia home.Bangladesh also had a chance to progress or send Australia through with a victory but the Afghans dismissed them for 105 to take the win they needed to set up a first World Cup semi-final against South Africa in Trinidad on Wednesday.Afghanistan hopes were dented when they were restricted to a modest 115-5 but skipper Rashid Khan took 4-23 and Naveen-ul-Haq 4-26 in a defiant bowling effort that delivered victory.The last few overs were high drama played out well past midnight local time with Bangladesh needing roughly a run a ball and the DLS calculations in case of more rain changing with every wicket and boundary.Naveen delivered the coup de grace in the penultimate over by bowling Taskin Ahmed and trapping Mustafizur Rahman in front off consecutive balls, triggering tearful celebrations from his team mates.India, who beat Australia by 24 runs earlier in St Lucia to leave the qualification hopes of the 2021 champions hanging by a thread, will take on title holders England in the second semi-final in Guyana on Thursday.Rashid won the toss and elected to bat first, sending out the same team that stunned Australia at the same Arnos Vale Ground on Saturday to give themselves a shot at the semis.Openers Rahmanullah Gurbaz and Ibrahim Zadran scored a third century partnership of the tournament to build the foundation for that upset and Bangladesh were desperate to separate them quickly.The Bangladesh bowlers made scoring mighty hard as they combined for 66 dot balls over the innings but they were unable to break the partnership until the 11th over when it was worth 59 runs.Rishad Hossain (3-26) did the damage by having Ibrahim caught on the offside for 18 and the leg spinner returned to remove Gurbaz for 43 as Afghanistan collapsed from 84-1 to 93-5 in 11 balls.Afghan skipper Rashid rallied with three sixes in his 10-ball 19 and was so desperate to score that he hurled his bat down the wicket at his batting partner Karim Janat in fury when refused a second run in the final over.After a brief rain delay, Bangladesh set off at a fair lick as they chased the win in 12.1 overs that they needed to get their run rate up.Left-arm seamer Fazalhaq Farooqi dismissed Tanzid Hasan lbw in the second over and Naveen removed Najmul Hossain Shanto and Shakib Al Hasan in successive balls before another shower swept in with the score at 31-3.Litton Das and Soumya Sarkar bumped the score up to 46-3 by the end of the powerplay but Rashid brought himself on and bowled the latter for 10 from his fourth delivery.Rashid came back on to dismiss Towhid Hridoy (14), captain Najmul Hossain Shanto and Hossain, the latter two in successive balls to reduce Bangladesh to 80-7 just before another shower forced the players off again.Bangladesh’s target was reduced to 114 in 19 overs after the break but their hopes of reaching the semi-finals were now gone, though opener Litton Das stood firm even as his batting partners departed in the late drama to score 54 not out. \nWikiLeaks founder Julian Assange is due to plead guilty this week to violating US espionage law, in a deal that will end his imprisonment in Britain and allow him to return home to Australia, ending a 14-year legal odyssey.Assange, 52, has agreed to plead guilty to a single criminal count of conspiring to obtain and disclose classified US national defence documents, according to filings in the US District Court for the Northern Mariana Islands.He is due to be sentenced to 62 months of time already served at a hearing on the island of Saipan at 9am local time on Wednesday (2300 GMT Tuesday).Assange left Belmarsh prison in the UK on Monday before being bailed by the UK High Court and boarding a flight that afternoon, Wikileaks said in a statement posted on social media platform X.“This is the result of a global campaign that spanned grass-roots organisers, press freedom campaigners, legislators and leaders from across the political spectrum, all the way to the United Nations,” the statement said.A video posted on X by Wikileaks showed Assange dressed in a blue shirt and jeans signing a document before boarding a private jet with the markings of charter firm VistaJet.He will return to Australia after the hearing, the Wikileaks statement added, referring to the hearing in Saipan.“Julian is free!!!!” his wife, Stella Assange, said in a post on X.“Words cannot express our immense gratitude to YOU - yes YOU, who have all mobilised for years and years to make this come true.”The only VistaJet plane that departed Stansted on Monday afternoon was headed to Bangkok, FlightRadar24 data shows. A spokesperson for Assange in Australia declined to comment on his flight plans. VistaJet did not immediately respond to a request for comment.The Australian government, led by Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, has been pressing for Assange’s release but declined to comment on the legal proceedings as they were ongoing.“Prime Minister Albanese has been clear - Mr Assange’s case has dragged on for too long and there is nothing to be gained by his continued incarceration,” a government spokesperson said.A lawyer for Assange did not immediately respond to a request for comment.HISTORIC CHARGESWikiLeaks in 2010 released hundreds of thousands of classified US military documents on Washington’s wars in Afghanistan and Iraq - the largest security breaches of their kind in US military history - along with swaths of diplomatic cables.Assange was indicted during former President Donald Trump’s administration over WikiLeaks’ mass release of secret US documents, which were leaked by Chelsea Manning, a former US military intelligence analyst who was also prosecuted under the Espionage Act.The trove of more than 700,000 documents included diplomatic cables and battlefield accounts such as a 2007 video of a US Apache helicopter firing at suspected insurgents in Iraq, killing a dozen people including two Reuters news staff. That video was released in 2010.The charges against Assange sparked outrage among his many global supporters who have long argued that Assange as the publisher of Wikileaks should not face charges typically used against federal government employees who steal or leak information.Many press freedom advocates have argued that criminally charging Assange represents a threat to free speech.“A plea deal would avert the worst-case scenario for press freedom, but this deal contemplates that Assange will have served five years in prison for activities that journalists engage in every day,” said Jameel Jaffer, executive director of free speech organisation Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University.“It will cast a long shadow over the most important kinds of journalism, not just in this country but around the world.”LONG ODYSSEYAssange was first arrested in Britain in 2010 on a European arrest warrant after Swedish authorities said they wanted to question him over sex-crime allegations that were later dropped. He fled to Ecuador’s embassy, where he remained for seven years, to avoid extradition to Sweden.He was dragged out of the embassy in 2019 and jailed for skipping bail. He has been in London's Belmarsh top security jail ever since, from where he has for almost five years been fighting extradition to the United States.Those five years of confinement are similar to the sentence imposed on Reality Winner, an Air Force veteran and former intelligence contractor, who was sentenced to 63 months after she removed classified materials and mailed them to a news outlet.While in Belmarsh Assange married his partner Stella with whom he had two children while he was holed up in the Ecuadorean embassy. \nFonepay on Tuesday said it processed UPI payments totalling over Rs250 million in volume and exceeding 100,000 transactions across Nepal since the launching of the cross-border payment system in February.This surge aligns perfectly with the peak season for Indian travellers visiting Nepal, which is expected to reach record numbers this year, Fonepay said in a statement.UPI payments eliminate the need to exchange currency or carry cash, allowing for a seamless travel experience. The convenience, security, and immediacy of UPI payments through the Fonepay network have been pivotal in driving the increase in transactions from Indian tourists, making their visits to Nepal more convenient and enjoyable, Fonepay said in a statement.“This seamless payment solution is a key factor in the rising popularity of Nepal as a preferred destination for Indian travellers,” reads the statement.Fonepay said it has established itself as the frontrunner in facilitating UPI payments in Nepal with a strong network. “The rapid adoption of UPI payments in Nepal is evidence to the growing demand for convenient and secure digital payments,” said Diwas Kumar, CEO at Fonepay. “We are thrilled to play a key role in this digital transformation and empower both Nepali citizens and Indian visitors with seamless payment options.\"Fonepay said it is fully prepared, both technically and operationally, to enable Nepalese citizens to make UPI payments in India. \nThe advocates for justice for victims of conflict-related sexual violence (CRSV) have objected to the decision by local governments to start registration of such victims, questioning its legality and assurance of confidentiality.Following directives from the Ministry of Home Affairs, a number of local governments have started collecting applications from the victims of conflict-related sexual violence.The applications have been called from women and girls who faced sexual violence at the hands of state security forces and then Maoist rebels, but whose cases are missing from the state’s records of victims. Since the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) is the authorised body to collect the complaints, advocates for the victims doubt the legitimacy of the applications solicited by the local governments. “What will be the legality of the applications? Will they be recognised by the TRC? As far as I know, the TRC will not accept them,” said Devi Khadka, coordinator of the National Association of Conflict Rape Victims, a network of CRSV victims.The government issued a circular to the local governments to collect the applications with the primary objective of providing relief and compensation to the insurgency-era victims of rape and sexual assault. The state continues to neglect such victims. Neither have they been recognised by the state nor have they received any relief from the government. As many as 63,718 complaints have been registered with the TRC. However, only 314, less than half a percent of the total, are related to rape and sexual violence. Very few victims lodged complaints as they were not convinced that their records would be kept confidential, according to Khadka. “We are not convinced that the local governments can maintain confidentiality. Unlike other victims, they cannot come out on the open because of the social stigma associated,” she said. “Most victims of rape and sexual violence haven’t revealed their ordeals even to their husbands and close family members. Doing so means breaking their families.”If Khadka’s claim is anything to go by, seven insurgency-era victims of rape and sexual violence from a local unit in the Sudurpaschim Province are in trouble as it could not keep their secrets. The representatives at the local level, however, say they are working to support the victims as per the federal government’s circular. “Some 35 victims have applied at our municipality. We are serious about maintaining their confidentiality,” Tilakram Lamsal, mayor at Thakurbaba Municipality in Bardiya, told the Post. He, however, said he was unaware whether the TRC or the federal government will recognise the applications they have collected.Officials at the home ministry also say they are not sure about the legality of the complaints. Radha Kumari Shrestha, an officer with the Peace Promotion Department at the Ministry of Home Affairs, said they got the circular to register the victims for their documentation and to provide relief and reparations. “I am not sure whether the TRC will own up the applications,” she told the Post, adding that respective local governments are responsible for maintaining confidentiality.Through the national budget the federal government has announced plans to create a peace fund of Rs1 billion to provide compensation and financial support to conflict victims. Similarly, different local governments also have allocated budgets to support conflict victims including the CRSV. After months-long discussions, cross-party lawmakers have agreed to allow three months for the registration of the complaints by the victims who missed out on doing so in the past. The victims say the government and parties should prioritise endorsing the amendment bill to the Enforced Disappearances Enquiry, Truth and Reconciliation Commission Act, which will formally open the doors for the TRC to receive the complaints.Laxmi Pokharel, a human rights lawyer with the International Court of Jurists, said the idea of allowing the local governments to keep records of victims is not wrong. However, there are no proper mechanisms at the local units to safely keep the records of the victims of rape and sexual violence. “There is no uniformity among the local governments in providing relief. While some are working actively, several others are doing nothing. This is leading to disparity,” she told the Post. “The federal government should formulate a uniform policy in providing relief, one that will be applicable across the country.”Currently, the Khadka-led organisation has been continuously working to screen the physical and mental health of CRSV victims. A recent medical test conducted among 38 rape victims from the Maoist insurgency showed 11 of them had cancer. Similarly, an additional eight need immediate surgery to remove their uterus. “Further tests are being conducted to ascertain the stage of their cancer. This is very serious,” said Khadka. In the medical tests conducted in December last year, an overwhelming 70 percent of the 127 victims had one or more reproductive health-related complications. The health condition of five of them was bad enough to need regular tests and treatment.  \nThe Nepal-India relationship is complex, wide-ranging and deep, making it difficult to fathom. That is why, despite a long apprenticeship in bilateral relations, I consider myself a novice on the subject. Sometimes, our limited knowledge creates misunderstanding and distrust even if the relationship remains intact. For the past 60 years or so, some people have tried to define the Nepal-India relationship in their own emotional ways but have failed to make any dent without India’s wish. Their concern is understandable when seen from the perspective of broad principles of sovereign equality, territorial integrity and peaceful coexistence, forgetting that inter-state relations are guided more by pragmatism than principles. For any country, national interest is supreme while conducting foreign policies. Most politicians and intellectuals driven by emotions forget that the conditions surrounding them are more deterministic than their feelings. Here comes the question of geo-politics, geo-economics and geo-strategic contexts.The Nepal-India relationship since the Treaty of Sugauli continues to define both limitations of powers and the relationship pattern. Even if some minor adjustments or changes occur, the substance and nature of bilateral relations remain the same. For some Nepalis, symbols matter more than substance, which is vital for conducting bilateral ties. Even then, both countries do not deviate from the main course of the unchanged relationship. India, too, has not departed from conventional policy by trying to operate within the same parameters as the old rulers. Even if the situation and context changed, the basics of the relationship remain the same.India does not like to disturb the structure of the relationship, relating it to its larger national security issue. It seems that even in the future, apart from some minor adjustments, it is unlikely to be drastically altered. Indians think opening the 1950 Treaty is like opening the “pandora’s box” and, hence, needs to be cautiously handled. Without being on the firm ground of reality, Nepalis will experience more woes. Knowing the implications and given the limited strategic autonomy, King Mahendra, apparently a die-hard nationalist, also didn’t raise the issue of the 1950 treaty. Still, policy measures adopted by the royal government and India have led to the erosion of some treaty provisions. Coming close on the heels of the continuity of the relationship, the former foreign secretary and Indian ambassador to Nepal, Shyam Saran, said at a talk programme recently, “There will be more continuity than departure in India’s foreign policy in coming days–in rhetoric and style”. Then what alternative approach can Nepal take? I think focusing on the country’s development, projection of good governance and image by showing the ability to prosper and make people confident should be the strategy. If all-round development takes place by raising people's life standards, national confidence and maturity would grow, eventually leading to better cooperation with the immediate neighbours. The status of a nation is not raised by too much politicisation of relationships, as we have been witnessing for over six decades. Nor is foreign policy conducted through an emotional approach alone. Some developmental activities and formal and informal channels used by both sides to sort out immediate problems arising from time to time can measure how the two countries have stabilised bilateral relations and cooperative endeavours since the 1950s. Regime changes have not at all affected the continuity of the developmental process. Today, the development pace is faster than before. The political environment, irrespective of governments, is favourable, as parties and leaders seem to have understood the significance of development despite their subjective views on various issues. Now, Nepal and India have reached an understanding of purchasing 10000 megawatts of electricity by India and facilitating Nepal’s use of the Indian corridor for power sale to Bangladesh. Since Nepal and India are two separate nations politically and historically, civilisational commonalities do not always work when the question of nation-state arises. Therefore, it is natural that some divergent approaches to events and developments are noticed not to the extent of damaging the structure and dynamics of bilateral relationships. Some issues are perceived differently by the elites of the two countries. For example, some patches of the border often trigger controversy. The two governments have claimed that 97 percent of the border problem will be solved if both sides officially agree. But Nepal is not prepared to agree unless other disputed territories such as Sushta, Kalapanri-Lipulekh and Limpiadhura are settled. Sushta’s problem could have been settled long ago as it is not serious from an Indian security point of view. The Kalapani issue is complex because India considers it settled, but it contrasts with Nepal’s claim that goes far beyond the existing border. Since the newly adopted map called chuche naksa (pointed map) that shows the border up to Limpiadhura has already been passed by the Nepali Parliament by a two-thirds majority after reaching some sort of national consensus, it has become more complex. India reacted to Nepal’s action as a unilateral “cartographic assertion”, adding that the lands claimed by Nepal belong to India. The issue has become more complicated because of the long Indian rule (bhogchalan) and Nepal’s new claim as its territory. In addition to such complex issues, minor problems such as waterlogging in some parts of the Tarai, inundation, floods and trade deficit reduction are nagging. However, the issue of balance of trade entirely lies with Nepal’s capacity to enhance production and make Nepali products market-worthy in India and elsewhere. Only then can Nepal expect India’s cooperation to facilitate Nepali products to enter the Indian market. Mutual trust and confidence on both sides are essential to resolve ensuing differences, big or small. Moreover, perception, rather than reality, gives grounds for distrust. India should not be too suspicious of Nepal’s relations with China and other Western powers, especially the US, as it is armed with leverage over Nepal because, even if it wishes, the latter cannot cross the Rubicon due to various compulsions.   \nThe day I met Rima (name changed), it was already late morning and she was anxious. There were around seven women in a small room. She rocked nervously and reiterated that she did not want to talk. We told her she did not have to. An hour later, we could not stop her from telling her story.Rima’s body was like a battleground in itself. It was 2001: Peace talks between the government and the then rebels had just failed. Nepal Army officials came to Rima’s house and arrested her. She was kept in captivity and repeatedly raped for 14 months by army personnel. She was only 14 at the time. She told her story in minute detail: How her limbs swelled up after being tied up, how the sounds of boots made her heart thump and how the men stomped on her breasts with those boots. She was stoic in her storytelling. Everyone almost forgot to breathe. But what upsets Rima now is not only her past. Like many other women in the world who were sexually abused in conflict, Rima faced social ostracism once the war ended, and twisted versions of social morality and patriarchy won once again. Rima tried to live with dignity. Rima’s quiet storytelling broke into loud sobs when she started talking about her children. Her inability to give them a decent life broke her resolve. Her strength in times of great vulnerability is what breaks my heart. This meeting was in 2021, when we were still in the uncertain stages of shooting our film, Devi. I was with Devi Khadka, our protagonist, a survivor of sexual violence in Nepal’s decade-long conflict. At the time, Devi was still quite unsure about what she could do with other victims like herself, but she wanted to investigate. We had followed her journey and found ourselves in a room of forgotten women: Girls and women who had been sexually abused and raped during Nepal’s conflict. But their existence, while cursorily accepted by the state, had been effectively erased from Nepal’s history.Devi Khadka’s story had haunted me for years. I’d read about her in the newspapers, shocked at some of the commentary, unable to grasp the callousness of it. Khadka was arrested, tortured and raped in custody by Nepal Police personnel in 1997. She was made to tell her story to the press by the Maoist Party after she was released in 1998. A well-known ‘feminist’ columnist wrote a piece in the Nepali Patra weekly in defence of the police, questioning the veracity of the then seventeen-year-old traumatised girl.It took years for Devi to trust the press, and I am humbled that she trusted me to tell her story. It took four more years of telling me her story, listening back to versions of her own story, and analysing it that helped her sharpen her vision. The very act of telling one's story can give the storyteller agency. When Devi first talked to me, she was a district leader of the Maoist party, haunted by the loss of her brother, Rit Bahadur, during the conflict. Like an automaton, she fulfilled the role of a Maoist cadre, telling herself that the party was as loyal to her as she was to the party. But as she met more victims, the change in her was palpable. For those who have not seen this change, it’s easy to dismiss Devi Khadka on so many grounds: Devi can barely understand English, the language of the world of development. She has had only one day of formal education, after all. But she can, in her mother tongue, give an eloquent expression of how wartime sexual violence survivors in Nepal can be addressed. She is doing her undergraduate studies, totally self-taught, and she pours through legal documents and policy papers, catching details that escape many. She can stand on stage, tell her story and move people to action. And she can be sharp. When someone asked her if she can handle budgets as a non-English speaker, she calmly replied, “I’ve managed ministries. Of course I can handle it. If you are asking if I can handle your language, I can always get hired help.” Yet, some from Nepal’s transitional justice community have been unforgiving of Devi, calling her “political” and disingenuous. However, this is hardly a time for pettiness.My job as a filmmaker has allowed me to examine Devi. I’ve seen the trauma that wartime rape has left her with and the struggle she still undergoes to overcome the demons left behind by it. But it is the story of many Rimas, raped by the state forces or violated by the Maoists, and forsaken by both, that has shaken Devi to the core. Once committed, she’s been steadfast. With very little support, she has built a network of survivors, lobbied with the government and other development actors, worked with human rights activists, and has added to the work of many others who have fought for justice to make a tangible impact on Nepal’s transitional justice process. The amended Transitional Justice bill, currently in Parliament, has, for the first time, included wartime sexual violence survivors and opened ways for them to get reparations and justice. Perhaps a better way to understand Devi today is as a human rights activist with political acumen. Storytelling is an act of resistance. It was for Devi but for me as well—a way of expressing solidarity to all the women who have suffered sexual violence during the war (and in peacetime). For every year that Nepal’s transitional justice process remains incomplete, women like Rima will keep suffering while perpetrators remain free. The wounds of the likes of Rima have not healed. For now, Nepal’s wartime rape survivors have some hope with this bill. Devi Khadka, with other survivors, will push on. With the other players in the field who are schooled in the language and the world of development, welcoming Devi as an equal player—not a victim any more, but a leader—will strengthen the cause.Shrestha is a filmmaker and a journalist.

Keep your heads high,” world cricket governing body International Cricket Council wrote on X, formerly Twitter.South Africa legend Dale Steyn called the Nepal vs South Africa game the “Match of the Tournament” on ICC’s Digital Daily show.“It would’ve been the talk of the tournament if Nepal would’ve gotten over the line. It would’ve been fantastic, and they deserved to win,” Steyn said. “[This was] the match of the tournament to be honest with you. I saw people crying in the stands, it shows how much it means to them, and that’s what cricket is all about.”Indian cricket commentator and journalist Harsha Bhogle said Nepal have a brighter future ahead of them.“Hold your heads high Nepal. That was South Africa you almost took down today. You have some of the most passionate fans and you let them believe. Hopefully bigger days are round the corner.”Indian Premier League franchise cricket team Chennai Super Kings wrote on X: “Unreal fans support! Unreal game of unreal night! Nepal, you have won all our hearts!”“Nepal's performance—all cricketing commentators, most of the IPL franchise teams, cricketing bodies are talking about the team, talking about that fan following!” a Nepal supporter based in Australia wrote on X. “Isn't it great? Didn't we win something?”ICC and Asian Cricket Council commentator Mikkhail Vaswani wrote on his Facebook page: “Nepal are the youngest team in this World Cup. They have put on some great performances. Time to back the boys for a very strong and committed effort.”At an average age of 23.7, Nepal are the youngest team at the World Cup. The team is led by Rohit Paudel, who, at 21, is the youngest captain in the 20-team tournament, while Gulsan Jha, 18, is the youngest player.After the match, Paudel stressed that Nepal needed more exposure against the best teams of the world if they are to be on the right side of the result.“We were very close but a little far,” Paudel said after the close contest. “In crunch moments, we did well, the way we fought was very good.”He added, “If we get more exposure regularly, then next games we will be on the other side [of the result].”Nepal were a far less experienced side as they were making their only second appearance at the world stage.Chasing, the batters took Nepal to 85-2 in the 14th over in the chase, riding on 32 runs from their power play without losing a wicket and a half-century stand between opener Aasif Sheikh and Anil Sah that came off just 36 deliveries.But the introduction of spinner Tabraiz Shamsi (4-19) would prove to be lethal in Nepal’s chase.Shamsi first dismissed Bhurtel for 13 with his only second delivery in the eighth over and Paudel for a duck two balls later to hurl South Africa back in the game.Sheikh and Sah rebuilt the Nepal innings.Sah hit three boundaries off Anrich Nortje and a six off Shamshi to raise the tempo before Sheikh smashed Kagiso Rabada for a four and a six that took Nepal past 80 total after 13 overs with still eight wickets in hand.After Sah fell to Aiden Markram (1-8) making 27 runs off 24 balls, Sheikh and Airee dragged Nepal to 98-3 from 17 overs.But Shamshi returned with the ball in the 18th over and mercilessly raided the stumps of Airee and dangerman Sheikh to turn the game back into South Africa’s favour. Sheikh finished his innings with 42 runs off 49 balls.Nepal needed 16 runs off the last 12 balls but Nortje (1-27) and Ottneil Baartman held their nerves in the final two overs to save the Proteas from the jaws of defeat.Nortje bowled four dots in the penultimate over including a wicket of Kushal Malla that left Nepal requiring 16 runs off the last eight balls.Sompal Kami hit Nortje with a long six and collected two runs off the last ball of the 19th over that brought the equation down to eight off the final six deliveries. Gulsan Jha next cracked a four off Baartman in the 19.3 overs and managed another two off the next delivery to inch Nepal closer to overhauling the target.Nepal only needed two runs off the last two deliveries to keep alive their hopes of reaching the Super Eight but Baartman threw two dots with perfect bouncers to break Nepali hearts.Gulsan Jha tried to take the game to Super Over with a desperate attempt to add a run off a bye of the final delivery but Quinton de Kock and Heinrich Klaasen combined to run him out at the non-striker’s end.Earlier, Bhurtel took 4-19 and Airee bowled 3-21 to trouble South Africa throughout the innings.South Africa added 22 runs for the first wicket before Airee got the breakthrough wicket when he caught and bowled de Kock for 10 in the fourth over.Bhurtel then bowled captain Markram for 15 in the 12th over, ending their 46-run stand for the second wicket.South Africa seemed headed for a good total when they were at 68-2 in the 12th over but Bhurtel’s wrist spin and Airee’s off break kept their powerful opponents under control.Bhurtel removed Klaasen for three before Airee got the big fish Hendricks, who top scored for South Africa with 43 runs off 49 balls, and removed David Miller for seven the next.South Africa needed sixth number batter Tristan Stubbs’s 27 not out off 18 balls for a boost to their innings.Bhurtel then underlined Nepal’s impressive bowling, claiming the wickets of Marco Jansen (1) and Rabada (0) in successive deliveries off the final two balls.Sandeep Lamichhane also started for the first time after missing Nepal’s matches in the United States due to visa issues and bowled splendidly conceding only 18 runs in his four-over spell.“I am very proud of the unit, especially the way we bowled and batted, I'm very proud of that,” Paudel said.South Africa skipper Markram was also full of praise for Nepal’s bowling.“First and foremost, the way [Nepal] bowled it made it really tough for us. They put us under a lot of pressure,” Markram said.The defeat leaves Nepal fourth in the five-team group D with one point, which they earned after rain washed out their second group match against Sri Lanka. Nepal had lost their opening game to the Netherlands by six wickets.South Africa, who had already progressed to the Super Eight round, finished the group stage unbeaten, collecting eight points from four matches.Nepal next face Bangladesh on Monday and will look to end their T20 World Cup campaign on a high note.Bangladesh are second with four points from three matches and a victory over Nepal would secure them a spot in the next round.The Netherlands, on two points, are also in contention and next face Sri Lanka who are also without a win and lie at the bottom of the group. \nThe process of enacting a separate air carriers’ liability and insurance legislation for domestic carriers has stalled yet again.On March 1, the Cabinet approved the tourism ministry’s proposal to prepare a draft bill on domestic air carriers’ liability and insurance.This was done years after Nepal adopted the Montreal Convention of 1999, which makes international airlines liable in case of death or injury to passengers. Nepal adopted the Montreal Convention of 1999 on December 15, 2018.The tourism ministry officials say that the process stalled this time after Buddhi Sagar Lamichhane, the chairman of the panel appointed to prepare the draft bill, was automatically suspended on April 5. This happened after the Commission for Investigation of Abuse of Authority filed a case against 32 individuals, including Lamichhane, at the Special Court over their alleged involvement in corruption in the April 2017 Airbus A330s deal.Mukesh Dangol, an official at the tourism ministry, said the ministry has appointed Indu Ghimire, its joint-secretary, to head the panel. “With this latest development, the process will now move ahead.”He said that after a round of consultation with the stakeholders, the draft will be sent to the finance and law ministries seeking their consent. “Following their nod, the draft will be tabled at the Cabinet before it is registered in Parliament.” The draft, however, is already ready. Officials expect the registration process to be completed in at least two months.The draft of the air carriers’ liability and insurance bill from domestic carriers, which proposes a five-fold increase in compensation for death or injury, has been in the making since Nepal ratified the Montreal Convention.The draft bill was extensively discussed with the stakeholders before it was finalised in 2020.However, successive tourism ministers failed to table the bill in Parliament. The draft bill was then kept on hold without much explanation.The long-delayed air carriers’ liability and insurance draft bill proposes a fivefold increase in compensation for death or injury.As per the planned law, domestic airlines have to pay a minimum compensation of $100,000 for the injury or death of a passenger. Currently, the minimum compensation for passenger death on a domestic flight is $20,000.Under the Montreal Convention of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), carriers have to pay 128,821 Special Drawing Rights (SDRs) or ($171,018) if the damage is due to the carrier’s negligence or a wrongful act or omission.SDRs are an interest-bearing international reserve asset used by the International Monetary Fund.Under the Montreal Convention 1999, in any crash, the victims’ families have the right to claim unlimited compensation if there is a wrongful death.The draft bill says that the carrier should make an advance payment when it is necessary to meet the immediate economic needs of passengers or the families of victims.According to the proposed law, a compensation claim should be filed with the airline or its agents within 60 days of the incident or accident. The carrier’s liability limitation for cargo lost, damaged or delayed shall be $20 per kg if the damage was caused or contributed to by the negligence of the carriers, it says.Under the Montreal Convention 1999, effective as of December 28, 2019, a carrier’s liability limitation for cargo lost, damaged or delayed shall be 22 SDRs per kg ($29.21 per kg) in the case of destruction, loss, damage or delay concerning cargo carriage.Similarly, carriers must pay 1,288 SDRs ($1,709.90) for each passenger in case of baggage destruction, loss, damage, or delay.Likewise, 5,346 SDRs ($7,097.16) should be compensated for each passenger in relation to damage caused by delay in the carriage of persons.The domestic carriers, however, have been objecting to a few clauses, such as the carrier’s liability for delays and unlimited compensation, which, according to them, is not practical in a country like Nepal.Airlines officials say that, given Nepal’s geographical terrain, climatic behaviour, and airport facilities, Nepali airlines cannot afford to be liable for delays.According to tourism ministry officials, the proposed legislation is a modified version of the Montreal Convention 1999 as there are several clauses that domestic airlines would not be able to comply with.Frequent ministerial changes have slowed it down, they say. Some ministers held their positions for long enough but were not bothered about pushing the bill.The bill could not be registered as Parliament was prorogued several times in the past.As a result of the delay, passengers who died in the Yeti Airlines plane crash in January 2023 missed out on compensation in millions of rupees.The Yeti Airlines tragedy in Pokhara was Nepal’s 104th crash and the third biggest in terms of casualties.According to Nepal’s civil aviation body, more than 900 people have died in air crashes in the country since the first disaster was recorded in August 1955.The biggest air accident took place on September 28, 1992, when an Airbus A310 belonging to Pakistan International Airlines slammed into a hillside at Bhattedanda near Kathmandu Valley, killing 167 people on board.Earlier, on July 31, 1992, an Airbus A310 of Thai Airways crashed in Ghyangphedi, killing 113 on board.Nepal’s domestic airlines—nine fixed-wing operators and 12 helicopters—flew 4.15 million passengers in 2023. \nSri Lanka’s rich culture, wealth of natural resources, and diversity of accessible experiences make it one of the world’s best holiday destinations. The most common sight across the island nation is the tank cascades system, an ancient irrigation infrastructure—a network of small tanks draining to large reservoirs that store rainwater and surface runoff for later use. Despite being cash-strapped and plunging into its worst financial crisis in more than seven decades in 2022, Sri Lanka is now bouncing back, thanks to the growing number of tourists. We spent five days in the island country two weeks ago, driving up and down the island, covering almost 70 percent of its territory. Following the trip spanning over 1,000 kilometres, including hills, beach spots, and heritage and religious sites, the Post presents a travel guide to Sri Lanka. \nEducation in Every Home’s report titled ‘Diversity, Equity and Inclusion in Nepal’s Textbooks’ highlights the lack of diversity, inclusivity, and inaccuracies in these textbooks.  The findings include egregious mistakes in textbooks like the inclusion of a letter Abraham Lincloln supposedly wrote—dating to a time 17 years after his assassination, to assertions like Brazil has tigers, elephants and rhinos while Germany has tigers and monkeys. The books display a clear bias in favour of Brahmin Chhetri males, while women make up just 18 percent of all people profiled. While 80 percent of all bylines are male, the presence of marginalised communities, especially Dalits, is nearly non-existent.  \n\nThe Araniko Project, which is also a popular blog, aims to uncover the past and present of the Nepal-China relations by using primary sources in Mandarin. A fluent Mandarin speaker, Rajbhandari, who has lived in Beijing for six years, has a master’s degree in Chinese politics from Renmin University of China.  In this conversation, she talks about Chinese historiography on Nepal, the nuances of Mandarin-to-English translation, Nepal-China ties and the importance of understanding Chinese language in order to understand the country. \nIt’s been 10 days since Upendra Yadav got reelected Janata Samajbadi Party-Nepal (JSP-Nepal) chair unopposed from the party’s general convention held in Janakpur.Nearly two weeks since the inauguration of the convention and the election of the party chairman, the JSP-Nepal, however, hasn’t elected any other office bearers and central committee members so far.Incumbent chief Yadav was declared the party chair unopposed after no one threw their hat in the ring.After Yadav’s reelection on June 12, the process to elect the office-bearers and central committee members, scheduled for June 13, was halted saying that all other leaders would be chosen in consensus.Before the party decided to halt the election process, 23 candidates—17 men and six women—had filed their candidacies for the five positions of vice chairpersons; six candidates were vying for two posts of general secretary. Twelve aspirants—nine men and three women—filed their candidacies for the three posts of deputy general secretary.Besides, three leaders were in the fray for a treasurer position; and 34 leaders had filed their candidacies for seven positions of secretary.To the question of whether the leaders had deferred the election finding it difficult to pick individuals for available positions, party insiders gave multiple answers.A leader linked the leadership election deferral to the party split in the first week of May.A group of JSP-Nepal leaders split the party and formed the Janata Samajbadi Party under the leadership of Ashok Rai. The Election Commission registered the new outfit on May 6.The JSP-Nepal led by Yadav on May 13 moved the Supreme Court, accusing the commission of recognising its splinter group as a party without the legal basis.Yadav, in his petition, claimed that the commission had registered the party even without the required 40 percent central members on its side. The top court has ordered the relevant authorities to stall the process until the verdict and the case is still sub judice.The uncertainty prevents the newly formed Rai-led party from expediting its activities in a formal way. Seven of the 12 JSP-Nepal lawmakers in the federal parliament and 30 of the 406 party central committee members are with Rai.The new outfit’s plan to build its organisation at the provincial and local levels is in limbo due to the delayed court process. Leaders from the new party claimed that a large number of leaders and cadres are waiting to join the new organisation. Moreover, they are planning to embrace those aspirants of top positions when they are denied posts in central bodies. Observers of Madhesh politics claimed that the JSP-Nepal was unable to complete its election process with the splinter faction eying to lure its members. However, Manish Kumar Suman, one of the aspirants for general secretary in the JSP-Nepal, denied it. He claimed that the stalled general convention process, including the selection of leaders for office bearers positions, would be completed within a week.“As per the election commission deadline, we have to complete the whole general convention process within 35 days,” Suman told the Post. “We will complete the process before the timeframe.”Some political observers say the JSP-Nepal went for the general convention only out of the constitutional compulsion. If the party really wanted to follow the democratic process, it should have allowed the election process to go forward.Article 269 (4) (B) of the constitution mandates the political parties to hold the general convention at least once in five years.“Upendra Yadav has made himself the JSP-Nepal patron,” Shiva Chandra Chaudhary, a Madhesh political observer, told the Post. “He can select leaders loyal to him, having been reelected the party chairman. So he stalled the democratic process.”On the other hand, the new outfit—Janata Samajbadi Party—too has failed to give momentum to the party building process in the six weeks since its inception.The new outfit has gained prominence apparently with the support of the ruling coalition. The Election Commission swiftly registered the new party on May 6 with the name similar to the mother party despite legal ambiguities in the process. The JSP joined the ruling coalition immediately after its formation and supported the Pushpa Kamal Dahal-led government. The Rai-led party has been given a Cabinet minister and a state minister. On Saturday, when the Cabinet made recommendations for ambassadors to eight countries, two nominations went to the new outfit’s supporters. Ambassadors for Saudi Arabia and Spain were appointed in the JSP quotas. Days after the JSP-Nepal withdrew its support to the government, the Rai-led JSP gave its trust vote to Dahal and it supported the government in its policies and programmes.Lawmaker Sushila Shrestha of the JSP tried to downplay the difficulties saying that they were carrying out the party’s activities quietly. “We are engaged in several activities to strengthen the newly formed party, but we are not visible in the media,” Shrestha claimed. “Next Saturday and Sunday, our party’s central committee is meeting.” Shrestha claimed that her party is stronger than the JSP-Nepal in the provinces except for Madhesh. “We have been holding the meetings of provincial committees and are working to make our presence felt in Madhesh Province too.”Though Shrestha claims there are a number of activities within the party, political observers believe that its activities are stagnant due to the case sub judice in the court. “A writ petition in the Supreme Court related to the party split has stalled the new party formation,” Tula Narayan Shah, a political analyst, told the Post.Yadav has claimed the commission registered the party despite its failure to fulfil the required 40 percent support of central members for a party split. JSP-Nepal had 406 central committee members at the time of the party split, but the splinter group only had 30 central members with it.The newly formed JSP was registered amid a legal void as the Political Parties Act 2017 was replaced by an ordinance but not revived afterwards. According to the Act, a group of dissidents can split a party and form a new one if they can prove the support of at least 40 percent of the central committee members and at least 40 percent of the party’s lawmakers.However, this provision was nullified through an ordinance three years ago, leaving no legal basis for a party split. On June 9, the Supreme Court referred the dispute related to the party to the full bench. \nProtests by employees at the Parliament Secretariat have affected deliberations on the national budget.On Wednesday, eight ministers were scheduled to answer lawmakers’ concerns about the budget for the fiscal year 2024-25 at the House of Representatives. However, the meeting had to be adjourned even before one minister completed his reply due to the employees' non-cooperation.The episode replayed on Thursday. Though seven ministers were scheduled to answer lawmakers' concerns, only four could respond. United under the Employee Union of the Federal Parliament Secretariat, the officials have been staging a series of protests. Starting Wednesday, they stopped working beyond office hours demanding allowances for overtime and odd hours.The agitators say they will not work before and after office hours until they are paid allowances. Office hours start at 10 am and end at 5 pm.“We will not be working extra hours without additional payment,” Govinda Belbase, chairperson of the union, told the Post. “Our non-cooperation continues.”As the protest started to affect House proceedings, Speaker Devraj Ghimire, together with Narayan Dahal, chairperson of the National Assembly, held discussions with Barsha Man Pun, the finance minister, on Thursday to address the demands. However, Pun did not respond positively.Shekhar Adhikari, Ghimire's press advisor, said the Speaker has taken the staff's non-cooperation seriously as it has hampered the House business. The Speaker has also raised the issue with Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal and Minister for Law, Justice and Parliamentary Affairs Padam Giri, but to no avail.Even before the formulation of the national budget, the Parliament staff had drawn the attention of Ghimire, Dahal, and Padma Prasad Panday, the general secretary at the Parliament Secretariat. Ghimire had requested Pun to increase Parliament’s budget and resume the allowances for extra work his staff performed.However, the money was not allocated in the national budget presented in Parliament on May 28, prompting the protest.Ekram Giri, spokesperson for the secretariat, said the protest has hit the House calendar. \"The deliberations in the budget are not moving as planned,\" Giri told the Post, adding that the discussions between the Speaker and the government have not yielded positive results. Parliament has less than three weeks to complete the deliberations on the budget and get it endorsed from both houses, Giri said. All the budget-related bills need to be authenticated by the President before mid-July. The new fiscal year starts on July 16.The budget-related bills are scheduled to be endorsed by the lower house on June 27, but that doesn't look possible following the protests.On normal days, meetings of the House committees were held in the morning while parliamentary meetings were conducted after 11 am. As the parliament staff have stopped working in the morning, no committee meetings have been held in the morning for days now.Parliament Secretariat staff claim that they have to work regularly before and after office hours without being paid a penny beyond their regular salary, while lawmakers get travel and meeting allowances, in addition to their salary, for attending the House and parliamentary committee meetings.Belbase said it has been three years since the government stopped paying the allowance.Belbase said that the House meetings, which generally start at 11 am, run beyond 5 pm regularly. The staff must arrive at least an hour before the meeting for preparations and stay an additional hour after the meeting.Protestors say they had been working over 10 hours a day for months without additional payment.It was an injustice to them and against the ILO Convention of 1930, to which Nepal is a party, they say.Article 3 of the Convention states, “The hours of work of persons to whom this Convention applies shall not exceed forty-eight hours in the week and eight hours in the day, except as hereinafter otherwise provided.”The allowance for government staff was withdrawn following the Covid-19 pandemic. The government resumed the allowance in some state agencies, including the Election Commission and the Commission for the Investigation of Abuse of Authority, but not in Parliament, said Belbase.“We are not going to compromise this time,” Belbase said. “This is a fight for justice.” \nFormer President Bhandari's renewal of party membership raises questions on the ethics of returning to active politics after receiving state benefits, with no clear constitutional guidance or policies on perks for ex-presidents.\nPrime Minister Dahal's question-answer session in parliament reveals dissatisfaction over low attendance, discusses India visit, recalls ambassadors, and addresses cooperative issues.\nCPN (Unified Socialist) gears up for general convention with top leaders lobbying for leadership positions, including former PMs Nepal and Khanal, as the party faces dwindling influence and struggles to retain members.\nA police officer committed suicide by shooting himself in the washroom of the federal parliament building in Kathmandu on Wednesday.\nPolice in Nepal arrest two individuals in connection with alleged cryptocurrency mining operations using a server and desktops at an information technology lab.\nThe Central Investigation Bureau has arrested three individuals on charges of embezzlement of over Rs74 million of the Kathmandu-based Square Savings and Credit Cooperative.Those arrested include cooperative chair Basudev Man Joshi, 66, of Kathmandu Metropolitan City-14; secretary Subarna Selalik, 67, of Kathmandu-25; and member Dharma Ratna Pachhai, 58, of Kathmandu-26.Superintendent of Police Hobindra Bogati, who is also the spokesperson for the CIB, said they were arrested on Friday. On Sunday, Kathmandu District Court remanded them for a week for further investigation.According to him, the cooperative operators have been accused of luring depositors with the promise of attractive interest rates but failing to return their deposits. \nDays after Kathmandu Mayor Balendra Shah joined the Nepali Congress in accusing CPN-UML chair KP Sharma Oli in a multi-billion-rupee failed land swap bid in Jhapa, lawmakers from the main opposition have backed Shah in his initiative to expand the sidewalks at New Road—something the UML opposes.Speaking in the House of Representatives on Thursday, Congress General Secretary Bishwo Prakash Sharma backed the mayor's plan to expand pedestrian lanes at New Road that clashed with the vision of the Road Division, led by a UML minister, to widen the roads instead. Lawmaker Sharma said that in case of conflict between a central agency and a local unit, the federal government should show more restraint than the local government.“Mayor Balendra Shah’s initiative to widen pavements at New Road is the right step for the general public’s convenience,” Sharma told the House. “Mayor Shah should be allowed to continue his work without any interference as what he is doing is absolutely right.”The conflict escalated when the Road Division, under the federal government, intervened and paved the road cut by the metropolis on Monday. The metropolis had cleared stretches a few metres wide on either side of the road to create space for pavements. The dispute resulted in a standoff between those deployed by the Road Division and the Kathmandu municipal staff, with different people taking different sides. The tension eased without any untoward incident as the metropolis backed off after the federal government deployed police at the site.The Road Division, under the Ministry of Physical Infrastructure and Transport, is led by Deputy Prime Minister Raghubir Mahaseth, who is a UML secretary. The dispute grew to involve those supporting Mayor Shah and the UML, the biggest partner in the Pushpa Kamal Dahal-led coalition, and also spilled over to social media.In Parliament, lawmakers from the main opposition Nepali Congress threw their weight behind Shah.Not only the party’s general secretary Sharma, two other lawmakers from the party also expressed their support for the mayor in the House meeting on Thursday. Congress lawmaker Arjun Narsingh KC said the conflict between the federal government and the Kathmandu mayor has raised serious questions about the federal government’s intent. KC stressed that cooperation and collaboration between the federal, provincial, and local governments is essential in avoiding conflict and resolving disputes between the three federal units. He said Articles 232 and 235 of the constitution and related schedules clearly define their jurisdictions.“The recent conflict between the federal and local governments and the saga of making and breaking of a road section have raised serious questions,” KC said. He urged the government not to resort to violence and to resolve the issue in a rational way.Another Congress lawmaker, Kanti Sejuwal, also speaking in the zero hour of Parliament, questioned the government for clashing with the municipal authority. “Either we should scrap the Local Government Operation Act 2017, or the federal government should let Balendra work.”As the Road Division intervened in Mayor Shah’s plan to widen the pavement in the New Road area, Sejuwal had expressed his anger at UML chair Oli.Following the federal agency’s intervention, the mayor wrote on social media, alleging Oli’s involvement in the attempted illegal swapping of land at the Birtamode-based Giri Bandhu Tea Estate worth billions of rupees. The largest party, the Congress, had been accusing the UML chief of being complicit in the land swap issue.A few days ago, Shah also engaged in a heated exchange with the KMC’s Ward 22 chairman Chinkaji Maharjan, a UML member, over the sidewalk expansion. Even before that, municipal staff dumped a truckload of dirt and trash outside the Kathmandu Road Division office, claiming that the delayed road expansion work from Kalanki to Maharajgunj had inconvenienced the public.Earlier, on May 14, the Congress parliamentary party meeting had decided to raise the issue of the tea estate land in Parliament. The Oli government, formed after the 2017 general elections, allowed the owners of the tea estate to swap 343.19 bighas (232.43 hectares) of land it occupied, based on a revision to the Land Act (1964). The Act was revised in January 2020, under the Oli administration, introducing a provision for allowing a swap or selling of land to pay off the tea estate’s liabilities if it went into liquidation. Asked if the Congress had backed the mayor as he alleged the UML chair Oli’s involvement in the Tea Estate land scam, the Congress publicity department head Min Bahadur Bishwokarma denied it. “Party lawmakers including the general secretary must have backed the mayor as the New Road sidewalk issue is of public concern, and not necessarily because it involves the UML,” Bishwokarma said. \nDead bodies of a man and a woman were found on a cliff in Dakshinkali Municipality-8, located on the southern outskirts of Kathmandu.According to the Kathmandu Valley Police Office, the bodies were spotted approximately 200 metres down the hill from the Kathmandu-Dakshinkali road.Senior Superintendent of Police Dinesh Raj Mainali said that the preliminary investigation suggests they died in an accident, as a crashed motorcycle was found near the bodies.Mainali said a disaster management team of Nepal Police is working to retrieve the bodies from the hill. He said locals informed the police after spotting the bodies on Wednesday evening.The police said the deceased woman is a 32-year-old resident of Changunarayan Municipality-5, while the man is yet to be identified. \nPrivate dairies have requested subsidised loans from the government to settle farmers' dues, amounting to nearly Rs3 billion, amid the ongoing dairy sector slump.They have also requested the government to permit them to export dairy products such as powdered milk, butter, and cheese, as consumption within the country has remained subdued. As a result, the stock has been piling up. Recently, the government partially bailed out the state-owned Dairy Development Corporation by providing Rs300 million in soft loans. After dairy farmers started protests, officials privy to the matter told the Post that the government is preparing to release another Rs600 million to the corporation. The corporation had in February said that the dairy industry was suffering from a recession and hoped that sales would increase in summer. But it didn’t.Both state-owned and private dairy companies said that the ongoing economic slowdown has dampened dairy demand, resulting in stopped cash flow and rising liabilities to farmers as products remained unsold for months.“We are unable to pay farmers due to unsold products. The stock, too, is huge,” said Prahlad Dahal, president of the Nepal Dairy Association.“So we have requested the Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock Development to provide a soft loan keeping our dairy products as collateral. We have also requested the government to open up exports so that we can sell our products and become able to pay the farmers.” The association is scheduled to meet the agriculture minister on Monday. “We hope that our request will be heeded,” said Dahal. The association has requested a soft loan for more than 50 percent of its remaining stock. Private dairies have stocks of powdered milk and butter worth Rs5 billion, said Dahal.According to the association, the committee formed by the agriculture ministry to study the payment issues of dairy farmers found that around Rs4.50 billion is due to be paid by dairies to the farmers. The amount was previously Rs7 billion.This shows that payment is being made gradually, Dahal said. “But that is not sufficient.”Consumer demand for milk and other dairy-related products declined last year, with the government hiking the price of raw milk to benefit and encourage more dairy farmers to join the sector. However, the unscientific hike hit demand amid the people's declining incomes due to the economic slowdown.Regarding price reduction to increase consumption, Dahal said private diaries have a high cost of production, so it will not be possible to reduce the price.The government also imposes VAT on dairy products like ghee, ice cream, and cheese. “If the VAT is waived, prices will come down, which can boost the sales,” said Dahal.According to the association, nearly 1 million litres of milk comes from the formal sector, which implies a daily transaction of Rs70 million.“If the soft loan is provided and export is permitted, we will be able to clear all the farmers' dues by September,” Dahal said.Dairy entrepreneurs said that the butter stock is gradually being cleared, and milk production has declined, balancing stock and output.Last Wednesday, dairy farmers demonstrated outside the Lainchaur-based Dairy Development Corporation, demanding immediate settlement of their outstanding payments. Police arrested dozens of dairy farmers during the protest.Around 50 farmers were arrested as they attempted to picket the corporation. According to the association, 600,000 families are associated with the dairy sector, contributing 45,000 jobs. More than Rs60 million cash flows from urban to rural areas daily, and the government collects revenue of more than Rs2 billion monthly.“The agriculture ministry has called us for a meeting on Monday,” said Amar Bahadur Kunwar, president of the Central Dairy Cooperatives Association. “Both private and government dairy industries have more than Rs5 billion in dues to be paid to dairy farmers.”Dahal said the state-owned corporation alone has outstanding dues of Rs2 billion to the dairy farmers.The corporation even issued a public notice on June 10 inviting bids to sell its butter and powdered milk. As per the notice, it planned to sell 200 tonnes of butter (15kg block) and 300 tonnes of skimmed powdered milk (25kg bag).In another notice on Sunday, the corporation fixed the skimmed powdered milk rates. The country currently produces more than 6 million litres of milk daily. The corporation purchases around 25 percent of it. \nIn Nepal, the festivals measure the economy. Last Dashain, the cash crunch forced consumers to trim purchases.After a year, the situation seems unimproved.“We are not in the mood to place orders for goods for upcoming festivities,” said Ram Hari Karki, president of Nepal Trans Himalayan Border Commerce Association. “There is no demand at all. It looks like a deep economic slowdown.”Usually, traders place orders for foreign goods, particularly apparel, three months before the start of Nepal’s key festival season. Even though traders bring some amount of goods, it may be costlier. Due to the appreciation of the US dollar and increased customs duties, the prices of goods and commodities may rise, causing difficulties for many ordinary Nepalis.“Goods are becoming costlier day by day. That is why traders are cautious this year about placing orders,” said Karki. “The demand for festivities has not returned to the pre-pandemic level.”There are no statistics about consumption during the Dashain, Tihar, and Chhath festivals, but analysts say it grows manifold compared to the normal time. Kumar Karki, president of the Nepal National Traders’ Federation, said due to subdued demand, they may see a business decline by 15–20 percent. In comparison, prices may rise by 20 percent in the upcoming festivals.Even during the summer, traders say the market has slowed down.“Despite the rising heat, the demand for summer garments and shoes has not picked up,” said a trader in New Road, the country’s central shopping hub. “The footfall of shoppers has declined compared to last year’s season, reflecting the decline in people’s incomes.”“Nowadays, only a handful of traders are planning their trip to China to order goods. We don’t see demand recovering from last year’s drop,” said Kumar Karki.Some traders say there is a shift in the trade.In the past years, China fulfilled 80 percent of Nepal’s need for readymade garments.However, according to three top traders who spoke to the Post, the market seems flooded with Indian goods, which are relatively cheaper.Currently, traders said, an average of 15–20 loaded trucks are entering from Kerung and Tatopani customs points to the north, carrying garments, shoes and slippers, raincoats, and umbrellas, among other items. Before the Covid pandemic, 50–60 loaded trucks used to enter Nepal from the Chinese border at this time of the year.Cost is the key factor in subdued demand.On Friday, the Nepali rupee plunged to an all-time low of Rs134.15 against the dollar. A strong US dollar has advantages and disadvantages. It has negative impacts on an import-based economy like Nepal.“While importing goods, we must pay 30 to 40 percent as customs duty. The high customs duty has made imported goods expensive,” said Kumar Karki. The government needed to ease customs through the coming fiscal year's budget and further tighten it, he said. Importing goods through legal channels is becoming more difficult day by day, especially at the customs, and this has encouraged the illegal import of goods. This has resulted in an import decline.According to the central bank's macroeconomic report, the inflation rate on non-food and services remained at 2.96 percent in mid-May this year, compared to 8.89 percent a year ago. The year-on-year price index of clothes and footwear remained at 3.46 percent.Market analysts, however, say that data presents different facts than the actual market scenario. Economists say that youth are the significant spenders, and demand has declined in sectors like education and restaurants, including consumption of goods and services, as many youths have migrated abroad to study and work.Economist Nara Bahadur Thapa said that import-related activities used to increase by 30 percent with the start of a new fiscal year compared to other months before Covid. However, the number of traders importing goods by opening Letters of Credit (LC) has declined in recent years.“From July to October, imports used to spike and cross Rs200 billion per month, but now, even with the rise in foreign exchange rate, it hardly crosses Rs150 billion. This shows that the demand has declined as a result of economic slowdown,” Thapa said.Thapa said that as people's purchasing power has declined, the demand for different goods in major festival times has declined. The salaries of government and private sector employees have not increased in the past few years. “People are not going to spend unless they have money in their hands.”According to the Department of Customs, Nepal’s imports declined by 1.84 percent to Rs1.45 trillion in the first eleven months of the current fiscal year, which ended in mid-June, compared to the same period last fiscal year.The country’s imports slipped 16.08 percent to Rs1.61 trillion in the last fiscal year. \n\nNineteen-year-old Ekta suffers from excruciating pain during her periods. It is far beyond the usual pain and cannot be managed with medication–she’s tried that multiple times. Taking one dose of Meftal (a period pain medication) is never enough. The pain is debilitating most of the time.Despite several visits to gynaecologists, her complaints have been brushed aside as normal period pains. She strongly feels that her pain is abnormal, but feels powerless to address her issues.“The pain is so bad, but I cannot do anything about it,” she says. “I can’t count the number of times that I’ve been told that my debilitating pain is normal,” bemoans Ekta, whose name has been changed to protect her privacy.The normalisation of period pains means serious reproductive conditions like endometriosis often go untreated. People with endometriosis experience severe pelvic pain because tissues like that found outside the uterus grow inside it. Other symptoms of the condition include heavy bleeding during and between periods and fatigue. There is no known cure for this condition, and symptoms can start from the first period onwards.A major challenge experienced by women with endometriosis is the disregard of their symptoms by the public and medical professionals alike. Due to lack of awareness about the debilitating pain typical to endometriosis, both the person suffering from the condition, and their doctors often underestimate their severity.Severe pelvic pain is a key indicator for diagnosing endometriosis, says Dr Reena Shrestha, a gynaecologist at Madhyapur Hospital. When patients seek consultation regarding the kind of severe pain that significantly disrupts their lives, they may undergo two types of tests: transvaginal ultrasound and diagnostic laparoscopy. These procedures are used to determine the presence of endometriosis. Endometriosis is a complex condition, says Dr Hema Pradhan, a consultant gynaecologist at Everest Hospital. Amongst all the patients she meets at her consultations, many frequently turn out to have endometriosis. But, she’s noticed that often patients often delay seeking treatment because period pains are often normalised.“Women who come to me with their symptoms often delay seeking treatment, because, regardless of the severity of their pain, they believe all period pains to be normal,” says Pradhan.Eighteen-year-old Rima (name change) has been struggling with excessive pain before and during periods for years. She also experiences pain while urinating during her periods. Rima has also been diagnosed with Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome (PCOS). The co-occurence of PCOS and endometriosis is not unheard of, although research on them has been minimal.“I can barely walk when I’m on my periods, but I’ve always been told that I should just learn to live with it,” she says.Despite knowing about PCOS, she discovered the possibility of having endometriosis quite later in life. She shares this because period pain, even excessive ones, have been normalised for far too long.The general lack of awareness of endometriosis, and widespread normalisation of period pains, often results in late diagnosis and treatment of the condition.Although there may be no cure to the condition, there are ways to manage its most severe symptoms. Furthermore, receiving a diagnosis can greatly help patients to understand the severity of their condition, according to doctors. “I’m incapable of doing anything during my periods. One time I had to leave the examination in the middle of my exams because of the pain,” says Ekta. “I can’t study, can’t work, all I can do is stay in bed and cry,” she adds.Dr Pradhan reveals another challenging aspect of diagnosing endometriosis. Sometimes the condition may not appear on ultrasound scans initially. Endometrial deposits may appear differently in women due to hormonal changes. Furthermore, symptoms may vary, with some being asymptomatic altogether. According to Dr Shrestha, once a gynaecologist confirms that the patient has endometriosis, they will certainly recommend methods to manage the pain. These include analgesics for pain relief, and home remedies like hot water bag massage.However, the main problem remains. Due to lack of awareness, most patients may only find out about their condition later in life.In some cases women only discover they have endometriosis when they face infertility. Endometriosis is associated with infertility, and 30-50% of people with endometriosis may experience infertility. This also exposes another troubling aspect associated with endometriosis. Ekta shares that her relatives often express concerns about her potential infertility.“They just make me feel bad that I might never get pregnant. And it makes me feel worse,” Ekta adds.Worldwide, endometriosis has been known as a scientifically under-researched condition. It has even been called the ‘missed disease’ because of inconsistencies in its diagnosis and treatment. Endometriosis has also been widely ignored by policy makers.Treatment for endometriosis depends on the individual, says Dr Pradhan. Some are treated with hormonal medication, and others require surgical procedures. The main way to combat endometriosis is timely diagnosis, and timely treatment, she adds.“Raising awareness, timely diagnosis, and treatment are very important,” Dr Pradhan says. \nLast month, a local from Sindhupalchowk district was brought to Sukraraj Tropical and Infectious Disease Hospital to treat a snakebite. Along with the victim, relatives brought the live snake in a bottle to show the doctor as proof.“The snake was a king cobra,” said Dr Yuba Nidhi Basaula, director at the Hospital. “Fortunately, the venom had not penetrated deep into the victim’s body, and after three days of treatment, the victim was discharged. We called a snake handler and handed over the king cobra.”Sindhupalchowk is a mountain district where venomous snakes were thought of as non-existent. However, incidents of king cobra bites in mountain districts like Sindhupalchowk suggest that venomous snakes have started migrating towards hill and mountain districts, and rising temperatures caused by climate change are the main culprit, experts say.Nepal is among the world’s most vulnerable countries to the climate crisis and has witnessed multiple extreme weather events over the past decade and a half.Evidence suggests that maximum temperatures in Nepal are rising at a faster rate of 0.056 degrees Celsius a year, compared to the global average rise of 0.03 degrees Celsius a year. Compared to districts of the Tarai region, those in hills and mountains have been witnessing a more rapid increase in daytime maximum temperatures, which could have helped venomous snakes survive there, experts say.“Not only in Sindhupalchowk, but a king cobra bite was also spotted in Godawari of Lalitpur district last year,” said Basaula. “Snakebite cases have started rising alarmingly of late.”Of the 31 patients admitted to the hospital on Sunday, 16—more than 50 percent—were snakebite cases. Doctors at the hospital say eight to ten snakebite victims seek treatment there every day, and most victims seeking care at the hospital are from the districts of Kathmandu Valley or from those adjoining the Valley.Each year, around 2,700 people, mostly children and women from Nepal’s Tarai region, die of snakebites, according to a March 2022 report published in The Lancet, a leading international medical journal.However, snakebite cases are vastly underreported in the country. The Ministry of Health and Population said that only 14 deaths and 1,220 cases of snakebites had been reported in 11 months of the current fiscal year. Officials admit that venomous snakebite incidents are being reported from hill and mountain districts, and the demand for anti-snake venom is on the rise. They attribute this rise in snakebite incidents to rising temperatures. “Health facilities in some mountainous and hilly districts—like Darchula and Bajura—have asked for anti-snake venom,” said Dr Hemanta Chandra Ojha, an official at the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division. “Snakebite incidents have been on the rise,” said Dr Hemanta Chandra Ojha, an official at the division. “With the onset of the monsoon, people living in the risk areas should remain vigilant.”Every year, the Health Ministry purchases around 25,000 vials of anti-snake venom and distributes them to around 100 snakebite treatment centres in the country.Officials say as snakebite cases surge, so will the demand for additional treatment centres. “This year, we are planning to set up an additional 15 snakebite treatment centres,” said Ojha. Public health experts have urged authorities to launch an awareness drive about the risks. They say people living in thatched-roof houses are particularly vulnerable to snakebites, as snakes often enter such homes in search of rats. They say people should be asked to keep their homes and surroundings clean, prevent children from playing in bushy areas, avoid venturing out at night, and use torchlights while walking in the dark.Likewise, women and children who have to work in fields and go to the jungle are at the highest risk of snakebites. Small children are at risk of dying from snakebites, as they do not tell their parents about the bites on time due to fear of getting scolded for playing in the bushes, according to doctors.“We should make people aware so that they seek medical attention immediately after a snakebite, using whatever means of transport they get,” said Ojha. “The faster you reach the hospital, the greater your chances of survival.” \nA 45-year-old woman from Dhapasi, Kathmandu was diagnosed with high blood pressure, high cholesterol and diabetes some six months ago. Doctors at the National Cardiac Center, who attended to the patient prescribed medicines and advised her to change her lifestyle and eating habits to control the ailments.“The patient, who was worried about her health conditions, took the doctors’ advice seriously and joined a yoga class in the morning, made a drastic change in her eating habits, and engaged in physical activities,” said Dr Om Murti Anil, a senior cardiologist. “Her blood pressure, blood sugar and cholesterol levels are now under control, and she has also reduced her weight. Now, she doesn't need the high dose of medicines like in the past. ”This was a common refrain among a few patients, who took doctors' advice seriously, changed their lifestyles and eating habits, joined yoga classes, and increased physical activity, which helped them control high blood pressure, blood sugar and cholesterol levels.Public health experts say changing eating habits, lessening body weight, and starting physical activities, including yoga and physical exercises, help control non-communicable diseases, which have emerged as a major public health problem in Nepal.Studies show that non-communicable diseases have emerged as a serious public health issue in Nepal, accounting for around 80 percent of total deaths. A 2019 study by the Nepal Health Research Council on the prevalence of noncommunicable diseases found that they accounted for 71 percent of the deaths in the country. The study primarily focused on behavioural risk factors—tobacco and alcohol consumption—and biological risk factors—raised blood pressure, overweight, obesity, abnormal lipid prevalence, coronary artery disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and diabetes. The findings showed that the leading risk factor for death in 2019 was smoking, accounting for 17.7 percent deaths, followed by high systolic blood pressure at 12.3 percent, household air pollution at 11.2 percent, ambient air pollution at 9.3 percent, diabetes at 8 percent, as well as high cholesterol, kidney dysfunction.Additionally, around 8 percent of the deaths were attributed to accidents, including road traffic accidents.“For many patients, doctors have to increase the doses of medicines, as every time they come for follow-up, their reports often get worse,” said Anil. “To reduce weight, change lifestyle and eating habits, strong commitments are needed, and very few people have such determination.”Many patients, despite knowing that they are at high risk of dying due to inactivity, do not change their lifestyle or start physical activity. Doctors warn that non-communicable diseases—hypertension, heart disease, stroke and diabetes, among others—could lead to a public health crisis if not addressed immediately. They blame a sedentary lifestyle and the consumption of processed foods as chief culprits for the growing burden of non-communicable diseases and obesity.They warn that people from all walks of life have been affected by the repercussions of changing lifestyles and food habits. Entire family members suffer if any member, particularly the breadwinner, faces serious health problems.Experts say continuous awareness campaigns about the rising prevalence of non-communicable diseases, the promotion of healthy lifestyles, and the start of yoga classes in community centres, schools, and open-air gyms could help lessen the growing burden of non-communicable diseases. “Physical exercises not only help in managing the disease conditions but also lessen the risk of developing non-communicable diseases,” said Dr Munkarna Thapa, information officer at the Department of Ayurveda and Alternative Medicine. “Along with physical fitness, they contribute to the mental well-being of people.”Meanwhile, department officials said that they have allocated a budget to promote open-air fitness centres, yoga classes, and alternatives, keeping in mind the growing burden of non-communicable diseases in society.Open-air gyms have been set up in public places, and the public can use them free of charge. Apart from setting up outdoor gyms, imparting training to communities and school students and promoting healthy lifestyles to reduce the major risk factors associated with non-communicable diseases, Thapa said.The department, which has already set up open-air fitness centres at the headquarters of all seven provinces, plans to set up 10 more such centres in the upcoming fiscal year. Several local units also have set up such facilities in their areas. \nIn a bid to address the problem of malnutrition in children under five, the Ministry of Health and Population has started imparting training to nurses and paramedics serving in Lumbini, Karnali, and Sudurpaschim provinces.Officials hope that a week-long training programme will help lessen the existing problems of malnutrition in those provinces.“Imparting training to combat malnutrition in small children is our nationwide programme, which we have started from Lumbini, Karnali and Sudurpaschim provinces,” said Lila Bikram Thapa, chief of Nutrition Section at the Family Welfare Division under the Department of Health Services. “Along with imparting training to health workers, we will also launch an awareness drive to improve exclusive breastfeeding practices.”Malnutrition is considered a silent health crisis in Nepal. The country has made significant progress in reducing stunting among children under five, which decreased from 57 percent in 2001 to 25 percent in 2022, according to the Nepal Demographic and Health Survey-2022.The report showed some improvement in the country’s overall nutrition status, but progress is not the same in all provinces.More than 16 percent of the children under five years in Lumbini Province are found to be suffering from wasting—the most immediate, visible, and life-threatening form of malnutrition.Wasting, a debilitating disease that causes muscle and fat tissues to waste away among children under five, decreased from 11 percent in 2001 to eight percent in 2022.Wasting or low weight for one’s height in children, if not treated properly and on time, is associated with a higher mortality risk, according to the World Health Organisation.The report shows that exclusive breastfeeding has been continuously declining, from 70 percent in 2011 to 56 percent last year. Health officials said that studies show that more educated and well-off mothers are less likely to exclusively breastfeed their babies.According to the report, the proportion of children who are bottle-fed rises with increasing mothers’ education, from 12 percent among those whose mothers have no education to 49 percent among those whose mothers have more than a secondary education. Use of a bottle with a nipple is the highest in the highest wealth quintile at 46 percent and lowest in the lowest quintile at 11 percent.Likewise, the proportion of children who are bottle-fed is higher in urban areas, 26 percent, than in rural areas, 15 percent. The use of a bottle with a nipple is lowest in Karnali Province at 11 percent, in Madhesh Province at 12 percent, and the highest in Bagmati Province at 43 percent.Exclusive breastfeeding is the highest in Sudurpaschim and Karnali provinces—74 percent each—and the lowest in Lumbini Province—36 percent.“We have allocated the nutrition budget to launch a nationwide awareness drive about the importance of exclusive breastfeeding in the upcoming fiscal year,” said Thapa. “We have also designated a nutrition focal person at every local unit who is tasked to discourage practices of promoting replacement feeding.”The report also showed that bottle-feeding practices started in health facilities. It showed that 22 percent of children born in a health facility receive mixed milk feeding (breast milk and fresh, packaged, or powdered animal milk or infant formula), as compared with 12 percent of those born at home. Bottle feeding is not recommended, as the nipple on a feeding bottle is susceptible to contamination and increases the risk of diseases among children, according to the World Health Organisation.Health ministry officials hoped that training for nurses and paramedics would help lessen bottle-feeding practices in health facilities.Doctors say breastfeeding should continue for the first two years or beyond, as breast milk lowers children’s risk of illness, promotes their recovery during illness, and remains an important source of nutrients for healthy growth and development.According to them, longer durations of breastfeeding have many health benefits for women, including reduced risks of certain breast and ovarian cancers and diabetes.Nepal had committed to increasing the exclusive breastfeeding rate to more than 90 percent by 2030, but the rate declined from 70 percent in 2011 to 66 percent in 2016 and to 56 percent in 2022. \nIn a world where acceptance and safety often seem difficult to attain, many queer individuals also struggle to find a safe space to express themselves. They have to hide their true self and face relentless judgement when going to public places like cafes and restaurants.This is the reality for countless LGBTQIA+ individuals. The need for a safe space for this community is not just a desire but a necessity—a space where one can be themselves. This struggle for safety and acceptance can be traced to crucial historical moments, such as the Stonewall Riots of 1969 in New York City.The Stonewall Inn was more than a bar; it was a refuge for the queer community. When police raided the bar, the community fought back. This series of violent confrontations, which began in the early hours of June 28, 1969, between police and gay rights activists, marked the beginning of the modern LGBTQIA+ rights movement. The spirit of Stonewall, the fight for dignity and the right to exist openly lives on in places like Inclusive Galaxy Restaurant in Kathmandu. Inclusive Galaxy beyond a restaurant is an ‘oasis’ for the queer community and beyond.Founded by Bishwaraj Adhikari, Mr Gay Handsome Nepal 2013, a human rights defender, the restaurant proves the power of safe spaces. It’s a place where the community can unite, free from the prejudice and hostility that often permeate their everyday lives.After years of working in the human rights sector, Adhikari and his partner developed the idea for Inclusive Galaxy. What began as a small cafe gradually evolved into a full-fledged restaurant, driven by the growing demand and support from the community.“In developed countries with strong LGBTQIA+ movements, you can find community areas like gay villages. These are created as safe spaces for people whose families and communities have excluded them. They also support new business ideas and pink tourism. I hope to see pink tourism develop in Nepal someday,” says Adhikari. His vision for Inclusive Galaxy goes beyond just being a restaurant. He aims to promote financial independence and empowerment within the queer community.Since its inception in February 2019, Inclusive Galaxy has become a key spot for many in Lazimpat, a relatively queer-friendly area in Kathmandu. The location is essential because the first LGBTQIA+ movement in Nepal started in 2001 through the Blue Diamond Society.Inclusive Galaxy, true to its name, welcomes everyone—queer and non-queer alike—to share a comfortable space. His vision was clear: to create a space where people of all genders and sexual identities could come together without fear of exclusion.“I didn’t want to make it exclusively for queer people because that would be excluding ourselves from society. Different groups need to live together and understand each other,” Adhikari explains.In the early days, the cafe attracted both queer and non-queer customers. However, when some of the residents learned about Adhikari’s identity and the nature of the clientele, there was a brief period of hesitation. “At first, I didn’t understand what was happening, but then I realised my identity was an issue for a few people. I believe people should be judged by others by their character, not by their gender or sexuality. Over time, as residents saw that we operated like any other cafe, they became more comfortable,” Adhikari reflects.Adhikari started Inclusive Galaxy to give queer individuals a place to be proud of themselves, counteracting the self-doubt and insecurity that hiding one’s identity can cause. This turned the cafe very quickly into a community hub. The journey was not without challenges, though. It was difficult to hire staff and cooks from the LGBTQIA+ community, and soon after the restaurant opened, the COVID pandemic made things even harder.Despite these difficulties, the doors of Inclusive Galaxy remained open. During the pandemic, many queer individuals, who were abandoned by their families or afraid to return home, found comfort at Inclusive Galaxy.Since many couldn’t afford to pay for meals, the restaurant provided free food from its resources. As the number of people needing meals grew to 20-30 daily, Adhikari started raising funds within the community.“During my time as an activist, many people came here not only for food but also to see an organisation where the queer community supports one another,” Adhikari says.“The time during COVID was difficult, but it brought me closer to the community.”Four years after its inception, the restaurant has garnered a loyal following. Sarosy Neupane, Miss Pink Nepal 2024 first runner-up, describes Inclusive Galaxy as her second home. She moved to Kathmandu to study in 2022. Being distant from her family, she started visiting Galaxy for meals that reminded her of home-cooked food. Over time, she grew attached to the café because of its welcoming atmosphere.“It’s heartwarming to see people from our community and different walks of life here. The founders even invite us to festivals like ‘Dahi Chiura Khane din,’” she shares.Neupane visits the cafe regularly and sometimes stays until 3 am, engrossed in conversations. “I hope more spaces like this can open in the future. If, unfortunately, this place were to close someday, I don’t think we’d have any other place to turn to,” she adds.Muna Chhetri, a trans woman who has been a loyal customer for three years, shares, “This is my safe space where I can truly be myself. I always feel judged in other restaurants, but that fear doesn’t exist here. It’s where even those who aren’t accepted at home can feel accepted.”Sahara Khadka Chhetri, owner of Pink Tiffany, Kathmandu’s first openly LGBTIQIA+ friendly restaurant and bar, frequently visits after managing the bar, appreciating the convenience of not cooking at home.She notes very few places like this cater to our community, and some even had to close during COVID. “As an entrepreneur, I know that sustaining these spaces is a challenge. But as more spaces like these open, they will make the way for a more inclusive and compassionate society.”The welcoming atmosphere at Inclusive Galaxy has also had a surprising effect on non-queer patrons. Samriddha Jung Rana, a twenty-year-old neighbour who identifies as straight, often visits the café and appreciates the importance of such spaces.“Previously, I didn’t know much about the queer community and didn’t care much. But now, coming into this café, I’ve been interested in their rights and issues. I’ve realised that we’re not so different after all. We are all human,” he remarks.The ventures like Inclusive Galaxy and Pink Tiffany have inspired hope for collaborative businesses between queer and non-queer groups. The recent initiative by the Nepal Tourism Board promoting Pink Tourism in April 2024 is a positive step. Still, Adhikari believes that more support is needed from the government and the private sector.Despite the progress, challenges remain. However, Adhikari remains optimistic about the future. He is working on plans to develop the restaurant into a homestay program in the future.“Like how different planets, asteroids, and stars make up a beautiful galaxy, people from all walks of life and identities make a beautiful society. I am happy that we are assimilating together in this space. We are not so different; we are all different and similar simultaneously,” he says. \nAditya Mishra is a Nepali chef and entrepreneur based in New York. Passionate about elevating Nepali cuisine globally, Mishra sharpened his culinary skills while staging at various Michelin-starred restaurants in the city during his time at culinary school. A recipient of the James Beard Foundation National Scholars Scholarship in 2023, Mishra’s early experiences inspired him to establish his own supper club, ‘The Sewing Tin’, alongside co-founder Akhil Upad.In an interview with Post’s Aarati Ray, Mishra discusses his restaurant in New York, serving Nepali cuisines there and the recipe for his signature dish.How did your cooking journey start in New York?At 14, I told my parents I wanted to be a chef, but they preferred I pursue a stable career like engineering, as many Nepali families do. So, I left for Louisiana in 2019 to study engineering.But, cooking never left my heart so, after a year, I left engineering college and moved to New York City. It’s been three and a half years and my parents only learned about it later. When my mom visited me in NYC and saw my dedication to cooking, she saw my passion and supported my decision.What sparked your interest in cooking from a young age?As a child, I was drawn to cooking shows on TLC. The glamour of cooking, eating, travelling and the prosperity of famous chefs was fascinating.Around age 16, I discovered Chef Anthony Bourdain’s groundbreaking book, ‘Kitchen Confidential’, which shed light on the reality of the culinary industry. I learned how he became a cultural icon in NYC, reshaping perceptions of chefs.I was also fascinated by chefs like Marco Pierre White, who was a mentor to Gordon Ramsay. Their stories of achieving fame while maintaining discipline intrigued me. But, as I grew older and entered the culinary world, I realised it was far from glamorous—it involved dedication and I am glad I persevered.How did the idea for The Sewing Tin originate?The concept of ‘The Sewing Tin’ came when I realised the stark contrast between the romanticised view of kitchen work and its harsh reality. Witnessing the struggles of many kitchen staff—economic hardships, immigration challenges and language barriers—I had to rediscover my love for cooking.During my internship at ‘Junoon’ restaurant, I met my co-founder, Akhil Upad, who shared my culinary enthusiasm despite his preparations for medical college. Together, we wanted to create a dining experience that was more personal and communal, offering fine dining with a sense of community.We wanted our food to tell stories, so we named our restaurant ‘The Sewing Tin’ inspired by the immigrant experience in NYC. When immigrants opened cookie boxes as kids, they often found sewing supplies instead of food.‘The Sewing Tin’ is like opening a cookie box and finding sewing supplies—something uniquely desi, or South Asian. How do you promote Nepali cuisine in New York City through The Sewing Tin?My partner is from Atlanta with Indian roots, while I come from Nepal, so our menu celebrates and reflects both cultures and heritage.We represent our respective cultures authentically. For example, we have a dish inspired by Newari cuisine called kachaila, similar to French Tartar. We present it as Tartar to make it accessible to our customers but infuse it with Nepali flavours, telling stories about its origins and giving diners a taste of my homeland.What do you think of the prospects of Nepali cuisine abroad?I’m on a mission to share Nepali food worldwide. I have served up dishes like chatamari and lamb sekuwa in my restaurant. But I’m still learning and want to explore more of Nepal’s cuisines. My big dream? To make Nepali cuisine reach more places because it’s got something special that can wow taste buds everywhere.How do you see the changes in restaurants in Nepal?The restaurant industry has deep roots in community and bringing people together, dating back centuries. While this core idea remains, modern restaurants have evolved, making changes to adapt to the times.Yet, in Nepal, despite the growing number of restaurants, many lack uniqueness and storytelling, focusing more on making money than fostering a sense of community.I’ve noticed a troubling trend of rising prices, especially for beloved dishes like momos, which makes people question if they're getting value for their money. It seems like profits are taking precedence over creating genuine, authentic culinary experiences.The industry is starting to lose the creativity and passion that once made it special. It might be time for chefs to shake things up, challenge the norm and bring fresh ideas to the table, revitalising the culinary scene with renewed energy and creativity.What challenges have you faced in New York as an outsider?Living in a bustling city like New York as an outsider has its challenges. But, this city is also full of opportunities for those who are passionate. If you stay true to your culture and want to share your story, opportunities are waiting for you.Even though it can be daunting because of the tough competition, the city appreciates determination and expertise. When I started my journey here, all I wanted to do was cook, eat and share the story of Nepal and its diverse cultures. Instead of focusing on the difficulties, I embraced the chance to follow my passion.What do you think about the criticism of blending Nepali food with modern culinary styles?Chefs care about their food—it’s like they’re sharing a story. They’ve put in a lot of effort to become skilled, so let them be creative. It’s okay to give helpful advice but don’t be mean just to criticise. Chefs shouldn’t also just copy what’s popular, they should cook what they truly love. That’s what makes food special and meaningful.Mishra’s signature dish:Confit Duck Chatamari A traditional Nepali delicacy with French influence.Ingredients:Duck (Legs and breast)Rice (soaked overnight)MayonnaiseWhole spices (cloves, cinnamon, cardamom, bay leaf)Red onionGarlicGingerMula ko achar (Fermented radish)ScallionsLemon juiceNepali pepperVinegarSaltSugarProcedure:For the Duck:Season duck with salt and pepper.Cook in a covered pan with whole spices, garlic, and ginger at low heat for 2 hours on a stove (270 degrees in the oven)Increase heat to crisp up the skin (approximately 15 minutes).Shred the duck meat.Confit Garlic Aioli:Mash cooked garlic and ginger and mix with mayonnaise, lemon juice, Nepali pepper and fermented radishes.Pickled Onions:Slice onions and cook in a mixture of vinegar, water, salt, sugar, and whole spices until softened (about 10 minutes).For the chatamari:Blend soaked rice to make a batter, let it ferment for 6 hours, and adjust consistency with water.Assembling:Cook chatamari batter in duck fat for 4 minutes.Top with shredded duck, aioli, pickled onions and scallions.Serve \nCeleus Baral exudes a serene aura when you meet her, and when she tells you she bakes, it makes sense. Even during a brief encounter, you can tell she has the patience needed to be a baker.“You can eyeball cooking, but baking is chemistry. You have to be meticulous. You cannot rush it, or it does not turn out as expected,” says the 21-year-old environment science student. She also runs the online baking shop Bakeleus. Recently, she has also started selling her baked goods beyond her online shop, with her first stall appearing at The Yellow House’s Night Market. Bakeleus’s menu lists a variety of offerings, including jams, granola, tarts, cakes, cookies, cupcakes and brownies. Baral began baking in 2020, during the lockdown, and launched her online shop last year.She grows much of the produce she incorporates into her baking, and believes we should all understand the origins of our food. “This connection fosters gratitude and a deeper appreciation for nature,” she says. Her background in environmental science, coupled with her affinity for the natural world, imbues her creations with a unique artistic sensibility. Each item she bakes is a testament to her creativity and experimentation, as she believes consistent practice is the key to mastery.Despite the demands of being a full-time student, Baral strives to accommodate orders, typically requiring a minimum of 72 hours' notice for delivery. She is a passionate and discerning individual, evident in the love she infuses into her baking. Additionally, Baral advocates for a zero-waste policy at home, ensuring that every scrap of food and all household items are recycled.Three easy to bake recipes you can try at homeMini carrot cakes Ingredients:38 g milk or yoghurt35 g all-purpose flour1/4 tea spoon ground cinnamon1/8 tea spoon ground gingerA pinch of cardamom1 tea spoon baking powder½ tea spoon fine sea salt2 large eggs, at room temperature27 g granulated sugar13 g brown sugar (or 39 g of regular granulated sugar)1 tea spoon vanilla extract27 g extra virgin olive oil33 g carrots, peeled and shreddedChopped walnutsCandied lemon or orange slices (optional for garnish)Cream cheese frosting56.5 g unsalted butter, softened113.5 g cream cheese, softened1/2 teaspoon vanilla extractA pinch of salt250 g powdered sugarDirections:For the cake:Preheat the oven to 195°C.

The vegetable is relatively cheap and used in almost all cuisines and curries. This ubiquity could perhaps be why someone might be snubbingly called an ‘aloo’ in Nepal, but the reference does not make potatoes less important.Why have them With zero fat, potatoes contain many important nutrients—vitamins B1, B6, Vitamin C, which is an antioxidant, minerals and fibre. Along with starch, it is a good source of potassium, copper, vitamin C, manganese, phosphorus, niacin, dietary fibre and pantothenic acid. Potassium derived from potatoes is an electrolyte that benefits the heart, muscles and nervous system. Potato skin contains fibre, which is important for digestive health.Compared to other vegetables, potatoes are more energy-dense. It is free of fat, gluten, cholesterol and sodium. The relatively cheap plant-based food is also a good source of carbohydrates. Filled with nutrients, one can get a lot of them by consuming potatoes.Sourcing of potatoesPotatoes thrive in diverse climatic conditions. The country cultivates potatoes on around 200,000 hectares of land—from the plains of Tarai to the mountainous region.Every year, Nepal churns out around 3,410,000 tons of the stuff. It also imports potatoes and potato products worth Rs 8.71 billion.“These imports include potato chips, frozen potatoes and fresh potatoes,” said Biswas Poudel, a senior technical officer at the National Potato Research Programme.As its cultivation is possible in diverse landscapes, even climate change does not affect potato farming, experts say. Types of potatoesRed and white potatoes are popular and widely available in the country. Lately, dark potatoes or blue potatoes are gaining popularity.“Red potatoes are highly popular,” said Poudel. “Potatoes that come in colour contain more nutrients. Darker potatoes are packed with antioxidants.”Potatoes that taste sweet are a good source of vitamin A, an important nutrient for immunity and eye health. Purple potatoes are rich in antioxidants, including anthocyanins that may prevent heart disease and cancer and boost brain health.Other benefits As potatoes contain important nutrients, they benefit human health in multiple ways. Iron, phosphorus, calcium, magnesium, and zinc contained in potatoes help the body build and maintain its structure and strength. Consumption of the vegetable that is rich in potassium, calcium and magnesium helps reduce blood pressure naturally. Potatoes also contain a significant amount of fibre, which helps in lowering cholesterol levels in the blood and ultimately lessens the risk of heart disease. Fibre also boosts digestive health.Compared to other green vegetables, farmers use only a minimal amount of pesticides in potatoes, making them safe to eat. Chips and french friesOf late potato chips and french fries are gaining popularity in Nepal. They are also popular dishes in most restaurants and people have even started making french fries at home. Children love potato chips the most. Intake of nutrients and micronutrients, fibre and antioxidants components depends on how potatoes were cooked or prepared for food.Consumption of a lot of chips and french fries can lead to added calories and unhealthy weight gain.“Fibre and antioxidant and other micronutrients of the potatoes may be lost while frying,” said Poudel. “As potatoes are a carbohydrate-rich vegetable, it is not necessary to consume them with rice, which many people do in Nepal.”Experts say diabetic people should limit their potato intake as they cause spikes in blood sugar. \nChicken eggs are a healthy, nutritious superfood, containing most of the minerals and vitamins a body needs. They are relatively cheap as well. They are a complete source of protein, credited with a reduction in malnutrition in children and pregnant women in recent years in Nepal.According to nutritionists, consuming eggs daily has multiple benefits including weight loss, reduced blood pressure and protection against infections.Sourcing of our eggs Nepal is self-reliant on chicken eggs. According to the Nepal Egg Producers Association, poultry farmers in the country produce 3.1 million eggs a day.“Our production is sufficient to meet domestic demand,” said Shiva Ram KC, chairman of the association.Sizes and types Eggs are mostly available in two sizes—big and medium. Big-sized eggs cost Rs450 a crate (30 eggs) while medium-sized ones cost Rs435 a crate. Pastured eggs or eggs from local chickens are also available but they cost more than double the price of eggs produced in poultry farms. These are called Omega-3-enriched eggs, which are more nutritious than those produced on farms. Nutritionists say such eggs contain higher amounts of Omega-3 fat and are high in vitamins A and E. Omega-3 fatty acids are also known to reduce blood levels of triglycerides, a well-known risk factor for heart disease. As pastured eggs are scarce, one has to directly contact farmers to buy them. Officials at the Department of Food Technology said that generally, pastured eggs are not produced in bulk, but they may be made available through some trusted suppliers. Why have them, and how many? As chicken eggs are rich in protein, most minerals and vitamins, there are multiple reasons to take them. A whole egg contains Vitamin A, Vitamin B9, Vitamin B5, Vitamin B 12, Vitamin B 2, Vitamin D, E, B6, minerals—phosphorus, selenium, calcium and zinc.“A healthy adult can eat 1–2 eggs a day without hesitation,” said Dr Atul Upadhyay, a nutritionist. “A whole egg contains almost all the nutrients a body needs.”What about the quality of eggs? No agency in the country is checking the quality of the eggs being sent to the market. The issue of excessive use of antibiotics in chicken is often raised but no one talks about the presence of antibiotic residue in eggs.Studies in other countries including India show high levels of antibiotic-resistant pathogens in chickens raised for meat and eggs.The Department of Food Technology and Quality Control examines the quality of processed foods containing eggs but does not check the quality of eggs per se. Experts say there is no mechanism in the country to ascertain the quality of eggs. It is also difficult to determine the quality of eggs by merely looking at them, for instance whether they have thick or thin shells.Other benefits Eggs help in weight loss and strengthening prenatal bone. They increase mental energy. The lutein in the eggs enhances skin’s moisture and the protein helps tighten the skin. Egg yolk boosts skin complexion, as they are high in fatty acids, nutritionists say.Daily consumption of eggs might lower the risk of stroke. Antioxidants lutein and zeaxanthin contained in eggs help prevent eye diseases like cataracts and age-related muscle degeneration. Choline in eggs is important for pregnant women and breastfeeding mothers, as it helps with baby’s brain development. \n“How much oxygen do you have for the summit?”I think this is the kind of question a film producer would ask. But when you're on the mountain, the answer is never clear.I have worked for a long time in the film industry and different art areas, especially photography and engraving.Working in various fields and drawing inspiration from them has become a new normal for me. I have made this approach my way of life without even realising it.I took responsibility for producing the last movie I worked on and shot the behind-the-scenes footage for a documentary. By doing so, I witnessed the entire shooting process and the journey of a movie.In the snowy highlands of Turkey, we had to endure the consequences of the changing climate to shoot ‘About Dry Grasses’, directed by Nuri Bilge Ceylan. The highlands used to be snowy in January, but by the time we got there in the same month, there was no snow. Nature was changing. It was responding to what was happening—to what humanity had done to it. In the end, it snowed, and we shot the intense snow scenes we wanted. But since most of our days were sunny, unlike what the director wanted, we had to shoot in the sunset and sunrise hours. As crew members, we spent many days waiting for the sun to set.Production requires creating opportunities, finding solutions, and being creative for a work of art to come true. For this, patience, endurance, calmness, and timing are necessary. On the other hand, nature wanted us to listen to it and wait for the right time.During that time, I witnessed many of nature's lessons. For example, I experienced extreme cold for the first time. We endured temperatures ranging from -33 degrees to +55 degrees. By listening to nature, surrendering to its forces, and working within its limits, we managed to persevere.No matter how much you prepare or plan during the pre-production phase, if you are working in nature, remember that nature will always have the final say.The film was completed, released, and connected with audiences. Its success at Cannes 2023 was followed by my trip to the North Pole for my project. I returned with a mix of wonderful developments, joys, and challenges. During this process, I experienced life and death, happiness and sadness, losses and awards.I realised the value of being able to breathe comfortably a few days after my father's chemotherapy ended. Just a few days earlier, he had said, \"Well done, my daughter. I'm glad you went!\" All the anxiety and hard work, filled with fears at the beginning, were finally behind me.Before going to Everest, when I was on the verge of giving up, defeated by my fears, I remembered my father's words. Everest reminded me of what he said while struggling to breathe, adding a turning point to my life.What does it mean to say ‘life’s turning point?’ How many turning points can there be in life?Who am I, and what am I doing in this world? How well do I know my own limits? Can I find answers to these big questions? These thoughts sparked my dream of journeying to Everest. Now, after returning, I can say that it turned my life around.“How much oxygen do you need for the summit?” sounds more like “How much do you need to hold on to life?” How many reasons do you find that give meaning to your life, keep you alive, and allow you to breathe? How much can you endure in the face of obstacles, and can you keep believing that a solution will eventually come your way?Can these questions be separated from the idea of measuring and assessing something, from learning its quantity and financial value? Can everything be known with certainty? Should the journey be fully understood in advance, with all its promises laid out? Should it be viewed like a purchase with a price tag, asking, “Is this journey worth this much?”I had never trekked before and had no climbing experience. I had lived at sea level my entire life and had never been to a high altitude.However, this journey was not only about the physical climb but also an inner discovery. After losing my father to lung cancer, his breathing difficulties taught me the fragility of breath, life, and existence. I also mentally prepared myself for the physical challenges I might face. Despite all my concerns, could this journey help me understand the cycle of life and the resilience of the soul?So, how could I make this trek possible? How could I land in Nepal? Despite all the economic difficulties and the many things I felt needed organising, I did my best and believed in it.Since I was embarking on this journey, I felt I should share about my travels and inspire others.Starting with photography, cinema, and engraving, which are already integral parts of my life, I dreamed of documenting and sharing the inspiring aspects of this journey.After months of correspondence and dreaming, it all came true. Finally, I embarked on the journey with the goal of creating photographs, engravings, and documentaries. I learned a great deal from my travels in Nepal, from the people I met, and from every moments I witnessed. I felt incredibly fortunate to have been able to honour my father’s memory with the peace and serenity I experienced in the Himalayas.During my 15-day journey to Everest Base Camp, I encountered nature’s masterpieces at every turn. As concerns like “How will I endure?” and “How will I finish?” started to weigh on me, the mountains suddenly parted with the clouds and gazed down at me.It was amazing to witness the appearance of ‘Gods’ that I had never seen before, in such immense size and in such a close, awe-inspiring manner beside me during that silent walk.As someone who came from one of the most crowded cities in the world, Istanbul, while I struggled with my daily questions and uncertainties, trying to control everything, they stood there calmly, as if answering me.They were just there—before and after.My guide, Lakhpa Sherpa, always reminded me not to worry about how high we were, how long it would take to reach our accommodation, or what the weather would be like. He encouraged me to live in the moment, and he was right.He advised me to focus on my breathing, not to get thirsty, to eat enough, and to appreciate the extraordinary beauty of the journey. In the mountains, plans dissolve and each moment is embraced as it comes.All the good wishes, prayers, and everything encountered along the way were for the journey itself. The mountain was full of life, secrets, and everything I had wondered about.This 15-day journey to Everest Base Camp was a solo adventure, yet I wouldn't have been able to complete it without my guide, Lhakpa, and my porter. Additionally, I was fortunate enough to experience the hospitality, generosity, and honesty at Trekkers Paradise, which organised the entire journey and provided guidance.I witnessed how dedication and sincerity are crucial in completing a journey safely and healthily. Ghanshyam Sharma, from Trekkers Paradise and Sauraj Jhingan, a climber who summited the Everest in 2018, shared their experiences with me during the journey.They experienced the 2015 earthquake while they were at the Everest Base Camp.As a filmmaker, their role as actors, and attention to detail played a significant role in bringing my dream photography and documentary project to life.The sponsors of my journey were Turkish Airlines, The North Face, Apple, Canon, and Stanley. My supporters include Oscar International College and Nepal Film Campus. Throughout the journey, I shared many experiences, memories, and countless photos and images with my students.On my way back home after 21 days, I celebrated my birthday on the plane. From the right window, the Himalayas bid me farewell. I felt like I had opened a new chapter in my life, and I was certain that I would return.I had made many friends and memories in Nepal.For now, I will be working on a documentary and preparing for a photography and engraving exhibition titled ‘My Soul Beyond the Mountain’.To the Himalayas: This summer was spent with you, but we will meet again soon. \nWe spent five days in Sri Lanka two weeks ago, driving up and down the island, covering almost 70 percent of its territory. Our tour spanned over 1,000 kilometres, including hills, beach spots, and heritage and religious sites.Our first stop in Sri Lanka was Colombo’s Bandaranaike International Airport. We were greeted by a warm and humid breeze when we exited the airport. The host briefed us (a group of journalists) that heavy rainfall has affected areas across Sri Lanka since mid-May 2024. Rain and storms intensified on June 1, with the most significant effects in the south and west of the country. We were lucky to have no rain in the forecast.On the first night, we checked into the lavish Jetwing Lake resort, an opulent sanctuary amidst the lush landscape. The resort’s expansive grounds were a retreat, offering a glimpse of Sri Lanka's natural beauty. We feasted on delicious cuisine, every bite exploding with flavour, introducing us to the island’s famed culinary delights. On June 7, early morning, the sun shone brightly, previewing the promise of an incredible journey ahead. We set off early the following day, eager to explore the mysteries of this enchanting island. As we ventured further into the heart of Sri Lanka, the landscape revealed its majestic nature. We were astounded by seeing Pidurangala Rock, a 200-metre-high granite colossus just a kilometre north of Sigiriya. The short hike to Pidurangala Rock offered breathtaking views of Sigiriya and beyond. We climbed the steep steps and soon were rewarded with a breathtaking panoramic view of the surrounding landscape. It took us 30 minutes to climb. The sight took our breaths away and left us humbled in the presence of such grandeur. From the top are glorious vistas of the surrounding landscape and an incredible view of the majestic Sigiriya Rock. From there, Sigiriya Lion’s Rock is visible, standing alone. This was the place where demon king Ravana had his palace in the Treta Yuga. Believed to have been built 50 centuries ago, the palace is said to have had a unique lift for Ravana and his visitors. Ravana imprisoned Sita in one of the caves at the bottom of this humongous boulder. Sigiriya is a fifth-century fortress in Sri Lanka carved out of an inselberg, a hill of hard volcanic rock that soared high above the surrounding jungle. We spent two hours atop the rock, mainly taking photographs. We descended from Pidurangala Rock, filled with awe and a sense of accomplishment.The journey ahead seemed even more enticing as we ventured along the winding roads, heading towards our next destination.Cash-strapped Sri Lanka plunged into its worst financial crisis in more than seven decades in 2022, with a severe dollar shortage sending inflation soaring to a high of 70 percent, its currency to record lows, and its economy contracting 7.3 percent.Thanks to the growing number of tourists, Sri Lanka is now bouncing back.In Jetwing Lake, we met Kasun Pradeep Somasiri, a receptionist. He briefed us that the resort is now 50 percent occupied. “That’s a better figure now as we are recovering.”The travel and tourism sector is a significant income generator for Sri Lanka. However, the economic crisis, the Ukraine–Russia war, and China’s zero-Covid policy have jeopardised the industry.Tourism accounted for more than 12 percent of the country’s GDP in 2019 and was the third-largest source of foreign exchange reserves, behind worker remittances and the apparel industry.Sri Lanka was poised to be one of the world’s best holiday destinations due to its rich culture, wealth of natural resources, and diversity of accessible experiences.However, tourism-dependent Sri Lanka suffered its first major setback with the Easter bombings 2019. This led to the collapse of inbound tourism flows as international arrivals declined by 18 percent year-on-year, and tourist expenditure fell by 17.7 percent that year. This was immediately followed by two years of pandemic restrictions. Inbound visitors fell to just 116,600 in 2021.An acute balance of payments crisis forced Sri Lanka to preemptively default on foreign debt of over $50 billion in April 2022, triggering a crippling economic contraction with spiralling inflation.“Tourism is gaining momentum,” says Somasiri. “The British and Chinese have started to return to Sri Lanka.”January-August is the peak season for foreigners. “From December to April, local people travel for holiday purposes,” says Somasiri. Before we started the tour to other religious sites, our tour guide, Sampath Mayadunne, told us, “Don't take selfies with your back to Buddha.” Turning your back on a Buddha statue and some other religious sites to take photos and videos is a strict no-no.The most common sight across Sri Lanka is the tank cascades system, an ancient irrigation infrastructure. The system is a network of small tanks draining to large reservoirs that store rainwater and surface runoff for later use.“These infrastructures were built by its ancient kings over 2,000 years ago to solve the water scarcity in the country’s dry zone,” says Mayadunne.On day two, we travelled to Ranweli Spice Garden in Matale. This garden is famous for its rare spices and herbs. A tour of the gardens will show you the cultivation, harvesting, cleaning, and packaging process, as well as the health benefits and uses of the herbs.On the way, we saw a colourful Muthumariamman Hindu temple, boasting hundreds of detailed sculptures in a rich mosaic of colour.In Kandy, we visited the Temple of the Tooth Relic (Sri Dalada Maligawa), one of the most sacred places of worship in the Buddhist world. It was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1988.The temple sustained damage from bombings by Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna in 1989 and by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam in 1998. However, it was fully restored each time.We then headed to Jetwing St Andrew’s, a luxurious 5-star property in Sri Lanka’s hill country of Nuwara Eliya, situated at 1,900 metres above sea level. During our stay in Kandy, we immersed ourselves in the city's charm and the serenity of the countryside. On the third day, early morning, we travelled to Nuwara Eliya, the area famous for tea estates that give many Nepalis the feeling that they have come to Kanyam, Ilam, in eastern Nepal.We visited a tea factory called Damro Labookellie Tea Centre, the oldest tea centre in Sri Lanka. Due to its cold climate, it is the most important area for tea production in Sri Lanka.In this tea factory, they make white and black tea, while the green tea is processed in another tea factory and then sent to Damro.After the tea factory tour and the tea tasting, we headed to Galle, our next resting point.We encountered narrow, winding, and maze-like streets and alleys in Nuwara Eliya, known as ‘Little England’. The town has preserved almost all its British-era buildings and is calm and beautiful. On our way to Galle, at the roadside, our tour guide stopped us at the famed Sita temple, which has Hanuman's footprints and is the place where Sita, wife of Lord Rama, was held captive by the demon king Ravana after he abducted her from India.We were at Sita Eliya, a temple named Sri Seethai Amman.When we reached the Hindu temple, rich in vibrant colours and architectural elements, it was full of devotees. The water stream adjoining the temple is believed to be where Sita bathed. Large footprints are found on the stones in the stream, and there is a saying that those belong to Hanuman, who came spying to find Sita’s whereabouts.In Ella, Ravana’s waterfalls are significant in the Rama-Ravana story. The cascade charms visitors from all over the globe. The waterfall is easily accessible and is known to have hidden caves at the top, which are believed to have been used as Ravana's residence.The 25-metre-tall waterfall is a beautiful cascade that provides the perfect backdrop for a photo to remember your Ramayana trail adventures in Sri Lanka. A short pilgrimage tour ended there, and it was now time for an adventure. Though it was not part of our itinerary, our guide decided to tour us on a train ride.Though short, only six kilometres from Ella to Demodera, it was thrilling. Everyone screamed in unison like kids on a fair ride to hear the echoes in the dark every time we passed through the tunnels. The sound of the train is subtly different inside a tunnel. For the first-timer, the darkness and shouts inside the tunnels when the train passes would be scary, like a horror movie.The train we boarded wasn’t crowded, but people had already filled the doorway, ready for the scenic journey.With the shrill sound of a whistle, the train slowly pulled away from the platform at Ella, passing houses, coconut trees and green fields.As the train progressed, tourists and locals were leaning out the windows and crowding to hang out the doors. I joined the crowd and hung out on a train. A short excitement ended there.After lunch, we headed to Galle and reached Jetwing Lighthouse. As soon as our group entered the hotel, they shouted with excitement.The hotel is on a rocky outcrop three miles west of Galle. Waves crash over giant boulders in front of it and produce howling winds.We were at Galle’s 17th-century fort five minutes from the hotel on day four. In the Bay of Galle on the southwest coast of Sri Lanka, Galle Fort was built first in 1588 by the Portuguese and lavishly rebuilt by the Dutch during the 17th century. It is a historical, archaeological and architectural heritage monument that maintains a perfect appearance even after more than 436 years.We then reached Hikkaduwa Beach, a popular beach destination on the southern coast of Sri Lanka. On the way, we saw a 30-metre-high Big Buddha Statue. It is a replica of the 6th-century Buddhas of Bamiyan destroyed by the Taliban in Afghanistan. It was created using the earliest known sketches of the statue. It was built in remembrance of the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami victims.We then travelled through the 222-kilometre-long Southern Expressway, Sri Lanka's first expressway linking the capital, Colombo, with Galle, Matara, and Hambantota, significant cities south of the island.On day five, we reached Colombo, the capital of Sri Lanka. Jetwing Colombo Seven hosted us in the bustling capital. We took a city tour early morning and visited Bally's Casino at night.On day six, we returned to Kathmandu early in the morning on a Sri Lankan Airlines flight, the airline that organised the trip in coordination with Jetwing Hotels Limited, a Sri Lankan hotel chain.National flag carrier Nepal Airlines, in its previous avatar as Royal Nepal Airlines, used to operate direct flights to Colombo during the 1980s. However, the carrier suspended operations following an armed movement by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) in Sri Lanka. There had been no direct air links between the two countries for decades.In 2016, Himalaya Airlines started a chartered flight that lasted a few months due to low traffic movement between the two countries. Sri Lankan Airlines started operating direct flights to Kathmandu in August 2021.“The main objective of this media tour is to increase tourism in both countries for mutual benefit. We want to draw Nepalis for pilgrims and leisure activities,” says Nilina Pathirana, Country Manager at Srilankan Airlines in Nepal.“We have understood that Nepali travellers tend to travel to Bangkok, Vietnam, Malaysia, Dubai, and Maldives. Nepalis have quite minimal knowledge about Sri Lanka and the religious connection between Lanka and Nepal. We want to promote Nepal and Sri Lanka jointly. This will be a win-win business,” added Pathirana.The airline said it currently carries 60 percent of the passengers from Nepal to Sri Lanka and beyond destinations like Tokyo, Sydney, Melbourne, and other Middle Eastern destinations. The return airfare for a 3.5-hour-long flight starts at Rs74,000. “We have a four-night, five-day package that begins from Rs80,000, depending on the properties and extended itineraries,” says Pathirana.Nepalis must submit certain required documents for visa processing, like their passport copy and bank statement. Due to this government-to-government policy, only Nepalis must obtain a prior visa. Otherwise, Sri Lankans are required to have a visa upon arrival.“The other best thing is that Sri Lankan Airlines can be involved with the visa process or facilitate the Nepalis tourists. Our main intention is to have a sustainable market in Kathmandu and make it a daily flight,” says Pathirana. \nMundhum Trek in Koshi province in the eastern part of Nepal is a new cultural walking trail. It passes through several indigenous ethnic villages and landscapes in Khotang and Bhojpur districts. This trail goes up to an elevation of 4,200 metres to the viewpoint of Silchung Peak and takes one through the settlements of the Kirati people. This route starts from Diktel Bazaar and passes through beautiful settlements like Chakhewa, Rawa Dhap, Salpa Bhanjyang, Silchung and Hanspokhari before ending in Bhojpur. There are some hotels in Diktel but trekkers are advised to carry tents. The trail offers panoramic views of most of the eight-thousanders, including Everest, Lhotse, Makalu, Cho Oyu and Kanchenjunga mountains. The spring season, March through May, is highly recommended for the trek.Janaki Mandir Janaki Mandir at Janakpur in Madhesh province was constructed in 1874 and is a blend of Mughal and local architecture. The temple is a three-storey building and has 60 rooms, making it the largest temple in Nepal. Pilgrims flock here by the thousands to pay homage to Janaki Mandir—Janaki being the other name of Sita, the daughter of King Janak. The temple houses an idol of Sita which was found near Ayodhya, the kingdom of Ram. The marriage anniversary of Lord Ram and Sita is celebrated in Janakpur every year on Vivaha Panchami, which falls in December. In the southwest corner of Janaki Mandir is the Vivaha Mandap, which has been built at the site where the marriage of Ram and Sita is said to have taken place. Another well-known temple in the vicinity is Ram Mandir, which is built in pagoda style and is hence different from the other temples in Janakpur that generally bear resemblance to Mughal architecture. It houses a female statue, said to be of Yogamaya, which has the reputation of being one of the most beautiful images of female forms in Nepal. Other holy sites of interest include the Laxman Temple, Sankat Mochan Temple and Hanuman Temple.Kuri Village, Kalinchok Kuri village, a popular tourist destination around 150 km from Kathmandu, lies at an altitude of 3,842 metres above sea level in Kalinchowk of Dolakha district, in Bagmati province. People visit the place to enjoy the snow during the winter besides the mesmerising landscapes and splendid panoramic view of the Himalayan range. Kalinchok gets snow mainly at the end of December and the snowfall continues till the end of February or mid-March. When there is snow, it is difficult for jeeps, buses and cars to reach the top of Kuri village. Chains are wrapped around the wheels of vehicles and specially modified jeeps with highly experienced drivers are used to carry visitors. There are several hotels and restaurants in the area. The road up to Kuri has also improved over the years.Annapurna Base Camp Annapurna Base Camp trek, in Gandaki province, makes for a picturesque journey that takes you to the foothills of the Annapurna South, up to 4,130 metres above sea level. The five-day trek (seven days for slow walkers) offers rich cultural diversities, typical Nepali villages and the flora and fauna nestled at the foothills of Annapurna. The distance from Pokhara to Annapurna Base Camp is approximately 81 kilometres. It is among the shortest and most budget-friendly treks in Nepal. For Nepalis, lodging costs around $5 to $10 per day. For foreigners, the overall cost of the trek ranges from $800 to $1500 on average per person. Annapurna Base Camp trek can be done at any time throughout the year as each season offers a different trekking experience. The ideal time for the trek depends on your weather preferences and what you expect from it. However, autumn (September to October) and spring (March to May) are considered the two best seasons for the trek, as the days at the time are warm and bright with clear skies.Bardiya National Park Bardiya National Park, located in the southern Tarai belt of Lumbini province, is home to one of the most elusive and majestic animals on earth—the Royal Bengal Tiger. The park, which covers an area of 968 square kilometres, is considered one of the most important protected areas in the country. It is a prime destination for those looking to catch a glimpse of a tiger. A bit of luck and patience will offer a good chance to see the Bengal Tiger. The jungle safari also offers one the opportunity to spot Asian elephants and the greater one-horned rhinoceros. The rare Gangetic river dolphins are occasionally spotted on rafting trips along the Geruwa River, the eastern channel of the Karnali river. Besides, visitors can enjoy the homestays and explore local Tharu culture. The right time to visit the park is from mid-September to mid-December and mid-February to May.Khaptad National Park Khaptad National Park in Sudurpaschim province is a protected area in the far western region. It stretches over four districts of Bajhang, Bajura, Achham and Doti and ranges in elevation from 1,400 to 3,300 metres. The park can be visited throughout the year. Trekkers are advised to bring their tents, food and other supplies. The Nepal Tourism Board says of late, social media has been increasingly influencing Nepali travellers to go to Khaptad. Since the far-flung Khaptad National Park is still offbeat for many travellers, the area remains pristine and fresh. The seasons of spring (March-May) and autumn (October-November) are the ideal times to visit the park. The temperature ranges from 10°c to 20°c offering pleasant trekking weather. The monsoon begins in June and lasts until September and during this time, roads often become muddy and slippery. From December to February, winter brings snow and chilling winds to the park.Limi Valley \nOnce again, my heart swelled with joy when my hometown came into view.Arriving at Lalikharka after the treacherous journey through Pauwa Bhanjyang and the bustling Kanchhi Dokan, Phidim, the headquarters of Panchthar district, revealed itself like a surprise gift. My home town, Phidim, is unique in the fact that it reveals to travellers approaching it from uphill. As the vehicle descends the mountain road, it slowly comes into view, its houses and buildings recognisable for the native son.This Dashain, I undertook the much-awaited trip to my hometown with my wife Kabita and daughter Aarohi. Little did I anticipate the transformation that awaited me.The moment I got out of the jeep, I noticed that Phidim, nestled in the lush hills, has undergone a remarkable transformation over the years. As I guided my family to my home, which had suffered damages in the 1989 quake that struck eastern Nepal, I found that old, mud and stone houses had been replaced by concrete buildings. The place was vastly different from the one I remembered.Arriving at my childhood home felt like reuniting with an old friend. Navigating its nooks and crannies with my daughter, we delved into the history of the house, a symbol of my cherished memories.My wife had visited Phidim years ago, spending a month with my parents. She, too, recalled beautiful moments she had had in the town. I asked the tenant about the neighbours and acquaintances. Some had died, while others had left for good.A call to local journalist Giriraj Banskota led me to the school grounds, where memories flooded back. This was where I spent my teenage years, playing ball, learning to kick, and watching major tournaments. Here, I even encountered a group of Western climbers headed to Kanchenjunga, the world’s third-highest mountain. I remember being awed by their shiny yellow tents, headlights and strange smell. I remember practising my tutephuteko Angrezi with the climbers. Birendra Shield, an annual sports tournament named after the late king, brought ace players from various schools in Panchthar district. The district also hosted Yuba Mela, an annual three-day fair to commemorate the birthday of the king, organising football tournaments in which teams from as far as Sunsari and Taplejung participated. I never excelled at dribbling balls. A boy growing up in a seven-member family, I soon found my interest in literature. In the late 1980s, Phidim hosted a major literary festival. In the run-up to the 1990 pro-democracy protest, walls were painted with anti-monarchy slogans, local politicians were arrested. I took my family to my school, Naya Namuna Secondary School. It was Saturday, so the school was closed. I peeked through the steel gate and wall, imagining myself labouring over classes. Memories are hazy, but what I remember most is going out of the school—to quiz contests with me leading the school team, to essay competitions at the District Education Office and to play carom board, a national pastime, in a nearby shopfront. Returning to the main street, the demolition of a landmark gate made me reflect on how cities transform, shedding old landmarks for new identities. Navigating narrow alleyways, I felt like a stranger in my own hometown. Multistory buildings have emerged and roads have been paved, reshaping the town. It’s the same place with a different face, leaving me nostalgic for the Phidim of my memories.We finally reached Shivalaya temple, which I told my wife and daughter was one of my cherished hangouts. A giant statue of Falgunanda (the Kirant leader’s birthday is celebrated on November 10) stood before the steps to the temple. Though my wife suspected I came here to smoke, in reality, I visited the temple in the evening to meet friends and talk about issues that mattered most to us at the time. It also offered a panoramic view of the town (I could not take my family to Gadhi Danda, a hillock across the Shivalaya).Towards the end of my journey, I felt sad about Phidim’s lack of prospects. To my dismay, I found that people have been leaving the town in droves. Despite blacktopped roads and multi-story buildings, Phidim faces a troubling reality. The lack of quality higher education and specialist healthcare has driven people away, echoing the circumstances that led me to Kathmandu years ago. Conversations with locals confirmed a mass exodus from the town, a trend that raises concerns about Phidim's future.My conversations with familiar strangers led me to conclude that Phidim has transformed into a transit town for pilgrims heading to Pathibhara Devi Temple, which is around 255 kilometres north in Taplejung district. I met dozens of people headed to the holy site. While pilgrims see it as a stopover, for me, it was a homecoming. The realisation dawned that Phidim is, perhaps, in a state of transition, trading its rustic charm for the hallmarks of urbanisation. While I left Phidim for higher education in Kathmandu, people from rural areas have flocked to the town in search of better opportunities, bringing life and energy to the once quiet community.As we bid adieu to my hometown, I couldn’t help but reflect on the inevitability of leaving a place, no matter how enamoured one is with it. Passing Kanchhi Dokan, I pointed out Kanchnajungha and Kumbhakarna to my daughter—symbols of my childhood. Phidim, now a blend of nostalgia and change, remains etched in my heart, a testament to the intricate dance between memory and evolution. \nThe gate leading inside the city of Lucknow proudly declares, “Muskuraiye aap Lucknow mein hain” (Smile because you are in Lucknow). During my brief stay, the city lived upto its promise. Known as the city of Nawabs, with a rich history going centuries back, the city is abuzz with autos, rickshaws, honks of public buses and the constant loud sounds of the metro going over your head, irritable honks of public buses and food that leaves you wanting more.In such a happening place stands Bara Imambara, built in 1784 by Asaf-ud-Daula. ‘Bara’ means big, and ‘Imambara’ is a building with a big hall where people assemble for mourning congregations. This building was originally built to provide employment for the public because, at that period, the country was going through a famine, and it was seen as a relief project. I walked through the grand entrance gate known as Rumi Darwaza (Turkish Gate), wiping my sweat and fighting the Lucknow heat, entering the vast complex. Echoing in all corners was a voice from the speaker that kept reminding the visitors of the many rules inside the historical place. I tried not to let the wonder overwhelm me as I walked through the complex. To my right stood the elegant Asafi Mosque, recently painted in cream-like white. Its design is visually pleasing and a testament to the Mughal era’s artistic finesse. Its walls are adorned with intricate calligraphy and elegant designs, reminiscent of a time when such aesthetics held great importance. I couldn’t help but admire the tremendous effort the craftsmen put into bringing the Nawab’s vision to life, meticulously crafting the elegant domes which seemed to touch the sky. The mosque’s serene atmosphere stands in stark contrast to the bustling city just beyond its walls.Upon stepping into the main hall—known as Asafi Hall—I was immediately struck by its sheer size. It is vast and impressive, appearing to stretch into eternity, and its massive arched roof seemed to defy gravity. What’s even more intriguing is that it stands without the support of pillars or beams. The interlocking system of bricks, a hidden secret, upholds this colossal structure, leaving one in awe of the brilliance of the builders of the past.This very hall houses a large vaulted central chamber with the tomb of Asaf-ud-Daula. Standing beside his tomb was a chilling moment, knowing that the remains of a great historical figure was resting just a few feet below. After scanning the large hall, the guide took me to my favourite part of the Imambara—the labyrinth or the Bhool Bhulaiyaa. This labyrinth sits right above the main hall, and because the hall is unsupported, the ceiling had to be lightweight, so the hollow labyrinth was born. It is quite impossible to figure out the Bhool Bhulaiyaa on your own, as it is a confusing network of corridors and staircases. So, it is necessary to have the company and guidance of a guide.As I moved with my guide through the maze, I thought I could feel the presence of the past inhabitants who had walked through these confusing passageways. What fascinated me most was the maze’s design: every sound, no matter how faint, echoed through the structure, enhancing its aura of mystery.The guide whispered from a distance, his head close to the wall, and the sound reached my ears, even though he was out of sight. It felt as if the walls carried the whispers. We exchanged astonished glances. When the guide reappeared, he smiled and remarked, “Now, you understand why they say that walls have ears.”Exiting the maze, I climbed to the roof, which offered a breathtaking view of Lucknow. The city spread out in front of me, its modern skyline contrasting the monument’s historic charm. It was a moment of reflection, contemplating how centuries had passed, and yet, Bara Imambara stood as a timeless witness to the changing tides of history. As I stood there, taking it all in, I felt recharged by the air coming in from all directions. After descending from the terrace, my brisk guide led me to the final stop in the Imambara, Shahi Baoli (Stepwell). Also referred to as the royal stepwell, it sits underground and is another example of architectural brilliance in the complex. This didn’t surprise me much since it was built at a time when architecture wasn’t just functional but also a work of art.The moment I descended the steps that led me underground, I noticed the sudden drop in temperature. The Shahi Baoli served as a cool refuge during the blistering summer day. The well-planned architecture of the Baoli allowed it to naturally regulate its temperature. The way to the main well is locked, but visitors can throw coins through jail-like doors into the well in order to try out their luck, much like we do in Davis Falls in Pokhara.Entering the underground corridors, I felt a slight chill because it was cold and dimly lit. I turned on my phone’s flashlight and saw the walls adorned with intricate Mughal carvings. Upon reaching a spot where we could see the well, the guide informed us that the well acted as a CCTV camera at the time. He explained that individuals inside the structure could discreetly observe those entering, as their reflections would be visible on the well’s water, but the people entering could not see the people inside the building.I waited to see that happen, and when a group entered through the gate, I was stunned; their faces were perfectly mirrored on the water’s surface, showcasing the ingenuity behind the well’s design, serving both as a water source and a security measure.My experience at Bara Imambara was a delightful one. I had never seen such a remarkable work of architecture before—it is beautiful, interesting and ahead of its time. \nBrazil missed a string of chances and were left to rue a lack of quality in the final third after they were held 0-0 by Costa Rica in their Copa America Group D opener in Los Angeles on Monday.Brazil, who came into the Copa America on the back of a run of poor results in recent months, dominated possession but lacked precision in front of goal with just three of their 19 shots on target.“Now it’s about being honest with ourselves, creating alternatives to create chances, scoring, results are important in this competition, points left at the beginning can complicate things at the end,” Brazil defender Marquinhos said.They were frustrated by a resolute five-man Costa Rican defence, who looked to contain their opponents and deprive them of space. The strategy paid dividends even if Gustavo Alfaro’s side rode their luck at times.Raphinha had an excellent early opportunity to score after latching onto a long ball over the top from Rodrygo, but Costa Rica keeper Patrick Sequeira came quickly off his line to snuff out the danger.Brazil thought they had got the breakthrough in the 30th minute when a free kick was flicked on by Rodrygo into the path of Marquinhos, who poked it in at the far post but the goal was disallowed for offside after a lengthy VAR delay.The one-way traffic continued after the break and Lucas Paqueta rattled the woodwork with a long-range effort in the 63rd minute before a venomous Guilherme Arana strike was kept out by a fine save from Sequeira.Coach Dorival Junior brought on youngsters Endrick and Savio in the 70th minute as Brazil desperately sought a winner but Paqueta twice shot wide in the final 10 minutes as the nine-times champions failed to break the deadlock.“We played a great game, we fought until the end, I had three chances myself, we were frustrated not to win, but we left with confidence, we fought,” Paqueta said.“We played our game, we have to improve our finishing, myself in particular and other players, so that we can win.”Brazil’s all-time leading scorer Neymar, who has been sidelined by an anterior cruciate ligament injury, cut a dejected figure as he looked on from the stands.Colombia lead Group D following their 2-1 win over Paraguay earlier on Monday. \nJames Rodriguez evoked memories of his breakthrough performance at the 2014 World Cup on Monday after the Colombia midfielder set up both goals in his team’s 2-1 win over Paraguay in their Copa America opener.The 32-year-old won the Golden Boot in Brazil a decade ago, his volleyed effort against Uruguay in the round of 16 still regarded as one of the World Cup’s best ever goals, but his career has been on a downward track over the last few years.After playing for the likes of Real Madrid and Bayern Munich, Rodriguez joined Brazilian side Sao Paulo last year, making it his fourth club in as many seasons.He played at Everton in 2020/2021 before being sold to Qatari side Al-Rayyan and then joining Olympiakos on a free transfer.However, the Colombia captain was the difference in Monday’s Group D game in Houston, Texas and was named Man of the Match.“I’m very happy, it’s important to start well today against a tough opponent like Paraguay,” Rodriguez told Caracol Gol.“We could have done better in the second half, but you correct things better when the team wins, it’s much easier that way.”More than 60,000 Colombian fans at Houston’s NRG Stadium gave Rodriguez a standing ovation as he left the field in stoppage time following a performance that has them hopeful of lifting the continental trophy again after a 23-year wait.“It’s beautiful, they are supporting us a lot. We have a long way to go in this Copa America and we’re taking it one game at a time,” Rodriguez added.Colombia next face Costa Rica on Friday before taking on Brazil four days later. \nItaly qualified for Euro 2024's last 16 with a 1-1 draw against Croatia, who are in danger of being eliminated despite Luka Modric's goal, while Spain topped Group B.\nSpain clinched a third straight Group B win in Euro 2024 with a 1-0 victory over Albania, securing their spot as group winners while resting key players.\nA battery factory fire in South Korea killed 22 workers, mainly Chinese nationals, after multiple explosions ignited a warehouse containing 35,000 battery cells.\nRussian guided bombs shattered an apartment building in Ukraine’s second-largest city on Saturday, killing three people, injuring 52 and prompting President Volodymyr Zelenskiy to call for more help to deal with the growing threat of such weapons.Pictures posted online showed parts of the five-storey apartment building in ruins, with windows smashed, balconies wrecked and rubble strewn about a crater on the ground.Prosecutors in Ukraine’s eastern Kharkiv region put the casualty toll at three dead and 52 injured in the mid-afternoon attack, including three injured children. Regional Governor Oleh Syniehubov said four of those hurt were in serious condition.“This Russian terror through guided bombs must be stopped and can be stopped,” Zelenskiy wrote on Telegram.“We need strong decisions from our partners to enable us to stop the Russian terrorists and Russian military aviation right where they are.”Later, in his nightly video address, Zelenskiy said Russian forces had used more than 2,400 guided bombs on Ukrainian targets in June alone, with about 700 aimed at Kharkiv.He said after US Congress gave delayed approval of a big aid package in April, Ukraine's replenished arms supplies had reduced the devastation and frequency of missile attacks and the same had to be done now to fend off these bombs.“The significant reduction in Russian missile terror against Kharkiv and the region proves it is entirely possible to secure our cities and communities from Russian bombs,” he said.Ukraine, he said, needed promised military aid packages “without delay so that the agreements we reached with (US) President Biden can be realised.”Ukraine and the US signed a 10-year bilateral security agreement this month aimed at bolstering Ukraine's defense against Russia and getting Ukraine closer to NATO membership.Russia has relied increasingly on relatively inexpensive guided bombs, dropped from a distance and involving fewer risks for its forces.Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022 and has advanced slowly through Donetsk region in the east, capturing a string of villages since seizing the key industrial town of Avdiivka more than three months ago.It launched a cross-border incursion north of Kharkiv last month, though Zelenskiy says the situation there has stabilised.In the latest bomb attack, Mayor Ihor Terekhov said there had been four strikes on Kharkiv.Regional governor Syniehubov said rescue work was proceeding at the building, which housed a store on the ground floor.Kharkiv Police Chief Serhiy Bolvinov told public broadcaster Suspilne that three floors had collapsed, but he believed no one was trapped under the rubble.Kharkiv lies about 30 km (20 miles) from the border with Russia. The city of 1.3 million people has frequently been targeted in Russian attacks during nearly 28 months of war.Moscow denies deliberately targeting civilians but thousands have been killed and injured in the war. \nProminent Bangladeshi-Swedish author Taslima Nasrin's books in Nepal, despite being unauthorized translations, have sparked concerns among publishers and literary figures, highlighting the prevalence of copyright violations in the Nepali book market, with unapproved translations of other international bestsellers also being sold.\nBharat Budha, chair of Putha Uttarganga Rural Municipality’s ward 10, knows that many youths from his village have made it to the United States via ‘tallo bato’—backdoor route—and that many are still on the way. He also knows that eight of them have been deported from the country and that they have lost a cumulative Rs45 million in the process. The deported youths say that they returned home empty-handed after facing unspeakable ordeals and lost Rs6 million each on average.The Tak village in Rukum East—a close-knit settlement of 425 houses—was considered the Maoists’ ‘base area’ during the insurgency. Village youths who reached the US through illegal routes and got deported have lost an estimated Rs40 million. The number of those who returned without completing the journey and the amount they lost remain unknown.To get to the US, the youths have taken loans at up to 36 percent interest per annum from their relatives and village landowners. In Tak village, at least one person each from half of the households has gone abroad, Budha said. “Youths started going to America about six-seven years ago,” he said. “If they could gather enough money, the whole village would try to go to the US.” Budha’s own son had reached the US illegally in 2017, spending Rs3.2 million.During the insurgency, outsize slogans of revolution would adorn the walls of houses in the village. Hoping for a better life, people from all walks of life helped out the Maoists. But now, village youths are paying the agents to illegally get to the US—a country that the Maoists used to call their ‘enemy’, an ‘imperialistic force’. This has cost the Tak village much and in multiple ways.Death of a dreamSome of the deported youths have chosen to flee the village altogether, burdened with debt and creditors’ pressure. At least five such families have already left, said a resident. The family of Ram Budha was one of them. On April 28, 2015, Ram, who had returned to Nepal after working in Malaysia for eight years, took the illegal route to the US. He travelled through arduous trails for months and finally arrived in the country. Upon reaching the country, he was detained and had to stay at the detention camp for 27 months. When his refugee application was rejected, he was deported to Nepal in mid-December 2019. He lost Rs4.5 million in the process. He now owes over Rs6 million to creditors. “After the creditors began to put pressure on me, I couldn’t live in the village peacefully,” said Ram, who currently runs a vegetable farm in Tarakeshwar, Kathmandu.While those who got to the US through illegal routes and fortunately got refugee status there narrate their stories with pride, those who have been deported or returned from half-way have tragic tales to tell.Nanda Kala Gharti, who lives in a small stone house on the upper flank of Tak village, spends her days in melancholy. Her husband, Dhanlal, had chosen to take the illegal route to the US, and Nanda Kala, a mother of four, is living with the repercussions of his decision. Dhanlal had got into the US after a six-month long arduous journey and was detained immediately. He had to spend four years in the detention camp, before he was deported to Nepal. He had already lost Rs6 million.Nanda Kala said they now have an insurmountable crisis in their hands. Pointing to her son, she exclaimed, “When will he grow up, go abroad and pay back the loans!”Dhanlal himself tried to go to Croatia once and spent 15 days in Kathmandu for the process. But after he was turned down, he returned home dejected. “Now we will submit the passport to another agent [for Dhanlal’s trip abroad],” Nanda Kala said. “There’s no point staying here.”Stories that echo each otherThe situation in Sisne Rural Municipality is similar to that of Putha Uttarganga. Here, one can hear plenty of stories of those who have tried to go to the US and those who are fighting refugee cases there. Krishna Regmi, chair of the rural municipality, personally knows seven people who have been deported from the US.Gangaram Khadka, a resident of Sisne-3, runs a bee and chicken farm. Like other young men in his village, Khadka had headed off to the US via an illegal route on 27 March, 2018. He had reached the US via the New Delhi-Moscow-Barcelona-Bogota-Panama-Costa Rica-Nicaragua-Honduras-Guatemala-Mexico route. When he finally arrived in the US, he was detained and had to spend 11 months in detention. He was deported on 15 March, 2019. He had handed over Rs3.2 millions to the agent and spent Rs2 million to fight the case to become a refugee. “It’s not possible for me to pay back the loan while working in Nepal,” he said. “I aim to pay back some interest and head off abroad again.”For six months after Khadka was deported, he had anxiety and headache, he said, adding the three people from his village who were deported like him are also struggling with their mental health.Tikaram Pun, a 40-year-old resident of Bohora village in Musikot-4, is also haunted by his past journey. In September 2017, he reached the US after crossing 17 countries with the help of organised human traffickers. Of the 41 people in his group, 31 were from Rukum East and Rukum West, he said. Pun, who was detained on arrival in the US, spent 24 months in a detention camp. His refugee application was also refused and so he was deported along with eight other Nepalis. “When I returned, I started having mental health problems. I still suffer from them,” he said. Pun is under pressure from creditors and relatives to pay back the Rs9.2 million loan he had taken for the task.Those who died on the wayA group of 10 Bangladeshis and seven Nepalis, including Rupak Bohora of Bafikot-3 in Rukum West, were on a mission to reach Costa Rica through Colombia, Caribbean Coast, Capuragana and Panama. But while they were crossing a sea, their boat capsized. As many as 12 died in the incident, including six Nepalis. Rupak’s wife, Geeta, learned about the incident only after six days, on 25 June, 2021.“I still don’t know what exactly happened,” said Geeta, who had been married off at age 19 and is now a mother of two daughters. The only thing she knows is that Rupak has died and she is now all alone. And that she has Rs5 million in loan taken for Rupak’s trip. She showed a picture of her husband on her phone to this scribe and said, “I only have memories.”Lack of political will and legal remediesThe concrete bridge over Chewang river is on the edge of Tak village. On the walls of the bridge are paintings of political theorists like Marx, Engels, Lenin, Stalin and Mao, and the iconic slogan, ‘Workers of the world, unite!’, below them. But the slogan appears to be at odds with life in the village. Given the phenomenon of illegal travels to the US through the help of organised human traffickers, the whole village appears to be emptying. Neither the local governments are concerned about the phenomenon nor are the political parties paying attention.Puniraj Gharti, chair of Putha Uttarganga Rural Municipality, said though the trend is worrying, there’s nothing he can do. “How could we stop them from making the trip when they are struggling to make a living in the village?” he said.Krishna Regmi, chair of Sisne Rural Municipality, said that the vicious cycle of poverty started after marijuana farming was banned in the country. Then the Maoist insurgency added to the woe, forcing youths to migrate. The signing of the peace agreement in 2006 didn’t herald any change in the economy either and youths are struggling to get jobs. Organised human traffickers are cashing in on this sorry state of affairs, Regmi said. “Meter byajis [usurious lenders] are also promoting this phenomenon,” he added.The phenomenon is equally rife in Dang’s Tulsipur and Ghorahi. Ramesh Kumar Pandey, chair of Ghorai-15, says that even though many heading to the US are swindled, no complaints are filed at the ward office. “Only those who attempt to go to Saudi Arabia or Qatar file the complaints,” he said.One can infer from Pandey’s statements that the families of such illegal travellers don’t want to publicise the ordeals of their family members. On the one hand, agents threaten them to not publicise the issue; on the other, they fear they themselves would be punished by law.According to the Anti-Human Trafficking Bureau, as many as 178 Nepalis, including 174 men, have been deported from the US in the five fiscal years after 2018-19. Of them, the highest 49 are from Rukum while 37 are from Dang. The data doesn’t include those who returned after making it to the half-way or those who have been fighting the legal battle in the US for refugee status. But this data is enough to show that many such youths are from the ‘base areas’ of the Maoist insurgency.SSP Jeevan Shrestha, chief of the bureau, said that data on the number of such victims and the amounts they have spent is hard to collect since complaints are rarely filed with the police. “This is human trafficking but for a lack of law, we are still compelled to launch the cases as per Human Trafficking and Transportation (Control) Act 2074 BS,” Shrestha said. “The Act provides a maximum penalty of Rs250,000 for the offenders and 50 percent of that as compensation to the victims.” Without specific law, police also invoke the theft and organised crime act to punish the offenders, he added.On the one hand, police receive no complaints; on the other, the phenomenon sees no control.Bhaskar Gautam, a political scientist, says the rise in cases of human trafficking in the insurgency’s ‘base areas’ is due to the political system’s abject failure.While the Maoists raised issues related to livelihood, nationalism and a new kind of democracy to fuel their war machine, after the peace process, it is livelihoods that have been hit the hardest, Gautam said. “The traditional way of life and economy took a hit during the insurgency,” he said. “Developments after the peace process also failed to address that. What sprang up was organised human trafficking.”(Mahesh KC in Rukum East and Durgalal KC in Dang contributed to this report.)This report is prepared in collaboration with the Center for Investigative Journalism-Nepal. \nGyanumaya BK had been suffering from severe backaches for a while. The resident of Pokhara-15, BK visited the Metrocity Hospital in Srijanachowk seeking treatment five months ago. The 69-year-old, who works as a labourer, has already spent over Rs50,000 on follow-up checkups and medications.BK spent eight days in the hospital in January and has been paying off loans she had taken to pay her bills and for follow-up visits to the hospital. Had BK been aware of the Health Facility Operation Standards-2020, which private hospitals must adhere to, she wouldn’t have had to borrow money to pay her medical bills. As per the regulations, hospitals must set aside 10 percent of their total beds to the underprivileged and needy.“I didn’t know hospitals were required to provide free treatment to those who can’t afford hospital stays,” BK said. “But even if I did, I would have to fight to get the service as the hospital won’t willingly offer me the service.”The Pokhara-based 50-bed hospital’s Chief Executive Officer Gyan Prasad Aryal admits that his hospital does not adhere to the mandate. “We don’t have explicit information from the health ministry on the Health Facility Operation Standards-2020,” said Aryal. “Moving forward, we will follow the instructions.” The hospital authorities say they give a 10-15 percent discount on the final hospital bill as opposed to dedicating 10 percent of their beds and free treatment and medications to the less privileged. Hospitals with 15 beds come under the jurisdiction of the local units while those with up to 50 beds fall under the ambit of the Provincial Health Directorate. Likewise, the Provincial Health Ministry oversees health facilities with over 50 beds.However, no regulatory body has data on whether health facilities are following government rules, especially Health Facility Operation Standards-2020. But it is an open secret that most private hospitals in Pokhara are not following the regulations.Pokhara Municipality Health Department Officer Yadunath Baral, Kaski District Health Officer Bhim Prasad Poudel, and Province Health Director Khim Bahadur Khadka all admit that local hospitals disregard the regulations. “Our monitoring and inspection is also lax, that’s why most hospitals ignore the rules,” he said. He says lack of manpower hampers effective inspection. “Our manpower is enough to conduct inspections in other districts, but not in Kaski, which has many private hospitals,” he said. “We need more people for that”. According to Baral, although the hospitals claim to offer a certain discount on final bills to the needy, they are unable to show the record of the discounts provided. “The hospitals claim they give discounts, but most hospitals have not even been able to show us the proof,” said Khadka. “Legal actions should be taken against the hospitals that fail to submit a monthly report on the free services for the poor. More importantly, they must be liable for flouting government standards that aim to benefit the poor.” The Provincial Health Directorate also does not have any data on the directive’s implementation at hospitals with more than 50 beds.The department’s chief of health services Dr Ramesh KC says that they have been working on updating information of health services in the Gandaki region. “Hospitals have failed to submit their mandatory monthly reports. We will seek that information when they come for new permits or permit renewal,” KC said. There are 27 privately-owned hospitals within the Pokhara Metropolitan City and 39 in the Gandaki region. Bharatpur Metropolitan City in Chitwan in Bagmati Province is also called the ‘medical city’  as it is home to 23 private hospitals with a total of 1,200 beds. Additionally, there are multiple large-scale government hospitals and two medical colleges—Chitwan Medical College and College of Medical Sciences—that also provide medical services. Had the Health Facility Operation Standards-2020 been followed by the 23 private hospitals, 120 patients would have received free health services every year, according to Durgadutta Chapagain, chief of the Chitwan Health Office.“Although the hospitals claim they provide the services, none have been able to provide convincing proof. Instead, we found them giving such discounts to patients who are close to hospital operators,” said Chapagain. “Our department validates the permits for new health facilities and re-registrations for hospitals with a 25-bed capacity. We have asked such public health service providers to put up posters or stickers reading ‘Discounts for the needy’ on the hospital premises so that patients know what services they can get on discount.”Meanwhile, Bikram Adhikari, Secretary of the Private Hospitals Coordination Committee in Chitwan, claims that the regulations are impractical. “There are a few services that hospitals can provide free of cost. You cannot expect hospitals to provide all services for free. That’s why there is a need to amend the existing regulations,” said Adhikari.The monitoring bodies’ inaction and lackadaisical approach to ensuring that public health services are accessible and affordable to all makes private hospitals blatantly ignore government mandates.Bharatpur Metropolitan City’s Deputy Mayor Chitrasen Adhikari says that although the metropolis is aware that private hospitals must allocate 10 percent of their beds for free treatment of poor people, the metropolis administration has yet to devise a monitoring mechanism. “We have not taken any steps towards that end, but we will soon,” he said.Just like Pokhara and Chitwan, Biratnagar is also plagued with the same problem. There are 32 private hospitals currently in operation in the metropolis. Deepak Bhattarai, statistical officer at the municipality’s health office, asserts that none of the health facilities met the set requirements. A monthly report submitted by the Biratnagar-based Nobel Medical College and Teaching Hospital, which has 750 beds, stated that the hospital had provided the said concession to more than 400 patients. “However, the report did not clarify how many of the 400 patients were provided free hospital beds and the services that come along with the beds, and how many were given discounts on their hospital bills,” Bhattarai said. “We found that hospital reports also include concessions provided to patients who sought outpatient, emergency, and X-ray services.”The hospital’s director Narayan Dahal claims to be following all government instructions. He says 10 percent hospital beds are set aside for needy patients who are not charged any treatment fees, while 10 percent of service seekers also get discounts.Although the Biratnagar Metropolis has directed all health facilities under its jurisdiction to allocate free beds and provide free services to the needy, inform service seekers about the government-provided services, and submit a list of all patients who have received the services, the directive is ignored more often than followed. According to Bhattarai, medical establishments must get a letter from the local unit before making any upgrades or purchasing any equipment. “But the hospitals have been found presenting fake documents in order to acquire such permits,” he said. “The metropolis has refused such permits to 12 private hospitals in the current fiscal year.”Butwal Sub-Metropolitan City in the Lumbini Province has also taken no concrete step to ensure private hospitals adhere to Health Facility Operation Standards-2020. Despite having the authority to carry out inspections, the sub-metropolis’ apathy has deprived hundreds of needy patients of various government services. The sub-metropolis with 17 wards has more than two dozen big hospitals in the Butwal bazaar area itself. Not one of them adheres to the government’s health regulations. But the sub-metropolis is yet to monitor these hospitals. Yubraj Pandey, chief of Butwal Sub Metropolitan’s health department, says they have been unable to inspect medical institutes due to a lack of a proper set of rules.“I have just been transferred here. Discussions are underway to prepare legal requirements,” he said. Private hospitals in Butwal only began filing their reports two months ago after a joint meeting, informs Chief of the Sub Metropolitan’s Education and Health Department Mitramani Khanal. Twenty-year-old Suraj BK of Sarawal Rural Municipality-2 in West Nawalparasi got into a motorcycle accident on April 26. He suffered injuries on both his legs and was taken to Zenus Hospital and Research Centre in Butwal. Suraj was handed a bill of Rs 70,000 for treatment but he did not have the money to clear the bill and sought the hospital’s help. “The hospital refused to provide any discount. They in fact refused to discharge me. I got my discharge papers only four days later after I paid almost Rs 100,000,” he said. “I had to get a loan to pay the hospital bills as my father, who is a farmer, did not have that kind of money.”Dr Sharda Singh, the hospital director, said Suraj did not qualify for a discount as he did not have a recommendation letter from the local unit. “Patients have to get a recommendation to avail of free services at private hospitals but Suraj could not bring one,” she said. “I was in the hospital bed for four days. I could not have secured a recommendation from the local unit in that state,” said Suraj. Ishwari Prasad Chapagain, a civil society leader of Rupandehi and a member of the Consumer Interest Protection Forum, says private hospitals in Butwal are more interested in making money than helping those in need. “They do not follow government mandates. They act as if they have to bear the expenses of providing free service to the poor when in fact they get tax rebates and such for such services,” he said. “The sub-metropolis also does not do the needful. Everyone is corrupt including the city officials.”  \nThe duel between Kathmandu’s 34-year-old mayor Balendra Shaha (popularly called Balen), a structural engineer, reputed rapper and political novice, and 72-year-old Khagda Prasad Sharma Oli, a high school dropout, two-time prime minister, political veteran and chairperson of the Communist Party of Nepal (United Marxist Leninist) is a caricature of contemporary Nepali politics marred by the conflict between the old and the young. The duel has attracted numerous newspaper articles, set social media on fire and provided YouTubers a field day. What is Oli’s motive in mobilising his whole party to attack Balen, and what is Balen—a lone man with no political experience and political following—doing picking a fight with Oli? How will the duel impact Oli’s party and Balen’s aspirations going forward? The fightThe Balen-Oli fight began when the metropolitan city started to clear buildings built illegally on municipal land or business advertisements that did not comply with municipal regulations. The city would order the current occupants of the offending buildings or business owners to comply with the law and vacate the premises. In most cases, the occupants would ignore the order. Like in old times, they relied on their political connections to continue to subvert the law. However, that did not work with Balen. He sent municipal forces to demolish the encroachment and non-compliant adverts. The first property subjected to the mayor's action belonged to someone connected to the UML. Soon after the clearance, a Central Committee member of the UML, Mahesh Basnet, called upon his minions to physically harm Balen if he did not “mend his ways”.Balen’s attempt to clean up Kathmandu from squatters occupying public land, particularly river banks, intensified the conflict. Oli publicly mocked Balen for using bulldozers to demolish plastic shades built by “poor squatters.” Some “squatters” are believed to occupy multistory buildings constructed on public land and own businesses worth millions of rupees. The majority of them are UML voters, “UMLs’ vote bank”, observed a Balen supporter. The squatter problem is not new. All previous governments, including the one led by Oli, recognised it. The conflict became increasingly acrimonious when Balen opened the basement of Dharahara for car parking. The government objected, arguing that the reconstruction of Dharahara is still incomplete and the car park is unsafe to use. Balen retorted, “Dharahara was inaugurated as a completed project by Prime Minister Oli before the last election. How can it be incomplete?” The inauguration of the work-in-progress was one of Prime Minister Oli’s pre-election charades. The car park is safe and currently in use; the reconstruction continues. The recent New Road imbroglio added fuel to the fire. Balen started widening the footpath on New Road to comply with the standards set by the Nepal Department of Roads (NDR). A local ward chair, a UML member, objected and complained to the Ministry of Physical Infrastructure and Transport headed by Deputy Prime Minister Ragubhir Mahaseth, an Oli acolyte. The NDR, which reports to Mahaseth, issued a “stop work” order. Incensed, Balen asked Oli to expeditiously arrange repayment for those who cheated the so-called Giri Bandhu Tea Estate land plotting scandal. Oli’s apparatchiks compared Balen to “a puppy” (a good-for-nothing weakling) and chastised him for maligning “our respected Chairman”. Oli himself has described Balen as a “bubble” which will fizzle out in no time. The fightersOli is old, witty, foxy, prickly, intolerant of criticism and, like all other politicians, corrupt in the public eye. As enunciated during his premiership, his vision of economic development includes building view towers, providing Kathmandu households with piped gas within six months, and building facilities for maritime trade—the latter two unachievable pipe dreams or political ploys. Balen is young, angry, ambitious, audacious, brash, bold, impulsive, focussed and untainted by corruption. His vision for Kathmandu is to make it a clean, functioning, beautiful heritage city. In about two years since he became mayor, Kathmandu has become relatively cleaner and greener. Its roads are rid of perpetual potholes; its sidewalks are walkable; teaching standards in public schools have improved; private schools who were short-changing on paying taxes have been forced to pay their share; emergency ambulance service has become more dependable, and so on. All of the above, despite a lack of support from political parties and the government. Parties do not support him because his success will spotlight their past failures. Despite the odds, his accomplishments have made him hugely popular throughout the country. “If we have ten leaders like Balen, we can change the country,” an exuberant Kathmandu taxi driver told me. Even the international press has taken note of Balen’s leadership. The New York Times published a story on Balen last year. He was named one of the 100 upcoming leaders in 2023 by the internationally known Time Magazine, published in the US. Balen’s public support is so visceral that he gets away even with outrageous comments like “burning Singha Durbar’, Nepal’s central secretariat, the office of Nepal’s Ministries, and irrelevant dragging of Oli into the “Giri Bandhu Tea Estate” scandal, and other similar outbursts. Although the overwhelming support for such comments on social media is surprising, it is indicative of the intensity of public dislike of established politicians.The future Balen knows that he owes his popularity as much to his performance as his refusal to bow down to political pressure and to stay clean from corruption scandals. In the two years since he assumed office, he has given confidence to the city dwellers that with exemplary leadership, the city and the country can be changed. His future depends on whether he can continue to ignore political pressure and demonstrate his perseverance, will, guts and vision to turn chaotic Kathmandu into a livable metropolis. As for Oli, UML lost the last election in Kathmandu because its mayor, a UML member, was a dismal failure. The confrontation with Balen for political upmanship and ego inflation will unlikely win Kathmandu for him. Cooperation may work better than confrontation.    \nOverhead bridges often become hangout spaces where people spend time observing the hustle and bustle of the city. Even in the small and noisy traffic island of Koteshwor junction, one can observe people resting and killing time. Similarly, plenty of people visit the open land of Koteshwor-Tinkune to play sports, and many more are there as spectators.These examples indicate the growing demand and potential for public spaces in Kathmandu.Having public spaces in urban areas has multiple benefits. Open spaces improve public health by providing space for physical activity and refreshment. They make places socially and economically vibrant by attracting people and activities. They serve as emergency shelters during disasters like earthquakes. If planned well, open spaces help in biodiversity conservation and groundwater recharge. However, the situation of open spaces in Kathmandu Valley is miserable. UN-Habitat recommends 15-20 percent of urban land for open public spaces. However, according to a report published by the Kathmandu Valley Development Authority, only 2.29 percent of the land was available as open space in 2012, and the condition has not improved. The irregular distribution of public spaces has also reinforced their unavailability. Advocates for urban public spaces recommend the availability of open spaces within walking distance, a 400-metre radius. However, many places in our cities do not have public spaces nearby, and even when they are available, they are usually gated and inaccessible.Public parks are confined within high boundary walls and gates. Shielding public spaces from the public is a paradox, although it is supported by common reasonings such as possible vandalism, waste littering and maintenance difficulty. As a result, we are undermining the value of public spaces.Similarly, unifunctional and exclusive planning approaches have also compromised the effectiveness of public spaces. Public parks designed for specific demographics, such as elderly people’s and children’s parks, have become a new trend. When this is not the case, the spaces still lack provisions for a diverse population: Women, children, differently abled and so on.Furthermore, ecological dimensions are rarely considered during the development of public spaces. Local hydrology, geology, biodiversity, and natural ecosystems are disregarded. Approaches like the plantation of non-native vegetation for mere beautification, a large proportion of hardscape, and the absence of stormwater management systems show a superficial approach to public space management.In addition to these issues, open spaces constantly threaten encroachment. Sometimes, encroachments seem like an act of conservation but end up with the controlled ownership of some individuals or groups. The Nepal Army’s occupation of part of Tundikhel is one such example. At other times, public spaces are intruded by building construction and infrastructural development. Despite all such challenges, urban public spaces can be enhanced in many ways.First and foremost, existing and potential open spaces should be identified; larger parks, khya (culturally significant open lands), urban pockets, riverfronts, traditional ponds, courtyards and other potential spaces should be mapped out and planned for. Encroached public lands should be reclaimed. As for new urban areas, the government should provide open spaces beforehand.After that, identified public spaces should be managed, with due consideration of their typology and context. Larger parks can be developed with a significant proportion of native greenery and diverse spaces such as sports areas, recreational areas, water bodies, and gardens. Basic services like public toilets and drinking water services should be arranged.Smaller spaces can be designed as urban green pockets. Machhindra Park near Jawalakhel is one good example. Cultural-communal lands such as Khya should be managed with minimal interventions.Riverside landscape can also be capitalised as urban public spaces. Some riverside parks, such as Sankhamul Park, have already demonstrated the use value of riverfronts. However, the custom of retaining wall boundaries and ornamental landscape disassociates the river’s relationship with the land and people. Therefore, riverside development that promotes biodiversity and ecological sustainability and strengthens people’s physical and spiritual relationship with water is essential.Next, we can capitalise on traditional open spaces like ponds and courtyards. For instance, ponds can be revitalised with proper pavements, seating spaces, and safety. Pim Bahal Pukhu at Patan and Nigu Pukhu at Thimi are perfect examples of traditional pond-based revitalisation that boosted the place’s socio-economic activities.Furthermore, creative strategies are required to transform unconventional spaces such as overhead bridges, sidewalks, bus stops, and traffic islands into appealing public spaces. For instance, a pedestrian bridge, beyond its functional use of crossing roads, can act as a lively space if upgraded with public space amenities. Greenery addition, shed, carved-out spaces for interaction, seating spaces, and artworks are a few strategies. Likewise, wide sidewalks can be transformed into green infrastructure networks constituting rest spaces, kiosks and drinking water fountains.Lastly, the most important step in public space management is to embrace the ‘Make it Simple’ design approach. This will significantly help tackle the issues of maintenance challenges, budgetary limitations and environmental degradation. Barrier concepts should be replaced with design and management solutions to resolve public space maintenance issues. Too many interventions and high-maintenance elements such as fountains, extravagant lighting and furniture can be intentionally avoided. Simple open ground composed of local vegetation, seating platforms, and minimal hardscape with durable materials like stones can also make beautiful parks. Providing open spaces is not enough in itself, though. For example, the Dharahara complex, although designed as a landmark public space, isolates itself from the surrounding context. Ultimately, public spaces should be physically well interconnected with existing urban networks to make them more accessible, practical, and contextual. \nNepali art exhibitions held in May-June 2024 at Kathmandu’s major galleries represent the diversity of the idioms of Nepali paintings executed in traditional, ethnic and modern forms. Visiting the exhibitions, closely observing the artworks, and interacting with the curators and some artists, I realised that the quest for the right idioms to express the major motifs of paintings continues to be the main thrust of the artists. In this article, I am alluding to the genre of paintings exhibited in galleries. I have attempted to review the paintings displayed at the exhibitions and briefly discuss the diverse modalities and practices of exhibitions, as well as the impact of audience-oriented activism. Though I have been writing on the diverse genres and forms of Nepali art like sculpture, architecture and installation-oriented works mainly curated in Nepal by Sangeeta Thapa through major events under such rubrics as “biennale and triennale”, I have mostly produced reviews of paintings over the decades. I have put my review writings in catalogues and journals. In recent years, I have been writing articles on art for the academic journal Sirjana of the Sirjana College of Fine Arts. Navindra Man Rajbhandari, an artist, art teacher, curator, and pedagogue, has been working earnestly to edit and publish this journal. I visited the painting exhibitions in the major galleries—two at the Nepal Art Council, Babarmahal and one each at the Nepal Academy of Fine Arts and the Siddhartha Art Gallery. Interestingly, all these exhibitions are audience-oriented. The painting exhibition practice often follows the rituals of cataloguing the works with simple introductions and price tags written somewhat half-heartedly. They also mention the mediums used by the painters, like oil, water, gouache and, very commonly, acrylic. From the early artists who were exposed to Western art to those of contemporary times in Nepal, all use the same mediums as artists anywhere in the world. These mediums are the universal shapers of the idioms of paintings. Nepali painters use the above-mentioned mediums and other admixtures according to their modern training and indigenous painting traditions. The evolution of colour paintings, especially oil, marks the presence of the audience or the clientele of paintings; it has become a commonly recognised subject. All came through modern education in art. Artists’ emotions and the consonance of cultural and aesthetic factors are commonly represented in such paintings.One eloquent example was seen at an art exhibition, “Deities of Nepal II”, held at the Nepal Art Council in May-June 2024. This exhibition, principally curated by the art academic Swosti Rajbhandari Kayastha, presented some remarkable paintings and their projection modalities. The diversity of the paintings executed according to the overt and covert themes of sacrality had one common element. Their choice of colours and hues and their delineation to create the exquisite beauty of the mythopoetic figural of the characters in the paintings was one eloquent feature. Modern painters also treated the divine figures and their aura in their non-figural works. I especially liked the modern techniques in these paintings about the deities. The thrust was experimental. Some artists, comparatively, made very good paintings; others were just cliché works, naturally. However, the common strength and feature of all the paintings that featured the iconography was what the brief brochure text says: The composition of “the deities intricately woven into a tapestry of philosophical and spiritual beliefs.” The other was the search for an appropriate style for projecting the spiritual motifs. The paintings appeared to establish a covenant with the audience, this time through a pricing pattern. Paintings were liberally priced; some were priced up to Rs4 million. And the remarkable matter was that some of these expensive paintings were “sold” to Nepali buyers. We should remember that the paintings were sold as works of art, not as pictures of religious iconographies. The entry of the modern audience into Nepali paintings is what matters here. John Berger, a great art critic, says that the painting itself should generate the buyer’s desirability through its touchable and visual attraction. I saw this covenant at this exhibition. The next display was the “National Exhibition of Fine Arts 2024”. This one presents a different perspective in my collection several decades’ glossy catalogues of the Nepal Academy of Fine Arts. This exhibition, curated by Devendra Kumar Kafle, aka Thumkeli, its member secretary, and other departmental academy members, presents a unique view of Nepali art. Kafle guided me through the variety of artworks and described the collection methods. The collection is based on the modality of sampling artworks of Indigenous and regional features and bringing them out to the national exhibition, which is a remarkable activity. The Academy has published small glossy catalogues for them. In his note, the Chancellor of the Academy, Naradmani Hartumchali, says this is a culmination of such exhibitions in all seven states. He stresses the need to bring art to a level where indigenous forms could be made a topic of political significance by evoking such features as representation and social transformation. I don't know of any well-researched discussions on this important topic initiated by any authentic institutions. But the exhibition speaks for itself. The current exhibition, “Threads of Simultaneity”, organised by ‘Sirjana 2024’ and mainly curated by Navindra Man Rajbhandari, exhibits 200 pieces of artwork executed by 28 artists at the Arts Council. Artist Rajbhandari revealed that the exhibition was an attempt to project a historicity of a combined nature of art activity shared entirely by the academic cohort of the institution. The exhibition features some works of the erstwhile principals Sashi Shah (2001-11), Krishna Manandhar (2011-17) and Madan Chitrakar (2018-22), and members of the Sirjana College of Arts like Vatsa Gopal Vaidya and other senior artists associated with the college one way or the other. Works of the young and senior artists are on display. I also want to recall yet another unique exhibition organised by Siddhartha Art Gallery, “Sawari Kathaharu: Art in Motion”, in May 2024. The concept of motion in art is presented by creating the art of motion, as in Ralph Lily Turner’s “Storms”, Hokusai’s “Great Waves”, Pablo Picasso’s “Guernica” and Sashi Shah’s “Darting Horses”, to take a few examples. Capturing the fixed images mounted on darting objects like vehicles and exhibiting them in a reputed gallery is designed to showcase experimental works and their appeal.May and June 2024 were eventful in the realm of Nepali art. I was struck by the variety of motifs and styles that show the performative mode of Nepali paintings. \nIn yet another instance of the Nepali society failing to provide a safe space to women, a 16-year girl was raped in Panchadewal Binayak Municipality in Achham on Monday. The victim was staying in a chhau goth, or menstrual shed, at her maternal uncle’s home when she was violated by her distant relative. After years of awareness campaigns and the breaking of chhau sheds by central and local governments as well as non-governmental agencies, the victimisation of women remains a daily occurrence in several parts of Nepal, especially Karnali and Sudurpaschim provinces. The chhaupadi system was outlawed by the Supreme Court in 2005; in 2017, it was made punishable by up to three months in jail or a fine of Rs3,000 or both. But the inhumane practice remains deeply rooted in parts of Nepali society. While reports of extreme cases come from the hinterlands, menstrual taboo rules the roost even in the sophisticated drawing rooms and kitchens of urban centres. Impurity runs in the psyche of the average Nepali; menstrual blood simply oils the juggernaut of superstition, patriarchy and misogyny that is Nepali society.As disturbing as the news of the rape is the report that the victim’s relatives tried to conceal the incident. After all, this is a society whose so-called honour lies in the private parts of a woman. If it cannot save the woman from predators, it must hide the fact that it could not save the woman. From celebrating and defending rape-accused celebrities to punishing victims for speaking up, this society fails women each day. Just consider how unsafe this place is for women who have to suffer the indignity of chhau in this day and age. Cold, rain, wild animals, serpents or asphyxiation do not even come close to the danger they face from men. The tragic irony is that the woman who becomes “impure” or “untouchable” inside the home remains an object of desire inside the chhau shed. Consider how many cases of sexual assaults might have been brushed under the carpet in the name of family honour. Every night a woman has to spend in a chhau shed should count as the death of the conscience of Nepali society.Gauri Kumari Bayak and Amba Bohara and her two children were killed in 2018; Parbati Bogati and Parbati Budha were killed in 2019 in menstrual huts; and the list goes on, the tragedies returning each year. How many women must be raped and murdered before the society goes beyond the “shame” and “honour” dichotomy and considers women equal humans? How many seminars, constitutions and movements does it take for the state to be able to create a safe space for women? The society and the state must answer. Until it can guarantee safety and dignity to the women, the Nepali state might want to keep the national flag half-mast. After all, one-half of the flag belongs to the women, who make up half of the country's population.  \nThe Nepali cricket team is returning home today after a bittersweet performance at the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup 2024 in the US and the West Indies. But at the same time, it has sent an unmistakable message to the world: “We have arrived!”Nepal technically did not win any of the group stage matches at the world cup. The only point it got was through a draw with Sri Lanka after rain forced the match to be abandoned. The match with Sri Lanka was certainly the most anticipated considering how they were a relatively weaker team in the group and Nepal had a great chance of getting both the points. But Nepal was not out there looking for the weakest. Rather, it was there to take on the strongest cricketing giants. In the other three matches—against the Netherlands, South Africa and Bangladesh—Nepal gave its opponents ample evidence of its arrival on the global cricketing scene. The most electric performance, of course, was against South Africa when Nepal lost by just a run. But even in the narrow loss, it won plenty of hearts and accolades, having forced a top Test cricket-playing nation ranked third in one-day internationals and fifth in T20 internationals to run for its money. Neither could the Netherlands and Bangladesh take Nepal for granted. What was equally gratifying was the forceful presence of Nepali cricket fans cheering for Team Nepal. The Nepali fans did not only fill the stadiums from Texas to Florida to St. Vincent, they cheered on even as their team lost. This was not just due to a strengthening spirit of sportsmanship but also the confidence that we are rising and rising as a cricketing nation. At home, though, there is still a lot of work to do. The men in blue and red might want to work on their batting skills, for that is where we flattered the most this time. After assessing their World Cup odyssey, captain Rohit Paudel and coach Monty Desai will certainly sit down to work out a new plan of action, and we must have faith in their leadership—after all, Nepali cricket hasn’t been as consistently strong as it is under them. What we need immediately is investment in infrastructure. We do not even have a single stadium with floodlights, let alone proper stands and toilets for the spectators. The stadium in Kirtipur is rustic and amateurish at best; the one in Mulpani is taking ages to complete although it has been used for some tournaments; and the one in Bharatpur that has been partially built by the Dhurmus-Suntali Foundation has a long way to go before it comes into operation. Moreover, our players have limited exposure to even regional cricket although we live at the nervecentre of the cricketing world—South Asia. Nepal must take the initiative to invite regional cricketing powerhouses such as Afghanistan, Bangladesh, India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka for friendly and competitive matches so that our players get greater exposure. We have seen how Afghanistan has risen as the dark horse of cricket in just a few years with the right kind of regional support, mainly India. We stand to be the next big story in the cricketing world if we play our shots right.  \nWhile countries worldwide are forging ahead on an electric future, Nepal is still struggling to set clear plans and policies in the field. The government’s 10 percent tax hike on electric vehicles (EVs) for the fiscal year 2024-25 comes as a tight slap to the country’s commitment to EV-based mobility by 2030—at a time green transport systems across the country feel ever more important. For this or that reason, consumers here are obliged to line up for a whole day, if not days, to fill up their motor tanks. In a recent case, the underpaid fuel station workers halted fuel supply to private dealers and thronged the state-run stations in Kathmandu. These occurrences are here to stay, reminding us of the need to take the EV transition seriously. It is widely known that promoting EVs offers multiple benefits. The transition to electric vehicles in Nepal will not only reduce vehicular emissions and clean the air but also discourage the country’s overreliance on fossil fuels, which account for more than 17 percent of the total import bill. This shift, in turn, can help us leverage our under-tapped hydropower potential to build charging stations and export electricity to the two closest neighbours transitioning to green policies. EVs are costly to install, and concerns about insufficient charging stations in Nepal remain, but they are still more efficient and cost-effective than petrol or diesel vehicles. Nepal will also benefit from increased climate funds in the long run if we successfully make air breathable by cutting vehicular emissions through EV adoption. After all, Nepal must have a moral ground and track record of actions to negotiate for these funds and can’t always fall back on the excuse of the country’s negligible contribution to greenhouse gas emissions. What policymakers seem to be overlooking is the urgency of EV adoption. Their plans and policies on electric vehicles are ambiguous as, on the one hand, they pledge a green energy future while, on the other, they agree on building oil pipeline projects with India. Moreover, they always set ambitious goals and fail to achieve them. For instance, by introducing the Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC) in 2016, the government aimed to increase the share of EVs to 20 percent of all passenger vehicles; however, by 2020, only 1 percent were electric. Now, when people are more interested in buying these green wheels due to the tax cut on EVs last year, the new tax increment is bound to affect their choices. These developments are setbacks to meeting net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2045 and decarbonising the transport sector by 2030.It’s high time to come up with clear policies on green growth and execute interventions that wholeheartedly support electric vehicles. This includes installing charging stations and finding ways to sustain them by emulating international practices on repurposing, recycling and managing used batteries. Many organisations, donor agencies and development partners are extending their hand to Nepal in this effort. Failing to establish clear strategies and imposing tax restrictions could mean missing out on the benefits these agencies can provide and the overall change electric vehicles can bring to Nepal. The green energy goal is worth pursuing collectively, as no less than the future of humanity depends on it. Nepal as a responsible global actor must do its bit.  \nThe government’s recent decision to recall ambassadors, particularly Nepal’s envoy to India, just ahead of Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal’s visit to New Delhi, courted widespread controversy. What are the takeaways of the prime minister’s Delhi visit? What is the progress in implementing the trade and transit agreement signed with China and with the BRI projects? Thira Lal Bhusal of the Post sat down with Rupak Sapkota, foreign affairs advisor to the prime minister, for some insights.The government’s decision to recall ambassadors from 11 countries at once has come under heavy criticism. Why did the government take such a decision?In general, it has become a practice of sorts to recall incumbent ambassadors and appoint new ones after changes in the government or in the ruling coalition. This has both merits and demerits. The country’s foreign policy doesn’t change with a change in government. But every government and coalition has its specific policies, programmes and priorities. Therefore, even other countries make changes in political appointments as per the government’s priorities. Our case is a bit different. Ruling coalitions are frequently changed, and so are ambassadors. As there is a high chance of our politics being governed by coalitions given our electoral system, it has become necessary to establish a rational system on ambassadorial appointment. Either the political appointees themselves should voluntarily quit the job and return home just like vice-chair and members of the National Planning Commission do. Or there should be a consensus among major political forces to allow our ambassadors to serve out the full term.The second option of allowing ambassadors to serve out their term sounds better, doesn’t it?Definitely. Some initiatives have been taken with the objective of making our diplomatic appointments more prestigious, merit-based and better-managed. The government in 2019 introduced some criteria on ambassadorial appointments. We have to put more effort into ensuring that our ambassadorial appointees have the capacity to effectively carry out diplomatic duties. Once we establish a system of appointing envoys based on merit and not out of political biases, we can create a situation of allowing them to serve for the full term. Then, a change of coalition wouldn’t affect their continuity. We need to develop such a political consensus, given our geopolitical sensitivity.But the ambassadors appointed in recent years and their activities in host countries have lowered the bar of our diplomacy.We have seen rapid and huge changes in power equations in the world. In view of that, we can see some countries have appointed former ministers and even prime ministers as envoys to the countries with whom they have vital relations. They also appoint such personalities as envoys for a special mission. So, we have to think about ambassadorial appointments from different perspectives based on the changed context. It is high time that all the political forces and leaders agree on a basic point that those who have in-depth understanding and expertise of the field and can work for the best interest of the country will be appointed the country’s ambassadors. If the individual is competent, the person’s affiliation to a political party may not be a problem. But whether the person can work in the best interest of the country must be considered before appointment.But the government itself doesn’t seem serious about maintaining diplomatic decorum. For instance, the June 6 Cabinet meeting decided to recall the ambassador from India just days ahead of the prime minister’s New Delhi visit. There were also reports that the prime minister made the decision reluctantly due to pressure from coalition partners. What is the real story?It is nothing more than a coincidence. There were discussions about making changes in the ambassadorial positions in line with the March 4 changes in the ruling coalition. But it was deferred as the government needed to accomplish some important tasks and convene events such as the investment summit. When the government decided to change our ambassadors, it just happened to coincide with the prime minister’s visit to New Delhi to attend the swearing-in ceremony of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. It was a coincidence. Despite the decision, the ambassador had sufficient time to properly conclude all his engagements and duties there. The way he facilitated the process during the prime minister’s visit doesn’t reflect any misgivings about the government’s decision. So, it should be taken as a course that is in keeping with our tradition. In recent decades, other countries have given top priority to economic diplomacy, but the selection of our envoys and their activities doesn’t reflect that. Why aren’t we thinking in that direction?Yes, diplomacy in the past used to be one-dimensional, or it was conducted mainly by one particular ministry—the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. These days, many other ministries are engaged with international agencies. Economic diplomacy, labour diplomacy, climate diplomacy and security affairs have become crucial. We have to increase coordination, cooperation and collaboration among relevant agencies to make our international relations more fruitful and in line with the policies and goals set by our government.We have seen profound changes in terms of approaches, perspectives and dynamics of diplomacy in recent decades. All countries have started to give more importance to the competence of diplomats also in view of the increased geopolitical competition and rivalry seen between world powers. Rapid innovation in science and technology has not only eased our lives but also added challenges. We have to handle so many diplomatic engagements. Similarly, the number of international forums where we have to engage are increasing. These days, multilateral diplomacy and engagements have become as important. Even minilateral forums have started to play vital roles in international relations as the world powers have adopted multiple strategies to create their spheres of influence. In the meantime, the role of public diplomacy has become influential. So, a diplomat today must be dynamic and efficient enough to grasp the international situation, understand the sensitivity of the host country, articulate our country’s views efficiently and work in national interest. Therefore, it has become vital to be extra careful while selecting ambassadors.You talked about better coordination but we don’t see any correction in the practice of bypassing the foreign ministry while working with international agencies.Definitely, the foreign ministry is our focal point for all international relations conducted by a ministry or agency of our country. There should be no dispute about that. We need to make the foreign ministry more resourceful. Then, the ministry will have more capacity and efficiency to handle issues related to security, finance, labour and climate.Why have we failed to maintain reciprocity in terms of diplomats’ relations with the leaders of host countries? For example, our ambassadors in some capitals don’t get to meet the host leaders for years while the foreign envoys in Kathmandu can meet our prime minister and foreign minister directly and instantly.We have to see it from two perspectives. One is the power structure. In international relations, we can see the reflection of the asymmetric power relations between the big powers and other countries. The more developed and resourceful country’s influence in a host country can be seen and felt. Second, despite being an envoy from an underdeveloped or a small country, one can have diplomatic relations based on the principle of sovereign equality. It depends on the individual diplomat as well.In Kathmandu, we often err when dealing with foreign envoys. We have to decide what level of importance to give them. Therefore, some initiatives have been taken to correct and maintain consistency by implementing a diplomatic code of conduct that aims to integrate all activities through the foreign ministry. Foreign envoys will follow the system if we implement it consistently, irrespective of changes in the government. For that, there should be a political understanding at the national level.Let’s move to Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal’s recent India visit. Though it was mainly to attend the swearing-in ceremony of Indian Prime Minister Modi, he held some important political meetings. What are the takeaways from the visit?The visit was important from bilateral, regional and international perspectives. Traditionally, foreign affairs was described as an extended form of domestic affairs. But these days, international affairs have influence over domestic affairs as well. So such meetings and dialogues at the prime minister’s level are important. They exchanged views in a very cordial atmosphere. Of late, we have maintained bilateral dialogues at the political level on a regular basis and that has helped remove misunderstandings. Our prime minister’s emphasis is to hold bilateral dialogues both at the political as well as diplomatic levels in order to settle differences. India has taken this spirit positively.Second, the two prime ministers discussed how to expedite the implementation of the agreements reached between Nepal and India during Prime Minister Dahal’s official visit a year ago. The issue was discussed during the meeting between Prime Minister Dahal and Indian External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar as well. They also expressed satisfaction over progress in the implementation of bilateral agreements mainly in energy trade, connectivity and investment. In recent years, we have seen progress in investment, economic and trade sectors. Yet we still have some differences on border issues. That is an important and positive development in Nepal-India relations in recent years. In the past, when we had some differences on political, border or other issues, that used to badly affect other aspects of our relations. But now, both the countries agree to resolve outstanding issues through dialogue and our trade and all other affairs are moving ahead smoothly. This is the encouraging part of our relations. But border disputes can sour our relations anytime, right? Is there a sense of urgency to resolve it once and for all?The prime minister is for activating the concerned bilateral mechanisms to resolve such issues. He has also invited Indian Prime Minister Modi to visit Nepal. We can expect the Indian prime minister’s Nepal visit in near future. We can make some progress in resolving some outstanding matters such as border issues during the high level visit. I believe we will move ahead in this direction.Any progress on submitting the report of the Eminent Persons’ Group?During the meetings, the prime minister raised overall bilateral issues that include the matter related to the EPG report. I think once the mechanisms are activated and start working, that will create a situation for the report’s submission.Nepal and Bangladesh are completing homework for greater energy trade. India’s facilitation is a must for that. Is there any progress on securing the southern neighbour’s support for that?Progress in energy cooperation is a major achievement of this tenure of the prime minister. The progress is not limited to the bilateral level but goes to the regional level. A Cabinet committee of the Bangladesh government earlier this month approved a proposal to import 40 megawatts of electricity from Nepal. At present, we will use India’s infrastructure to export energy to Bangladesh. But for the long term there is a plan to build a dedicated transmission line for that. This shows it is not only Nepal that is interested in exporting its energy but other countries in this region are also interested in importing Nepal’s electricity. We have also signed an agreement to build a cross border transmission line with China. The doors are being opened for regional trade of our energy. This development will make India more open to importing energy from Nepal.Why are we failing to expedite projects under the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) of China?The economic cooperation between Nepal and China has substantially increased after we joined the BRI framework. So, Nepal has been benefitting from the BRI. We see some concern about the lack of progress on certain infrastructure projects to be built under the BRI framework. In fact, we are in a better position to implement the projects because now we can decide what kind of BRI projects are good for us based on the experience of project development and implementation under the BRI in other countries.We are working to finalise the BRI implementation agreement. Nepal wants to move ahead by signing the implementation agreement and developing the projects. Nepal joined the BRI framework based on its need to diversify trade and connect to the world market. The reality is the same now. So, we need to sign the implementation plan and move ahead as soon as possible. When I attended the Boao Forum a few months ago, I found the Chinese authorities and other stakeholders holding debates to build quality and resilient infrastructure. They also have plans to support the capacity enhancement of human resources and transfer technology in the BRI member countries.People mainly link the BRI with big infrastructure projects such as railway, road and transmission connectivity but there is no significant progress on these fronts. What are the roadblocks?In Nepal, no big infrastructure project has been completed on time, be it the Melamchi drinking project, airports, hydropower or road projects. We haven’t developed the capacity to build big projects, and we don’t envision any plan to operate after building it. So, not only with China but also with other countries and agencies, we have to seek support for small and medium-size projects that we can efficiently build and operate. Also, the third version of the BRI action plan has included building not only big but small and smart projects under the framework. We have to push for that. As we build our capacity, we can gradually take up big projects. For instance, now we can build big hydro projects on our own. It wasn’t the case until some years ago. We developed expertise in hydropower by building many small projects in the past few decades and gradually enhanced our capacity. We have already faced problems in operating the Pokhara and Bhairahawa airports. Is there any progress in taking Chinese support to operate the airports?We have to see both aspects—domestic as well as international use—of the airports. The two airports have helped us upgrade the quality of our domestic air travel as the passengers have benefited due to the upgraded infrastructure. The number of domestic passengers in these airports has increased significantly.It is true that there is no progress in terms of operating them as international airports. The government is studying all possibilities of their use based on their unique features. We are exploring various options in international markets to attract adventure tourists to Pokhara. Chinese stakeholders are also holding some promotional activities in Pokhara. Chinese authorities have told us that they are consulting with their provincial bodies and exploring possibilities to run regular flights to Pokhara. Similarly, the government is mobilising our embassies and other stakeholders in certain countries having a large number of Buddhist tourists to operate flights to Bhairahawa, and we have received some positive responses. I believe we will be able to operate regular international flights from these two airports soon.It’s been eight years since we signed the trade and transit agreement with China, which was touted as a historic deal between the two countries. Why haven’t we been able to implement it?Some symbolic steps have been taken in this period. For instance, a shipment was received from a third country [Vietnam] using a Chinese port in September last year. Similar other initiatives have been taken but these are limited to symbolic gestures. We have to prepare infrastructure and some legal basis to implement the agreements in a more result-oriented way. A bilateral meeting is being held this week. The meeting is likely to discuss how to bring the trade and transit protocol in an effective way. This meeting will discuss various issues faced so far and will also pave the way forward. We have also proposed to form a ministerial-level mechanism to oversee overall bilateral issues. The upcoming meeting will sort out various issues.The Chinese side was conducting a feasibility study of the Keirung-Kathmandu cross-border railway project. What is the progress?There is progress in various projects that we are carrying out with Chinese support. The cross-border railway feasibility study is in the final stage. Likewise, the study on the Chhahare-Tokha tunnel project is ongoing. A Chinese team is arriving to conduct a feasibility study of the Hilsa-Simkot road. A process to award a contract to build a friendly bridge at Hilsa with Chinese grants has begun. A foundation stone will be laid there soon. Also, a study to build the Chilime-Rashuwagadhi-Keirung 220kV cross-border transmission line is beginning soon. \nThe government has decided to make the National ID Card mandatory in order to receive services from government and public institutions. In the first phase, the June 6 Cabinet meeting made the National ID card number mandatory in 28 districts. People including federal lawmakers criticised the decision saying that it was enforced without first distributing the cards. In this context, Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal sat down with Yubaraj Katel, director general of the Department of National ID and Civil Registration.Let’s begin with a basic question. Why do we need a National ID card while we already have citizenship certificate, driving license, passport and voting card?There is a fundamental difference between a citizenship card and National ID. Citizenship establishes whether you are a citizen of the country and it helps you identify yourself with some basic details. In Nepal, it was also widely used as a service card. Wherever you go, you have to show the citizenship card—to open a bank account or acquire a SIM card for a phone. If we study international practices, there are mainly two cards—one is an identity card and the other is a service card. In 2018, the Nepal government came up with the idea of distributing national identity cards with a unique digital number for each eligible citizen. The number can track not only the individual but also the person’s activities and movements. This project has various components. First is data collection. It has two categories—demographic data, such as the names of father, mother and other family members. Second is biometric data—fingerprints, eye retina and digital signature. The biometric data is crucial to create a unique identity of each individual and avoid duplication in the integrated national database. The National ID has these two types of data. The other tasks are enrollment of the data, printing and distribution of the cards and then providing services based on that. At present, people carry multiple cards in their pockets. The objective of this project is to replace all of them by a single card–National ID. The new card includes vital details of all other cards in its chip with 1GB storage capacity. The government wanted to trace people based on their unique individual numbers so that there is no need to print and carry multiple cards. There is a huge industry of printing separate cards for each and every service that is creating a jumble of information. The National ID will not only replace multiple cards but also help authorities control criminal activities like financial frauds by removing duplication. At present, government authorities have difficulty in tracing and identifying an individual and wrongdoers are benefitting from that situation.What cards will be replaced by the National ID?It has a chip with 1GB storage capacity where you can store your driving license, academic documents, voting card, insurance details, ATM card number, etc. For instance, if you go to a telecom company to acquire a SIM card, they will ask for a copy of your citizenship card. You can say, ‘no, I have a National ID card’. Once you give your number and fingerprint, they can immediately verify it through the system. Another objective is to help people get rid of filling up pages of forms for each service. International governance has a norm that says don’t ask citizens their information more than once. A state agency should seek the information once and provide it to other state agencies if they require it. People complain that many agencies don’t accept National ID. They still ask for a citizenship card for official record and verification. So, in practice, it didn’t help people reduce the number of cards in their pockets. In fact, it added one more.Therefore, the June 6 Cabinet decision made the use of National ID cards compulsory in 28 districts. Now, it is going to be essential to get social security allowances, pensions and claim health insurance. The Health Insurance Board has said it has become challenging for them to verify whether a claimant is the rightful one. The board has 8 million policyholders. We will give them our details. Then, they can cross-check the authenticity of a claimant. This will help avoid huge financial frauds. In fact, the government should have made it mandatory earlier.But people including lawmakers in the federal parliament have strongly opposed the decision saying that the government made National ID mandatory without first distributing the cards to the people.Nepal’s total population is over 30 million. Our principal stakeholders are citizenship card holders. Those 16-year-olds are eligible for citizenship cards. The Election Commission distributes voting cards to those above 18 years. We got the data from the commission and added 20 percent and estimated that we have 18.6 people above 16 years old. As of Friday, we have already distributed the National ID numbers to 14.9 million people. Now, as per our estimate, around 3.7 million people are yet to get the National ID. Millions of people are abroad. Thus, we are headed towards saturation point in terms of data collection and issuance of the numbers. One thing I want to stress is that people don’t need a hard copy of the National ID card. The number is sufficient. Printing cards is costly. We have to pay around 2 euro to procure a blank card. The cost of printing, delivery and other overhead expenses is added to that. With the task of printing over a billion copies of ID cards being too costly, even India discourages use of hard copy of the cards. You can create the QR code of your card, save it in your mobile or print it in a paper and scan it wherever you need it.Officials at our government agencies bring up the rule that makes it mandatory to present a physical copy of citizenship card or other documents for official works.Yes, we are trained and habituated in that way. Now we need to change. We must make offices paperless while developing a strong database system. We have been using citizenship cards to verify the identity of a person for a long time. Biometrics not only helps identify people but also trace their activities. Recently, Rs2 billion was found in the bank accounts of a 26-year-old man. The money was deposited in 56 bank accounts. He used 13 ATM cards and 17 phone numbers. Once the National ID card is implemented, transactions and movements of such wrongdoers will be easily traced and monitored. Identifying individuals accurately is crucial to ensure good governance and strengthen security. Many people have acquired fake citizenship cards. People even made fake passports. Implementation of National ID will control it. It is also related to our national image. It will help improve the status of our passport and add authenticity to our other documents as well.Once the National ID comes into wide use, our details will be traced and used by multiple agencies. State agencies and other institutions benefit from the integrated database as they can easily trace us. But how do you ensure our data isn’t misused and it doesn’t make us insecure?If you have a National ID card, you don’t need a hard copy of your driving licence. There is a backlog of around 2.1 million licences. The government has failed to print and distribute them. We told them, we have already procured 12 million cards. Of them, 3.2 million cards have already been printed and we still need to print around 8 million cards. Once the licence data is integrated with the National ID card, it will be shown there. Now, to come to your question, only the traffic authority can access the licence-related data. The device they use will trace only relevant data. Only an authorised agency will get access to the data and it can’t be used for anything other than the stated purpose. We give access to agencies like Nepal Rastra Bank, Nepal Telecommunication Authority and Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal. Then they regulate the things in their domain. No unauthorised body or individual can access it. Do the implementing agencies have infrastructure to use this technology?We are in a position to implement it in some parts of the country. Therefore, we are implementing it in phases. We are making it mandatory for certain services in 28 districts from mid-July. We should have started much earlier. It must be expedited.Lawmakers said in a Parliament meeting that the decision has ‘terrorised people’ in the 28 districts as locals feared they might be deprived of the services as the government has made National ID cards mandatory without first distributing them.We started the National ID registration process from 2018. Registration teams reached in each local ward except in Mugu and Humla districts of Karnali. It was carried out as a campaign. Even after the drive’s completion, the registration process was open in all the 77 districts, 54 area administration offices and in palika (local unit) centres. We also had registration centres in major downtowns. We receive data of around 4,000 registrations a day. So, there has been sufficient initiative and enough time to encourage people to get the number. Besides, if anyone in the 28 districts are still to get the ID number, they still have three months to register.You said only an ID number but no hard copy was needed to access any kind of service, right?Exactly. There is no provision that states one should produce a hard copy to get any service. You give the number and your biometrics to verify that you are the right person. Then, the official can crosscheck it in the database within seconds.Do all the implementing agencies have the devices that read the National ID cards?We have distributed 4,200 machines that read the cards in 333 local units of the 28 districts. Likewise, we have asked other local units and districts and some agencies such as banks to procure the devices and we have given the specifications based on their requirements. A device costs just around Rs 1,500. You can enter the number and place your thumbprint on it. We have trained relevant officials from all the local units for the purpose.How many cards can the department print at present?We can produce 1,500 cards an hour. But now we are producing only 1,800 a day. We have the strength to distribute 30,000 cards a day but are distributing only 5,000 a day.Again the same question. Then why are people not getting the cards?There is some communication gap. People who registered in 2018 or 2019 haven’t contacted us. We are giving them priority to clear the backlogs. But people who are newly-registered are showing more interest. So, we need to strike the right balance.When will the department be in a position to distribute the cards to all the people?At present, we can print 100,000 cards a month. We have a space to double the capacity. Meanwhile, people have now shown more interest. By enhancing our facilities’ capacity, we can print the pending 8 million cards in the next 40 months.What about election cards? Do we need to register for that and get the voting cards?In fact, the Election Commission doesn’t need to collect data and issue cards. We will talk to them. As a constitutional body, we have to readily make the data available for them. In fact, the National ID Card system can help the commission make voting arrangements for the Nepalis abroad because it can accurately identify the right person and can immediately update the integrated system here in Nepal about the votes cast in any country. This card will be helpful in conducting fair elections because the biometric data stored in this system will be perfect bases to identify the people and instantly update the activities in the database.You have emphasised replacement of other cards by the National ID cards. How long may it take to do so?We plan on giving priority to three sectors—banking, civil aviation and telecom. People right now need to fill separate forms for these services that have irked the service seekers. We have asked the bankers to buy the devices. We as a supplier are ready. Now the stakeholders should be ready too. It will benefit them because it helps control frauds.What if I don’t register for the National ID card?In the first place, you will be deprived of social security funds, pension, insurance policies. Likewise, the government will gradually make the card compulsory to receive many other services such as driving licence, land transaction, telephone numbers, bank accounts. How do you assure that our data stored in this system isn’t misused?See, the current practices make you more vulnerable. Because multiple agencies take your data for various purposes. Do they have a system to protect the data and ensure that it isn’t misused? But when your data is stored only by a dedicated government agency, it will be more secure as the agency is specialised for that. When other authorised agencies seek data, we give them access only to the relevant one. We have a National Identity Management Information System (NIMIS). We have maintained three layers of security—L1, L2, L3—to ensure foolproof security of the data. There are three servers.Are we dependent on any foreign company for any related service?So far, only one international vendor is involved but we are cutting down its involvement as well, with a plan to ultimately replace it by our own agency. The vendor now helps transfer collected data to the printing machine through the Automated Biometric Identification System (ABIS). But our plan is to do so through our own government agency or local vendor. We do all the other tasks. Security printing is done within the office basement where every movement of people is monitored and recorded. \nPrithvi Subba Gurung, deputy general secretary of the CPN-UML, is one of the leaders who strongly lobbied for a federal system while the Constituent Assembly was writing the constitution between 2008 to 2015. Eight years after the adoption of the federal democratic republican constitution, the federal system, particularly the provinces, are widely being criticised for their supposed failure to deliver. The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal asks former Gandaki chief minister Gurung what went wrong in the course of implementing the federal system.The implementation of the federal system has faced several hurdles since its adoption. Most provinces have for months failed even to form the governments, let alone run them efficiently. Where is the problem?We have adopted a federal system but are working against its spirit. Provinces should run autonomously. On some key issues, federal leaders and the party’s central bodies may give some direction to their provincial bodies. But most provincial activities are still centrally-governed even years after the adoption of federalism. So, our practices aren’t in line with the system. The provincial governments shouldn’t have been affected by the changes in the federal coalition. Such problems were seen in India years ago. But they have learned from their experience. In our case, leaders of major political parties treated the provincial governments as party chapters. The provincial governments are formed and run as per the constitution and all the three tiers of the governments are autonomous. The high commands in our political parties aren’t ready to accept the new constitutional setup.Are the provincial leaders equally responsible as they seek Kathmandu’s nod before taking any important decisions?They seek the centre’s support because they are trained in that way. They are too dependent on the centre. You said India learned by experience and now provinces there work more autonomously. But, in Nepal, provinces are now witnessing more problems than during their first tenure, which is evident also in the difficulties in government formation in multiple provinces. Why couldn’t they learn from the five-year experience?Nepal’s leaders and political parties are still not committed to federalism. They have failed to implement the federal system as per the spirit of the constitution. This is the major problem. The big parties as well as their leaders are guided by a centralised mindset and still prefer working in a unitary system. We should not forget that we transformed the executive and legislative bodies into three tiers of federal systems. But our judiciary retained the old structure. Therefore, the judiciary doesn’t accept the federal system and its practice in a true sense. Its verdicts reflect the same.The role of Speakers and Province Heads has courted controversies in multiple provinces. The top court invalidated some of their decisions. Is it because of lack of clarity, faults in our constitutional provisions, or is it because of the leaders?Speaker and Province Head are political posts created in accordance with constitutional provisions. When overall politics is dirty and unhealthy, those taking up these responsibilities also feel compelled to resort to similar tactics. When overall politics improves, they automatically make better decisions. Mainly there is no leader in the high command who completely owns federalism and is determined to implement it in its true spirit. This government in its policies and programmes unveiled last month had rightly said that “protecting federalism and strengthening the federal democratic republic is our top priority”. But the budget failed to introduce programmes as per the promises made in the policies and programmes.How do we correct these anomalies? Where do we begin?We are in a complex situation. Many have started to float the idea of making amendments to the constitution. But we shouldn’t forget that various forces and stakeholders had their own positions during constitution-making. They made compromises and found middle grounds to promulgate the constitution. If we go for amendments, they all will return to their respective stances. Some may want to revive the Hindu Kingdom while others will stand against it. Some leaders even within Nepali Congress have started to advocate for constitutional monarchy. But we can’t regress to the monarchical system. We can’t renounce secularism and an inclusive democratic system. We can’t backtrack on our commitment to a socialism-oriented system. We may explore some changes in our electoral system or form of governance without going against these key features of our constitution but we can’t destabilise the charter. What are the major flaws to be fixed?There are some. For instance, provinces have no role in education. The responsibility of education up to secondary level is given to the local level. And, everything is controlled by the federal government. The local units are entrusted with key responsibilities such as developing curriculum, overseeing the issues of career developments of teachers and staffers and their promotion as well as transfers etcetera. Local units can’t do all of these things efficiently as they have their own limitations. How can a local unit transfer a teacher from Kaski to Lamjung? Provinces should have been given such responsibilities. The power has been centralised at Singha Durbar. Such is also the situation in other sectors.Though the proportional representation (PR) system is hailed as one of the most beautiful features of our constitution in terms of ensuring inclusion, it has also been blamed for political instability. Many have demanded revision in the electoral system.The major political parties such as the CPN-UML and Nepali Congress have not trained their party members on the proper implementation of key constitutional features such as federalism and electoral system. The party members and general people have either wrongly understood it, or have negative impressions about the systems. These systems were adopted with an objective to resolve our decade-long conflict and address the concerns of the historically marginalised communities and even mainstream some groups through an inclusive democratic system. The idea was to integrate all the communities and maintain unity in diversity. After holding years-long debates on various options, we agreed on the mixed electoral system so as to reflect our diversity in the state agencies.As the proverb goes, “the bad workman blames his tools”, our leaders are blaming the system for their failure to secure a majority by winning people’s trust. Many countries that practise similar electoral systems have progressed. Our electoral system and the form of governance are not causing political instability. Many countries have adopted a parliamentary system and many others have practised the presidential model. Countries have progressed in both the systems. Also, there are examples of failures under both setups. So, the problem lies in our political parties and leaders, not in the systems. Shouldn’t political parties like the UML and Congress work with a plan to secure a majority by winning people’s trust? They aren’t training their focus on that but blaming the system. At times, they have squandered the majority as well and have failed to keep the party intact. Isn’t it our [leaders’] failure?Some argue that the issue of the fractured mandate can be addressed by increasing the threshold ceiling for political parties to be eligible to get PR votes and that can be done by amending election laws. Does it help?This is the idea coming from big political parties because they get more votes when fringe parties disqualify for PR votes. But a higher ceiling may deprive many small parties from representing certain communities. So, this goes against the spirit of inclusion. What we need is a good coalition culture. If we see the trend of recent decades, Indian politicians have become much more mature in this context. In the past, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi accommodated his electoral alliance partners in his ruling coalition even though his party won the majority single-handedly. If we scrap the inclusive electoral system, won’t the marginalised communities again revolt? We should be careful about that.At times, leaders have helped dissident groups split their party. These are the same leaders who issued an ordinance to change the provision that required a group within a political party to show support of 40 percent members of the party’s central committee “and” the parliamentary party. Only then could it split. They changed the threshold to 20 percent, and the “and” provision had been changed to “or”. The provision of requiring 40 percent support on both sides had earlier been included to ensure political stability. But the leaders who are helping party divisions are blaming the system for instability in the country. So, we [leaders] have to mend our ways, not blame the system. The Rastriya Swantantra Party, the fourth-largest in the lower house, has officially said that it wants to overhaul the federal system and drastically downsize the provinces. Also, leaders within the major parties who earlier stood in favour of federalism have started criticising it. On Saturday, Congress General Secretary Gagan Thapa said the country can’t sustain the provinces in their present form. What is your view?I am one of those who advocated for a federal system even before the first Constituent Assembly because Nepal is a country full of discrimination based on caste, class, region and religion. We advocated for the system to do away with these discriminations and find a system to maintain unity within diversity. Federalism is the best system to promote national unity as all groups get their own space as per their unique features. For instance, if you make multiple rooms in a building, you can give space and adjust more people. But if you keep many people inside a big room, they will have difficulties—no matter how big the room is. We should strengthen the federal system. We can’t regress.Then, why do many people see provinces as a burden?In Nepal, the federal system was projected as a structure that resulted in huge liability to the state coffers. But the facts don’t substantiate it. A local unit in the federal structure replaced many erstwhile Village Development Committees (VDCs). For instance, in my home district of Lamjung, eight palikas covered the areas of 61 VDCs, and the expenditure of the current eight local units is no more than that of the erstwhile 61 VDCs. Now we don’t need 77 district coordination committees. They can be scrapped. No province needs more than seven ministers. Likewise, the federal Cabinet can be drastically downsized. Why do we need a 25-strong Cabinet at the centre when we already have seven other provincial cabinets? Twelve ministries are enough at the centre, as suggested by the high level commission on administration reform.There are many departments and divisions that were designed under the unitary system that have become completely redundant in the federal setup. So many project offices established over two decades ago based on the needs of that time are still there. These irrelevant bodies should be scrapped. This is how we can significantly cut down on administrative costs. Leaders and people don’t discuss that. They only blame provinces. \nAmidst allegations of cooperative scams involving Home Minister Rabi Lamichhane, the Nepali Congress's Jiban Pariyar explains the culmination of weeks-long negotiations to establish the terms of reference for a parliamentary committee to investigate the matter, emphasizing the inclusion of relevant parties and depositors' interests.\nAmnesty International's Secretary General observes a global decline in human rights protection, citing shrinking civic space, weaponization of laws, impunity, populist authoritarianism, and the threat of unregulated AI and spyware, urging the Nepali government to improve transitional justice, address excessive force by police, and release the imprisoned media owner, while advocating for climate justice and international support for Nepal's vulnerability to climate change.\nRainfall and thunderstorms predicted across Nepal, with heavy rainfall likely in Koshi, Madhesh, Bagmati, and Gandaki provinces.\nPartly to generally cloudy weather with heavy rainfall in Koshi, Bagmati, and Gandaki, light to moderate rainfall expected countrywide, and continued rainfall throughout the night brings relief from the heat.\nSunday's weather forecast predicts partly cloudy skies with chances of light to heavy rain, thunder, and lightning in various provinces, and Nepalgunj recorded the highest temperature of 38.2 degrees Celsius.\nPartly to generally cloudy weather and light to moderate rain with thunder predicted for Koshi, Madhesh, Lumbini, hilly Bagmati, and Gandaki regions of Nepal.\nThe Meteorological Forecasting Division has forecast partly to generally cloudy weather in Koshi, Madhesh, Bagmati, and Gandaki provinces, as well as the hilly regions of Lumbini.
