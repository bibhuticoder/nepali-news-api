Write it in the form of inspiring story not news article or event.\n    \n    Story:\nOnce upon a time, nestled between the towering peaks of the Himalayas and the lush jungles of the Terai, there was a country named Nepal. Though still a developing nation, Nepal was a land of profound beauty and deep-rooted cultural heritage. The residents of Nepal faced many challenges, but beneath these hardships lay a resilient spirit and an unyielding hope for the future.\n\nThis enchanting land, where Mount Everest reaches towards the skies and the air carries a mix of incense and cool mountain breezes, was more than a geographical marvel. It was a mosaic of cultures, languages, and traditions, a testament to human endeavor against all odds. Nepal's history, from the unification under King Prithvi Narayan Shah to its transformation into a federal democratic republic, told a story of aspiration and endurance.\n\nIn recent years, the people of Nepal, with their indomitable will, had taken strides towards rebuilding and reimagining their country. They turned their struggles into stepping stones, each challenge a chapter in their ongoing saga. The shift from a monarchy to a republic had not only changed governance but had woven a new tapestry of democratic values and collective decision-making.\n\nEconomically, while agriculture continued to sustain a large part of its population, Nepal had begun to harness the potential of its picturesque landscapes, developing sustainable tourism that promised to preserve their natural heritage while boosting local economies. Communities living in the shadows of the Himalayas had become stewards of the earth, protecting the biodiversity that made their country unique.\n\nEach day brought new stories. Whether it was a festival in Kathmandu, a technological advance in Pokhara, or a conservation effort in Chitwan, these events were threads in the vibrant quilt of Nepali life. These stories, updated daily, reflected the pulse of progress and the spirit of hope that characterized this resilient nation.\n\nAnd so, as Nepal moved forward, each moment was not just a passage of time but a promise of potential, a narrative of a nation perennially climbing towards tomorrow, guided by the legacy of its past and the dreams of its future.\n\nNews events:\nNepal and China have agreed to issue five-year entry and exit passes for people in 15 districts of northern Nepal abutting China. After incorporating Chinese feedback, the Department of Immigration, under the the Ministry of Home Affairs, has recently redesigned the entry/exit pass and come with an operating procedure, which was first approved on June 19 by the ministry. The new arrangement, which is in line with the bilateral agreement and immigration regulations, will allow Nepali citizens living near the Chinese border to enter and exit from China’s Autonomous Region, Tibet, states one of the objectives of the operating procedure issued by the government.Nepali citizens living in northern districts who depend on Tibet for trade, pilgrimage, work, health checks and other daily activities, have long been complaining of hassles in visiting Tibet due to lack of mandatory passes.However, this arrangement was suspended after the onset of Covid pandemic at the end of 2019. And after China started reopening 14 traditional entry points, some local units on the Nepali side started issuing temporary “China Departure and Entry Permits” locally. Now, to streamline the entry and exit permission, the Department of Immigration is all set to issue digital passes to residents of the 15 districts. However, Nepali citizens from other districts will need a visa to enter Chinese territory.According to the operating procedure, the 15 districts where the passes would be distributed are Taplejung, Sankhuwasabha, Solukumbhu, Dolakha, Sindhupalchok, Rasuwa, Dhading, Gorkha, Manang, Mustang, Dolpa, Mugu, Humla, Bajhang and Darchula.Those 14 dedicated trading/entry/exit points between Nepal and China are Tiptala (Taplejung); Kimathnaka (Sankhuwasabha); Falak and Lapchi of Dolakha; Tatopani and Gumba of Sindhupalchok; Lazing and Chhekampar (Gorkha); Korala of Mustang; Hilsa (Humla); Nakcha (Mugu); Maringla Bhanjyang (Dolpa); Urai (Bajhang); and Tinkar of Darchula district. According to the Department of Immigration, the entry pass will, however, not be issued immediately in Solukumbhu, Dhading, and Manang districts due to ongoing adverse weather conditions. “A decision has already been made to issue digital passes. It is in the implementation process,” said Koshahari Niraula, Director General at the Department of Immigration. “Necessary instructions have been given to the immigration and district administration offices for implementation.”Before 2007, Nepali and Chinese nationals from border districts could travel up to 30 kilometres inside each other’s territory without restrictions. However, in January 2007, both sides reached a new agreement under which an identity card with one year validity was made mandatory, said noted cartographer Buddhi Narayan Shrestha. Now, both sides have developed a digital identity card. Nepal and China first entered an ‘Agreement on Trade and other Related Matters between the Tibetan Autonomous Region (TAR) of China and Nepal’ on September 30, 1956, which was last renewed on July 10, 2002. The agreement says those wishing to travel to the other country must hold valid passports issued by the sending country and a visa issued by the receiving country. Inhabitants of the border districts shall hold exit-entry passes with photo-affixed ID cards for border trade, pilgrimage and to visit relatives and friends, according to the agreement.Shrestha said those with the entry/exit passes are not allowed to travel beyond the border districts into the interior of the other country.“Generally, the limit is 30 km from the borderline. And those with permits for pilgrimage can travel through the designated routes and allotted entry points. They are not permitted to stay in the border districts of the receiving country for more than a month. Either party has the right to refuse entry into its territory of anyone deemed persona non-grata,” according to Shrestha.A senior foreign ministry official confided to the Post that the Chinese side initially expressed some reservations about the proposed operating procedure, particularly the issuance of five-year passes to Nepali citizens in the 15 northern districts. They had also called for making the passes digital.After considering the Chinese request, the foreign ministry official said that the home ministry had redesigned the new pass, revisiting some conditions that were initially proposed.Niraula said the Chinese side has agreed to issue the pass for five years. “With their consent, we have finalised and issued the new operating procedure.”According to one Home Ministry official, the ministry and the Department of Immigration agreed to incorporate biometric security features into the pass, as requested by Chinese officials. The new pass with biometric information is intended to curb illegal and criminal activities across the Nepal-Tibet border. The five-year pass will be issued exclusively to Nepali citizens living in the 15 border districts, their siblings, and those who are married and living permanently in these districts.Also, those who have migrated from other districts and are now permanently living in these 15 districts are eligible for the pass.However, if someone gets married and migrates to another district, they will not get the pass.To obtain the entry pass, one should fill out a form and provide required documents including a copy of the citizenship, a recommendation letter from the ward office, a migration letter if the service seeker has migrated from another district, a marriage certificate (for those coming from another district after marriage) and a passport-sized photo, according to the operating procedure.After verifying all the documents and information, the immigration office issues the permit, said the work plan. In case a district does not have immigration office, the service seekers should visit the district administration offices to receive the pass.“The permit is not transferable and will remain valid for up to five years from the date of issuance. Once it expires, one should reapply. If the card is lost or destroyed, the same process should be followed to get a copy of the permit,” according to the operating procedure.Madav Sapkota, a CPN (Maoist Centre) lawmaker from Sindhupalchok district, lauded the development and said it will benefit the people living in bordering districts.“The process was started when Pushpa Kamal Dahal was the prime minister, and now it is set to be formalised. Earlier, the Chinese authorities would issue one-year entry permits, and after Covid, they limited it to a day-long pass. If the entry process is simplified further, it will benefit the citizens from both sides even more,” said Sapkota. \nMinister for Education, Science and Technology Bidya Bhattarai is continuing her predecessor’s efforts to curb politicisation in the education sector.During an interaction with journalists on Wednesday, the minister said she has started consultations with top leaders from various parties for their commitment to prevent political interference in schools and universities. Bhattarai stated that partisan interference is a major factor responsible for the degradation of the entire academic sector, and that she is actively working to stop the malpractice.“I had invited the general secretaries from different parties to discuss the matter. Except for the Nepali Congress, whose general secretaries did not attend citing busy schedules, I did have discussions with those from the CPN-UML and the Rastriya Swatantra Party,” she said. “Although we could not reach any conclusion, discussions have at least begun. Politicisation will not stop without strong political commitment against it.” She also informed that she was working on an education reform plan by incorporating inputs from political parties. Bhattarai, a UML leader, became the education minister in the Oli Cabinet on July 15.Her predecessor Sumana Shrestha had started efforts to reduce politicisation in the academic sector, particularly teachers and professors involved in party politics. Her actions, however, were criticised by the top leaders of all major parties—the Nepali Congress, the UML and the CPN (Maoist Centre). Soon after assuming office, Shrestha had sought information from the Election Commission and district education units on teachers and professors affiliated to political parties.The initiative was taken as per the Political Parties Act, 2017, which prohibits teachers, professors and government employees from engaging in politics. Similarly, the Patan High Court on October 5, 2021 had ruled that schoolteachers cannot engage in active politics. Responding to a writ petition, the court said those drawing salaries and benefits from state coffers should not be involved in partisan politics.As per her claim, a total of 825 teachers across the country voluntarily resigned their political party memberships during her tenure as the minister. She had also claimed that 20 teachers associated with political parties resigned after the ministry started taking actions against the party-affiliated teachers.Politicisation in the academic sector has been further fuelled by partisan influence in school and university appointments, as well as sharing of crucial university positions among political parties.Only last week, Bhattarai had publicly requested Minister for Home Affairs Ramesh Lekhak to ensure security at the Tribhuvan University amid a dispute over an appointment.The dispute emerged when Kusum Shakya, Dean of the Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences, nominated Tikaram Gautam for appointment as head of the Department of Sociology although Pasang Sherpa was senior than Gautam.As per the university records though both Sherpa and Gautam are associate professors, Sherpa had joined the university four years earlier. Nepali Congress students at the university, however, wanted Gautam to be the department head. A leader of the Nepal Students’ Union, the sister wing of the Congress party, had threatened physical action against the university’s vice-chancellor, rector and registrar if Sherpa was appointed over Gautam.The university authority, following the threats, refrained from going to their offices and wrote to the education minister asking for security. Minister Bhattarai, subsequently, made a public request to the home minister for security arrangements.  \nNepal and the United Kingdom have signed two separate memorandums of understanding (MoUs) related to approximately Rs6.5 billion in grant support.According to the Ministry of Finance, the first MoU pertains to the Resilience, Adaptation, and Inclusion in Nepal (RAIN) programme, with funding of £38.5 million (approximately Rs6.5 billion), while the second concerns the Samartha programme—Enhancing Gender & Human Development Outcomes Through Systems Strengthening—with £38.8 million in support (approximately Rs6.58 billion).“These programmes are aimed at strengthening the capacities of local governments and communities most affected by climate change, as well as building human capital and improving the delivery of basic services in Karnali, Lumbini, and Madhesh provinces,” the press release issued by the Ministry of Finance stated.The agreement was signed by Dhani Ram Sharma, joint secretary at the finance ministry, and Pippa Bird, development director and deputy ambassador at British Embassy in Kathmandu, at a programme organised in Kathmandu on Wednesday.The RAIN programme is a six-year initiative to be implemented by the Ministry of Home Affairs (MoHA) and the Ministry of Forest and Environment (MoFE) to strengthen disaster risk management and climate change adaptation. It will be implemented in Karnali, Lumbini, and Madhesh provinces.Similarly, Samartha is a seven-year programme designed to enhance the systems and capacities of provincial and local governments to expand access to and deliver quality social services, with a particular focus on the education and health sectors. It will be implemented by the Ministry of Education, Science and Technology (MoEST) and the Ministry of Health and Population (MoHP), the release stated. Samartha will operate in the Lumbini and Madhesh provinces.Speaking at the signing ceremony, Sharma said that the programmes will be crucial in advancing Nepal’s socio-economic landscape, with a particular focus on sustainable development goals (SDGs).“This cooperation will be crucial in advancing Nepal’s socio-economic landscape, with a particular focus on SDGs and the objectives outlined in the 16th Periodic Plan, including social services, climate resilience, and human capital development,” he said.Likewise, Bird affirmed the UK’s continued support for Nepal. “These programmes will build resilience to natural disasters and climate change and improve the delivery of basic services to the most vulnerable,” she said. \nTime is ripe for banana farmers' business. Having sold Malbhog bananas, a highly popular variety, farmers are harvesting William's hybrid and Grand Naine (G9).But, despite their busy time, farmers of the cash crop are compelled to travel to Kathmandu just to ask the government why they are not getting the insurance amount for the losses they incurred in May.Since Saturday, farmers have been in Kathmandu to claim insurance amounts. On May 31, strong winds over two days destroyed bananas planted on a large area of land in eastern Chitwan. Madhav Ghimire, president of the Chitwan Banana Producers Association, said the storm damaged bananas worth Rs150 million.The farmers’ association claimed it was the worst loss they had ever borne.\"Officials from the insurance companies came to the affected areas and made a report. But it has been months, and they have not released the insurance payout.\"While banana farmers have insured their crops and have not received the claim, insurance companies are hesitant to accept premiums for the new crop. Most of the farmers in Chitwan said they are in a dilemma. \"We are in Kathmandu to settle these two crucial issues,\" said Bishnu Hari Panta, a former president of the association. \"We met with the agriculture minister and the secretary on Sunday.\"\"If farmers remain in the dilemma, how can they grow [the crop]?\" He said that despite paying the insurance, farmers are not getting the compensation. “And if the companies are hesitant to insure the crop, it will put every farmer on the brink.”Experts say climate change is making storms more intense and devastating. Storms, hailstorms, droughts, and floods are also increasing in Nepal and are considered major climate-related disasters.According to the National Climate Change Survey 2022, released by the National Statistics Office, the economic losses on-farm and off-farm sectors in the last five years, excluding significant infrastructure damages, amounted to Rs415.44 billion.The survey report said that drought had been reported as the major disaster, affecting 65.4 percent of households, followed by diseases and insects at 54.3 percent, storms at 46.2 percent, hailstorms at 32.6 percent, floods at 28.5 percent, cold waves at 21.7 percent, landslides at 21.5 percent, and inundation at 17.5 percent.Farmers in Chitwan lament the government’s policy on insurance.On Monday, the group of farmers also met with officials of some insurance companies and the Nepal Insurance Authority at the agriculture minister's quarters. Ghannath Mahato, the association's immediate past president, has a banana farm in Jagatpur that was less affected by May’s storm. His insurance term, too, ended in mid-July or by the end of the last fiscal year, and he needs to renew it for the new fiscal year. \"But insurance companies are reluctant to insure my crop,\" said Mahato, who is a part of the delegation. Since March 14, non-life insurance companies have stopped settling claims for insured farm products after failing to receive government premium subsidies.“I am worried. If the storm, which is frequent in Chitwan, damages my crop, I will be at a huge loss,” he said. “This is the time to spend in the field, but we are knocking on the agriculture minister's door with our grievances.\"In Chitwan, banana plantation covers 3,500 bigha (2,370 hectares). Most of the plantations are in the eastern part of Chitwan.According to the association president Ghimire, they usually get insurance payout late. “Last time, it took 13 months to get the insurance. We are not sure how long it may take for this one.\"Crop insurance was introduced in Nepal with much fanfare. The government formulated directives for crop and livestock insurance in January 2013.Under the scheme, the government provided a 50 percent subsidy on the premium in the first year and raised it to 75 percent in the second year.The premium subsidy was again reduced to 50 percent and raised to 80 percent in 2021. Currently, the government bears 80 percent of the insurance premiums, and the farmers bear the rest.When the insurance scheme started in 2013, there were 802 claims. In the previous fiscal year, the annual claims reached 36,000.Insurance companies say the government has not released the insurance premium amount, so they cannot settle it. \"The agriculture minister has assured us we will settle the issue as soon as possible,\" said Panta. The premium for banana crops has been fixed at Rs275 per tree. In case of loss, the insurance company pays up to 90 percent of it.\"If a farmer planted Malbhog bananas on a biga of land, the insurance premium costs Rs30,339,\" said Panta. \"The farmers have to pay Rs6,070, and the government pays Rs24,269.\" \nWithin hours after President Ramchandra Paudel authenticated the bill to amend the Enforced Disappearances, Enquiry, Truth and Reconciliation Commission Act, the international community welcomed Nepal’s efforts to take the nearly two-decade-long peace process to a logical conclusion.Issuing a joint statement in Kathmandu on Thursday, the United States of America, Switzerland, Australia, the United Kingdom, Norway, Japan, Finland, the European Union, Germany, and France welcomed the bill passed by both houses of the federal parliament.They expressed commitment to explore possible mechanisms for support to Nepal for the benefit of the victims and expressed belief that the continued participation of the victims in decision making processes will aid the effective implementation of the Act.“While we are in the early stages of the process, in order to assess possible future actions, the undersigned look forward to hearing from the Government of Nepal about specific needs to support effective delivery by the Truth and Reconciliation Commission and the Commission on the Investigation of Enforced Disappeared Persons,” the statement read. “Now is the time for all stakeholders to band together in support of bringing this segment of Nepal’s history to a successful conclusion.”President Paudel authenticated the bill earlier in the afternoon. Ending nearly a decade of confusion, the House of Representatives passed the bill on August 14, followed by the validation from the National Assembly on August 22. It was forwarded to President Paudel after Speaker Devraj Ghimire certified it on Wednesday.With the President’s authentication, the bill will come into force once it is published in the Gazette.However, a group of victims, human rights activists and organisations in the country, while welcoming several progressive provisions in the bill, had been demanding revisions in some of the provisions. Dozens of victims even staged a sit-in at New Baneshwar, near the Parliament premises, demanding necessary changes in the provisions that they claim undermine the quest for justice.Their appeal went unheard as both houses of the legislature passed the bill without making any changes. Along with some victim’s groups from the 1996-2006 insurgency, three international human rights organisations and the National Human Rights Commission expressed their reservations to some provisions of the bill.The constitutional human rights watchdog is particularly unhappy with the provision of reducing 75 percent sentencing even in serious violations of human rights. It allows the attorney general to lodge the case demanding just 25 percent of action as per the existing law.The peace process began with the signing of the Comprehensive Peace Accord in 2006 that ended the decade-long Maoist insurgency in the country.Other tasks of the peace process including integration of Maoist combatants and management of the arms of the former rebels were accomplished years ago but the responsibility to serve justice to the conflict victims remained unfinished. \nPresident Ramchandra Paudel has authenticated the bill to amend the Enforced Disappearances Enquiry, Truth and Reconciliation Commission Act on Thursday in accordance with Article 113 (2) of the Constitution of Nepal.Ending nearly a decade of confusion, the House of Representatives passed the Bill on August 14, followed by the validation from the National Assembly on August 22. It was forwarded to President Paudel after Speaker Devraj Ghimire certified it on Wednesday.With the President’s authentication, the Bill is now legally validated and ready for implementation once it is published in the Gazette.The amendment to the Act was necessitated after the Supreme Court in February 2015 struck down provisions that allowed amnesty for serious violations of human rights, directing the government to make necessary revisions. Despite this directive, successive governments until recently made no serious attempts towards changing the law as directed by the top court.The serious visible efforts to this effect was seen when the chiefs of the major three parties on July 1 formed a three-party panel to find a common ground on the contentious provisions in the bill. With consent from the top leadership the mechanism on August 7 reached a written agreement on the bill.Based on the three-party agreement, the Law, Justice and Human Rights Committee of the lower house approved the bill, which was under consideration for over a year, the very next day. The erstwhile Pushpa Kamal Dahal government had in March last year introduced the bill in parliament. It was under consideration for more than a year following differences among the parties on the content until last week’s agreement. \nPrime Minister KP Sharma Oli on Thursday handed over the cash prize to the women’s volleyball team players who participated in the CAVA Women’s Volleyball Nations League-2024.Captain Aruna Shahi and 14 other players received Rs300,000 each at a function held at the prime minister’s residence in Baluwatar. Head coach Jagdish Prasad Bhatta received Rs200,000, while Assistant Coach Bharat Yadav, Manager Nilam Singh Bajracharya and Physio Lokendra Kunwar were honoured with Rs120,000 each.Nepal finished as runner-up in the tournament held on August 1-7 in Kathmandu.On August 15, a Cabinet meeting had decided to provide a total of Rs4.76 million to the players and officials. Prime Minister Oli expressed his happiness over the women’s volleyball players’ success so far and urged them to work hard to set a new record in the coming days, the prime minister’s secretariat said.“I am confident that our players are encouraged to succeed and progress. The government will do its best to provide continuous training and motivation to the players and infrastructure,” said Prime Minister Oli. \nThe Nepali government appoints Ek Narayan Aryal as Chief Secretary, replacing Liladevi Gadtaula, who made history as Nepal's first female in the role.\nPost-monarchy (2008), Nepal has been governed by political parties (Big Three), amidst public discontent, with the 2015 constitution establishing a federal democratic republic despite shortcomings and dissident factions within parties leading to new outfits that have yet to challenge the dominance of established parties.\nOn the night of August 25, in six separate incidents in Pakistan, the Majeed Brigade, a guerilla group of the Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA), launched an attack code “Operation Herof”. The coordinated and simultaneous attacks stunned the country. The militant group shot passengers, especially those from Punjab, travelling to and from Balochistan in Musakhel district after checking their IDs and singling them out. The militants set fire to several vehicles and launched suicide attacks on the security forces. For the past few months, the BLA has been at the forefront of mounting attacks on infrastructures, especially those from the Chinese projects/investments and the Pakistani security forces stationed in Balochistan. Chinese engineers are being kidnapped and killed. These strikes have become a headache for Pakistan as Baloch rebels have targeted the Chinese-built Gwadar port. The Baloch perceived the Chinese investments, including modern residential colonies, as Islamabad’s well-planned move to colonise Balochistan to satisfy the elites from Punjab, especially the Army, by settling people outside the region and reducing the local Baloch population to a minority. Balochistan, Pakistan’s biggest province, is sparsely populated and rich in mineral resources. In March this year, the Baloch insurgents attacked Gwadar port. However, the Baloch insurgency has not remained confined to Balochistan. The Majeed Brigade, formed in 2011, has carried out attacks in other provinces of Pakistan as well.Baloch insurgencyThe Baloch grievances have lingered for decades, and the government has adopted a short-sighted policy to solve the problem. Since the beginning, they have dealt with the problem through discredited Sardars and tried to strike deals. A young group of Balochs is now leading the movement, taking away the leadership from the traditional feudal elites. This is the fifth phase of militancy since its advent in 2001, and it has intensified following the killing of Nawab Akbar Bugti, a Pakistani politician and advocate of Balochistan’s rights, in 2006.The insurgency in Balochistan and increased state security have resulted in the arrest, imprisonment and disappearances of several Baloch rights activists. This action has escalated the insurgency. For example, in 2022, the BLA attacked the Army camps in Panjgur and Naushki, and in March this year, they attempted to attack the Naval base in Turbat. However, the security forces neutralised the militants. The BLA has claimed responsibility for several attacks on security forces and installations. In January 2022, an attack on the check post in Balochistan’s Kech district killed 10 soldiers. The BLA’s Majeed Brigade attempted to enter the Port Authority complex in March 2024, where two soldiers were killed. In November 2023, 14 soldiers were killed in Gwadar in an ambush. Since the beginning, Pakistan has looked for a military solution to the insurgency, increasing the presence of security forces in the province. After the building of Gwadar Port, which the Chinese operate now, the Army has stepped up its operations to provide security. It has been involved in large-scale arrests of activists, but many security forces convicts have disappeared. Despite such protests, the state has failed to take action against those responsible for disappearances.Islamabad had believed that developing ports and infrastructure would have a salutary effect on the Baloch insurgency. However, the development is seen as the Pakistani government’s internal colonisation of the mineral-rich province.Baloch grievancesBesides historical grievances, Baloch’s independence has remained in BLA’s psyche since the 1947 partition. After the four phases of insurgencies in the province, the Pakistani government tried to play one group against the other to control the state until the assassination of the Baloch leader Akbar Bugti during the Musharraf regime. The killing changed the character of the Baloch insurgency, as females are now participating in suicide attacks.Islamabad has attempted to counter Baloch nationalism by inserting Islamic elements in Balochistan. The northern part of Balochistan has remained restive as the Lashkar e Jhangvi, a Deobandi supremacist, terrorist and militant organisation based in Afghanistan, was allowed to operate there. Moreover, during the US presence in Afghanistan, Quetta had become a major centre for Taliban activities. The growing religious extremism is visible as all-girls schools are being ordered to close. The Baloch have often considered themselves as minorities in their province as state-led colonisation of the province has become the norm. There have been several cases of Shia killings in Balochistan.The Aghaz-e-Haqooq-e-Balochistan Package (a scholarship for talented Balochistan students), announced in 2009 by the Syed Yousuf Raza Gillani government, was criticised for being too little, too late. However, the most important part of the package was the payment of Rs120 billion in the next 12 years for the arrears of the Gas Development surcharge from 1954-91.The province’s economic backwardness is always attributed to Islamabad’s stepmotherly attitude. Gas extraction from the province, especially Sui gas, is considered a resource extraction that benefits other provinces except Balochistan. There have been accusations that the Pakistani state is exploiting rich mineral resources without paying royalties to Balochistan’s government. According to “The Voice for Baloch Missing Person”, there have been 7,000 registered disappearances since 2004. The Commission of Inquiry on Enforced Disappearances, appointed by the government in January this year, reported 2,752 active cases of enforced disappearances. The Baloch groups have organised several marches to Islamabad to underline the enforced disappearances. The government considered criminalising those who filed false disappearance cases in 2021 through the Criminal Law (Amendment) Bills to reduce the number of reported missing persons. However, the government was finally forced to reconsider its decision as criminalisation would prevent people from filing cases. Finally, in 2022, the amendment declaring enforced disappearances a heinous crime was passed. According to a 2023 report, there was a 63 percent increase in violence in Balochistan. The Baloch have organised long marches to highlight their grievances, and Mama Baloch has led several of them. In June, the Baloch Raji Machi (National Gathering), organised by the Baloch Yakjehti Committee, protested in Gwadar against extrajudicial killings and disappearances to protect the rights of the Baloch people. Three protestors were shot dead by the Frontier Corp forces during the gathering. The recent attacks are going to compound Pakistan’s security predicaments. They will affect regional stability in the volatile Afghanistan-Pakistan region where the Baloch people live in three countries—Iran, Pakistan and Afghanistan. \nIndia's renewed \"Neighbourhood First Policy\" amid regional changes prompted high-level visits between India and Nepal, highlighting the need for deeper engagement and addressing shared concerns, including China's growing influence in Nepal.\nAmidst widespread political stagnation in Nepal, a proposal to limit the terms of politicians has sparked debate, with proponents arguing for accountability and opponents citing impracticality.\nDemocrat Kamala Harris leads Republican Donald Trump 45% to 41% in a Reuters/Ipsos poll published on Thursday that showed the vice president sparking new enthusiasm among voters and shaking up the race ahead of the November 5 election.The 4 percentage point advantage among registered voters was wider than a 1 point lead Harris held over the former president in a late July Reuters/Ipsos poll. The new poll, which was conducted in the eight days ended Wednesday and had a 2 percentage point margin of error, showed Harris picking up support among women and Hispanics.Harris led Trump by 49% to 36% - or 13 percentage points - among both women voters and Hispanic voters. Across four Reuters/Ipsos polls conducted in July, Harris had a 9-point lead among women and a 6-point lead among Hispanics.Trump led among white voters and men, both by similar margins as in July, though his lead among voters without a college degree narrowed to 7 points in the latest survey, down from 14 points in July.The findings illustrate how the US presidential race has been shaken up over the summer. President Joe Biden, 81, folded his flailing campaign on July 21 after a disastrous debate performance against Trump sparked widespread calls from his fellow Democrats to abandon his re-election bid.Since then, Harris has gained ground against Trump in national polls and those in critical swing states. While national surveys including Reuters/Ipsos’ give important signals on the views of the electorate, the state-by-state results of the Electoral College determine the winner, with a handful of battleground states likely to be decisive.In the seven states where the 2020 election was closest - Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Georgia, Arizona, North Carolina, Michigan and Nevada - Trump had a 45% to 43% lead over Harris among registered voters in the poll.“It’s obvious that running against Harris is more challenging for Trump given the shift in these numbers, but it’s certainly not insurmountable,” said Matt Wolking, a Republican campaign strategist who worked on Trump’s 2020 campaign. He said Trump needs to stay as focused as possible in his campaign “so he’s not scaring” away voters who were leaning his way because they didn’t like Biden.Since formally accepting the Democratic nomination last week, Harris has embarked on a tour of battleground states including Georgia, where Biden had been haemorrhaging support before he ended his campaign.RISING ENTHUSIASMSome 73% of Democratic registered voters in the poll said they were more excited about voting in November after Harris entered the race. And while a March Reuters/Ipsos poll found that 61% of respondents who intended to vote for Biden were doing so mainly to stop Trump, 52% of Harris voters in the August poll were voting to support her as a candidate rather than primarily to oppose Trump.“We see it in this poll that people are more motivated about the future than the past,” said Aimee Allison, founder of She the People, a liberal group that aims to grow the numbers of women of colour in elected office. “They see Kamala Harris as the future, and Republicans see this election as just about Trump. Voters are more likely to be engaged when given the option of ‘more than’ beating Trump.”But Trump voters also voiced enthusiasm about their candidate, with 64% saying their choice was more motivated by backing Trump than opposing Harris.Voters picked Trump as having a better approach to managing the US economy, 45% to 36%, a wider margin than Trump had in another Reuters/Ipsos poll this week.Harris, by contrast, had a 47% to 31% advantage on abortion policy. The issue is salient for Democrats after the conservative US Supreme Court in 2022 struck down women’s national right to abortion. Trump nominated three conservative justices to the court during his 2017-2021 presidency. Some 41% of voters in the poll - and 70% of Democrats - said they were worried the next president might sign a national ban on abortions.The latest poll’s survey period partially overlapped with the August 19-22 Democratic National Convention in Chicago where Harris formally accepted her party’s nomination, and it remains to be seen whether the same level of enthusiasm for Harris will continue.The poll was conducted nationally and gathered responses from 4,253 US adults, including 3,562 registered voters.Independent candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who suspended his campaign on August 23 while the poll was still being conducted, had the support of 6% of voters in the survey. \nThe District Administration Office, Kathmandu, has warned against celebrating the Teej festival with excessive extravagance.The office has appealed to avoid organising ‘unnecessary extravagance and costly events’, stating that those who do so may face legal action under the Social Practices (Reform) Act, 1976, and its regulations.According to the notice, lavish celebrations during Teej have increased in recent years compared to the past.“The Social Practices (Reform) Act, 1976, and its regulations provide clear guidelines for organising religious, social, and cultural festivals. Therefore, the administration strongly requests that no extravagant events be organised,” the notice reads.“Any Teej events featuring unnecessary extravagance and expense will be closely monitored, and legal action as per the prevailing law.” \nMillions of people were told to evacuate from their homes as Typhoon Shanshan lashed southwest Japan with strong winds and heavy rain on Thursday, knocking out power, snarling air traffic and forcing major factories to close.At least three people have been killed so far and scores injured in what authorities have warned could be one of the strongest-ever storms to hit the region.Major automaker Toyota suspended operations in all of its domestic plants due to the storm, while Nissan, Honda and chipmakers Renesas and Tokyo Electron also temporarily halted production at some factories.Funeral parlour employee Tomoki Maeda was in a hearse when the typhoon struck Miyazaki city in southern Kyushu, shattering windows and tearing down walls of some buildings.“I’ve never experienced such a strong wind or tornado in my 31 years of life,” Maeda told Reuters.The typhoon, with gusts of up to 50 metres per second (180 km per hour/112 mph), was near Unzen city in Nagasaki Prefecture at 1:45 pm, moving north at about 15 km per hour, according to the weather agency.Around 230,000 households in seven prefectures were without power in the afternoon, according to Kyushu Electric Power Co. The utility earlier said there was no impact at its Sendai Nuclear Power Plant in Satsumasendai city, where the storm made landfall earlier on Thursday.Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi told a news conference that three people had died and one was missing in incidents related to the typhoon, while the disaster management agency said 45 had suffered injuries.After hovering over Kyushu for the next few days, the storm is expected to approach the central and eastern regions, including the capital Tokyo, around the weekend, the weather agency said.More than 5.2 million people have been issued evacuation notices across the country, authorities said.Madoka Kubo, who runs a hotel in historic city of Hitoyoshi in Kumamoto prefecture, told Reuters that all reservations had been cancelled and her hotel was now being used to house elderly people who had been evacuated from nearby areas.Airlines, including ANA Holdings (9202.T), and Japan Airlines (9201.T), have already announced cancellations of nearly 800 flights. Train services have been suspended in many areas of Kyushu while hundreds of bus and ferry services have also been halted, according to the transport ministry.Typhoon Shanshan is the latest harsh weather system to hit Japan, following Typhoon Ampil, which also led to blackouts and evacuations, earlier this month. \nHeavy rains battered parts of India’s western state of Gujarat this week, flooding cities, snapping utility links and forcing thousands to leave their homes, with at least 28 dead, authorities said on Thursday, warning of more heavy downpours.Army rescue teams have joined the relief effort, as people waded through waist-high waters that have partly submerged vehicles and roads, visuals from Reuters television showed.“There is no electricity for the last two days,” said Prabhu Ram Soni, who lives in the coastal city of Jamnagar. “I have an eight-month-old daughter and an asthma patient, my mother, who is on oxygen support.”Since Sunday, 28 people have died from drowning and rain-related causes, while more than 18,000 have been evacuated from cities near the coasts, disaster management authorities said.Heavy rains continued in Jamnagar, home to the world’s largest oil refinery complex, owned by Reliance (RELI.NS), the district collector, B K Pandya, told Reuters.At nearby Vadinar, Nayara Energy, backed by Russian groups including its largest oil producer, Rosneft, runs another refinery.“They are operational,” Pandya said, when asked if rain had affected work in the refineries, adding that authorities were focusing on rescue efforts in the district.India’s weather office has warned of extremely heavy rainfall forecast on Thursday in Gujarat’s districts of Bharuch, Kutch and Saurashtra, with Friday expected to bring heavy rain, thunderstorms and lightning.The rains have been caused by a deep atmospheric depression off the coast of Gujarat, which has also affected the southern coast of neighbouring Pakistan, with its largest city of Karachi lashed by heavy rain.Officials in Pakistan’s southern province of Sindh warned against torrential rain, rough seas and flooding expected on Thursday, as the weather system moves westwards from India.After recent heavy rains lashed the port city of Karachi, authorities have warned of flash floods in two districts of Sindh still recovering from 2022 floods that inundated large swathes of the country. \nA Hong Kong court on Thursday is expected to hand down verdicts against two editors of a now-defunct online media outlet for conspiring to publish seditious articles in a case that has drawn international scrutiny.This is the first sedition trial against any journalist or editor since Hong Kong’s handover from Britain to China in 1997.It is a case that critics, including the US government, say reflects deteriorating media freedoms under a years-long national security crackdown in the China-ruled city.Stand News, once Hong Kong’s leading online media outlet with a mix of critical reportage and commentary, was raided by police in December 2021 and had its assets frozen, leading to its closure a few days later.Its top editors, Chung Pui-kuen, 54, Patrick Lam, 36, and the outlet’s parent company Best Pencil (Hong Kong) Ltd, were all charged with conspiracy to publish seditious publications in connection with 17 news articles and commentaries between July 2020 and December 2021.All those charged pleaded not guilty. If convicted, they face a maximum two years jail term.During the 57-day trial, government prosecutor Laura Ng alleged Stand News had acted as a political platform to promote “illegal” ideologies and incited readers’ hatred against the Chinese and Hong Kong governments.Ng described the articles as seditious, including interviews with jailed or exiled pro-democracy politicians and a news article about jailed human rights lawyer Chow Hang-tung.Foreign governments including the US, and media freedom advocacy groups said the case showed how authorities had suppressed freedoms and intensified self-censorship since the national security law was passed in 2020.“Report the truth”Chung, who chose to testify in court, was in the witness box for 36 days of the trial, defending media freedoms and saying Stand News had only “recorded the facts and reported the truth”, while giving voice to a spectrum of voices including democrats.“The media should not self-censor but report,” he said.Chung stressed that they upheld the principle of publishing every article they received to “showcase the greatest extent of freedom of speech”, as long as they didn’t immediately cause violence, affect public health and cause defamation.Stand News was forced to shut down and take down all its online content after a police raid.The verdict was originally scheduled to be delivered last October, but it was adjourned three times to wait for the High Court to hand down its ruling on an appeal by a pro-democracy activist Tam Tak-chi against his conviction and sentence on charges which included sedition offences. \nDespite slowed economic growth, Nepal’s external sector appears stronger than ever, thanks to remittances, tourism and the appreciation of the US dollar.Nepal’s three external indicators—foreign exchange reserve, remittance earnings, and tourism income, which represent all international economic transactions between residents of the country—reached a historic high in the last fiscal year that ended mid-July.Conversely, the country’s statistical body, the National Statistics Office, has projected Nepal’s economic growth to be at a meagre 3.87 percent for 2023-24 due to the poor performance of the internal sector. According to experts, the mismatch is due to political uncertainty and growing corruption, as the external sector's growth did not support the internal sector. “It’s good that tourism income has grown. This will generate jobs,” said Nara Bahadur Thapa, former executive director at Nepal Rastra Bank, the country’s central bank. “But at the same time, growing remittance earnings means no job prospects at home. But the money sent by migrant workers has boosted foreign exchange reserves to an all-time high.”Though Nepal is in a remittance trap, the country could turn this into an opportunity by investing in the real sector. “The best option to channel remittances is to bring the private sector on board for investment in the productive sector,” said Thapa.Experts said that since the interest rate on credit has dropped significantly due to the huge amount of liquidity, investment is all that the country needs now. In the last fiscal year, Nepal’s gross foreign exchange reserves increased 32.6 percent to Rs2.04 trillion, a historic high. According to experts, such a trend in a least-developed country indicates no investment. According to the central bank report released on Sunday, remittance inflows increased 16.5 percent to Rs1.44 trillion in the last fiscal year, the highest amount on record.The remittances have been increasing because youth are leaving. In the last fiscal year, foreign employment permits were issued for 741,302 individuals (460,103 first-time and 281,199 renewed). The number is a slight reduction from 774,976 in the previous fiscal year.Under the service account, travel income, or expenditure made by foreign tourists, increased 32.1 percent to Rs82.33 billion in the review year, the highest revenue on record. The total number of tourist arrivals increased to 1.12 million in the last fiscal year from 862,992 in the previous fiscal year.The balance of payments remained at a surplus of Rs502.49 billion in the review year.With the upbeat external sector, the internal sector has remained dismal.“This is because the private sector investment has been shrinking for the last two years,” said Chandra Dhakal, president of the Federation of Nepalese Chambers of Commerce and Industry, the apex private sector body. He was speaking at an interaction in Kathmandu on Sunday.“As Nepal’s industrial capacity is under 40 percent. The private sector investment that contributes 86 percent to the economy has shrunk. This will naturally not generate employment opportunities.”He said that the demand for workers has boomed in the country, where the private sector has thrived. The World Bank said in its recent report that frequent political changes, a significant drag on businesses for over a decade, have dampened private investment. Thriving corruption and lack of accountability have stalled growth and forced tens of thousands of young Nepalis to try their luck abroad.Thapa, a former official at the central bank, said that with billions of dollars in the banks, the incumbent government has an opportunity to take advantage of it.Nepal is currently ruled by an unusual coalition of the two largest parties and this brings both challenges and opportunities. “The government has to facilitate the private sector. It has to ask the private sector to bring forward ready-to-invest projects,” said Thapa. The capital market is gaining momentum. “Through initial public offerings (IPOs) and follow-on public offers (FPOs), the government can facilitate raising money and enable the private sector to invest in the productive sectors that create jobs,” said Thapa. However, political wrangling has paralysed the country.The Securities Board of Nepal (SEBON) and Nepal Tourism Board have been headless for months. Nepal Electricity Authority has yet to open the door for signing the power purchase agreement with the big developers even though the country has huge loanable funds.“The government and the private sector both have to invest,” said Dhakal. “For every rupee the government spends, the private sector has been spending Rs5.”Economists say that the government’s capital injection into the economy would encourage the private sector to pump the investment.Over the years, private investment has remained sluggish. For example, the import restriction imposed by the government two years ago discouraged the private sector from spending, decreasing capital in the market and intermediate goods imports. As a result, public consumption and investment contracted, ultimately impacting the government’s revenue collection.Economists and statisticians say Nepal, which is set to graduate from the least developed countries by 2026, does not have the environment to achieve double-digit economic growth in the immediate future due to low investment from the government and the private sector.The country’s statistical office recently said that, given the ongoing investment, Nepal’s growth rate will neither slow down nor grow. It will remain static. According to economists, everything from wages to business growth and social security to other state benefits will remain static, which will encourage youth to try their luck abroad. \nAs the festive season approaches—a time when consumers are mercilessly exploited—the government is doubling down on its efforts to set up consumer courts for the first time in Nepal, aiming to safeguard consumer rights.It has been nearly two and a half years since the Supreme Court ordered the government to establish consumer courts in all provinces to speed up justice delivery.On Sunday, Industry, Commerce and Supplies Minister Damodar Bhandari told an interaction at the central supply and consumer department of the Nepali Congress that a consumer court would be established within a month.“The presence of the consumer court will have a significant impact on controlling food adulteration, artificial shortage and price manipulation.”But consumer rights activists remain sceptical and dismiss it as yet another lofty promise.Consumers face difficulty accessing water, energy, telecoms and financial services, despite paying for them. Besides, as Nepal’s e-commerce grows, now more than ever, instances of consumers fraud are becoming more prevalent.Nepal’s quality control watchdog, the Department of Food Technology and Quality Control, filed 178 cases in district administration offices against producers and traders for producing and selling substandard food items and animal feed in the last fiscal year. There were 121 cases in the previous fiscal year. Consumer rights activists say the district administrations deliver justice in only a handful of cases.Speaking at the interaction, lawmakers criticised party politics for protecting wrongdoers.They said that whenever market inspection teams raid certain shops or factories, top officials receive phone calls to protect those businesses. On May 28, the budget announced the allocation of necessary funds to set up consumer courts. An official at the Ministry of Industry, Commerce and Supplies said that the government allocated a budget of Rs10 million for administrative expenses to establish at least one consumer court in one of the districts in Kathmandu Valley. However, setting up consumer courts requires a considerable amount of money. As a temporary measure to comply with the Supreme Court’s order, officials plan to rent a separate room in a district administration office to set up the court, which will then begin hearing cases.Consumer rights activists said that forming a court within a month is impossible.“I attended the function when the industry minister Bhandari delivered his speech. We applauded, and the function concluded,” said Prem Lal Maharjan, president of the National Consumers Forum.“This is one of the glaring examples of how promises are made and not delivered.”“A consumer court inside a district administrative office, with a limited budget and few judges, is a joke,” said Maharjan. The top court had ordered the setting up of consumer courts in all 77 districts with separate infrastructure. In mid-June, the Industry Ministry's draft report on establishing a consumer court was submitted to the Law Ministry and sent to the Judicial Council for its suggestions.However, Ashok Kumar Chhetri, spokesperson for the Judicial Council, said he was unaware of the development.“The draft regarding the formation of consumer courts has not come to my notice.” The Consumer Protection Act, 2018, has a provision requiring the government to establish consumer courts. Based on this provision, the Ministry of Industry, Commerce, and Supplies submitted a draft of legislation to the Ministry of Law in September 2019. As the process dragged on, the Supreme Court, on February 20, 2022, ordered the government to establish consumer courts in all provinces to protect buyers' interests amid repeated instances of unfair market practices.A division bench of justices Bam Kumar Shrestha and Nahakul Subedi issued the order after the Forum for Protection of Consumer Rights Nepal moved the court. Although the draft reached the Ministry of Law and then the Ministry of Industry, Commerce, and Supplies, the process has been delayed due to frequent changes in government.According to an official update on the development, the Ministry of Industry cancelled the previous process last year and started afresh by forming a committee.The committee recommended setting up a pilot consumer court in a suitable location within the Kathmandu Valley, in coordination with or on the advice of the Judicial Council, considering the country's current condition and available resources, the official said. According to officials, more consumer courts will be gradually established in other districts based on financial resources.The Industry Ministry official said they realised that setting up just one consumer court per province would not be practical, as people would have to travel long distances for their cases. Therefore, the draft proposes gradually setting up consumer courts in all districts.A consumer court is a specialised court which primarily deals with consumer-related disputes, conflicts, and grievances. The court holds hearings to adjudicate these issues.The public has long been demanding a consumer court to bring unscrupulous traders under a legal framework within a fast-track system.Since consumers often hesitate to get involved in complex court cases, observers believe this has emboldened dishonest traders. They believe that once consumer courts are established, filing complaints will become easier, and the process will involve fewer hassles. \nAnother Olympic Games has come and gone and Nepal’s quest to bring home an official Olympic medal continues to seem like a pipe dream.Nepal sent seven athletes to the 2024 Summer Games in Paris to compete in six different sports but none of them will have anything to show for back home—no athlete from Nepal has won a single official medal in the country’s 60-year Olympic history.But, is it at all realistic to expect an Olympic medal from Nepali athletes?“Winning a medal at the Olympics is not impossible. But our investment and preparation for the Olympics and other international events are woefully inadequate,” said former Olympican Deepak Bista, who currently serves as the president of Nepal Olympians Association and the director of national team preparation, at the National Sports Council. “There are no proper venues for players to train and practice, So how do you compete against elite athletes from around the world?” Athlete Santoshi Shrestha completed the difficult 41.195km track of the women’s marathon event in the 79th position out of 91 athletes. Her timing of 2 hours 55 minutes and 06 seconds was far from her previous best and national record of 2 hours 46 minutes and 23 seconds, which she set on the way to marathon debut gold at Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Dhaka Marathon earlier this year.After the women’s marathon, Santoshi said she could have set a new national record in Paris had she pushed herself more in an endurance-testing track, but she chose not to because of fear of possible injury.“I could not take the risk because the track was very steep after 15 km. I was comfortable and could have made a new record there [in Paris] but I chose to stay in the comfort zone. I want to compete in other tournaments as well,” said Santoshi.But Santoshi’s story could have been different had her preparations and training back home been better. “Further, players, coaches and team management all need to work hard with complete focus and dedication all round the year if they are to bring medals. Sadly, the state of our players is not good enough. They are compelled to find other jobs so that they can look after their families. How can we expect them to win medals at big tournaments?” added Bista, who was the second Nepali athlete to qualify for the Olympics, Beijing 2008.“The players need physical, mental and financial support.”Former Nepali Olympian Sangina Baidya also points to poor investment and preparation in sports for Nepal’s underperformance at the Olympics.“There is a lack of extensive investment in sports infrastructures. The state should be interested in the development of sports. If there is sufficient investment at the youth level, and they get substantial funding, resources and infractures, they can undoubtedly perform better in the international competitions including the Olympics,” said taekwondo practitioner Baidya, who was the first Nepali athlete to qualify for the Olympics, in Athens 2004, through a selection tournament.“In comparison to other successful countries, here in Nepal, preparations for the Olympics start late. They get only a few months of training, which is not enough,” she added.Judoka Manita Shrestha Pradhan has a similar story. She got a training room only two months before the Olympics and she was still expected to win at least one or two bouts in Paris—which is a lot to ask for. Shrestha Pradhan could not progress beyond the first round of women’s 57 kg weight category event.There is no targeted budget for the Olympics programme despite the sports sector getting Rs3.5 billion for the fiscal year 2024/25. Only Rs9 million was allocated for the transport, lodging and food of athletes and officials participating in the Paris Olympics and Paralympics.The Nepal Olympic Committee provides $750 per person to the 10 athletes of the 10 sports under the International Olympic Committee’s Solidarity scholarship, which is insufficient. Swimmers Alexander Shah and Duana Lama trained abroad, in the United States and Thailand, respectively, but the scholarship amount was not enough for them to train at top-class facilities. Lama finished last in her Heat and 30th overall in women’s 200m freestyle.Shah, who was competing at the Olympics for a second consecutive time, will at least return home with some joy. His 51.91 seconds in the men’s 100m freestyle Heat shattered his own previous national record of 52.17 seconds set during the World Aquatic Championship in Doha, Qatar.Badminton star Prince Dahal trained in Sri Lanka and had to travel to Paris 2024 without a coach as Nepali authorities did not send the name of the coach for accreditation and visa process on time.Prince Dahal could not win a single match in the men’s singles group stage. Shooter Sushmita Nepal finished 42nd in the women’s 10m air rifle qualification event. Table tennis player Santoo Shrestha also exited the Olympics from the men’s singles preliminary round.But big investment in sports may not always do the trick.Santoo Shrestha, who competed in the men’s singles table tennis at Paris Olympics, was the only third player in Nepal’s Olympic history to qualify for the Olympics through the selection stage—which is a perfect demonstration of how poor the country is technically.Take Jamaica and Kenya. Athletes in these countries are highly successful in athletics.Jamaica—the home of sprinter Usian Bolt, eight time Olympic gold medallist and world record holder in the 100 metres, 200 metres, and 4 × 100 metres relay—has won a total of 87 medals at the Olympics. Of them 86 have come from track and field.Kenya is the most successful African country at the Olympics, with a total of 124 medals so far. Of them 117 are from track and field and seven from boxing.Ethiopia is another nation which focuses on long-distance events. Their total of 58 Olympic medals have all come in long-distance events in athletics.India was once a dominant country in field hockey and won a record 11 Olympic medals, including eight golds between 1928 and 1980. Although the country experienced a drought in hockey medals, the sport is gradually finding new success after its team picked two consecutive hockey bronze medals in Tokyo 2020 and Paris 2024. Wrestling and shooting are the other sports Indian athletes specialise in.“The government should learn from how other countries prepare their athletes,” said Bista, suggesting that Nepal should target some sports for the 2028 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles and prepare accordingly.Nepal has won a total of 26 medals at the Asian Games. Of them, it has bagged 24 medals in martial arts, which include karate (4), taekwondo (14) and boxing (6). “Nepal should select sports in which Nepal is historically good, for instance martial arts. After that, the government should allocate a significant budget just for the Olympics programme and train the players from the beginning if it expects our athletes to do better,” Bista added.Technically, Nepal’s only medal at the Olympics came in 1988 in Seoul when Bidhan Lama won a bronze medal in the men’s 50kg weight category taekwondo competition. But his medal was counted as unofficial as the sport was then an exhibition event. Taekwondo entered the Olympics programme only at Sydney 2000.But the 2026 Asian Games in Aichi-Nagoya, Japan could be a head start.The National Sports Council has launched Mission 2026 as part of the preparations for the next Asiad and has targeted at least 10 medals. But, sadly, the government has only approved Rs20 million for the programme.“We don’t have enough funding for the programme. This amount will support our athletes for only five to six months. It is unfortunate that the government could not embrace the NSC’s mission.” Bista said, adding that he fears Mission 2026 will just be an ambitious dream.But Bista hopes Palesha Goverdhan may change history despite the odds. Goverdhan became the first Nepali paralympian to pass the selection stage when she qualified for the Paris Paralympics. She won a gold medal in the Asian Qualifiers in China.Govardhan also won a bronze at the 2022 Asian Para Games, becoming the first Nepali para athlete to win a medal at the event.“Palesha is training in London under one of the best trainers,” said Bista who added that the NSC is paying her training fees. \nKunwar has been the MD for just under three years. Before coming back to her homeland to join Daraz Nepal, she worked at different American companies, including Amazon, the world’s biggest e-commerce platform.

He is the founder and artistic director of Shilpee Theatre, Battisputali. He graduated from Commedia International Theatre School, Denmark, in 2011. Although he studied commerce in high school, he joined a year-long course in acting organised by Rastriya Nach Ghar and started his career in theatre.He also published three books: ‘Bimokshya’, ‘Aandhi ko Manoram Nritya’ and ‘Rupantaran ka Laagi Rangamanch’. He has directed over two dozen dramas and acted in about one and a half dozen dramas. In this conversation with the Post’s Timila Maharjan, Yubaraj explains how books and literature have helped him grow as a director and an actor.How did you discover your love for books?Since school, I’ve been passionate about fiction books, influenced by how my teachers brought folk stories and poetry to life. My father also played a role in my literary interests. He was a voracious reader of spy novels, which I didn’t find captivating, but he introduced me to Nepali literature.At school, I studied works by authors like BP Koirala, Dhruba Sapkota, and Dhruba Chandra Gautam, which deepened my love for reading and writing. School literary activities further nurtured my interest.I had access to more literary resources when I moved to Kathmandu for college. The Nepal-Bharat libraries offered free access to books, including Nepali literary magazines, contemporary literature, and academic texts. Reading became my escape, providing a peaceful retreat from everyday life.Which books or authors have had a significant impact on your work? Can you give an example of how a particular book shaped a production or a character you developed?Different books and authors have shaped my literary journey at various stages of my life. I went through a phase where I was captivated by Indian dramas, especially those by Mohan Rakesh, like ‘Ashadh Ka Ek Din’ and ‘Aadhe Adhure’. Later, I became a Girish Karnad, Badal Sarkar, and Vijay Tendulkar fan. I even acted in Karnad’s ‘Yayati’ at Shilpee.My interest then shifted to Shakespeare, though I found his language challenging. Studying Shakespeare’s works, such as ‘Macbeth’, ‘Hamlet’, ‘The Tempest’, ‘Richard III’, ‘As You Like It’, and ‘A Midsummer Night’s Dream’, in Denmark taught me the magic of poetic language.Henrik Ibsen’s ‘A Doll’s House’ and ‘Hedda Gabler’ were crucial in understanding drama’s structure and social realism. I also enjoyed Anton Chekhov’s long plays, like ‘The Seagull’, ‘Three Sisters’, ‘Uncle Vanya’, and ‘The Cherry Orchard’, performing ‘Three Sisters’ at Shilpee.Other influential works include ‘Jhaphal Satra’, ‘No Exit’, and ‘The Respectful Prostitute’. Albert Camus, Arthur Miller, and Tennessee Williams’ three-act plays also influenced my writing and perception.Nepali writers like Laxmi Prasad Devkota, Bal Krishna Sama, Gopal Prasad Rimal, Parijat, and Shankar Lamichhane have greatly influenced me. I have a special attachment to Parijat’s novel ‘Sirish Ko Phool’ and her other works, and I visited Burma to reflect on her writings. I also admire Nayan Raj Pandey and Kumar Nagarkoti’s recent works.Additionally, I appreciate Nepali authors like Khagendra Sangraula, Narayan Wagle, and Archana Thapa, as well as George Orwell, especially his dramas ‘Burmese Days’, ‘Animal Farm’, ‘1984’, and his essay ‘Shooting an Elephant’.Do you have a routine or specific time set aside for reading, or is it spontaneous?I don’t have a fixed reading schedule, but I prefer reading in my home library. I’ll read in bed or in the bathroom if that's uncomfortable. I need a quiet, personal space to avoid distractions, as interruptions make it hard for me to concentrate, and I often have to start over.How do books impact your process when creating new plays or performances?For me, study and writing are gateways to the creative world. Even when I'm not actively creating, they provide an escape from daily life. I can't write, direct, or act without diverse experiences. I need a solid understanding of the subject I'm working on, or else the process becomes a struggle, like trying to start a fire with damp wood. Literature from various writers broadens my perspective, introducing me to different environments, characters, cultures, and thought processes. It also pushes my imagination beyond clichés.You are also an author and have written books like Bimokshya, Aadhi ko Manoram Nritya and Rupantaran ka Laagi Rangamanch. So, what are the things that motivated you to write books?Initially, I wrote poetry and stories out of curiosity and interest. However, writing has become a deeper desire over the past ten years, especially after working in theatre. I've performed in many plays by both national and international writers, but there's always been a gap, a desire for certain stories that led me to create my dramas. Writing allows me to express emotions that acting and directing can’t fully convey. After experiencing various plays, reading books, and immersing myself in art and literature, different emotions—sometimes anger or pain—urge me to speak out. Writing gives me the freedom to express those feelings in unique ways. That's why I love writing.Is there a particular book you return to time and again for inspiration or comfort?I often revisit BP Koirala's books. I've read his biography thrice and think I'll read it again. Similarly, I've read ‘Hitler ra Yahudi’, ‘Sirish Ko Phool’, and ‘The Moving Body’ by Jacques Lecoq multiple times and always return to them. I also frequently read Peter Brook's works.Ghimire Yubaraj’s book recommendationsThe Hour We Knew Nothing of Each Other Author: Peter HandkePublisher: Yale University PressYear: 1989Handke’s postmodern play has over 300 characters, and they keep changing or shifting throughout the performance.No Exit Author: Jean-Paul SartrePublisher: Samuel French IncYear: 1944This amazing book explores questions about human existence and shares the author's philosophical insights.The Nordic Secret Author: Lene Rachel Andersen and Tomas Bjorkman Publisher: Fri TankeYear: 2017This one highlights how knowledge contributed to Europe's social and physical development and showcases the peak use of science and technology.Mero Kabita ko AradhanAuthor: Balkrishna SamaPublisher: Sajha PrakashanYear: 1972This book is an honest memoir by Natya Siromani Bal Krishna Sama and serves as a great example of memoir writing.Hitler ra YahudiAuthor: BP KoiralaPublisher: Sajha PrakashanYear: 1958 Koirala offers a fresh perspective on war, using language I admire.

He has a strong grip on the party’s newly formed central committee as well.On Monday, the Unified Socialist announced a two-day election schedule. On Tuesday, central committee members cast their votes to elect 18 office bearers and 105 politburo members.The party’s 344 central committee members were the voters.Among the four vice-chairs elected in the open category, Gangalal Tuladhar, Jagannath Khatiwada, and Prakash Jwala are from the Nepal camp while Bhanubhakta Joshi is from the camp led by General Secretary Ghanashyam Bhusal.Another vice-chair from the Bhusal faction is Dharmanath Prasad Sah, who got elected vice-chair under the Madhesi category, defeating Ram Chandra Jha of the Nepal side. Nepal camp won vice-chair of the women’s category with Jayanti Rai beating Ram Kumari Jhakri of the Bhusal faction.Birodh Khatiwada, Lalit Bahadur Chhetri, Urbadatta Panta, Shadhya Bahadur Bhandari, Bijay Paudel, Keshav Lal Shrestha and Balaram Banskota lost the vice-chair race.For the four positions of deputy general secretary, the Nepal camp fielded Rajendra Kumar Rai, Laxman KC, Ram Chandra Yadav and Rajkumar Bhattarai. Of them, Rai and Bhattarai were elected from the same camp. Also, Metmani Chaudhary and Garima Shah won the same positions without the camp’s backing.Sabitra Bhusal, Srinath Baral, Som Prasad Pandey, Sher Bahadur Kunwar, and Ganesh BK got elected as secretaries from the Nepal side. Chandra Bahadur Shahi and Baldev Chaudhary, who were not in Nepal’s panel, won secretary positions.Some leaders accused party chair Nepal of mobilising his faction to help leaders loyal to him win. According to the leaders, the Nepal faction had prepared a list of candidates and circulated it among the central committee members and asked them to vote only for them, despite his pledge to form committees based on consensus among top leaders. “After being elected the party chair unanimously, Madhav Kumar Nepal had promised to pick other office bearers through consensus,” a party leader, requesting anonymity, told the Post. “He later managed to nominate his loyalists to the central committee. When he has a majority in the committee, it is obvious that leaders close to him are elected office bearers.”Rajendra Pandey, who was elected senior vice-chair unopposed, is close to the party chairman.The Nepal faction had circulated a list among the members asking them to vote for Gangalal Tuladhar, Prakash Jwala, Jagannath Khatiwada, Keshav Lal Shrestha in the vice-chair race.Though the general convention hall had mandated appointing 299 central committee members when forming the committee, the party increased the number of central committee to 344, says a party leader.A list of 93 central committee members was announced at the party's general convention, held from June 30 to July 5 in Kathmandu, with the rest to be elected later. The general convention elected Nepal the party chair, Bhusal the general secretary and Jhala Nath Khanal the senior leader unopposed.A task force comprising Chairman Nepal, senior leader Khanal, and General Secretary Bhusal had finalised the names of the central committee members. As per the task force's recommendation, the party announced 251 central committee members on August 2. The election body that conducted polling on Tuesday was counting votes cast for politburo members until late Wednesday evening. “The final result of politburo members will come out by Wednesday midnight,” said party leaders. The Unified Socialist, formed after a faction split from the CPN-UML in 2021, has 10 lawmakers in the 275-strong House of Representatives. \nThe CPN (Unified Socialist) on Tuesday elected its office bearers through a voting in Kathmandu.Gangalal Tuladhar, Bhanu Bhakta Joshi, Prakash Jwala, and Jagannath Khatiwada were elected vice-chairpersons under open category. Tuladhar received 189 votes, Khatiwada 161, Joshi 156, and Jwala 139.The Unified Socialist Party has a provision for electing four vice-chairpersons under the open category out of six vice-chairpersons.In the women’s vice-chairperson category, Jayanti Rai defeated Ram Kumari Jhakri. Rai secured 199 votes, while Jhakri managed only 112. Likewise, Dharmanath Prasad Sah was elected vice-chairperson under the Madheshi category, receiving 164 votes, while his rival Ram Chandra Jha garnered 144 votes.Metmani Chaudhary, Rajendra Kumar Rai, Ram Kumar Bhattarai, and Garima Shah were elected deputy general secretaries. Chaudhary received 158 votes, Bhattarai and Shah each garnered 107 votes, and Rai got 106 votes.Likewise, Baldev Chaudhary from the indigenous category and Ganesh Bishwakarma from the Dalit category were elected secretaries. Chaudhary received 175 votes, and Bishwakarma got 180 votes.Similarly, Sher Bahadur Kunwar, Som Prasad Pandey, Chandra Bahadur Shahi, Sabitra Bhusal, and Shreenath Baral were elected as secretaries under the open category. Kunwar received 153 votes, Pandey 141, Bhusal 106, and Shahi 91.The elections for these positions were held among central committee members. Rajendra Pandey was elected unopposed as the senior vice-chairperson. The party’s general convention, held in Kathmandu from June 30 to July 5, unanimously elected Madhav Kumar Nepal as chairman, Ghanashyam Bhusal as general secretary, and Jhala Nath Khanal as senior leader.The party’s central committee members voted to elect the office bearers on Tuesday, two months after the general convention.The party’s statute mentions that it will have 21 office bearers.After the general convention unanimously elected the chairman and general secretary, the office bearers were expected to be appointed based on consensus. However, party insiders said leaders close to Chairman Nepal lobbied hard to hold an election for office bearers. \nAs the dispute between the government and Kulman Ghising, the executive director of Nepal Electricity Authority (NEA) lingers, CPN (Maoist Centre) Chairman and former prime minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal has backed Ghising.When six of the industries failed to pay the tariff for using the specialised feeder and trunk line to obtain electricity, the NEA had last month cut off the power supply of those industries. For days, despite the written order of the Electricity Regulatory Commission and the verbal orders of Prime Minister Oli, NEA chief Ghising had refused to restore power to six industries.NEA later supplied the electricity to the industries but by then relations between Prime Minister Oli and Ghising had soured.NEA also cut off the power to some industries in January this year. NEA resumed supply to the industries following the government’s recommendation.Dahal, also the leader of the main opposition in the House of Representatives, addressing the House on Tuesday said that his party would support Prime Minister Oli if the latter decides to collect the electricity tariff arrears amounting to almost Rs22 billion from the Cabinet.The industrialists owe roughly Rs8.25 billion—Rs 6.65 billion plus a 25 percent fine—according to the NEA. Industrialists who used the exclusive feeder and trunk lines for energy were first estimated by the NEA to owe almost Rs22 billion. But the arrears were adjusted when the government-appointed commission's advice was taken into account in order to resolve the disagreement.The commission of inquiry tasked with resolving the tariff dispute of dedicated and trunk lines submitted its report to the Dahal government on May 6. Commission chair Girish Chandra Lal, a former Supreme Court justice, had submitted its report to Energy, Water Resources and Irrigation Minister Shakti Bahadur Basnet. The commission was formed on January 9.Based on the commission’s report, the Dahal government decided to adjust the outstanding amount and collect Rs6.65 billion and 25 percent fine to it. However, speaking in Parliament on Tuesday, Dahal challenged the Oli government to go against his government’s decision.“The NEA has so far issued bills of almost Rs22 billion. Let the upcoming Cabinet make a decision to recover this,” Dahal said.The regulation related to the NEA’s billing has no provision to discount the amount, despite the commission’s recommendation, says NEA spokesperson Chandan Kumar Ghosh.“But when the government also gave a similar kind of order, NEA, an organ of the government, had no other choice than to obey the order,” Ghosh told the Post.As the NEA pressures the industries to clear their earlier dues and some have paid their bills, many say they will not do so until they receive the time of day (TOD) meter data from the NEA.In response, the NEA earlier this month provided the parliamentary Public Account Committee (PAC) with an extensive record of the energy supplied to the industries through dedicated feeders and trunk lines, including the TOD metre data.A tough debate over the electricity tariff also occurred recently in the Public Account Committee between the lawmakers of the CPN-UML and the Maoist Centre.The parliamentary committee received over 100,000 papers from the state-owned electricity provider detailing logbooks, invoicing in Ampere, data from TOD metres, and specifics of bills given to industries.Since the row between the government and the NEA, Prime Minister Oli and NEA head Ghising are giving statements against each other.Defending Ghising, Maoist Centre Chairman Dahal accused Prime Minister Oli of being responsible for the failure to raise the electricity tariff.“The prime minister has asked via Facebook why almost Rs22 billion in tariffs was not collected for nine years,” Dahal said. “The person who is supposed to give an answer should not have asked the question.”Dahal also accused Prime Minister Oli of not letting NEA do its job.On May 14, 2018, the study committee formed by the NEA on the issue of trunk line and dedicated line came up with a report that 61 industrial houses used electricity from the dedicated trunk line but did not pay the tariff, and the NEA had started charging them accordingly, Dahal said in the House meeting.“At that time, Oli had ordered power supply to the industries be cut off,” Dahal accused. “Even some connections to factories were cut off to raise money, but later, with direct orders from Oli, they were restored.”Ghising was appointed the executive director of the power utility during Dahal’s prime ministership in 2016. Later, he was dismissed from the position during Oli’s tenure in 2021. However, the subsequent government led by Nepali Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba reappointed Ghising as the NEA head the same year.A decade ago, when there was severe load-shedding, the whole country faced power cuts for hours. It was during Ghising’s first tenure that the outages ended. The Maoist Centre has been capatilising on the success ever since.Maoist leaders often say that load-shedding had ended when their party led the government.When the dispute between the government and the NEA leadership continued, Oli, in the questions-answer session of Parliament on August 23, said that the dues for power delivered via specialised feeders and trunk lines to the industries would be recovered.Money will be collected but not by cutting off power supply, Oli said. \nAlmost two months after concluding the party's general convention, the CPN (Unified Socialist) on Monday decided to elect its office bearers through a vote.“Discussions were held for long on whether to appoint the office bearers based on consensus or through a vote,” Jeevanram Shrestha, a leader of the party, told the Post. “Eventually the party has now decided to elect them through voting.”On the second day of the central committee meeting on Monday, the party decided to hold the election for the office bearers.The party’s election body published the two-day election schedule that started Monday. As per the timeline, nomination for the position of office bearers started on Monday while voting will start on Tuesday afternoon.The party's general convention, held in Kathmandu from June 30 to July 5, unanimously elected Madhav Kumar Nepal as chairman, Ghanashyam Bhusal general secretary, and Jhalanath Khanal as senior leader.The party’s statute mentions that it will have 21 office bearers. Since the party charter does not acknowledge the senior leader as an office bearer, the organisation now has to elect 19 office bearers to fill the vacant positions. After the general convention elected the chairman and general secretary unanimously, the office bearers were expected to be appointed based on consensus. However, party insiders said leaders close to Chairman Nepal lobbied hard to hold an election for office bearers.In a brief interview with the Post soon after being elected as party chair, Nepal had said the rest of the party secretariat also will be elected based on consensus. “We are trying to elect the secretariat members based on consensus,” Nepal had said. But, the process to elect the office bearers halted for long. When it started, the party decided to go for the election. “When the general convention was concluded in consensus, General Secretary Bhusal and senior leader Khanal were in favour of appointing the office bearers unanimously,” a party leader told the Post on the condition of anonymity. “Chairman Nepal, who commands a strong majority in the central committee, however, lobbied to elect them through voting.” The party’s central committee members will vote to elect the office bearers. At present the Unified Socialist has a 344-member central committee. A total of 93 central members were announced at the general convention held in July first week, while the remaining 251 members were selected on August 2. In the second phase, a task force comprising Chairman Nepal, senior leader Khanal and General Secretary Bhusal had finalised the names of the central members.As of Monday evening, Rajendra Pandey and Pramesh Hamal, who are close to the party chair, are preparing to contest for the post of senior vice chair position. The Khanal-Bhusal group is adopting a strategy not to field any candidate for this position and support one of them, says a party insider.“Beduram Bhusal, who became general secretary immediately after the formation of the party, was an aspirant for the post of senior vice chair,” the leader said. “However, he has agreed to support Hamal.”Chairman Nepal commands a strong majority in the party while Khanal and General Secretary Bhusal lead a separate faction. But the Nepal-led faction is divided into sub-factions which are led by Pandey and Hamal. The two leaders–Pandey and Hamal–are in a race to become the senior vice-chair. Apart from Beduram Bhusal, Hamal also has the support of senior leader Khanal, said multiple party leaders.Party insiders expect tough competition for the vice chair of the Madhesh Province as well. Ramchandra Jha and Dharmendra Prasad Sah are contesting for the position. Former deputy general secretaries Bijay Paudel, Prakash Jwala, Ganga Lal Tuladhar and Jagannath Khatiwada are contesting for the position of vice-chairs. Paudel and Jwala are from General Secretary Bhusal’s camp while Tuladhar and Khatiwada are from chairman Nepal’s camp. The party’s statute has a provision for seven vice-chairs. Likewise, former secretaries of the party, Birodh Khatiwada, Ramkumari Jhakri, Hari Prasad Parajuli, Nagendra Chaudhary, Rajendra Rai, Ambar Bahadur Thapa, Jeevan Ram Shrestha and Garima Shah, are contesting for the deputy general secretary positions.Deputy general secretary candidates Jhakri, Thapa and Khatiwada are from Nepal’s faction and are close to Rajendra Pandey’s team. Parajuli, Shrestha and Shah are close to General Secretary Bhusal. Chaudhary and Rai, though are from Nepal’s camp, try to maintain neutrality. According to party leaders, there are more than 50 aspirants for the seven positions of secretaries. The party now has to elect a senior vice-chair, seven vice chairs including one woman, four deputy general secretaries, and seven secretaries. Prior to the general convention, the party had amended its statute to increase the number of office bearers to 21, besides the senior leader.A group of CPN-UML leaders led by Nepal split the country’s largest communist party to form the CPN (Unified Socialist) on August 25, 2021. Nepal earlier served as the chief of the CPN-UML for 15 years. They split the party, protesting against UML chair KP Sharma Oli’s decision to dissolve the House of Representatives twice accusing him of trampling the new constitution and instigating political instability in the country.Following a poor performance in local and general elections in 2022, the Unified Socialist is now struggling to retain party members. In the federal and provincial elections, it failed even to secure the status of a national party. The party won only 10 seats in the 275-member House of Representatives in the general elections.Despite holding important portfolios in the federal and provincial governments, the party leaders find it difficult to stop its cadres from rejoining their old party, the UML, let alone attracting new members.  \nTwo and half months after its general convention, the Janata Samajbadi Party-Nepal picked office-bearers and central committee members.Chairman Upendra Yadav was given the mandate to select the party’s leadership without holding an election after the general convention was concluded without electing office bearers following the registration of candidacies for the positions.Chairman Yadav on Monday appointed a 30-member central executive committee and 27 central members and named the members of the central discipline commission, central audit commission, and central election commission.JSP-Nepal announced its central members and nine-member central executive committee after a month of the convention, but it struggled to pick office bearers.Rakam Chemjong has been appointed as co-chairman, while Raj Kishor Yadav, Mrigendra Kumar Singh Yadav, Govinda Chaudhary, Shivalal Thapa Magar, and Bidyut Bajracharya have been named vice-chairmen.The party has named Lalbabu Raut and Ram Kumar Sharma as general secretaries, while Manish Kumar Suman has been given the role of spokesperson. Prakash Adhikari, Deepak Karki, and Rekha Yadav have been appointed deputy general secretaries.The party has appointed seven secretaries: Leela Sitaula, Shailendra Sah, Suni Lama, Raj Kumar Rai, Suresh Mandal, Lakpa Sherpa, and Kamruddin Rai. Surita Kumari Sah has been appointed as the treasurer.The newly appointed 30-member central executive committee includes ten members. The members of the central discipline commission, central audit commission, and central election commission have also been selected. \nPanic gripped locals in ward 12 of Chandragiri Municipality, Kathmandu, on Thursday morning after a suspicious object was found in the locality.The suspicious object was spotted in front of Balambu Secondary School, sparking fears of a bomb threat.Locals informed the police, and a bomb disposal team from the Nepal Army arrived at the scene. According to the NA Directorate of Public Relations and Information, the team disposed of the suspicious object, which turned out to be a pressure cooker.   \nKathmandu Metropolitan City has extended the area to prohibit building any structure on either side of the rivers in its territory.In a notice on Wednesday, the city office stated that construction of any structure has been barred on the additional 20 meters from the existing prohibited area.According to the metropolis notice, if the city has, under the existing rule, prohibited any construction on 20 meters from the area marked as river, the prohibited area will now be altogether 40 meters on either side of the waterway.The metropolis said the decision was taken based on a recent Supreme Court verdict that directed the authorities concerned to prohibit construction within an additional 20 metres from riverbanks in the Kathmandu Valley.Currently, construction is permitted only 20 metres beyond major riverbanks in the Kathmandu metropolis.The notice issued by the metropolis states, “No construction will be permitted on an additional 20 metres of land on either side of the river, and ongoing construction will be halted.”It has also asked one and all not to release contaminated water, including sewage, into Bagmati River and its tributaries. “Private and government buildings, as well as commercial properties, must install soak pits for groundwater recharge,” it said. “Waste must not be disposed of in the rivers. Non-compliance will lead to legal action under existing laws.” \nThe rhythmic beat of the Dha echoes through a Bhaktapur alley, blending with the energetic footsteps of dancers. Bhaktapur, which sees jatras and festivals round the year, is no stranger to music, dance and celebrations. But this is not an ordinary occasion. The performers in question are Lakhe dancers who are reviving the Ranjitkar Lakhe dance after a century.The young dancers are preparing for Indra Jatra this year, where mask-clad Lakhe dancers roam the streets to rid the community of hardships and suffering. Lakhe, demon deities revered as protectors of people and crops, are thought to reside in the demonic mask. As the dancer dons the mask, the spirit is said to take over.Bhaktapur was once a key site for the Ranjitkar Lakhe performances, but the art form vanished from the city after the 1934 earthquake.“Bhaktapur suffered the most damage during the 1934 earthquake,\" says Ganesh Ram Ranjit, treasurer of the Ranjitkar Group’s Bhaktapur branch. “The destruction left residents struggling to recover for a decade, making it nearly impossible to perform the costly Lakhe dance.”The Ranjitkar Group discovered the extinct dance in the year the group was established. They located a Lakhe temple in Bhaktapur that had closed after the earthquake. After two years of research, they learned that performing the Lakhe dance was seen as a good omen in Bhaktapur and involved hosting community feasts. However, the high cost of this tradition forced many to sell their properties, rendering it unfeasible in the city’s post-earthquake conditions. Over time, the dance was abandoned as more lands supporting these cultural events were lost during rapid urbanisation.“There was a significant decline in our engagement with our cultural heritage,” says Rabi Shakya, a sculptor and Lakhe dance teacher training the new dancers. “The encouraging change now is the strong interest from the new generation, which is making it possible to revive intangible heritage like this dance.”After 100 years, the Ranjitkar Lakhe Dance is making a return to Bhaktapur at this year’s Indra Jatra.“It’s challenging to accurately re-enact the dance since it hasn’t been seen in a century,” Shakya notes. “As a sculptor, I drew inspiration from Bhaktapur’s revered Shree Navadurga Bhawani to create the Lakhe’s mask.” Similarly, the dance was choreographed by studying Lakhe dances from Kathmandu, Patan, and Banepa within the Ranjitkar community, and combining them with traditional steps from Bhaktapur Lakhe dances.“As for the musical instruments, we are using traditional instruments like Dha, Dhime, and Ponga, which are said to excite the Lakhe,” says Rajendra Maharjan, Lakhe dance teacher and musician.Maharjan is one of the experienced Newari arts teachers working to revive the lost Lakhe dance. He is involved in training young students in cultural arts and is now dedicated to the Ranjitkar dance training, with the students practising together nearly every day.“Becoming a Lakhe performer involves more than just wearing the costume and mask,” said Sudin Ranjit, a Lakhe dance student. “We must train extensively with our teachers, and it demands a lot of hard work.”To Ranjit, a resident of Bhaktapur, the training is more than learning a new craft; it is a matter of protecting culture. Growing up only interested in instruments, he slowly understood how important continuing cultural practices like Lakhe dances is for their community.“The dance will not only bolster Bhaktapur’s cultural pride but also boost tourism and create jobs,” says Dr Purushottam Lochan Shrestha, a professor and researcher specialising in Bhaktapur and Newari culture.Shrestha notes that reviving the dance would offer employment to everyone involved, from the dancers and the sculptor making the masks to those participating in the rituals. “Economic centres throughout the city, from small businesses to large industries, will benefit from the influx of tourists attracted by the Lakhe dance,” Shrestha adds, commending the Ranjitkar group's initiative.Once the Ranjitkar community revitalises the Lakhe dance, the Ranjitkar group plans to set up a new Guthi house with a fresh community fund and organise annual events for the dance.“The Lakhe dance won’t let them separate,” Shakya remarks.In today’s globalised world, where identity often merges into a homogenised blend, shared cultural practices provide a sense of connection and belonging. This new Lakhe dance embodies that spirit of togetherness for the community involved.“Reviving the dance after 100 years,” Shakya says, “is about preserving our culture for the next 300 years.” \nThe Lions Club of Kathmandu Corporate, Nepal MD325-D has felicitated various personalities as part of its endeavour to recognise the contribution of the individuals and business entities for the society.As part of its campaign, the Lions Club of Kathmandu honoured Prateek Pradhan with Social Journalism Award, Sylapa T Rimponche with Social Spiritual Award, Erika Gurung with Social Player Award, Ramesh Corporation with Social Corporate House Award, Rajendra Malla with Social Corporate Leader Award and Rajesh Hamal with Social Celebrity Award.Likewise, Chandra Ghimire is honoured with Social Bureaucratic Award, Binod Das with Sports Management Award, Anil Kedia with Social Academic Award, Mohan Ojha with Social Management Award and Surya Nepal with Corporate Social Responsibility Award.The Lionism embarked in Nepal in 1971 as the Lions Club of Biratnagar under the stewardship of former Prime Minister Matrika Prasad Koirala.The Lions Clubs International says it has over 2,000 clubs operating across the nation. \nThe government has declared a public holiday in the Kathmandu Valley on Sunday to celebrate the Bhoto Jatra.On the occasion of the festival, a public holiday has been declared in the three districts of Kathmandu Valley [Kathmandu, Lalitpur, and Bhaktapur], according to a statement by Narayan Prasad Bhattarai, spokesperson for the Ministry of Home Affairs, on Friday.The government announces a public holiday each year on this occasion.The month-long chariot-pulling festival of Rato Machhindranath concludes with the displaying of a bhoto (a jewel-studded vest) at Jawalakhel, Lalitpur. It is an annual cultural and religious ritual of displaying the black jewel-studded vest believed to be of then Nagraj, the serpent King.Machhindranath is revered as the God of rain, good harvest and prosperity. Paying homage to Lord Machhindranath is believed to bring good luck and fulfil one’s wishes. \n\n\nNepal’s largest auto show opened in Kathmandu on Tuesday. The biggest names showed off their latest products, particularly electric vehicles (EVs), which dominated the show, underlining how the country’s market is already in an all-electric state of mind.Organisers said automakers and dealers unveiled a slew of new models with discounts and bank finance galore.This is the 16th edition.Finance Minister Bishnu Prasad Paudel opened the auto show by saying that the monetary policy unveiled recently did not address the automobile sector, but the government has some plans to boost the sector, and amendments to the policy will be made accordingly.“We will take an appropriate move on electric vehicle (EV) policy amid the ongoing demand.”The auto show is expected to see transactions worth around Rs20 billion.Paudel said that the time has come to assemble vehicles in Nepal rather than continue to import all of them.“We are ready to extend every support to the manufacturers if they intend to establish a plant here,” he said.The government closely monitors the auto fair, which may provide a much-needed tax boost to the ailing economy amid the slowdown.Paudel said the auto fair was a significant event contributing to the government’s revenue.Dealers say that sales may get a boost after a recession in the auto sector for two consecutive years.According to the organisers, more than 50 auto brands are on display. However, the competition is between China and the rest of the world. Chinese brands, including BYD, Deepal, Skywell, Dongfeng, Omoda, Neta, MG, and Great Wall, feature at the six-day NADA Auto Show 2024 expo. As competition has heated, dealers have enticed people with small profit margins and announced newer, cheaper models and promotions.EVs dominate the NADA auto show, said Anup Baral, coordinator of the event. He noted that 24 four-wheeler brands, 19 two-wheelers, and 12 light commercial vehicles will participate in the fair.The auto show offers a four-wheeler for a price starting at Rs1.7 million.“All the 23 four-wheeler brands and 19 two-wheeler brands unveiled new models and variants on the first day of the auto show,” Baral said. Chandra Prasad Dakal, president of the Federation of Nepalese Chambers of Commerce and Industry, said Nepal still lacks sufficient infrastructure for EVs. “It can be both charging stations and roads, which are crucial.” Speaking at the opening ceremony, dealers said automobiles should not be considered a luxury sector. They said it needs to be considered in terms of the economy and sources of revenue.The private sector also raised concerns as spare parts, the million-dollar business, were happening through illegal channels.The auto show has around 120 stalls of two-wheelers and four-wheelers, including commercial vehicles, financial institutions, lubricants, batteries, and spare parts.Nepal’s booming EV market saw a 149 percent increase in imports in the last fiscal year, which ended in mid-July. The country brought in 11,701 EVs worth Rs29.48 billion during this period.Automobile traders said that roughly 85 percent of the passenger vehicle market in Nepal consists of EVs.The crowd has increased since the first day of the auto show.The stalls of two-wheelers, four-wheelers, and light commercial vehicles reported many bookings on the fair's first day.“We received a good number of visitors on the first day of the auto show compared to last year’s,” Baral said.What’s in the show?Hansraj Hulaschand and Co Pvt Ltd launched new two-wheelers, the Speed 400 and Scrambler 400 X. The Speed 400's introductory price is Rs639,900.Bajaj Motorcycles launched the Bajaj Pulsar NS400Z, priced at Rs559,900 in Nepal.Sipradi Trading, the authorised distributor of Tata Motors, launched Punch.ev with a starting price of Rs3.39 million.The authorised distributor of CFMOTO, Rishi Trade Center, launched the CFMOTO 450MT two-wheeler priced at Rs1.24 million. Laxmi E-Mobility, the authorised distributor of Kaiyi, unveiled three models. The starting price is Rs2.29 million.ZEEHO brand electric scooter AE4, distributed by Tishi Trade Center, launched a scooter at Rs299,900.Delta Autocorp, the exclusive distributor and importer of Vespa and the Aprilia scooter brands in Nepal launched the Aprilia Storm 125 BS6 scooter with an introductory price of Rs324,900.MAW Group, the authorised dealer of Yamaha, unveiled its latest adventure bike, the Yamaha WR 155R and MT 15 V2.CG Motors & CG Evolution Pvt Ltd has unveiled three new EV brands: AVATR, X-PENG and Riddara. \nNADA Auto Show 2024, Nepal’s biggest automobile fair, kicks off Tuesday in Kathmandu. Electric vehicle (EV) producers and representatives are here to tap into Nepal’s booming EV market, which saw 149 percent increase in imports in the last fiscal year, which ended in mid-July. The country brought in 11,701 EVs worth Rs29.48 billion during this period. The Post caught up with Balaje Rajan, chief strategy officer and vice president for International Business of Tata Passenger Electric Mobility, who is currently in Nepal to participate in the auto show, to talk about Nepal’s EV market, ongoing competition with Chinese EVs and the company’s future plans. Excerpts: How do you observe the Nepali EV market?Nepal has taken a very progressive stance towards EVs. Roughly 85 percent of the passenger vehicle market here now consists of EVs. It's a significant market for Tata Motors because, as the market leader over the last couple of years, we aim to maintain that spot, and we also believe that our products are perfect for Nepali roads. So, I see Nepal as a very important market. I also see Nepal as one of the benchmark automotive markets in the world where EVs are driving the market.The presence of Chinese EVs in the Nepali market is increasing faster. How do you view the competition? What are your strategies for staying ahead?Chinese EVs compete everywhere in the world, including in India. Despite multiple competitors, we have constantly innovated our products, and continue to retain a significant leadership position of about 70 percent plus market share in our home country, India. So, our products are more fit for the kind of use cases people see in Nepal. Our partnership with Sipradi, which has developed charging stations and vehicle servicing ecosystems in Nepal, will be our edge. The strength of our products, plus our partnership with Sipradi, will enable us to continue our success. Given the differences in terrain and infrastructure between Nepal and India, TATA EV customers complain that the range is not as advertised. How is the company addressing the issue?We have been communicating the real-world use range and product sales at the dealership. We have to differentiate between the certified range because of the certification methodology. There is a certain ideal test condition which, for statutory or regulatory reasons, we must declare in India. So, we are careful to ensure that that reference is not taken as the real-life range in a Nepal-type condition where the terrain is very different. We are giving a real-life range indication at the point of sale through our partner Sipradi, and we will also, with our current launch and going forward, declare the real-life range in our advertisements. So that customers would know exactly what the specific range is.What is the share of TATA EV in the Nepali market? Which models are popular with customers?We have had a tremendous run for about the last twenty months or so, starting with the pro-EV policies coming into effect. We are proud to say that last year, we were the market leaders, and this year as well, we have seen very strong retail growth. We want to regain that spot. When our Nexon was initially launched, followed by Tiago, we had a very good customer response. In the fleet segment, the Express T has a very strong response. We are launching the Punch at the NADA Auto Show, which starts Tuesday, and we expect a strong response. We will continue to bring our new models here, which will continue to be loved by customers. What are your sales expectations for the auto show?We expect that everyone will come and first have a look at the Punch. It’s a unique car that delights Nepali customers because of its high ground clearance. It has a compact footprint but is spacious inside to manoeuvre it on small roads. At the same time, high-ground clearance also allows you to go outside the Valley. I expect people to come to look at it and then test drive and give us the same type of commercial success that we saw with the Tiago last year.If demand for EVs continues to grow, when do you expect EVs to replace petrol and diesel cars in the passenger car segment in Nepal?I think over the medium term, for sure, there would be a significant impact on the import of petrol and diesel cars. It is also the right thing for Nepal, considering the abundant availability of electricity and the fact that oil [fossil fuel] must be imported. I think the government's policy of switching to EVs is very positive and progressive. In the medium term, as you can see today, 83 percent of customers are buying EVs. As more EVs are on the road, you will probably see only certain specialist use cases where petrol and diesel might still be around, and EVs will become mainstream in the overall pool.How do you assess the EV infrastructure in Nepal? What are the areas for improvement?The current charging infrastructure in Nepal, supporting around 5,000-6,000 cars, are located aptly. Through our partner Sipradi, there are charging stations every 150 km, offering a combination of fast and slow chargers. Siradi has the widest and most robust network of EV chargers. I met customers earlier today [Monday], and they were all very optimistic about the existing charging infrastructure in Nepal. Of course, as the market expands, the need for more charging stations will increase, and we plan to add accordingly. More chargers could be added based on customer demand in locations where chargers are already installed. For now, the charging infrastructure is reasonable, and future expansion will depend on the growth of EVs. Do you have any plans to open an assembly unit for EVs in Nepal? Currently, we don’t have any plans, but when it comes to any assembly, it is a combination of two things. One is the demand, and the second is the extent of incentivisation. So first, in terms of demand, Nepal has shown robust EV adoption. If the market grows significantly, it could justify considering setting up local assembly. The second factor is incentives, which are very important because any investment needs to provide a return. As of now, the size of the market and prevailing regulations do not make a strong case for local assembly, but we will continue to monitor the situation. \nOver 3,500 people across the country have been infected with scrub typhus since mid-July, the start of this fiscal year.Officials at the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division say they expect more cases in the coming days as the disease typically peaks in September.“Like in previous years, hundreds of people have also been infected with scrub typhus this year,” said Dr Gokarna Dahal, chief of vector Control Section at the division. “More people can get infected in the coming days, as the peak season is still ahead.”Scrub typhus, or bush typhus, is an infectious disease caused by the parasite Orientia tsutsugamushi, a mite-borne bacterium. It spreads in humans when bitten by infected chiggers (larval mites) found in mice.Until a few years ago, it was believed that people residing in rural areas or those working in grasslands or fields were at high risk. However, urban populations are also now being affected by the disease.“Over 100 people from Hetauda Sub-metropolitan city have been infected from Scrub typhus this year,” said Krishna Bahadur Major, chief of the Health Office, Makawanpur. “Although more cases are reported in villages, urban areas are not immune, with several positive cases emerging there as well.”Doctors point out high fever, headache, abdominal pain, backache, joint and muscle pain, red rash, nausea and vomiting as some of the symptoms of scrub typhus infection. Patients with severe illness may develop bleeding which could lead to organ failure. The infection can lead to respiratory distress, inflation of brain, lungs, kidney failure and then multi-organ failure. If not treated immediately, it could be fatal.Nepal saw a surge in scrub typhus cases after the calamitous 2015 earthquakes that killed nearly 9,000 persons across the country.Three months after the quakes, the BP Koirala Institute of Health Sciences, Dharan, alerted the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division about six children with unusual fevers and severe respiratory problems.Serum samples were collected for subsequent tests in Kathmandu and Bangkok, which confirmed a scrub typhus outbreak. By then, four children had already died in the course of the treatment. By the end of the year, 101 cases were confirmed in 16 districts, and four more people succumbed to the disease.The magnitude of the outbreak escalated in 2016 when 831 cases of scrub typhus were reported in 47 districts, and 14 people died by the end of that year.According to the Ministry of Health and Population data, more than 1,026 people were infected with the disease in 2020. Their number increased to 1,999 in 2021, and it rose to more than 2,900 in 2022.In 2023, over 5,000 people were infected with the deadly disease. Doctors say the risk of severity and fatality can be minimised if the patients are diagnosed and treated early, they say.Ordinary antibiotics, such as doxycycline and azithromycin, which are on the essential drugs list supplied by the government to health facilities across the country for free distribution, can cure the disease.However, what is concerning is that many health workers, including doctors, lack sufficient knowledge about diagnosing scrub typhus. Many health facilities also lack reagents to carry out tests for the disease.Doctors can diagnose the disease based on the symptoms, but the risk of misdiagnosis is high, as scrub typhus symptoms are similar to those of other illnesses. They warn that waiting for lab results before starting treatment could be dangerous. It can take about a week to get lab results, and by that time, if the patient is not treated can fall into a coma and suffer multi-organ failure. \nSeriously ill patients at District Hospital Sankhuwasabha are squeezed into every available space besides the beds: corridors, the floor, chairs, and even the storeroom, and outside on the hospital compound.With the spike in new cases of water-borne, viral fever and vector-borne diseases, mostly dengue, the hospital is struggling to cope.“Every day, around two dozen seriously ill patients end up sleeping on the corridor floor and in other areas,” Dr Pranam Jayaru, medical superintendent at the district hospital, told the Post over the phone from Khandbari, the district headquarters. “Our health workers have been working overtime to provide care, but we lack even the most basic supplies like IV stands. Patients’ visitors have to hold the IV bags or we have to improvise by tying them to windows.”This situation is becoming increasingly common in hospitals in many districts, which are seeing a spike in patient numbers amid a massive dengue outbreak. The virus has spread to 75 of the country’s 77 districts, killing at least three people and infecting 5,119 others since January. Two mountain districts—Humla and Mustang—have yet to record dengue cases this year. “For the last three years, we have witnessed a dengue epidemic during the monsoon season,” said Jayaru. “We can only request our staff to serve extra hours, but cannot provide equipment or expand bed numbers.”Doctors say most patients do not want to be referred to other places, as reaching Dharan, the nearest city, in an ambulance takes over six hours. Holding seriously ill patients in ill-equipped hospitals is risky as they lack consultant doctors, blood transfusion services, and high-tech laboratories, among other things.Experts say the deadly virus outbreak in most mountain districts and all hill districts shows the impact of climate change on Nepal’s healthcare system. Despite these challenges, no effective mitigation measures have been adopted.Many hospitals are overwhelmed by the influx of patients, and health workers are forced to place seriously ill patients in corridors and other makeshift spaces, compromising patient safety.“Our health facilities are not equipped to endure the climate crisis,” said Dr Meghnath Dhimal, chief researcher at the Nepal Health Research Council. “Many are built on hilltops or riverbanks, both vulnerable to climate impacts. These health facilities are also unprepared for emerging problems and spiking patient flow.”Of the 5,119 cases of the dengue cases reported, only 77 cases are from Madhesh Province, which is traditionally an endemic area. Health Ministry officials admit that the disease is shifting towards hills and mountain regions due to climate change. They say other factors, such as increased mobility and improved transportation, are also contributing to the spread of the disease to new areas. “Yes, new challenges have increased in areas previously considered less risky, but we have not strengthened our health facilities to deal with the emerging challenges accordingly,” said Dr Gokarna Dahal, chief of the Vector Control Section at the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division. “Our health system is not is not designed to address these evolving risks.”Dengue is a viral disease transmitted by female Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes. According to the World Health Organization, the same vector also transmits chikungunya, yellow fever, and the Zika virus.In 2023, at least 20 persons died, and more than 52,000 were infected by the virus across the country.In 2022, a total of 88 people died, and over 54,000 were infected by the virus. During that period, hospitals in the Kathmandu Valley were overwhelmed with dengue patients, and pharmacies ran out of paracetamol, the most widely used medicine to treat fever.Back in 2019, dengue killed at least six people and more than 16,000 were hospitalised across the country. The virus had spread to 68 districts at the time.Dengue has become a year-round threat in Nepal over the past few years with cases consistently rising each year.Epidemiologists as well as virologists now consider the dengue virus as a major public health problem in Nepal. They also say that despite thousands of persons getting infected and scores dying from the disease, the authorities have not taken the situation seriously. The lackadaisical approach, they believe, is contributing to the spread of the virus. They call for implementing measures such as search-and-destroy drives and awareness campaigns to control dengue vectors.A report by the United Nations titled “Climate Change 2022: Impacts, Adaptation and Vulnerability” states that at least six major vector-borne diseases have recently emerged in Nepal and are now considered endemic, with climate change implicated as the primary driver.The report also showed increasing evidence that climate change has extended the elevational distribution of Anopheles, Culex and Aedes mosquitoes, which carry viruses to above 2,000 metres in Nepal.Dengue-transmitting mosquitoes breed in clean water and bite people in daylight. Uncovered water tanks and other discarded objects such as plastic cups and bottles could be breeding grounds for the dengue-carrying mosquitoes.Symptoms of dengue include mild to high fever, severe muscle pain, rashes, severe headache and pain in the eyes, doctors say. Patients with these symptoms are advised to seek immediate treatment. While there is no specific cure for the disease, early detection and access to proper medical care can prevent death. \nIn a bid to monitor the nutrition status of the population, the Ministry of Health and Population is planning to carry out a nutrition assessment survey in all districts throughout the country in the ongoing fiscal year.Officials said the nutrition status of pregnant women, children under five, adolescents, and new mothers will be monitored during the survey.“We will first assess the nutrition condition of the people of specific age groups and then share the findings with relevant agencies, including the Ministry of Health and Population,” said Lila Bikram Thapa, chief of the Nutrition Section at the Family Welfare Division under the Department of Health Services. “The nutrition assessment survey is crucial for getting the latest picture of the nutrition status of the population.”Malnutrition is a silent crisis in Nepal. The country has made significant progress in reducing stunting among children under five. According to the Nepal Demographic and Health Survey-2022 report, stunting decreased from 57 percent in 2001 to 25 percent in 2022.Wasting, a debilitating disease that causes muscle and fat tissues to waste away among children under five, decreased from 11 percent in 2001 to eight percent in 2022.Wasting or low weight for one’s height in children, if not treated properly and on time, is associated with a higher mortality risk, according to the World Health Organisation.Even though the health survey report showed some improvement in the country’s overall nutrition status, progress is not the same in all provinces. More than 16 percent of the children under five years in Lumbini Province are found to be suffering from wasting—the most immediate, visible, and life-threatening form of malnutrition.Likewise, around 10 percent of children under the age of five years in Madhesh Province have been found suffering from wasting.Officials said the new study was required to determine the latest progress on the population's nutrition conditions.“The nutrition status of the adolescent population will be monitored by schools, while health facilities will monitor children, pregnant women, and new mothers,” said Thapa. “Health workers will also take classes in schools to educate students about the importance of good nutrition and counsel pregnant women and new mothers at health facilities.”Along with the lack of sufficient nutrient foods, poor sanitation and lack of safe drinking water and treatment are blamed for wasting.Doctors say malnutrition during pregnancy increases the risk of complications and maternal and neonatal deaths, as well as the likelihood of low birth weight. It is a major impediment to growth, affecting human capital and economic productivity of a country.Experts say nutrition is directly linked to the country's overall development. Malnutrition affects children's physical and mental growth, which ultimately affects the country’s economic health.It weakens intellectual capacity, limits productivity in adulthood, and increases vulnerability to certain diseases.Nutritionists ask authorities to promote locally available foods, educate people about the importance of a nutritious diet, and provide fortified flour to improve nutritional conditions and reduce dependency on freely distributed foods.Nepal also has an international obligation to improve the condition of malnourished children.To meet the SDG targets, the country needs to reduce stunting to 15 percent from the current 32 percent by 2030, wasting to four percent from the current eight percent, underweight condition to 10 percent from the existing 19 percent, and anaemia to 10 percent from more than 43 percent at present.The SDGs, a follow-up on the Millennium Development Goals, (MDGs), aim to end poverty, hunger, and all forms of inequality worldwide by 2030, and Nepal has committed to meeting the goals. \nLast week, doctors at Thapathali-based Paropakar Maternity and Women’s Hospital diagnosed a new mother in her late 20s with postnatal depression. Her newborn baby was admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit of the hospital due to health complications, and the mother was under care in the maternity ward.“We had to start her on anti-depressants, as she was showing serious symptoms, including suicidal thoughts,” said Dr Pratikshya Ghimire, a psychiatrist at the hospital. “She felt sad all the time, worried about the newborn's future, and had lost her appetite.” Mental health problems during pregnancy are the second leading cause of maternal deaths, after excessive bleeding during childbirth, also known as postpartum haemorrhage, and pre-eclampsia [pregnancy-related high blood pressure disorders. A report on maternal mortality unveiled last year by the National Statistics Office showed that six percent of maternal deaths were due to self-harm (suicide), with most cases occurring during pregnancy.To address mental health problems during pregnancy, the Ministry of Health and Population has started outpatient care services at the Maternity Hospital.“We have not only started outpatient care but also begun screening inpatients for mental health conditions,” said Dr Ghimire. “We have diagnosed around a dozen and a half patients with serious mental health problems.”According to Dr Ghimire, the woman had an inter-caste marriage, and neither her in-laws nor her own parents accepted her marriage, contributing to her mental health struggles. Several other pregnant women and new mothers have also been found suffering from mental health problems, each at various stages of severity.“The Health Ministry had deputed one psychiatric doctor to our hospital, and we started offering outpatient services after her arrival,” said Dr Shree Prasad Adhikari, the hospital's director. “We are also working on training all hospital staff in mental health screening so that conditions can be diagnosed early. Once mental health problems are identified, patients can be referred to specialists.”Officials hope that screening pregnant women for mental health problems and providing prompt treatment will help reduce maternal deaths, which have been rising alarmingly of late.Doctors say prenatal and postnatal depression can occur at any time during pregnancy or after childbirth. Shifts in hormone levels during pregnancy and after childbirth can significantly affect mood. Many women feel anxious about changes happening to their bodies. Some may even have financial concerns and some worry about taking on new and additional responsibilities.Some women experience extreme sadness, anxiety, fatigue, and changes in sleeping and eating habits during pregnancy or after childbirth. Experts warn that prenatal and postnatal depression along with anxiety and other mental health issues, can lead some women to take their own lives.They also emphasise that excessive bleeding after childbirth, also known as postpartum haemorrhage, pre-eclampsia (pregnancy-related high blood pressure disorders), and suicide are preventable. “Timely screening for mental health problems and proper counselling can significantly reduce the mental health problems faced by pregnant women and new mothers,” said Adhikari. “We have launched this initiative at our hospital, and this is something other hospitals should also implement.”Nepal reduced the maternal mortality rate from 539 per 100,000 births in 1996 to 239 per 100,000 births in 2016. For this, the country also received a Millennium Development Goals award. The 2021 census report showed that in every 100,000 live births, 151 women died from maternity-related complications. According to the report, 88 maternal deaths were prevented in every 100,000 live births between 2016 and 2021. Nepal’s target under the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals is to reduce the maternal mortality rate to 75 per 100,000 births by 2030. \nA World Health Organization official stressed on Tuesday that mpox, regardless of whether it is the new or old strain, is not the new Covid, as authorities know how to control its spread.“We can and must tackle mpox together,” said Hans Kluge, WHO regional director for Europe, in a UN media briefing.“So will we choose to put the systems in place to control and eliminate mpox globally? Or we will enter another cycle of panic and neglect? How we respond now and in the years to come will prove a critical test for Europe and the world,” he added.Mpox, a viral infection that causes pus-filled lesions and flu-like symptoms, is usually mild but can kill.The clade 1b variety has caused global concern because it seems to spread more easily through routine close contact.A case of the variant was confirmed last week in Sweden and linked to a growing outbreak in Africa, the first sign of its spread outside the continent. The WHO declared the recent outbreak of the disease a public health emergency of international concern after the new variant was identified.Kluge said that the focus on the new clade 1 strain will also help in the fight against the less severe clade 2 variety that has spreading globally since 2022, allowing Europe to improve its response through better health advice and surveillance.About 100 new cases of the clade 2 mpox strain are now being reported in the European region every month, added Kluge.Mpox transmits through close physical contact, including sexual contact, but unlike previous global pandemics such as Covid-19, there is no evidence it spreads easily through the air.Health authorities need to be on alert and flexible in case there are new, more transmissible clades or ones that change their transmission route, but there are no recommendations for people to wear masks, said WHO spokesperson Tarik Jasarevic. \nDusit Princess Kathmandu hosts a five-day trout festival featuring a menu of locally sourced trout dishes crafted by Chef Mondal and his team.\nA 10-year-old's enthusiasm for baking, fueled by televised cooking shows, inspires a journey of culinary self-discovery, highlighting the technicalities, challenges, and transformative power of home baking.\nThe Stonewall Riots of 1969 ignited the LGBTQIA+ rights movement, leading to the establishment of Inclusive Galaxy Restaurant in Kathmandu, a safe space for the queer community to gather, find support, and foster a sense of belonging and individuality.\nAditya Mishra, a Nepali chef in New York, is elevating Nepali cuisine through his restaurant 'The Sewing Tin', showcasing dishes like kachaila and lamb sekuwa, and aspiring to spread Nepali food globally.\nCeleus Baral, a young environment science student, runs an online baking shop, Bakeleus, where she creates unique baked goods using her background in environmental science and her passion for nature.\nKathmandu Valley's bustling city juxtaposes with the tranquil village of Khokana, renowned for its medieval streets, Sikali Temple, historical town, and traditional mustard oil mills.\n“How much oxygen do you have for the summit?”I think this is the kind of question a film producer would ask. But when you're on the mountain, the answer is never clear.I have worked for a long time in the film industry and different art areas, especially photography and engraving.Working in various fields and drawing inspiration from them has become a new normal for me. I have made this approach my way of life without even realising it.I took responsibility for producing the last movie I worked on and shot the behind-the-scenes footage for a documentary. By doing so, I witnessed the entire shooting process and the journey of a movie.In the snowy highlands of Turkey, we had to endure the consequences of the changing climate to shoot ‘About Dry Grasses’, directed by Nuri Bilge Ceylan. The highlands used to be snowy in January, but by the time we got there in the same month, there was no snow. Nature was changing. It was responding to what was happening—to what humanity had done to it. In the end, it snowed, and we shot the intense snow scenes we wanted. But since most of our days were sunny, unlike what the director wanted, we had to shoot in the sunset and sunrise hours. As crew members, we spent many days waiting for the sun to set.Production requires creating opportunities, finding solutions, and being creative for a work of art to come true. For this, patience, endurance, calmness, and timing are necessary. On the other hand, nature wanted us to listen to it and wait for the right time.During that time, I witnessed many of nature's lessons. For example, I experienced extreme cold for the first time. We endured temperatures ranging from -33 degrees to +55 degrees. By listening to nature, surrendering to its forces, and working within its limits, we managed to persevere.No matter how much you prepare or plan during the pre-production phase, if you are working in nature, remember that nature will always have the final say.The film was completed, released, and connected with audiences. Its success at Cannes 2023 was followed by my trip to the North Pole for my project. I returned with a mix of wonderful developments, joys, and challenges. During this process, I experienced life and death, happiness and sadness, losses and awards.I realised the value of being able to breathe comfortably a few days after my father's chemotherapy ended. Just a few days earlier, he had said, \"Well done, my daughter. I'm glad you went!\" All the anxiety and hard work, filled with fears at the beginning, were finally behind me.Before going to Everest, when I was on the verge of giving up, defeated by my fears, I remembered my father's words. Everest reminded me of what he said while struggling to breathe, adding a turning point to my life.What does it mean to say ‘life’s turning point?’ How many turning points can there be in life?Who am I, and what am I doing in this world? How well do I know my own limits? Can I find answers to these big questions? These thoughts sparked my dream of journeying to Everest. Now, after returning, I can say that it turned my life around.“How much oxygen do you need for the summit?” sounds more like “How much do you need to hold on to life?” How many reasons do you find that give meaning to your life, keep you alive, and allow you to breathe? How much can you endure in the face of obstacles, and can you keep believing that a solution will eventually come your way?Can these questions be separated from the idea of measuring and assessing something, from learning its quantity and financial value? Can everything be known with certainty? Should the journey be fully understood in advance, with all its promises laid out? Should it be viewed like a purchase with a price tag, asking, “Is this journey worth this much?”I had never trekked before and had no climbing experience. I had lived at sea level my entire life and had never been to a high altitude.However, this journey was not only about the physical climb but also an inner discovery. After losing my father to lung cancer, his breathing difficulties taught me the fragility of breath, life, and existence. I also mentally prepared myself for the physical challenges I might face. Despite all my concerns, could this journey help me understand the cycle of life and the resilience of the soul?So, how could I make this trek possible? How could I land in Nepal? Despite all the economic difficulties and the many things I felt needed organising, I did my best and believed in it.Since I was embarking on this journey, I felt I should share about my travels and inspire others.Starting with photography, cinema, and engraving, which are already integral parts of my life, I dreamed of documenting and sharing the inspiring aspects of this journey.After months of correspondence and dreaming, it all came true. Finally, I embarked on the journey with the goal of creating photographs, engravings, and documentaries. I learned a great deal from my travels in Nepal, from the people I met, and from every moments I witnessed. I felt incredibly fortunate to have been able to honour my father’s memory with the peace and serenity I experienced in the Himalayas.During my 15-day journey to Everest Base Camp, I encountered nature’s masterpieces at every turn. As concerns like “How will I endure?” and “How will I finish?” started to weigh on me, the mountains suddenly parted with the clouds and gazed down at me.It was amazing to witness the appearance of ‘Gods’ that I had never seen before, in such immense size and in such a close, awe-inspiring manner beside me during that silent walk.As someone who came from one of the most crowded cities in the world, Istanbul, while I struggled with my daily questions and uncertainties, trying to control everything, they stood there calmly, as if answering me.They were just there—before and after.My guide, Lakhpa Sherpa, always reminded me not to worry about how high we were, how long it would take to reach our accommodation, or what the weather would be like. He encouraged me to live in the moment, and he was right.He advised me to focus on my breathing, not to get thirsty, to eat enough, and to appreciate the extraordinary beauty of the journey. In the mountains, plans dissolve and each moment is embraced as it comes.All the good wishes, prayers, and everything encountered along the way were for the journey itself. The mountain was full of life, secrets, and everything I had wondered about.This 15-day journey to Everest Base Camp was a solo adventure, yet I wouldn't have been able to complete it without my guide, Lhakpa, and my porter. Additionally, I was fortunate enough to experience the hospitality, generosity, and honesty at Trekkers Paradise, which organised the entire journey and provided guidance.I witnessed how dedication and sincerity are crucial in completing a journey safely and healthily. Ghanshyam Sharma, from Trekkers Paradise and Sauraj Jhingan, a climber who summited the Everest in 2018, shared their experiences with me during the journey.They experienced the 2015 earthquake while they were at the Everest Base Camp.As a filmmaker, their role as actors, and attention to detail played a significant role in bringing my dream photography and documentary project to life.The sponsors of my journey were Turkish Airlines, The North Face, Apple, Canon, and Stanley. My supporters include Oscar International College and Nepal Film Campus. Throughout the journey, I shared many experiences, memories, and countless photos and images with my students.On my way back home after 21 days, I celebrated my birthday on the plane. From the right window, the Himalayas bid me farewell. I felt like I had opened a new chapter in my life, and I was certain that I would return.I had made many friends and memories in Nepal.For now, I will be working on a documentary and preparing for a photography and engraving exhibition titled ‘My Soul Beyond the Mountain’.To the Himalayas: This summer was spent with you, but we will meet again soon. \nWe spent five days in Sri Lanka two weeks ago, driving up and down the island, covering almost 70 percent of its territory. Our tour spanned over 1,000 kilometres, including hills, beach spots, and heritage and religious sites.Our first stop in Sri Lanka was Colombo’s Bandaranaike International Airport. We were greeted by a warm and humid breeze when we exited the airport. The host briefed us (a group of journalists) that heavy rainfall has affected areas across Sri Lanka since mid-May 2024. Rain and storms intensified on June 1, with the most significant effects in the south and west of the country. We were lucky to have no rain in the forecast.On the first night, we checked into the lavish Jetwing Lake resort, an opulent sanctuary amidst the lush landscape. The resort’s expansive grounds were a retreat, offering a glimpse of Sri Lanka's natural beauty. We feasted on delicious cuisine, every bite exploding with flavour, introducing us to the island’s famed culinary delights. On June 7, early morning, the sun shone brightly, previewing the promise of an incredible journey ahead. We set off early the following day, eager to explore the mysteries of this enchanting island. As we ventured further into the heart of Sri Lanka, the landscape revealed its majestic nature. We were astounded by seeing Pidurangala Rock, a 200-metre-high granite colossus just a kilometre north of Sigiriya. The short hike to Pidurangala Rock offered breathtaking views of Sigiriya and beyond. We climbed the steep steps and soon were rewarded with a breathtaking panoramic view of the surrounding landscape. It took us 30 minutes to climb. The sight took our breaths away and left us humbled in the presence of such grandeur. From the top are glorious vistas of the surrounding landscape and an incredible view of the majestic Sigiriya Rock. From there, Sigiriya Lion’s Rock is visible, standing alone. This was the place where demon king Ravana had his palace in the Treta Yuga. Believed to have been built 50 centuries ago, the palace is said to have had a unique lift for Ravana and his visitors. Ravana imprisoned Sita in one of the caves at the bottom of this humongous boulder. Sigiriya is a fifth-century fortress in Sri Lanka carved out of an inselberg, a hill of hard volcanic rock that soared high above the surrounding jungle. We spent two hours atop the rock, mainly taking photographs. We descended from Pidurangala Rock, filled with awe and a sense of accomplishment.The journey ahead seemed even more enticing as we ventured along the winding roads, heading towards our next destination.Cash-strapped Sri Lanka plunged into its worst financial crisis in more than seven decades in 2022, with a severe dollar shortage sending inflation soaring to a high of 70 percent, its currency to record lows, and its economy contracting 7.3 percent.Thanks to the growing number of tourists, Sri Lanka is now bouncing back.In Jetwing Lake, we met Kasun Pradeep Somasiri, a receptionist. He briefed us that the resort is now 50 percent occupied. “That’s a better figure now as we are recovering.”The travel and tourism sector is a significant income generator for Sri Lanka. However, the economic crisis, the Ukraine–Russia war, and China’s zero-Covid policy have jeopardised the industry.Tourism accounted for more than 12 percent of the country’s GDP in 2019 and was the third-largest source of foreign exchange reserves, behind worker remittances and the apparel industry.Sri Lanka was poised to be one of the world’s best holiday destinations due to its rich culture, wealth of natural resources, and diversity of accessible experiences.However, tourism-dependent Sri Lanka suffered its first major setback with the Easter bombings 2019. This led to the collapse of inbound tourism flows as international arrivals declined by 18 percent year-on-year, and tourist expenditure fell by 17.7 percent that year. This was immediately followed by two years of pandemic restrictions. Inbound visitors fell to just 116,600 in 2021.An acute balance of payments crisis forced Sri Lanka to preemptively default on foreign debt of over $50 billion in April 2022, triggering a crippling economic contraction with spiralling inflation.“Tourism is gaining momentum,” says Somasiri. “The British and Chinese have started to return to Sri Lanka.”January-August is the peak season for foreigners. “From December to April, local people travel for holiday purposes,” says Somasiri. Before we started the tour to other religious sites, our tour guide, Sampath Mayadunne, told us, “Don't take selfies with your back to Buddha.” Turning your back on a Buddha statue and some other religious sites to take photos and videos is a strict no-no.The most common sight across Sri Lanka is the tank cascades system, an ancient irrigation infrastructure. The system is a network of small tanks draining to large reservoirs that store rainwater and surface runoff for later use.“These infrastructures were built by its ancient kings over 2,000 years ago to solve the water scarcity in the country’s dry zone,” says Mayadunne.On day two, we travelled to Ranweli Spice Garden in Matale. This garden is famous for its rare spices and herbs. A tour of the gardens will show you the cultivation, harvesting, cleaning, and packaging process, as well as the health benefits and uses of the herbs.On the way, we saw a colourful Muthumariamman Hindu temple, boasting hundreds of detailed sculptures in a rich mosaic of colour.In Kandy, we visited the Temple of the Tooth Relic (Sri Dalada Maligawa), one of the most sacred places of worship in the Buddhist world. It was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1988.The temple sustained damage from bombings by Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna in 1989 and by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam in 1998. However, it was fully restored each time.We then headed to Jetwing St Andrew’s, a luxurious 5-star property in Sri Lanka’s hill country of Nuwara Eliya, situated at 1,900 metres above sea level. During our stay in Kandy, we immersed ourselves in the city's charm and the serenity of the countryside. On the third day, early morning, we travelled to Nuwara Eliya, the area famous for tea estates that give many Nepalis the feeling that they have come to Kanyam, Ilam, in eastern Nepal.We visited a tea factory called Damro Labookellie Tea Centre, the oldest tea centre in Sri Lanka. Due to its cold climate, it is the most important area for tea production in Sri Lanka.In this tea factory, they make white and black tea, while the green tea is processed in another tea factory and then sent to Damro.After the tea factory tour and the tea tasting, we headed to Galle, our next resting point.We encountered narrow, winding, and maze-like streets and alleys in Nuwara Eliya, known as ‘Little England’. The town has preserved almost all its British-era buildings and is calm and beautiful. On our way to Galle, at the roadside, our tour guide stopped us at the famed Sita temple, which has Hanuman's footprints and is the place where Sita, wife of Lord Rama, was held captive by the demon king Ravana after he abducted her from India.We were at Sita Eliya, a temple named Sri Seethai Amman.When we reached the Hindu temple, rich in vibrant colours and architectural elements, it was full of devotees. The water stream adjoining the temple is believed to be where Sita bathed. Large footprints are found on the stones in the stream, and there is a saying that those belong to Hanuman, who came spying to find Sita’s whereabouts.In Ella, Ravana’s waterfalls are significant in the Rama-Ravana story. The cascade charms visitors from all over the globe. The waterfall is easily accessible and is known to have hidden caves at the top, which are believed to have been used as Ravana's residence.The 25-metre-tall waterfall is a beautiful cascade that provides the perfect backdrop for a photo to remember your Ramayana trail adventures in Sri Lanka. A short pilgrimage tour ended there, and it was now time for an adventure. Though it was not part of our itinerary, our guide decided to tour us on a train ride.Though short, only six kilometres from Ella to Demodera, it was thrilling. Everyone screamed in unison like kids on a fair ride to hear the echoes in the dark every time we passed through the tunnels. The sound of the train is subtly different inside a tunnel. For the first-timer, the darkness and shouts inside the tunnels when the train passes would be scary, like a horror movie.The train we boarded wasn’t crowded, but people had already filled the doorway, ready for the scenic journey.With the shrill sound of a whistle, the train slowly pulled away from the platform at Ella, passing houses, coconut trees and green fields.As the train progressed, tourists and locals were leaning out the windows and crowding to hang out the doors. I joined the crowd and hung out on a train. A short excitement ended there.After lunch, we headed to Galle and reached Jetwing Lighthouse. As soon as our group entered the hotel, they shouted with excitement.The hotel is on a rocky outcrop three miles west of Galle. Waves crash over giant boulders in front of it and produce howling winds.We were at Galle’s 17th-century fort five minutes from the hotel on day four. In the Bay of Galle on the southwest coast of Sri Lanka, Galle Fort was built first in 1588 by the Portuguese and lavishly rebuilt by the Dutch during the 17th century. It is a historical, archaeological and architectural heritage monument that maintains a perfect appearance even after more than 436 years.We then reached Hikkaduwa Beach, a popular beach destination on the southern coast of Sri Lanka. On the way, we saw a 30-metre-high Big Buddha Statue. It is a replica of the 6th-century Buddhas of Bamiyan destroyed by the Taliban in Afghanistan. It was created using the earliest known sketches of the statue. It was built in remembrance of the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami victims.We then travelled through the 222-kilometre-long Southern Expressway, Sri Lanka's first expressway linking the capital, Colombo, with Galle, Matara, and Hambantota, significant cities south of the island.On day five, we reached Colombo, the capital of Sri Lanka. Jetwing Colombo Seven hosted us in the bustling capital. We took a city tour early morning and visited Bally's Casino at night.On day six, we returned to Kathmandu early in the morning on a Sri Lankan Airlines flight, the airline that organised the trip in coordination with Jetwing Hotels Limited, a Sri Lankan hotel chain.National flag carrier Nepal Airlines, in its previous avatar as Royal Nepal Airlines, used to operate direct flights to Colombo during the 1980s. However, the carrier suspended operations following an armed movement by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) in Sri Lanka. There had been no direct air links between the two countries for decades.In 2016, Himalaya Airlines started a chartered flight that lasted a few months due to low traffic movement between the two countries. Sri Lankan Airlines started operating direct flights to Kathmandu in August 2021.“The main objective of this media tour is to increase tourism in both countries for mutual benefit. We want to draw Nepalis for pilgrims and leisure activities,” says Nilina Pathirana, Country Manager at Srilankan Airlines in Nepal.“We have understood that Nepali travellers tend to travel to Bangkok, Vietnam, Malaysia, Dubai, and Maldives. Nepalis have quite minimal knowledge about Sri Lanka and the religious connection between Lanka and Nepal. We want to promote Nepal and Sri Lanka jointly. This will be a win-win business,” added Pathirana.The airline said it currently carries 60 percent of the passengers from Nepal to Sri Lanka and beyond destinations like Tokyo, Sydney, Melbourne, and other Middle Eastern destinations. The return airfare for a 3.5-hour-long flight starts at Rs74,000. “We have a four-night, five-day package that begins from Rs80,000, depending on the properties and extended itineraries,” says Pathirana.Nepalis must submit certain required documents for visa processing, like their passport copy and bank statement. Due to this government-to-government policy, only Nepalis must obtain a prior visa. Otherwise, Sri Lankans are required to have a visa upon arrival.“The other best thing is that Sri Lankan Airlines can be involved with the visa process or facilitate the Nepalis tourists. Our main intention is to have a sustainable market in Kathmandu and make it a daily flight,” says Pathirana. \nMundhum Trek in Koshi province in the eastern part of Nepal is a new cultural walking trail. It passes through several indigenous ethnic villages and landscapes in Khotang and Bhojpur districts. This trail goes up to an elevation of 4,200 metres to the viewpoint of Silchung Peak and takes one through the settlements of the Kirati people. This route starts from Diktel Bazaar and passes through beautiful settlements like Chakhewa, Rawa Dhap, Salpa Bhanjyang, Silchung and Hanspokhari before ending in Bhojpur. There are some hotels in Diktel but trekkers are advised to carry tents. The trail offers panoramic views of most of the eight-thousanders, including Everest, Lhotse, Makalu, Cho Oyu and Kanchenjunga mountains. The spring season, March through May, is highly recommended for the trek.Janaki Mandir Janaki Mandir at Janakpur in Madhesh province was constructed in 1874 and is a blend of Mughal and local architecture. The temple is a three-storey building and has 60 rooms, making it the largest temple in Nepal. Pilgrims flock here by the thousands to pay homage to Janaki Mandir—Janaki being the other name of Sita, the daughter of King Janak. The temple houses an idol of Sita which was found near Ayodhya, the kingdom of Ram. The marriage anniversary of Lord Ram and Sita is celebrated in Janakpur every year on Vivaha Panchami, which falls in December. In the southwest corner of Janaki Mandir is the Vivaha Mandap, which has been built at the site where the marriage of Ram and Sita is said to have taken place. Another well-known temple in the vicinity is Ram Mandir, which is built in pagoda style and is hence different from the other temples in Janakpur that generally bear resemblance to Mughal architecture. It houses a female statue, said to be of Yogamaya, which has the reputation of being one of the most beautiful images of female forms in Nepal. Other holy sites of interest include the Laxman Temple, Sankat Mochan Temple and Hanuman Temple.Kuri Village, Kalinchok Kuri village, a popular tourist destination around 150 km from Kathmandu, lies at an altitude of 3,842 metres above sea level in Kalinchowk of Dolakha district, in Bagmati province. People visit the place to enjoy the snow during the winter besides the mesmerising landscapes and splendid panoramic view of the Himalayan range. Kalinchok gets snow mainly at the end of December and the snowfall continues till the end of February or mid-March. When there is snow, it is difficult for jeeps, buses and cars to reach the top of Kuri village. Chains are wrapped around the wheels of vehicles and specially modified jeeps with highly experienced drivers are used to carry visitors. There are several hotels and restaurants in the area. The road up to Kuri has also improved over the years.Annapurna Base Camp Annapurna Base Camp trek, in Gandaki province, makes for a picturesque journey that takes you to the foothills of the Annapurna South, up to 4,130 metres above sea level. The five-day trek (seven days for slow walkers) offers rich cultural diversities, typical Nepali villages and the flora and fauna nestled at the foothills of Annapurna. The distance from Pokhara to Annapurna Base Camp is approximately 81 kilometres. It is among the shortest and most budget-friendly treks in Nepal. For Nepalis, lodging costs around $5 to $10 per day. For foreigners, the overall cost of the trek ranges from $800 to $1500 on average per person. Annapurna Base Camp trek can be done at any time throughout the year as each season offers a different trekking experience. The ideal time for the trek depends on your weather preferences and what you expect from it. However, autumn (September to October) and spring (March to May) are considered the two best seasons for the trek, as the days at the time are warm and bright with clear skies.Bardiya National Park Bardiya National Park, located in the southern Tarai belt of Lumbini province, is home to one of the most elusive and majestic animals on earth—the Royal Bengal Tiger. The park, which covers an area of 968 square kilometres, is considered one of the most important protected areas in the country. It is a prime destination for those looking to catch a glimpse of a tiger. A bit of luck and patience will offer a good chance to see the Bengal Tiger. The jungle safari also offers one the opportunity to spot Asian elephants and the greater one-horned rhinoceros. The rare Gangetic river dolphins are occasionally spotted on rafting trips along the Geruwa River, the eastern channel of the Karnali river. Besides, visitors can enjoy the homestays and explore local Tharu culture. The right time to visit the park is from mid-September to mid-December and mid-February to May.Khaptad National Park Khaptad National Park in Sudurpaschim province is a protected area in the far western region. It stretches over four districts of Bajhang, Bajura, Achham and Doti and ranges in elevation from 1,400 to 3,300 metres. The park can be visited throughout the year. Trekkers are advised to bring their tents, food and other supplies. The Nepal Tourism Board says of late, social media has been increasingly influencing Nepali travellers to go to Khaptad. Since the far-flung Khaptad National Park is still offbeat for many travellers, the area remains pristine and fresh. The seasons of spring (March-May) and autumn (October-November) are the ideal times to visit the park. The temperature ranges from 10°c to 20°c offering pleasant trekking weather. The monsoon begins in June and lasts until September and during this time, roads often become muddy and slippery. From December to February, winter brings snow and chilling winds to the park.Limi Valley \nOnce again, my heart swelled with joy when my hometown came into view.Arriving at Lalikharka after the treacherous journey through Pauwa Bhanjyang and the bustling Kanchhi Dokan, Phidim, the headquarters of Panchthar district, revealed itself like a surprise gift. My home town, Phidim, is unique in the fact that it reveals to travellers approaching it from uphill. As the vehicle descends the mountain road, it slowly comes into view, its houses and buildings recognisable for the native son.This Dashain, I undertook the much-awaited trip to my hometown with my wife Kabita and daughter Aarohi. Little did I anticipate the transformation that awaited me.The moment I got out of the jeep, I noticed that Phidim, nestled in the lush hills, has undergone a remarkable transformation over the years. As I guided my family to my home, which had suffered damages in the 1989 quake that struck eastern Nepal, I found that old, mud and stone houses had been replaced by concrete buildings. The place was vastly different from the one I remembered.Arriving at my childhood home felt like reuniting with an old friend. Navigating its nooks and crannies with my daughter, we delved into the history of the house, a symbol of my cherished memories.My wife had visited Phidim years ago, spending a month with my parents. She, too, recalled beautiful moments she had had in the town. I asked the tenant about the neighbours and acquaintances. Some had died, while others had left for good.A call to local journalist Giriraj Banskota led me to the school grounds, where memories flooded back. This was where I spent my teenage years, playing ball, learning to kick, and watching major tournaments. Here, I even encountered a group of Western climbers headed to Kanchenjunga, the world’s third-highest mountain. I remember being awed by their shiny yellow tents, headlights and strange smell. I remember practising my tutephuteko Angrezi with the climbers. Birendra Shield, an annual sports tournament named after the late king, brought ace players from various schools in Panchthar district. The district also hosted Yuba Mela, an annual three-day fair to commemorate the birthday of the king, organising football tournaments in which teams from as far as Sunsari and Taplejung participated. I never excelled at dribbling balls. A boy growing up in a seven-member family, I soon found my interest in literature. In the late 1980s, Phidim hosted a major literary festival. In the run-up to the 1990 pro-democracy protest, walls were painted with anti-monarchy slogans, local politicians were arrested. I took my family to my school, Naya Namuna Secondary School. It was Saturday, so the school was closed. I peeked through the steel gate and wall, imagining myself labouring over classes. Memories are hazy, but what I remember most is going out of the school—to quiz contests with me leading the school team, to essay competitions at the District Education Office and to play carom board, a national pastime, in a nearby shopfront. Returning to the main street, the demolition of a landmark gate made me reflect on how cities transform, shedding old landmarks for new identities. Navigating narrow alleyways, I felt like a stranger in my own hometown. Multistory buildings have emerged and roads have been paved, reshaping the town. It’s the same place with a different face, leaving me nostalgic for the Phidim of my memories.We finally reached Shivalaya temple, which I told my wife and daughter was one of my cherished hangouts. A giant statue of Falgunanda (the Kirant leader’s birthday is celebrated on November 10) stood before the steps to the temple. Though my wife suspected I came here to smoke, in reality, I visited the temple in the evening to meet friends and talk about issues that mattered most to us at the time. It also offered a panoramic view of the town (I could not take my family to Gadhi Danda, a hillock across the Shivalaya).Towards the end of my journey, I felt sad about Phidim’s lack of prospects. To my dismay, I found that people have been leaving the town in droves. Despite blacktopped roads and multi-story buildings, Phidim faces a troubling reality. The lack of quality higher education and specialist healthcare has driven people away, echoing the circumstances that led me to Kathmandu years ago. Conversations with locals confirmed a mass exodus from the town, a trend that raises concerns about Phidim's future.My conversations with familiar strangers led me to conclude that Phidim has transformed into a transit town for pilgrims heading to Pathibhara Devi Temple, which is around 255 kilometres north in Taplejung district. I met dozens of people headed to the holy site. While pilgrims see it as a stopover, for me, it was a homecoming. The realisation dawned that Phidim is, perhaps, in a state of transition, trading its rustic charm for the hallmarks of urbanisation. While I left Phidim for higher education in Kathmandu, people from rural areas have flocked to the town in search of better opportunities, bringing life and energy to the once quiet community.As we bid adieu to my hometown, I couldn’t help but reflect on the inevitability of leaving a place, no matter how enamoured one is with it. Passing Kanchhi Dokan, I pointed out Kanchnajungha and Kumbhakarna to my daughter—symbols of my childhood. Phidim, now a blend of nostalgia and change, remains etched in my heart, a testament to the intricate dance between memory and evolution. \nBangladesh wrote a new chapter in South Asian football history on Wednesday as they defeated hosts Nepal 4-1 in the final at the ANFA Complex in Lalitpur to win their maiden SAFF U-20 Championship title.Mirajul Islam scored a brace, Rabby Hossen Rahul added the third and Piash Ahmmed Nova rounded off a ruthless victory with their fourth goal as the Bengal Tigers finally got hands on the trophy nine years after the inception of the championship. Nepal and India had shared the titles of the previous five editions, with India winning the last three tournaments in a row. Bangladesh were the finalists in 2017, 2019 and 2022.Backed by home support, and with defending champions India already out of the competition, Nepal started as strong favourites—having also beaten the Tigers 2-1 in the group stage—and were looking to reclaim the throne.But Urjan Shrestha’s side were so wasteful and took too lightly a Bangladeshi team that had undone India in the semi-finals.Nirajan Dhami was the biggest threat to Bangladesh in the first half, constantly bullying the opponents’ post with his long rangers.Md Asif, the shootout hero of India semi-final, started in the place of captain and first choice goalkeeper Mehdi Hasan Srabon, who was out injured, and passed another big test denying Dhami his third goal of the tournament with a finger-tip save thirteen minutes into the game.Nepal’s biggest chance of the match came in the 21st minute when Dhami outmuscled two defenders, bulldozed into the area and cut back for unmarked Abinash Syangtan but the midfielder failed to capitalise on the open chance from near the penalty spot to everyone’s disbelief.Bangladesh then punished Nepal for that miss in the injury time of the first half with a clinical freekick from Mirajul, whose shot from just outside the edge of the box hit the upright before finding the net.The lead injected so much energy into Bangladesh that they were all over Nepal after the restart.Although Nepal pressed for equaliser immediately and Dhami again came close to goal, it was Bangladesh who proved to be a better team with their second goal in the 55th minute thanks to Mirajul, who outsmarted Nepali defenders to head in from goal line after Nepal goalkeeper Jiyarat Shekh misjudged a tight-angled effort from Asadul Molla. Mirajul scored four goals to top the goal-scoring tally in the championship.The two-goal deficit soaked all the life out of Nepal and Bangladesh took full advantage of it, adding another in the 71st minute. Mirajul was the provider as the forward outfoxed three Nepali defenders to set up Rahul to poke home, ending any hopes of Nepali comeback.Samir Tamang gave some hopes of a fight back, reducing the deficit in the 80th minute with a free header after Bangladesh goalie Asif unsuccessfully attempted to punch away Ram Thapa’s cross.Nepal still had time to claw their way back but never rediscovered their composure.Nova then put the final nail in the coffin, sending the ball through the legs of Shekh in the sixth minute of stoppage time after he was set up by Rahul.Mirajul was also declared the most valuable player of the tournament, while Asif won the best goalkeeper award.Nepal received the fair play award.Bangladesh U-20 team coach AKM Maruful Haque, who also coached senior men’s national football team in 2015 during the 2015 SAFF Suzuki Cup, dedicated the trophy to “the heroes and their souls who sacrificed their lives for the sake of new Bangladesh this and last month”.“I hope this championship will inspire the nation to reform Bangladesh,” he added.On the final and the championship, Haque said: “I had told my players to start slow and play simple football because we only had a one-day rest… and because we were playing against a very talented side. We were successful at the end.” \nTen-man Bangladesh progressed into the final of the SAFF U-20 Championship after they defeated defending champions India 4-3 on penalties following a 1-1 draw at the ANFA Complex in Lalitpur on Monday.Bangladesh threw away a first-half lead from Asadul Molla to Rickey Meetei Haobam’s 75th minute equaliser and had to rely on substitute goalkeeper Md Asif’s heroics in the shootout to reach their second consecutive final.The Bengal Tigers now dream of lifting their first ever trophy of the SAFF age-group competition after coming close in 2017, 2019 and 2023.But they will have to overcome a huge challenge from a dogged and spirited Nepal. With India out of the competition, their bid for reclaiming the throne from India has now been made easy.Nepal fought back to beat Bhutan 4-1 on penalties on Sunday after their semi-final battle ended in a 1-1 draw.Only Nepal and India have won the SAFF age-group championship title since its inception in 2015, with the latter winning the last three editions. Nepal won the first two.Nepal will also be full of confidence for the title battle, having beaten Bangladesh 2-1 in the group stage, and will be aiming to reclaim the throne.For Bangladesh, it will be a grudge match, a second chance to take care of an unfinished business and write a new chapter in South Asian football history.The stakes will be high.At Satdobato, India started as favourites and were the first to threaten when Gwgwmsar Goyaray sneaked past the Bangladesh defence and charged at goal with his left-footed strike from close range but goalkeeper and captain Md Mehdi Hasan Srabon came to the rescue with a brilliant save.India kept applying pressure on Bangladesh half but struggled to find any clear chances.Bangladesh were also lacklustre but did not throw away the only chance they got as Molla pounced on a goalkeeping error from Priyansh Dubey to slam from close range—credit to Md Rabby Hossen Rahul who outsmarted Thomas Kanamoottil Cherian to send a low cross that tricked outstretching Dubey before finding the feet of Molla.India had some moments in the final minutes of the first half but could not penetrate the Bangladesh defence line.India switched to a more aggressive mode after the break and it soon started to pay dividends as Bangladesh had to survive a series of attacks.Manglenthang Kipgen curling effort almost found the inside of the net in the 52nd minute.Korou Singh Thingujam should have equalised two minutes later when he only had Srabon to beat but his shot from inside the area flashed wide.Thanglalsoun Gangte then reached twice closer to goal, testing Srabon with a powerful shot and hitting the upright.Bangladesh looked determined not to let their lead slip away easily and made a goal line clearance to deny Goyary in the 64th minute but their first choice goalkeeper Srabon had to be stretchered off after sustaining an injury while trying to foil Goyary’s effort.India took full advantage of it and squared the game in the 75th minute. Naoba Meitei Pangambam utilised the opportunity of a poor defending from Kamacai Marma Aky and cut back for Haobam to send a low ball through the crowded area, giving Asif no chance.Bangladesh received another hammer blow in the fifth minute of added time as Aky was sent off for badly challenging India goalkeeper Dubey.But Asif, who came on crisis and gave away the lead, found redemption in the shootout as he denied Gangte and Akash Tirkey to take Bangladesh into the final. \nNewcastle United’s Anthony Gordon equalised 14 minutes from time to secure a 1-1 draw at Bournemouth in the Premier League on Sunday and spoil their hosts’ 125th anniversary celebrations.Marcus Tavernier put Bournemouth ahead in the first half but Gordon stole in at the back post to steer home a 76th-minute cross from substitute Harvey Barnes to ensure a deserved share of the spoils.Newcastle advanced to four points from their opening two games of the season. Bournemouth drew their first match at Nottingham Forest.Bournemouth, hoping for a win to mark their anniversary festivities, had the ball in the net in stoppage time for what looked initially to be a dramatic late winner but Dango Ouattara’s effort was ruled out for handball after a VAR check.Ouattara rose powerfully but a check showed the ball hit him on the top of his arm as he went up for the header and it was disallowed to the frustration of the home fans.It was Newcastle who looked more likely to snatch a winner, however, with Bournemouth goalkeeper Neto making several key stops to deny Alexander Isak, Joelinton and a header from centre-back Dan Burn in the closing stages.Bournemouth’s lead came after Antoine Semenyo had stolen possession from Joelinton and worked the ball past three defenders before setting up a tap-in for Tavernier.Joelinton was caught midway in his own half by the Bournemouth winger, who looked to have taken on too much as he stormed in at goal but managed to get a square pass to Tavernier when surrounded by three defenders.Semenyo, who struck the crossbar in the first half, was close to another assist in the 64th minute but his pass from the wing was miscued by a sliding Evanilson at the back post.Bournemouth’s record signing was making his debut in one of five changes from last week’s line-up but Evanilson’s two other efforts on goal were easily dealt with by home goalkeeper Nick Pope and he was taken off after 72 minutes.Madueke hits hat-trick as Chelsea thrash Wolves 6-2 Noni Madueke silenced the boos with a second-half hat-trick all assisted by Cole Palmer as Chelsea crushed Wolverhampton Wanderers 6-2 away in a frenetic Premier League clash at Molineux on Sunday.Chelsea’s first Premier League points of the season and the first for new manager Enzo Maresca arrived in spectacular fashion as the visitors ripped Wolves apart after the break following an absorbing first period.Maresca’s side led twice in the first half with goals by Nicolas Jackson and Palmer but both times Wolves deservedly hit back through Matheus Cunha and Jorgen Strand Larsen.Wolves fell apart after the break, however, and Madueke took the game beyond them with three goals in 15 minutes.Joao Felix came off the bench to mark his return to the club with his side’s sixth goal.Much has been made of Chelsea’s huge squad assembled at massive cost and the baffling puzzle Italian Maresca has been hired to solve, but the youthful side he sent out on Sunday including nine players aged 23 or under gelled impressively.Madueke was the villain for the home fans in more ways than one. The English forward was booed from the start after a deleted social media post in which he insulted the city of Wolverhampton.He silenced the hecklers in emphatic fashion, however, to get Chelsea’s league campaign up and running after their opening defeat by champions Manchester City.With Wolves in disarray, Pedro Neto, who left them for Chelsea in the summer, teed up Felix for a cool finish.Slot off to winning start at home as Liverpool cruise past Brentford Arne Slot’s comfortable start to life as Liverpool manager continued when his new side strolled to a 2-0 victory over Brentford in the Premier League on Sunday.Liverpool dominated early on, scoring a fine opening goal on the counterattack when Luis Diaz arrowed his first of the season into the top corner with 13 minutes on the clock.Brentford responded well, going close with two short-range headers either side of halftime, but Mohamed Salah ended the visitors’ hopes of taking anything from their trip to Anfield with a second goal 20 minutes from time.Dutchman Slot now has two 2-0 wins from two games as he undertakes the difficult task of replacing Juergen Klopp as Liverpool boss, with a testing trip to Manchester United up next.“The time with Juergen (was) amazing and the time with the new boss is a joy and he has a certain way of playing,” Liverpool captain Virgil van Dijk told Sky Sports.Before Sunday, no Liverpool boss since Graeme Souness in 1991 had secured wins in their two opening league games in charge.Brentford, without star striker Ivan Toney in the squad again as speculation over his future continues, grew into the contest, but could not make a sustained spell of pressure before halftime count.Liverpool upped the ante after the break and deservedly got their second goal, with Salah adding to his strike on the opening day at Ipswich Town with another well-taken shot to seal the victory.Salah is now Liverpool’s outright fifth top scorer at Anfield in all competitions with 118 goals, moving ahead of Robbie Fowler as he again looks primed to be front and centre of a Red title tilt. \nNepal stormed into the final of the SAFF U-20 Championship after they defeated ten-man Bhutan 4-1 on penalties following a 1-1 draw at the ANFA Complex in Lalitpur on Sunday.Nepal goalkeeper Jiyarat Shekh was the hero of the shootout. He stopped penalties from Jigme Namgyel and Ugyen Dorji and scored the decisive penalty kick, sending Nepal into their third final of the competition.Nepal will face defending champions India or Bangladesh, who meet in the second semi-final clash on Monday, in the title match on Wednesday.The defeat also ended Bhutan’s hopes of reaching their first ever final of the SAFF age-group competition. They reached the semi-finals in 2017, 2019 and 2023.Bhutan were a better side and kept Nepal under pressure most of the first half but could not create any clear chance at goal.Nepal were also lacklustre before the break and could not really threaten the Bhutan post.But the game suddenly burst into life eleven minutes into the second half, when Jetsuen Dorji intercepted a poor pass from Semanta Thapa and launched a thunderstrike from outside the edge of the penalty area. Nepal goalie Shekh was completely aware of the incoming shot and could have done better but let the ball slip with his misguided effort.Nepal immediately felt a sense of urgency after conceding and their constant pressure on the opponents was rewarded with two freekicks from dangerous range after 70 minutes.Abinash Syangtan failed to convert both freekicks but his first attempt was a further warning of what Nepal could do as Bhutan’s goalkeeper Lhocho Nima had to work really hard to keep the shot away.Nepal continued to apply pressure and it earned them their first reward as Kinzang Tenzin was sent off for a second yellow after harshly challenging Sabin Ghimire in the middle of the pitch.Tenzin’s departure proved costly for Bhutan as Nepal equalised only six seconds after the match resumed.Semanta tossed the resulting freekick for Lachhu Thapa, who sent a long ball into the six yard box for Dhami to head home with an incredible back-header.Samir Tamang almost put the game to bed in the 90th minute but his header off a long pass from Ram Thapa missed the goal by inches.Bhutan had a golden opportunity to shock Nepal in the fifth minute of injury time when Semanta’s poor attempt to clear the ball fell straight to the path of Namgyel. But the midfielder could not capitalise on the chance from near the spot kick, as the game went to tiebreaker. \nTop Chinese and U.S. officials discussed holding fresh talks between their heads of state in the near future, Chinese state media said on Wednesday, after China's top diplomat, Wang Yi, met U.S. national security adviser Jake Sullivan in Beijing.Both sides also agreed to hold video calls between their military theatre commanders \"at an appropriate time\", according to the Chinese readout from the meetings, a move that Washington hopes could prevent conflict in areas like the Taiwan Strait.\"The key to the smooth development of China-U.S. interaction lies in treating each other as equals,\" Wang told Sullivan according to state broadcaster CCTV.This is Sullivan's second day of talks with Wang and others, aimed at calming tensions between the two superpowers ahead of the Nov. 5 U.S. election.The meetings will last until Thursday and are expected to cover a range of areas where the two countries are at odds, including trade, the Middle East, Ukraine, and Chinese territorial claims from Taiwan to the South China Sea.Wang told Sullivan the U.S. should \"stop arming Taiwan and support peaceful 'reunification' of China\", adding that \"Taiwan belongs to China and that 'Taiwan independence' is the biggest risk to peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait\".According to the Chinese readout, Wang also expressed Beijing's disapproval of U.S. tariffs on a range of manufactured goods and export controls targeting Chinese chip makers, saying Washington should \"stop jeopardizing China's legitimate interests\".SOUTH CHINA SEAChina, the world's second-largest economy, whose vessels have repeatedly clashed with Philippine ships in the South China Sea, said the U.S. \"must not undermine China's sovereignty...nor support Philippines' 'infringing acts'\".Manila and Washington have a mutual defence treaty and the U.S. has vowed to aid the Philippines against armed attacks on its vessels and soldiers in the South China Sea.In the final months of his presidency, U.S. President Joe Biden has pushed direct diplomacy to influence Chinese President Xi Jinping to help keep tensions at bay. U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic candidate in November's election, would likely pursue a similar strategy if she succeeds Biden.In April, Biden and Xi navigated their countries' disagreements in a phone call, after deciding to significantly improve bilateral ties during a summit in San Francisco last November following a period of deep division over trade and the COVID pandemic.However, many analysts aligned with Republican former president Donald Trump see that approach as too soft, in the face of a more assertive Chinese foreign policy. Trump is his party's presidential candidate again in the November election.The U.S. also wants China to take more action at home to prevent the development of chemicals that can be made into fentanyl, the leading cause of U.S. drug overdoses, and reach an understanding on safety standards for artificial intelligence. \nIn 2008 Matina Shakya was only three years old when she was appointed as the Kumari of Kathmandu. She was succeeded by Trishna Shakya as the new Kumari in 2017.Kumaris are revered as goddesses of beauty and strength in certain Hindu and Buddhist traditions. Worshipping young girls as Kumaris is a 2,000-year-old practice in Nepal. Since the 13th century, when the Malla kings ruled, the Newars of the Kathmandu Valley have been worshipping Kumari, a girl from the Shakya/Bajracharya community chosen to embody the divine energy of goddess Taleju Bhawani. The reign of a Kumari ends when she starts menstruating. So long as she is serving as the Kumari, she is believed to be the nation’s divine protector, safeguarding it from evil. Matina, 18, is now in her first year of college, studying for a bachelor’s degree in management. Her father, Pratapman Shakya, when asked about having a daughter who is the only living the goddess in the world said, “Not having your own daughter live in the same house as you seemed a little unfair, but we feel very proud to call ourselves the parents of the royal Kumari who is revered by people all over the world.”On March 9, 2023, he, along with Matina, were getting ready for a special function held to honour all former Kumaris from across Nepal. “There are often events to honour Matina as she was the royal Kumari, but this one was dedicated to all former Kumaris from different areas. There are 129 living Kumaris in all,” he added. Besides Kathmandu, Kumari tradition is followed in Bhaktapur, Lalitpur, and Kirtipur, among other cities.According to him, this was the first time an event like this was organised and the Deputy Mayor of Kathmandu, Sunita Dangol, was also in attendance.Throughout the year, many people line up outside the ‘Kumari Ghar’ to get a chance to visit the Kumari and get her blessings. Many foreigners stand out in the yard to catch a glimpse of her. Nepali people believe that if a Kumari smiles at you, it is a bad omen.Everyday, a tutor visits the Kumari to help her continue with her education as she is not allowed to step outside the Kumari Ghar. She takes her exams and does her homework from the Kumari Ghar itself. She also has the freedom to play inside the Kumari Ghar. Many former kumaris have pursued careers in their fields of interest or studied after their term ends, and they continue to be treated with the same respect. The tradition of Kumari has evolved over time. In the past Kumaris did not enjoy these freedoms.Because of various superstitious beliefs, Kumaris were not fully educated and were forbidden from getting married because of the belief that the groom would die soon if he married an ex-Kumari. They led secluded lives, were restricted from participating in normal childhood activities, and focused solely on their religious duties.However, now, these myths have been dispelled. Modern understanding has shifted to recognise that Kumaris, after stepping down from their divine role, have the freedom to marry and lead a normal life. The perception of Kumaris as isolated figures has evolved, with a focus on providing them with a more balanced upbringing. There have been initiatives to integrate Kumaris into regular social and educational settings, allowing them to have a more holistic and fulfilling childhood experience. “Matina was already familiar with the students from the school that she attended after her term as Kumari ended,” said Shakya. “The kids visited the Kumari Ghar frequently so that she could have a smooth transition,” he added. According to Gautam Prasad Shakya, who has been living as a caretaker in the Kumari Ghar, the changes made to the tradition are minor. “The traditions of Kumari have mostly stayed the same. All the rituals are still practised like in the old days,” he said.On 6 May 2005, Pun Devi Maharjan, a lawyer, filed a case in the Supreme Court claiming that the traditional practice of electing young girls as Kumaris, or “goddesses’, who are expected to follow certain social restrictions and appear at religious festivals, violated the rights of the child. Quoting Maharjan’s complaint, Puskar Mathema writes in Yuwamanch Monthly of October 2007, “If Kumari tradition is continued, it will undermine the fundamental rights as well the freedoms of children guaranteed by the constitution and child rights treaties. Apart from this, it will have a negative impact on their physical and mental development.”The case continued while Nepal overthrew the monarchy and declared itself a secular state in 2007. When the judgement was pronounced in 2008, the goddess was still in her role, now giving blessings to the country’s President. The court ordered that the Kumaris and ex-Kumaris receive better benefits and arrangements and ordered the government to improve their support and allowances.In April 2006, Prof Chunda Bajracharya filed a petition at the Supreme Court against Maharjan’s petition, who had argued against the Kumari tradition. Bajracharya contended that the tradition should be preserved as heritage due to its over 100 years of history.“People who don’t understand the culture shouldn’t comment on it,” she stated. Bajracharya also criticised the human right activists who contended that Kumaris were only allowed to wear the colour red. “People who say Kumaris are forced to wear red clothing all the time, are the same people who send their kids to schools in uniform,” she said.“After the 2008 court verdict, there have been a lot of improvements. Now, a teacher visits the Kumari Ghar daily to tutor the Kumari, who is expected to complete school assignments and sit periodic exams. All the former Kumaris now get benefits like scholarships and special pensions,” she added.Bajracharya is currently a professor of literature at the Tribhuvan University in Kathmandu.“The only significant change that the court verdict brought to the tradition was in terms of her education,” said Gautam Prasad Shakya, the caretaker. “Kumaris were tutored long before the case, but the case helped formalise this arrangement. After the court verdict, the time between 12 pm and 4 pm was designated as the Kumari’s tuition time,” he added.After the verdict, there was a concerted effort to provide Kumaris with access to quality education, enabling them to develop the skills and knowledge needed to lead fulfilling lives beyond their divine roles. There was also a shift towards ensuring that the Kumari's living quarters are comfortable, safe, and conducive to her overall well-being.Moreover, the selection process for the Kumari underwent reforms in the aftermath of the Pun Devi Maharjan case. There was a push for greater transparency, accountability, and inclusivity in the selection of the Kumari, with an emphasis on ensuring that the process was fair, respectful, and free from undue influence.Efforts were made to support their transition into adulthood, including providing them with comprehensive resources for education, vocation, and social integration. This shift aimed to address the challenges faced by former Kumaris and empower them to lead independent and fulfilling lives after their divine service.“The Kumari tradition has evolved over time. During the tenure of my daughter, we saw a lot of improvements. Even after her time as Kumari, Matina continued to get a lot of government support,” said Shakya, former Kumari Matina’s father.“Some people argue that child rights are being violated, but all of her rights are being upheld inside the Kumari Ghar. This is a unique and respected aspect of Nepali culture, and I don’t believe it violates any of my child’s rights.”While the Kumari tradition continues, its practices have evolved. “She enjoys this normal life and it didn’t take her long to adjust as well,” says Matina’s father, on her transition from the revered Kumari to the ordinary Matina. \nWhat animals did Juddha Shumsher have in his zoo?“We only have records of animals from the mid-1960s,” says Ganesh Koirala, who has been employed at the Central Zoo for the past 36 years and currently serves as its information officer and programme officer. “That too I hand-copied from an old torn-down file that I came across.”Today, the Central Zoo, which sprawls across six hectares in Jawalakhel, Lalitpur, houses as many as 1,298 wild animals of different species of mammals, reptiles, fishes and birds from Nepal and around the world—from tiger, rhinoceros, hippopotamus and red panda to its recent attraction: a pair of chimpanzees.After enduring decades of neglect under various government bodies, with its animals and infrastructure scraping along in a deplorable state, the zoo received a new lease of life with improved infrastructure and animal care in 1995, when it came under the management of the King Mahendra Trust for Nature Conservation (KMTNC), now known as the National Trust for Nature Conservation, in 1995.Today, the Central Zoo is an entertainment venue, one of the most happening places in the Kathmandu valley. Flocked by thousands of daily visitors, the zoo now also hosts rescued animals and those in need of rehabilitation. It is also a site for conservation education.But when Juddha Shumsher Rana (prime minister from 1932–1945) built the Jawalakhel Zoological Garden on the premises of his Jawalakhel Durbar (where Nepal Administrative Staff College stands today) in 1932, he did so purely for private interests—as a space of entertainment and amusement for him and his family.Built in the semi-wilderness of Jawalakhel around a historical pond dating to the 17th century during the reign of King Siddhi Narsingh Malla, the zoo also became the space he could use to show his respect for two women he revered, his mother and sister-in-law, and indulge in one of his favourite pastimes—gambling.Today, the Central Zoo, nestled in the heart of Jawalakhel's sprawling crowd, does not go unnoticed, and its story is well told. But what passions drove Juddha to build the zoo? What was its original layout? What animals did it have in the beginning? And how did Juddha spend time there?“I remember once seeing a small board that read ‘Jawalakhel Zoological Garden’,” Koirala says. “I don’t know whether it was from Juddha’s time or was made in the later years. It must surely be that Juddha built the zoo out of influence from the British given how this term was used by them.”Koirala adds, “There is a former employee, now an elderly gentleman who worked in the zoo in the 1960s. He surely has some stories from Juddha’s time.”Birds, beasts and palacesTo trace the birth of Jawalakhel Zoological Garden, one has to look at the history of Nepal’s rulers owning birds and animals.Like rulers around the world, Nepal’s royalty kept wild and exotic birds and animals in captivity as a source of pleasure and mark of wealth and power. The book ‘Social History of Nepal’ by historians TR Vaidya, Tri Ratna Manandhar and Shankar Lal Joshi details how Mallas during the mediaeval Kathmandu Valley to Ranas and Shahs in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries owned rare, exotic creatures. In 1708, a rhinoceros in Kathmandu Valley broke the iron chain in which it was bound and killed its tamer. In 1714, Bhaktapur’s King Bhupatindra Malla gifted a camel and an elephant to Kantipur’s King Bhaskar Malla to build peace.Among Shahs, King Rana Bahadur Shah in particular was reputed for his collection of birds and animals. He also owned a zoo outside his palace in Basantapur Durbar Square, where the Nepal Bank Limited stands in New Road today. The zoo contained “tiger, bear, monkey, elephant, horse, deer… heron, peacock… pigeon, wild dogs, rabbits, rats, mongoose.”Jung Bahadur Rana’s zoo on the premises of his Thapathali Durbar hosted a variety of birds and animals collected during his hunting expeditions as well as those brought from abroad. Jung Bahadur himself used to “supervise and inspect it”. Juddha Shumsher likewise had his own collection of creatures which steadily expanded into a zoological garden. Seeking wilderness in his Jawalakhel DurbarJuddha’s biographer Ishwari Prasad writes in ‘The Life and Times of Maharaja Juddha Shumsher Jung Bahadur Rana’ that between 1933 and 1940, Juddha shot 433 tigers, 33 rhinoceros and 93 leopards. An insatiable big-game hunter, Juddha had a deep fondness for being in the wild and among wild animals, and from this came, according to oral history prevalent among members of Kathmandu’s Rana community including Juddha’s descendants, the desire to own a zoo.Built in 1752, Schönbrunn Zoo in Vienna, the world’s first modern zoo, was already over 100 years old when Juddha was born in 1875. London Zoo opened in 1828 and Alipore Zoological Garden (Kolkata Zoo) in 1875. Nawab Wajid Ali Shah Zoological Garden (Lucknow Zoo) was established in 1921. Juddha’s inspiration, his descendants say, was most likely reinforced by his tours to zoological gardens during his visits to England in 1908 and to different Indian cities.An article titled ‘Central zoo in state of neglect’ published in The Kathmandu Post in 1996 says that Juddha one day “received a pair of leopards as a gift”, cementing his desire to own a zoo. A report ‘Central Zoo Master Plan’ prepared by the KMTNC in 1996 says that Juddha decided to build a zoo in an epiphany when he saw that some animals “including deer, a few rhinos, and some tigers had been collected from the Tarai and kept in Kathmandu” could be put into one compound in the “lonely piece of land with a large 16th [sic] century Malla period Pokhari”.The pond lay still and serene surrounded by green wilderness ever since Patan’s King Siddhi Narsingh Malla built it in the 1600s. On the grounds surrounding this pond, the Newars from Na:Tole, Pulchowk and surroundings had their devisthans where, for centuries, they gathered to perform their religious ceremonies during Basanta Panchami and Bhoto Jatra even after this area fell within the Jawalakhel Durbar.For the palace, the ground served as its extended garden along with a horse and elephant stable. Subodh Rana, 69, grandson of Juddha Shumsher, recalled his father Kiran Shumsher telling him that Juddha and his family sometimes also used the scenic grounds for picnics. If there was any spot where Juddha wanted to build a menagerie, it would be around this Pokhari (pond). One day, he called his grandson General Maheshwar Shumsher Rana and deputed him to the task of doing just this.The zoo’s layout—except for the small plots of lands acquired later—that was in place when it came under KMTNC's management was, the present and retired zoo officials believe, mostly the same as it was built by Maheshwar and so offers a peek into how Juddha’s zoo must have been like. Pond in the middle of the ground surrounded by enclosures—the southern bank housing mainly larger animals, and cages for birds positioned on the northern banks.From pigeons to the king of the jungleWhat animals and birds did the enclosures at Juddha’s zoo house?“We cannot tell for sure,” Koirala says.Once it came under government ownership, the zoo was tossed from one institution to the other for lack of interest and knowledge on the right institution to manage it. Amid all this chaos, documents were possibly lost and the zoo has no concrete record about the animals that Juddha must have once taken amusement at, said Koirala.Mukti Narayan Shrestha, 82, a retired secretary of the Nepal government, joined the Central Zoo in 1970 as a veterinarian when many original structures of the zoo were still intact. Shrestha also worked with an elderly khardar who, he says, was employed in the zoo since the time of Juddha and was about to retire when he joined.“In those days where the purpose of menageries was exclusively for exhibition and pleasure with no regard for the welfare and recreation of animals and birds, the cages were tiny and iron-barred,” Shrestha says.Elephant, horses, deer, monkeys, tiger, rhinoceros, clouded leopard, red panda, bear, palm civet (nir biralo), four-horned antelope, Himalayan goral, pheasants, Himalayan monal—from the mythical and the majestic, the gentle and friendly to the fiery and ferocious, Juddha’s zoo boasted them all, Shrestha says.Shrestha’s account is not different from the anecdotes passed down to other retired and present zoo officials and the members of the Rana community, who also detail the rare and the exotic fauna, like the gharial crocodile and porcupine, even the jungle’s king—creatures, they say, that Juddha must have received from foreigners as gifts—appearing alongside domestic birds like pigeons.Tidbits of published information also confirm that the zoo had a good collection of exotic birds and animals from Nepal and abroad. One such suggestion comes from Kalyan Shumsher’s ‘Shree Teen Juddha Mahima’ published during Juddha’s reign in 1943.“One need not travel abroad to see the incredible birds and animals found in foreign countries,” he writes. “It will suffice to see [those creatures] right here in the zoo opened by His Holiness Shree 3 [Juddha] in Jawalakhel.”Among these incredible creatures, one reigned supreme—lion, the king of the jungle.For one, it would not have satiated Juddha to build a zoo and not have the jungle’s king exhibited in it. Juddha hence must have done everything possible to ensure one for the zoo. Infrastructure at the zoo suggests that the lion indeed lived at Juddha’s zoo or, in the least, during the Rana regime.“Where bear habitat lies today, there were two dome-shaped attached enclosures with a holding room, constructed in the classic architecture that many enclosures in the British zoos had in the past. They had brick walls and lime plaster,” Koirala says. “These were built to house a lion in one cage and a tiger in the other.”Near these enclosures stood another cage that remains intact today, with the head of a roaring lion carved out of the wall on the top of its iron bars. Zoo officials as well as members of the Rana community believe that Juddha had this exhibit built to specifically house a lion.Remarkably, these Juddha-era infrastructural spaces are corroborated by a rare piece of photographic evidence. A 1946 photo of the zoo shows a lion while a Kathmandu mother and her sons stand in front of its cage.Juddha’s place of piety and playThe zoo was not merely a space that Juddha sought out for amusement and retreat in the outpost of his palace; he also used this place to express his deepest affection.This affection spills right at the zoo’s entrance, in the form of the life-size statue of Karma Kumari Devi, wife of Juddha’s elder brother and Rana Prime Minister Dev Shumsher. Karma Kumari stands tall in her regal costume shaded by a wide canopy. Juddha revered Karma Kumari because it was she who raised him and looked after his mother Juhar Kumari Devi after the death of his father Dhir Shumsher. On another prominent part of the zoo on the south-east, Juhar Kumari’s enthroned statue overlooks the pond. Juddha had commissioned the London-based sculptor Domenico Antonio Tonelli to cast these statues.When Karma Kumari’s statue was unveiled is not clear, but Juhar Kumari’s statue was unveiled by Juddha amid a grand function in 1935 on Jawalakhel’s most auspicious day, Bhoto Jatra. It was attended by the British Resident Frederick Bailey.“On June 28, 1935, at Jawalakhel Durbar… the pond nearby looked very scenic,” says a Gorkhapatra news report titled ‘Statue installation’ dated July 5, 1935. “Because it was the day of Bhoto Jatra of Machhindranath… and moreover since an ideal woman’s statue was being unveiled, there was a crowd of lakhs of people.”Less than fifty metres from Karma Kumari’s statue stands a one-story building with a pagoda roof that today serves as the zoo’s meeting hall. Juddha, an avid gambler, found the scenic semi-wilderness covered in trees and filled with the sounds of wildlife to be a perfect place to relish the game. So he built a building with twelve doors on its four sides allowing him and his fellow gambling compatriots the freedom to enter through a particular door that they thought would bring luck. He called it his Juwa Ghar, the gambling house, and built it with the sole purpose of indulging in the game he loved. Roar of lion reverberates in KathmanduThe sounds of the animals and birds in the zoo rose up in the Jawalakhel sky. Every day, until much later in the 1970s, roar of the zoo’s lion (there were later other lions) diffused to far corners of the Valley, merging the zoo with the spirit of Kathmandu and informing the city folks of its presence.But was the zoo open to the public as well?“I think once it was built, the zoo was open for the public,” Subodh Rana said. “It is unlikely that Juddha Shumsher built such a large zoo and kept it only for his family.”For one, Kalyan Shumsher mentioning that one “need not travel abroad to see the incredible birds and animals found in foreign countries” suggests that the public had at least some access to the zoo. Of course, the Newar community from Na:Tole, Pulchowk and surrounding areas were permitted inside the zoo on the days of their guthi functions on Basanta Panchami and Bhoto Jatra.As the zoo was established at the back of the ground where Bhoto Jatra celebrations happen, it naturally filled with revellers on this day in addition to the guthi ritual observers as testified by the Gorkhapatra report. The photo of the mother and her sons also bear testimony that the zoo was not entirely closed to the public.What is widely believed, though, is that the zoo officially came under government ownership after Nepal became a democracy in 1951. And it would still be a few more years before it was open to the public in 1956.In 1945, Juddha gave up his power and eventually retired in Dehradun, India, where he died in 1952. With time, Jawalakhel Zoological Garden became the Central Zoo. It would take many avatars—a neglected site of crammed, unmaintained cages with sad eyes of emaciated creatures staring from behind the bars, a focal point of animal diplomacy, particularly during the period of monarchy, to, in its recent decades, a space of conservation and education.When all this was happening, the city sprawled around Jawalakhel, subduing the lion’s roar with its noise. More wildlife from around the country and the world came—creatures captured from the wild, those sold by circuses, those rescued from traffickers. Fate would bring these creatures to the care of generations of Kathmandu folks, intertwining each other’s joys and sorrows. After the tale of Juddha’s Jawalakhel Zoological Garden, there would be these stories to tell. Sitting around a table inside Juddha’s Juwa Ghar, Koirala and other zoo officials begin unfolding these stories before me. \nNepal’s book market is no stranger to the popular Bangladeshi-Swedish writer Taslima Nasrin. Almost all of her books have been translated into Nepali, but Nasrin herself says that they are all unauthorised translations. “All books [Nepali translations] are pirated versions,” Nasrin told the Post in a Whatsapp conversation. Nasrin, who is currently in exile in India after facing death threats in Bangladesh following the publication of her novel Lajja (Shame), said that she or her publishers have never allowed anyone the right to translate her books into Nepali. “I don’t know of any such Nepali publishers. No one asked for permission and no one has paid [me] royalty.”Translating and publishing books without permission from authors or publishers is a punishable crime. But Nepal’s book market is full of such unauthorised translations and prints of books written by the who’s who of the world literature. Such endeavours haven’t just hurt the authors but also the readers, says Ajit Baral, publisher of the Kathmandu-based Fineprint publication. “These translations are poor,” Baral says. “Tomes with 1200–1300 pages have been trimmed to 200–300 pages. An example is the biography of Bill Clinton.”Another popular book that has seen unauthorised Nepali translation is the biography of Steve Jobs by Walter Isaacson.“We have no official deal in place for a [Nepali] translation of Steve Jobs,” Peppa Mignone, associate agent of the CAA, the translation authority of the biography, said in an email interview with the Post.The book’s Nepali translation is published by Panchpokhari Publication House. The translated book identifies the translator thus: “Achyut Koirala, who has a master’s in English literature, is primarily a journalist. He is currently affiliated with Nagarik daily. He keeps a close tab on international history, politics and culture and has written scripts and dialogues for half a dozen Nepali films. He has published over a dozen non-fiction books.”Koirala, who admits to the unauthorised translation, claims that he hasn’t just translated the book but has also done ‘creative writing’ with it.‘Rich Dad Poor Dad’, written by Robert Kiyosaki and Sharon Lechter, is among the books that’s perennially on the bestseller list across the world. Upon investigation, the Post found three Nepali translations of the book—all unauthorised. One of them is translated by Dilip Kumar Shrestha and published by the same firm, the Panchpokhari Publication House. Another Nepali iteration of the book is published by Book For All publication and translated by Kopila MD. Yet another Nepali version is translated by one Sudheer Dixit and published by Plata Publication, Kathmandu.In an email conversation with the Post, Ronson Taylor, who oversees the international rights at The Rich Dad Company, said, “At this point in time, we do not have a relationship with an established publisher in the [Nepali] language market. If there are any Rich Dad Poor Dad books currently for sale in the Nepali market, they are pirated.”Basanta Thapa, a writer and translator, says that many books are being translated of late to make easy money. “But how would the quality of these unauthorised translations be!” Thapa wonders. “Readers who haven’t read the original wouldn’t know the faults in the translated versions.” Thapa says that any translator worth his salt aims to ‘recreate’ a book and it takes much work to do that.Taslima’s books are the major victimsTaslima’s memoir Uttal Hawa has been translated into Nepali as ‘Sangharsha’, literally Struggle, and is published by Khoji Publication House. Even though the book in its cover claims that it is an authorised translation from the English version Wild Wind, it is a pirated one. The book is translated by Bikash Basnet and edited by Bhogiraj Chamling. A revised version of the book is edited by Sangeet Srota (Yam Bahadur Chhetri).The same publication house has also published the Nepali translation of the book’s sequel as ‘Prem ra Jeevan’. Publisher Sushil Chalise says that while he is aware that one needs to receive permission from the author or the publisher to translate a book, his efforts to contact Taslima were unsuccessful. Therefore, he had published the version the translator made available to him. Translator Basnet, too, admits he translated the book without Taslima’s permission. “About a decade back, we didn’t know how to ask for permission,” he said.Nepal has the Copyright Act (2002) in place. Before it, there was the The Patent, Design and Trade Mark Act, 2022 (1965) that included intellectual property in its 2006 revision. Even the Muluki Ain (Civil Code) of 1910 BS had a provision about copyright. Moreover, it goes without saying that translating somebody else’s work without permission is immoral.Likewise, Indigo Ink Pvt Ltd has published a Nepali translation of Taslima’s anthology of essays No Country for Women as ‘Aaimai ko Kunai Desh Chhaina’. The book is translated by Krishna Giri and edited by Pramod Pradhan. “I have no idea about the agreement between the publisher and translator,” Pradhan, who is also a children’s book writer, says. “I just copy-edited it upon request.”Bishnukumar Poudel, publisher of Indigo Ink, however, claims that he is still trying to take translation rights for the book. “We translated the book long ago,” he says. “We are still trying to get translation rights.”Indigo is also publishing unauthorised translations under its imprints All Book Store Pvt Ltd, Book for All and Plata Publication. It has published two versions of Rich Dad Poor Dad under those shadow imprints. But Plata Publication is not registered in the Company Registrar’s Office.Pradhan says that many foreign books have had unauthorised translations in Nepali and their quality is poor. Those books are translated not from the original language but from a second or third language, so these translations are bound to have problems, he says. “After I learned that those were unauthorised translations, I have stopped editing them,” Pradhan said.Indian author Shiv Khera’s You Can Win has been translated into Nepali by Bloomsbury India and has granted the distribution rights to Ekta Books. But the book’s unauthorised translations are also found in the market and they don’t even mention the name of the publisher and translator. What is interesting is they mention that it’d be illegal to republish the book, or an excerpt of it, without the author’s permission.The Nepali translation of the book, which was poorly written and rife with inaccuracies, had landed the publisher at court. After a complaint was filed at the District Court Kathmandu in 2066BS on the charge that the publisher violated the copyrights and economic rights, the court had issued a verdict on Mangsir 11 that year, charging a fine of Rs10,000, Rs20,000 and Rs30,000 to the defendants Netra Prasad Pokharel, Narayan Prasad Bhusal, and Bhagwati Risal and Bishnu Silwal, respectively.Baral, the Fineprint publisher, says that international publishers wouldn’t demand much for translation rights given Nepal’s small market, but Nepali publishers do not bother to reach out to them. “Publishers who put out unauthorised translations and sell them at 50 percent discount have troubled publishers like us,” he said.Fineprint has published authorised translated versions of books such as Leaving Microsoft to Change the World by John Wood, Healed by Manisha Koirala, and Hippie by Paulo Coelho. The publication house is also set to release the Nepali translation of Israeli historian Yuval Noah Harari’s bestseller Sapiens. Translated into Nepali by Dinesh Kafle, the book’s translation right was acquired at the cost of USD1300, Baral said. Likewise, the publication acquired the translation rights of Sadhguru’s Inner Engineering at IRS93,000, he added.Baral says that publication of unauthorised translations is an immoral and illegal work. “This phenomenon not just hampers Nepal’s fledgling book publishing industry but also tarnishes the country’s reputation in the global market,” Baral said.Thapa, the writer and translator, points out the lack of regulatory mechanisms in the country. “We don’t have an agency that regulates the quality of translations being done,” he says. “Nobody compares the translation with the original. We need a dedicated authority to enhance the quality of translation.” Universities, Nepal Academy and other stakeholders can play a role to uplift the translation sector, he adds.One’s pain, another’s pleasureWhen the author Suketu Mehta was travelling through Mumbai, a young man approached him with a handful of books while his vehicle was stuck in traffic. Brandishing Maximum City, written by none other than Mehta himself, the young man requested the author to buy a copy. Suketu leafed through the book and said, “This is a pirated copy and I’m the author of this book.” The youth wasn’t bothered and replied, “Okay, you can buy it at a discount.”This anecdote was shared to the Post by Mehta’s friend, the author and professor Amitava Kumar, in an email exchange.Most of these pirated books are imported into Nepal from India while the retailers of original books are finding themselves increasingly in trouble. “We sell original copies but many readers doubt us as well, given the ubiquity of pirated versions,” says Anjan Shrestha, operator of Education Book House, Jamal.Ramchandra Timothy, chair of Thapathali-based Ekta Books Pvt Ltd, said that the phenomenon of piracy has tarnished Nepal’s image internationally. “There was a time when Bangladesh would be known as ‘piracy king’,” he said. “Now there's a risk Nepal would take the crown.”As tax increases, so does piracyThe government decision to impose a 10 percent tax on book imports in fiscal year 2019-20 led to a proliferation of pirated book markets, booksellers say. After the decision, booksellers started to cut back on imports and that led to the entry of a new crop of pirated booksellers, a trader in Kathmandu says. But following widespread backlash, then finance minister Bishnu Paudel struck down the policy.“After the government’s decision, we stopped importing books for a while,” says Shrestha of Education Books. “The import of books went down for about two years. Then the pirates stepped in to fill the gap. It was about that time that pirated copies of biographies and memoirs of Obamas and Jai Shettys became omnipresent in the market.”Pirated copies of classics by Roald Dahl and JK Rowling also made an entry in the Nepali market. Then the phenomenon only saw a rise.Since the customs department does not levy duty on foreign books and also does not care to differentiate between the pirated and original copies, unauthorised books have found a safe haven in Nepali market.The government doesn’t levy any customs duty on books and newspapers published by foreign publishers abroad. The importers should only pay Rs565 at the customs points. But Nepali publishers have to pay 10 percent tax to import books printed in India.James Taylor, director of Communications and Freedom to Publish of the International Publishers Association, says that the government, publishers, writers and readers should join hands to control widespread piracy. “The government should realise that book publishing and reading culture contribute to the country’s economy as well,” he said, adding that the government should seize pirated books and close websites that sell pirated ebooks.Nandan Jha, executive vice chair of Penguin Random House India’s sales, production and business department, says that piracy has emerged as a big challenge for publishers of late and has harmed the authors, publishers, distributors, printers, readers and other stakeholders. “To confront piracy, all the stakeholders should launch a special joint effort,” Jha told the Post in an email exchange.Piracy has proliferated in the Nepali market to such an extent that the publishers of such books and unauthorised translations keep whatever ISBN numbers they like, often conflicting with other books, and still get off scot free. If scanned or searched on the internet, the ISBN number gives details on the author of the book, what the book is about, and its price, among others.Bijay Sharma, information officer at TU Library, says, “Keeping ISBN number at one’s will is illegal. If anyone files a complaint, we can punish them.”By the lawThe Muluki Ain-1910 BS had mandated that a publisher take permission of Gorkha Bhasa Prakashini Samiti before publishing any material. The Copyrights Act came into effect in 2022 BS and was amended in 2054 BS. In 2059 BS, a new Act was promulgated and it is still effective now. Authorities are currently working to amend the Act to give the registrar’s office more autonomy regarding copyright.According to the 2059 BS Act, copyright violations are considered government cases. In such cases, plaintiffs should file a complaint with the police. The Act’s clause 25 has various conditions that amount to violation of copyright. The Act’s subclause A says that if a publisher produces or copies material in writing or sound and sells or distributes it, it amounts to violation of copyright.Likewise, the Act’s clause 26 prevents selling of unauthorised material. The clause restricts the ‘importation of copies of work or sound recording, either made in a foreign country or sourced otherwise, into Nepal for business purpose shall not be permitted if preparation of such copies would be considered illegal if they were prepared in Nepal.’If anyone infringes upon protected rights, they are liable to punishment but the provision’s implementation remains lax.The law gives the authority to district court to take legal action against copyright violators.Advocate Parshuram Koirala says that if the government becomes more proactive, it can punish violators on the basis of the 2059 BS Act and thereby control the phenomenon of intellectual theft and copyright violations. “Creation is a crucial part of humanity’s benefit,” he says. “If intellectual property is not protected effectively, then there’d be no inspiration to create something.”Bal Bahadur Mukhiya, a professor at Nepal Law Campus, suggests the inclusion of rules about digital piracy in law, and also the clauses of various related international treaties and agreements that Nepal is part of.“In the US, a teacher or professor should pay a certain revenue even to photocopy a chapter of some text for teaching purposes,” Mukhiya says. “But in Nepal, those who photocopy an entire book and sell it go scot free.”(This report is prepared in collaboration with the Centre for Investigative Journalism, Nepal.) \nIt has been such a long journey for Pushpa Kamal Dahal since he broke away from the Communist Party of Nepal (Unity Centre) to form the Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist) and waged a People's War in Nepal. The travails of the arduous trip from the remote villages of mid-mountains where the first guns against the government were fired on February 13, 1996, to an unceremonious ouster from what appears to have been his last stint as prime minister on July 12, 2024, seem to have taken a heavy toll on the Maoist supremo. Struggling to retain the leadership of a party that he steered away from armed insurgency to parliamentary politics, Dahal increasingly looks and sounds like a defeated captain of a dispirited team.In the mid-1990s, sabotaging the parliamentary system within five years of its restoration appeared foolhardy. But for impetuous and ambitious politicos, the pull of romanticism is invariably stronger than the restraint of rationality. Dahal displayed uncanny leadership in bringing Mohan Baidya out of his defeatism, convincing Baburam Bhattarai that his development theses needed the power of guns for their implementation and motivating Ram Bahadur Thapa to organise a fighting force of the deprived from almost nothing. The leftwing intelligentsia in Kathmandu was quick to manufacture apologia for the armed insurgency. The intellectual vigilantes of the Panchayat regime joined the communist chorus to discredit democracy. Naxalite remnants of the Jhapa Rebellion emerged from the Communist Party of Nepal (United Marxist-Leninist) ranks to act as overground mouthpieces of the underground insurgency. By the late 1990s, Dahal, under his nom de guerre Prachand, was a mythical hero with charismatic leadership qualities ascribed to his name. It didn’t help that parliamentary parties in the late 1990s had begun to disgrace themselves with unparliamentary activities.The post-facto legitimation of the armed insurgency almost fell into the lap of Maoists once King Gyanendra staged the “creeping coup” with the dissolution of the parliament and the dismissal of former prime minister Sher Bahadur Deuba between May and October 2002. After the autogolpe of February 1, 2005, it suddenly dawned upon parliamentary parties that tackling an autocratic monarch was more important than trembling in the imaginary fears of a Maoist takeover. Dahal lost no time in clutching the olive branch extended by the Seven Party Alliance (SPA), struggling for the reinstitution of parliament. The role of Indian interlocutors in formulating the 12-point Understanding is undeniable, but it was a win-win for both signatories: SPA conferred political legitimacy upon the Maoists and received the backing of an armed organisation controlling a significant territory in return.Peace processGirija Prasad Koirala had decided to call his deal with the outlawed Maoists merely an ‘understanding’ even though some of its provisions were revolutionary. The third point of the pact put the Maoist militia and the soldiers of the then Royal Army on the same footing and envisioned keeping them “under the United Nations or a reliable international supervision during the process of the election of constituent assembly”.The internationalisation of opposition to an autocratic monarchy inadvertently delegitimised the military. Once forced to choose between a discredited king on the one hand and popular acceptance with international approval on the other, the Royal Army took a while but decided to back the winning side during the April Uprising of 2006. The Comprehensive Peace Accord (CPA) 2006 was the formalisation of Maoists’ entry into competitive politics, and once they accepted to be admitted into the interim parliament in 2007, their revolutionary dreams were put into the cupboard where they were to shrivel and die in neglect.By January 15, 2011, when the United Nations Mission in Nepal (UNMIN) was driven out of Nepal without completing its task, the peace process had become proverbial “Birbal’s Khichdi” put up above the stove to prove the point that Maoists needed to irrevocably discard their agenda and ideology.The Constituent Assembly elected in 2008 had derived its claim to sovereignty from the success of the April Uprising, the CPA and the interim constitution. It was dissolved through a judicial coup. The legislative assembly formed through the elections conducted by an extra-constitutional arrangement possessed the legitimacy conferred upon it by the Supreme Court. However, only a sovereign, a popular movement, a revolution or a parliamentary decision has the mandate to confer sovereignty upon an elected, appointed or usurping body. The so-called second Constituent Assembly was legitimate but not sovereign. Maoists lost the game by being a willing participant in the political charade. The re-energised PEON graciously granted them the Enforced Disappearances Inquiry and the Truth and Reconciliation Commission on April 21, 2014, through an act of parliament to save face.Transitional JusticeThe Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) and the Commission of the Investigation on Enforced Disappeared Persons (CIEDP) were formed in 2015. However, the Supreme Court took the wind out of their sails by decreeing that several provisions of the very act under which they had been formed were unconstitutional and in conflict with international standards. In the absence of a legal framework, there was little that the statuary commissions could do to formalise the mechanism of transitional justice. They folded up once the Maoists were further marginalised through the first parliamentary elections in 2017 under the fast-tracked constitution.There are two ways for renegades to lose their class consciousness. The process of bourgeoisification, defined as the adoption of the characteristics of the bourgeoisie, first turns the leadership into an imitative aristocracy with tastes more expensive than the legitimate sources of income can sustain.Analogous to bourgeoisification, embourgeoisement turns the rank and file of a once-revolutionary organisation into meek conformists of social, cultural, economic and lifestyle values of the bourgeoisie. Dahal’s decision to merge his party into the CPN-UML on May 17, 2018, was as much an acceptance of ground realities as a desire to align with the Xi Jinping Thought. The Supreme Court dissolved the nascent Nepal Communist Party on March 8, 2021, and Dahal’s ambitions once again grew wings. By playing egoistic Deuba and calculative Khadga Prasad Sharma Oli against each other, he managed to lead the government for almost two years. The Transitional Justice Bill, recently passed by both houses of parliament, is the mechanism through which the dominant trio of Nepali politics wants to bury the past and move on.Terming it a flawed step forward, three international human rights organisations have welcomed the legislation with some reservations. The United Nations Human Rights Office has urged for its victim-centred implementation. But other than the NGO industry of Kathmandu and the limousine liberals of Lalitpur, there seems to be little interest among the larger public in the impending law.The processes of establishing truth, justice, reparation, memorialisation and guarantees of non-recurrence are essential elements of transitional justice. Its purpose, however, is to transform an unjust regime into a just one that ensures liberty, equality, fraternity, secularity and inclusive participation in governance for its citizens. It’s extremely unlikely that the present dispensation will do any such thing to loosen its ethnonational hegemony. With the help of Deuba and Sharma Oli, Dahal may succeed in burying dreams of a just regime, but peace of the cemeteries is inherently unstable.  \nSeventy-three years have passed since the 1951 revolution and the fall of the Rana autocracy. However, the economic prosperity that the movement imagined remains elusive. Countries with economies similar to ours in the 1950s forged ahead while we fell behind. Korea, Singapore and Taiwan are now on par with the so-called First World. While China has boosted its economy, and India is close behind, we are now the second poorest country in South Asia, just above Afghanistan. Why did we lag behind?The lack of educated, enlightened political leadership is at the core of the answer. Economic development in a knowledge economy requires the country's political leadership to acknowledge meritocracy, quality education and skills appropriate to the needs of the economy and pursue policies to enhance them. Education and skilled human resources are considered the prime movers of all successful economies. Take South Korea (called Korea hereafter) for example.KoreaIn South Korea, the leaders, including dictators like Syngman Rhee and Park Chung Hee (1948-79), were highly educated. They understood the importance of quality education and pursued policies to ensure it. Chung Hee brought the human resource concept into the policy. Korea's literacy rate increased by 2.6 percent annually from 1945 to 1968, reaching nearly 90 percent in 1968 and almost 100 percent in 2014. The GDP per capita grew from $94 in 1961 to nearly $3,200 in 2020. Korean secondary school students rank amongst the top in the Programme for International School Assessment (PISA), higher than the Western industrialised countries. Korean Government facilitates \"reading programs and movements, creating a desirable reading environment in homes, kindergartens, schools and communities, with particular help for those with special needs such as senior citizens, prisoners, the disabled, or families from other cultures, and finally, improvement in the infrastructure of libraries, as described above\", under their Reading Promotion Culture Act. With a population of about 52 million, according to Statista, in 2023, Korea had \"335 higher education institutions, comprising four-year universities and junior colleges with a two- or three-year curriculum\". Korea had the highest percentage of tertiary education graduates among the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development countries. Moreover, it has 583 vocational schools and considers libraries integral to a country's education and economic development like the developed world. As of 2020, it had 22,400 libraries managed under the \"Library Act\". The Presidential Committee on Library and Information Policy implements and controls library policies. Confucian ideas embedded in Southeast Asian culture emphasised meritocracy and education, enhancing education in Southeast Asian countries and China. Jawaharlal Nehru knew India could only compete in the knowledge economy with world-class educational institutions. He founded the Indian Institute of Technology and the Institute of Marketing and Management. The country is now one of the world's largest economies. Nepal’s scenario People with little or no formal education have led Nepal for several decades. The country does not have a culture of scholarship. Scrutiny at the cabinet-level appointments tells us that our political leaders do not acknowledge the value of scholarship, education, expertise and knowledge required to run a modern government and promote a knowledge economy. Politicians without subject knowledge occupy highly technical ministerial positions such as the Minister of Finance, Minister of Physical Development, etc. Since educational institutions are highly politicised, mediocracy prevails through the government. Political parties use teachers and students alike to promote their political agenda. Literacy enhancement and quality education have never been Nepali politicians' priorities. Nepal's literacy rate grew by about 1 percent from 1952 to 2022. It was 71.15 percent in 2022. Its GDP per capita increased from $51 in 1961 to $1,337 in 2022. The country has around 13 central universities and six academies of health sciences, and many other provincial universities are in the pipeline. However, most existing universities are poorly equipped, and Western universities do not recognise their degree. The schools face similar situations, as the standards are far from promising and have fallen even lower than during the Panchayat era. Over 52 percent of the students failed in a recent Secondary Education Examination. Nepal has no Library Act, and most Nepali schools lack libraries. A country of nearly 30 million people has no functioning national library. I have been involved in establishing libraries in rural Nepal through the Nepal Library Foundation for the past 19 years. When I expressed my frustration about the lack of cooperation from the government to a friend, he said, “How can you expect cooperation from a government whose leaders seldom read a book for pleasure or learning? A library does not mean anything to them. That is why we, a nation of nearly 30 million people, do not have a Library Act and one decent library. Do you remember the previous Oli government stopping the work on the design of the Nepal National Library in the Jamal area?”Why did we lag? Over the years, our political leaders have reached the pinnacle of power with little or no education and have refused to recognise the importance of meritocracy, quality education and human resource development. In addition, we suffer from a culture of mediocrity. Mediocrity is soul-destroying; it neither serves nor inspires. It breeds complacency. If we are to realise the dream of 1951, the mediocracy that dominates our governance must be replaced by meritocracy. We need educated, enlightened leaders who understand the 21st-century knowledge economy and do what it takes to prepare for it. Our political leadership should expand literacy, improve the quality of education, tie education with economic development strategy and immediately depoliticise education. \nWhile briefing about her official visit to India, from August 18 to 22, Foreign Minister Arzu Rana Deuba told the Nepali Congress (NC) central committee meeting on Friday that New Delhi’s response to Nepal's new coalition government was ‘positive’. This was a very cautious diplomatic statement. The term ‘positive’ in a diplomatic sense is unambiguously suboptimal in contrast to [being] ‘excited’ or ‘enthusiastic’. There is no hiding the fact that New Delhi was ‘okay’ with the replacement of the Moaist-CPN (UML) coalition by the NC-UML, but it has only sent lukewarm signals on the ascendance of KP Sharma Oli as prime minister, once again. Prime Minister Oli has made it a point to invite his Indian counterpart, Narendra Modi, through Foreign Minister Rana to visit Nepal; Oli has yet to receive a similar invitation despite newly appointed Indian foreign secretary Vikram Misri paying a two-day official visit to Nepal just two weeks ago. Many have viewed this as the lingering trust deficit between Oli and Modi.Be that as it may, New Delhi left no stone unturned to welcome Foreign Minister Rana and exude utmost warmth seldom seen during a foreign minister-level visit from Nepal. Rana had reportedly planned a private visit to Delhi for routine health check-up. On short notice, the South Block not only elevated it to a full-fledged official visit with an immediate invitation from her Indian counterpart, S Jaishankar, but also managed to schedule her appointment with Prime Minister Modi. Additionally, Modi accorded high importance to this meeting by involving key policymakers, including Foreign Minister Jaishankar, National Security Advisor Ajit Doval, Foreign Secretary Misri, Principal Secretary PK Mishra and Indian Ambassador to Nepal Naveen Srivastava.Shifting the neutral gearEqually rare in history, Indian and Nepali media alike positively portrayed Rana's India visit as a new stepping stone to pace the Nepal-India relations stuck in the neutral gear for at least a decade. Several serendipities worked: First, India needed a convincing diplomatic feat to reassure its neighbours that Modi's ‘neighbourhood first’, an overarching foreign policy instrument, has not faced a comprehensive debacle, even after the recent regime change in Bangladesh—India supported Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, who was compelled to resign and flee her country. Moreover, there has been a rise in anti-Indian politics in other neighbouring countries like Sri Lanka and Maldives.Second, Rana is not unfamiliar to Modi and Delhi’s power corridors. As the spouse of the five-time prime minister Sher Bahadur Deuba, she has had several opportunities for introduction and interaction with them. This certainly provides comfort in rolling the conversations, which are valuable in diplomatic dealings. It may seem trivial, but unlike many Nepali ministers, her English language skills and aristocratic sophistication come to her advantage in diplomacy.Third, the New Delhi establishment seemed unapologetically keen to recognise her as a (new) trusted friend in the Congress outfit and see her succeed in the first-ever ministerial responsibility. This has sent tremour waves to national politics back home. The coalition partner UML perhaps sees New Delhi's treatment of Rana as the manifestation of her special relations, something beyond what the government as a whole enjoys. Also, quite a few old-school compatriots in her party have now anxiously raised their eyebrows, assuming that India's trust may inch her forward in a bid to the party’s larger political role and government.Substantive issuesBeyond extensive paraphernalia, both sides claimed to have covered a broad range of issues of mutual interest, including the infrastructure and other projects related to cross-border railways, roads and bridges, Integrated Check Posts, petroleum pipelines and digital financial connectivity. Moreover, the increase in electricity export, reaching 1,000 megawatts, and the opportunities available in power sector cooperation after implementing the long-term power trade agreement were highlighted by both sides after her visit.However, a few contentious issues need deeper explorations than the tangential treatment they received in these bilateral talks. Straight air routes through Indian aerospace for the international flights operated to and from Nepal's newly constructed international airports in Bhairahawa and Pokhara, and clarity on the future of Gurkha recruitment in the Indian army are a few issues Nepal wants to see resolved soon. Operationalising electronic fund transfer gateways as the two prime ministers agreed a year ago and hassle-free processing to implement India-funded ‘small’ local development projects are on India's priority card.According to her post-visit briefing, Rana’s priority list included implementing the Pancheshwar Multipurpose Project and constructing a cross-border bridge over the Mahakali River connecting two countries. It was natural to show interest on her part, as the project agreement was signed 28 years ago when her husband became prime minister for the first time. The Mahakali border river, the location of the project site, runs along the political constituency of Deuba in Nepal’s far west. Furthermore, Rana made Kailali her political base in the same province.Regarding the Pancheshwar Project, India and Nepal’s priorities have diverged for a long time; the former preferred to optimise water use, and the latter focused on electricity production. Currently, as the power trade arrangements are gradually implemented, the interests seem to be converging. The peripheral issues of upper or lower riparian benefits, their components and pricing should no longer serve as constricting impediments. The enthusiasm rekindled in Kathmandu and Delhi to implement the project must not sublimate for decades, like in the past.Rana has had many firsts this time around. She became a minister for the first time, and it was her first official visit to any foreign nation as a minister. Besides, this is her first political and diplomatic responsibility, independent of nurturing her husband's political persona. Finally, her insight in navigating the complex geopolitical manoeuvres confronting Nepal will prove her mettle as a capable future leader of the country. And, her ability to manage the political waves that she created, possibly by winning the confidence of influential southern neighbours, may add at least some score to her future leadership bid in the Nepali Congress.  \nMosquitoes are climbing Nepal’s hills and mountains, marking their presence in areas that were not their traditional habitats. Accordingly, the number of people infected by the mosquito-borne dengue virus is soaring. A mosquito-borne vector infection, dengue is mostly found in tropical and sub-tropical climates and is concentrated in urban and semi-urban areas. According to the World Health Organization, about half of the world’s population is at risk of dengue, and around 100-400 million infections occur each year. Most districts of Nepal have seen a surge in dengue infections in the past couple of years, putting ill-equipped health centres, especially in the hills, which are new to dengue, under stress. Since January of this year alone, Nepal has seen over 5,000 cases and at least three deaths. In Sankhuwasabha, the district hospital is short of beds and healthcare workers. The situation there is so precarious that people have ended up on the floor, corridor, chairs, storeroom and hospital compound. This, however, is nothing new in the country—the Covid-19 pandemic exposed our inability to handle large-scale emergencies owing to a lack of infrastructure and preparedness. The fact that a disease like dengue has reached the mountains also confirms that we are amid a major climate crisis. With the rising temperatures, mosquitoes carrying dengue have gained climate adaptive potential and thrived in colder climates—or the previously colder areas that are slowly warming up. Even though other mountain districts like Humla and Mustang haven’t reported any cases this year yet, we cannot deny the possibility. Equally concerning is the lack of community-level cleanliness, sanitation and preventive measures. Government bodies often claim they are searching and destroying the mosquito breeding grounds, but the results do not corroborate their claims. One might wonder what the government is doing amid such a health crisis. The truth is that it is not taking this vector-borne disease seriously. Nor have there been satisfactory efforts to equip the healthcare centres struggling with less manpower, insufficient medicines and space shortages. With the changing nature of mosquitoes, it is also necessary to conduct comprehensive research to be alert in upcoming years. Notably, this year, hill districts have seen thousands of positive cases while Madhesh, the comparatively hotter region, province has reported only 77 cases. This discrepancy also should be taken into consideration.Experts worry that the escalation of risks in those areas that aren’t traditional dengue hotspots has turned things upside down. Our infrastructures have not seen any progress for so long, but things have changed, and endemics have started emerging in new areas. But we haven’t invested in strengthening healthcare infrastructures accordingly. The time has come to heed experts’ concerns and deal with this change by allocating more budget for the health sector and upgrading their patient-accommodating capacities. In the short run, the government should conduct search and destroy programmes, cleanliness and sanitation drives, and increase the supply of medicines and human resources in affected areas. If not, these seemingly trivial mosquitoes can pose more danger in the days to come. \nTikTok, a widely popular social media app, is set to come back to the Nepali market after the KP Sharma Oli-led government decided to lift a ban imposed by the previous government headed by Pushpa Kamal Dahal. The then government had raised moral concerns about the app, but now Oli wants to run it with considerable regulatory changes, which will take some time. Even though TikTok was often used to incite communal emotions and spread vulgarity, many took an outright ban as a violation of self-expression and free speech and cited that the app also had positive sides. Therefore, the incumbent government’s decision can be seen as a win-win situation in terms of freedom of expression and the need to demarcate the limits of freedom. For it to be able to resume its operations, TikTok is now mandated to fulfil certain conditions, such as promoting Nepal’s tourism, investing in digital literacy, uplifting Nepal’s public education system and keeping a watch on the content used on the site. According to data before the ban, the app housed around 2.2 million users nationwide, accounting for nearly 40 percent of bandwidth consumption. Having faced revenue loss for months, the social media site seems to have agreed to abide by the government’s directives about its fair use. Now that there will finally be a regulatory directive to handle TikTok, the government should focus on successfully implementing it. The world of social media is quite tricky, as anyone from anywhere can flout the rules and continue misusing them from the backstage. People kept running the app right under the government’s nose using virtual private networks (VPN). How the newly agreed-upon terms of engagement between the social media site and the Nepali government come into effect will be for us all to see in the near future.Being arguably the most misused social media app for causing social unrest, TikTok became the only site banned by the government. However, the concerns raised during its ban apply to other social media apps as well, not least Facebook, X and Instagram, with 10.58 million, 4.66 million and 3.60 million users, respectively. These apps continue to be sites of misogyny, racism, casteism and misinformation, among other concerns of discrimination and discord. But they have also offered many opportunities to voice their opinions and make themselves heard. They have provided youth with employment and entrepreneurship opportunities, not least in Nepal, where we have a vibrant community of social media influencers, celebrities and entrepreneurs. Banning TikTok, or any other medium of expression for that matter, is never a solution, and the current government seems to have realised it. But it should remain vigilant not to let any such social media site become a tool of misuse, exploitation and social discord. The general public should also be sensitised about how grave an impact their irrational behaviours can have in a country like ours which values mutual trust, cooperation as well as religious harmony. There is no other option but to follow the regulations. \nOur roads are becoming increasingly unsafe due to poor and haphazard construction, natural disasters. But more often than not, it is because our drivers are overworked, and there is hardly any solid monitoring mechanism in place to check their physical and mental status. Providing resting time for drivers becomes even more crucial during monsoons, when landslides obstruct roads and the journeys become longer.Realising the need to provide drivers with resting time and place, the Lumbini Province Government started building five “smart refresh centres” in Bardaghat in Nawalparasi West, Sainamaina in Rupandehi, Chandrauta in Kapilvastu, Lamahi in Dang, and Bardiya along the East-West Highway four years ago. These centres promise washrooms, eateries, restrooms, shower rooms, charging stations, parking area, among other amenities, to help drivers and passengers tackle fatigue during long-distance travels. However, due to budget constraints, the project hasn’t seen the light of day yet. While the idea of starting the refresh centres is laudable, there is a clear lack of coordination among political parties to complete the project. The ambitious project took shape in Lumbini during the CPN-UML government when it set aside around Rs110 million. But the government was ousted even as it began construction work, and the new government, led by the Maiosts, slashed the budget for the project. The project got shelved by subsequent governments. Even though the first phase of the project (only the construction of the building) has been completed in Sainamaina, its operation has been halted as it lacks proper guidelines for functioning. The experiment in Lumbini has been a failed project.Nepal’s Motor Vehicle and Transport Management Act mandates drivers to rest after six hours of driving. However, the authorities have failed to enforce the rules, let alone arrange proper rest areas for the drivers. Safer roads not only improve road safety but also help the country's tourism flourish. As we strive to expand our tourism agenda by attracting more tourists, the importance of ensuring basic resting facilities along the highways cannot be overstated. Providing the best services for tourists will attract them to the country, thereby boosting our economy and buttressing international reputation. While it is encouraging that several other provinces have rest centres along highways, the conditions are far from decent. Most of these centres lack basic sanitary and hygiene services. Moreover, such small projects lack sufficient construction as well as maintenance funds, as has been the case in Lumbini. The governments’ tendency to consider them “trivial” is equally concerning. Such a mindset not only hinders our journey towards making roads safer but also other opportunities that come along with it, including tourism promotion and passenger satisfaction. As highway accidents become a regular phenomenon in Nepal, we need more smart refresh centres. The federal government should therefore come on board and help provincial and local governments construct these centres through enough budget allocation on need basis. It is also necessary to devise a plan to maintain and renovate existing ones that lack enough amenities for drivers and passengers. Meanwhile, political parties should heed the projects that are in the best interests of people, and not weigh them on the basis of whether they fall under their party’s priority or not. \nLately, road accidents are taking place almost every day. Thousands of people lose their lives in road crashes every year across the country. What are the factors causing these disasters? Why have the authorities failed to prevent them? The Post's Thira Lal Bhusal sat down with former secretary Arjun Jung Thapa, who was director general at the Department of Roads for years, to discuss the pressing issue.Why are road accidents taking place so frequently in Nepal? There is no one reason for road accidents. On the infrastructure front, factors like design, condition and geometry of a road are crucial. Putting sign boards along the roads and giving vital information about the particular location is necessary. Those signs should be placed properly so all driving vehicles and passengers can see them clearly. Some technical aspects, such as whether the superelevation is properly designed, particularly at sharp bends, matter greatly. These must be regularly monitored and corrected in time. Regular vehicle fitness tests are essential. Experienced and disciplined drivers are equally important to ensure road safety. Some accidents occur when drivers are unfamiliar with the roads. For instance, the accident that took place at Anbukhaireni of Tanahun district on Friday, killing 27 Indian nationals, might have been because of the driver’s lack of familiarity with the road condition. Yet another serious concern is the lack of road discipline. Those who come to Nepal with years-long experience of driving abroad fear driving because of motorists' reckless driving and lack of lane discipline. The recent accident at Jadibuti, killing one scooter rider, could have been avoided if proper lane discipline had been followed. Reckless driving by motorcyclists has remained a big problem in our case. So, a separate lane should be designated for bikers. Similarly, lanes should be designated for vehicles based on their speed. But such rules are never followed seriously in our case. Traffic police have been entrusted with enforcing traffic rules but lack the human resources to enforce them effectively. We need an integrated and centrally controlled digital traffic light management system. We had experimented with a system as a trial for some time after 2015. We called a bid but couldn’t accept anyone as the bidders proposed more than the rate we had fixed. The project collapsed, and that system could never be revived. We badly lack technology in this sector. When we try to import technology, brokers get involved and ruin the entire process. The condition of roads built haphazardly, mainly in the hills, is another major concern. What do you say about that?We have built around 80,000 kilometres of road across the country. Of that, only around 14,000 kilometres fall under the jurisdiction of the road department. The rest of the road sections fall under the jurisdiction of various authorities, such as the Department of Local Infrastructure and provincial and local governments. The busiest roads are those under the Department of Roads. They are highways and regional roads. Only 50 percent of the roads overseen by the Department of Roads are blacktopped and are not maintained properly. Of the remaining 65,000 kilometres of road, only 4,000 kilometres are blacktopped. This means that the road condition across the country is poor and must be upgraded. The government will now develop the Kakarvitta-Gorusinghe section of the East-West Highway as a safe demonstration corridor. There will be proper infrastructure for crossings, grade-separated intersections, controlled entries, fencing for the safety from wild animals and crossings for wildlife. Local vehicles will run on service lanes. If it is developed as planned, it would be on par with Asian standards. Other roads in the pipeline will follow these standards. These criteria are being implemented while upgrading the Nagdhunga-Mugling road section as well. We have miles to go to upgrade our roads to international standards. Why are we failing to make quality roads?We can’t build our roads according to the original design. At times, locals obstruct road construction and force us to change the alignments. Then, we have to build them based on the availability of the land.Are our rural roads fit from the engineering perspective?Around 35,000 kilometers out of the 65,000 kilometers of roads that don’t fall under the jurisdiction of the Department of Roads are built randomly. Local leaders, influential individuals, and bulldozer operators fix the alignments of such roads.How can we rectify the malpractices in this sector?We need to activate the National Road Safety Council urgently. Officials from all the concerned departments and representatives from various stakeholders should sit together in this body and find solutions. Also, coordination has become more complicated in the federal system. For instance, highways are under federal jurisdiction, transport management on highways falls under provincial authority, while road management is under federal jurisdiction. Therefore, an effective coordinating body has become a must. Otherwise, we can’t control the increasing trend of deaths in road accidents. At least 1,700 people lost their lives in 2013, and the then government set a target to reduce it by at least 50 percent by 2020. Instead, the yearly death toll has crossed 2,800 now.While it takes years to complete road upgrading tasks, construction materials are left unmanaged and scattered, making driving along the road very difficult and dangerous. Can’t such things be improved?Contractors are powerful because of their political connection with influential leaders including prime ministers and ministers. Civil servants can’t be assertive when the contractors get political protection. At times, they try to use force to coerce government officials. If the situation is not going in their favour, they provoke locals with a plan to get extension in their contract citing local unrest. Experts say that the government is also to blame as it doesn’t carry out development projects properly. Do you agree?I worked for three decades in government agencies until a few months ago. What I found is that one government devises specific policies, plans and initiates certain projects but successive governments stop them. The new leadership starts its own plans and projects. Then, the contractors don’t get their payment. This is the other side of the story. Another problem is that our ministers, lawmakers and leaders show interest in the projects that deserve the least priority while important projects don’t get attention. For instance, around 30 kilometers of Arniko Highway, which connects Nepal with China, has been badly damaged. This is a very important road for the country. Can’t the government repair and maintain a 30-kilometer section of a highway? It requires just around Rs3 billion whereas leaders have allocated over Rs11.5 billion in the projects of personal interests of leaders. Around Rs4 billion has been allocated under lawmakers’ constituency development programmes and additional Rs5 billion has been earmarked for local bridges. We have allocated around Rs60 billion for non-important projects but we have ignored a crucial road, Arniko Highway, which was built with the support of our neighbour China in the 1960s. Thus we have given unnecessary importance where it doesn’t deserve while ignoring vital development projects. The road accidents are directly or indirectly linked to the government’s wrong policies and plans.Development projects are sometimes said to have failed due to rivalry between some leaders. Do you have any such experience?I will give you an example. In the Biratnagar-Bathnaha cross-border rail project, we had to build over 13 kilometers of the railway. It was around four to five years ago. We cleared over 11 kilometers but locals protested in the remaining section where a station was planned. The locals obstructed work there even as 85 percent of the money for land acquisition had already been distributed. Later, we found that the then minister Aman Lal Modi had provoked the locals to demand for additional money. He demanded a ‘special rate for his men’. But the laws don’t allow it.Some experts argue that to upgrade the quality of our roads, we need to make this sector competitive and, for that, we have to allow the private sector to develop projects. Is it viable?The government is hindering the private sector from entering into this business. They don’t invest without assured returns. They need roads like Kathmandu-Tarai Expressway. The government called for proposals in the build-operate-transfer (BOT) model for this project. They were interested. But the government simultaneously allowed a company to build the Kathmandu-Tunnel Road in the same area. Then the investors felt a risk to invest there. But, the company couldn’t continue the tunnel project. Private sector should be welcomed in this sector but we should create a conducive environment for that. Bangladesh and India have built infrastructure projects under the BOT model. We can do it as well.What do you think about the jurisdictional dispute over the New Road stretch between the Kathmandu Metropolis and the Department of Roads? Who should maintain this road?All the roads within the metropolis fall under the local government’s jurisdiction, as the constitution clearly states. The federal department is managing the roads with the understanding that the local governments are not efficient at maintaining them for now. If a local unit wants to maintain a certain road section on its own, the department should allow it without any dispute. Both sides showed childish behaviour while handling the New Road case. \nCPN (Unified Socialist) leader Ram Kumari Jhakri was among the most active leaders involved in the formation of the party after split with the CPN-UML in 2021. Three years on, she is now the most vocal leader calling for a unification of the two parties. Why didn’t the new party perform well, and what made her lobby for a party merger? Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal sat with former minister Jhakri for more insights.You worked actively to form the CPN (Unified Socialist), but the party couldn’t perform well. It couldn’t even become a national party from the general elections. What went wrong?We formed the CPN (Unified Socialist) out of compulsion. When Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli—who was prime minister at the time as well—dissolved the House of Representatives in December 2020, we firmly stood against his move, saying that it sowed the seeds of political instability. We staged huge protests and moved the Supreme Court against the decision of Oli, our party chair at the time. I was among the petitioners. Once the top court reinstated the House, we expected the party to move smoothly. Unfortunately, that couldn’t happen. The party establishment led by Oli and the rival faction took extreme actions against each other. The agitating faction announced action against the party chair, and the party establishment expelled us from the party itself. When Oli dissolved the House a second time, we protested the move as it brought instability. We were in favour of transforming the party through intra-party struggle, but the situation took some unexpected turns. We didn’t quit the party with a lofty plan of making a new revolutionary organisation. We were compelled to do so.Our new party accommodated many genuine leaders who had been sidelined in the UML. But ultimately, old leaders heavily dominated the new party’s central committee. They were active leaders of their time but were out of touch with the new, changing context. Young leaders didn’t get space in party committees. I proposed recruiting at least 40 percent members under 40 years in the central committee and over 50 percent members under 30 years in the district committees. I made a 29-year-old leader the chair of the district committee in my home district. In 42 days, I attended 36 district conventions where youths in their 30s were elected district committee chairs. I tried to reach out to municipalities to promote youths in the party chapters. But at the central level, old faces dominated party committees. That didn’t attract people to the party or impress the general public. Thus, it failed to gather steam right from the beginning.Many think that Madhav Kumar Nepal’s selection as party chief was a wrong move since he had led the UML for 15 years and become prime minister, and people didn’t find novelty in the new party. Do you think so too?Madhav Kumar Nepal has been the most active leader in the party since its inception. Whatever the party has achieved so far is because of him. But a party leader must mobilise teams with defined roles and responsibilities and continuously motivate and engage them in result-oriented tasks. He works a lot but doesn’t mobilise teams effectively. Observers say the Unified Socialist was formed due to the personality clash between top leaders and that it lacked a national agenda and a clear policy to prove the need for a new party. Do you feel so?Our immediate agenda was safeguarding the constitution and ensuring political stability in the country. We protested the House dissolution guided by the same policy. But when provincial governments were made like satellites of the federal government, we couldn’t play any role in stabilising them.The UML is guided by the policy of People’s Multiparty Democracy, propounded by the late Madan Bhandari. There was a debate on further enhancing the policy in the changed context. A large section of Left intellectuals were interested in contributing to that. We could have engaged them in the process. But our party stopped the debate on that topic as well. We missed the chance of engaging many critical individuals in the discourse and having a relatively different policy. When in the UML, we practised direct elections of party representatives and leaders from the conventions. Unfortunately, leaders of the new party, Unified Socialist, made a statute that gave powers to the party leadership to nominate party secretariat, office bearers and other members. Leaders would pick those who are loyal to them. This regressive approach killed competition in the party.You are known to prefer a more proactive work and decision-making approach. There are rumours that you have been fed up with the party’s lacklustre style and are mulling to join the mother party, UML.If I were to decide only from a personal perspective, I would have done so much earlier because I had multiple opportunities in the past. But I am for party merger because I don’t see any relevance of running multiple retail shops under communist banners because we are not substantially different from each other in terms of policies. Our electoral system has also made it necessary. The Unified Socialist can’t run like this. We must accept reality and decide—merging our party with the UML is better than running it this way. But it seems that the top leaders of the twin parties are still bitter about each other.True, the bitterness lingers on, mainly among the top leaders. We have also made some mistakes. The UML offered some opportunities to the Unified Socialist, and we should have made some offers to capitalise on the favourable situation. At one time, UML leaders proposed our party chair as a candidate for the vacant post of the country’s President. We should have devised our own proposal and made a win-win deal. But we ran away and squandered the opportunity. If Madhav Kumar Nepal had become president on the UML’s proposal, our party might have been reunited with the UML much earlier. I also took an initiative to that end but in vain. Later also, UML chair Oli visited our party chair’s residence to have our party on board the government. But the reaction from our side ruined things. We are certainly not responding to the UML responsibly. Rather than irritate the UML, we must turn each positive gesture into an opportunity for party unity.One more factor is blocking the unity between the two parties. There are a large number of second-rung leaders in the UML who can’t directly confront Oli. They are now encouraging former President Bidya Devi Bhandari to join active politics and trying to make decisions in their favour through her. Oli knows these leaders will support Nepal when he returns to the UML. Why would he [Oli] then merge the fringe party and create another power centre against himself? He knows Madhav Kumar Nepal will challenge him with the backing of the dissidents. It is natural for a leader to think twice before allowing another leader of your stature to create a parallel power centre within the organisation. Even I would have thought twice. This is a major factor hindering party unity.Your party chair and other key leaders seem quite close to CPN (Maoist Centre) chair Pushpa Kamal Dahal and critical of UML chair Oli. Moreover, Oli often lambasts Madhav Kumar Nepal publicly. Will they still merge the parties?In principle, our party is open for unity with any Left party. But party cadres won’t join the Maoist Centre. If our leadership decides to merge the party with the Maoists, a huge number of our party cadres will join the UML. Unity between the UML and the Unified Socialist is natural because we grew up in the same background and orientation. But we are quite different from Maoists. Several groups trying to form new political outfits have failed to emerge as a major political force and sustain themselves. You worked in a big party for years and also helped establish a new one. What are the challenges of forming a new political organisation in Nepal?Political parties sustain if they evolve with society. If you trace the history of the Nepal’s Congress and communist parties, you will see how they have evolved over the past seven decades. They competed against each other but joined hands to fight autocratic forces towards establishing democracy. They have done hundreds of progressive things in society. Their major fault is that they have multiple entry points but no exit policy. The only exit way is the death of the leaders. This has caused unhealthy practices and created dissident groups.The dissidents who didn’t get any space within their party formed new outfits. They also amplified negative narratives against the old parties. It happened with the Congress, the UML and the Maoist Centre. Had there been an exit system in the party, the situation wouldn’t be this bad. But new political parties can’t sustain without their own political ideology and orientation. You may form an organisation, cash in on people’s frustration and achieve some immediate gains, but outfits can’t sustain.But recent electoral trends show that Nepalis are seeking alternative forces and new faces. Can we be oblivious to that?You are right. We have seen such trends in the Panchayat system as well. But garnering votes during elections for one term and establishing a sustainable political force are two different things.  \nThe CPN (Maoist Centre) has either led or been a part of the government for most of the past decade and half. But the most recent Maoist Centre-led government under Pushpa Kamal Dahal was ousted only last month. Following this, the party’s senior leaders are in marathon meetings. The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal asked Giriraj Mani Pokharel, the Maoist Centre deputy general secretary, on the party’s review of the turn of events and its future strategy. The Maoist Centre is now out of the government. How does the party intend to go forward? We have started a series of party meetings to review the overall situation and to set the party’s agenda. We held a meeting of the office bearers that ran for five days. Now the party’s standing committee meeting is underway. After this, there will be a central committee meeting. That will take the final decisions on the party’s strategy and programmes for the coming days. In the meetings, the party chair has asked the leaders to discuss national as well as party issues frankly and honestly. At the end of the meeting, we will make an objective analysis of the overall situation and prepare an action plan.The Central Committee endorses the decisions. But the meetings of the office bearers and standing committee set the agenda and orientation for the party. What have you decided so far? On the national front, obviously, the dissolution of our government and formation of a new alliance is an issue. Leaders of the new coalition have said their alliance is for making changes in the constitution. They however are still not transparent. Based on their statements, it can be said that they are going against their own pledges. During the election campaign, they had said nothing about changing the constitution. You don’t find it in their manifestos as well. But in the middle of this five-year tenure, they have come up with a new agenda. A question arises: Can they change the constitution? Doesn’t that violate the mandate the parties got through the elections? Generally, the constitution might be reviewed after 10 years of its implementation. But we haven’t implemented it in a full-fledged way as we don’t even have all the laws required for its effective implementation. We have just agreed to conclude the remaining tasks of the peace process. So, the proposal to amend the constitution without first completing the basics required for its implementation is wrong. They want to make changes in the proportional inclusive system of our constitution. A political force can work to secure a majority in the House through general elections and ensure stability in the country. We accept that. We have also been lobbying for a directly elected executive president for political stability. They are not ready to debate on that. But they want to revoke the inclusive system, a major achievement of the 2006 people’s movement. This system has empowered historically excluded and deprived communities. We have to enhance the capacity of these groups instead of depriving them of their rights. If there are anomalies in the system’s implementation, let’s develop methods to more effectively pick our representatives. But the ruling parties seem intent on turning back the clock. Some leaders have publicly announced that they want to end the role of small parties. There can be a number of political parties in a country like Nepal, which is rich in social diversity. We adopted federalism for the same purpose. The leaders give priority to their family members and loyal ones while selecting election candidates and blame the constitution for the ensuing mistakes. They want to rule the country indefinitely through a two-party system. So we think the Congress-UML alliance is on the path of regression. Republicanism, federalism, secularism, inclusion and socialism-oriented systems are integrated five pillars of the present constitution. No attack on them will be tolerated. This is one focus of our ongoing meeting. We are also discussing some fresh international issues such as the developments in Bangladesh. We have yet to get a complete picture from there. But we can still learn some things. The centre of global affairs is changing and shifting to Asia. More importantly, there is a strong influence of such geopolitical forces in Nepal as well.Party chair Pushpa Kamal Dahal has said that there was an external hand in the recent change of coalition.External elements are active, in one way or the other. Some want to make our country a playground of external forces but our party and party chair firmly stood against it. The forces that wanted various things but didn’t get them from the government then started searching for a character suitable for them. People aren’t aware of such unseen elements but we should be careful. In the meeting, we are discussing this issue as well.Do you think geopolitics is the major reason for the ouster of the Dahal-led government?In his third term as a prime minister, Prachanda was working with certain priorities such as good governance, social justice and prosperity. He had taken governance seriously. Previously, there was a practice of exploiting state coffers in collusion between politicians, big businessmen and bureaucrats. The Prachanda-led government strongly stood against such a nexus. Actions against those involved in Bhutanese refugee scam, Lalita Niwas land grab, Bansbari Leather Shoe land scam, and gold smuggling are some examples. The government formulated a law to address the problems of loan shark victims. But some individuals associated with the coalition partners were involved in the scams. Were these bad elements linked to the Congress or the UML? Dahal entered into coalitions with both.The individuals were linked to partners in both the coalitions. The party chair made good governance his main priority but the Maoist Centre is the third-largest party so his hands were tied. When certain individuals were brought under investigation in corruption cases, the initiatives to change the government were expedited overnight. We can conclude that Prachanda government’s anti-corruption moves inspired other parties to oust it.You mentioned external interference as well as other parties’ fear of the government’s anti-corruption actions. Which one was the major reason for government change?The government’s anti-corruption drive is the main reason behind the formation of the new coalition. This drive brought the two largest parties together to form a government, which is unusual in the parliamentary system. The government is working to increase the threshold to secure seats under the proportional representation category. The proposed provision is against small parties, and the Maoist Centre has opposed this. Do you see the possibility of polarisation among the parties on this issue?When the ruling parties introduce new proposals that were not even discussed during the elections, we will definitely oppose them. We led the previous movements for people’s rights and we have to secure these rights. Thus the polarisation between those who want to trample on the statute and those who are against such attacks is inevitable. Is the Maoist Centre preparing to unify with other parties including the Nepal Communist Party led by Netra Bikram Chand Biplab?First, we are in the final stage of merging with the outfit of Mahindra Raya Yadav. Also, the Biplab-led party has endorsed the party unity proposal. We have to iron out some theoretical issues and make the party line clear in the changed national as well as international context. Dialogue between us is headed in the right direction.You earlier said party chair has urged other leaders to openly debate issues. Have they discussed why the Maoist party has lost its strength as well as the issue of the party chair holding leadership continuously for three and a half decades.Comrade Prachanda led the decade-long people’s war and subsequent political movements as well as the peace process, all of which made epochal changes in Nepal’s political history. No one can deny this. Therefore, Prachanda doesn’t need any position in the party. He is now a nationally as well as internationally established personality. But our party as well as the country needs him. Therefore, the discussions in the party are now aimed at making the best use of his personality in the larger interest of the society. As far as the reasons behind the setbacks we faced in the recent time are concerned, we had rightly assessed the situation in the past.But we couldn’t adapt to the changed context. We failed to develop our culture and lifestyle in line with our guiding ideology. Similarly, we failed to run the party in a proper way. We gave up our agendas and became power-centric. We developed anti-proletariat tendencies. We were gradually distanced from the public. Now we have decided that we must reestablish our relations with the working class and the oppressed. We have also failed to communicate about the important works we did when we were in the government. We need to tell the people what we did in their favour when we were in government in the past 15 years. There will also be some serious soul-searching.There is a perception that the Maoist Centre and its leaders are incapable of staying out of power.Our party’s general convention had decided to maintain a right balance in the party’s role in the government, Parliament and the street. It is true that we were in the past more engaged in the government. The party chair has already said that our focus won’t be the government from now on. \nAjaya Dixit’s current work focuses on studying challenges of building resilience across boundaries and at sub-national scales. He has studied and written extensively on water resources, trans-boundary water cooperation, flood management, wash services and climate change adaptation, clean energy transition and related policy studies. In this interview with the Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal, Dixit discusses river management in Nepal’s urban areas: Where have we gone wrong in this endeavour and what can we do? You have extensively studied river systems and have been following changes seen in river basins. How do you see recent problems caused by encroachment and rampant development activities?We humans have lived and have to continue to live within water cycles: water evaporates from the ocean to the sky and then precipitates to the land and flows via rivers back to the ocean. Rivers that function as arteries of the land surface, sustaining humans, aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems face widespread abuses: pollution, rampant extraction of their bed and banks, fragmentation and degradation. Without rivers, we would not be who we are. Unfortunately, we have forgotten this essence. We neglect and abuse rivers. In 1981, just after the monsoon ended, I, along with my students, walked from Sundarijal to Teku studying Bagmati rivers’ sediment. At many places, we walked on the riverbed. The river then was clean. Gradually, the river systems began to face all-round decay. I have read painful accounts of my contemporaries who remember swimming in the clean Bagmati and its tributaries. In less than 50 years, our rivers in Kathmandu Valley and other basins no longer look like rivers. I feel helpless and ache with pain at this collective failure! What state of rivers are we passing on to our next generation?River encroachment is common across Nepal but more serious in urban areas, including in Kathmandu. How can this be stopped?Our approach to rivers is an imitation of the trend common across South Asia, or the subcontinent, which is again largely based on the knowledge system developed in the industrialised Global North without contextualising locally. The region features waterscapes of high and punctuated rainfall during the monsoon months, rivers, wetlands, ponds, and springs, all connected with groundwater aquifers in one of the most complex landscapes of the world: the Himalaya-Ganga region. Yet, current development endeavours subjugate water rather than respect and live with it. In 2022, the Indus River in Pakistan faced major floods with devastating consequences. Referring to these floods, a group of global scientists stated that “the impacts [of the floods] were the outcome of an outdated river management system.” This approach is primarily based on building of physical structures such as buildings, bridges and roads close to rivers interfering with their natural flows. The approach that began in the early twentieth century keeps marching on even while we are facing twenty first century water challenges.There is an increasing trend of building corridor roads along the rivers in Kathmandu as well as other places. Is this a good or bad practice? In Nepal, road building in the hills has earned the sobriquet of “dozer roads,” meaning politically designed roads excavated by heavy machine operators without adhering to basic engineering, social, environmental, or hydrological safeguards. Even highways built with “engineering,” such as the Mugling-Narayanghat section, face regular accidents. The sliding of the two buses in the Trishuli is the recent example. Building roads along the banks of rivers, defined as “river corridors,” is the preferred approach for improving connectivity. In the Kathmandu Valley, this is also associated with rivers shackled within concrete walls in the name of river beautification. In the monsoon, however, they all overflow as we have been seeing in the last few years and this year as well.What will happen to these rivers 10-15 years down the line? Is there any chance of some of our rivers dying? Or, will the measures taken in recent times protect them?All rivers must flow clean and free in selected stretches. But today, rivers are disconnected with their floodplains. Within walls and embankments, they have become conduits of filth. Many rivers are already seriously degraded. If the current trend continues, many rivers may die. I remember Jacques-Yves Cousteau, the French oceanographer, filmmaker, and author, who wrote: “Water and air, the two essential fluids on which all life depends, have become global garbage cans.” Our current efforts at conserving, developing and managing rivers are grossly inadequate. During the Covid-19 pandemic, we saw some rivers heal as human actions across the board ceased due to the lockdown. But this healing came at huge human and economic costs. The lessons, however, are clear. We must stop turning rivers into garbage cans for them to begin to heal. The onus lies on us, our activities, our governance, and the policies we make and put into practice effectively. We need new ways of imagining rivers in harmony with human needs. Otherwise, the rivers will die. If rivers die, what will become of us?What problems may city dwellers face as a result of this continued destruction of rivers?A 2020 analysis of rivers in Nepal found that the quality of rivers in the mid-hills and the Tarai are already deteriorating. Industries, cities, towns, and agriculture produce waste that, when disposed of in rivers untreated, cause pollution. Solid and liquid wastes produced by expanding cities and towns pollute nearby rivers, streams, and water bodies. Pollution kills aquatic life such as fish, which are sources of livelihood for many communities. Polluted rivers and water bodies degrade human and environmental health, leading to negative impacts on human livelihoods. The impacts of pollution on rivers are considerable during non-monsoon months when river discharge, and consequently the capacity of rivers to dilute waste, are low.What should be done to conserve the rivers, at least in the present form, and stop further damages?All rivers are a combination of water (W), energy (E), biodiversity aquatic (B), and sediment (S), represented by the acronym WEBS. In the current scheme of things, the focus is on water and energy. Aquatic ecosystems are the concern of only those working on freshwater ecosystems. They are neglected in the larger context though the state has made some provisions for conserving ecosystems. In Nepal’s Hydropower Development Policy of 2001 all hydropower plants must release 10 percent minimum flow to the downstream reaches to enable fish and other aquatic life to survive in the river. A 2021 study of 50 hydropower plants however found that none of the plants surveyed release environmental-flows. All hydropower plants, as per their power purchasing agreements, are required to produce maximum power during the dry season. We should start by accepting the fact that rivers need clean flowing water and respecting the policies we have made. Then we must systematically introduce changes and avoid the oversights embedded in the present approach. The present approach to water development and management focused on engineering and structural solutions is based on single-disciplinary education that is blind to gender and social inclusion challenges and aquatic ecosystems. In the present approach, nobody seems to want sediment which is a natural consequence of flow within the water cycle.To meet such an objective, we need to begin with a system of integrated knowledge that synthesises natural science, social science, and indigenous practices. By incorporating fields such as hydrology, ecology, social science-supported context-specific engineering, and indigenous knowledge and practices, we can take a comprehensive approach to water management challenges and solutions. Interdisciplinary approaches can build collaboration, innovation, and systemic decision-making and promote innovative water management for the benefit of both ecosystems and human societies.Do you think initiatives such as river clean up campaigns run by various groups help protect these waterways?I see such initiatives as manifestation of dissatisfaction of concerned citizens with the degradation of rivers and to bring about changes. In 1990, I was part of the Save Bagmati Campaign, which aimed to highlight the degrading state of the river. This campaign has taken many new forms, and citizen groups have begun campaigns in other rivers of Nepal. They however remain fragmented and ad-hoc. Similar campaigns in some countries have led to granting rights to rivers. In 2017, New Zealand recognised the Whanganui River and its tributaries as legal entities, acknowledging their physical and spiritual significance as “living and indivisible” and ensuring their survival, health, and integrity to balance the needs of humans and nature. Promulgations like Living Indus (Pakistan), Namami Gange river-improvement programme (India) can offer lessons for a holistic water journey. The collective voice of concerned citizens for the integrity of rivers can be a powerful medium for policy and pathway changes. Nepal must also begin country-wide river restoration initiatives. We need more dialogue and conversation around water challenges and solutions.As cities turn into concrete jungles, their water tables are said to be receding alarmingly. You often propose redesigning our settlements and development infrastructure in a way that wouldn’t disturb rivers’ natural courses and catchment areas. Could you elaborate?South Asia is a region of waterscapes containing streams, ponds, wetlands, open spaces, floodplains, springs, and underground aquifers. Yet, our towns, cities, and infrastructure are planned, designed, and built to disregard water rather than live with it. As land-centric urban growth dominates, waterscapes temporarily seem to vanish but later water comes back. In Nepali we have a saying “In twelve years a stream returns”. The present practice of urban development is obsessed with concretisation, making these areas impermeable. Rainwater, part of which would naturally infiltrate the ground, now immediately reaches the rivers already constrained by walls. The river at a downstream section immediately peaks and when the rainfall stops the river has very low discharge. Basic parameters, like the intensity of rainfall (mm per hour), are poorly recognised and used in design guidelines. The interaction of current urbanisation practices and increasing extreme rainfall, temperature and humidity rise spawned by climate change and urban heat island effects will make our urban areas as crucible of hazards, and unhealthy. A new urban future must harmoniously integrate nature, including water bodies and wetlands, and preserve natural land cover, including traditional ponds to promote groundwater recharge. It can be further achieved by preserving green open spaces, forests, gardens, permeable “sponge” pavements, and natural waterfronts for healthier communities in sustainable cities. The starting point will be recognising cities as waterscapes. Amplified mitigation of emissions of greenhouse gases at global levels remains a critical imperative in this new future. The major impacts of climate change are evident through the water cycle. Squatters settled along the riverbanks are taken as one of the major headaches in preserving rivers’ catchment areas. How can this issue be resolved?The squatters and migrants to urban regions are outcomes of the present-day political economy of development. People move to cities seeking livelihood, education, and opportunities to move up the social ladder. These groups who end up living in high-risk areas are sometimes also seen as political vote banks. This issue needs to be viewed within the larger development question including generation of local employment, new livelihood opportunities and addressing insecurities of water, food, health, and education.Recently the Supreme Court asked authorities to make septic tank and soak pit mandatory while approving building designs in order to help recharge groundwater, and a recent Cabinet meeting has banned building any structure within 40 metres on both sides of major rivers in Kathmandu, Do such measures help keep the rivers alive or is that too little too late?Such decisions, in some way, seem to underscore the notion of giving space to rivers and maintaining their integrity. Building of septic tanks as part and parcel of new houses began in the 1970s as primary treatment units that can prevent the direct dumping of human waste into rivers and water bodies. The regular cleaning and safe disposal of waste from septic tanks are emerging questions. Rivers and waterscapes face much deeper challenges, however. The present water development model marches on like a mighty tusker, trampling in its path communities, villagers, residents, natural ecosystems, the terrestrial and aquatic beings, and past memories. Turning that around will require those working on water and river integrity across geographical, social, disciplinary and political boundaries to join hands in seeking changes and laying the foundation for a new ethical social contract for rivers and waterscapes as a first step in that long journey. \nWithin days of CPN-UML chair KP Sharma Oli and Nepali Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba reaching a deal to form a new government under Oli’s leadership, some Congress leaders including the two party general secretaries started doubting the deal’s implementation. Independent observers also have doubts over the longevity of the Congress-UML partnership. To get some insight, the Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal sat down with Congress Central Committee member Govind Raj Pokharel, who is also former vice-chair of National Planning Commission. Many have expressed doubt over the longevity of the Congress-UML alliance. What is your observation?There was a discussion in the political circles on the need for the Congress and the UML joining hands to address some serious problems the country has been facing for years. The issues of governance, flaws seen in the practice of the electoral system, and the national economy are some pressing issues that need to be addressed. In the meantime, the top leaders of the two largest parties reached a deal overnight. The dramatic turn of events made people suspect some unspoken reasons had brought the leaders of the two rival forces together. The leaders have stated that they joined hands mainly to review the constitution, to make changes in the electoral system, improve governance and address problems seen in the economic sector. These are the stated objectives. As far as my observation goes, people don’t have full faith in the leaders of the two parties because of past records. On the economic front, this coalition may achieve some improvements because both parties are on the same page. Both follow liberal economic ideas. Of late, even the UML has become increasingly liberal on economic issues. The private sector has welcomed the new alliance. There are already some signs of reforms. Their plan to make changes in the electoral system through constitutional amendment however is not easy. First, their numerical strength in the federal parliament, mainly in the upper house, is insufficient to amend the constitution. Such a move would be risky from a strategic perspective as well. Many groups and forces have reservations over various provisions of this constitution. Once they start the amendment process, it will be like opening Pandora’s Box. Thus I am optimistic only on the economic front. If they get that right, it will help address the society’s mass frustration.The two parties have cited the perennial political instability as a major reason behind their coming together. Can we now expect policy consistency as well?Political instability is an excuse to cover up their failures. Even the alliance of largest parties cannot guarantee political or policy stability. Numbers alone are not enough. Leaders also need to have a democratic culture and the capacity to manage emerging issues. Even governments led by a single party commanding up to two-thirds majority have failed. On certain occasions, coalition governments have done commendable jobs. Handling the post-quake situation and producing the constitution in 2015 were examples of big parties justifying their coalition. Thus even with some doubt, we can expect political stability and some economic reforms.The Congress unanimously endorsed the deal of party president Sher Bahadur Deuba and CPN-UML chair KP Sharma Oli. But in public, leaders from the anti-establishment faction of the Congress don’t seem satisfied. Why this unease?The deal was made in a dramatic way without proper consultations with other leaders. At least those in the executive committees of the party should have been consulted. It is challenging for the Congress leaders to ally with their major rival, the UML. A cadre-based party, the UML’s style of governance is different to that of the Congress. When in government, the UML treats even government institutions, constitutional bodies and independent agencies as the party’s structures. Whereas the Congress allows more freedom to government agencies. So, there is a risk of the UML misusing state mechanisms while the Congress leaders are in the Cabinet. This is one big risk for the Congress. The second concern is the working style of Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli. He is a towering personality, a hard-working leader, and with his strong command over his party organisation, he can swiftly implement any proposal. The Congress ministers who also have to listen to the concerns of the party’s top leaders may struggle to strike a balance. In Oli’s Cabinet, ministers are likely to get less freedom within their ministries. A rift is thus likely because of Prime Minister Oli’s working style.Why didn’t the Congress then send influential leaders to the Cabinet to check the prime minister?The leaders might not have been so interested in joining this government. They might have sensed intervention from the prime minister’s office and thought they might not be able to perform as per their expectation under Oli’s leadership. See, chiefs of the Congress, the UML and the Maoist Centre work in a dictatorial way. Once they are elected at the party convention for four years, they behave like dictators. They take decisions on their own without any consultations. People in Nepal often lobby for a directly-elected prime minister or President. I wonder what these leaders would do if they were directly elected as executive head. So, the problem is in the working style and attitude of our leaders, not in the constitution or the electoral system.Shekhar Koirala and Gagan Thapa had first pitched for joining hands with the UML to end ‘unnecessary bargaining’ of fringe parties. Suddenly, Deuba struck the deal with Oli. And, now Koirala and Thapa seem sceptical about the deal.The proposal of Koirala and Thapa was for Congress leading the government and the UML supporting it. In fact, Oli was ready to accept Congress leadership. He requested the Congress leaders to take the lead. Surprisingly, the negotiating team led by our party president reached an opposite deal. They offered government leadership to Oli.Then, could it be that, as some claim, Deuba and his wife Arzu were desperate to unseat Dahal fearing they could be dragged into corruption scams?I don’t know much about that scenario. But what I knew is that Oli was willing to join a Congress-led government.Why would Deuba, who is a very clever leader in making such give-and-take deals, have given up a chance to be prime minister right away?It’s true that all three party chiefs—Deuba, Oli and Dahal—are very clever in making deals in their own favour based on their numerical strength. A leader beats the other two on one occasion and on another, another of them comes out on top. It’s like a see-saw. This time Oli won the game.Congress General Secretaries Gagan Thapa and Bishwa Prakash Sharma have expressed suspicion over the implementation of the deal. Many say they did so as Deuba didn’t involve them in negotiations on power-sharing. Is it true?The party’s central work execution committee endorsed the deal signed by the two leaders. The leaders who participate in such meetings should speak up then and there if there is anything objectionable, instead of making such statements in public. Why didn’t they oppose it at the meeting? I don’t see any point in expressing doubt over the deal in public while endorsing the same in party committees.The two general secretaries also expressed doubt over Oli handing over government leadership to Deuba as per the agreement. Why this mistrust?The experience of the past two or three decades makes politicians suspicious of each other. Nepali politicians have hardly ever handed over government leadership easily. After four or five months of collaboration, some issues emerge and a rift is created. So, history makes us doubt that this coalition will last for three and half years. In the meantime, the party establishments have sidelined other factions when it comes to picking ministers, both at federal and provincial levels. When the government fails to perform as per expectation, party cadres of the ruling parties start criticising the government. Is it possible to amend the constitution as the two parties have announced?We can’t backtrack on the inclusive system. We must abide by the policy of inclusion in state agencies. The leaders who spoiled this system are saying that the proportional representation (PR) system is not working. But there is room to make our three-tier federal system more cost-effective. People get irritated when they see a large number of representatives benefitting from state coffers. We can bring down the number of local units from 753 to around 400. However, there should be sufficient wards as those units are directly involved in service delivery while the Palikas are more engaged in development activities. The number of ward members can also be decreased. In provinces, we don’t need PR seats as those elected from the provincial constituencies automatically represent the local communities. Likewise, the provincial cabinets can be downsized. Thus we can downsize the number of people who benefit from state coffers. This is vital to make the federal system sustainable. Similarly, we can rightsize the number of PR seats by adopting a rotational constituency for women, dalits and other marginalised communities. Only the candidates from underrepresented sections will compete in those constituencies. This will help elect competent people even from within the targeted communities. This is how we can address some concerns without compromising the inclusive system envisioned in the constitution.Why has the Congress picked gangsters and tainted individuals as ministers in provinces?The selection of such controversial individuals as ministers and policy makers will damage the party’s image. People are going to raise this issue seriously. In fact the pace of criminalisation and commercialisation of Nepali politics is faster than the political reform being undertaken to clean up politics.It seems intellectual leaders are being sidelined while gangsters are being promoted. Why is it happening?Because people from intellectual or political backgrounds voice critical views and leaders don’t like it. They speak what their conscience says is right. For instance, leaders like Mahesh Acharya and Minendra Rijal aren’t given any role in the party. It is a common problem in all the major political forces in Nepal.Is the space for leaders with intellectual backgrounds and having critical views being squeezed?The Congress used to be a very liberal organisation. But it has also become illiberal and leaders have become increasingly intolerant. All leaders—whether the seniors or young ones—are becoming less tolerant even of constructive criticism. Party leaders haven’t spoken against the selection of gangsters as ministers. Even the office bearers who are in decision making bodies and can change the decisions are silent now. This is dangerous. This is an example of how critical voices are sidelined.Haven’t the two young general secretaries been able to raise hope in the Congress?They are working like central committee members. General secretaries should be able to intervene while making crucial policy decisions. They can stop the party committees from making wrong decisions. But they are risk-averse. They are not taking the risk to fight the powerful party establishment.Historically, in all parties there is a trend of its anti-establishment faction bargaining for 40-45 percent seats in the party or government. If they don’t get an acceptable power sharing deal, they don’t cooperate with the party leadership. Is it a healthy democratic practice?Intra-party competition compels the leaders to do this. The ruthless establishment always sidelines party members and leaders if they aren’t loyal. So, the leadership of the anti-establishment has to protect such cadres because the rival factor too needs a strong support base of cadres to compete against the powerful establishment. Party establishments are strong due to centralised resources and other factors, so you need an equally strong force to compete against them. \nThe Meteorological Forecasting Division has predicted partly to generally cloudy conditions across the country on Thursday.Light to moderate rain, accompanied by thunder and lightning, is likely in several areas, with a possibility of heavy rainfall in one or two locations within Koshi, Gandaki, Lumbini, and Karnali provinces.Tonight, the hilly regions are expected to remain partly to generally cloudy, while the rest of the country will experience partly cloudy to mainly fair conditions.

Though still a developing nation, Nepal was a land of profound beauty and deep-rooted cultural heritage. The residents of Nepal faced many challenges, but beneath these hardships lay a resilient spirit and an unyielding hope for the future.\n\nThis enchanting land, where Mount Everest reaches towards the skies and the air carries a mix of incense and cool mountain breezes, was more than a geographical marvel. It was a mosaic of cultures, languages, and traditions, a testament to human endeavor against all odds. Nepal's history, from the unification under King Prithvi Narayan Shah to its transformation into a federal democratic republic, told a story of aspiration and endurance.\n\nIn recent years, the people of Nepal, with their indomitable will, had taken strides towards rebuilding and reimagining their country. They turned their struggles into stepping stones, each challenge a chapter in their ongoing saga. The shift from a monarchy to a republic had not only changed governance but had woven a new tapestry of democratic values and collective decision-making.\n\nEconomically, while agriculture continued to sustain a large part of its population, Nepal had begun to harness the potential of its picturesque landscapes, developing sustainable tourism that promised to preserve their natural heritage while boosting local economies. Communities living in the shadows of the Himalayas had become stewards of the earth, protecting the biodiversity that made their country unique.\n\nEach day brought new stories. Whether it was a festival in Kathmandu, a technological advance in Pokhara, or a conservation effort in Chitwan, these events were threads in the vibrant quilt of Nepali life. These stories, updated daily, reflected the pulse of progress and the spirit of hope that characterized this resilient nation.\n\nAnd so, as Nepal moved forward, each moment was not just a passage of time but a promise of potential, a narrative of a nation perennially climbing towards tomorrow, guided by the legacy of its past and the dreams of its future.\n\nNews events:\nNepal and China have agreed to issue five-year entry and exit passes for people in 15 districts of northern Nepal abutting China. After incorporating Chinese feedback, the Department of Immigration, under the the Ministry of Home Affairs, has recently redesigned the entry/exit pass and come with an operating procedure, which was first approved on June 19 by the ministry. The new arrangement, which is in line with the bilateral agreement and immigration regulations, will allow Nepali citizens living near the Chinese border to enter and exit from China’s Autonomous Region, Tibet, states one of the objectives of the operating procedure issued by the government.Nepali citizens living in northern districts who depend on Tibet for trade, pilgrimage, work, health checks and other daily activities, have long been complaining of hassles in visiting Tibet due to lack of mandatory passes.However, this arrangement was suspended after the onset of Covid pandemic at the end of 2019. And after China started reopening 14 traditional entry points, some local units on the Nepali side started issuing temporary “China Departure and Entry Permits” locally. Now, to streamline the entry and exit permission, the Department of Immigration is all set to issue digital passes to residents of the 15 districts. However, Nepali citizens from other districts will need a visa to enter Chinese territory.According to the operating procedure, the 15 districts where the passes would be distributed are Taplejung, Sankhuwasabha, Solukumbhu, Dolakha, Sindhupalchok, Rasuwa, Dhading, Gorkha, Manang, Mustang, Dolpa, Mugu, Humla, Bajhang and Darchula.Those 14 dedicated trading/entry/exit points between Nepal and China are Tiptala (Taplejung); Kimathnaka (Sankhuwasabha); Falak and Lapchi of Dolakha; Tatopani and Gumba of Sindhupalchok; Lazing and Chhekampar (Gorkha); Korala of Mustang; Hilsa (Humla); Nakcha (Mugu); Maringla Bhanjyang (Dolpa); Urai (Bajhang); and Tinkar of Darchula district. According to the Department of Immigration, the entry pass will, however, not be issued immediately in Solukumbhu, Dhading, and Manang districts due to ongoing adverse weather conditions. “A decision has already been made to issue digital passes. It is in the implementation process,” said Koshahari Niraula, Director General at the Department of Immigration. “Necessary instructions have been given to the immigration and district administration offices for implementation.”Before 2007, Nepali and Chinese nationals from border districts could travel up to 30 kilometres inside each other’s territory without restrictions. However, in January 2007, both sides reached a new agreement under which an identity card with one year validity was made mandatory, said noted cartographer Buddhi Narayan Shrestha. Now, both sides have developed a digital identity card. Nepal and China first entered an ‘Agreement on Trade and other Related Matters between the Tibetan Autonomous Region (TAR) of China and Nepal’ on September 30, 1956, which was last renewed on July 10, 2002. The agreement says those wishing to travel to the other country must hold valid passports issued by the sending country and a visa issued by the receiving country. Inhabitants of the border districts shall hold exit-entry passes with photo-affixed ID cards for border trade, pilgrimage and to visit relatives and friends, according to the agreement.Shrestha said those with the entry/exit passes are not allowed to travel beyond the border districts into the interior of the other country.“Generally, the limit is 30 km from the borderline. And those with permits for pilgrimage can travel through the designated routes and allotted entry points. They are not permitted to stay in the border districts of the receiving country for more than a month. Either party has the right to refuse entry into its territory of anyone deemed persona non-grata,” according to Shrestha.A senior foreign ministry official confided to the Post that the Chinese side initially expressed some reservations about the proposed operating procedure, particularly the issuance of five-year passes to Nepali citizens in the 15 northern districts. They had also called for making the passes digital.After considering the Chinese request, the foreign ministry official said that the home ministry had redesigned the new pass, revisiting some conditions that were initially proposed.Niraula said the Chinese side has agreed to issue the pass for five years. “With their consent, we have finalised and issued the new operating procedure.”According to one Home Ministry official, the ministry and the Department of Immigration agreed to incorporate biometric security features into the pass, as requested by Chinese officials. The new pass with biometric information is intended to curb illegal and criminal activities across the Nepal-Tibet border. The five-year pass will be issued exclusively to Nepali citizens living in the 15 border districts, their siblings, and those who are married and living permanently in these districts.Also, those who have migrated from other districts and are now permanently living in these 15 districts are eligible for the pass.However, if someone gets married and migrates to another district, they will not get the pass.To obtain the entry pass, one should fill out a form and provide required documents including a copy of the citizenship, a recommendation letter from the ward office, a migration letter if the service seeker has migrated from another district, a marriage certificate (for those coming from another district after marriage) and a passport-sized photo, according to the operating procedure.After verifying all the documents and information, the immigration office issues the permit, said the work plan. In case a district does not have immigration office, the service seekers should visit the district administration offices to receive the pass.“The permit is not transferable and will remain valid for up to five years from the date of issuance. Once it expires, one should reapply. If the card is lost or destroyed, the same process should be followed to get a copy of the permit,” according to the operating procedure.Madav Sapkota, a CPN (Maoist Centre) lawmaker from Sindhupalchok district, lauded the development and said it will benefit the people living in bordering districts.“The process was started when Pushpa Kamal Dahal was the prime minister, and now it is set to be formalised. Earlier, the Chinese authorities would issue one-year entry permits, and after Covid, they limited it to a day-long pass. If the entry process is simplified further, it will benefit the citizens from both sides even more,” said Sapkota. \nMinister for Education, Science and Technology Bidya Bhattarai is continuing her predecessor’s efforts to curb politicisation in the education sector.During an interaction with journalists on Wednesday, the minister said she has started consultations with top leaders from various parties for their commitment to prevent political interference in schools and universities. Bhattarai stated that partisan interference is a major factor responsible for the degradation of the entire academic sector, and that she is actively working to stop the malpractice.“I had invited the general secretaries from different parties to discuss the matter. Except for the Nepali Congress, whose general secretaries did not attend citing busy schedules, I did have discussions with those from the CPN-UML and the Rastriya Swatantra Party,” she said. “Although we could not reach any conclusion, discussions have at least begun. Politicisation will not stop without strong political commitment against it.” She also informed that she was working on an education reform plan by incorporating inputs from political parties. Bhattarai, a UML leader, became the education minister in the Oli Cabinet on July 15.Her predecessor Sumana Shrestha had started efforts to reduce politicisation in the academic sector, particularly teachers and professors involved in party politics. Her actions, however, were criticised by the top leaders of all major parties—the Nepali Congress, the UML and the CPN (Maoist Centre). Soon after assuming office, Shrestha had sought information from the Election Commission and district education units on teachers and professors affiliated to political parties.The initiative was taken as per the Political Parties Act, 2017, which prohibits teachers, professors and government employees from engaging in politics. Similarly, the Patan High Court on October 5, 2021 had ruled that schoolteachers cannot engage in active politics. Responding to a writ petition, the court said those drawing salaries and benefits from state coffers should not be involved in partisan politics.As per her claim, a total of 825 teachers across the country voluntarily resigned their political party memberships during her tenure as the minister. She had also claimed that 20 teachers associated with political parties resigned after the ministry started taking actions against the party-affiliated teachers.Politicisation in the academic sector has been further fuelled by partisan influence in school and university appointments, as well as sharing of crucial university positions among political parties.Only last week, Bhattarai had publicly requested Minister for Home Affairs Ramesh Lekhak to ensure security at the Tribhuvan University amid a dispute over an appointment.The dispute emerged when Kusum Shakya, Dean of the Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences, nominated Tikaram Gautam for appointment as head of the Department of Sociology although Pasang Sherpa was senior than Gautam.As per the university records though both Sherpa and Gautam are associate professors, Sherpa had joined the university four years earlier. Nepali Congress students at the university, however, wanted Gautam to be the department head. A leader of the Nepal Students’ Union, the sister wing of the Congress party, had threatened physical action against the university’s vice-chancellor, rector and registrar if Sherpa was appointed over Gautam.The university authority, following the threats, refrained from going to their offices and wrote to the education minister asking for security. Minister Bhattarai, subsequently, made a public request to the home minister for security arrangements.  \nNepal and the United Kingdom have signed two separate memorandums of understanding (MoUs) related to approximately Rs6.5 billion in grant support.According to the Ministry of Finance, the first MoU pertains to the Resilience, Adaptation, and Inclusion in Nepal (RAIN) programme, with funding of £38.5 million (approximately Rs6.5 billion), while the second concerns the Samartha programme—Enhancing Gender & Human Development Outcomes Through Systems Strengthening—with £38.8 million in support (approximately Rs6.58 billion).“These programmes are aimed at strengthening the capacities of local governments and communities most affected by climate change, as well as building human capital and improving the delivery of basic services in Karnali, Lumbini, and Madhesh provinces,” the press release issued by the Ministry of Finance stated.The agreement was signed by Dhani Ram Sharma, joint secretary at the finance ministry, and Pippa Bird, development director and deputy ambassador at British Embassy in Kathmandu, at a programme organised in Kathmandu on Wednesday.The RAIN programme is a six-year initiative to be implemented by the Ministry of Home Affairs (MoHA) and the Ministry of Forest and Environment (MoFE) to strengthen disaster risk management and climate change adaptation. It will be implemented in Karnali, Lumbini, and Madhesh provinces.Similarly, Samartha is a seven-year programme designed to enhance the systems and capacities of provincial and local governments to expand access to and deliver quality social services, with a particular focus on the education and health sectors. It will be implemented by the Ministry of Education, Science and Technology (MoEST) and the Ministry of Health and Population (MoHP), the release stated. Samartha will operate in the Lumbini and Madhesh provinces.Speaking at the signing ceremony, Sharma said that the programmes will be crucial in advancing Nepal’s socio-economic landscape, with a particular focus on sustainable development goals (SDGs).“This cooperation will be crucial in advancing Nepal’s socio-economic landscape, with a particular focus on SDGs and the objectives outlined in the 16th Periodic Plan, including social services, climate resilience, and human capital development,” he said.Likewise, Bird affirmed the UK’s continued support for Nepal. “These programmes will build resilience to natural disasters and climate change and improve the delivery of basic services to the most vulnerable,” she said. \nTime is ripe for banana farmers' business. Having sold Malbhog bananas, a highly popular variety, farmers are harvesting William's hybrid and Grand Naine (G9).But, despite their busy time, farmers of the cash crop are compelled to travel to Kathmandu just to ask the government why they are not getting the insurance amount for the losses they incurred in May.Since Saturday, farmers have been in Kathmandu to claim insurance amounts. On May 31, strong winds over two days destroyed bananas planted on a large area of land in eastern Chitwan. Madhav Ghimire, president of the Chitwan Banana Producers Association, said the storm damaged bananas worth Rs150 million.The farmers’ association claimed it was the worst loss they had ever borne.\"Officials from the insurance companies came to the affected areas and made a report. But it has been months, and they have not released the insurance payout.\"While banana farmers have insured their crops and have not received the claim, insurance companies are hesitant to accept premiums for the new crop. Most of the farmers in Chitwan said they are in a dilemma. \"We are in Kathmandu to settle these two crucial issues,\" said Bishnu Hari Panta, a former president of the association. \"We met with the agriculture minister and the secretary on Sunday.\"\"If farmers remain in the dilemma, how can they grow [the crop]?\" He said that despite paying the insurance, farmers are not getting the compensation. “And if the companies are hesitant to insure the crop, it will put every farmer on the brink.”Experts say climate change is making storms more intense and devastating. Storms, hailstorms, droughts, and floods are also increasing in Nepal and are considered major climate-related disasters.According to the National Climate Change Survey 2022, released by the National Statistics Office, the economic losses on-farm and off-farm sectors in the last five years, excluding significant infrastructure damages, amounted to Rs415.44 billion.The survey report said that drought had been reported as the major disaster, affecting 65.4 percent of households, followed by diseases and insects at 54.3 percent, storms at 46.2 percent, hailstorms at 32.6 percent, floods at 28.5 percent, cold waves at 21.7 percent, landslides at 21.5 percent, and inundation at 17.5 percent.Farmers in Chitwan lament the government’s policy on insurance.On Monday, the group of farmers also met with officials of some insurance companies and the Nepal Insurance Authority at the agriculture minister's quarters. Ghannath Mahato, the association's immediate past president, has a banana farm in Jagatpur that was less affected by May’s storm. His insurance term, too, ended in mid-July or by the end of the last fiscal year, and he needs to renew it for the new fiscal year. \"But insurance companies are reluctant to insure my crop,\" said Mahato, who is a part of the delegation. Since March 14, non-life insurance companies have stopped settling claims for insured farm products after failing to receive government premium subsidies.“I am worried. If the storm, which is frequent in Chitwan, damages my crop, I will be at a huge loss,” he said. “This is the time to spend in the field, but we are knocking on the agriculture minister's door with our grievances.\"In Chitwan, banana plantation covers 3,500 bigha (2,370 hectares). Most of the plantations are in the eastern part of Chitwan.According to the association president Ghimire, they usually get insurance payout late. “Last time, it took 13 months to get the insurance. We are not sure how long it may take for this one.\"Crop insurance was introduced in Nepal with much fanfare. The government formulated directives for crop and livestock insurance in January 2013.Under the scheme, the government provided a 50 percent subsidy on the premium in the first year and raised it to 75 percent in the second year.The premium subsidy was again reduced to 50 percent and raised to 80 percent in 2021. Currently, the government bears 80 percent of the insurance premiums, and the farmers bear the rest.When the insurance scheme started in 2013, there were 802 claims. In the previous fiscal year, the annual claims reached 36,000.Insurance companies say the government has not released the insurance premium amount, so they cannot settle it. \"The agriculture minister has assured us we will settle the issue as soon as possible,\" said Panta. The premium for banana crops has been fixed at Rs275 per tree. In case of loss, the insurance company pays up to 90 percent of it.\"If a farmer planted Malbhog bananas on a biga of land, the insurance premium costs Rs30,339,\" said Panta. \"The farmers have to pay Rs6,070, and the government pays Rs24,269.\" \nWithin hours after President Ramchandra Paudel authenticated the bill to amend the Enforced Disappearances, Enquiry, Truth and Reconciliation Commission Act, the international community welcomed Nepal’s efforts to take the nearly two-decade-long peace process to a logical conclusion.Issuing a joint statement in Kathmandu on Thursday, the United States of America, Switzerland, Australia, the United Kingdom, Norway, Japan, Finland, the European Union, Germany, and France welcomed the bill passed by both houses of the federal parliament.They expressed commitment to explore possible mechanisms for support to Nepal for the benefit of the victims and expressed belief that the continued participation of the victims in decision making processes will aid the effective implementation of the Act.“While we are in the early stages of the process, in order to assess possible future actions, the undersigned look forward to hearing from the Government of Nepal about specific needs to support effective delivery by the Truth and Reconciliation Commission and the Commission on the Investigation of Enforced Disappeared Persons,” the statement read. “Now is the time for all stakeholders to band together in support of bringing this segment of Nepal’s history to a successful conclusion.”President Paudel authenticated the bill earlier in the afternoon. Ending nearly a decade of confusion, the House of Representatives passed the bill on August 14, followed by the validation from the National Assembly on August 22. It was forwarded to President Paudel after Speaker Devraj Ghimire certified it on Wednesday.With the President’s authentication, the bill will come into force once it is published in the Gazette.However, a group of victims, human rights activists and organisations in the country, while welcoming several progressive provisions in the bill, had been demanding revisions in some of the provisions. Dozens of victims even staged a sit-in at New Baneshwar, near the Parliament premises, demanding necessary changes in the provisions that they claim undermine the quest for justice.Their appeal went unheard as both houses of the legislature passed the bill without making any changes. Along with some victim’s groups from the 1996-2006 insurgency, three international human rights organisations and the National Human Rights Commission expressed their reservations to some provisions of the bill.The constitutional human rights watchdog is particularly unhappy with the provision of reducing 75 percent sentencing even in serious violations of human rights. It allows the attorney general to lodge the case demanding just 25 percent of action as per the existing law.The peace process began with the signing of the Comprehensive Peace Accord in 2006 that ended the decade-long Maoist insurgency in the country.Other tasks of the peace process including integration of Maoist combatants and management of the arms of the former rebels were accomplished years ago but the responsibility to serve justice to the conflict victims remained unfinished. \nPresident Ramchandra Paudel has authenticated the bill to amend the Enforced Disappearances Enquiry, Truth and Reconciliation Commission Act on Thursday in accordance with Article 113 (2) of the Constitution of Nepal.Ending nearly a decade of confusion, the House of Representatives passed the Bill on August 14, followed by the validation from the National Assembly on August 22. It was forwarded to President Paudel after Speaker Devraj Ghimire certified it on Wednesday.With the President’s authentication, the Bill is now legally validated and ready for implementation once it is published in the Gazette.The amendment to the Act was necessitated after the Supreme Court in February 2015 struck down provisions that allowed amnesty for serious violations of human rights, directing the government to make necessary revisions. Despite this directive, successive governments until recently made no serious attempts towards changing the law as directed by the top court.The serious visible efforts to this effect was seen when the chiefs of the major three parties on July 1 formed a three-party panel to find a common ground on the contentious provisions in the bill. With consent from the top leadership the mechanism on August 7 reached a written agreement on the bill.Based on the three-party agreement, the Law, Justice and Human Rights Committee of the lower house approved the bill, which was under consideration for over a year, the very next day. The erstwhile Pushpa Kamal Dahal government had in March last year introduced the bill in parliament. It was under consideration for more than a year following differences among the parties on the content until last week’s agreement. \nPrime Minister KP Sharma Oli on Thursday handed over the cash prize to the women’s volleyball team players who participated in the CAVA Women’s Volleyball Nations League-2024.Captain Aruna Shahi and 14 other players received Rs300,000 each at a function held at the prime minister’s residence in Baluwatar. Head coach Jagdish Prasad Bhatta received Rs200,000, while Assistant Coach Bharat Yadav, Manager Nilam Singh Bajracharya and Physio Lokendra Kunwar were honoured with Rs120,000 each.Nepal finished as runner-up in the tournament held on August 1-7 in Kathmandu.On August 15, a Cabinet meeting had decided to provide a total of Rs4.76 million to the players and officials. Prime Minister Oli expressed his happiness over the women’s volleyball players’ success so far and urged them to work hard to set a new record in the coming days, the prime minister’s secretariat said.“I am confident that our players are encouraged to succeed and progress. The government will do its best to provide continuous training and motivation to the players and infrastructure,” said Prime Minister Oli. \nThe Nepali government appoints Ek Narayan Aryal as Chief Secretary, replacing Liladevi Gadtaula, who made history as Nepal's first female in the role.\nPost-monarchy (2008), Nepal has been governed by political parties (Big Three), amidst public discontent, with the 2015 constitution establishing a federal democratic republic despite shortcomings and dissident factions within parties leading to new outfits that have yet to challenge the dominance of established parties.\nOn the night of August 25, in six separate incidents in Pakistan, the Majeed Brigade, a guerilla group of the Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA), launched an attack code “Operation Herof”. The coordinated and simultaneous attacks stunned the country. The militant group shot passengers, especially those from Punjab, travelling to and from Balochistan in Musakhel district after checking their IDs and singling them out. The militants set fire to several vehicles and launched suicide attacks on the security forces. For the past few months, the BLA has been at the forefront of mounting attacks on infrastructures, especially those from the Chinese projects/investments and the Pakistani security forces stationed in Balochistan. Chinese engineers are being kidnapped and killed. These strikes have become a headache for Pakistan as Baloch rebels have targeted the Chinese-built Gwadar port. The Baloch perceived the Chinese investments, including modern residential colonies, as Islamabad’s well-planned move to colonise Balochistan to satisfy the elites from Punjab, especially the Army, by settling people outside the region and reducing the local Baloch population to a minority. Balochistan, Pakistan’s biggest province, is sparsely populated and rich in mineral resources. In March this year, the Baloch insurgents attacked Gwadar port. However, the Baloch insurgency has not remained confined to Balochistan. The Majeed Brigade, formed in 2011, has carried out attacks in other provinces of Pakistan as well.Baloch insurgencyThe Baloch grievances have lingered for decades, and the government has adopted a short-sighted policy to solve the problem. Since the beginning, they have dealt with the problem through discredited Sardars and tried to strike deals. A young group of Balochs is now leading the movement, taking away the leadership from the traditional feudal elites. This is the fifth phase of militancy since its advent in 2001, and it has intensified following the killing of Nawab Akbar Bugti, a Pakistani politician and advocate of Balochistan’s rights, in 2006.The insurgency in Balochistan and increased state security have resulted in the arrest, imprisonment and disappearances of several Baloch rights activists. This action has escalated the insurgency. For example, in 2022, the BLA attacked the Army camps in Panjgur and Naushki, and in March this year, they attempted to attack the Naval base in Turbat. However, the security forces neutralised the militants. The BLA has claimed responsibility for several attacks on security forces and installations. In January 2022, an attack on the check post in Balochistan’s Kech district killed 10 soldiers. The BLA’s Majeed Brigade attempted to enter the Port Authority complex in March 2024, where two soldiers were killed. In November 2023, 14 soldiers were killed in Gwadar in an ambush. Since the beginning, Pakistan has looked for a military solution to the insurgency, increasing the presence of security forces in the province. After the building of Gwadar Port, which the Chinese operate now, the Army has stepped up its operations to provide security. It has been involved in large-scale arrests of activists, but many security forces convicts have disappeared. Despite such protests, the state has failed to take action against those responsible for disappearances.Islamabad had believed that developing ports and infrastructure would have a salutary effect on the Baloch insurgency. However, the development is seen as the Pakistani government’s internal colonisation of the mineral-rich province.Baloch grievancesBesides historical grievances, Baloch’s independence has remained in BLA’s psyche since the 1947 partition. After the four phases of insurgencies in the province, the Pakistani government tried to play one group against the other to control the state until the assassination of the Baloch leader Akbar Bugti during the Musharraf regime. The killing changed the character of the Baloch insurgency, as females are now participating in suicide attacks.Islamabad has attempted to counter Baloch nationalism by inserting Islamic elements in Balochistan. The northern part of Balochistan has remained restive as the Lashkar e Jhangvi, a Deobandi supremacist, terrorist and militant organisation based in Afghanistan, was allowed to operate there. Moreover, during the US presence in Afghanistan, Quetta had become a major centre for Taliban activities. The growing religious extremism is visible as all-girls schools are being ordered to close. The Baloch have often considered themselves as minorities in their province as state-led colonisation of the province has become the norm. There have been several cases of Shia killings in Balochistan.The Aghaz-e-Haqooq-e-Balochistan Package (a scholarship for talented Balochistan students), announced in 2009 by the Syed Yousuf Raza Gillani government, was criticised for being too little, too late. However, the most important part of the package was the payment of Rs120 billion in the next 12 years for the arrears of the Gas Development surcharge from 1954-91.The province’s economic backwardness is always attributed to Islamabad’s stepmotherly attitude. Gas extraction from the province, especially Sui gas, is considered a resource extraction that benefits other provinces except Balochistan. There have been accusations that the Pakistani state is exploiting rich mineral resources without paying royalties to Balochistan’s government. According to “The Voice for Baloch Missing Person”, there have been 7,000 registered disappearances since 2004. The Commission of Inquiry on Enforced Disappearances, appointed by the government in January this year, reported 2,752 active cases of enforced disappearances. The Baloch groups have organised several marches to Islamabad to underline the enforced disappearances. The government considered criminalising those who filed false disappearance cases in 2021 through the Criminal Law (Amendment) Bills to reduce the number of reported missing persons. However, the government was finally forced to reconsider its decision as criminalisation would prevent people from filing cases. Finally, in 2022, the amendment declaring enforced disappearances a heinous crime was passed. According to a 2023 report, there was a 63 percent increase in violence in Balochistan. The Baloch have organised long marches to highlight their grievances, and Mama Baloch has led several of them. In June, the Baloch Raji Machi (National Gathering), organised by the Baloch Yakjehti Committee, protested in Gwadar against extrajudicial killings and disappearances to protect the rights of the Baloch people. Three protestors were shot dead by the Frontier Corp forces during the gathering. The recent attacks are going to compound Pakistan’s security predicaments. They will affect regional stability in the volatile Afghanistan-Pakistan region where the Baloch people live in three countries—Iran, Pakistan and Afghanistan. \nIndia's renewed \"Neighbourhood First Policy\" amid regional changes prompted high-level visits between India and Nepal, highlighting the need for deeper engagement and addressing shared concerns, including China's growing influence in Nepal.\nAmidst widespread political stagnation in Nepal, a proposal to limit the terms of politicians has sparked debate, with proponents arguing for accountability and opponents citing impracticality.\nDemocrat Kamala Harris leads Republican Donald Trump 45% to 41% in a Reuters/Ipsos poll published on Thursday that showed the vice president sparking new enthusiasm among voters and shaking up the race ahead of the November 5 election.The 4 percentage point advantage among registered voters was wider than a 1 point lead Harris held over the former president in a late July Reuters/Ipsos poll. The new poll, which was conducted in the eight days ended Wednesday and had a 2 percentage point margin of error, showed Harris picking up support among women and Hispanics.Harris led Trump by 49% to 36% - or 13 percentage points - among both women voters and Hispanic voters. Across four Reuters/Ipsos polls conducted in July, Harris had a 9-point lead among women and a 6-point lead among Hispanics.Trump led among white voters and men, both by similar margins as in July, though his lead among voters without a college degree narrowed to 7 points in the latest survey, down from 14 points in July.The findings illustrate how the US presidential race has been shaken up over the summer. President Joe Biden, 81, folded his flailing campaign on July 21 after a disastrous debate performance against Trump sparked widespread calls from his fellow Democrats to abandon his re-election bid.Since then, Harris has gained ground against Trump in national polls and those in critical swing states. While national surveys including Reuters/Ipsos’ give important signals on the views of the electorate, the state-by-state results of the Electoral College determine the winner, with a handful of battleground states likely to be decisive.In the seven states where the 2020 election was closest - Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Georgia, Arizona, North Carolina, Michigan and Nevada - Trump had a 45% to 43% lead over Harris among registered voters in the poll.“It’s obvious that running against Harris is more challenging for Trump given the shift in these numbers, but it’s certainly not insurmountable,” said Matt Wolking, a Republican campaign strategist who worked on Trump’s 2020 campaign. He said Trump needs to stay as focused as possible in his campaign “so he’s not scaring” away voters who were leaning his way because they didn’t like Biden.Since formally accepting the Democratic nomination last week, Harris has embarked on a tour of battleground states including Georgia, where Biden had been haemorrhaging support before he ended his campaign.RISING ENTHUSIASMSome 73% of Democratic registered voters in the poll said they were more excited about voting in November after Harris entered the race. And while a March Reuters/Ipsos poll found that 61% of respondents who intended to vote for Biden were doing so mainly to stop Trump, 52% of Harris voters in the August poll were voting to support her as a candidate rather than primarily to oppose Trump.“We see it in this poll that people are more motivated about the future than the past,” said Aimee Allison, founder of She the People, a liberal group that aims to grow the numbers of women of colour in elected office. “They see Kamala Harris as the future, and Republicans see this election as just about Trump. Voters are more likely to be engaged when given the option of ‘more than’ beating Trump.”But Trump voters also voiced enthusiasm about their candidate, with 64% saying their choice was more motivated by backing Trump than opposing Harris.Voters picked Trump as having a better approach to managing the US economy, 45% to 36%, a wider margin than Trump had in another Reuters/Ipsos poll this week.Harris, by contrast, had a 47% to 31% advantage on abortion policy. The issue is salient for Democrats after the conservative US Supreme Court in 2022 struck down women’s national right to abortion. Trump nominated three conservative justices to the court during his 2017-2021 presidency. Some 41% of voters in the poll - and 70% of Democrats - said they were worried the next president might sign a national ban on abortions.The latest poll’s survey period partially overlapped with the August 19-22 Democratic National Convention in Chicago where Harris formally accepted her party’s nomination, and it remains to be seen whether the same level of enthusiasm for Harris will continue.The poll was conducted nationally and gathered responses from 4,253 US adults, including 3,562 registered voters.Independent candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who suspended his campaign on August 23 while the poll was still being conducted, had the support of 6% of voters in the survey. \nThe District Administration Office, Kathmandu, has warned against celebrating the Teej festival with excessive extravagance.The office has appealed to avoid organising ‘unnecessary extravagance and costly events’, stating that those who do so may face legal action under the Social Practices (Reform) Act, 1976, and its regulations.According to the notice, lavish celebrations during Teej have increased in recent years compared to the past.“The Social Practices (Reform) Act, 1976, and its regulations provide clear guidelines for organising religious, social, and cultural festivals. Therefore, the administration strongly requests that no extravagant events be organised,” the notice reads.“Any Teej events featuring unnecessary extravagance and expense will be closely monitored, and legal action as per the prevailing law.” \nMillions of people were told to evacuate from their homes as Typhoon Shanshan lashed southwest Japan with strong winds and heavy rain on Thursday, knocking out power, snarling air traffic and forcing major factories to close.At least three people have been killed so far and scores injured in what authorities have warned could be one of the strongest-ever storms to hit the region.Major automaker Toyota suspended operations in all of its domestic plants due to the storm, while Nissan, Honda and chipmakers Renesas and Tokyo Electron also temporarily halted production at some factories.Funeral parlour employee Tomoki Maeda was in a hearse when the typhoon struck Miyazaki city in southern Kyushu, shattering windows and tearing down walls of some buildings.“I’ve never experienced such a strong wind or tornado in my 31 years of life,” Maeda told Reuters.The typhoon, with gusts of up to 50 metres per second (180 km per hour/112 mph), was near Unzen city in Nagasaki Prefecture at 1:45 pm, moving north at about 15 km per hour, according to the weather agency.Around 230,000 households in seven prefectures were without power in the afternoon, according to Kyushu Electric Power Co. The utility earlier said there was no impact at its Sendai Nuclear Power Plant in Satsumasendai city, where the storm made landfall earlier on Thursday.Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi told a news conference that three people had died and one was missing in incidents related to the typhoon, while the disaster management agency said 45 had suffered injuries.After hovering over Kyushu for the next few days, the storm is expected to approach the central and eastern regions, including the capital Tokyo, around the weekend, the weather agency said.More than 5.2 million people have been issued evacuation notices across the country, authorities said.Madoka Kubo, who runs a hotel in historic city of Hitoyoshi in Kumamoto prefecture, told Reuters that all reservations had been cancelled and her hotel was now being used to house elderly people who had been evacuated from nearby areas.Airlines, including ANA Holdings (9202.T), and Japan Airlines (9201.T), have already announced cancellations of nearly 800 flights. Train services have been suspended in many areas of Kyushu while hundreds of bus and ferry services have also been halted, according to the transport ministry.Typhoon Shanshan is the latest harsh weather system to hit Japan, following Typhoon Ampil, which also led to blackouts and evacuations, earlier this month. \nHeavy rains battered parts of India’s western state of Gujarat this week, flooding cities, snapping utility links and forcing thousands to leave their homes, with at least 28 dead, authorities said on Thursday, warning of more heavy downpours.Army rescue teams have joined the relief effort, as people waded through waist-high waters that have partly submerged vehicles and roads, visuals from Reuters television showed.“There is no electricity for the last two days,” said Prabhu Ram Soni, who lives in the coastal city of Jamnagar. “I have an eight-month-old daughter and an asthma patient, my mother, who is on oxygen support.”Since Sunday, 28 people have died from drowning and rain-related causes, while more than 18,000 have been evacuated from cities near the coasts, disaster management authorities said.Heavy rains continued in Jamnagar, home to the world’s largest oil refinery complex, owned by Reliance (RELI.NS), the district collector, B K Pandya, told Reuters.At nearby Vadinar, Nayara Energy, backed by Russian groups including its largest oil producer, Rosneft, runs another refinery.“They are operational,” Pandya said, when asked if rain had affected work in the refineries, adding that authorities were focusing on rescue efforts in the district.India’s weather office has warned of extremely heavy rainfall forecast on Thursday in Gujarat’s districts of Bharuch, Kutch and Saurashtra, with Friday expected to bring heavy rain, thunderstorms and lightning.The rains have been caused by a deep atmospheric depression off the coast of Gujarat, which has also affected the southern coast of neighbouring Pakistan, with its largest city of Karachi lashed by heavy rain.Officials in Pakistan’s southern province of Sindh warned against torrential rain, rough seas and flooding expected on Thursday, as the weather system moves westwards from India.After recent heavy rains lashed the port city of Karachi, authorities have warned of flash floods in two districts of Sindh still recovering from 2022 floods that inundated large swathes of the country. \nA Hong Kong court on Thursday is expected to hand down verdicts against two editors of a now-defunct online media outlet for conspiring to publish seditious articles in a case that has drawn international scrutiny.This is the first sedition trial against any journalist or editor since Hong Kong’s handover from Britain to China in 1997.It is a case that critics, including the US government, say reflects deteriorating media freedoms under a years-long national security crackdown in the China-ruled city.Stand News, once Hong Kong’s leading online media outlet with a mix of critical reportage and commentary, was raided by police in December 2021 and had its assets frozen, leading to its closure a few days later.Its top editors, Chung Pui-kuen, 54, Patrick Lam, 36, and the outlet’s parent company Best Pencil (Hong Kong) Ltd, were all charged with conspiracy to publish seditious publications in connection with 17 news articles and commentaries between July 2020 and December 2021.All those charged pleaded not guilty. If convicted, they face a maximum two years jail term.During the 57-day trial, government prosecutor Laura Ng alleged Stand News had acted as a political platform to promote “illegal” ideologies and incited readers’ hatred against the Chinese and Hong Kong governments.Ng described the articles as seditious, including interviews with jailed or exiled pro-democracy politicians and a news article about jailed human rights lawyer Chow Hang-tung.Foreign governments including the US, and media freedom advocacy groups said the case showed how authorities had suppressed freedoms and intensified self-censorship since the national security law was passed in 2020.“Report the truth”Chung, who chose to testify in court, was in the witness box for 36 days of the trial, defending media freedoms and saying Stand News had only “recorded the facts and reported the truth”, while giving voice to a spectrum of voices including democrats.“The media should not self-censor but report,” he said.Chung stressed that they upheld the principle of publishing every article they received to “showcase the greatest extent of freedom of speech”, as long as they didn’t immediately cause violence, affect public health and cause defamation.Stand News was forced to shut down and take down all its online content after a police raid.The verdict was originally scheduled to be delivered last October, but it was adjourned three times to wait for the High Court to hand down its ruling on an appeal by a pro-democracy activist Tam Tak-chi against his conviction and sentence on charges which included sedition offences. \nDespite slowed economic growth, Nepal’s external sector appears stronger than ever, thanks to remittances, tourism and the appreciation of the US dollar.Nepal’s three external indicators—foreign exchange reserve, remittance earnings, and tourism income, which represent all international economic transactions between residents of the country—reached a historic high in the last fiscal year that ended mid-July.Conversely, the country’s statistical body, the National Statistics Office, has projected Nepal’s economic growth to be at a meagre 3.87 percent for 2023-24 due to the poor performance of the internal sector. According to experts, the mismatch is due to political uncertainty and growing corruption, as the external sector's growth did not support the internal sector. “It’s good that tourism income has grown. This will generate jobs,” said Nara Bahadur Thapa, former executive director at Nepal Rastra Bank, the country’s central bank. “But at the same time, growing remittance earnings means no job prospects at home. But the money sent by migrant workers has boosted foreign exchange reserves to an all-time high.”Though Nepal is in a remittance trap, the country could turn this into an opportunity by investing in the real sector. “The best option to channel remittances is to bring the private sector on board for investment in the productive sector,” said Thapa.Experts said that since the interest rate on credit has dropped significantly due to the huge amount of liquidity, investment is all that the country needs now. In the last fiscal year, Nepal’s gross foreign exchange reserves increased 32.6 percent to Rs2.04 trillion, a historic high. According to experts, such a trend in a least-developed country indicates no investment. According to the central bank report released on Sunday, remittance inflows increased 16.5 percent to Rs1.44 trillion in the last fiscal year, the highest amount on record.The remittances have been increasing because youth are leaving. In the last fiscal year, foreign employment permits were issued for 741,302 individuals (460,103 first-time and 281,199 renewed). The number is a slight reduction from 774,976 in the previous fiscal year.Under the service account, travel income, or expenditure made by foreign tourists, increased 32.1 percent to Rs82.33 billion in the review year, the highest revenue on record. The total number of tourist arrivals increased to 1.12 million in the last fiscal year from 862,992 in the previous fiscal year.The balance of payments remained at a surplus of Rs502.49 billion in the review year.With the upbeat external sector, the internal sector has remained dismal.“This is because the private sector investment has been shrinking for the last two years,” said Chandra Dhakal, president of the Federation of Nepalese Chambers of Commerce and Industry, the apex private sector body. He was speaking at an interaction in Kathmandu on Sunday.“As Nepal’s industrial capacity is under 40 percent. The private sector investment that contributes 86 percent to the economy has shrunk. This will naturally not generate employment opportunities.”He said that the demand for workers has boomed in the country, where the private sector has thrived. The World Bank said in its recent report that frequent political changes, a significant drag on businesses for over a decade, have dampened private investment. Thriving corruption and lack of accountability have stalled growth and forced tens of thousands of young Nepalis to try their luck abroad.Thapa, a former official at the central bank, said that with billions of dollars in the banks, the incumbent government has an opportunity to take advantage of it.Nepal is currently ruled by an unusual coalition of the two largest parties and this brings both challenges and opportunities. “The government has to facilitate the private sector. It has to ask the private sector to bring forward ready-to-invest projects,” said Thapa. The capital market is gaining momentum. “Through initial public offerings (IPOs) and follow-on public offers (FPOs), the government can facilitate raising money and enable the private sector to invest in the productive sectors that create jobs,” said Thapa. However, political wrangling has paralysed the country.The Securities Board of Nepal (SEBON) and Nepal Tourism Board have been headless for months. Nepal Electricity Authority has yet to open the door for signing the power purchase agreement with the big developers even though the country has huge loanable funds.“The government and the private sector both have to invest,” said Dhakal. “For every rupee the government spends, the private sector has been spending Rs5.”Economists say that the government’s capital injection into the economy would encourage the private sector to pump the investment.Over the years, private investment has remained sluggish. For example, the import restriction imposed by the government two years ago discouraged the private sector from spending, decreasing capital in the market and intermediate goods imports. As a result, public consumption and investment contracted, ultimately impacting the government’s revenue collection.Economists and statisticians say Nepal, which is set to graduate from the least developed countries by 2026, does not have the environment to achieve double-digit economic growth in the immediate future due to low investment from the government and the private sector.The country’s statistical office recently said that, given the ongoing investment, Nepal’s growth rate will neither slow down nor grow. It will remain static. According to economists, everything from wages to business growth and social security to other state benefits will remain static, which will encourage youth to try their luck abroad. \nAs the festive season approaches—a time when consumers are mercilessly exploited—the government is doubling down on its efforts to set up consumer courts for the first time in Nepal, aiming to safeguard consumer rights.It has been nearly two and a half years since the Supreme Court ordered the government to establish consumer courts in all provinces to speed up justice delivery.On Sunday, Industry, Commerce and Supplies Minister Damodar Bhandari told an interaction at the central supply and consumer department of the Nepali Congress that a consumer court would be established within a month.“The presence of the consumer court will have a significant impact on controlling food adulteration, artificial shortage and price manipulation.”But consumer rights activists remain sceptical and dismiss it as yet another lofty promise.Consumers face difficulty accessing water, energy, telecoms and financial services, despite paying for them. Besides, as Nepal’s e-commerce grows, now more than ever, instances of consumers fraud are becoming more prevalent.Nepal’s quality control watchdog, the Department of Food Technology and Quality Control, filed 178 cases in district administration offices against producers and traders for producing and selling substandard food items and animal feed in the last fiscal year. There were 121 cases in the previous fiscal year. Consumer rights activists say the district administrations deliver justice in only a handful of cases.Speaking at the interaction, lawmakers criticised party politics for protecting wrongdoers.They said that whenever market inspection teams raid certain shops or factories, top officials receive phone calls to protect those businesses. On May 28, the budget announced the allocation of necessary funds to set up consumer courts. An official at the Ministry of Industry, Commerce and Supplies said that the government allocated a budget of Rs10 million for administrative expenses to establish at least one consumer court in one of the districts in Kathmandu Valley. However, setting up consumer courts requires a considerable amount of money. As a temporary measure to comply with the Supreme Court’s order, officials plan to rent a separate room in a district administration office to set up the court, which will then begin hearing cases.Consumer rights activists said that forming a court within a month is impossible.“I attended the function when the industry minister Bhandari delivered his speech. We applauded, and the function concluded,” said Prem Lal Maharjan, president of the National Consumers Forum.“This is one of the glaring examples of how promises are made and not delivered.”“A consumer court inside a district administrative office, with a limited budget and few judges, is a joke,” said Maharjan. The top court had ordered the setting up of consumer courts in all 77 districts with separate infrastructure. In mid-June, the Industry Ministry's draft report on establishing a consumer court was submitted to the Law Ministry and sent to the Judicial Council for its suggestions.However, Ashok Kumar Chhetri, spokesperson for the Judicial Council, said he was unaware of the development.“The draft regarding the formation of consumer courts has not come to my notice.” The Consumer Protection Act, 2018, has a provision requiring the government to establish consumer courts. Based on this provision, the Ministry of Industry, Commerce, and Supplies submitted a draft of legislation to the Ministry of Law in September 2019. As the process dragged on, the Supreme Court, on February 20, 2022, ordered the government to establish consumer courts in all provinces to protect buyers' interests amid repeated instances of unfair market practices.A division bench of justices Bam Kumar Shrestha and Nahakul Subedi issued the order after the Forum for Protection of Consumer Rights Nepal moved the court. Although the draft reached the Ministry of Law and then the Ministry of Industry, Commerce, and Supplies, the process has been delayed due to frequent changes in government.According to an official update on the development, the Ministry of Industry cancelled the previous process last year and started afresh by forming a committee.The committee recommended setting up a pilot consumer court in a suitable location within the Kathmandu Valley, in coordination with or on the advice of the Judicial Council, considering the country's current condition and available resources, the official said. According to officials, more consumer courts will be gradually established in other districts based on financial resources.The Industry Ministry official said they realised that setting up just one consumer court per province would not be practical, as people would have to travel long distances for their cases. Therefore, the draft proposes gradually setting up consumer courts in all districts.A consumer court is a specialised court which primarily deals with consumer-related disputes, conflicts, and grievances. The court holds hearings to adjudicate these issues.The public has long been demanding a consumer court to bring unscrupulous traders under a legal framework within a fast-track system.Since consumers often hesitate to get involved in complex court cases, observers believe this has emboldened dishonest traders. They believe that once consumer courts are established, filing complaints will become easier, and the process will involve fewer hassles. \nAnother Olympic Games has come and gone and Nepal’s quest to bring home an official Olympic medal continues to seem like a pipe dream.Nepal sent seven athletes to the 2024 Summer Games in Paris to compete in six different sports but none of them will have anything to show for back home—no athlete from Nepal has won a single official medal in the country’s 60-year Olympic history.But, is it at all realistic to expect an Olympic medal from Nepali athletes?“Winning a medal at the Olympics is not impossible. But our investment and preparation for the Olympics and other international events are woefully inadequate,” said former Olympican Deepak Bista, who currently serves as the president of Nepal Olympians Association and the director of national team preparation, at the National Sports Council. “There are no proper venues for players to train and practice, So how do you compete against elite athletes from around the world?” Athlete Santoshi Shrestha completed the difficult 41.195km track of the women’s marathon event in the 79th position out of 91 athletes. Her timing of 2 hours 55 minutes and 06 seconds was far from her previous best and national record of 2 hours 46 minutes and 23 seconds, which she set on the way to marathon debut gold at Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Dhaka Marathon earlier this year.After the women’s marathon, Santoshi said she could have set a new national record in Paris had she pushed herself more in an endurance-testing track, but she chose not to because of fear of possible injury.“I could not take the risk because the track was very steep after 15 km. I was comfortable and could have made a new record there [in Paris] but I chose to stay in the comfort zone. I want to compete in other tournaments as well,” said Santoshi.But Santoshi’s story could have been different had her preparations and training back home been better. “Further, players, coaches and team management all need to work hard with complete focus and dedication all round the year if they are to bring medals. Sadly, the state of our players is not good enough. They are compelled to find other jobs so that they can look after their families. How can we expect them to win medals at big tournaments?” added Bista, who was the second Nepali athlete to qualify for the Olympics, Beijing 2008.“The players need physical, mental and financial support.”Former Nepali Olympian Sangina Baidya also points to poor investment and preparation in sports for Nepal’s underperformance at the Olympics.“There is a lack of extensive investment in sports infrastructures. The state should be interested in the development of sports. If there is sufficient investment at the youth level, and they get substantial funding, resources and infractures, they can undoubtedly perform better in the international competitions including the Olympics,” said taekwondo practitioner Baidya, who was the first Nepali athlete to qualify for the Olympics, in Athens 2004, through a selection tournament.“In comparison to other successful countries, here in Nepal, preparations for the Olympics start late. They get only a few months of training, which is not enough,” she added.Judoka Manita Shrestha Pradhan has a similar story. She got a training room only two months before the Olympics and she was still expected to win at least one or two bouts in Paris—which is a lot to ask for. Shrestha Pradhan could not progress beyond the first round of women’s 57 kg weight category event.There is no targeted budget for the Olympics programme despite the sports sector getting Rs3.5 billion for the fiscal year 2024/25. Only Rs9 million was allocated for the transport, lodging and food of athletes and officials participating in the Paris Olympics and Paralympics.The Nepal Olympic Committee provides $750 per person to the 10 athletes of the 10 sports under the International Olympic Committee’s Solidarity scholarship, which is insufficient. Swimmers Alexander Shah and Duana Lama trained abroad, in the United States and Thailand, respectively, but the scholarship amount was not enough for them to train at top-class facilities. Lama finished last in her Heat and 30th overall in women’s 200m freestyle.Shah, who was competing at the Olympics for a second consecutive time, will at least return home with some joy. His 51.91 seconds in the men’s 100m freestyle Heat shattered his own previous national record of 52.17 seconds set during the World Aquatic Championship in Doha, Qatar.Badminton star Prince Dahal trained in Sri Lanka and had to travel to Paris 2024 without a coach as Nepali authorities did not send the name of the coach for accreditation and visa process on time.Prince Dahal could not win a single match in the men’s singles group stage. Shooter Sushmita Nepal finished 42nd in the women’s 10m air rifle qualification event. Table tennis player Santoo Shrestha also exited the Olympics from the men’s singles preliminary round.But big investment in sports may not always do the trick.Santoo Shrestha, who competed in the men’s singles table tennis at Paris Olympics, was the only third player in Nepal’s Olympic history to qualify for the Olympics through the selection stage—which is a perfect demonstration of how poor the country is technically.Take Jamaica and Kenya. Athletes in these countries are highly successful in athletics.Jamaica—the home of sprinter Usian Bolt, eight time Olympic gold medallist and world record holder in the 100 metres, 200 metres, and 4 × 100 metres relay—has won a total of 87 medals at the Olympics. Of them 86 have come from track and field.Kenya is the most successful African country at the Olympics, with a total of 124 medals so far. Of them 117 are from track and field and seven from boxing.Ethiopia is another nation which focuses on long-distance events. Their total of 58 Olympic medals have all come in long-distance events in athletics.India was once a dominant country in field hockey and won a record 11 Olympic medals, including eight golds between 1928 and 1980. Although the country experienced a drought in hockey medals, the sport is gradually finding new success after its team picked two consecutive hockey bronze medals in Tokyo 2020 and Paris 2024. Wrestling and shooting are the other sports Indian athletes specialise in.“The government should learn from how other countries prepare their athletes,” said Bista, suggesting that Nepal should target some sports for the 2028 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles and prepare accordingly.Nepal has won a total of 26 medals at the Asian Games. Of them, it has bagged 24 medals in martial arts, which include karate (4), taekwondo (14) and boxing (6). “Nepal should select sports in which Nepal is historically good, for instance martial arts. After that, the government should allocate a significant budget just for the Olympics programme and train the players from the beginning if it expects our athletes to do better,” Bista added.Technically, Nepal’s only medal at the Olympics came in 1988 in Seoul when Bidhan Lama won a bronze medal in the men’s 50kg weight category taekwondo competition. But his medal was counted as unofficial as the sport was then an exhibition event. Taekwondo entered the Olympics programme only at Sydney 2000.But the 2026 Asian Games in Aichi-Nagoya, Japan could be a head start.The National Sports Council has launched Mission 2026 as part of the preparations for the next Asiad and has targeted at least 10 medals. But, sadly, the government has only approved Rs20 million for the programme.“We don’t have enough funding for the programme. This amount will support our athletes for only five to six months. It is unfortunate that the government could not embrace the NSC’s mission.” Bista said, adding that he fears Mission 2026 will just be an ambitious dream.But Bista hopes Palesha Goverdhan may change history despite the odds. Goverdhan became the first Nepali paralympian to pass the selection stage when she qualified for the Paris Paralympics. She won a gold medal in the Asian Qualifiers in China.Govardhan also won a bronze at the 2022 Asian Para Games, becoming the first Nepali para athlete to win a medal at the event.“Palesha is training in London under one of the best trainers,” said Bista who added that the NSC is paying her training fees. \nKunwar has been the MD for just under three years. Before coming back to her homeland to join Daraz Nepal, she worked at different American companies, including Amazon, the world’s biggest e-commerce platform. In this conversation, Kunwar talks about the opportunities and challenges of running an e-commerce enterprise in Nepal, as well as the country’s overall business environment.  \nWhen the Ranjitkar group was established, they discovered this forgotten dance and devoted two years to researching it.Now, they are reintroducing it during Indra Jatra by training the new generation in this traditional art form. \nHe is known for his nationalist legacy, marked by the amendment of Nepal's map to include territories like Kalapani, Lipulekh, and Limpiyadhura, and his strong stance against India, especially during and after the 2015 Nepal blockade.But how did he rise to become the country's powerful man? \nPyakuryal holds a Phd in Public Affairs from the University of Akron, US. In this interview, they discuss Nepal’s elusive political stability, the narratives governing Nepali politics, the role of patriarchy, and the trends in Nepali politics Pyakuryal will be closely following in the years ahead. \nGhimire Yubaraj has been involved in the Nepali drama for over two decades. He is the founder and artistic director of Shilpee Theatre, Battisputali. He graduated from Commedia International Theatre School, Denmark, in 2011. Although he studied commerce in high school, he joined a year-long course in acting organised by Rastriya Nach Ghar and started his career in theatre.He also published three books: ‘Bimokshya’, ‘Aandhi ko Manoram Nritya’ and ‘Rupantaran ka Laagi Rangamanch’. He has directed over two dozen dramas and acted in about one and a half dozen dramas. In this conversation with the Post’s Timila Maharjan, Yubaraj explains how books and literature have helped him grow as a director and an actor.How did you discover your love for books?Since school, I’ve been passionate about fiction books, influenced by how my teachers brought folk stories and poetry to life. My father also played a role in my literary interests. He was a voracious reader of spy novels, which I didn’t find captivating, but he introduced me to Nepali literature.At school, I studied works by authors like BP Koirala, Dhruba Sapkota, and Dhruba Chandra Gautam, which deepened my love for reading and writing. School literary activities further nurtured my interest.I had access to more literary resources when I moved to Kathmandu for college. The Nepal-Bharat libraries offered free access to books, including Nepali literary magazines, contemporary literature, and academic texts. Reading became my escape, providing a peaceful retreat from everyday life.Which books or authors have had a significant impact on your work? Can you give an example of how a particular book shaped a production or a character you developed?Different books and authors have shaped my literary journey at various stages of my life. I went through a phase where I was captivated by Indian dramas, especially those by Mohan Rakesh, like ‘Ashadh Ka Ek Din’ and ‘Aadhe Adhure’. Later, I became a Girish Karnad, Badal Sarkar, and Vijay Tendulkar fan. I even acted in Karnad’s ‘Yayati’ at Shilpee.My interest then shifted to Shakespeare, though I found his language challenging. Studying Shakespeare’s works, such as ‘Macbeth’, ‘Hamlet’, ‘The Tempest’, ‘Richard III’, ‘As You Like It’, and ‘A Midsummer Night’s Dream’, in Denmark taught me the magic of poetic language.Henrik Ibsen’s ‘A Doll’s House’ and ‘Hedda Gabler’ were crucial in understanding drama’s structure and social realism. I also enjoyed Anton Chekhov’s long plays, like ‘The Seagull’, ‘Three Sisters’, ‘Uncle Vanya’, and ‘The Cherry Orchard’, performing ‘Three Sisters’ at Shilpee.Other influential works include ‘Jhaphal Satra’, ‘No Exit’, and ‘The Respectful Prostitute’. Albert Camus, Arthur Miller, and Tennessee Williams’ three-act plays also influenced my writing and perception.Nepali writers like Laxmi Prasad Devkota, Bal Krishna Sama, Gopal Prasad Rimal, Parijat, and Shankar Lamichhane have greatly influenced me. I have a special attachment to Parijat’s novel ‘Sirish Ko Phool’ and her other works, and I visited Burma to reflect on her writings. I also admire Nayan Raj Pandey and Kumar Nagarkoti’s recent works.Additionally, I appreciate Nepali authors like Khagendra Sangraula, Narayan Wagle, and Archana Thapa, as well as George Orwell, especially his dramas ‘Burmese Days’, ‘Animal Farm’, ‘1984’, and his essay ‘Shooting an Elephant’.Do you have a routine or specific time set aside for reading, or is it spontaneous?I don’t have a fixed reading schedule, but I prefer reading in my home library. I’ll read in bed or in the bathroom if that's uncomfortable. I need a quiet, personal space to avoid distractions, as interruptions make it hard for me to concentrate, and I often have to start over.How do books impact your process when creating new plays or performances?For me, study and writing are gateways to the creative world. Even when I'm not actively creating, they provide an escape from daily life. I can't write, direct, or act without diverse experiences. I need a solid understanding of the subject I'm working on, or else the process becomes a struggle, like trying to start a fire with damp wood. Literature from various writers broadens my perspective, introducing me to different environments, characters, cultures, and thought processes. It also pushes my imagination beyond clichés.You are also an author and have written books like Bimokshya, Aadhi ko Manoram Nritya and Rupantaran ka Laagi Rangamanch. So, what are the things that motivated you to write books?Initially, I wrote poetry and stories out of curiosity and interest. However, writing has become a deeper desire over the past ten years, especially after working in theatre. I've performed in many plays by both national and international writers, but there's always been a gap, a desire for certain stories that led me to create my dramas. Writing allows me to express emotions that acting and directing can’t fully convey. After experiencing various plays, reading books, and immersing myself in art and literature, different emotions—sometimes anger or pain—urge me to speak out. Writing gives me the freedom to express those feelings in unique ways. That's why I love writing.Is there a particular book you return to time and again for inspiration or comfort?I often revisit BP Koirala's books. I've read his biography thrice and think I'll read it again. Similarly, I've read ‘Hitler ra Yahudi’, ‘Sirish Ko Phool’, and ‘The Moving Body’ by Jacques Lecoq multiple times and always return to them. I also frequently read Peter Brook's works.Ghimire Yubaraj’s book recommendationsThe Hour We Knew Nothing of Each Other Author: Peter HandkePublisher: Yale University PressYear: 1989Handke’s postmodern play has over 300 characters, and they keep changing or shifting throughout the performance.No Exit Author: Jean-Paul SartrePublisher: Samuel French IncYear: 1944This amazing book explores questions about human existence and shares the author's philosophical insights.The Nordic Secret Author: Lene Rachel Andersen and Tomas Bjorkman Publisher: Fri TankeYear: 2017This one highlights how knowledge contributed to Europe's social and physical development and showcases the peak use of science and technology.Mero Kabita ko AradhanAuthor: Balkrishna SamaPublisher: Sajha PrakashanYear: 1972This book is an honest memoir by Natya Siromani Bal Krishna Sama and serves as a great example of memoir writing.Hitler ra YahudiAuthor: BP KoiralaPublisher: Sajha PrakashanYear: 1958 Koirala offers a fresh perspective on war, using language I admire.

He has a strong grip on the party’s newly formed central committee as well.On Monday, the Unified Socialist announced a two-day election schedule. On Tuesday, central committee members cast their votes to elect 18 office bearers and 105 politburo members.The party’s 344 central committee members were the voters.Among the four vice-chairs elected in the open category, Gangalal Tuladhar, Jagannath Khatiwada, and Prakash Jwala are from the Nepal camp while Bhanubhakta Joshi is from the camp led by General Secretary Ghanashyam Bhusal.Another vice-chair from the Bhusal faction is Dharmanath Prasad Sah, who got elected vice-chair under the Madhesi category, defeating Ram Chandra Jha of the Nepal side. Nepal camp won vice-chair of the women’s category with Jayanti Rai beating Ram Kumari Jhakri of the Bhusal faction.Birodh Khatiwada, Lalit Bahadur Chhetri, Urbadatta Panta, Shadhya Bahadur Bhandari, Bijay Paudel, Keshav Lal Shrestha and Balaram Banskota lost the vice-chair race.For the four positions of deputy general secretary, the Nepal camp fielded Rajendra Kumar Rai, Laxman KC, Ram Chandra Yadav and Rajkumar Bhattarai. Of them, Rai and Bhattarai were elected from the same camp. Also, Metmani Chaudhary and Garima Shah won the same positions without the camp’s backing.Sabitra Bhusal, Srinath Baral, Som Prasad Pandey, Sher Bahadur Kunwar, and Ganesh BK got elected as secretaries from the Nepal side. Chandra Bahadur Shahi and Baldev Chaudhary, who were not in Nepal’s panel, won secretary positions.Some leaders accused party chair Nepal of mobilising his faction to help leaders loyal to him win. According to the leaders, the Nepal faction had prepared a list of candidates and circulated it among the central committee members and asked them to vote only for them, despite his pledge to form committees based on consensus among top leaders. “After being elected the party chair unanimously, Madhav Kumar Nepal had promised to pick other office bearers through consensus,” a party leader, requesting anonymity, told the Post. “He later managed to nominate his loyalists to the central committee. When he has a majority in the committee, it is obvious that leaders close to him are elected office bearers.”Rajendra Pandey, who was elected senior vice-chair unopposed, is close to the party chairman.The Nepal faction had circulated a list among the members asking them to vote for Gangalal Tuladhar, Prakash Jwala, Jagannath Khatiwada, Keshav Lal Shrestha in the vice-chair race.Though the general convention hall had mandated appointing 299 central committee members when forming the committee, the party increased the number of central committee to 344, says a party leader.A list of 93 central committee members was announced at the party's general convention, held from June 30 to July 5 in Kathmandu, with the rest to be elected later. The general convention elected Nepal the party chair, Bhusal the general secretary and Jhala Nath Khanal the senior leader unopposed.A task force comprising Chairman Nepal, senior leader Khanal, and General Secretary Bhusal had finalised the names of the central committee members. As per the task force's recommendation, the party announced 251 central committee members on August 2. The election body that conducted polling on Tuesday was counting votes cast for politburo members until late Wednesday evening. “The final result of politburo members will come out by Wednesday midnight,” said party leaders. The Unified Socialist, formed after a faction split from the CPN-UML in 2021, has 10 lawmakers in the 275-strong House of Representatives. \nThe CPN (Unified Socialist) on Tuesday elected its office bearers through a voting in Kathmandu.Gangalal Tuladhar, Bhanu Bhakta Joshi, Prakash Jwala, and Jagannath Khatiwada were elected vice-chairpersons under open category. Tuladhar received 189 votes, Khatiwada 161, Joshi 156, and Jwala 139.The Unified Socialist Party has a provision for electing four vice-chairpersons under the open category out of six vice-chairpersons.In the women’s vice-chairperson category, Jayanti Rai defeated Ram Kumari Jhakri. Rai secured 199 votes, while Jhakri managed only 112. Likewise, Dharmanath Prasad Sah was elected vice-chairperson under the Madheshi category, receiving 164 votes, while his rival Ram Chandra Jha garnered 144 votes.Metmani Chaudhary, Rajendra Kumar Rai, Ram Kumar Bhattarai, and Garima Shah were elected deputy general secretaries. Chaudhary received 158 votes, Bhattarai and Shah each garnered 107 votes, and Rai got 106 votes.Likewise, Baldev Chaudhary from the indigenous category and Ganesh Bishwakarma from the Dalit category were elected secretaries. Chaudhary received 175 votes, and Bishwakarma got 180 votes.Similarly, Sher Bahadur Kunwar, Som Prasad Pandey, Chandra Bahadur Shahi, Sabitra Bhusal, and Shreenath Baral were elected as secretaries under the open category. Kunwar received 153 votes, Pandey 141, Bhusal 106, and Shahi 91.The elections for these positions were held among central committee members. Rajendra Pandey was elected unopposed as the senior vice-chairperson. The party’s general convention, held in Kathmandu from June 30 to July 5, unanimously elected Madhav Kumar Nepal as chairman, Ghanashyam Bhusal as general secretary, and Jhala Nath Khanal as senior leader.The party’s central committee members voted to elect the office bearers on Tuesday, two months after the general convention.The party’s statute mentions that it will have 21 office bearers.After the general convention unanimously elected the chairman and general secretary, the office bearers were expected to be appointed based on consensus. However, party insiders said leaders close to Chairman Nepal lobbied hard to hold an election for office bearers. \nAs the dispute between the government and Kulman Ghising, the executive director of Nepal Electricity Authority (NEA) lingers, CPN (Maoist Centre) Chairman and former prime minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal has backed Ghising.When six of the industries failed to pay the tariff for using the specialised feeder and trunk line to obtain electricity, the NEA had last month cut off the power supply of those industries. For days, despite the written order of the Electricity Regulatory Commission and the verbal orders of Prime Minister Oli, NEA chief Ghising had refused to restore power to six industries.NEA later supplied the electricity to the industries but by then relations between Prime Minister Oli and Ghising had soured.NEA also cut off the power to some industries in January this year. NEA resumed supply to the industries following the government’s recommendation.Dahal, also the leader of the main opposition in the House of Representatives, addressing the House on Tuesday said that his party would support Prime Minister Oli if the latter decides to collect the electricity tariff arrears amounting to almost Rs22 billion from the Cabinet.The industrialists owe roughly Rs8.25 billion—Rs 6.65 billion plus a 25 percent fine—according to the NEA. Industrialists who used the exclusive feeder and trunk lines for energy were first estimated by the NEA to owe almost Rs22 billion. But the arrears were adjusted when the government-appointed commission's advice was taken into account in order to resolve the disagreement.The commission of inquiry tasked with resolving the tariff dispute of dedicated and trunk lines submitted its report to the Dahal government on May 6. Commission chair Girish Chandra Lal, a former Supreme Court justice, had submitted its report to Energy, Water Resources and Irrigation Minister Shakti Bahadur Basnet. The commission was formed on January 9.Based on the commission’s report, the Dahal government decided to adjust the outstanding amount and collect Rs6.65 billion and 25 percent fine to it. However, speaking in Parliament on Tuesday, Dahal challenged the Oli government to go against his government’s decision.“The NEA has so far issued bills of almost Rs22 billion. Let the upcoming Cabinet make a decision to recover this,” Dahal said.The regulation related to the NEA’s billing has no provision to discount the amount, despite the commission’s recommendation, says NEA spokesperson Chandan Kumar Ghosh.“But when the government also gave a similar kind of order, NEA, an organ of the government, had no other choice than to obey the order,” Ghosh told the Post.As the NEA pressures the industries to clear their earlier dues and some have paid their bills, many say they will not do so until they receive the time of day (TOD) meter data from the NEA.In response, the NEA earlier this month provided the parliamentary Public Account Committee (PAC) with an extensive record of the energy supplied to the industries through dedicated feeders and trunk lines, including the TOD metre data.A tough debate over the electricity tariff also occurred recently in the Public Account Committee between the lawmakers of the CPN-UML and the Maoist Centre.The parliamentary committee received over 100,000 papers from the state-owned electricity provider detailing logbooks, invoicing in Ampere, data from TOD metres, and specifics of bills given to industries.Since the row between the government and the NEA, Prime Minister Oli and NEA head Ghising are giving statements against each other.Defending Ghising, Maoist Centre Chairman Dahal accused Prime Minister Oli of being responsible for the failure to raise the electricity tariff.“The prime minister has asked via Facebook why almost Rs22 billion in tariffs was not collected for nine years,” Dahal said. “The person who is supposed to give an answer should not have asked the question.”Dahal also accused Prime Minister Oli of not letting NEA do its job.On May 14, 2018, the study committee formed by the NEA on the issue of trunk line and dedicated line came up with a report that 61 industrial houses used electricity from the dedicated trunk line but did not pay the tariff, and the NEA had started charging them accordingly, Dahal said in the House meeting.“At that time, Oli had ordered power supply to the industries be cut off,” Dahal accused. “Even some connections to factories were cut off to raise money, but later, with direct orders from Oli, they were restored.”Ghising was appointed the executive director of the power utility during Dahal’s prime ministership in 2016. Later, he was dismissed from the position during Oli’s tenure in 2021. However, the subsequent government led by Nepali Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba reappointed Ghising as the NEA head the same year.A decade ago, when there was severe load-shedding, the whole country faced power cuts for hours. It was during Ghising’s first tenure that the outages ended. The Maoist Centre has been capatilising on the success ever since.Maoist leaders often say that load-shedding had ended when their party led the government.When the dispute between the government and the NEA leadership continued, Oli, in the questions-answer session of Parliament on August 23, said that the dues for power delivered via specialised feeders and trunk lines to the industries would be recovered.Money will be collected but not by cutting off power supply, Oli said. \nAlmost two months after concluding the party's general convention, the CPN (Unified Socialist) on Monday decided to elect its office bearers through a vote.“Discussions were held for long on whether to appoint the office bearers based on consensus or through a vote,” Jeevanram Shrestha, a leader of the party, told the Post. “Eventually the party has now decided to elect them through voting.”On the second day of the central committee meeting on Monday, the party decided to hold the election for the office bearers.The party’s election body published the two-day election schedule that started Monday. As per the timeline, nomination for the position of office bearers started on Monday while voting will start on Tuesday afternoon.The party's general convention, held in Kathmandu from June 30 to July 5, unanimously elected Madhav Kumar Nepal as chairman, Ghanashyam Bhusal general secretary, and Jhalanath Khanal as senior leader.The party’s statute mentions that it will have 21 office bearers. Since the party charter does not acknowledge the senior leader as an office bearer, the organisation now has to elect 19 office bearers to fill the vacant positions. After the general convention elected the chairman and general secretary unanimously, the office bearers were expected to be appointed based on consensus. However, party insiders said leaders close to Chairman Nepal lobbied hard to hold an election for office bearers.In a brief interview with the Post soon after being elected as party chair, Nepal had said the rest of the party secretariat also will be elected based on consensus. “We are trying to elect the secretariat members based on consensus,” Nepal had said. But, the process to elect the office bearers halted for long. When it started, the party decided to go for the election. “When the general convention was concluded in consensus, General Secretary Bhusal and senior leader Khanal were in favour of appointing the office bearers unanimously,” a party leader told the Post on the condition of anonymity. “Chairman Nepal, who commands a strong majority in the central committee, however, lobbied to elect them through voting.” The party’s central committee members will vote to elect the office bearers. At present the Unified Socialist has a 344-member central committee. A total of 93 central members were announced at the general convention held in July first week, while the remaining 251 members were selected on August 2. In the second phase, a task force comprising Chairman Nepal, senior leader Khanal and General Secretary Bhusal had finalised the names of the central members.As of Monday evening, Rajendra Pandey and Pramesh Hamal, who are close to the party chair, are preparing to contest for the post of senior vice chair position. The Khanal-Bhusal group is adopting a strategy not to field any candidate for this position and support one of them, says a party insider.“Beduram Bhusal, who became general secretary immediately after the formation of the party, was an aspirant for the post of senior vice chair,” the leader said. “However, he has agreed to support Hamal.”Chairman Nepal commands a strong majority in the party while Khanal and General Secretary Bhusal lead a separate faction. But the Nepal-led faction is divided into sub-factions which are led by Pandey and Hamal. The two leaders–Pandey and Hamal–are in a race to become the senior vice-chair. Apart from Beduram Bhusal, Hamal also has the support of senior leader Khanal, said multiple party leaders.Party insiders expect tough competition for the vice chair of the Madhesh Province as well. Ramchandra Jha and Dharmendra Prasad Sah are contesting for the position. Former deputy general secretaries Bijay Paudel, Prakash Jwala, Ganga Lal Tuladhar and Jagannath Khatiwada are contesting for the position of vice-chairs. Paudel and Jwala are from General Secretary Bhusal’s camp while Tuladhar and Khatiwada are from chairman Nepal’s camp. The party’s statute has a provision for seven vice-chairs. Likewise, former secretaries of the party, Birodh Khatiwada, Ramkumari Jhakri, Hari Prasad Parajuli, Nagendra Chaudhary, Rajendra Rai, Ambar Bahadur Thapa, Jeevan Ram Shrestha and Garima Shah, are contesting for the deputy general secretary positions.Deputy general secretary candidates Jhakri, Thapa and Khatiwada are from Nepal’s faction and are close to Rajendra Pandey’s team. Parajuli, Shrestha and Shah are close to General Secretary Bhusal. Chaudhary and Rai, though are from Nepal’s camp, try to maintain neutrality. According to party leaders, there are more than 50 aspirants for the seven positions of secretaries. The party now has to elect a senior vice-chair, seven vice chairs including one woman, four deputy general secretaries, and seven secretaries. Prior to the general convention, the party had amended its statute to increase the number of office bearers to 21, besides the senior leader.A group of CPN-UML leaders led by Nepal split the country’s largest communist party to form the CPN (Unified Socialist) on August 25, 2021. Nepal earlier served as the chief of the CPN-UML for 15 years. They split the party, protesting against UML chair KP Sharma Oli’s decision to dissolve the House of Representatives twice accusing him of trampling the new constitution and instigating political instability in the country.Following a poor performance in local and general elections in 2022, the Unified Socialist is now struggling to retain party members. In the federal and provincial elections, it failed even to secure the status of a national party. The party won only 10 seats in the 275-member House of Representatives in the general elections.Despite holding important portfolios in the federal and provincial governments, the party leaders find it difficult to stop its cadres from rejoining their old party, the UML, let alone attracting new members.  \nTwo and half months after its general convention, the Janata Samajbadi Party-Nepal picked office-bearers and central committee members.Chairman Upendra Yadav was given the mandate to select the party’s leadership without holding an election after the general convention was concluded without electing office bearers following the registration of candidacies for the positions.Chairman Yadav on Monday appointed a 30-member central executive committee and 27 central members and named the members of the central discipline commission, central audit commission, and central election commission.JSP-Nepal announced its central members and nine-member central executive committee after a month of the convention, but it struggled to pick office bearers.Rakam Chemjong has been appointed as co-chairman, while Raj Kishor Yadav, Mrigendra Kumar Singh Yadav, Govinda Chaudhary, Shivalal Thapa Magar, and Bidyut Bajracharya have been named vice-chairmen.The party has named Lalbabu Raut and Ram Kumar Sharma as general secretaries, while Manish Kumar Suman has been given the role of spokesperson. Prakash Adhikari, Deepak Karki, and Rekha Yadav have been appointed deputy general secretaries.The party has appointed seven secretaries: Leela Sitaula, Shailendra Sah, Suni Lama, Raj Kumar Rai, Suresh Mandal, Lakpa Sherpa, and Kamruddin Rai. Surita Kumari Sah has been appointed as the treasurer.The newly appointed 30-member central executive committee includes ten members. The members of the central discipline commission, central audit commission, and central election commission have also been selected. \nPanic gripped locals in ward 12 of Chandragiri Municipality, Kathmandu, on Thursday morning after a suspicious object was found in the locality.The suspicious object was spotted in front of Balambu Secondary School, sparking fears of a bomb threat.Locals informed the police, and a bomb disposal team from the Nepal Army arrived at the scene. According to the NA Directorate of Public Relations and Information, the team disposed of the suspicious object, which turned out to be a pressure cooker.   \nKathmandu Metropolitan City has extended the area to prohibit building any structure on either side of the rivers in its territory.In a notice on Wednesday, the city office stated that construction of any structure has been barred on the additional 20 meters from the existing prohibited area.According to the metropolis notice, if the city has, under the existing rule, prohibited any construction on 20 meters from the area marked as river, the prohibited area will now be altogether 40 meters on either side of the waterway.The metropolis said the decision was taken based on a recent Supreme Court verdict that directed the authorities concerned to prohibit construction within an additional 20 metres from riverbanks in the Kathmandu Valley.Currently, construction is permitted only 20 metres beyond major riverbanks in the Kathmandu metropolis.The notice issued by the metropolis states, “No construction will be permitted on an additional 20 metres of land on either side of the river, and ongoing construction will be halted.”It has also asked one and all not to release contaminated water, including sewage, into Bagmati River and its tributaries. “Private and government buildings, as well as commercial properties, must install soak pits for groundwater recharge,” it said. “Waste must not be disposed of in the rivers. Non-compliance will lead to legal action under existing laws.” \nThe rhythmic beat of the Dha echoes through a Bhaktapur alley, blending with the energetic footsteps of dancers. Bhaktapur, which sees jatras and festivals round the year, is no stranger to music, dance and celebrations. But this is not an ordinary occasion. The performers in question are Lakhe dancers who are reviving the Ranjitkar Lakhe dance after a century.The young dancers are preparing for Indra Jatra this year, where mask-clad Lakhe dancers roam the streets to rid the community of hardships and suffering. Lakhe, demon deities revered as protectors of people and crops, are thought to reside in the demonic mask. As the dancer dons the mask, the spirit is said to take over.Bhaktapur was once a key site for the Ranjitkar Lakhe performances, but the art form vanished from the city after the 1934 earthquake.“Bhaktapur suffered the most damage during the 1934 earthquake,\" says Ganesh Ram Ranjit, treasurer of the Ranjitkar Group’s Bhaktapur branch. “The destruction left residents struggling to recover for a decade, making it nearly impossible to perform the costly Lakhe dance.”The Ranjitkar Group discovered the extinct dance in the year the group was established. They located a Lakhe temple in Bhaktapur that had closed after the earthquake. After two years of research, they learned that performing the Lakhe dance was seen as a good omen in Bhaktapur and involved hosting community feasts. However, the high cost of this tradition forced many to sell their properties, rendering it unfeasible in the city’s post-earthquake conditions. Over time, the dance was abandoned as more lands supporting these cultural events were lost during rapid urbanisation.“There was a significant decline in our engagement with our cultural heritage,” says Rabi Shakya, a sculptor and Lakhe dance teacher training the new dancers. “The encouraging change now is the strong interest from the new generation, which is making it possible to revive intangible heritage like this dance.”After 100 years, the Ranjitkar Lakhe Dance is making a return to Bhaktapur at this year’s Indra Jatra.“It’s challenging to accurately re-enact the dance since it hasn’t been seen in a century,” Shakya notes. “As a sculptor, I drew inspiration from Bhaktapur’s revered Shree Navadurga Bhawani to create the Lakhe’s mask.” Similarly, the dance was choreographed by studying Lakhe dances from Kathmandu, Patan, and Banepa within the Ranjitkar community, and combining them with traditional steps from Bhaktapur Lakhe dances.“As for the musical instruments, we are using traditional instruments like Dha, Dhime, and Ponga, which are said to excite the Lakhe,” says Rajendra Maharjan, Lakhe dance teacher and musician.Maharjan is one of the experienced Newari arts teachers working to revive the lost Lakhe dance. He is involved in training young students in cultural arts and is now dedicated to the Ranjitkar dance training, with the students practising together nearly every day.“Becoming a Lakhe performer involves more than just wearing the costume and mask,” said Sudin Ranjit, a Lakhe dance student. “We must train extensively with our teachers, and it demands a lot of hard work.”To Ranjit, a resident of Bhaktapur, the training is more than learning a new craft; it is a matter of protecting culture. Growing up only interested in instruments, he slowly understood how important continuing cultural practices like Lakhe dances is for their community.“The dance will not only bolster Bhaktapur’s cultural pride but also boost tourism and create jobs,” says Dr Purushottam Lochan Shrestha, a professor and researcher specialising in Bhaktapur and Newari culture.Shrestha notes that reviving the dance would offer employment to everyone involved, from the dancers and the sculptor making the masks to those participating in the rituals. “Economic centres throughout the city, from small businesses to large industries, will benefit from the influx of tourists attracted by the Lakhe dance,” Shrestha adds, commending the Ranjitkar group's initiative.Once the Ranjitkar community revitalises the Lakhe dance, the Ranjitkar group plans to set up a new Guthi house with a fresh community fund and organise annual events for the dance.“The Lakhe dance won’t let them separate,” Shakya remarks.In today’s globalised world, where identity often merges into a homogenised blend, shared cultural practices provide a sense of connection and belonging. This new Lakhe dance embodies that spirit of togetherness for the community involved.“Reviving the dance after 100 years,” Shakya says, “is about preserving our culture for the next 300 years.” \nThe Lions Club of Kathmandu Corporate, Nepal MD325-D has felicitated various personalities as part of its endeavour to recognise the contribution of the individuals and business entities for the society.As part of its campaign, the Lions Club of Kathmandu honoured Prateek Pradhan with Social Journalism Award, Sylapa T Rimponche with Social Spiritual Award, Erika Gurung with Social Player Award, Ramesh Corporation with Social Corporate House Award, Rajendra Malla with Social Corporate Leader Award and Rajesh Hamal with Social Celebrity Award.Likewise, Chandra Ghimire is honoured with Social Bureaucratic Award, Binod Das with Sports Management Award, Anil Kedia with Social Academic Award, Mohan Ojha with Social Management Award and Surya Nepal with Corporate Social Responsibility Award.The Lionism embarked in Nepal in 1971 as the Lions Club of Biratnagar under the stewardship of former Prime Minister Matrika Prasad Koirala.The Lions Clubs International says it has over 2,000 clubs operating across the nation. \nThe government has declared a public holiday in the Kathmandu Valley on Sunday to celebrate the Bhoto Jatra.On the occasion of the festival, a public holiday has been declared in the three districts of Kathmandu Valley [Kathmandu, Lalitpur, and Bhaktapur], according to a statement by Narayan Prasad Bhattarai, spokesperson for the Ministry of Home Affairs, on Friday.The government announces a public holiday each year on this occasion.The month-long chariot-pulling festival of Rato Machhindranath concludes with the displaying of a bhoto (a jewel-studded vest) at Jawalakhel, Lalitpur. It is an annual cultural and religious ritual of displaying the black jewel-studded vest believed to be of then Nagraj, the serpent King.Machhindranath is revered as the God of rain, good harvest and prosperity. Paying homage to Lord Machhindranath is believed to bring good luck and fulfil one’s wishes. \n\n\nNepal’s largest auto show opened in Kathmandu on Tuesday. The biggest names showed off their latest products, particularly electric vehicles (EVs), which dominated the show, underlining how the country’s market is already in an all-electric state of mind.Organisers said automakers and dealers unveiled a slew of new models with discounts and bank finance galore.This is the 16th edition.Finance Minister Bishnu Prasad Paudel opened the auto show by saying that the monetary policy unveiled recently did not address the automobile sector, but the government has some plans to boost the sector, and amendments to the policy will be made accordingly.“We will take an appropriate move on electric vehicle (EV) policy amid the ongoing demand.”The auto show is expected to see transactions worth around Rs20 billion.Paudel said that the time has come to assemble vehicles in Nepal rather than continue to import all of them.“We are ready to extend every support to the manufacturers if they intend to establish a plant here,” he said.The government closely monitors the auto fair, which may provide a much-needed tax boost to the ailing economy amid the slowdown.Paudel said the auto fair was a significant event contributing to the government’s revenue.Dealers say that sales may get a boost after a recession in the auto sector for two consecutive years.According to the organisers, more than 50 auto brands are on display. However, the competition is between China and the rest of the world. Chinese brands, including BYD, Deepal, Skywell, Dongfeng, Omoda, Neta, MG, and Great Wall, feature at the six-day NADA Auto Show 2024 expo. As competition has heated, dealers have enticed people with small profit margins and announced newer, cheaper models and promotions.EVs dominate the NADA auto show, said Anup Baral, coordinator of the event. He noted that 24 four-wheeler brands, 19 two-wheelers, and 12 light commercial vehicles will participate in the fair.The auto show offers a four-wheeler for a price starting at Rs1.7 million.“All the 23 four-wheeler brands and 19 two-wheeler brands unveiled new models and variants on the first day of the auto show,” Baral said. Chandra Prasad Dakal, president of the Federation of Nepalese Chambers of Commerce and Industry, said Nepal still lacks sufficient infrastructure for EVs. “It can be both charging stations and roads, which are crucial.” Speaking at the opening ceremony, dealers said automobiles should not be considered a luxury sector. They said it needs to be considered in terms of the economy and sources of revenue.The private sector also raised concerns as spare parts, the million-dollar business, were happening through illegal channels.The auto show has around 120 stalls of two-wheelers and four-wheelers, including commercial vehicles, financial institutions, lubricants, batteries, and spare parts.Nepal’s booming EV market saw a 149 percent increase in imports in the last fiscal year, which ended in mid-July. The country brought in 11,701 EVs worth Rs29.48 billion during this period.Automobile traders said that roughly 85 percent of the passenger vehicle market in Nepal consists of EVs.The crowd has increased since the first day of the auto show.The stalls of two-wheelers, four-wheelers, and light commercial vehicles reported many bookings on the fair's first day.“We received a good number of visitors on the first day of the auto show compared to last year’s,” Baral said.What’s in the show?Hansraj Hulaschand and Co Pvt Ltd launched new two-wheelers, the Speed 400 and Scrambler 400 X. The Speed 400's introductory price is Rs639,900.Bajaj Motorcycles launched the Bajaj Pulsar NS400Z, priced at Rs559,900 in Nepal.Sipradi Trading, the authorised distributor of Tata Motors, launched Punch.ev with a starting price of Rs3.39 million.The authorised distributor of CFMOTO, Rishi Trade Center, launched the CFMOTO 450MT two-wheeler priced at Rs1.24 million. Laxmi E-Mobility, the authorised distributor of Kaiyi, unveiled three models. The starting price is Rs2.29 million.ZEEHO brand electric scooter AE4, distributed by Tishi Trade Center, launched a scooter at Rs299,900.Delta Autocorp, the exclusive distributor and importer of Vespa and the Aprilia scooter brands in Nepal launched the Aprilia Storm 125 BS6 scooter with an introductory price of Rs324,900.MAW Group, the authorised dealer of Yamaha, unveiled its latest adventure bike, the Yamaha WR 155R and MT 15 V2.CG Motors & CG Evolution Pvt Ltd has unveiled three new EV brands: AVATR, X-PENG and Riddara. \nNADA Auto Show 2024, Nepal’s biggest automobile fair, kicks off Tuesday in Kathmandu. Electric vehicle (EV) producers and representatives are here to tap into Nepal’s booming EV market, which saw 149 percent increase in imports in the last fiscal year, which ended in mid-July. The country brought in 11,701 EVs worth Rs29.48 billion during this period. The Post caught up with Balaje Rajan, chief strategy officer and vice president for International Business of Tata Passenger Electric Mobility, who is currently in Nepal to participate in the auto show, to talk about Nepal’s EV market, ongoing competition with Chinese EVs and the company’s future plans. Excerpts: How do you observe the Nepali EV market?Nepal has taken a very progressive stance towards EVs. Roughly 85 percent of the passenger vehicle market here now consists of EVs. It's a significant market for Tata Motors because, as the market leader over the last couple of years, we aim to maintain that spot, and we also believe that our products are perfect for Nepali roads. So, I see Nepal as a very important market. I also see Nepal as one of the benchmark automotive markets in the world where EVs are driving the market.The presence of Chinese EVs in the Nepali market is increasing faster. How do you view the competition? What are your strategies for staying ahead?Chinese EVs compete everywhere in the world, including in India. Despite multiple competitors, we have constantly innovated our products, and continue to retain a significant leadership position of about 70 percent plus market share in our home country, India. So, our products are more fit for the kind of use cases people see in Nepal. Our partnership with Sipradi, which has developed charging stations and vehicle servicing ecosystems in Nepal, will be our edge. The strength of our products, plus our partnership with Sipradi, will enable us to continue our success. Given the differences in terrain and infrastructure between Nepal and India, TATA EV customers complain that the range is not as advertised. How is the company addressing the issue?We have been communicating the real-world use range and product sales at the dealership. We have to differentiate between the certified range because of the certification methodology. There is a certain ideal test condition which, for statutory or regulatory reasons, we must declare in India. So, we are careful to ensure that that reference is not taken as the real-life range in a Nepal-type condition where the terrain is very different. We are giving a real-life range indication at the point of sale through our partner Sipradi, and we will also, with our current launch and going forward, declare the real-life range in our advertisements. So that customers would know exactly what the specific range is.What is the share of TATA EV in the Nepali market? Which models are popular with customers?We have had a tremendous run for about the last twenty months or so, starting with the pro-EV policies coming into effect. We are proud to say that last year, we were the market leaders, and this year as well, we have seen very strong retail growth. We want to regain that spot. When our Nexon was initially launched, followed by Tiago, we had a very good customer response. In the fleet segment, the Express T has a very strong response. We are launching the Punch at the NADA Auto Show, which starts Tuesday, and we expect a strong response. We will continue to bring our new models here, which will continue to be loved by customers. What are your sales expectations for the auto show?We expect that everyone will come and first have a look at the Punch. It’s a unique car that delights Nepali customers because of its high ground clearance. It has a compact footprint but is spacious inside to manoeuvre it on small roads. At the same time, high-ground clearance also allows you to go outside the Valley. I expect people to come to look at it and then test drive and give us the same type of commercial success that we saw with the Tiago last year.If demand for EVs continues to grow, when do you expect EVs to replace petrol and diesel cars in the passenger car segment in Nepal?I think over the medium term, for sure, there would be a significant impact on the import of petrol and diesel cars. It is also the right thing for Nepal, considering the abundant availability of electricity and the fact that oil [fossil fuel] must be imported. I think the government's policy of switching to EVs is very positive and progressive. In the medium term, as you can see today, 83 percent of customers are buying EVs. As more EVs are on the road, you will probably see only certain specialist use cases where petrol and diesel might still be around, and EVs will become mainstream in the overall pool.How do you assess the EV infrastructure in Nepal? What are the areas for improvement?The current charging infrastructure in Nepal, supporting around 5,000-6,000 cars, are located aptly. Through our partner Sipradi, there are charging stations every 150 km, offering a combination of fast and slow chargers. Siradi has the widest and most robust network of EV chargers. I met customers earlier today [Monday], and they were all very optimistic about the existing charging infrastructure in Nepal. Of course, as the market expands, the need for more charging stations will increase, and we plan to add accordingly. More chargers could be added based on customer demand in locations where chargers are already installed. For now, the charging infrastructure is reasonable, and future expansion will depend on the growth of EVs. Do you have any plans to open an assembly unit for EVs in Nepal? Currently, we don’t have any plans, but when it comes to any assembly, it is a combination of two things. One is the demand, and the second is the extent of incentivisation. So first, in terms of demand, Nepal has shown robust EV adoption. If the market grows significantly, it could justify considering setting up local assembly. The second factor is incentives, which are very important because any investment needs to provide a return. As of now, the size of the market and prevailing regulations do not make a strong case for local assembly, but we will continue to monitor the situation. \nOver 3,500 people across the country have been infected with scrub typhus since mid-July, the start of this fiscal year.Officials at the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division say they expect more cases in the coming days as the disease typically peaks in September.“Like in previous years, hundreds of people have also been infected with scrub typhus this year,” said Dr Gokarna Dahal, chief of vector Control Section at the division. “More people can get infected in the coming days, as the peak season is still ahead.”Scrub typhus, or bush typhus, is an infectious disease caused by the parasite Orientia tsutsugamushi, a mite-borne bacterium. It spreads in humans when bitten by infected chiggers (larval mites) found in mice.Until a few years ago, it was believed that people residing in rural areas or those working in grasslands or fields were at high risk. However, urban populations are also now being affected by the disease.“Over 100 people from Hetauda Sub-metropolitan city have been infected from Scrub typhus this year,” said Krishna Bahadur Major, chief of the Health Office, Makawanpur. “Although more cases are reported in villages, urban areas are not immune, with several positive cases emerging there as well.”Doctors point out high fever, headache, abdominal pain, backache, joint and muscle pain, red rash, nausea and vomiting as some of the symptoms of scrub typhus infection. Patients with severe illness may develop bleeding which could lead to organ failure. The infection can lead to respiratory distress, inflation of brain, lungs, kidney failure and then multi-organ failure. If not treated immediately, it could be fatal.Nepal saw a surge in scrub typhus cases after the calamitous 2015 earthquakes that killed nearly 9,000 persons across the country.Three months after the quakes, the BP Koirala Institute of Health Sciences, Dharan, alerted the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division about six children with unusual fevers and severe respiratory problems.Serum samples were collected for subsequent tests in Kathmandu and Bangkok, which confirmed a scrub typhus outbreak. By then, four children had already died in the course of the treatment. By the end of the year, 101 cases were confirmed in 16 districts, and four more people succumbed to the disease.The magnitude of the outbreak escalated in 2016 when 831 cases of scrub typhus were reported in 47 districts, and 14 people died by the end of that year.According to the Ministry of Health and Population data, more than 1,026 people were infected with the disease in 2020. Their number increased to 1,999 in 2021, and it rose to more than 2,900 in 2022.In 2023, over 5,000 people were infected with the deadly disease. Doctors say the risk of severity and fatality can be minimised if the patients are diagnosed and treated early, they say.Ordinary antibiotics, such as doxycycline and azithromycin, which are on the essential drugs list supplied by the government to health facilities across the country for free distribution, can cure the disease.However, what is concerning is that many health workers, including doctors, lack sufficient knowledge about diagnosing scrub typhus. Many health facilities also lack reagents to carry out tests for the disease.Doctors can diagnose the disease based on the symptoms, but the risk of misdiagnosis is high, as scrub typhus symptoms are similar to those of other illnesses. They warn that waiting for lab results before starting treatment could be dangerous. It can take about a week to get lab results, and by that time, if the patient is not treated can fall into a coma and suffer multi-organ failure. \nSeriously ill patients at District Hospital Sankhuwasabha are squeezed into every available space besides the beds: corridors, the floor, chairs, and even the storeroom, and outside on the hospital compound.With the spike in new cases of water-borne, viral fever and vector-borne diseases, mostly dengue, the hospital is struggling to cope.“Every day, around two dozen seriously ill patients end up sleeping on the corridor floor and in other areas,” Dr Pranam Jayaru, medical superintendent at the district hospital, told the Post over the phone from Khandbari, the district headquarters. “Our health workers have been working overtime to provide care, but we lack even the most basic supplies like IV stands. Patients’ visitors have to hold the IV bags or we have to improvise by tying them to windows.”This situation is becoming increasingly common in hospitals in many districts, which are seeing a spike in patient numbers amid a massive dengue outbreak. The virus has spread to 75 of the country’s 77 districts, killing at least three people and infecting 5,119 others since January. Two mountain districts—Humla and Mustang—have yet to record dengue cases this year. “For the last three years, we have witnessed a dengue epidemic during the monsoon season,” said Jayaru. “We can only request our staff to serve extra hours, but cannot provide equipment or expand bed numbers.”Doctors say most patients do not want to be referred to other places, as reaching Dharan, the nearest city, in an ambulance takes over six hours. Holding seriously ill patients in ill-equipped hospitals is risky as they lack consultant doctors, blood transfusion services, and high-tech laboratories, among other things.Experts say the deadly virus outbreak in most mountain districts and all hill districts shows the impact of climate change on Nepal’s healthcare system. Despite these challenges, no effective mitigation measures have been adopted.Many hospitals are overwhelmed by the influx of patients, and health workers are forced to place seriously ill patients in corridors and other makeshift spaces, compromising patient safety.“Our health facilities are not equipped to endure the climate crisis,” said Dr Meghnath Dhimal, chief researcher at the Nepal Health Research Council. “Many are built on hilltops or riverbanks, both vulnerable to climate impacts. These health facilities are also unprepared for emerging problems and spiking patient flow.”Of the 5,119 cases of the dengue cases reported, only 77 cases are from Madhesh Province, which is traditionally an endemic area. Health Ministry officials admit that the disease is shifting towards hills and mountain regions due to climate change. They say other factors, such as increased mobility and improved transportation, are also contributing to the spread of the disease to new areas. “Yes, new challenges have increased in areas previously considered less risky, but we have not strengthened our health facilities to deal with the emerging challenges accordingly,” said Dr Gokarna Dahal, chief of the Vector Control Section at the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division. “Our health system is not is not designed to address these evolving risks.”Dengue is a viral disease transmitted by female Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes. According to the World Health Organization, the same vector also transmits chikungunya, yellow fever, and the Zika virus.In 2023, at least 20 persons died, and more than 52,000 were infected by the virus across the country.In 2022, a total of 88 people died, and over 54,000 were infected by the virus. During that period, hospitals in the Kathmandu Valley were overwhelmed with dengue patients, and pharmacies ran out of paracetamol, the most widely used medicine to treat fever.Back in 2019, dengue killed at least six people and more than 16,000 were hospitalised across the country. The virus had spread to 68 districts at the time.Dengue has become a year-round threat in Nepal over the past few years with cases consistently rising each year.Epidemiologists as well as virologists now consider the dengue virus as a major public health problem in Nepal. They also say that despite thousands of persons getting infected and scores dying from the disease, the authorities have not taken the situation seriously. The lackadaisical approach, they believe, is contributing to the spread of the virus. They call for implementing measures such as search-and-destroy drives and awareness campaigns to control dengue vectors.A report by the United Nations titled “Climate Change 2022: Impacts, Adaptation and Vulnerability” states that at least six major vector-borne diseases have recently emerged in Nepal and are now considered endemic, with climate change implicated as the primary driver.The report also showed increasing evidence that climate change has extended the elevational distribution of Anopheles, Culex and Aedes mosquitoes, which carry viruses to above 2,000 metres in Nepal.Dengue-transmitting mosquitoes breed in clean water and bite people in daylight. Uncovered water tanks and other discarded objects such as plastic cups and bottles could be breeding grounds for the dengue-carrying mosquitoes.Symptoms of dengue include mild to high fever, severe muscle pain, rashes, severe headache and pain in the eyes, doctors say. Patients with these symptoms are advised to seek immediate treatment. While there is no specific cure for the disease, early detection and access to proper medical care can prevent death. \nIn a bid to monitor the nutrition status of the population, the Ministry of Health and Population is planning to carry out a nutrition assessment survey in all districts throughout the country in the ongoing fiscal year.Officials said the nutrition status of pregnant women, children under five, adolescents, and new mothers will be monitored during the survey.“We will first assess the nutrition condition of the people of specific age groups and then share the findings with relevant agencies, including the Ministry of Health and Population,” said Lila Bikram Thapa, chief of the Nutrition Section at the Family Welfare Division under the Department of Health Services. “The nutrition assessment survey is crucial for getting the latest picture of the nutrition status of the population.”Malnutrition is a silent crisis in Nepal. The country has made significant progress in reducing stunting among children under five. According to the Nepal Demographic and Health Survey-2022 report, stunting decreased from 57 percent in 2001 to 25 percent in 2022.Wasting, a debilitating disease that causes muscle and fat tissues to waste away among children under five, decreased from 11 percent in 2001 to eight percent in 2022.Wasting or low weight for one’s height in children, if not treated properly and on time, is associated with a higher mortality risk, according to the World Health Organisation.Even though the health survey report showed some improvement in the country’s overall nutrition status, progress is not the same in all provinces. More than 16 percent of the children under five years in Lumbini Province are found to be suffering from wasting—the most immediate, visible, and life-threatening form of malnutrition.Likewise, around 10 percent of children under the age of five years in Madhesh Province have been found suffering from wasting.Officials said the new study was required to determine the latest progress on the population's nutrition conditions.“The nutrition status of the adolescent population will be monitored by schools, while health facilities will monitor children, pregnant women, and new mothers,” said Thapa. “Health workers will also take classes in schools to educate students about the importance of good nutrition and counsel pregnant women and new mothers at health facilities.”Along with the lack of sufficient nutrient foods, poor sanitation and lack of safe drinking water and treatment are blamed for wasting.Doctors say malnutrition during pregnancy increases the risk of complications and maternal and neonatal deaths, as well as the likelihood of low birth weight. It is a major impediment to growth, affecting human capital and economic productivity of a country.Experts say nutrition is directly linked to the country's overall development. Malnutrition affects children's physical and mental growth, which ultimately affects the country’s economic health.It weakens intellectual capacity, limits productivity in adulthood, and increases vulnerability to certain diseases.Nutritionists ask authorities to promote locally available foods, educate people about the importance of a nutritious diet, and provide fortified flour to improve nutritional conditions and reduce dependency on freely distributed foods.Nepal also has an international obligation to improve the condition of malnourished children.To meet the SDG targets, the country needs to reduce stunting to 15 percent from the current 32 percent by 2030, wasting to four percent from the current eight percent, underweight condition to 10 percent from the existing 19 percent, and anaemia to 10 percent from more than 43 percent at present.The SDGs, a follow-up on the Millennium Development Goals, (MDGs), aim to end poverty, hunger, and all forms of inequality worldwide by 2030, and Nepal has committed to meeting the goals. \nLast week, doctors at Thapathali-based Paropakar Maternity and Women’s Hospital diagnosed a new mother in her late 20s with postnatal depression. Her newborn baby was admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit of the hospital due to health complications, and the mother was under care in the maternity ward.“We had to start her on anti-depressants, as she was showing serious symptoms, including suicidal thoughts,” said Dr Pratikshya Ghimire, a psychiatrist at the hospital. “She felt sad all the time, worried about the newborn's future, and had lost her appetite.” Mental health problems during pregnancy are the second leading cause of maternal deaths, after excessive bleeding during childbirth, also known as postpartum haemorrhage, and pre-eclampsia [pregnancy-related high blood pressure disorders. A report on maternal mortality unveiled last year by the National Statistics Office showed that six percent of maternal deaths were due to self-harm (suicide), with most cases occurring during pregnancy.To address mental health problems during pregnancy, the Ministry of Health and Population has started outpatient care services at the Maternity Hospital.“We have not only started outpatient care but also begun screening inpatients for mental health conditions,” said Dr Ghimire. “We have diagnosed around a dozen and a half patients with serious mental health problems.”According to Dr Ghimire, the woman had an inter-caste marriage, and neither her in-laws nor her own parents accepted her marriage, contributing to her mental health struggles. Several other pregnant women and new mothers have also been found suffering from mental health problems, each at various stages of severity.“The Health Ministry had deputed one psychiatric doctor to our hospital, and we started offering outpatient services after her arrival,” said Dr Shree Prasad Adhikari, the hospital's director. “We are also working on training all hospital staff in mental health screening so that conditions can be diagnosed early. Once mental health problems are identified, patients can be referred to specialists.”Officials hope that screening pregnant women for mental health problems and providing prompt treatment will help reduce maternal deaths, which have been rising alarmingly of late.Doctors say prenatal and postnatal depression can occur at any time during pregnancy or after childbirth. Shifts in hormone levels during pregnancy and after childbirth can significantly affect mood. Many women feel anxious about changes happening to their bodies. Some may even have financial concerns and some worry about taking on new and additional responsibilities.Some women experience extreme sadness, anxiety, fatigue, and changes in sleeping and eating habits during pregnancy or after childbirth. Experts warn that prenatal and postnatal depression along with anxiety and other mental health issues, can lead some women to take their own lives.They also emphasise that excessive bleeding after childbirth, also known as postpartum haemorrhage, pre-eclampsia (pregnancy-related high blood pressure disorders), and suicide are preventable. “Timely screening for mental health problems and proper counselling can significantly reduce the mental health problems faced by pregnant women and new mothers,” said Adhikari. “We have launched this initiative at our hospital, and this is something other hospitals should also implement.”Nepal reduced the maternal mortality rate from 539 per 100,000 births in 1996 to 239 per 100,000 births in 2016. For this, the country also received a Millennium Development Goals award. The 2021 census report showed that in every 100,000 live births, 151 women died from maternity-related complications. According to the report, 88 maternal deaths were prevented in every 100,000 live births between 2016 and 2021. Nepal’s target under the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals is to reduce the maternal mortality rate to 75 per 100,000 births by 2030. \nA World Health Organization official stressed on Tuesday that mpox, regardless of whether it is the new or old strain, is not the new Covid, as authorities know how to control its spread.“We can and must tackle mpox together,” said Hans Kluge, WHO regional director for Europe, in a UN media briefing.“So will we choose to put the systems in place to control and eliminate mpox globally? Or we will enter another cycle of panic and neglect? How we respond now and in the years to come will prove a critical test for Europe and the world,” he added.Mpox, a viral infection that causes pus-filled lesions and flu-like symptoms, is usually mild but can kill.The clade 1b variety has caused global concern because it seems to spread more easily through routine close contact.A case of the variant was confirmed last week in Sweden and linked to a growing outbreak in Africa, the first sign of its spread outside the continent. The WHO declared the recent outbreak of the disease a public health emergency of international concern after the new variant was identified.Kluge said that the focus on the new clade 1 strain will also help in the fight against the less severe clade 2 variety that has spreading globally since 2022, allowing Europe to improve its response through better health advice and surveillance.About 100 new cases of the clade 2 mpox strain are now being reported in the European region every month, added Kluge.Mpox transmits through close physical contact, including sexual contact, but unlike previous global pandemics such as Covid-19, there is no evidence it spreads easily through the air.Health authorities need to be on alert and flexible in case there are new, more transmissible clades or ones that change their transmission route, but there are no recommendations for people to wear masks, said WHO spokesperson Tarik Jasarevic. \nDusit Princess Kathmandu hosts a five-day trout festival featuring a menu of locally sourced trout dishes crafted by Chef Mondal and his team.\nA 10-year-old's enthusiasm for baking, fueled by televised cooking shows, inspires a journey of culinary self-discovery, highlighting the technicalities, challenges, and transformative power of home baking.\nThe Stonewall Riots of 1969 ignited the LGBTQIA+ rights movement, leading to the establishment of Inclusive Galaxy Restaurant in Kathmandu, a safe space for the queer community to gather, find support, and foster a sense of belonging and individuality.\nAditya Mishra, a Nepali chef in New York, is elevating Nepali cuisine through his restaurant 'The Sewing Tin', showcasing dishes like kachaila and lamb sekuwa, and aspiring to spread Nepali food globally.\nCeleus Baral, a young environment science student, runs an online baking shop, Bakeleus, where she creates unique baked goods using her background in environmental science and her passion for nature.\nKathmandu Valley's bustling city juxtaposes with the tranquil village of Khokana, renowned for its medieval streets, Sikali Temple, historical town, and traditional mustard oil mills.\n“How much oxygen do you have for the summit?”I think this is the kind of question a film producer would ask. But when you're on the mountain, the answer is never clear.I have worked for a long time in the film industry and different art areas, especially photography and engraving.Working in various fields and drawing inspiration from them has become a new normal for me. I have made this approach my way of life without even realising it.I took responsibility for producing the last movie I worked on and shot the behind-the-scenes footage for a documentary. By doing so, I witnessed the entire shooting process and the journey of a movie.In the snowy highlands of Turkey, we had to endure the consequences of the changing climate to shoot ‘About Dry Grasses’, directed by Nuri Bilge Ceylan. The highlands used to be snowy in January, but by the time we got there in the same month, there was no snow. Nature was changing. It was responding to what was happening—to what humanity had done to it. In the end, it snowed, and we shot the intense snow scenes we wanted. But since most of our days were sunny, unlike what the director wanted, we had to shoot in the sunset and sunrise hours. As crew members, we spent many days waiting for the sun to set.Production requires creating opportunities, finding solutions, and being creative for a work of art to come true. For this, patience, endurance, calmness, and timing are necessary. On the other hand, nature wanted us to listen to it and wait for the right time.During that time, I witnessed many of nature's lessons. For example, I experienced extreme cold for the first time. We endured temperatures ranging from -33 degrees to +55 degrees. By listening to nature, surrendering to its forces, and working within its limits, we managed to persevere.No matter how much you prepare or plan during the pre-production phase, if you are working in nature, remember that nature will always have the final say.The film was completed, released, and connected with audiences. Its success at Cannes 2023 was followed by my trip to the North Pole for my project. I returned with a mix of wonderful developments, joys, and challenges. During this process, I experienced life and death, happiness and sadness, losses and awards.I realised the value of being able to breathe comfortably a few days after my father's chemotherapy ended. Just a few days earlier, he had said, \"Well done, my daughter. I'm glad you went!\" All the anxiety and hard work, filled with fears at the beginning, were finally behind me.Before going to Everest, when I was on the verge of giving up, defeated by my fears, I remembered my father's words. Everest reminded me of what he said while struggling to breathe, adding a turning point to my life.What does it mean to say ‘life’s turning point?’ How many turning points can there be in life?Who am I, and what am I doing in this world? How well do I know my own limits? Can I find answers to these big questions? These thoughts sparked my dream of journeying to Everest. Now, after returning, I can say that it turned my life around.“How much oxygen do you need for the summit?” sounds more like “How much do you need to hold on to life?” How many reasons do you find that give meaning to your life, keep you alive, and allow you to breathe? How much can you endure in the face of obstacles, and can you keep believing that a solution will eventually come your way?Can these questions be separated from the idea of measuring and assessing something, from learning its quantity and financial value? Can everything be known with certainty? Should the journey be fully understood in advance, with all its promises laid out? Should it be viewed like a purchase with a price tag, asking, “Is this journey worth this much?”I had never trekked before and had no climbing experience. I had lived at sea level my entire life and had never been to a high altitude.However, this journey was not only about the physical climb but also an inner discovery. After losing my father to lung cancer, his breathing difficulties taught me the fragility of breath, life, and existence. I also mentally prepared myself for the physical challenges I might face. Despite all my concerns, could this journey help me understand the cycle of life and the resilience of the soul?So, how could I make this trek possible? How could I land in Nepal? Despite all the economic difficulties and the many things I felt needed organising, I did my best and believed in it.Since I was embarking on this journey, I felt I should share about my travels and inspire others.Starting with photography, cinema, and engraving, which are already integral parts of my life, I dreamed of documenting and sharing the inspiring aspects of this journey.After months of correspondence and dreaming, it all came true. Finally, I embarked on the journey with the goal of creating photographs, engravings, and documentaries. I learned a great deal from my travels in Nepal, from the people I met, and from every moments I witnessed. I felt incredibly fortunate to have been able to honour my father’s memory with the peace and serenity I experienced in the Himalayas.During my 15-day journey to Everest Base Camp, I encountered nature’s masterpieces at every turn. As concerns like “How will I endure?” and “How will I finish?” started to weigh on me, the mountains suddenly parted with the clouds and gazed down at me.It was amazing to witness the appearance of ‘Gods’ that I had never seen before, in such immense size and in such a close, awe-inspiring manner beside me during that silent walk.As someone who came from one of the most crowded cities in the world, Istanbul, while I struggled with my daily questions and uncertainties, trying to control everything, they stood there calmly, as if answering me.They were just there—before and after.My guide, Lakhpa Sherpa, always reminded me not to worry about how high we were, how long it would take to reach our accommodation, or what the weather would be like. He encouraged me to live in the moment, and he was right.He advised me to focus on my breathing, not to get thirsty, to eat enough, and to appreciate the extraordinary beauty of the journey. In the mountains, plans dissolve and each moment is embraced as it comes.All the good wishes, prayers, and everything encountered along the way were for the journey itself. The mountain was full of life, secrets, and everything I had wondered about.This 15-day journey to Everest Base Camp was a solo adventure, yet I wouldn't have been able to complete it without my guide, Lhakpa, and my porter. Additionally, I was fortunate enough to experience the hospitality, generosity, and honesty at Trekkers Paradise, which organised the entire journey and provided guidance.I witnessed how dedication and sincerity are crucial in completing a journey safely and healthily. Ghanshyam Sharma, from Trekkers Paradise and Sauraj Jhingan, a climber who summited the Everest in 2018, shared their experiences with me during the journey.They experienced the 2015 earthquake while they were at the Everest Base Camp.As a filmmaker, their role as actors, and attention to detail played a significant role in bringing my dream photography and documentary project to life.The sponsors of my journey were Turkish Airlines, The North Face, Apple, Canon, and Stanley. My supporters include Oscar International College and Nepal Film Campus. Throughout the journey, I shared many experiences, memories, and countless photos and images with my students.On my way back home after 21 days, I celebrated my birthday on the plane. From the right window, the Himalayas bid me farewell. I felt like I had opened a new chapter in my life, and I was certain that I would return.I had made many friends and memories in Nepal.For now, I will be working on a documentary and preparing for a photography and engraving exhibition titled ‘My Soul Beyond the Mountain’.To the Himalayas: This summer was spent with you, but we will meet again soon. \nWe spent five days in Sri Lanka two weeks ago, driving up and down the island, covering almost 70 percent of its territory. Our tour spanned over 1,000 kilometres, including hills, beach spots, and heritage and religious sites.Our first stop in Sri Lanka was Colombo’s Bandaranaike International Airport. We were greeted by a warm and humid breeze when we exited the airport. The host briefed us (a group of journalists) that heavy rainfall has affected areas across Sri Lanka since mid-May 2024. Rain and storms intensified on June 1, with the most significant effects in the south and west of the country. We were lucky to have no rain in the forecast.On the first night, we checked into the lavish Jetwing Lake resort, an opulent sanctuary amidst the lush landscape. The resort’s expansive grounds were a retreat, offering a glimpse of Sri Lanka's natural beauty. We feasted on delicious cuisine, every bite exploding with flavour, introducing us to the island’s famed culinary delights. On June 7, early morning, the sun shone brightly, previewing the promise of an incredible journey ahead. We set off early the following day, eager to explore the mysteries of this enchanting island. As we ventured further into the heart of Sri Lanka, the landscape revealed its majestic nature. We were astounded by seeing Pidurangala Rock, a 200-metre-high granite colossus just a kilometre north of Sigiriya. The short hike to Pidurangala Rock offered breathtaking views of Sigiriya and beyond. We climbed the steep steps and soon were rewarded with a breathtaking panoramic view of the surrounding landscape. It took us 30 minutes to climb. The sight took our breaths away and left us humbled in the presence of such grandeur. From the top are glorious vistas of the surrounding landscape and an incredible view of the majestic Sigiriya Rock. From there, Sigiriya Lion’s Rock is visible, standing alone. This was the place where demon king Ravana had his palace in the Treta Yuga. Believed to have been built 50 centuries ago, the palace is said to have had a unique lift for Ravana and his visitors. Ravana imprisoned Sita in one of the caves at the bottom of this humongous boulder. Sigiriya is a fifth-century fortress in Sri Lanka carved out of an inselberg, a hill of hard volcanic rock that soared high above the surrounding jungle. We spent two hours atop the rock, mainly taking photographs. We descended from Pidurangala Rock, filled with awe and a sense of accomplishment.The journey ahead seemed even more enticing as we ventured along the winding roads, heading towards our next destination.Cash-strapped Sri Lanka plunged into its worst financial crisis in more than seven decades in 2022, with a severe dollar shortage sending inflation soaring to a high of 70 percent, its currency to record lows, and its economy contracting 7.3 percent.Thanks to the growing number of tourists, Sri Lanka is now bouncing back.In Jetwing Lake, we met Kasun Pradeep Somasiri, a receptionist. He briefed us that the resort is now 50 percent occupied. “That’s a better figure now as we are recovering.”The travel and tourism sector is a significant income generator for Sri Lanka. However, the economic crisis, the Ukraine–Russia war, and China’s zero-Covid policy have jeopardised the industry.Tourism accounted for more than 12 percent of the country’s GDP in 2019 and was the third-largest source of foreign exchange reserves, behind worker remittances and the apparel industry.Sri Lanka was poised to be one of the world’s best holiday destinations due to its rich culture, wealth of natural resources, and diversity of accessible experiences.However, tourism-dependent Sri Lanka suffered its first major setback with the Easter bombings 2019. This led to the collapse of inbound tourism flows as international arrivals declined by 18 percent year-on-year, and tourist expenditure fell by 17.7 percent that year. This was immediately followed by two years of pandemic restrictions. Inbound visitors fell to just 116,600 in 2021.An acute balance of payments crisis forced Sri Lanka to preemptively default on foreign debt of over $50 billion in April 2022, triggering a crippling economic contraction with spiralling inflation.“Tourism is gaining momentum,” says Somasiri. “The British and Chinese have started to return to Sri Lanka.”January-August is the peak season for foreigners. “From December to April, local people travel for holiday purposes,” says Somasiri. Before we started the tour to other religious sites, our tour guide, Sampath Mayadunne, told us, “Don't take selfies with your back to Buddha.” Turning your back on a Buddha statue and some other religious sites to take photos and videos is a strict no-no.The most common sight across Sri Lanka is the tank cascades system, an ancient irrigation infrastructure. The system is a network of small tanks draining to large reservoirs that store rainwater and surface runoff for later use.“These infrastructures were built by its ancient kings over 2,000 years ago to solve the water scarcity in the country’s dry zone,” says Mayadunne.On day two, we travelled to Ranweli Spice Garden in Matale. This garden is famous for its rare spices and herbs. A tour of the gardens will show you the cultivation, harvesting, cleaning, and packaging process, as well as the health benefits and uses of the herbs.On the way, we saw a colourful Muthumariamman Hindu temple, boasting hundreds of detailed sculptures in a rich mosaic of colour.In Kandy, we visited the Temple of the Tooth Relic (Sri Dalada Maligawa), one of the most sacred places of worship in the Buddhist world. It was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1988.The temple sustained damage from bombings by Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna in 1989 and by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam in 1998. However, it was fully restored each time.We then headed to Jetwing St Andrew’s, a luxurious 5-star property in Sri Lanka’s hill country of Nuwara Eliya, situated at 1,900 metres above sea level. During our stay in Kandy, we immersed ourselves in the city's charm and the serenity of the countryside. On the third day, early morning, we travelled to Nuwara Eliya, the area famous for tea estates that give many Nepalis the feeling that they have come to Kanyam, Ilam, in eastern Nepal.We visited a tea factory called Damro Labookellie Tea Centre, the oldest tea centre in Sri Lanka. Due to its cold climate, it is the most important area for tea production in Sri Lanka.In this tea factory, they make white and black tea, while the green tea is processed in another tea factory and then sent to Damro.After the tea factory tour and the tea tasting, we headed to Galle, our next resting point.We encountered narrow, winding, and maze-like streets and alleys in Nuwara Eliya, known as ‘Little England’. The town has preserved almost all its British-era buildings and is calm and beautiful. On our way to Galle, at the roadside, our tour guide stopped us at the famed Sita temple, which has Hanuman's footprints and is the place where Sita, wife of Lord Rama, was held captive by the demon king Ravana after he abducted her from India.We were at Sita Eliya, a temple named Sri Seethai Amman.When we reached the Hindu temple, rich in vibrant colours and architectural elements, it was full of devotees. The water stream adjoining the temple is believed to be where Sita bathed. Large footprints are found on the stones in the stream, and there is a saying that those belong to Hanuman, who came spying to find Sita’s whereabouts.In Ella, Ravana’s waterfalls are significant in the Rama-Ravana story. The cascade charms visitors from all over the globe. The waterfall is easily accessible and is known to have hidden caves at the top, which are believed to have been used as Ravana's residence.The 25-metre-tall waterfall is a beautiful cascade that provides the perfect backdrop for a photo to remember your Ramayana trail adventures in Sri Lanka. A short pilgrimage tour ended there, and it was now time for an adventure. Though it was not part of our itinerary, our guide decided to tour us on a train ride.Though short, only six kilometres from Ella to Demodera, it was thrilling. Everyone screamed in unison like kids on a fair ride to hear the echoes in the dark every time we passed through the tunnels. The sound of the train is subtly different inside a tunnel. For the first-timer, the darkness and shouts inside the tunnels when the train passes would be scary, like a horror movie.The train we boarded wasn’t crowded, but people had already filled the doorway, ready for the scenic journey.With the shrill sound of a whistle, the train slowly pulled away from the platform at Ella, passing houses, coconut trees and green fields.As the train progressed, tourists and locals were leaning out the windows and crowding to hang out the doors. I joined the crowd and hung out on a train. A short excitement ended there.After lunch, we headed to Galle and reached Jetwing Lighthouse. As soon as our group entered the hotel, they shouted with excitement.The hotel is on a rocky outcrop three miles west of Galle. Waves crash over giant boulders in front of it and produce howling winds.We were at Galle’s 17th-century fort five minutes from the hotel on day four. In the Bay of Galle on the southwest coast of Sri Lanka, Galle Fort was built first in 1588 by the Portuguese and lavishly rebuilt by the Dutch during the 17th century. It is a historical, archaeological and architectural heritage monument that maintains a perfect appearance even after more than 436 years.We then reached Hikkaduwa Beach, a popular beach destination on the southern coast of Sri Lanka. On the way, we saw a 30-metre-high Big Buddha Statue. It is a replica of the 6th-century Buddhas of Bamiyan destroyed by the Taliban in Afghanistan. It was created using the earliest known sketches of the statue. It was built in remembrance of the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami victims.We then travelled through the 222-kilometre-long Southern Expressway, Sri Lanka's first expressway linking the capital, Colombo, with Galle, Matara, and Hambantota, significant cities south of the island.On day five, we reached Colombo, the capital of Sri Lanka. Jetwing Colombo Seven hosted us in the bustling capital. We took a city tour early morning and visited Bally's Casino at night.On day six, we returned to Kathmandu early in the morning on a Sri Lankan Airlines flight, the airline that organised the trip in coordination with Jetwing Hotels Limited, a Sri Lankan hotel chain.National flag carrier Nepal Airlines, in its previous avatar as Royal Nepal Airlines, used to operate direct flights to Colombo during the 1980s. However, the carrier suspended operations following an armed movement by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) in Sri Lanka. There had been no direct air links between the two countries for decades.In 2016, Himalaya Airlines started a chartered flight that lasted a few months due to low traffic movement between the two countries. Sri Lankan Airlines started operating direct flights to Kathmandu in August 2021.“The main objective of this media tour is to increase tourism in both countries for mutual benefit. We want to draw Nepalis for pilgrims and leisure activities,” says Nilina Pathirana, Country Manager at Srilankan Airlines in Nepal.“We have understood that Nepali travellers tend to travel to Bangkok, Vietnam, Malaysia, Dubai, and Maldives. Nepalis have quite minimal knowledge about Sri Lanka and the religious connection between Lanka and Nepal. We want to promote Nepal and Sri Lanka jointly. This will be a win-win business,” added Pathirana.The airline said it currently carries 60 percent of the passengers from Nepal to Sri Lanka and beyond destinations like Tokyo, Sydney, Melbourne, and other Middle Eastern destinations. The return airfare for a 3.5-hour-long flight starts at Rs74,000. “We have a four-night, five-day package that begins from Rs80,000, depending on the properties and extended itineraries,” says Pathirana.Nepalis must submit certain required documents for visa processing, like their passport copy and bank statement. Due to this government-to-government policy, only Nepalis must obtain a prior visa. Otherwise, Sri Lankans are required to have a visa upon arrival.“The other best thing is that Sri Lankan Airlines can be involved with the visa process or facilitate the Nepalis tourists. Our main intention is to have a sustainable market in Kathmandu and make it a daily flight,” says Pathirana. \nMundhum Trek in Koshi province in the eastern part of Nepal is a new cultural walking trail. It passes through several indigenous ethnic villages and landscapes in Khotang and Bhojpur districts. This trail goes up to an elevation of 4,200 metres to the viewpoint of Silchung Peak and takes one through the settlements of the Kirati people. This route starts from Diktel Bazaar and passes through beautiful settlements like Chakhewa, Rawa Dhap, Salpa Bhanjyang, Silchung and Hanspokhari before ending in Bhojpur. There are some hotels in Diktel but trekkers are advised to carry tents. The trail offers panoramic views of most of the eight-thousanders, including Everest, Lhotse, Makalu, Cho Oyu and Kanchenjunga mountains. The spring season, March through May, is highly recommended for the trek.Janaki Mandir Janaki Mandir at Janakpur in Madhesh province was constructed in 1874 and is a blend of Mughal and local architecture. The temple is a three-storey building and has 60 rooms, making it the largest temple in Nepal. Pilgrims flock here by the thousands to pay homage to Janaki Mandir—Janaki being the other name of Sita, the daughter of King Janak. The temple houses an idol of Sita which was found near Ayodhya, the kingdom of Ram. The marriage anniversary of Lord Ram and Sita is celebrated in Janakpur every year on Vivaha Panchami, which falls in December. In the southwest corner of Janaki Mandir is the Vivaha Mandap, which has been built at the site where the marriage of Ram and Sita is said to have taken place. Another well-known temple in the vicinity is Ram Mandir, which is built in pagoda style and is hence different from the other temples in Janakpur that generally bear resemblance to Mughal architecture. It houses a female statue, said to be of Yogamaya, which has the reputation of being one of the most beautiful images of female forms in Nepal. Other holy sites of interest include the Laxman Temple, Sankat Mochan Temple and Hanuman Temple.Kuri Village, Kalinchok Kuri village, a popular tourist destination around 150 km from Kathmandu, lies at an altitude of 3,842 metres above sea level in Kalinchowk of Dolakha district, in Bagmati province. People visit the place to enjoy the snow during the winter besides the mesmerising landscapes and splendid panoramic view of the Himalayan range. Kalinchok gets snow mainly at the end of December and the snowfall continues till the end of February or mid-March. When there is snow, it is difficult for jeeps, buses and cars to reach the top of Kuri village. Chains are wrapped around the wheels of vehicles and specially modified jeeps with highly experienced drivers are used to carry visitors. There are several hotels and restaurants in the area. The road up to Kuri has also improved over the years.Annapurna Base Camp Annapurna Base Camp trek, in Gandaki province, makes for a picturesque journey that takes you to the foothills of the Annapurna South, up to 4,130 metres above sea level. The five-day trek (seven days for slow walkers) offers rich cultural diversities, typical Nepali villages and the flora and fauna nestled at the foothills of Annapurna. The distance from Pokhara to Annapurna Base Camp is approximately 81 kilometres. It is among the shortest and most budget-friendly treks in Nepal. For Nepalis, lodging costs around $5 to $10 per day. For foreigners, the overall cost of the trek ranges from $800 to $1500 on average per person. Annapurna Base Camp trek can be done at any time throughout the year as each season offers a different trekking experience. The ideal time for the trek depends on your weather preferences and what you expect from it. However, autumn (September to October) and spring (March to May) are considered the two best seasons for the trek, as the days at the time are warm and bright with clear skies.Bardiya National Park Bardiya National Park, located in the southern Tarai belt of Lumbini province, is home to one of the most elusive and majestic animals on earth—the Royal Bengal Tiger. The park, which covers an area of 968 square kilometres, is considered one of the most important protected areas in the country. It is a prime destination for those looking to catch a glimpse of a tiger. A bit of luck and patience will offer a good chance to see the Bengal Tiger. The jungle safari also offers one the opportunity to spot Asian elephants and the greater one-horned rhinoceros. The rare Gangetic river dolphins are occasionally spotted on rafting trips along the Geruwa River, the eastern channel of the Karnali river. Besides, visitors can enjoy the homestays and explore local Tharu culture. The right time to visit the park is from mid-September to mid-December and mid-February to May.Khaptad National Park Khaptad National Park in Sudurpaschim province is a protected area in the far western region. It stretches over four districts of Bajhang, Bajura, Achham and Doti and ranges in elevation from 1,400 to 3,300 metres. The park can be visited throughout the year. Trekkers are advised to bring their tents, food and other supplies. The Nepal Tourism Board says of late, social media has been increasingly influencing Nepali travellers to go to Khaptad. Since the far-flung Khaptad National Park is still offbeat for many travellers, the area remains pristine and fresh. The seasons of spring (March-May) and autumn (October-November) are the ideal times to visit the park. The temperature ranges from 10°c to 20°c offering pleasant trekking weather. The monsoon begins in June and lasts until September and during this time, roads often become muddy and slippery. From December to February, winter brings snow and chilling winds to the park.Limi Valley \nOnce again, my heart swelled with joy when my hometown came into view.Arriving at Lalikharka after the treacherous journey through Pauwa Bhanjyang and the bustling Kanchhi Dokan, Phidim, the headquarters of Panchthar district, revealed itself like a surprise gift. My home town, Phidim, is unique in the fact that it reveals to travellers approaching it from uphill. As the vehicle descends the mountain road, it slowly comes into view, its houses and buildings recognisable for the native son.This Dashain, I undertook the much-awaited trip to my hometown with my wife Kabita and daughter Aarohi. Little did I anticipate the transformation that awaited me.The moment I got out of the jeep, I noticed that Phidim, nestled in the lush hills, has undergone a remarkable transformation over the years. As I guided my family to my home, which had suffered damages in the 1989 quake that struck eastern Nepal, I found that old, mud and stone houses had been replaced by concrete buildings. The place was vastly different from the one I remembered.Arriving at my childhood home felt like reuniting with an old friend. Navigating its nooks and crannies with my daughter, we delved into the history of the house, a symbol of my cherished memories.My wife had visited Phidim years ago, spending a month with my parents. She, too, recalled beautiful moments she had had in the town. I asked the tenant about the neighbours and acquaintances. Some had died, while others had left for good.A call to local journalist Giriraj Banskota led me to the school grounds, where memories flooded back. This was where I spent my teenage years, playing ball, learning to kick, and watching major tournaments. Here, I even encountered a group of Western climbers headed to Kanchenjunga, the world’s third-highest mountain. I remember being awed by their shiny yellow tents, headlights and strange smell. I remember practising my tutephuteko Angrezi with the climbers. Birendra Shield, an annual sports tournament named after the late king, brought ace players from various schools in Panchthar district. The district also hosted Yuba Mela, an annual three-day fair to commemorate the birthday of the king, organising football tournaments in which teams from as far as Sunsari and Taplejung participated. I never excelled at dribbling balls. A boy growing up in a seven-member family, I soon found my interest in literature. In the late 1980s, Phidim hosted a major literary festival. In the run-up to the 1990 pro-democracy protest, walls were painted with anti-monarchy slogans, local politicians were arrested. I took my family to my school, Naya Namuna Secondary School. It was Saturday, so the school was closed. I peeked through the steel gate and wall, imagining myself labouring over classes. Memories are hazy, but what I remember most is going out of the school—to quiz contests with me leading the school team, to essay competitions at the District Education Office and to play carom board, a national pastime, in a nearby shopfront. Returning to the main street, the demolition of a landmark gate made me reflect on how cities transform, shedding old landmarks for new identities. Navigating narrow alleyways, I felt like a stranger in my own hometown. Multistory buildings have emerged and roads have been paved, reshaping the town. It’s the same place with a different face, leaving me nostalgic for the Phidim of my memories.We finally reached Shivalaya temple, which I told my wife and daughter was one of my cherished hangouts. A giant statue of Falgunanda (the Kirant leader’s birthday is celebrated on November 10) stood before the steps to the temple. Though my wife suspected I came here to smoke, in reality, I visited the temple in the evening to meet friends and talk about issues that mattered most to us at the time. It also offered a panoramic view of the town (I could not take my family to Gadhi Danda, a hillock across the Shivalaya).Towards the end of my journey, I felt sad about Phidim’s lack of prospects. To my dismay, I found that people have been leaving the town in droves. Despite blacktopped roads and multi-story buildings, Phidim faces a troubling reality. The lack of quality higher education and specialist healthcare has driven people away, echoing the circumstances that led me to Kathmandu years ago. Conversations with locals confirmed a mass exodus from the town, a trend that raises concerns about Phidim's future.My conversations with familiar strangers led me to conclude that Phidim has transformed into a transit town for pilgrims heading to Pathibhara Devi Temple, which is around 255 kilometres north in Taplejung district. I met dozens of people headed to the holy site. While pilgrims see it as a stopover, for me, it was a homecoming. The realisation dawned that Phidim is, perhaps, in a state of transition, trading its rustic charm for the hallmarks of urbanisation. While I left Phidim for higher education in Kathmandu, people from rural areas have flocked to the town in search of better opportunities, bringing life and energy to the once quiet community.As we bid adieu to my hometown, I couldn’t help but reflect on the inevitability of leaving a place, no matter how enamoured one is with it. Passing Kanchhi Dokan, I pointed out Kanchnajungha and Kumbhakarna to my daughter—symbols of my childhood. Phidim, now a blend of nostalgia and change, remains etched in my heart, a testament to the intricate dance between memory and evolution. \nBangladesh wrote a new chapter in South Asian football history on Wednesday as they defeated hosts Nepal 4-1 in the final at the ANFA Complex in Lalitpur to win their maiden SAFF U-20 Championship title.Mirajul Islam scored a brace, Rabby Hossen Rahul added the third and Piash Ahmmed Nova rounded off a ruthless victory with their fourth goal as the Bengal Tigers finally got hands on the trophy nine years after the inception of the championship. Nepal and India had shared the titles of the previous five editions, with India winning the last three tournaments in a row. Bangladesh were the finalists in 2017, 2019 and 2022.Backed by home support, and with defending champions India already out of the competition, Nepal started as strong favourites—having also beaten the Tigers 2-1 in the group stage—and were looking to reclaim the throne.But Urjan Shrestha’s side were so wasteful and took too lightly a Bangladeshi team that had undone India in the semi-finals.Nirajan Dhami was the biggest threat to Bangladesh in the first half, constantly bullying the opponents’ post with his long rangers.Md Asif, the shootout hero of India semi-final, started in the place of captain and first choice goalkeeper Mehdi Hasan Srabon, who was out injured, and passed another big test denying Dhami his third goal of the tournament with a finger-tip save thirteen minutes into the game.Nepal’s biggest chance of the match came in the 21st minute when Dhami outmuscled two defenders, bulldozed into the area and cut back for unmarked Abinash Syangtan but the midfielder failed to capitalise on the open chance from near the penalty spot to everyone’s disbelief.Bangladesh then punished Nepal for that miss in the injury time of the first half with a clinical freekick from Mirajul, whose shot from just outside the edge of the box hit the upright before finding the net.The lead injected so much energy into Bangladesh that they were all over Nepal after the restart.Although Nepal pressed for equaliser immediately and Dhami again came close to goal, it was Bangladesh who proved to be a better team with their second goal in the 55th minute thanks to Mirajul, who outsmarted Nepali defenders to head in from goal line after Nepal goalkeeper Jiyarat Shekh misjudged a tight-angled effort from Asadul Molla. Mirajul scored four goals to top the goal-scoring tally in the championship.The two-goal deficit soaked all the life out of Nepal and Bangladesh took full advantage of it, adding another in the 71st minute. Mirajul was the provider as the forward outfoxed three Nepali defenders to set up Rahul to poke home, ending any hopes of Nepali comeback.Samir Tamang gave some hopes of a fight back, reducing the deficit in the 80th minute with a free header after Bangladesh goalie Asif unsuccessfully attempted to punch away Ram Thapa’s cross.Nepal still had time to claw their way back but never rediscovered their composure.Nova then put the final nail in the coffin, sending the ball through the legs of Shekh in the sixth minute of stoppage time after he was set up by Rahul.Mirajul was also declared the most valuable player of the tournament, while Asif won the best goalkeeper award.Nepal received the fair play award.Bangladesh U-20 team coach AKM Maruful Haque, who also coached senior men’s national football team in 2015 during the 2015 SAFF Suzuki Cup, dedicated the trophy to “the heroes and their souls who sacrificed their lives for the sake of new Bangladesh this and last month”.“I hope this championship will inspire the nation to reform Bangladesh,” he added.On the final and the championship, Haque said: “I had told my players to start slow and play simple football because we only had a one-day rest… and because we were playing against a very talented side. We were successful at the end.” \nTen-man Bangladesh progressed into the final of the SAFF U-20 Championship after they defeated defending champions India 4-3 on penalties following a 1-1 draw at the ANFA Complex in Lalitpur on Monday.Bangladesh threw away a first-half lead from Asadul Molla to Rickey Meetei Haobam’s 75th minute equaliser and had to rely on substitute goalkeeper Md Asif’s heroics in the shootout to reach their second consecutive final.The Bengal Tigers now dream of lifting their first ever trophy of the SAFF age-group competition after coming close in 2017, 2019 and 2023.But they will have to overcome a huge challenge from a dogged and spirited Nepal. With India out of the competition, their bid for reclaiming the throne from India has now been made easy.Nepal fought back to beat Bhutan 4-1 on penalties on Sunday after their semi-final battle ended in a 1-1 draw.Only Nepal and India have won the SAFF age-group championship title since its inception in 2015, with the latter winning the last three editions. Nepal won the first two.Nepal will also be full of confidence for the title battle, having beaten Bangladesh 2-1 in the group stage, and will be aiming to reclaim the throne.For Bangladesh, it will be a grudge match, a second chance to take care of an unfinished business and write a new chapter in South Asian football history.The stakes will be high.At Satdobato, India started as favourites and were the first to threaten when Gwgwmsar Goyaray sneaked past the Bangladesh defence and charged at goal with his left-footed strike from close range but goalkeeper and captain Md Mehdi Hasan Srabon came to the rescue with a brilliant save.India kept applying pressure on Bangladesh half but struggled to find any clear chances.Bangladesh were also lacklustre but did not throw away the only chance they got as Molla pounced on a goalkeeping error from Priyansh Dubey to slam from close range—credit to Md Rabby Hossen Rahul who outsmarted Thomas Kanamoottil Cherian to send a low cross that tricked outstretching Dubey before finding the feet of Molla.India had some moments in the final minutes of the first half but could not penetrate the Bangladesh defence line.India switched to a more aggressive mode after the break and it soon started to pay dividends as Bangladesh had to survive a series of attacks.Manglenthang Kipgen curling effort almost found the inside of the net in the 52nd minute.Korou Singh Thingujam should have equalised two minutes later when he only had Srabon to beat but his shot from inside the area flashed wide.Thanglalsoun Gangte then reached twice closer to goal, testing Srabon with a powerful shot and hitting the upright.Bangladesh looked determined not to let their lead slip away easily and made a goal line clearance to deny Goyary in the 64th minute but their first choice goalkeeper Srabon had to be stretchered off after sustaining an injury while trying to foil Goyary’s effort.India took full advantage of it and squared the game in the 75th minute. Naoba Meitei Pangambam utilised the opportunity of a poor defending from Kamacai Marma Aky and cut back for Haobam to send a low ball through the crowded area, giving Asif no chance.Bangladesh received another hammer blow in the fifth minute of added time as Aky was sent off for badly challenging India goalkeeper Dubey.But Asif, who came on crisis and gave away the lead, found redemption in the shootout as he denied Gangte and Akash Tirkey to take Bangladesh into the final. \nNewcastle United’s Anthony Gordon equalised 14 minutes from time to secure a 1-1 draw at Bournemouth in the Premier League on Sunday and spoil their hosts’ 125th anniversary celebrations.Marcus Tavernier put Bournemouth ahead in the first half but Gordon stole in at the back post to steer home a 76th-minute cross from substitute Harvey Barnes to ensure a deserved share of the spoils.Newcastle advanced to four points from their opening two games of the season. Bournemouth drew their first match at Nottingham Forest.Bournemouth, hoping for a win to mark their anniversary festivities, had the ball in the net in stoppage time for what looked initially to be a dramatic late winner but Dango Ouattara’s effort was ruled out for handball after a VAR check.Ouattara rose powerfully but a check showed the ball hit him on the top of his arm as he went up for the header and it was disallowed to the frustration of the home fans.It was Newcastle who looked more likely to snatch a winner, however, with Bournemouth goalkeeper Neto making several key stops to deny Alexander Isak, Joelinton and a header from centre-back Dan Burn in the closing stages.Bournemouth’s lead came after Antoine Semenyo had stolen possession from Joelinton and worked the ball past three defenders before setting up a tap-in for Tavernier.Joelinton was caught midway in his own half by the Bournemouth winger, who looked to have taken on too much as he stormed in at goal but managed to get a square pass to Tavernier when surrounded by three defenders.Semenyo, who struck the crossbar in the first half, was close to another assist in the 64th minute but his pass from the wing was miscued by a sliding Evanilson at the back post.Bournemouth’s record signing was making his debut in one of five changes from last week’s line-up but Evanilson’s two other efforts on goal were easily dealt with by home goalkeeper Nick Pope and he was taken off after 72 minutes.Madueke hits hat-trick as Chelsea thrash Wolves 6-2 Noni Madueke silenced the boos with a second-half hat-trick all assisted by Cole Palmer as Chelsea crushed Wolverhampton Wanderers 6-2 away in a frenetic Premier League clash at Molineux on Sunday.Chelsea’s first Premier League points of the season and the first for new manager Enzo Maresca arrived in spectacular fashion as the visitors ripped Wolves apart after the break following an absorbing first period.Maresca’s side led twice in the first half with goals by Nicolas Jackson and Palmer but both times Wolves deservedly hit back through Matheus Cunha and Jorgen Strand Larsen.Wolves fell apart after the break, however, and Madueke took the game beyond them with three goals in 15 minutes.Joao Felix came off the bench to mark his return to the club with his side’s sixth goal.Much has been made of Chelsea’s huge squad assembled at massive cost and the baffling puzzle Italian Maresca has been hired to solve, but the youthful side he sent out on Sunday including nine players aged 23 or under gelled impressively.Madueke was the villain for the home fans in more ways than one. The English forward was booed from the start after a deleted social media post in which he insulted the city of Wolverhampton.He silenced the hecklers in emphatic fashion, however, to get Chelsea’s league campaign up and running after their opening defeat by champions Manchester City.With Wolves in disarray, Pedro Neto, who left them for Chelsea in the summer, teed up Felix for a cool finish.Slot off to winning start at home as Liverpool cruise past Brentford Arne Slot’s comfortable start to life as Liverpool manager continued when his new side strolled to a 2-0 victory over Brentford in the Premier League on Sunday.Liverpool dominated early on, scoring a fine opening goal on the counterattack when Luis Diaz arrowed his first of the season into the top corner with 13 minutes on the clock.Brentford responded well, going close with two short-range headers either side of halftime, but Mohamed Salah ended the visitors’ hopes of taking anything from their trip to Anfield with a second goal 20 minutes from time.Dutchman Slot now has two 2-0 wins from two games as he undertakes the difficult task of replacing Juergen Klopp as Liverpool boss, with a testing trip to Manchester United up next.“The time with Juergen (was) amazing and the time with the new boss is a joy and he has a certain way of playing,” Liverpool captain Virgil van Dijk told Sky Sports.Before Sunday, no Liverpool boss since Graeme Souness in 1991 had secured wins in their two opening league games in charge.Brentford, without star striker Ivan Toney in the squad again as speculation over his future continues, grew into the contest, but could not make a sustained spell of pressure before halftime count.Liverpool upped the ante after the break and deservedly got their second goal, with Salah adding to his strike on the opening day at Ipswich Town with another well-taken shot to seal the victory.Salah is now Liverpool’s outright fifth top scorer at Anfield in all competitions with 118 goals, moving ahead of Robbie Fowler as he again looks primed to be front and centre of a Red title tilt. \nNepal stormed into the final of the SAFF U-20 Championship after they defeated ten-man Bhutan 4-1 on penalties following a 1-1 draw at the ANFA Complex in Lalitpur on Sunday.Nepal goalkeeper Jiyarat Shekh was the hero of the shootout. He stopped penalties from Jigme Namgyel and Ugyen Dorji and scored the decisive penalty kick, sending Nepal into their third final of the competition.Nepal will face defending champions India or Bangladesh, who meet in the second semi-final clash on Monday, in the title match on Wednesday.The defeat also ended Bhutan’s hopes of reaching their first ever final of the SAFF age-group competition. They reached the semi-finals in 2017, 2019 and 2023.Bhutan were a better side and kept Nepal under pressure most of the first half but could not create any clear chance at goal.Nepal were also lacklustre before the break and could not really threaten the Bhutan post.But the game suddenly burst into life eleven minutes into the second half, when Jetsuen Dorji intercepted a poor pass from Semanta Thapa and launched a thunderstrike from outside the edge of the penalty area. Nepal goalie Shekh was completely aware of the incoming shot and could have done better but let the ball slip with his misguided effort.Nepal immediately felt a sense of urgency after conceding and their constant pressure on the opponents was rewarded with two freekicks from dangerous range after 70 minutes.Abinash Syangtan failed to convert both freekicks but his first attempt was a further warning of what Nepal could do as Bhutan’s goalkeeper Lhocho Nima had to work really hard to keep the shot away.Nepal continued to apply pressure and it earned them their first reward as Kinzang Tenzin was sent off for a second yellow after harshly challenging Sabin Ghimire in the middle of the pitch.Tenzin’s departure proved costly for Bhutan as Nepal equalised only six seconds after the match resumed.Semanta tossed the resulting freekick for Lachhu Thapa, who sent a long ball into the six yard box for Dhami to head home with an incredible back-header.Samir Tamang almost put the game to bed in the 90th minute but his header off a long pass from Ram Thapa missed the goal by inches.Bhutan had a golden opportunity to shock Nepal in the fifth minute of injury time when Semanta’s poor attempt to clear the ball fell straight to the path of Namgyel. But the midfielder could not capitalise on the chance from near the spot kick, as the game went to tiebreaker. \nTop Chinese and U.S. officials discussed holding fresh talks between their heads of state in the near future, Chinese state media said on Wednesday, after China's top diplomat, Wang Yi, met U.S. national security adviser Jake Sullivan in Beijing.Both sides also agreed to hold video calls between their military theatre commanders \"at an appropriate time\", according to the Chinese readout from the meetings, a move that Washington hopes could prevent conflict in areas like the Taiwan Strait.\"The key to the smooth development of China-U.S. interaction lies in treating each other as equals,\" Wang told Sullivan according to state broadcaster CCTV.This is Sullivan's second day of talks with Wang and others, aimed at calming tensions between the two superpowers ahead of the Nov. 5 U.S. election.The meetings will last until Thursday and are expected to cover a range of areas where the two countries are at odds, including trade, the Middle East, Ukraine, and Chinese territorial claims from Taiwan to the South China Sea.Wang told Sullivan the U.S. should \"stop arming Taiwan and support peaceful 'reunification' of China\", adding that \"Taiwan belongs to China and that 'Taiwan independence' is the biggest risk to peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait\".According to the Chinese readout, Wang also expressed Beijing's disapproval of U.S. tariffs on a range of manufactured goods and export controls targeting Chinese chip makers, saying Washington should \"stop jeopardizing China's legitimate interests\".SOUTH CHINA SEAChina, the world's second-largest economy, whose vessels have repeatedly clashed with Philippine ships in the South China Sea, said the U.S. \"must not undermine China's sovereignty...nor support Philippines' 'infringing acts'\".Manila and Washington have a mutual defence treaty and the U.S. has vowed to aid the Philippines against armed attacks on its vessels and soldiers in the South China Sea.In the final months of his presidency, U.S. President Joe Biden has pushed direct diplomacy to influence Chinese President Xi Jinping to help keep tensions at bay. U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic candidate in November's election, would likely pursue a similar strategy if she succeeds Biden.In April, Biden and Xi navigated their countries' disagreements in a phone call, after deciding to significantly improve bilateral ties during a summit in San Francisco last November following a period of deep division over trade and the COVID pandemic.However, many analysts aligned with Republican former president Donald Trump see that approach as too soft, in the face of a more assertive Chinese foreign policy. Trump is his party's presidential candidate again in the November election.The U.S. also wants China to take more action at home to prevent the development of chemicals that can be made into fentanyl, the leading cause of U.S. drug overdoses, and reach an understanding on safety standards for artificial intelligence. \nIn 2008 Matina Shakya was only three years old when she was appointed as the Kumari of Kathmandu. She was succeeded by Trishna Shakya as the new Kumari in 2017.Kumaris are revered as goddesses of beauty and strength in certain Hindu and Buddhist traditions. Worshipping young girls as Kumaris is a 2,000-year-old practice in Nepal. Since the 13th century, when the Malla kings ruled, the Newars of the Kathmandu Valley have been worshipping Kumari, a girl from the Shakya/Bajracharya community chosen to embody the divine energy of goddess Taleju Bhawani. The reign of a Kumari ends when she starts menstruating. So long as she is serving as the Kumari, she is believed to be the nation’s divine protector, safeguarding it from evil. Matina, 18, is now in her first year of college, studying for a bachelor’s degree in management. Her father, Pratapman Shakya, when asked about having a daughter who is the only living the goddess in the world said, “Not having your own daughter live in the same house as you seemed a little unfair, but we feel very proud to call ourselves the parents of the royal Kumari who is revered by people all over the world.”On March 9, 2023, he, along with Matina, were getting ready for a special function held to honour all former Kumaris from across Nepal. “There are often events to honour Matina as she was the royal Kumari, but this one was dedicated to all former Kumaris from different areas. There are 129 living Kumaris in all,” he added. Besides Kathmandu, Kumari tradition is followed in Bhaktapur, Lalitpur, and Kirtipur, among other cities.According to him, this was the first time an event like this was organised and the Deputy Mayor of Kathmandu, Sunita Dangol, was also in attendance.Throughout the year, many people line up outside the ‘Kumari Ghar’ to get a chance to visit the Kumari and get her blessings. Many foreigners stand out in the yard to catch a glimpse of her. Nepali people believe that if a Kumari smiles at you, it is a bad omen.Everyday, a tutor visits the Kumari to help her continue with her education as she is not allowed to step outside the Kumari Ghar. She takes her exams and does her homework from the Kumari Ghar itself. She also has the freedom to play inside the Kumari Ghar. Many former kumaris have pursued careers in their fields of interest or studied after their term ends, and they continue to be treated with the same respect. The tradition of Kumari has evolved over time. In the past Kumaris did not enjoy these freedoms.Because of various superstitious beliefs, Kumaris were not fully educated and were forbidden from getting married because of the belief that the groom would die soon if he married an ex-Kumari. They led secluded lives, were restricted from participating in normal childhood activities, and focused solely on their religious duties.However, now, these myths have been dispelled. Modern understanding has shifted to recognise that Kumaris, after stepping down from their divine role, have the freedom to marry and lead a normal life. The perception of Kumaris as isolated figures has evolved, with a focus on providing them with a more balanced upbringing. There have been initiatives to integrate Kumaris into regular social and educational settings, allowing them to have a more holistic and fulfilling childhood experience. “Matina was already familiar with the students from the school that she attended after her term as Kumari ended,” said Shakya. “The kids visited the Kumari Ghar frequently so that she could have a smooth transition,” he added. According to Gautam Prasad Shakya, who has been living as a caretaker in the Kumari Ghar, the changes made to the tradition are minor. “The traditions of Kumari have mostly stayed the same. All the rituals are still practised like in the old days,” he said.On 6 May 2005, Pun Devi Maharjan, a lawyer, filed a case in the Supreme Court claiming that the traditional practice of electing young girls as Kumaris, or “goddesses’, who are expected to follow certain social restrictions and appear at religious festivals, violated the rights of the child. Quoting Maharjan’s complaint, Puskar Mathema writes in Yuwamanch Monthly of October 2007, “If Kumari tradition is continued, it will undermine the fundamental rights as well the freedoms of children guaranteed by the constitution and child rights treaties. Apart from this, it will have a negative impact on their physical and mental development.”The case continued while Nepal overthrew the monarchy and declared itself a secular state in 2007. When the judgement was pronounced in 2008, the goddess was still in her role, now giving blessings to the country’s President. The court ordered that the Kumaris and ex-Kumaris receive better benefits and arrangements and ordered the government to improve their support and allowances.In April 2006, Prof Chunda Bajracharya filed a petition at the Supreme Court against Maharjan’s petition, who had argued against the Kumari tradition. Bajracharya contended that the tradition should be preserved as heritage due to its over 100 years of history.“People who don’t understand the culture shouldn’t comment on it,” she stated. Bajracharya also criticised the human right activists who contended that Kumaris were only allowed to wear the colour red. “People who say Kumaris are forced to wear red clothing all the time, are the same people who send their kids to schools in uniform,” she said.“After the 2008 court verdict, there have been a lot of improvements. Now, a teacher visits the Kumari Ghar daily to tutor the Kumari, who is expected to complete school assignments and sit periodic exams. All the former Kumaris now get benefits like scholarships and special pensions,” she added.Bajracharya is currently a professor of literature at the Tribhuvan University in Kathmandu.“The only significant change that the court verdict brought to the tradition was in terms of her education,” said Gautam Prasad Shakya, the caretaker. “Kumaris were tutored long before the case, but the case helped formalise this arrangement. After the court verdict, the time between 12 pm and 4 pm was designated as the Kumari’s tuition time,” he added.After the verdict, there was a concerted effort to provide Kumaris with access to quality education, enabling them to develop the skills and knowledge needed to lead fulfilling lives beyond their divine roles. There was also a shift towards ensuring that the Kumari's living quarters are comfortable, safe, and conducive to her overall well-being.Moreover, the selection process for the Kumari underwent reforms in the aftermath of the Pun Devi Maharjan case. There was a push for greater transparency, accountability, and inclusivity in the selection of the Kumari, with an emphasis on ensuring that the process was fair, respectful, and free from undue influence.Efforts were made to support their transition into adulthood, including providing them with comprehensive resources for education, vocation, and social integration. This shift aimed to address the challenges faced by former Kumaris and empower them to lead independent and fulfilling lives after their divine service.“The Kumari tradition has evolved over time. During the tenure of my daughter, we saw a lot of improvements. Even after her time as Kumari, Matina continued to get a lot of government support,” said Shakya, former Kumari Matina’s father.“Some people argue that child rights are being violated, but all of her rights are being upheld inside the Kumari Ghar. This is a unique and respected aspect of Nepali culture, and I don’t believe it violates any of my child’s rights.”While the Kumari tradition continues, its practices have evolved. “She enjoys this normal life and it didn’t take her long to adjust as well,” says Matina’s father, on her transition from the revered Kumari to the ordinary Matina. \nWhat animals did Juddha Shumsher have in his zoo?“We only have records of animals from the mid-1960s,” says Ganesh Koirala, who has been employed at the Central Zoo for the past 36 years and currently serves as its information officer and programme officer. “That too I hand-copied from an old torn-down file that I came across.”Today, the Central Zoo, which sprawls across six hectares in Jawalakhel, Lalitpur, houses as many as 1,298 wild animals of different species of mammals, reptiles, fishes and birds from Nepal and around the world—from tiger, rhinoceros, hippopotamus and red panda to its recent attraction: a pair of chimpanzees.After enduring decades of neglect under various government bodies, with its animals and infrastructure scraping along in a deplorable state, the zoo received a new lease of life with improved infrastructure and animal care in 1995, when it came under the management of the King Mahendra Trust for Nature Conservation (KMTNC), now known as the National Trust for Nature Conservation, in 1995.Today, the Central Zoo is an entertainment venue, one of the most happening places in the Kathmandu valley. Flocked by thousands of daily visitors, the zoo now also hosts rescued animals and those in need of rehabilitation. It is also a site for conservation education.But when Juddha Shumsher Rana (prime minister from 1932–1945) built the Jawalakhel Zoological Garden on the premises of his Jawalakhel Durbar (where Nepal Administrative Staff College stands today) in 1932, he did so purely for private interests—as a space of entertainment and amusement for him and his family.Built in the semi-wilderness of Jawalakhel around a historical pond dating to the 17th century during the reign of King Siddhi Narsingh Malla, the zoo also became the space he could use to show his respect for two women he revered, his mother and sister-in-law, and indulge in one of his favourite pastimes—gambling.Today, the Central Zoo, nestled in the heart of Jawalakhel's sprawling crowd, does not go unnoticed, and its story is well told. But what passions drove Juddha to build the zoo? What was its original layout? What animals did it have in the beginning? And how did Juddha spend time there?“I remember once seeing a small board that read ‘Jawalakhel Zoological Garden’,” Koirala says. “I don’t know whether it was from Juddha’s time or was made in the later years. It must surely be that Juddha built the zoo out of influence from the British given how this term was used by them.”Koirala adds, “There is a former employee, now an elderly gentleman who worked in the zoo in the 1960s. He surely has some stories from Juddha’s time.”Birds, beasts and palacesTo trace the birth of Jawalakhel Zoological Garden, one has to look at the history of Nepal’s rulers owning birds and animals.Like rulers around the world, Nepal’s royalty kept wild and exotic birds and animals in captivity as a source of pleasure and mark of wealth and power. The book ‘Social History of Nepal’ by historians TR Vaidya, Tri Ratna Manandhar and Shankar Lal Joshi details how Mallas during the mediaeval Kathmandu Valley to Ranas and Shahs in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries owned rare, exotic creatures. In 1708, a rhinoceros in Kathmandu Valley broke the iron chain in which it was bound and killed its tamer. In 1714, Bhaktapur’s King Bhupatindra Malla gifted a camel and an elephant to Kantipur’s King Bhaskar Malla to build peace.Among Shahs, King Rana Bahadur Shah in particular was reputed for his collection of birds and animals. He also owned a zoo outside his palace in Basantapur Durbar Square, where the Nepal Bank Limited stands in New Road today. The zoo contained “tiger, bear, monkey, elephant, horse, deer… heron, peacock… pigeon, wild dogs, rabbits, rats, mongoose.”Jung Bahadur Rana’s zoo on the premises of his Thapathali Durbar hosted a variety of birds and animals collected during his hunting expeditions as well as those brought from abroad. Jung Bahadur himself used to “supervise and inspect it”. Juddha Shumsher likewise had his own collection of creatures which steadily expanded into a zoological garden. Seeking wilderness in his Jawalakhel DurbarJuddha’s biographer Ishwari Prasad writes in ‘The Life and Times of Maharaja Juddha Shumsher Jung Bahadur Rana’ that between 1933 and 1940, Juddha shot 433 tigers, 33 rhinoceros and 93 leopards. An insatiable big-game hunter, Juddha had a deep fondness for being in the wild and among wild animals, and from this came, according to oral history prevalent among members of Kathmandu’s Rana community including Juddha’s descendants, the desire to own a zoo.Built in 1752, Schönbrunn Zoo in Vienna, the world’s first modern zoo, was already over 100 years old when Juddha was born in 1875. London Zoo opened in 1828 and Alipore Zoological Garden (Kolkata Zoo) in 1875. Nawab Wajid Ali Shah Zoological Garden (Lucknow Zoo) was established in 1921. Juddha’s inspiration, his descendants say, was most likely reinforced by his tours to zoological gardens during his visits to England in 1908 and to different Indian cities.An article titled ‘Central zoo in state of neglect’ published in The Kathmandu Post in 1996 says that Juddha one day “received a pair of leopards as a gift”, cementing his desire to own a zoo. A report ‘Central Zoo Master Plan’ prepared by the KMTNC in 1996 says that Juddha decided to build a zoo in an epiphany when he saw that some animals “including deer, a few rhinos, and some tigers had been collected from the Tarai and kept in Kathmandu” could be put into one compound in the “lonely piece of land with a large 16th [sic] century Malla period Pokhari”.The pond lay still and serene surrounded by green wilderness ever since Patan’s King Siddhi Narsingh Malla built it in the 1600s. On the grounds surrounding this pond, the Newars from Na:Tole, Pulchowk and surroundings had their devisthans where, for centuries, they gathered to perform their religious ceremonies during Basanta Panchami and Bhoto Jatra even after this area fell within the Jawalakhel Durbar.For the palace, the ground served as its extended garden along with a horse and elephant stable. Subodh Rana, 69, grandson of Juddha Shumsher, recalled his father Kiran Shumsher telling him that Juddha and his family sometimes also used the scenic grounds for picnics. If there was any spot where Juddha wanted to build a menagerie, it would be around this Pokhari (pond). One day, he called his grandson General Maheshwar Shumsher Rana and deputed him to the task of doing just this.The zoo’s layout—except for the small plots of lands acquired later—that was in place when it came under KMTNC's management was, the present and retired zoo officials believe, mostly the same as it was built by Maheshwar and so offers a peek into how Juddha’s zoo must have been like. Pond in the middle of the ground surrounded by enclosures—the southern bank housing mainly larger animals, and cages for birds positioned on the northern banks.From pigeons to the king of the jungleWhat animals and birds did the enclosures at Juddha’s zoo house?“We cannot tell for sure,” Koirala says.Once it came under government ownership, the zoo was tossed from one institution to the other for lack of interest and knowledge on the right institution to manage it. Amid all this chaos, documents were possibly lost and the zoo has no concrete record about the animals that Juddha must have once taken amusement at, said Koirala.Mukti Narayan Shrestha, 82, a retired secretary of the Nepal government, joined the Central Zoo in 1970 as a veterinarian when many original structures of the zoo were still intact. Shrestha also worked with an elderly khardar who, he says, was employed in the zoo since the time of Juddha and was about to retire when he joined.“In those days where the purpose of menageries was exclusively for exhibition and pleasure with no regard for the welfare and recreation of animals and birds, the cages were tiny and iron-barred,” Shrestha says.Elephant, horses, deer, monkeys, tiger, rhinoceros, clouded leopard, red panda, bear, palm civet (nir biralo), four-horned antelope, Himalayan goral, pheasants, Himalayan monal—from the mythical and the majestic, the gentle and friendly to the fiery and ferocious, Juddha’s zoo boasted them all, Shrestha says.Shrestha’s account is not different from the anecdotes passed down to other retired and present zoo officials and the members of the Rana community, who also detail the rare and the exotic fauna, like the gharial crocodile and porcupine, even the jungle’s king—creatures, they say, that Juddha must have received from foreigners as gifts—appearing alongside domestic birds like pigeons.Tidbits of published information also confirm that the zoo had a good collection of exotic birds and animals from Nepal and abroad. One such suggestion comes from Kalyan Shumsher’s ‘Shree Teen Juddha Mahima’ published during Juddha’s reign in 1943.“One need not travel abroad to see the incredible birds and animals found in foreign countries,” he writes. “It will suffice to see [those creatures] right here in the zoo opened by His Holiness Shree 3 [Juddha] in Jawalakhel.”Among these incredible creatures, one reigned supreme—lion, the king of the jungle.For one, it would not have satiated Juddha to build a zoo and not have the jungle’s king exhibited in it. Juddha hence must have done everything possible to ensure one for the zoo. Infrastructure at the zoo suggests that the lion indeed lived at Juddha’s zoo or, in the least, during the Rana regime.“Where bear habitat lies today, there were two dome-shaped attached enclosures with a holding room, constructed in the classic architecture that many enclosures in the British zoos had in the past. They had brick walls and lime plaster,” Koirala says. “These were built to house a lion in one cage and a tiger in the other.”Near these enclosures stood another cage that remains intact today, with the head of a roaring lion carved out of the wall on the top of its iron bars. Zoo officials as well as members of the Rana community believe that Juddha had this exhibit built to specifically house a lion.Remarkably, these Juddha-era infrastructural spaces are corroborated by a rare piece of photographic evidence. A 1946 photo of the zoo shows a lion while a Kathmandu mother and her sons stand in front of its cage.Juddha’s place of piety and playThe zoo was not merely a space that Juddha sought out for amusement and retreat in the outpost of his palace; he also used this place to express his deepest affection.This affection spills right at the zoo’s entrance, in the form of the life-size statue of Karma Kumari Devi, wife of Juddha’s elder brother and Rana Prime Minister Dev Shumsher. Karma Kumari stands tall in her regal costume shaded by a wide canopy. Juddha revered Karma Kumari because it was she who raised him and looked after his mother Juhar Kumari Devi after the death of his father Dhir Shumsher. On another prominent part of the zoo on the south-east, Juhar Kumari’s enthroned statue overlooks the pond. Juddha had commissioned the London-based sculptor Domenico Antonio Tonelli to cast these statues.When Karma Kumari’s statue was unveiled is not clear, but Juhar Kumari’s statue was unveiled by Juddha amid a grand function in 1935 on Jawalakhel’s most auspicious day, Bhoto Jatra. It was attended by the British Resident Frederick Bailey.“On June 28, 1935, at Jawalakhel Durbar… the pond nearby looked very scenic,” says a Gorkhapatra news report titled ‘Statue installation’ dated July 5, 1935. “Because it was the day of Bhoto Jatra of Machhindranath… and moreover since an ideal woman’s statue was being unveiled, there was a crowd of lakhs of people.”Less than fifty metres from Karma Kumari’s statue stands a one-story building with a pagoda roof that today serves as the zoo’s meeting hall. Juddha, an avid gambler, found the scenic semi-wilderness covered in trees and filled with the sounds of wildlife to be a perfect place to relish the game. So he built a building with twelve doors on its four sides allowing him and his fellow gambling compatriots the freedom to enter through a particular door that they thought would bring luck. He called it his Juwa Ghar, the gambling house, and built it with the sole purpose of indulging in the game he loved. Roar of lion reverberates in KathmanduThe sounds of the animals and birds in the zoo rose up in the Jawalakhel sky. Every day, until much later in the 1970s, roar of the zoo’s lion (there were later other lions) diffused to far corners of the Valley, merging the zoo with the spirit of Kathmandu and informing the city folks of its presence.But was the zoo open to the public as well?“I think once it was built, the zoo was open for the public,” Subodh Rana said. “It is unlikely that Juddha Shumsher built such a large zoo and kept it only for his family.”For one, Kalyan Shumsher mentioning that one “need not travel abroad to see the incredible birds and animals found in foreign countries” suggests that the public had at least some access to the zoo. Of course, the Newar community from Na:Tole, Pulchowk and surrounding areas were permitted inside the zoo on the days of their guthi functions on Basanta Panchami and Bhoto Jatra.As the zoo was established at the back of the ground where Bhoto Jatra celebrations happen, it naturally filled with revellers on this day in addition to the guthi ritual observers as testified by the Gorkhapatra report. The photo of the mother and her sons also bear testimony that the zoo was not entirely closed to the public.What is widely believed, though, is that the zoo officially came under government ownership after Nepal became a democracy in 1951. And it would still be a few more years before it was open to the public in 1956.In 1945, Juddha gave up his power and eventually retired in Dehradun, India, where he died in 1952. With time, Jawalakhel Zoological Garden became the Central Zoo. It would take many avatars—a neglected site of crammed, unmaintained cages with sad eyes of emaciated creatures staring from behind the bars, a focal point of animal diplomacy, particularly during the period of monarchy, to, in its recent decades, a space of conservation and education.When all this was happening, the city sprawled around Jawalakhel, subduing the lion’s roar with its noise. More wildlife from around the country and the world came—creatures captured from the wild, those sold by circuses, those rescued from traffickers. Fate would bring these creatures to the care of generations of Kathmandu folks, intertwining each other’s joys and sorrows. After the tale of Juddha’s Jawalakhel Zoological Garden, there would be these stories to tell. Sitting around a table inside Juddha’s Juwa Ghar, Koirala and other zoo officials begin unfolding these stories before me. \nNepal’s book market is no stranger to the popular Bangladeshi-Swedish writer Taslima Nasrin. Almost all of her books have been translated into Nepali, but Nasrin herself says that they are all unauthorised translations. “All books [Nepali translations] are pirated versions,” Nasrin told the Post in a Whatsapp conversation. Nasrin, who is currently in exile in India after facing death threats in Bangladesh following the publication of her novel Lajja (Shame), said that she or her publishers have never allowed anyone the right to translate her books into Nepali. “I don’t know of any such Nepali publishers. No one asked for permission and no one has paid [me] royalty.”Translating and publishing books without permission from authors or publishers is a punishable crime. But Nepal’s book market is full of such unauthorised translations and prints of books written by the who’s who of the world literature. Such endeavours haven’t just hurt the authors but also the readers, says Ajit Baral, publisher of the Kathmandu-based Fineprint publication. “These translations are poor,” Baral says. “Tomes with 1200–1300 pages have been trimmed to 200–300 pages. An example is the biography of Bill Clinton.”Another popular book that has seen unauthorised Nepali translation is the biography of Steve Jobs by Walter Isaacson.“We have no official deal in place for a [Nepali] translation of Steve Jobs,” Peppa Mignone, associate agent of the CAA, the translation authority of the biography, said in an email interview with the Post.The book’s Nepali translation is published by Panchpokhari Publication House. The translated book identifies the translator thus: “Achyut Koirala, who has a master’s in English literature, is primarily a journalist. He is currently affiliated with Nagarik daily. He keeps a close tab on international history, politics and culture and has written scripts and dialogues for half a dozen Nepali films. He has published over a dozen non-fiction books.”Koirala, who admits to the unauthorised translation, claims that he hasn’t just translated the book but has also done ‘creative writing’ with it.‘Rich Dad Poor Dad’, written by Robert Kiyosaki and Sharon Lechter, is among the books that’s perennially on the bestseller list across the world. Upon investigation, the Post found three Nepali translations of the book—all unauthorised. One of them is translated by Dilip Kumar Shrestha and published by the same firm, the Panchpokhari Publication House. Another Nepali iteration of the book is published by Book For All publication and translated by Kopila MD. Yet another Nepali version is translated by one Sudheer Dixit and published by Plata Publication, Kathmandu.In an email conversation with the Post, Ronson Taylor, who oversees the international rights at The Rich Dad Company, said, “At this point in time, we do not have a relationship with an established publisher in the [Nepali] language market. If there are any Rich Dad Poor Dad books currently for sale in the Nepali market, they are pirated.”Basanta Thapa, a writer and translator, says that many books are being translated of late to make easy money. “But how would the quality of these unauthorised translations be!” Thapa wonders. “Readers who haven’t read the original wouldn’t know the faults in the translated versions.” Thapa says that any translator worth his salt aims to ‘recreate’ a book and it takes much work to do that.Taslima’s books are the major victimsTaslima’s memoir Uttal Hawa has been translated into Nepali as ‘Sangharsha’, literally Struggle, and is published by Khoji Publication House. Even though the book in its cover claims that it is an authorised translation from the English version Wild Wind, it is a pirated one. The book is translated by Bikash Basnet and edited by Bhogiraj Chamling. A revised version of the book is edited by Sangeet Srota (Yam Bahadur Chhetri).The same publication house has also published the Nepali translation of the book’s sequel as ‘Prem ra Jeevan’. Publisher Sushil Chalise says that while he is aware that one needs to receive permission from the author or the publisher to translate a book, his efforts to contact Taslima were unsuccessful. Therefore, he had published the version the translator made available to him. Translator Basnet, too, admits he translated the book without Taslima’s permission. “About a decade back, we didn’t know how to ask for permission,” he said.Nepal has the Copyright Act (2002) in place. Before it, there was the The Patent, Design and Trade Mark Act, 2022 (1965) that included intellectual property in its 2006 revision. Even the Muluki Ain (Civil Code) of 1910 BS had a provision about copyright. Moreover, it goes without saying that translating somebody else’s work without permission is immoral.Likewise, Indigo Ink Pvt Ltd has published a Nepali translation of Taslima’s anthology of essays No Country for Women as ‘Aaimai ko Kunai Desh Chhaina’. The book is translated by Krishna Giri and edited by Pramod Pradhan. “I have no idea about the agreement between the publisher and translator,” Pradhan, who is also a children’s book writer, says. “I just copy-edited it upon request.”Bishnukumar Poudel, publisher of Indigo Ink, however, claims that he is still trying to take translation rights for the book. “We translated the book long ago,” he says. “We are still trying to get translation rights.”Indigo is also publishing unauthorised translations under its imprints All Book Store Pvt Ltd, Book for All and Plata Publication. It has published two versions of Rich Dad Poor Dad under those shadow imprints. But Plata Publication is not registered in the Company Registrar’s Office.Pradhan says that many foreign books have had unauthorised translations in Nepali and their quality is poor. Those books are translated not from the original language but from a second or third language, so these translations are bound to have problems, he says. “After I learned that those were unauthorised translations, I have stopped editing them,” Pradhan said.Indian author Shiv Khera’s You Can Win has been translated into Nepali by Bloomsbury India and has granted the distribution rights to Ekta Books. But the book’s unauthorised translations are also found in the market and they don’t even mention the name of the publisher and translator. What is interesting is they mention that it’d be illegal to republish the book, or an excerpt of it, without the author’s permission.The Nepali translation of the book, which was poorly written and rife with inaccuracies, had landed the publisher at court. After a complaint was filed at the District Court Kathmandu in 2066BS on the charge that the publisher violated the copyrights and economic rights, the court had issued a verdict on Mangsir 11 that year, charging a fine of Rs10,000, Rs20,000 and Rs30,000 to the defendants Netra Prasad Pokharel, Narayan Prasad Bhusal, and Bhagwati Risal and Bishnu Silwal, respectively.Baral, the Fineprint publisher, says that international publishers wouldn’t demand much for translation rights given Nepal’s small market, but Nepali publishers do not bother to reach out to them. “Publishers who put out unauthorised translations and sell them at 50 percent discount have troubled publishers like us,” he said.Fineprint has published authorised translated versions of books such as Leaving Microsoft to Change the World by John Wood, Healed by Manisha Koirala, and Hippie by Paulo Coelho. The publication house is also set to release the Nepali translation of Israeli historian Yuval Noah Harari’s bestseller Sapiens. Translated into Nepali by Dinesh Kafle, the book’s translation right was acquired at the cost of USD1300, Baral said. Likewise, the publication acquired the translation rights of Sadhguru’s Inner Engineering at IRS93,000, he added.Baral says that publication of unauthorised translations is an immoral and illegal work. “This phenomenon not just hampers Nepal’s fledgling book publishing industry but also tarnishes the country’s reputation in the global market,” Baral said.Thapa, the writer and translator, points out the lack of regulatory mechanisms in the country. “We don’t have an agency that regulates the quality of translations being done,” he says. “Nobody compares the translation with the original. We need a dedicated authority to enhance the quality of translation.” Universities, Nepal Academy and other stakeholders can play a role to uplift the translation sector, he adds.One’s pain, another’s pleasureWhen the author Suketu Mehta was travelling through Mumbai, a young man approached him with a handful of books while his vehicle was stuck in traffic. Brandishing Maximum City, written by none other than Mehta himself, the young man requested the author to buy a copy. Suketu leafed through the book and said, “This is a pirated copy and I’m the author of this book.” The youth wasn’t bothered and replied, “Okay, you can buy it at a discount.”This anecdote was shared to the Post by Mehta’s friend, the author and professor Amitava Kumar, in an email exchange.Most of these pirated books are imported into Nepal from India while the retailers of original books are finding themselves increasingly in trouble. “We sell original copies but many readers doubt us as well, given the ubiquity of pirated versions,” says Anjan Shrestha, operator of Education Book House, Jamal.Ramchandra Timothy, chair of Thapathali-based Ekta Books Pvt Ltd, said that the phenomenon of piracy has tarnished Nepal’s image internationally. “There was a time when Bangladesh would be known as ‘piracy king’,” he said. “Now there's a risk Nepal would take the crown.”As tax increases, so does piracyThe government decision to impose a 10 percent tax on book imports in fiscal year 2019-20 led to a proliferation of pirated book markets, booksellers say. After the decision, booksellers started to cut back on imports and that led to the entry of a new crop of pirated booksellers, a trader in Kathmandu says. But following widespread backlash, then finance minister Bishnu Paudel struck down the policy.“After the government’s decision, we stopped importing books for a while,” says Shrestha of Education Books. “The import of books went down for about two years. Then the pirates stepped in to fill the gap. It was about that time that pirated copies of biographies and memoirs of Obamas and Jai Shettys became omnipresent in the market.”Pirated copies of classics by Roald Dahl and JK Rowling also made an entry in the Nepali market. Then the phenomenon only saw a rise.Since the customs department does not levy duty on foreign books and also does not care to differentiate between the pirated and original copies, unauthorised books have found a safe haven in Nepali market.The government doesn’t levy any customs duty on books and newspapers published by foreign publishers abroad. The importers should only pay Rs565 at the customs points. But Nepali publishers have to pay 10 percent tax to import books printed in India.James Taylor, director of Communications and Freedom to Publish of the International Publishers Association, says that the government, publishers, writers and readers should join hands to control widespread piracy. “The government should realise that book publishing and reading culture contribute to the country’s economy as well,” he said, adding that the government should seize pirated books and close websites that sell pirated ebooks.Nandan Jha, executive vice chair of Penguin Random House India’s sales, production and business department, says that piracy has emerged as a big challenge for publishers of late and has harmed the authors, publishers, distributors, printers, readers and other stakeholders. “To confront piracy, all the stakeholders should launch a special joint effort,” Jha told the Post in an email exchange.Piracy has proliferated in the Nepali market to such an extent that the publishers of such books and unauthorised translations keep whatever ISBN numbers they like, often conflicting with other books, and still get off scot free. If scanned or searched on the internet, the ISBN number gives details on the author of the book, what the book is about, and its price, among others.Bijay Sharma, information officer at TU Library, says, “Keeping ISBN number at one’s will is illegal. If anyone files a complaint, we can punish them.”By the lawThe Muluki Ain-1910 BS had mandated that a publisher take permission of Gorkha Bhasa Prakashini Samiti before publishing any material. The Copyrights Act came into effect in 2022 BS and was amended in 2054 BS. In 2059 BS, a new Act was promulgated and it is still effective now. Authorities are currently working to amend the Act to give the registrar’s office more autonomy regarding copyright.According to the 2059 BS Act, copyright violations are considered government cases. In such cases, plaintiffs should file a complaint with the police. The Act’s clause 25 has various conditions that amount to violation of copyright. The Act’s subclause A says that if a publisher produces or copies material in writing or sound and sells or distributes it, it amounts to violation of copyright.Likewise, the Act’s clause 26 prevents selling of unauthorised material. The clause restricts the ‘importation of copies of work or sound recording, either made in a foreign country or sourced otherwise, into Nepal for business purpose shall not be permitted if preparation of such copies would be considered illegal if they were prepared in Nepal.’If anyone infringes upon protected rights, they are liable to punishment but the provision’s implementation remains lax.The law gives the authority to district court to take legal action against copyright violators.Advocate Parshuram Koirala says that if the government becomes more proactive, it can punish violators on the basis of the 2059 BS Act and thereby control the phenomenon of intellectual theft and copyright violations. “Creation is a crucial part of humanity’s benefit,” he says. “If intellectual property is not protected effectively, then there’d be no inspiration to create something.”Bal Bahadur Mukhiya, a professor at Nepal Law Campus, suggests the inclusion of rules about digital piracy in law, and also the clauses of various related international treaties and agreements that Nepal is part of.“In the US, a teacher or professor should pay a certain revenue even to photocopy a chapter of some text for teaching purposes,” Mukhiya says. “But in Nepal, those who photocopy an entire book and sell it go scot free.”(This report is prepared in collaboration with the Centre for Investigative Journalism, Nepal.) \nIt has been such a long journey for Pushpa Kamal Dahal since he broke away from the Communist Party of Nepal (Unity Centre) to form the Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist) and waged a People's War in Nepal. The travails of the arduous trip from the remote villages of mid-mountains where the first guns against the government were fired on February 13, 1996, to an unceremonious ouster from what appears to have been his last stint as prime minister on July 12, 2024, seem to have taken a heavy toll on the Maoist supremo. Struggling to retain the leadership of a party that he steered away from armed insurgency to parliamentary politics, Dahal increasingly looks and sounds like a defeated captain of a dispirited team.In the mid-1990s, sabotaging the parliamentary system within five years of its restoration appeared foolhardy. But for impetuous and ambitious politicos, the pull of romanticism is invariably stronger than the restraint of rationality. Dahal displayed uncanny leadership in bringing Mohan Baidya out of his defeatism, convincing Baburam Bhattarai that his development theses needed the power of guns for their implementation and motivating Ram Bahadur Thapa to organise a fighting force of the deprived from almost nothing. The leftwing intelligentsia in Kathmandu was quick to manufacture apologia for the armed insurgency. The intellectual vigilantes of the Panchayat regime joined the communist chorus to discredit democracy. Naxalite remnants of the Jhapa Rebellion emerged from the Communist Party of Nepal (United Marxist-Leninist) ranks to act as overground mouthpieces of the underground insurgency. By the late 1990s, Dahal, under his nom de guerre Prachand, was a mythical hero with charismatic leadership qualities ascribed to his name. It didn’t help that parliamentary parties in the late 1990s had begun to disgrace themselves with unparliamentary activities.The post-facto legitimation of the armed insurgency almost fell into the lap of Maoists once King Gyanendra staged the “creeping coup” with the dissolution of the parliament and the dismissal of former prime minister Sher Bahadur Deuba between May and October 2002. After the autogolpe of February 1, 2005, it suddenly dawned upon parliamentary parties that tackling an autocratic monarch was more important than trembling in the imaginary fears of a Maoist takeover. Dahal lost no time in clutching the olive branch extended by the Seven Party Alliance (SPA), struggling for the reinstitution of parliament. The role of Indian interlocutors in formulating the 12-point Understanding is undeniable, but it was a win-win for both signatories: SPA conferred political legitimacy upon the Maoists and received the backing of an armed organisation controlling a significant territory in return.Peace processGirija Prasad Koirala had decided to call his deal with the outlawed Maoists merely an ‘understanding’ even though some of its provisions were revolutionary. The third point of the pact put the Maoist militia and the soldiers of the then Royal Army on the same footing and envisioned keeping them “under the United Nations or a reliable international supervision during the process of the election of constituent assembly”.The internationalisation of opposition to an autocratic monarchy inadvertently delegitimised the military. Once forced to choose between a discredited king on the one hand and popular acceptance with international approval on the other, the Royal Army took a while but decided to back the winning side during the April Uprising of 2006. The Comprehensive Peace Accord (CPA) 2006 was the formalisation of Maoists’ entry into competitive politics, and once they accepted to be admitted into the interim parliament in 2007, their revolutionary dreams were put into the cupboard where they were to shrivel and die in neglect.By January 15, 2011, when the United Nations Mission in Nepal (UNMIN) was driven out of Nepal without completing its task, the peace process had become proverbial “Birbal’s Khichdi” put up above the stove to prove the point that Maoists needed to irrevocably discard their agenda and ideology.The Constituent Assembly elected in 2008 had derived its claim to sovereignty from the success of the April Uprising, the CPA and the interim constitution. It was dissolved through a judicial coup. The legislative assembly formed through the elections conducted by an extra-constitutional arrangement possessed the legitimacy conferred upon it by the Supreme Court. However, only a sovereign, a popular movement, a revolution or a parliamentary decision has the mandate to confer sovereignty upon an elected, appointed or usurping body. The so-called second Constituent Assembly was legitimate but not sovereign. Maoists lost the game by being a willing participant in the political charade. The re-energised PEON graciously granted them the Enforced Disappearances Inquiry and the Truth and Reconciliation Commission on April 21, 2014, through an act of parliament to save face.Transitional JusticeThe Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) and the Commission of the Investigation on Enforced Disappeared Persons (CIEDP) were formed in 2015. However, the Supreme Court took the wind out of their sails by decreeing that several provisions of the very act under which they had been formed were unconstitutional and in conflict with international standards. In the absence of a legal framework, there was little that the statuary commissions could do to formalise the mechanism of transitional justice. They folded up once the Maoists were further marginalised through the first parliamentary elections in 2017 under the fast-tracked constitution.There are two ways for renegades to lose their class consciousness. The process of bourgeoisification, defined as the adoption of the characteristics of the bourgeoisie, first turns the leadership into an imitative aristocracy with tastes more expensive than the legitimate sources of income can sustain.Analogous to bourgeoisification, embourgeoisement turns the rank and file of a once-revolutionary organisation into meek conformists of social, cultural, economic and lifestyle values of the bourgeoisie. Dahal’s decision to merge his party into the CPN-UML on May 17, 2018, was as much an acceptance of ground realities as a desire to align with the Xi Jinping Thought. The Supreme Court dissolved the nascent Nepal Communist Party on March 8, 2021, and Dahal’s ambitions once again grew wings. By playing egoistic Deuba and calculative Khadga Prasad Sharma Oli against each other, he managed to lead the government for almost two years. The Transitional Justice Bill, recently passed by both houses of parliament, is the mechanism through which the dominant trio of Nepali politics wants to bury the past and move on.Terming it a flawed step forward, three international human rights organisations have welcomed the legislation with some reservations. The United Nations Human Rights Office has urged for its victim-centred implementation. But other than the NGO industry of Kathmandu and the limousine liberals of Lalitpur, there seems to be little interest among the larger public in the impending law.The processes of establishing truth, justice, reparation, memorialisation and guarantees of non-recurrence are essential elements of transitional justice. Its purpose, however, is to transform an unjust regime into a just one that ensures liberty, equality, fraternity, secularity and inclusive participation in governance for its citizens. It’s extremely unlikely that the present dispensation will do any such thing to loosen its ethnonational hegemony. With the help of Deuba and Sharma Oli, Dahal may succeed in burying dreams of a just regime, but peace of the cemeteries is inherently unstable.  \nSeventy-three years have passed since the 1951 revolution and the fall of the Rana autocracy. However, the economic prosperity that the movement imagined remains elusive. Countries with economies similar to ours in the 1950s forged ahead while we fell behind. Korea, Singapore and Taiwan are now on par with the so-called First World. While China has boosted its economy, and India is close behind, we are now the second poorest country in South Asia, just above Afghanistan. Why did we lag behind?The lack of educated, enlightened political leadership is at the core of the answer. Economic development in a knowledge economy requires the country's political leadership to acknowledge meritocracy, quality education and skills appropriate to the needs of the economy and pursue policies to enhance them. Education and skilled human resources are considered the prime movers of all successful economies. Take South Korea (called Korea hereafter) for example.KoreaIn South Korea, the leaders, including dictators like Syngman Rhee and Park Chung Hee (1948-79), were highly educated. They understood the importance of quality education and pursued policies to ensure it. Chung Hee brought the human resource concept into the policy. Korea's literacy rate increased by 2.6 percent annually from 1945 to 1968, reaching nearly 90 percent in 1968 and almost 100 percent in 2014. The GDP per capita grew from $94 in 1961 to nearly $3,200 in 2020. Korean secondary school students rank amongst the top in the Programme for International School Assessment (PISA), higher than the Western industrialised countries. Korean Government facilitates \"reading programs and movements, creating a desirable reading environment in homes, kindergartens, schools and communities, with particular help for those with special needs such as senior citizens, prisoners, the disabled, or families from other cultures, and finally, improvement in the infrastructure of libraries, as described above\", under their Reading Promotion Culture Act. With a population of about 52 million, according to Statista, in 2023, Korea had \"335 higher education institutions, comprising four-year universities and junior colleges with a two- or three-year curriculum\". Korea had the highest percentage of tertiary education graduates among the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development countries. Moreover, it has 583 vocational schools and considers libraries integral to a country's education and economic development like the developed world. As of 2020, it had 22,400 libraries managed under the \"Library Act\". The Presidential Committee on Library and Information Policy implements and controls library policies. Confucian ideas embedded in Southeast Asian culture emphasised meritocracy and education, enhancing education in Southeast Asian countries and China. Jawaharlal Nehru knew India could only compete in the knowledge economy with world-class educational institutions. He founded the Indian Institute of Technology and the Institute of Marketing and Management. The country is now one of the world's largest economies. Nepal’s scenario People with little or no formal education have led Nepal for several decades. The country does not have a culture of scholarship. Scrutiny at the cabinet-level appointments tells us that our political leaders do not acknowledge the value of scholarship, education, expertise and knowledge required to run a modern government and promote a knowledge economy. Politicians without subject knowledge occupy highly technical ministerial positions such as the Minister of Finance, Minister of Physical Development, etc. Since educational institutions are highly politicised, mediocracy prevails through the government. Political parties use teachers and students alike to promote their political agenda. Literacy enhancement and quality education have never been Nepali politicians' priorities. Nepal's literacy rate grew by about 1 percent from 1952 to 2022. It was 71.15 percent in 2022. Its GDP per capita increased from $51 in 1961 to $1,337 in 2022. The country has around 13 central universities and six academies of health sciences, and many other provincial universities are in the pipeline. However, most existing universities are poorly equipped, and Western universities do not recognise their degree. The schools face similar situations, as the standards are far from promising and have fallen even lower than during the Panchayat era. Over 52 percent of the students failed in a recent Secondary Education Examination. Nepal has no Library Act, and most Nepali schools lack libraries. A country of nearly 30 million people has no functioning national library. I have been involved in establishing libraries in rural Nepal through the Nepal Library Foundation for the past 19 years. When I expressed my frustration about the lack of cooperation from the government to a friend, he said, “How can you expect cooperation from a government whose leaders seldom read a book for pleasure or learning? A library does not mean anything to them. That is why we, a nation of nearly 30 million people, do not have a Library Act and one decent library. Do you remember the previous Oli government stopping the work on the design of the Nepal National Library in the Jamal area?”Why did we lag? Over the years, our political leaders have reached the pinnacle of power with little or no education and have refused to recognise the importance of meritocracy, quality education and human resource development. In addition, we suffer from a culture of mediocrity. Mediocrity is soul-destroying; it neither serves nor inspires. It breeds complacency. If we are to realise the dream of 1951, the mediocracy that dominates our governance must be replaced by meritocracy. We need educated, enlightened leaders who understand the 21st-century knowledge economy and do what it takes to prepare for it. Our political leadership should expand literacy, improve the quality of education, tie education with economic development strategy and immediately depoliticise education. \nWhile briefing about her official visit to India, from August 18 to 22, Foreign Minister Arzu Rana Deuba told the Nepali Congress (NC) central committee meeting on Friday that New Delhi’s response to Nepal's new coalition government was ‘positive’. This was a very cautious diplomatic statement. The term ‘positive’ in a diplomatic sense is unambiguously suboptimal in contrast to [being] ‘excited’ or ‘enthusiastic’. There is no hiding the fact that New Delhi was ‘okay’ with the replacement of the Moaist-CPN (UML) coalition by the NC-UML, but it has only sent lukewarm signals on the ascendance of KP Sharma Oli as prime minister, once again. Prime Minister Oli has made it a point to invite his Indian counterpart, Narendra Modi, through Foreign Minister Rana to visit Nepal; Oli has yet to receive a similar invitation despite newly appointed Indian foreign secretary Vikram Misri paying a two-day official visit to Nepal just two weeks ago. Many have viewed this as the lingering trust deficit between Oli and Modi.Be that as it may, New Delhi left no stone unturned to welcome Foreign Minister Rana and exude utmost warmth seldom seen during a foreign minister-level visit from Nepal. Rana had reportedly planned a private visit to Delhi for routine health check-up. On short notice, the South Block not only elevated it to a full-fledged official visit with an immediate invitation from her Indian counterpart, S Jaishankar, but also managed to schedule her appointment with Prime Minister Modi. Additionally, Modi accorded high importance to this meeting by involving key policymakers, including Foreign Minister Jaishankar, National Security Advisor Ajit Doval, Foreign Secretary Misri, Principal Secretary PK Mishra and Indian Ambassador to Nepal Naveen Srivastava.Shifting the neutral gearEqually rare in history, Indian and Nepali media alike positively portrayed Rana's India visit as a new stepping stone to pace the Nepal-India relations stuck in the neutral gear for at least a decade. Several serendipities worked: First, India needed a convincing diplomatic feat to reassure its neighbours that Modi's ‘neighbourhood first’, an overarching foreign policy instrument, has not faced a comprehensive debacle, even after the recent regime change in Bangladesh—India supported Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, who was compelled to resign and flee her country. Moreover, there has been a rise in anti-Indian politics in other neighbouring countries like Sri Lanka and Maldives.Second, Rana is not unfamiliar to Modi and Delhi’s power corridors. As the spouse of the five-time prime minister Sher Bahadur Deuba, she has had several opportunities for introduction and interaction with them. This certainly provides comfort in rolling the conversations, which are valuable in diplomatic dealings. It may seem trivial, but unlike many Nepali ministers, her English language skills and aristocratic sophistication come to her advantage in diplomacy.Third, the New Delhi establishment seemed unapologetically keen to recognise her as a (new) trusted friend in the Congress outfit and see her succeed in the first-ever ministerial responsibility. This has sent tremour waves to national politics back home. The coalition partner UML perhaps sees New Delhi's treatment of Rana as the manifestation of her special relations, something beyond what the government as a whole enjoys. Also, quite a few old-school compatriots in her party have now anxiously raised their eyebrows, assuming that India's trust may inch her forward in a bid to the party’s larger political role and government.Substantive issuesBeyond extensive paraphernalia, both sides claimed to have covered a broad range of issues of mutual interest, including the infrastructure and other projects related to cross-border railways, roads and bridges, Integrated Check Posts, petroleum pipelines and digital financial connectivity. Moreover, the increase in electricity export, reaching 1,000 megawatts, and the opportunities available in power sector cooperation after implementing the long-term power trade agreement were highlighted by both sides after her visit.However, a few contentious issues need deeper explorations than the tangential treatment they received in these bilateral talks. Straight air routes through Indian aerospace for the international flights operated to and from Nepal's newly constructed international airports in Bhairahawa and Pokhara, and clarity on the future of Gurkha recruitment in the Indian army are a few issues Nepal wants to see resolved soon. Operationalising electronic fund transfer gateways as the two prime ministers agreed a year ago and hassle-free processing to implement India-funded ‘small’ local development projects are on India's priority card.According to her post-visit briefing, Rana’s priority list included implementing the Pancheshwar Multipurpose Project and constructing a cross-border bridge over the Mahakali River connecting two countries. It was natural to show interest on her part, as the project agreement was signed 28 years ago when her husband became prime minister for the first time. The Mahakali border river, the location of the project site, runs along the political constituency of Deuba in Nepal’s far west. Furthermore, Rana made Kailali her political base in the same province.Regarding the Pancheshwar Project, India and Nepal’s priorities have diverged for a long time; the former preferred to optimise water use, and the latter focused on electricity production. Currently, as the power trade arrangements are gradually implemented, the interests seem to be converging. The peripheral issues of upper or lower riparian benefits, their components and pricing should no longer serve as constricting impediments. The enthusiasm rekindled in Kathmandu and Delhi to implement the project must not sublimate for decades, like in the past.Rana has had many firsts this time around. She became a minister for the first time, and it was her first official visit to any foreign nation as a minister. Besides, this is her first political and diplomatic responsibility, independent of nurturing her husband's political persona. Finally, her insight in navigating the complex geopolitical manoeuvres confronting Nepal will prove her mettle as a capable future leader of the country. And, her ability to manage the political waves that she created, possibly by winning the confidence of influential southern neighbours, may add at least some score to her future leadership bid in the Nepali Congress.  \nMosquitoes are climbing Nepal’s hills and mountains, marking their presence in areas that were not their traditional habitats. Accordingly, the number of people infected by the mosquito-borne dengue virus is soaring. A mosquito-borne vector infection, dengue is mostly found in tropical and sub-tropical climates and is concentrated in urban and semi-urban areas. According to the World Health Organization, about half of the world’s population is at risk of dengue, and around 100-400 million infections occur each year. Most districts of Nepal have seen a surge in dengue infections in the past couple of years, putting ill-equipped health centres, especially in the hills, which are new to dengue, under stress. Since January of this year alone, Nepal has seen over 5,000 cases and at least three deaths. In Sankhuwasabha, the district hospital is short of beds and healthcare workers. The situation there is so precarious that people have ended up on the floor, corridor, chairs, storeroom and hospital compound. This, however, is nothing new in the country—the Covid-19 pandemic exposed our inability to handle large-scale emergencies owing to a lack of infrastructure and preparedness. The fact that a disease like dengue has reached the mountains also confirms that we are amid a major climate crisis. With the rising temperatures, mosquitoes carrying dengue have gained climate adaptive potential and thrived in colder climates—or the previously colder areas that are slowly warming up. Even though other mountain districts like Humla and Mustang haven’t reported any cases this year yet, we cannot deny the possibility. Equally concerning is the lack of community-level cleanliness, sanitation and preventive measures. Government bodies often claim they are searching and destroying the mosquito breeding grounds, but the results do not corroborate their claims. One might wonder what the government is doing amid such a health crisis. The truth is that it is not taking this vector-borne disease seriously. Nor have there been satisfactory efforts to equip the healthcare centres struggling with less manpower, insufficient medicines and space shortages. With the changing nature of mosquitoes, it is also necessary to conduct comprehensive research to be alert in upcoming years. Notably, this year, hill districts have seen thousands of positive cases while Madhesh, the comparatively hotter region, province has reported only 77 cases. This discrepancy also should be taken into consideration.Experts worry that the escalation of risks in those areas that aren’t traditional dengue hotspots has turned things upside down. Our infrastructures have not seen any progress for so long, but things have changed, and endemics have started emerging in new areas. But we haven’t invested in strengthening healthcare infrastructures accordingly. The time has come to heed experts’ concerns and deal with this change by allocating more budget for the health sector and upgrading their patient-accommodating capacities. In the short run, the government should conduct search and destroy programmes, cleanliness and sanitation drives, and increase the supply of medicines and human resources in affected areas. If not, these seemingly trivial mosquitoes can pose more danger in the days to come. \nTikTok, a widely popular social media app, is set to come back to the Nepali market after the KP Sharma Oli-led government decided to lift a ban imposed by the previous government headed by Pushpa Kamal Dahal. The then government had raised moral concerns about the app, but now Oli wants to run it with considerable regulatory changes, which will take some time. Even though TikTok was often used to incite communal emotions and spread vulgarity, many took an outright ban as a violation of self-expression and free speech and cited that the app also had positive sides. Therefore, the incumbent government’s decision can be seen as a win-win situation in terms of freedom of expression and the need to demarcate the limits of freedom. For it to be able to resume its operations, TikTok is now mandated to fulfil certain conditions, such as promoting Nepal’s tourism, investing in digital literacy, uplifting Nepal’s public education system and keeping a watch on the content used on the site. According to data before the ban, the app housed around 2.2 million users nationwide, accounting for nearly 40 percent of bandwidth consumption. Having faced revenue loss for months, the social media site seems to have agreed to abide by the government’s directives about its fair use. Now that there will finally be a regulatory directive to handle TikTok, the government should focus on successfully implementing it. The world of social media is quite tricky, as anyone from anywhere can flout the rules and continue misusing them from the backstage. People kept running the app right under the government’s nose using virtual private networks (VPN). How the newly agreed-upon terms of engagement between the social media site and the Nepali government come into effect will be for us all to see in the near future.Being arguably the most misused social media app for causing social unrest, TikTok became the only site banned by the government. However, the concerns raised during its ban apply to other social media apps as well, not least Facebook, X and Instagram, with 10.58 million, 4.66 million and 3.60 million users, respectively. These apps continue to be sites of misogyny, racism, casteism and misinformation, among other concerns of discrimination and discord. But they have also offered many opportunities to voice their opinions and make themselves heard. They have provided youth with employment and entrepreneurship opportunities, not least in Nepal, where we have a vibrant community of social media influencers, celebrities and entrepreneurs. Banning TikTok, or any other medium of expression for that matter, is never a solution, and the current government seems to have realised it. But it should remain vigilant not to let any such social media site become a tool of misuse, exploitation and social discord. The general public should also be sensitised about how grave an impact their irrational behaviours can have in a country like ours which values mutual trust, cooperation as well as religious harmony. There is no other option but to follow the regulations. \nOur roads are becoming increasingly unsafe due to poor and haphazard construction, natural disasters. But more often than not, it is because our drivers are overworked, and there is hardly any solid monitoring mechanism in place to check their physical and mental status. Providing resting time for drivers becomes even more crucial during monsoons, when landslides obstruct roads and the journeys become longer.Realising the need to provide drivers with resting time and place, the Lumbini Province Government started building five “smart refresh centres” in Bardaghat in Nawalparasi West, Sainamaina in Rupandehi, Chandrauta in Kapilvastu, Lamahi in Dang, and Bardiya along the East-West Highway four years ago. These centres promise washrooms, eateries, restrooms, shower rooms, charging stations, parking area, among other amenities, to help drivers and passengers tackle fatigue during long-distance travels. However, due to budget constraints, the project hasn’t seen the light of day yet. While the idea of starting the refresh centres is laudable, there is a clear lack of coordination among political parties to complete the project. The ambitious project took shape in Lumbini during the CPN-UML government when it set aside around Rs110 million. But the government was ousted even as it began construction work, and the new government, led by the Maiosts, slashed the budget for the project. The project got shelved by subsequent governments. Even though the first phase of the project (only the construction of the building) has been completed in Sainamaina, its operation has been halted as it lacks proper guidelines for functioning. The experiment in Lumbini has been a failed project.Nepal’s Motor Vehicle and Transport Management Act mandates drivers to rest after six hours of driving. However, the authorities have failed to enforce the rules, let alone arrange proper rest areas for the drivers. Safer roads not only improve road safety but also help the country's tourism flourish. As we strive to expand our tourism agenda by attracting more tourists, the importance of ensuring basic resting facilities along the highways cannot be overstated. Providing the best services for tourists will attract them to the country, thereby boosting our economy and buttressing international reputation. While it is encouraging that several other provinces have rest centres along highways, the conditions are far from decent. Most of these centres lack basic sanitary and hygiene services. Moreover, such small projects lack sufficient construction as well as maintenance funds, as has been the case in Lumbini. The governments’ tendency to consider them “trivial” is equally concerning. Such a mindset not only hinders our journey towards making roads safer but also other opportunities that come along with it, including tourism promotion and passenger satisfaction. As highway accidents become a regular phenomenon in Nepal, we need more smart refresh centres. The federal government should therefore come on board and help provincial and local governments construct these centres through enough budget allocation on need basis. It is also necessary to devise a plan to maintain and renovate existing ones that lack enough amenities for drivers and passengers. Meanwhile, political parties should heed the projects that are in the best interests of people, and not weigh them on the basis of whether they fall under their party’s priority or not. \nLately, road accidents are taking place almost every day. Thousands of people lose their lives in road crashes every year across the country. What are the factors causing these disasters? Why have the authorities failed to prevent them? The Post's Thira Lal Bhusal sat down with former secretary Arjun Jung Thapa, who was director general at the Department of Roads for years, to discuss the pressing issue.Why are road accidents taking place so frequently in Nepal? There is no one reason for road accidents. On the infrastructure front, factors like design, condition and geometry of a road are crucial. Putting sign boards along the roads and giving vital information about the particular location is necessary. Those signs should be placed properly so all driving vehicles and passengers can see them clearly. Some technical aspects, such as whether the superelevation is properly designed, particularly at sharp bends, matter greatly. These must be regularly monitored and corrected in time. Regular vehicle fitness tests are essential. Experienced and disciplined drivers are equally important to ensure road safety. Some accidents occur when drivers are unfamiliar with the roads. For instance, the accident that took place at Anbukhaireni of Tanahun district on Friday, killing 27 Indian nationals, might have been because of the driver’s lack of familiarity with the road condition. Yet another serious concern is the lack of road discipline. Those who come to Nepal with years-long experience of driving abroad fear driving because of motorists' reckless driving and lack of lane discipline. The recent accident at Jadibuti, killing one scooter rider, could have been avoided if proper lane discipline had been followed. Reckless driving by motorcyclists has remained a big problem in our case. So, a separate lane should be designated for bikers. Similarly, lanes should be designated for vehicles based on their speed. But such rules are never followed seriously in our case. Traffic police have been entrusted with enforcing traffic rules but lack the human resources to enforce them effectively. We need an integrated and centrally controlled digital traffic light management system. We had experimented with a system as a trial for some time after 2015. We called a bid but couldn’t accept anyone as the bidders proposed more than the rate we had fixed. The project collapsed, and that system could never be revived. We badly lack technology in this sector. When we try to import technology, brokers get involved and ruin the entire process. The condition of roads built haphazardly, mainly in the hills, is another major concern. What do you say about that?We have built around 80,000 kilometres of road across the country. Of that, only around 14,000 kilometres fall under the jurisdiction of the road department. The rest of the road sections fall under the jurisdiction of various authorities, such as the Department of Local Infrastructure and provincial and local governments. The busiest roads are those under the Department of Roads. They are highways and regional roads. Only 50 percent of the roads overseen by the Department of Roads are blacktopped and are not maintained properly. Of the remaining 65,000 kilometres of road, only 4,000 kilometres are blacktopped. This means that the road condition across the country is poor and must be upgraded. The government will now develop the Kakarvitta-Gorusinghe section of the East-West Highway as a safe demonstration corridor. There will be proper infrastructure for crossings, grade-separated intersections, controlled entries, fencing for the safety from wild animals and crossings for wildlife. Local vehicles will run on service lanes. If it is developed as planned, it would be on par with Asian standards. Other roads in the pipeline will follow these standards. These criteria are being implemented while upgrading the Nagdhunga-Mugling road section as well. We have miles to go to upgrade our roads to international standards. Why are we failing to make quality roads?We can’t build our roads according to the original design. At times, locals obstruct road construction and force us to change the alignments. Then, we have to build them based on the availability of the land.Are our rural roads fit from the engineering perspective?Around 35,000 kilometers out of the 65,000 kilometers of roads that don’t fall under the jurisdiction of the Department of Roads are built randomly. Local leaders, influential individuals, and bulldozer operators fix the alignments of such roads.How can we rectify the malpractices in this sector?We need to activate the National Road Safety Council urgently. Officials from all the concerned departments and representatives from various stakeholders should sit together in this body and find solutions. Also, coordination has become more complicated in the federal system. For instance, highways are under federal jurisdiction, transport management on highways falls under provincial authority, while road management is under federal jurisdiction. Therefore, an effective coordinating body has become a must. Otherwise, we can’t control the increasing trend of deaths in road accidents. At least 1,700 people lost their lives in 2013, and the then government set a target to reduce it by at least 50 percent by 2020. Instead, the yearly death toll has crossed 2,800 now.While it takes years to complete road upgrading tasks, construction materials are left unmanaged and scattered, making driving along the road very difficult and dangerous. Can’t such things be improved?Contractors are powerful because of their political connection with influential leaders including prime ministers and ministers. Civil servants can’t be assertive when the contractors get political protection. At times, they try to use force to coerce government officials. If the situation is not going in their favour, they provoke locals with a plan to get extension in their contract citing local unrest. Experts say that the government is also to blame as it doesn’t carry out development projects properly. Do you agree?I worked for three decades in government agencies until a few months ago. What I found is that one government devises specific policies, plans and initiates certain projects but successive governments stop them. The new leadership starts its own plans and projects. Then, the contractors don’t get their payment. This is the other side of the story. Another problem is that our ministers, lawmakers and leaders show interest in the projects that deserve the least priority while important projects don’t get attention. For instance, around 30 kilometers of Arniko Highway, which connects Nepal with China, has been badly damaged. This is a very important road for the country. Can’t the government repair and maintain a 30-kilometer section of a highway? It requires just around Rs3 billion whereas leaders have allocated over Rs11.5 billion in the projects of personal interests of leaders. Around Rs4 billion has been allocated under lawmakers’ constituency development programmes and additional Rs5 billion has been earmarked for local bridges. We have allocated around Rs60 billion for non-important projects but we have ignored a crucial road, Arniko Highway, which was built with the support of our neighbour China in the 1960s. Thus we have given unnecessary importance where it doesn’t deserve while ignoring vital development projects. The road accidents are directly or indirectly linked to the government’s wrong policies and plans.Development projects are sometimes said to have failed due to rivalry between some leaders. Do you have any such experience?I will give you an example. In the Biratnagar-Bathnaha cross-border rail project, we had to build over 13 kilometers of the railway. It was around four to five years ago. We cleared over 11 kilometers but locals protested in the remaining section where a station was planned. The locals obstructed work there even as 85 percent of the money for land acquisition had already been distributed. Later, we found that the then minister Aman Lal Modi had provoked the locals to demand for additional money. He demanded a ‘special rate for his men’. But the laws don’t allow it.Some experts argue that to upgrade the quality of our roads, we need to make this sector competitive and, for that, we have to allow the private sector to develop projects. Is it viable?The government is hindering the private sector from entering into this business. They don’t invest without assured returns. They need roads like Kathmandu-Tarai Expressway. The government called for proposals in the build-operate-transfer (BOT) model for this project. They were interested. But the government simultaneously allowed a company to build the Kathmandu-Tunnel Road in the same area. Then the investors felt a risk to invest there. But, the company couldn’t continue the tunnel project. Private sector should be welcomed in this sector but we should create a conducive environment for that. Bangladesh and India have built infrastructure projects under the BOT model. We can do it as well.What do you think about the jurisdictional dispute over the New Road stretch between the Kathmandu Metropolis and the Department of Roads? Who should maintain this road?All the roads within the metropolis fall under the local government’s jurisdiction, as the constitution clearly states. The federal department is managing the roads with the understanding that the local governments are not efficient at maintaining them for now. If a local unit wants to maintain a certain road section on its own, the department should allow it without any dispute. Both sides showed childish behaviour while handling the New Road case. \nCPN (Unified Socialist) leader Ram Kumari Jhakri was among the most active leaders involved in the formation of the party after split with the CPN-UML in 2021. Three years on, she is now the most vocal leader calling for a unification of the two parties. Why didn’t the new party perform well, and what made her lobby for a party merger? Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal sat with former minister Jhakri for more insights.You worked actively to form the CPN (Unified Socialist), but the party couldn’t perform well. It couldn’t even become a national party from the general elections. What went wrong?We formed the CPN (Unified Socialist) out of compulsion. When Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli—who was prime minister at the time as well—dissolved the House of Representatives in December 2020, we firmly stood against his move, saying that it sowed the seeds of political instability. We staged huge protests and moved the Supreme Court against the decision of Oli, our party chair at the time. I was among the petitioners. Once the top court reinstated the House, we expected the party to move smoothly. Unfortunately, that couldn’t happen. The party establishment led by Oli and the rival faction took extreme actions against each other. The agitating faction announced action against the party chair, and the party establishment expelled us from the party itself. When Oli dissolved the House a second time, we protested the move as it brought instability. We were in favour of transforming the party through intra-party struggle, but the situation took some unexpected turns. We didn’t quit the party with a lofty plan of making a new revolutionary organisation. We were compelled to do so.Our new party accommodated many genuine leaders who had been sidelined in the UML. But ultimately, old leaders heavily dominated the new party’s central committee. They were active leaders of their time but were out of touch with the new, changing context. Young leaders didn’t get space in party committees. I proposed recruiting at least 40 percent members under 40 years in the central committee and over 50 percent members under 30 years in the district committees. I made a 29-year-old leader the chair of the district committee in my home district. In 42 days, I attended 36 district conventions where youths in their 30s were elected district committee chairs. I tried to reach out to municipalities to promote youths in the party chapters. But at the central level, old faces dominated party committees. That didn’t attract people to the party or impress the general public. Thus, it failed to gather steam right from the beginning.Many think that Madhav Kumar Nepal’s selection as party chief was a wrong move since he had led the UML for 15 years and become prime minister, and people didn’t find novelty in the new party. Do you think so too?Madhav Kumar Nepal has been the most active leader in the party since its inception. Whatever the party has achieved so far is because of him. But a party leader must mobilise teams with defined roles and responsibilities and continuously motivate and engage them in result-oriented tasks. He works a lot but doesn’t mobilise teams effectively. Observers say the Unified Socialist was formed due to the personality clash between top leaders and that it lacked a national agenda and a clear policy to prove the need for a new party. Do you feel so?Our immediate agenda was safeguarding the constitution and ensuring political stability in the country. We protested the House dissolution guided by the same policy. But when provincial governments were made like satellites of the federal government, we couldn’t play any role in stabilising them.The UML is guided by the policy of People’s Multiparty Democracy, propounded by the late Madan Bhandari. There was a debate on further enhancing the policy in the changed context. A large section of Left intellectuals were interested in contributing to that. We could have engaged them in the process. But our party stopped the debate on that topic as well. We missed the chance of engaging many critical individuals in the discourse and having a relatively different policy. When in the UML, we practised direct elections of party representatives and leaders from the conventions. Unfortunately, leaders of the new party, Unified Socialist, made a statute that gave powers to the party leadership to nominate party secretariat, office bearers and other members. Leaders would pick those who are loyal to them. This regressive approach killed competition in the party.You are known to prefer a more proactive work and decision-making approach. There are rumours that you have been fed up with the party’s lacklustre style and are mulling to join the mother party, UML.If I were to decide only from a personal perspective, I would have done so much earlier because I had multiple opportunities in the past. But I am for party merger because I don’t see any relevance of running multiple retail shops under communist banners because we are not substantially different from each other in terms of policies. Our electoral system has also made it necessary. The Unified Socialist can’t run like this. We must accept reality and decide—merging our party with the UML is better than running it this way. But it seems that the top leaders of the twin parties are still bitter about each other.True, the bitterness lingers on, mainly among the top leaders. We have also made some mistakes. The UML offered some opportunities to the Unified Socialist, and we should have made some offers to capitalise on the favourable situation. At one time, UML leaders proposed our party chair as a candidate for the vacant post of the country’s President. We should have devised our own proposal and made a win-win deal. But we ran away and squandered the opportunity. If Madhav Kumar Nepal had become president on the UML’s proposal, our party might have been reunited with the UML much earlier. I also took an initiative to that end but in vain. Later also, UML chair Oli visited our party chair’s residence to have our party on board the government. But the reaction from our side ruined things. We are certainly not responding to the UML responsibly. Rather than irritate the UML, we must turn each positive gesture into an opportunity for party unity.One more factor is blocking the unity between the two parties. There are a large number of second-rung leaders in the UML who can’t directly confront Oli. They are now encouraging former President Bidya Devi Bhandari to join active politics and trying to make decisions in their favour through her. Oli knows these leaders will support Nepal when he returns to the UML. Why would he [Oli] then merge the fringe party and create another power centre against himself? He knows Madhav Kumar Nepal will challenge him with the backing of the dissidents. It is natural for a leader to think twice before allowing another leader of your stature to create a parallel power centre within the organisation. Even I would have thought twice. This is a major factor hindering party unity.Your party chair and other key leaders seem quite close to CPN (Maoist Centre) chair Pushpa Kamal Dahal and critical of UML chair Oli. Moreover, Oli often lambasts Madhav Kumar Nepal publicly. Will they still merge the parties?In principle, our party is open for unity with any Left party. But party cadres won’t join the Maoist Centre. If our leadership decides to merge the party with the Maoists, a huge number of our party cadres will join the UML. Unity between the UML and the Unified Socialist is natural because we grew up in the same background and orientation. But we are quite different from Maoists. Several groups trying to form new political outfits have failed to emerge as a major political force and sustain themselves. You worked in a big party for years and also helped establish a new one. What are the challenges of forming a new political organisation in Nepal?Political parties sustain if they evolve with society. If you trace the history of the Nepal’s Congress and communist parties, you will see how they have evolved over the past seven decades. They competed against each other but joined hands to fight autocratic forces towards establishing democracy. They have done hundreds of progressive things in society. Their major fault is that they have multiple entry points but no exit policy. The only exit way is the death of the leaders. This has caused unhealthy practices and created dissident groups.The dissidents who didn’t get any space within their party formed new outfits. They also amplified negative narratives against the old parties. It happened with the Congress, the UML and the Maoist Centre. Had there been an exit system in the party, the situation wouldn’t be this bad. But new political parties can’t sustain without their own political ideology and orientation. You may form an organisation, cash in on people’s frustration and achieve some immediate gains, but outfits can’t sustain.But recent electoral trends show that Nepalis are seeking alternative forces and new faces. Can we be oblivious to that?You are right. We have seen such trends in the Panchayat system as well. But garnering votes during elections for one term and establishing a sustainable political force are two different things.  \nThe CPN (Maoist Centre) has either led or been a part of the government for most of the past decade and half. But the most recent Maoist Centre-led government under Pushpa Kamal Dahal was ousted only last month. Following this, the party’s senior leaders are in marathon meetings. The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal asked Giriraj Mani Pokharel, the Maoist Centre deputy general secretary, on the party’s review of the turn of events and its future strategy. The Maoist Centre is now out of the government. How does the party intend to go forward? We have started a series of party meetings to review the overall situation and to set the party’s agenda. We held a meeting of the office bearers that ran for five days. Now the party’s standing committee meeting is underway. After this, there will be a central committee meeting. That will take the final decisions on the party’s strategy and programmes for the coming days. In the meetings, the party chair has asked the leaders to discuss national as well as party issues frankly and honestly. At the end of the meeting, we will make an objective analysis of the overall situation and prepare an action plan.The Central Committee endorses the decisions. But the meetings of the office bearers and standing committee set the agenda and orientation for the party. What have you decided so far? On the national front, obviously, the dissolution of our government and formation of a new alliance is an issue. Leaders of the new coalition have said their alliance is for making changes in the constitution. They however are still not transparent. Based on their statements, it can be said that they are going against their own pledges. During the election campaign, they had said nothing about changing the constitution. You don’t find it in their manifestos as well. But in the middle of this five-year tenure, they have come up with a new agenda. A question arises: Can they change the constitution? Doesn’t that violate the mandate the parties got through the elections? Generally, the constitution might be reviewed after 10 years of its implementation. But we haven’t implemented it in a full-fledged way as we don’t even have all the laws required for its effective implementation. We have just agreed to conclude the remaining tasks of the peace process. So, the proposal to amend the constitution without first completing the basics required for its implementation is wrong. They want to make changes in the proportional inclusive system of our constitution. A political force can work to secure a majority in the House through general elections and ensure stability in the country. We accept that. We have also been lobbying for a directly elected executive president for political stability. They are not ready to debate on that. But they want to revoke the inclusive system, a major achievement of the 2006 people’s movement. This system has empowered historically excluded and deprived communities. We have to enhance the capacity of these groups instead of depriving them of their rights. If there are anomalies in the system’s implementation, let’s develop methods to more effectively pick our representatives. But the ruling parties seem intent on turning back the clock. Some leaders have publicly announced that they want to end the role of small parties. There can be a number of political parties in a country like Nepal, which is rich in social diversity. We adopted federalism for the same purpose. The leaders give priority to their family members and loyal ones while selecting election candidates and blame the constitution for the ensuing mistakes. They want to rule the country indefinitely through a two-party system. So we think the Congress-UML alliance is on the path of regression. Republicanism, federalism, secularism, inclusion and socialism-oriented systems are integrated five pillars of the present constitution. No attack on them will be tolerated. This is one focus of our ongoing meeting. We are also discussing some fresh international issues such as the developments in Bangladesh. We have yet to get a complete picture from there. But we can still learn some things. The centre of global affairs is changing and shifting to Asia. More importantly, there is a strong influence of such geopolitical forces in Nepal as well.Party chair Pushpa Kamal Dahal has said that there was an external hand in the recent change of coalition.External elements are active, in one way or the other. Some want to make our country a playground of external forces but our party and party chair firmly stood against it. The forces that wanted various things but didn’t get them from the government then started searching for a character suitable for them. People aren’t aware of such unseen elements but we should be careful. In the meeting, we are discussing this issue as well.Do you think geopolitics is the major reason for the ouster of the Dahal-led government?In his third term as a prime minister, Prachanda was working with certain priorities such as good governance, social justice and prosperity. He had taken governance seriously. Previously, there was a practice of exploiting state coffers in collusion between politicians, big businessmen and bureaucrats. The Prachanda-led government strongly stood against such a nexus. Actions against those involved in Bhutanese refugee scam, Lalita Niwas land grab, Bansbari Leather Shoe land scam, and gold smuggling are some examples. The government formulated a law to address the problems of loan shark victims. But some individuals associated with the coalition partners were involved in the scams. Were these bad elements linked to the Congress or the UML? Dahal entered into coalitions with both.The individuals were linked to partners in both the coalitions. The party chair made good governance his main priority but the Maoist Centre is the third-largest party so his hands were tied. When certain individuals were brought under investigation in corruption cases, the initiatives to change the government were expedited overnight. We can conclude that Prachanda government’s anti-corruption moves inspired other parties to oust it.You mentioned external interference as well as other parties’ fear of the government’s anti-corruption actions. Which one was the major reason for government change?The government’s anti-corruption drive is the main reason behind the formation of the new coalition. This drive brought the two largest parties together to form a government, which is unusual in the parliamentary system. The government is working to increase the threshold to secure seats under the proportional representation category. The proposed provision is against small parties, and the Maoist Centre has opposed this. Do you see the possibility of polarisation among the parties on this issue?When the ruling parties introduce new proposals that were not even discussed during the elections, we will definitely oppose them. We led the previous movements for people’s rights and we have to secure these rights. Thus the polarisation between those who want to trample on the statute and those who are against such attacks is inevitable. Is the Maoist Centre preparing to unify with other parties including the Nepal Communist Party led by Netra Bikram Chand Biplab?First, we are in the final stage of merging with the outfit of Mahindra Raya Yadav. Also, the Biplab-led party has endorsed the party unity proposal. We have to iron out some theoretical issues and make the party line clear in the changed national as well as international context. Dialogue between us is headed in the right direction.You earlier said party chair has urged other leaders to openly debate issues. Have they discussed why the Maoist party has lost its strength as well as the issue of the party chair holding leadership continuously for three and a half decades.Comrade Prachanda led the decade-long people’s war and subsequent political movements as well as the peace process, all of which made epochal changes in Nepal’s political history. No one can deny this. Therefore, Prachanda doesn’t need any position in the party. He is now a nationally as well as internationally established personality. But our party as well as the country needs him. Therefore, the discussions in the party are now aimed at making the best use of his personality in the larger interest of the society. As far as the reasons behind the setbacks we faced in the recent time are concerned, we had rightly assessed the situation in the past.But we couldn’t adapt to the changed context. We failed to develop our culture and lifestyle in line with our guiding ideology. Similarly, we failed to run the party in a proper way. We gave up our agendas and became power-centric. We developed anti-proletariat tendencies. We were gradually distanced from the public. Now we have decided that we must reestablish our relations with the working class and the oppressed. We have also failed to communicate about the important works we did when we were in the government. We need to tell the people what we did in their favour when we were in government in the past 15 years. There will also be some serious soul-searching.There is a perception that the Maoist Centre and its leaders are incapable of staying out of power.Our party’s general convention had decided to maintain a right balance in the party’s role in the government, Parliament and the street. It is true that we were in the past more engaged in the government. The party chair has already said that our focus won’t be the government from now on. \nAjaya Dixit’s current work focuses on studying challenges of building resilience across boundaries and at sub-national scales. He has studied and written extensively on water resources, trans-boundary water cooperation, flood management, wash services and climate change adaptation, clean energy transition and related policy studies. In this interview with the Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal, Dixit discusses river management in Nepal’s urban areas: Where have we gone wrong in this endeavour and what can we do? You have extensively studied river systems and have been following changes seen in river basins. How do you see recent problems caused by encroachment and rampant development activities?We humans have lived and have to continue to live within water cycles: water evaporates from the ocean to the sky and then precipitates to the land and flows via rivers back to the ocean. Rivers that function as arteries of the land surface, sustaining humans, aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems face widespread abuses: pollution, rampant extraction of their bed and banks, fragmentation and degradation. Without rivers, we would not be who we are. Unfortunately, we have forgotten this essence. We neglect and abuse rivers. In 1981, just after the monsoon ended, I, along with my students, walked from Sundarijal to Teku studying Bagmati rivers’ sediment. At many places, we walked on the riverbed. The river then was clean. Gradually, the river systems began to face all-round decay. I have read painful accounts of my contemporaries who remember swimming in the clean Bagmati and its tributaries. In less than 50 years, our rivers in Kathmandu Valley and other basins no longer look like rivers. I feel helpless and ache with pain at this collective failure! What state of rivers are we passing on to our next generation?River encroachment is common across Nepal but more serious in urban areas, including in Kathmandu. How can this be stopped?Our approach to rivers is an imitation of the trend common across South Asia, or the subcontinent, which is again largely based on the knowledge system developed in the industrialised Global North without contextualising locally. The region features waterscapes of high and punctuated rainfall during the monsoon months, rivers, wetlands, ponds, and springs, all connected with groundwater aquifers in one of the most complex landscapes of the world: the Himalaya-Ganga region. Yet, current development endeavours subjugate water rather than respect and live with it. In 2022, the Indus River in Pakistan faced major floods with devastating consequences. Referring to these floods, a group of global scientists stated that “the impacts [of the floods] were the outcome of an outdated river management system.” This approach is primarily based on building of physical structures such as buildings, bridges and roads close to rivers interfering with their natural flows. The approach that began in the early twentieth century keeps marching on even while we are facing twenty first century water challenges.There is an increasing trend of building corridor roads along the rivers in Kathmandu as well as other places. Is this a good or bad practice? In Nepal, road building in the hills has earned the sobriquet of “dozer roads,” meaning politically designed roads excavated by heavy machine operators without adhering to basic engineering, social, environmental, or hydrological safeguards. Even highways built with “engineering,” such as the Mugling-Narayanghat section, face regular accidents. The sliding of the two buses in the Trishuli is the recent example. Building roads along the banks of rivers, defined as “river corridors,” is the preferred approach for improving connectivity. In the Kathmandu Valley, this is also associated with rivers shackled within concrete walls in the name of river beautification. In the monsoon, however, they all overflow as we have been seeing in the last few years and this year as well.What will happen to these rivers 10-15 years down the line? Is there any chance of some of our rivers dying? Or, will the measures taken in recent times protect them?All rivers must flow clean and free in selected stretches. But today, rivers are disconnected with their floodplains. Within walls and embankments, they have become conduits of filth. Many rivers are already seriously degraded. If the current trend continues, many rivers may die. I remember Jacques-Yves Cousteau, the French oceanographer, filmmaker, and author, who wrote: “Water and air, the two essential fluids on which all life depends, have become global garbage cans.” Our current efforts at conserving, developing and managing rivers are grossly inadequate. During the Covid-19 pandemic, we saw some rivers heal as human actions across the board ceased due to the lockdown. But this healing came at huge human and economic costs. The lessons, however, are clear. We must stop turning rivers into garbage cans for them to begin to heal. The onus lies on us, our activities, our governance, and the policies we make and put into practice effectively. We need new ways of imagining rivers in harmony with human needs. Otherwise, the rivers will die. If rivers die, what will become of us?What problems may city dwellers face as a result of this continued destruction of rivers?A 2020 analysis of rivers in Nepal found that the quality of rivers in the mid-hills and the Tarai are already deteriorating. Industries, cities, towns, and agriculture produce waste that, when disposed of in rivers untreated, cause pollution. Solid and liquid wastes produced by expanding cities and towns pollute nearby rivers, streams, and water bodies. Pollution kills aquatic life such as fish, which are sources of livelihood for many communities. Polluted rivers and water bodies degrade human and environmental health, leading to negative impacts on human livelihoods. The impacts of pollution on rivers are considerable during non-monsoon months when river discharge, and consequently the capacity of rivers to dilute waste, are low.What should be done to conserve the rivers, at least in the present form, and stop further damages?All rivers are a combination of water (W), energy (E), biodiversity aquatic (B), and sediment (S), represented by the acronym WEBS. In the current scheme of things, the focus is on water and energy. Aquatic ecosystems are the concern of only those working on freshwater ecosystems. They are neglected in the larger context though the state has made some provisions for conserving ecosystems. In Nepal’s Hydropower Development Policy of 2001 all hydropower plants must release 10 percent minimum flow to the downstream reaches to enable fish and other aquatic life to survive in the river. A 2021 study of 50 hydropower plants however found that none of the plants surveyed release environmental-flows. All hydropower plants, as per their power purchasing agreements, are required to produce maximum power during the dry season. We should start by accepting the fact that rivers need clean flowing water and respecting the policies we have made. Then we must systematically introduce changes and avoid the oversights embedded in the present approach. The present approach to water development and management focused on engineering and structural solutions is based on single-disciplinary education that is blind to gender and social inclusion challenges and aquatic ecosystems. In the present approach, nobody seems to want sediment which is a natural consequence of flow within the water cycle.To meet such an objective, we need to begin with a system of integrated knowledge that synthesises natural science, social science, and indigenous practices. By incorporating fields such as hydrology, ecology, social science-supported context-specific engineering, and indigenous knowledge and practices, we can take a comprehensive approach to water management challenges and solutions. Interdisciplinary approaches can build collaboration, innovation, and systemic decision-making and promote innovative water management for the benefit of both ecosystems and human societies.Do you think initiatives such as river clean up campaigns run by various groups help protect these waterways?I see such initiatives as manifestation of dissatisfaction of concerned citizens with the degradation of rivers and to bring about changes. In 1990, I was part of the Save Bagmati Campaign, which aimed to highlight the degrading state of the river. This campaign has taken many new forms, and citizen groups have begun campaigns in other rivers of Nepal. They however remain fragmented and ad-hoc. Similar campaigns in some countries have led to granting rights to rivers. In 2017, New Zealand recognised the Whanganui River and its tributaries as legal entities, acknowledging their physical and spiritual significance as “living and indivisible” and ensuring their survival, health, and integrity to balance the needs of humans and nature. Promulgations like Living Indus (Pakistan), Namami Gange river-improvement programme (India) can offer lessons for a holistic water journey. The collective voice of concerned citizens for the integrity of rivers can be a powerful medium for policy and pathway changes. Nepal must also begin country-wide river restoration initiatives. We need more dialogue and conversation around water challenges and solutions.As cities turn into concrete jungles, their water tables are said to be receding alarmingly. You often propose redesigning our settlements and development infrastructure in a way that wouldn’t disturb rivers’ natural courses and catchment areas. Could you elaborate?South Asia is a region of waterscapes containing streams, ponds, wetlands, open spaces, floodplains, springs, and underground aquifers. Yet, our towns, cities, and infrastructure are planned, designed, and built to disregard water rather than live with it. As land-centric urban growth dominates, waterscapes temporarily seem to vanish but later water comes back. In Nepali we have a saying “In twelve years a stream returns”. The present practice of urban development is obsessed with concretisation, making these areas impermeable. Rainwater, part of which would naturally infiltrate the ground, now immediately reaches the rivers already constrained by walls. The river at a downstream section immediately peaks and when the rainfall stops the river has very low discharge. Basic parameters, like the intensity of rainfall (mm per hour), are poorly recognised and used in design guidelines. The interaction of current urbanisation practices and increasing extreme rainfall, temperature and humidity rise spawned by climate change and urban heat island effects will make our urban areas as crucible of hazards, and unhealthy. A new urban future must harmoniously integrate nature, including water bodies and wetlands, and preserve natural land cover, including traditional ponds to promote groundwater recharge. It can be further achieved by preserving green open spaces, forests, gardens, permeable “sponge” pavements, and natural waterfronts for healthier communities in sustainable cities. The starting point will be recognising cities as waterscapes. Amplified mitigation of emissions of greenhouse gases at global levels remains a critical imperative in this new future. The major impacts of climate change are evident through the water cycle. Squatters settled along the riverbanks are taken as one of the major headaches in preserving rivers’ catchment areas. How can this issue be resolved?The squatters and migrants to urban regions are outcomes of the present-day political economy of development. People move to cities seeking livelihood, education, and opportunities to move up the social ladder. These groups who end up living in high-risk areas are sometimes also seen as political vote banks. This issue needs to be viewed within the larger development question including generation of local employment, new livelihood opportunities and addressing insecurities of water, food, health, and education.Recently the Supreme Court asked authorities to make septic tank and soak pit mandatory while approving building designs in order to help recharge groundwater, and a recent Cabinet meeting has banned building any structure within 40 metres on both sides of major rivers in Kathmandu, Do such measures help keep the rivers alive or is that too little too late?Such decisions, in some way, seem to underscore the notion of giving space to rivers and maintaining their integrity. Building of septic tanks as part and parcel of new houses began in the 1970s as primary treatment units that can prevent the direct dumping of human waste into rivers and water bodies. The regular cleaning and safe disposal of waste from septic tanks are emerging questions. Rivers and waterscapes face much deeper challenges, however. The present water development model marches on like a mighty tusker, trampling in its path communities, villagers, residents, natural ecosystems, the terrestrial and aquatic beings, and past memories. Turning that around will require those working on water and river integrity across geographical, social, disciplinary and political boundaries to join hands in seeking changes and laying the foundation for a new ethical social contract for rivers and waterscapes as a first step in that long journey. \nWithin days of CPN-UML chair KP Sharma Oli and Nepali Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba reaching a deal to form a new government under Oli’s leadership, some Congress leaders including the two party general secretaries started doubting the deal’s implementation. Independent observers also have doubts over the longevity of the Congress-UML partnership. To get some insight, the Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal sat down with Congress Central Committee member Govind Raj Pokharel, who is also former vice-chair of National Planning Commission. Many have expressed doubt over the longevity of the Congress-UML alliance. What is your observation?There was a discussion in the political circles on the need for the Congress and the UML joining hands to address some serious problems the country has been facing for years. The issues of governance, flaws seen in the practice of the electoral system, and the national economy are some pressing issues that need to be addressed. In the meantime, the top leaders of the two largest parties reached a deal overnight. The dramatic turn of events made people suspect some unspoken reasons had brought the leaders of the two rival forces together. The leaders have stated that they joined hands mainly to review the constitution, to make changes in the electoral system, improve governance and address problems seen in the economic sector. These are the stated objectives. As far as my observation goes, people don’t have full faith in the leaders of the two parties because of past records. On the economic front, this coalition may achieve some improvements because both parties are on the same page. Both follow liberal economic ideas. Of late, even the UML has become increasingly liberal on economic issues. The private sector has welcomed the new alliance. There are already some signs of reforms. Their plan to make changes in the electoral system through constitutional amendment however is not easy. First, their numerical strength in the federal parliament, mainly in the upper house, is insufficient to amend the constitution. Such a move would be risky from a strategic perspective as well. Many groups and forces have reservations over various provisions of this constitution. Once they start the amendment process, it will be like opening Pandora’s Box. Thus I am optimistic only on the economic front. If they get that right, it will help address the society’s mass frustration.The two parties have cited the perennial political instability as a major reason behind their coming together. Can we now expect policy consistency as well?Political instability is an excuse to cover up their failures. Even the alliance of largest parties cannot guarantee political or policy stability. Numbers alone are not enough. Leaders also need to have a democratic culture and the capacity to manage emerging issues. Even governments led by a single party commanding up to two-thirds majority have failed. On certain occasions, coalition governments have done commendable jobs. Handling the post-quake situation and producing the constitution in 2015 were examples of big parties justifying their coalition. Thus even with some doubt, we can expect political stability and some economic reforms.The Congress unanimously endorsed the deal of party president Sher Bahadur Deuba and CPN-UML chair KP Sharma Oli. But in public, leaders from the anti-establishment faction of the Congress don’t seem satisfied. Why this unease?The deal was made in a dramatic way without proper consultations with other leaders. At least those in the executive committees of the party should have been consulted. It is challenging for the Congress leaders to ally with their major rival, the UML. A cadre-based party, the UML’s style of governance is different to that of the Congress. When in government, the UML treats even government institutions, constitutional bodies and independent agencies as the party’s structures. Whereas the Congress allows more freedom to government agencies. So, there is a risk of the UML misusing state mechanisms while the Congress leaders are in the Cabinet. This is one big risk for the Congress. The second concern is the working style of Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli. He is a towering personality, a hard-working leader, and with his strong command over his party organisation, he can swiftly implement any proposal. The Congress ministers who also have to listen to the concerns of the party’s top leaders may struggle to strike a balance. In Oli’s Cabinet, ministers are likely to get less freedom within their ministries. A rift is thus likely because of Prime Minister Oli’s working style.Why didn’t the Congress then send influential leaders to the Cabinet to check the prime minister?The leaders might not have been so interested in joining this government. They might have sensed intervention from the prime minister’s office and thought they might not be able to perform as per their expectation under Oli’s leadership. See, chiefs of the Congress, the UML and the Maoist Centre work in a dictatorial way. Once they are elected at the party convention for four years, they behave like dictators. They take decisions on their own without any consultations. People in Nepal often lobby for a directly-elected prime minister or President. I wonder what these leaders would do if they were directly elected as executive head. So, the problem is in the working style and attitude of our leaders, not in the constitution or the electoral system.Shekhar Koirala and Gagan Thapa had first pitched for joining hands with the UML to end ‘unnecessary bargaining’ of fringe parties. Suddenly, Deuba struck the deal with Oli. And, now Koirala and Thapa seem sceptical about the deal.The proposal of Koirala and Thapa was for Congress leading the government and the UML supporting it. In fact, Oli was ready to accept Congress leadership. He requested the Congress leaders to take the lead. Surprisingly, the negotiating team led by our party president reached an opposite deal. They offered government leadership to Oli.Then, could it be that, as some claim, Deuba and his wife Arzu were desperate to unseat Dahal fearing they could be dragged into corruption scams?I don’t know much about that scenario. But what I knew is that Oli was willing to join a Congress-led government.Why would Deuba, who is a very clever leader in making such give-and-take deals, have given up a chance to be prime minister right away?It’s true that all three party chiefs—Deuba, Oli and Dahal—are very clever in making deals in their own favour based on their numerical strength. A leader beats the other two on one occasion and on another, another of them comes out on top. It’s like a see-saw. This time Oli won the game.Congress General Secretaries Gagan Thapa and Bishwa Prakash Sharma have expressed suspicion over the implementation of the deal. Many say they did so as Deuba didn’t involve them in negotiations on power-sharing. Is it true?The party’s central work execution committee endorsed the deal signed by the two leaders. The leaders who participate in such meetings should speak up then and there if there is anything objectionable, instead of making such statements in public. Why didn’t they oppose it at the meeting? I don’t see any point in expressing doubt over the deal in public while endorsing the same in party committees.The two general secretaries also expressed doubt over Oli handing over government leadership to Deuba as per the agreement. Why this mistrust?The experience of the past two or three decades makes politicians suspicious of each other. Nepali politicians have hardly ever handed over government leadership easily. After four or five months of collaboration, some issues emerge and a rift is created. So, history makes us doubt that this coalition will last for three and half years. In the meantime, the party establishments have sidelined other factions when it comes to picking ministers, both at federal and provincial levels. When the government fails to perform as per expectation, party cadres of the ruling parties start criticising the government. Is it possible to amend the constitution as the two parties have announced?We can’t backtrack on the inclusive system. We must abide by the policy of inclusion in state agencies. The leaders who spoiled this system are saying that the proportional representation (PR) system is not working. But there is room to make our three-tier federal system more cost-effective. People get irritated when they see a large number of representatives benefitting from state coffers. We can bring down the number of local units from 753 to around 400. However, there should be sufficient wards as those units are directly involved in service delivery while the Palikas are more engaged in development activities. The number of ward members can also be decreased. In provinces, we don’t need PR seats as those elected from the provincial constituencies automatically represent the local communities. Likewise, the provincial cabinets can be downsized. Thus we can downsize the number of people who benefit from state coffers. This is vital to make the federal system sustainable. Similarly, we can rightsize the number of PR seats by adopting a rotational constituency for women, dalits and other marginalised communities. Only the candidates from underrepresented sections will compete in those constituencies. This will help elect competent people even from within the targeted communities. This is how we can address some concerns without compromising the inclusive system envisioned in the constitution.Why has the Congress picked gangsters and tainted individuals as ministers in provinces?The selection of such controversial individuals as ministers and policy makers will damage the party’s image. People are going to raise this issue seriously. In fact the pace of criminalisation and commercialisation of Nepali politics is faster than the political reform being undertaken to clean up politics.It seems intellectual leaders are being sidelined while gangsters are being promoted. Why is it happening?Because people from intellectual or political backgrounds voice critical views and leaders don’t like it. They speak what their conscience says is right. For instance, leaders like Mahesh Acharya and Minendra Rijal aren’t given any role in the party. It is a common problem in all the major political forces in Nepal.Is the space for leaders with intellectual backgrounds and having critical views being squeezed?The Congress used to be a very liberal organisation. But it has also become illiberal and leaders have become increasingly intolerant. All leaders—whether the seniors or young ones—are becoming less tolerant even of constructive criticism. Party leaders haven’t spoken against the selection of gangsters as ministers. Even the office bearers who are in decision making bodies and can change the decisions are silent now. This is dangerous. This is an example of how critical voices are sidelined.Haven’t the two young general secretaries been able to raise hope in the Congress?They are working like central committee members. General secretaries should be able to intervene while making crucial policy decisions. They can stop the party committees from making wrong decisions. But they are risk-averse. They are not taking the risk to fight the powerful party establishment.Historically, in all parties there is a trend of its anti-establishment faction bargaining for 40-45 percent seats in the party or government. If they don’t get an acceptable power sharing deal, they don’t cooperate with the party leadership. Is it a healthy democratic practice?Intra-party competition compels the leaders to do this. The ruthless establishment always sidelines party members and leaders if they aren’t loyal. So, the leadership of the anti-establishment has to protect such cadres because the rival factor too needs a strong support base of cadres to compete against the powerful establishment. Party establishments are strong due to centralised resources and other factors, so you need an equally strong force to compete against them. \nThe Meteorological Forecasting Division has predicted partly to generally cloudy conditions across the country on Thursday.Light to moderate rain, accompanied by thunder and lightning, is likely in several areas, with a possibility of heavy rainfall in one or two locations within Koshi, Gandaki, Lumbini, and Karnali provinces.Tonight, the hilly regions are expected to remain partly to generally cloudy, while the rest of the country will experience partly cloudy to mainly fair conditions.
