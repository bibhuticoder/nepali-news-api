Write it in the form of inspiring story not news article or event.\n    \n    Story:\nOnce upon a time, nestled between the towering peaks of the Himalayas and the lush jungles of the Terai, there was a country named Nepal. Though still a developing nation, Nepal was a land of profound beauty and deep-rooted cultural heritage. The residents of Nepal faced many challenges, but beneath these hardships lay a resilient spirit and an unyielding hope for the future.\n\nThis enchanting land, where Mount Everest reaches towards the skies and the air carries a mix of incense and cool mountain breezes, was more than a geographical marvel. It was a mosaic of cultures, languages, and traditions, a testament to human endeavor against all odds. Nepal's history, from the unification under King Prithvi Narayan Shah to its transformation into a federal democratic republic, told a story of aspiration and endurance.\n\nIn recent years, the people of Nepal, with their indomitable will, had taken strides towards rebuilding and reimagining their country. They turned their struggles into stepping stones, each challenge a chapter in their ongoing saga. The shift from a monarchy to a republic had not only changed governance but had woven a new tapestry of democratic values and collective decision-making.\n\nEconomically, while agriculture continued to sustain a large part of its population, Nepal had begun to harness the potential of its picturesque landscapes, developing sustainable tourism that promised to preserve their natural heritage while boosting local economies. Communities living in the shadows of the Himalayas had become stewards of the earth, protecting the biodiversity that made their country unique.\n\nEach day brought new stories. Whether it was a festival in Kathmandu, a technological advance in Pokhara, or a conservation effort in Chitwan, these events were threads in the vibrant quilt of Nepali life. These stories, updated daily, reflected the pulse of progress and the spirit of hope that characterized this resilient nation.\n\nAnd so, as Nepal moved forward, each moment was not just a passage of time but a promise of potential, a narrative of a nation perennially climbing towards tomorrow, guided by the legacy of its past and the dreams of its future.\n\nNews events:\nThe erstwhile Pushpa Kamal Dahal government on April 12 constituted a committee led by Om Prakash Mishra, a former chief justice, to nominate candidates to the Truth and Reconciliation Commission and the Commission of Investigation on Enforced Disappeared Persons. While the government picked four members for the committee, the fifth member is either the chairperson of the National Human Rights Commission or someone nominated by him. Initially, the commission had insisted that revision of the Enforced Disappearance Enquiry, Truth and Reconciliation Commission Act was a precondition for its participation in the committee, but following the Act’s amendment, it agreed to join the Mishra panel. However, three weeks after President Ramchandra Paudel authenticated the bill to amend the Act that the federal parliament endorsed, the constitutional human rights watchdog has yet to recommend its representative. Its officials said they are waiting for a formal request from the Ministry of Law, Justice and Parliamentary Affairs, as they expect a new letter in the changed context.“We have been told the ministry would send a new request letter for our representative, given the new context following the amendment to the Act,” said a commission member. The revised Act states that the recommendation committee has two months to make nominations for the chairpersons and members of the two commissions. It has already been five months since the Mishra-led panel was formed. However, a senior official at the law ministry said he does not think a new process needs to start just because the Act has been amended. “The two month countdown began the day the revised Act was enacted,” said the official. “I also don’t think the ministry told the commission that it would send a new request letter. If such a message was conveyed, it may have come from the political level.” Those involved in forging all-party consensus on the amendment say tensions between the CPN-UML and the CPN (Maoist Centre) have stalled the transitional justice process. Relations between the two parties have not been cordial ever since the formation of the new ruling alliance. The UML has consistently referred to the Maoist insurgency as ‘violence’, while the Maoist Centre has warned that the present KP Sharma Oli government could meet the same fate as Sheikh Hasina Wazed, the immediate past prime minister of Bangladesh.“The tussle between the two parties has directly affected the ongoing process,” one leader involved in the negotiations told the Post. “Oli doesn't seem as interested as he was earlier.”The committee was formed in May amid reservations from conflict-era victims of human rights violations and human rights defenders, who demanded that the Act be amended before selecting office bearers. The government, however, argued that forming the committee was necessary as per the Supreme Court’s March 12 order to the government to select office bearers for the two commissions within a month.The court had asked the government to constitute task forces within the commissions to conduct preliminary investigations into the victims’ complaints until the office bearers were appointed.Following the court’s order, the victims and human rights defenders demanded the government and the parties endorse the legal amendments by the top court’s deadline before starting the selection process. However, the amendment bill couldn’t be endorsed within the deadline, prompting the government to form a committee based on existing law.Following the committee’s formation, the victims and human rights defenders requested the government to halt the selection process until the Act was amended. They also urged the national rights watchdog to hold off on sending its representative.The two commissions have been defunct since July 2022, when the government decided to extend their terms without retaining their chairmen and members. The government claimed the bill to amend the transitional justice law would be endorsed by October 2022, and the appointments made based on the revised Act.But it took over two years for the federal parliament to endorse the bill. The victims and human rights defenders are closely watching who will be appointed to the commissions.The Truth Commission has received 63,718 complaints, while the commission on disappearances is sitting on around 2,400 cases. The new teams will have four years to accomplish their tasks, though there are provisions for their extension. The commissions that were formed in 2015 have done nothing other than collect complaints and conduct preliminary investigations on some of them.  \nAlong with dengue infection, major hospitals in the Kathmandu Valley are seeing a significant surge in cases of viral fever, flu, typhoid, and seasonal influenza in recent days.Doctors attending to the patients said that the number of fever cases has risen compared to previous months, with some patients even developing pneumonia and requiring inpatient care due to worsening health.“Around 50 percent of the patients who come to the outpatient department at our hospital are fever cases,” said Dr Rita Hamal, a consultant paediatrician at the Chabahil-based Om Hospital and Research Centre. “Some children have also been diagnosed with pneumonia and have been admitted at the hospital for inpatient care.”Experts say the rise in fever and cold before weather transitions is concerning and that the spread of the virus could be behind the surge in infection rates.They say the influenza virus causes respiratory complications, which affect the lungs. The virus spreads quickly in communities. These diseases can cause fever, cough, body aches, occasional vomiting, diarrhoea, and pneumonia.Doctors say that while the number of new cases of fever and flu has risen significantly, the exact cause of the surge still remains unclear. Many patients do not opt for various diagnostic tests, and health workers also provide symptomatic care first.“There is no specific care for viral infections, including dengue,” said Hamal. “We provide symptomatic care only. So we do not know the actual cause of the ailments.”Doctors recommend multiple tests only for patients with serious health conditions. They say that early diagnosis is crucial for preventing infection, and patients recover quickly if treated in time. However, according to experts, the severity of the disease and the number of deaths increase if seasonal influenza cases are not diagnosed promptly.“We don’t know the actual cause of the surge in fever, flu, and other ailments,” said Dr Sumit Agrawal, spokesperson at the Kanti Children Hospital. “Almost all hospital beds have been occupied by ailing patients, and the number of fever cases has risen significantly recently.”The hospital, which also serves as the national referral centre for ailing children, said that over 1,200 children seek care daily, and 30 to 40 percent of them are fever and flu cases.Doctors at Sukraraj Tropical and Infectious Disease Hospital and Patan Hospital also said that the number of fever and flu cases has risen significantly of late.“Along with dengue cases, the number of people suffering from viral fever, flu, typhoid and other infections has increased at our hospital as well,” said Dr Yuba Nidhi Basaula, director at the Sukraraj Tropical and Infectious Disease Hospital in Teku, Kathmandu. “Most of the beds in our hospital have been occupied. The number of dengue infection cases has also surged lately.”Doctors at Patan Hospital said that in addition to fever cases, patients with diarrhoeal infections and other water-borne diseases are also seeking care. They expect more cases in the coming days, as fever and flu cases usually spike during weather transitions.Even though fever and flu cases are rising significantly, authorities remain unaware of the exact cause of the surge in infection rates.“When the cause of ailments is not ascertained, it becomes difficult to provide effective care,” said Dr Sher Bahadur Pun, chief of the Clinical Research Unit at Sukraraj Hospital. “The number of people infected with influenza could be several times higher than those seeking care at hospitals, as many people suffering from influenza-like illness do not seek treatment unless they become serious.”A recent report by the Nepal Statistics Office also shows that cold and fever remain a significant concern, with an increase from 43.7 percent in 1995/96 to 51. 5 percent in 2022/23.Doctors say more people get infected with viruses during seasonal changes, as most viruses—adenovirus, rhinovirus, influenza virus, and even coronavirus—become active during these times, particularly in winter.However, they say this does not mean respiratory viruses do not spread at other times. People are continuously infected with respiratory viruses in other seasons as well, and those with weak immunity could become more severely affected by infections.Doctors urge everyone to take precautions against these risks and ask authorities to step up surveillance to determine the real causes of influenza-like illnesses. \nThe coalition government of the CPN-UML and the Nepali Congress has reiterated its commitment to review the achievements made and weaknesses observed in the course of implementing the constitution in the past nine years.The two ruling parties have pledged to amend the constitution based on a broader understanding made through discussions, dialogues and consultations with political parties, civil society, intelligentsia, constitutional experts and the public.The parties have said such amendments will be made mainly based on the findings of the review and experiences of implementing it. Moreover, the parties said that establishing political stability in the country would be the major objective of the amendment.The two ruling parties made the commitments in the common minimum programme of the government, which was submitted to Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli and Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba on Wednesday evening. The parties had earlier formed a four-member panel to draft the government’s programme based on a seven-point agreement reached between the Congress and the UML in the first week of July. Party general secretary Gagan Thapa and spokesperson Prakash Sharan Mahat from Congress, and party deputy general secretaries Pradeep Gyawali and Bishnu Rimal from the CPN-UML were tasked to prepare the document. They jointly submitted the document to the two party chiefs and made it public.“The achievements of the 2006 movement and the fundamental pillars of this constitution including federal, republic and inclusive governance system will be further institutionalised and strengthened,” the document says.The seven-page document is divided into eight subtitles—safeguarding national interest and independent foreign policy; protection, implementation and amendment of the constitution; good governance and quality service delivery; dynamic economy and development; ensuring social justice and fundamental rights; youth partnership; transitional justice, sustainable peace and social harmony; and miscellaneous.The coalition has pledged to set up a high-powered cooperative regulatory body as per the recommendation of the parliamentary inquiry committee to address the problems seen in the cooperative sector.“Taking action against those involved in misusing funds from cooperatives, the return of depositors’ money will be ensured,” the common minimum programme states.The ruling parties have pledged to punish corrupt people irrespective of the individuals’ power and positions. On the economic front, the coalition has vowed to expedite generation and transmission of hydroelectricity and further intensify the electrification process. \nOman snatched a dramatic one-wicket victory over Nepal in a thrilling encounter during the ICC Men’s Cricket World Cup League 2 match in King City, Canada on Wednesday, chasing down a 221-run target with just one ball to spare.After being put in to bat, Nepal struggled to build momentum early on. The opening pair of Arjun Saud (5) and Aasif Sheikh (11) fell cheaply, leaving Nepal in trouble at 22-2 in the 11th over. Bhim Sharki (11) also departed soon after, further slowing down Nepal’s progress.Captain Rohit Paudel anchored the innings with a solid 60 off 72 balls, stabilising the innings after the early collapse. He received support from Aarif Sheikh (35 off 88), who played a patient knock, ensuring the team reached a respectable total.The turning point of Nepal’s innings came when Gulsan Jha walked to the crease. Jha blasted 53 off just 35 balls, including five sixes and three boundaries, lifting Nepal to 220-9 by the end of their 50 overs.Oman’s bowlers were disciplined, with Kaleemullah (2-39) and Fayyaz Butt (2-36) leading the attack. Aqib Ilyas and Shoaib Khan chipped in with two and one wicket respectively, while Shakeel Ahmed was the most economical, conceding just 29 runs in his 10 overs.In response, Oman made a strong start, with openers Kashyap Prajapati (36 off 52) and Jatinder Singh (41 off 49) laying a solid foundation. Their partnership for the first wicket gave Oman the platform to chase the target comfortably. However, Nepal’s spinners brought them back into the game. Legspinner Sandeep Lamichhane trapped Jatinder Singh LBW, while Gulsan Jha spun magic with his five-wicket haul, dismissing Aqib Ilyas (29), Ayaan Khan (9), Shoaib Khan (26), and Fayyaz Butt (8), leaving Oman in a precarious position at 198-8.Shakeel Ahmed, batting at number nine, held his ground with an unbeaten 17 off 24 balls. Jay Odedra was dismissed for 5, but Kaleemullah’s crucial 6 not out, alongside Ahmed, took Oman across the finish line in the final over.Gulsan Jha was the standout performer for Nepal, taking 5-47 in his 10 overs to go along with his half-century. Despite his all-round heroics, Nepal couldn’t prevent Oman from securing a thrilling win. \nThe fate of four proposed ambassadors, who are being vetted by the parliamentary hearing special committee, hangs in the balance.The parliamentary committee has completed the hearing of 17 envoy nominees but its members are divided over four proposed names—Shankar Sharma (India), Kapil Shrestha (South Africa), Dhan Prasad Pandit (Israel) and Netra Prasad Timilsina (Malaysia)—and are undecided.A meeting of the hearing committee, which was scheduled for Wednesday, has been deferred till Thursday owing to the differences over the four nominees, according to committee member Shyam Ghimire.The committee had received complaints against Sharma, Shrestha, Pandit and Timilsina; and the committee itself has reservations over the nominees, said a lawmaker. Sharma, Shrestha and Pandit were recommended under the quota of Nepali Congress and Timilsina under CPN-UML’s.Committee members told the Post that several complaints were filed against the four proposed envoys, raising serious issues, so they were unable to take a concrete decision.After completing the hearing of all proposed ambassadors, a meeting was slated for Sunday to take the final decision but due to the differences among the members, the meeting was deferred. Since the Rastriya Swatantra Party held its national jamboree on Tuesday and Wednesday, the meeting is rescheduled for Thursday, Ghimire said.Even Congress and UML members on the committee seem divided this time, a lawmaker said, after Congress panelists raised questions about the credentials of Timilsina. Then UML members also raised complaints against Sharma, Shrestha and Pandit.“We do not know what Congress and UML committee members and senior party leaders are thinking and discussing but due to the nature of complaints, there are serious disputes about the four proposed ambassadors and there is growing opinion that they should be rejected,” said a member on condition of anonymity.The complainer has stated that the recommendation of Sharma, who may be repeated as Nepal’s ambassador to India, goes against the ambassadorial appointment directives (2077 BS).As per the directives, the same person cannot be reappointed to head the same diplomatic mission, the complainant says.Committee members had asked that question to Sharma as well but he replied that this should be taken up with the government, not him.The government issued the directive but it has been violated by successive governments multiple times. Therefore, ambassadorial appointments never follow the spirit of the directive.The complaint against Shrestha, who is proposed for South Africa, raises the constitutional and legal question because as per the constitutional provision, a person cannot be repeated and reappointed to another constitutional post.Similarly, a case has been filed at the Supreme Court on behalf of Timilsina wherein he seeks to get continuity as acting chair of Nepal Red Cross Society, said the complainant. So he is unfit to serve as ambassador because he has filed a petition at the Supreme Court to get continuation as the chair of Nepal Red Cross Society and the court has not cleared the deck.Defending his case, Timilsina said that as an institution, the Red Cross had filed the case, not him. Timilsina was also accused of misusing the letter pad and stamp of the Red Cross Society and forming a parallel committee even after completing his tenure. The complainer has accused that Timilsina has misused the Red Cross’s name for personal gain, misused the letter pad and stamp and made illegal correspondence to various entities. A complaint was registered at the Kathmandu District Administration Office and Nepal Police is looking into the allegations.Committee members of the Congress and the UML were divided over the complaint against Timilsina, another member said. Now the UML has threatened to disqualify all three candidates recommended by the Congress if they continue to raise questions against Timilsina.“There are some complaints filed against the proposed ambassadors which we are looking into,” said Prakash Adhikari, a lawmaker from the Janata Samajbadi Party. “We have not decided what to do.”The proposed ambassador to Israel, Pandit faces a charge that he was penalised by the Information Commission and is thus unfit to serve as ambassador.When Pandit was the chief of Padma Kanya Campus in Kathmandu, the Information Commission fined him Rs15,000 for not sharing information. Later, he moved the Appellate Court against the commission's decision but the court gave its verdict in the commission’s favour.Pandit’s statement that he will try his best to stop the ongoing war between Israel and Hamas was also criticised. But Pandit defended his case during the hearing process stating that the fine was imposed on the campus chief of Padmakanya Campus, not him as a person.The government had recommended Naresh Bikram Dhakal (Saudi Arabia), Prof Dr Kapilman Shrestha (South Africa), Prof Dhana Prasad Pandit (Israel), Ram Krishna Bhattarai (Sri Lanka), Sanil Nepal (Spain), and Dr Shail Rupakheti (Germany) as ambassadors.The recommendation of Kanta Rijal for the Australia mission was later changed with the government choosing Chitra Lekha Yadav instead. Incumbent Foreign Secretary Sewa Lamasal has been recommended for the European Union and Brussels but both nominations have yet to be sent to the parliamentary hearing special committee.Lok Darshan Regmi (USA), Chandra Kumar Ghimire (UK), Shiva Maya Tumbahangphe (South Korea), Junga Bahadur Chauhan (Russia), Ramesh Chandra Poudel (Qatar), Prof Dr Krishna Prasad Oli (China), Dr Sumnima Tuladhar (Denmark), Dr Netra Prasad Timilsina (Malaysia), Prakash Mani Pokhrel (Portugal) and Rita Dhital (Pakistan) are others recommended for ambassador positions.“We will discuss the matter with legal experts and will proceed accordingly,” said Ghimire. “If someone wants to disqualify any ambassador, one needs a strong reason. But the complaints were not serious.” Taking an exception to the nomination, the hearing committee on September 9 summoned Foreign Minister Arzu Rana and inquired why the government had failed to make the appointments inclusive.On July 29, the government recommended 17 ambassadors and recalled some. The recommendations also failed to honour the spirit of inclusiveness. \nThe government has imposed a ban on carrying even licensed weapons in government offices and public spaces.The Ministry of Home Affairs issued an order putting a ban on carrying registered weapons in parliamentary buildings, courts, government offices, hospitals, educational institutions, public transport, marketplaces, shopping malls, cinemas, and other public and government locations.Publishing the notice in the National Gazette, the ministry said that the carrying of weapons by an individual is strictly prohibited except for renewal of permits.The government decision follows the arrest of medical entrepreneur Durga Prasai’s bodyguard in March 2024 at the Supreme Court premises, where he was found with an automatic weapon and ammunition. In response, the government launched a nationwide investigation into licensed firearms. Consequently, on September 16, the ministry published a notice in the gazette, introducing regulations on the use of licensed weapons and banning their use outside the home.“Invoking the authority granted by Section 8 of the Arms and Ammunition Act 1962, and in accordance with Section 3 of the same Act, individuals licensed to own or carry firearms are prohibited from taking such weapons outside their homes unless they hold a travel permit under Sections 4 and 5,” the gazette said. “Even licensed weapons cannot be carried into judicial bodies, parliamentary buildings and premises, or government offices, except for the purpose of renewing permits.”Similarly, firearms are banned in hospitals, airports, public transport, religious and educational institutions, cinemas, commercial buildings, marketplaces, shopping malls, gatherings or protests, archaeological and protected sites, children’s homes, and other locations prohibited by prevailing laws.Section 8 of the Arms and Ammunition Act 1962 specifies that the “government may prohibit the possession of firearms or ammunition in designated areas through a notice published in the Nepal Gazette.” This section grants the government the authority to forbid any individual from keeping or carrying specified firearms or ammunition in areas it deems necessary. \nThe Specialty Soy and Grains Alliance (SSGA), a business alliance of identity preserved agriculture in the United States, hosted the US Identity Preserved International Workshop at the Marriott Hotel, Naxal on Thursday.Identity preservation is a meticulous process of maintenance of unique qualities of a food product. The event brought together Nepal’s leading soy manufacturers, industry leaders, and farmers to explain the value and benefits of US-identified preserved grains and oilseeds. One of the event's highlights was Shree Radhe Rani International Trading receiving the first Identity Preservation Certificate in the world. This certification allows Nepali soy sauce manufacturers using American soy to display the ‘Identity Preserved United States’ logo on their products, which will help them boost their credibility and market value in the global market. “Our company is the first to receive the Identity Preserved certificate in the world. From today, Nepali soy sauce manufacturers using American soy can display the IP logo on all their products. This achievement was made possible with the help and support of the Specialty Soy and Grains Alliance (SSGA) and the US Soybean Export Council (USSEC),” said Gaurav Agrawal, Director of Shree Radhe Rani International Trading. The event also showcased local foods from US identity-preserved soy, including nuts, flours, tofu, and desserts.The workshop had several key speakers, including Tom Frisch, a US-based farmer who presented on growing US IP soy and other crops. Nishith Kumar, a soy food technical consultant, presented a soy food manufacturing demonstration and sampling that featured tofu, traditional sweets, toasted soy nuts, etc. Similarly, the food and beverage Director of Marriott Hotel, Joghindar Singh and Suresh Itapu, CEO of NuriTech Consulting Services Pvt Ltd, delivered presentations on the potential for premium soy in Nepal’s food and beverage sector and value-added products derived from all US IP soybeans.    \nThe Parliamentary Hearing Committee endorsed the appointment of 16 of the 17 ambassadorial nominees on Thursday.However, the committee endorsed names of four nominees through a majority of the committee as some of the members of the hearing committee expressed their differing views on the decision to endorse them. Twelve nominees were endorsed unanimously.The committee postponed the endorsement of Ramkrishna Bhattarai, the proposed ambassador to Sri Lanka, citing unavailability of his bachelor’s degree certificate.Lawmakers from the Janata Samajbadi Party Nepal (JSP-Nepal) and the Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP) registered their differing views regarding the endorsement of Kapil Shrestha, Netra Prasad Timilsina, Dhan Prasad Pandit, and Shankar Sharma, proposed ambassadors to South Africa, Malaysia, Israel, and India, respectively.The government nominated 17 individuals for various diplomatic postings. The nominations drew widespread criticism for allegedly neglecting inclusivity and ignoring established criteria for such positions. Kanta Rijal, who had been proposed as ambassador to Australia, was recalled due to performance concerns during her previous tenure in Israel. Later, the government recommended former lawmaker Chitra Lekha Yadav in her place.The ambassadorial nominees made by the government are appointed by the President for the diplomatic missions after they are endorsed by the parliamentary hearing committee. \nNepal is marking the ninth Constitution Day on Thursday. While the government is preparing to celebrate with special functions, a few Madhesh-based parties want to mark it as a Black Day. The Loktantrik Samajbadi Party is one of the disgruntled groups that has announced a protest on the occasion. But the Janamat Party, a new force that is leading the provincial government in Madhesh, has decided to celebrate the day. A document of compromise, multiple forces, including the Madhesh-based parties, have grievances over the present constitution. The CPN (Maoist Centre) registered its dissenting views on various issues at the time of drafting the constitution, including on the form of government. They stood for a directly elected presidential system and agreed to a compromise deal with other parties. The Rastriya Prajatantra Party, which lobbies for a Hindu kingdom, was against the secular republican system. The pro-monarchy party has frequently launched agitations demanding the same. A fringe Rastriya Janamorcha party has stood against federalism right from the start. Various other parties and groups oppose one or the other constitutional provision. But they haven’t taken an extreme decision to mark the day of its promulgation as a black day.It’s universally accepted that no constitution is perfect and a statute cannot satisfy all sections of the society. It is hence said that a constitution is a living document that can be amended and updated based on people’s aspirations and the changed reality. Nepal’s constitution and political forces of the country have accepted these facts. The major political forces at the time of unveiling the constitution in 2015 promised the disgruntled groups that they would address some of their ‘genuine concerns’ through amendments. They have a moral responsibility to keep their word. After its promulgation, the statute has been amended multiple times. Going against the usual parliamentary practice of one of the two largest parties forming the government and the other leading the opposition bloc in the House, Nepal’s two largest forces—the Nepali Congress and the CPN-UML—are now together in government. The given rationale for their coming together is to amend the constitution and ensure political stability. Again, it is incumbent upon them to do so based on broadest possible consultations. Registering differences, pressing the establishment to get their demands addressed and peacefully fighting for the cause they believe is a democratic right of each and every Nepali. But the manner of the protest matters. The parties and the leaders that have joined governments and governed the country multiple times, both before and after the promulgation of the constitution, should present themselves in a more mature way. It smacks of hypocrisy when they say and do one thing when in the government and the complete opposite when out of power. More importantly, people should be convinced the agendas and demands of political forces are genuine. It is unfortunate that over the past decade, people have come to believe that the Madhesh-based parties are more than willing to trade their agenda for Cabinet seats. Their image has taken a nosedive, as is reflected in recent election results. The role of strong regional forces is important in the federal system we have adopted. However, the country’s regional parties are getting weaker due to divisions. A few months after a group led by Ashok Rai split the Upendra Yadav-led Janata Samajbadi Party-Nepal, a former Loktantrik Samajbadi Party leader Rajendra Mahato announced another new outfit on Tuesday. Madheshis are not impressed. They have some valid demands but they need credible political outfits to champion them.  \nThere is no doubt that the promulgation of the Constitution of Nepal, 2015, nine years ago, was a significant accomplishment. That was primarily because it represented the realisation of the decades-old national dream of being governed by a constitution drafted by a sovereign body elected by the people of Nepal. Due to its “fast-tracked” provenance, the kind of deliberations that would have granted it much greater legitimacy was sorely missing. Even so, it was a milestone in Nepal’s history.That momentous achievement was, however, marred by the somewhat contradictory turn of events in that it was adopted in the face of opposition by a large section of the populace, particularly from the Tarai. While the royalist Rastriya Prajatantra Party had expectedly voted against the republican and secular constitution, all the Madhesh-based parties had boycotted the proceedings altogether. The main grouse of the latter was the delineation of provincial boundaries, but there were also strong misgivings over the distribution of parliamentary constituencies as well as restrictions on the right of women to pass citizenship to their offspring.The whys and the whereforesWith the political space heating up amidst talk of amending the constitution following the Nepali Congress-UML pact, we appear to be headed for another round of acrimony. As per the two-party agreement, the express purpose of the amendment would be to identify the constitution’s “strengths and weaknesses and complexities that have emerged in practice” which have contributed to Nepal’s chronic political instability. Party leaders have been clear that their main target is the current mixed electoral system, particularly proportional representation (PR), which they are more than quite certain is the primary cause for the never-ending making and breaking of governments. It is a different matter that our own experience from the 1990s clearly indicates otherwise, and other countries that have adopted PR have not been similarly blighted by the kind of instability that has become the hallmark of Nepali politics.Beyond that, given the two parties’ record, there was immediate suspicion that they would try to do away with some of the more progressive elements of the constitution. The Nepali Congress leader, Sher Bahadur Deuba, has in the past hinted secularism could be up for negotiation. And while Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli has maintained that any amendment would lead to an even more liberal document, given his earlier stance on issues such as inclusion and devolution of provincial authority, there are reasons aplenty to consider his assertion with a block of salt.Besides the political parties, there have been similar calls from the judicial sector as well. Two prominent recently retired Supreme Court justices who had both served on the court’s constitutional bench have spelt out the need for amendments. Anand Mohan Bhattarai believes that it should begin with the political leadership first identifying where the bottlenecks are. The second jurist, Ishwor Khatiwada, goes further and argues that each and every article of the constitution should be up for review, albeit for the purpose of improving them and not to fulfil the interests of any political party. The latter, obviously, is the crux of the problem. Without doubt, there will be some fiddling with the constitution; it is only a question of when, not if.Self-inquiry before self-interest Now that he is out of office, the Maoist supremo, Pushpa Kamal Dahal Prachanda, has suddenly felt the need to re-embrace the agenda that propelled him to power but which he had lost sight of in his extended romp in the nation’s highest offices. Thus, he says that his party would be amenable to constitutional amendments provided there are no “attempts to shrink the rights of the citizens and dismiss the achievements in the name of the constitution amendment”.Perhaps, it was the still-muted pushback that prompted Deuba to clarify that the provinces would remain, and instead, the focus would be on strengthening the provincial structure. He also said that many groups in the country will have to be provided with proportional representation in governance structure. “This country belongs to everyone,” he said somewhat sagely.The hard sell, of course, will be to the Madhesh-based parties. For instance, the president of the Tarai Madhesh Loktantrik Party, Brikhesh Chandra Lal, writes that the move by the ruling coalition could be a cover for “extreme nationalism” which would ultimately negate sub-national identities. He believes such a move “could increase the possibility of the country getting stuck in a permanent conflict”. Conflict does not necessarily mean violence, but the kind of upheaval Lal warns about will have the same deleterious effect overall. Hence, the need to tread carefully and take all sides into confidence instead of ramming through amendments on the basis of parliamentary strength.I do not think the NC-UML combine would opt for a path of confrontation. Going back to Deuba, we can take heart in his words that there was no need to distrust them since both parties have emerged out of the struggle for democracy. “Personally, I first met him [Oli] in jail. We have both fought for democracy. As parties that fought for democracy throughout our student life and jail experiences, there is no way we can go against democracy.”One can read something in his use of the now-discredited “prajatantra” to refer to democracy instead of the more-favoured “loktrantra”. But it could easily just have been a momentary lapse, attributable to his advanced age.Age did not hamper someone else in lucid expression though. In the summer of 1787, at the end of the rather raucous convention that drafted the American constitution, 81-year-old Benjamin Franklin, by then the elder statesman in the room, made a statement that rings true for all time: “I confess that there are several parts of this constitution which I do not at present approve, but I am not sure I shall never approve them: For having lived long, I have experienced many instances of being obliged by better information, or fuller consideration, to change opinions even on important subjects, which I once thought right, but found to be otherwise. It is therefore that the older I grow, the more apt I am to doubt my own judgment, and to pay more respect to the judgment of others.”Those wise words should guide our politicians even as they begin discussions on changes to the constitution. We can only hope that they are capable of the same humility borne out of a lifetime of self-enquiry that Franklin articulated so eloquently. \nAs a child growing up in the early 1990s, I remember learning in school about the greenhouse effect. Carbon dioxide released by burning fossil fuels traps heat near the Earth’s surface, like the glass of a greenhouse. I imagined myself on the playground, roasting inside a humid hothouse.Fast forward 30 years, and the terms have changed.For a while, “global warming” was the go-to expression for talking about rising global temperatures and the role of human activities, particularly the use of fossil fuels. It had a spike in internet searches in 2007, probably due to former Vice President Al Gore’s documentary “An Inconvenient Truth: A Global Warning,” which hit theatres in 2006.Near the end of the Obama administration, “climate change” became the most common term. It’s now trending in Google searches more than global warming. Both terms make the same point: Rising global temperatures have major consequences on local weather patterns and worldwide climate effects, including stronger hurricanes, droughts, floods and fires.Trending termsGoogle Trends tracks the relative popularity of internet search terms over time. The popularity of the term \"global warming\" has declined globally in recent years, while \"climate change\" has risen.However, the words we use to discuss these effects can make a large difference in how people understand the risks and the need for more sustainable choices.What’s in a name?I’m a linguistics researcher currently living on Mayotte Island, off the coast of Madagascar, where I study climate change knowledge among local populations and the language they use to discuss it.Local fishers in Mayotte struggle to talk about the phenomenon because there is no established terminology for it. What my colleagues and I have learned offers some insight into the difficulties people in many cultures have with understanding climate change.In the grand scheme of climate change education and sustainability efforts, this seemingly minor problem of translation is in fact symptomatic of a larger underlying issue regarding the relationship between humans and their environment.In fact, when we dig deeper into the challenges of communicating climate change across cultures, two factors come into play: spiritual beliefs and notions of time.Spiritual language can overlapSpiritual and religious beliefs can play an important role in how climate change is understood and even named. For example, the translation for the term climate in Inuktitut, an Inuit language spoken in Canada, is “sila.” However, sila also refers to wisdom, the spirit, the earth, and the universe. It is something sacred to be revered.Seen through the lens of this second set of definitions, sila is effectively impossible for people to influence. It is beyond humankind’s reach to change the cosmos. As a result, communication aimed at promoting awareness of climate change becomes politicised in Eastern Canadian Inuit languages.My colleagues and I encountered similar challenges while discussing possible future efforts to slow down environmental destruction caused by climate change in Mayotte.The Maore fishers we interviewed, many of whom were of deep Islamic faith, often responded with “Inshallah,” or God willing, when questioned about efforts the community could make in the future to address the problem. They saw these climate change-related events as out of their hands, as something only God could interfere with.Different understanding of timeSecond, we might think that time is objective and therefore shared across cultures. But as Albert Einstein argued, time is relative.Time is not only relative scientifically speaking but also culturally. For example, the ancient Greeks had more than three types of time, one of which we still use today, Kronos, or linear time—think chronological order. We have all but forgotten Aion, or sacred, eternal time, and Kairos, or cyclical time.Notions of time play an important role when thinking about climate change since the heart of the phenomenon involves a slow, continuous change over a long period. We cannot see climate change happen with the naked eye, because it occurs over years and decades. Of course, we can see its effects on weather patterns, including extreme heat waves and heavy downpours.Getting people to think about time in a way that simultaneously thinks about the now, and a “then” in the distant future proves to be challenging in many cultures.For example, researchers studying sustainability efforts in the Maldives Islands have come up against this very issue. While discussing time, many local residents think in terms of the now and the near future, whereas policymakers must think about longer-term effects on a larger scale. These contrasting approaches to time have made it difficult to put into place sustainability efforts to tackle rising sea levels—a significant threat to this tropical nation of 26 atolls.Translating climate changeA first step to confronting this problem is to put language at the forefront of climate change education efforts.One youth-driven nonprofit making strides in this area is Climate Cardinals. The group’s objective is to translate climate change research into as many languages as possible. Most scientific studies and reports are in English, which can be a barrier to the many non-English speakers around the globe. In their efforts to translate this research and related phenomena, they need to think carefully about how important words are translated and understood.The United Nations and other groups are also starting to take seriously the connection between climate change scepticism and religion, including the need to reconcile eventual points of friction.For example, the Faith for Earth Initiative works with religious organisations to address the compatibility of sustainability efforts and faith. It does this by helping religious leaders connect core spiritual values, like caring and rejection of greed, to the community’s environment, thus reconnecting with nature and seeing themselves as its stewards.Finally, it is imperative to keep studying local or indigenous knowledge about the environment as related to change and time. The ancient Greeks certainly had their reasons for dividing time into multiple categories. So what were the environmental and historical influences that led them to do so?For instance, researchers and community members in Australia are looking to reconcile Indigenous knowledge with Western science. Thanks to the locals’ long-standing observations of their environment over several generations, they were able to identify local effects of climate change. Such information is often overlooked and difficult to obtain by traditional research methods.Beyond the headlinesClimate change awareness and sustainability efforts will only increase over time. Care needs to be taken to how these concepts are lived, understood and talked about in non-Western settings. Language is part and parcel of these efforts and deserves to be considered more carefully.-The Conversation Read the original article here. \nAccess to quality education in Nepal's rural areas is hindered by a severe shortage of qualified teachers, particularly in science and math, leading to a lack of students and compromised education outcomes.\nIsrael bombed southern Lebanon on Thursday and said it had thwarted an Iranian-led assassination plot, a day after explosions of Hezbollah radios that came on the heels of blasts in booby trapped pagers, setting the foes hurtling towards war.The sophisticated attacks on armed group Hezbollah's communications equipment, which killed 37 people and wounded around 3,000 over two days, sowed disarray in Lebanon, with panicked residents abandoning their mobile phones.\"This isn’t a small matter, it’s war. Who can even secure their phone now? When I heard about what happened yesterday, I left my phone on my motorcycle and walked away,\" said Mustafa Sibal on a street near central Beirut.A distant roar in the skies could be heard in Beirut from what Lebanese state media said was Israeli jets breaking the sound barrier - a sound that has grown increasingly common in recent months.Israel said its warplanes struck villages in southern Lebanon overnight, and a security source and Hezbollah's al-Manar TV reported airstrikes near the border resumed on Thursday just after midday.Hand-held radios used by Hezbollah detonated on Wednesday across Lebanon's south. The Lebanese health minister raised the death toll, saying 25 people had been killed and 608 injured in the country's deadliest day since cross-border fighting erupted between the militants and Israel in parallel with the Gaza war last year.The previous day, hundreds of pagers - used by Hezbollah to evade mobile phone surveillance - exploded at once, killing 12 people including two children, and injuring more than 2,300.In a post on X, Lebanese Prime Minister Najib Mikati called on the United Nations Security Council to take a firm stand to stop Israel's \"aggression\" and \"technological war\" against his country.Israel has not commented directly on the booby-trapped walkie-talkies and pagers, but multiple security sources have said the attacks were carried out by its spy agency Mossad.Israel says its conflict with Hezbollah, like its war in Gaza against Palestinian militant group Hamas, is part of a wider regional confrontation with Iran, which sponsors both groups as well as armed movements in Syria, Yemen and Iraq.On Thursday Israeli security forces announced that an Israeli businessman had been arrested last month after attending at least two meetings in Iran, where he discussed assassinating Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, the defence minister or the head of the Shin Bet spy agency.Last week, Shin Bet uncovered what it said was a plot by Hezbollah to assassinate former Defence Minister Moshe Ya'alon.Israel has been accused of assassinations including a blast in Tehran that killed the leader of Hamas and another in a Beirut suburb that killed a senior Hezbollah commander within hours of each other in July.Despite the events of the past few days, a spokesperson for the U.N. peacekeeping mission in southern Lebanon said the situation along the frontier had \"not changed much in terms of exchanges of fire between the parties\".\"There was an intensification last week. This week it is more or less the same. There are still exchanges of fire. It is still worrying, still concerning, and the rhetoric is high,\" the spokesperson, Andrea Tenenti, told Reuters.Israel and Hezbollah have been exchanging fire across the Israeli-Lebanon border in parallel with the war Israel has waged in Gaza against Hamas, the Palestinian militant group whose fighters attacked Israel on Oct. 7.Tens of thousands of people have had to flee the Israel-Lebanon border area on both sides. Netanyahu vowed on Wednesday to return the evacuated Israelis \"securely to their homes\".SHIFTING FOCUSThe Israeli military said its overnight air strikes hit Hezbollah targets in Chihine, Tayibe, Blida, Meiss El Jabal, Aitaroun and Kfarkela in southern Lebanon, as well as a Hezbollah weapons storage facility in the area of Khiam.Israeli media reported that a number of Israeli civilians had been wounded by anti-tank missile fire from Lebanon, but there was no official confirmation.On Wednesday, Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant said the war was moving into a new phase, with more resources and military units now being shifted to the northern border.According to Israeli officials, the forces being deployed there include the 98th Division, an elite formation including commando and paratroop elements that has been fighting in Gaza.Hezbollah launched missile barrages on Israel on the day after the Oct. 7 attack by Hamas, and since then there has been a constant exchange of fire that neither side has allowed to escalate into a full-scale war.However, tens of thousands have been evacuated on both sides of the border, and there has been mounting pressure in Israel for the government to get the evacuees back home. \nNorwegian human rights foundation awards jailed Cuban dissident leader Luis Manuel Otero Alcantara the Rafto Prize for his anti-authoritarian art, calling for his release from a 5-year sentence.\nA child enrolled in a Japanese school in the Chinese city of Shenzhen has died after being stabbed on Wednesday, officials confirmed on Thursday, the second such attack near Japanese educational centres in China in recent months.Chinese authorities said the 10-year-old boy was a Japanese national born to a Japanese father and a Chinese mother, and he had been stabbed on his way to school at about 8 AM on Wednesday by a 44-year-old assailant surnamed Zhong.He died in the early hours of Thursday, Japanese foreign minister Yoko Kamikawa told reporters in Tokyo.“Medical experts made every effort to save his life, and the Chinese side will provide the necessary assistance to his family to take care of his affairs,” Lin Jian, a Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson, told a regular news conference in Beijing.“According to the information currently available, this is an individual case and such incidents could occur in any country,” he added.On Thursday afternoon, people laid wreaths at the gates of the school in Shenzhen’s affluent Shekou area, which is home to most of the city’s foreign community and international schools.“As Chinese people, we oppose this behaviour, we oppose teachings of hatred,” said one man who identified himself as an ordinary Shenzhen resident.“Many of us have been under such teachings of hate for a long time, leading to such evil consequences,” he added. The attack took place on the anniversary of an incident in 1931 that triggered war between China and Japan, a sensitive date at a time when diplomatic relations are in danger of deteriorating.“I actually did not know 18th September was this day for Chinese people to take revenge for things in the Second World War,” said a Japanese father of two children in Shenzhen, who asked to only be identified by his surname, Suzuki, out of safety concerns.“I have lived here for seven years and did not know we need to be cautious for being Japanese while living in China.”Japan has asked China to provide a detailed explanation of the facts and to take strong safety measures, Kamikawa told reporters earlier in the day.“I take the incident extremely seriously,” she added.“This should never happen in any country. Particularly, I sincerely regret that this despicable act was committed against a child on their way to school.”The local Japanese chamber of commerce has asked the Japanese government to ensure the safety of its nationals in the area, the organisation said in a statement.It was the second such attack near a Japanese educational facility in China in recent months. In June, a man attacked a bus used by a Japanese school in the eastern city of Suzhou, resulting in the death of a Chinese national who tried to shield a Japanese mother and her child from the assailant. \nPeace talks between Colombia's government and the ELN rebel group have been halted after an attack killed two soldiers, prompting the government to call for a demonstration of peace from the ELN to resume negotiations.\nDifferent countries have congratulated Nepal on Construction Day.In a message to President Ramchandra Paudel, British King Charles conveyed heartfelt congratulations to the President and the Nepali on the occasion.“I value the bond between our nations and hope that our countries can continue to work closely together on important global issues, whether they be peace and prosperity or environment and climate change, which will benefit future generations for years to come,” said Charles.“My wife and I would like to take this opportunity to send you and all Nepalis our warmest good wishes for the coming year.”In an official statement, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken extended greetings to Nepalis on behalf of the US government.“The United States greatly values our 77 years of friendship with Nepal. We are proud of our joint efforts to strengthen people-to-people ties, boost economic growth through initiatives like the debt-free partnership with the Millennium Challenge Corporation, promote justice, and uphold democratic principles,” said Blinken.“We remain committed to working with Nepal to increase its climate resilience and advance its transition to clean energy. We look forward to our continued close collaboration in the future.”Blinken said it is also an important moment to recognise many of Nepal’s achievements, including the recent passage of historic transitional justice legislation, and we look forward to its successful implementation bringing justice for victims and survivors.Likewise, the European Union has extended best wishes to the government and people of Nepal on Constitution Day.“The European Union in Nepal remains committed to supporting Nepal’s journey towards a more democratic, inclusive, and prosperous future. Together, we can achieve great things,” the Delegation of the European Union to Nepal said in a post on X.Similarly, Australian ambassador to Nepal Leann Johnston, in a post on X, said Australia sends its warmest wishes to the government and people of Nepal on Constitution Day. \nMinister for Foreign Affairs Arzu Rana and her Canadian counterpart Mélanie Joly held bilateral talks in Ottawa on Wednesday.According to Minister Rana's secretariat, the discussion focused on strengthening Nepal-Canada relations, mutual interests, economic investments, and partnerships.Minister Rana is in Canada to attend the Women Foreign Ministers' Meeting.During their meeting, the two ministers discussed the diplomatic relations established in 1965 and expressed satisfaction with the strong ties between the two nations. Rana appreciated Canada’s support for Nepal’s democratic process and constitution-building efforts. She informed the Canadian minister that Nepal’s Parliament recently passed an amendment bill to the transitional justice law, marking a significant step towards completing the peace process.The foreign minister also thanked Canada for its support during challenging times, such as the 2015 earthquake and the Covid-19 pandemic. Her secretariat said she acknowledged Canada's long-standing economic assistance and its role as a development partner for Nepal.Likewise, Minister Rana urged Canada to establish an embassy in Nepal, citing the growing number of Nepali students studying in Canada and the increasing number of Canadian tourists visiting Nepal. She highlighted the need for further cooperation in various sectors, including research, business, and hydropower, where Canada has extensive experience.“The two foreign ministers also underlined the importance of cooperation in international forums in the agendas of shared interest, such as promoting multilateralism, addressing climate change and implementing the sustainable development goals,” stated a press release issued by the Embassy of Nepal in Ottawa after the meeting between the two ministers.Minister Rana also emphasised Nepal’s contributions to UN peacekeeping missions, noting that 2,554 Nepali women have served, with 608 currently deployed.The two ministers agreed to hold further bilateral talks in Kathmandu this December.According to Minister Rana’s secretariat, Canada has agreed to continue supporting women’s empowerment in Nepal and collaborate on its ‘Feminist Foreign Policy’. Canadian Foreign Minister Joly encouraged Nepal to work together on this initiative and praised Nepal’s recent progress in inclusivity and women’s rights.Joly also expressed Canada’s readiness to support Nepal through the Canadian Pension Fund and responded positively to Foreign Minister Rana’s proposal to establish a Canadian embassy in Nepal.Minister Joly highlighted the increasing presence of Nepalis in Canada, praising them for their honesty and dedication to work. She reaffirmed Canada’s commitment to assisting Nepal in women’s empowerment, pledging support for establishing a women’s university and promoting girls’ education.Additionally, Joly welcomed Minister Rana’s proposal for cooperation in e-governance, expressing willingness to move forward with mutual collaboration. On the occasion, Minister Rana invited Minister Joly to visit Nepal. Earlier, Foreign Minister Rana met with the chair and members of the Canada-Nepal Parliamentary Friendship Group. According to a statement from Nepal’s foreign ministry, Sonia Sidhu, chair of the parliamentary group and a Member of Parliament, expressed her pleasure at hosting the first official visit by a Nepali foreign minister to Canada.Both sides reviewed the strong ties between the parliaments of Nepal and Canada, underscoring the importance of promoting regular exchanges and sharing experiences between the parliamentarians of both nations. They also expressed satisfaction with the growing people-to-people relations and acknowledged the valuable contributions of the Nepali diaspora in strengthening this bond. \nTwo people died in a motorcycle accident in ward 6 of Lamahi Municipality along the Lamahi-Ghorahi road section early Thursday morning.The motorcycle, heading from Lamahi to Ghorahi, overturned, causing fatalities, according to police.The deceased are 22-year-old Shrawan Kumar Pun of Ghorahi Sub-Metropolitan City-18, who was the motorcyclist, and 21-year-old Vinod KC of Ghorahi-4, who was the pillion rider.Both victims were transported to Lamahi Hospital, where they were pronounced dead by the attending doctors.Deputy Superintendent of Police Ram Prasad Timilsina, spokesperson for the District Police Office, Dang, said an investigation into the accident is underway. \nNorth Korea tested new tactical ballistic missiles using super-large warheads and modified cruise missiles on Wednesday as leader Kim Jong Un called for stronger conventional weapons and nuclear capabilities, state news agency KCNA reported.The tests to improve weapons capabilities are required because of the grave threat posed by outside forces to the security of the country, Kim, who led the tests, was quoted as saying.The account followed the firing of multiple short-range ballistic missiles on Wednesday reported by the South Korean military, which was the second time the North test-launched missiles in a week.Last week, North Korea also unveiled a uranium enrichment facility, in its first such public report.Kim stressed “the need to continue to bolster up the nuclear force and have the strongest military technical capability and overwhelming offensive capability in the field of conventional weapons too,” KCNA said.Wednesday’s tests involved the new tactical ballistic Hwasongpho-11-Da-4.5 missiles, KCNA said, indicating it was part of a series of short-range ballistic missiles it had been developing.The missile was mounted with a 4.5-ton super-large conventional warhead, KCNA said.North Korea’s state media reported the tests of missiles with the same name in July, which was considered a partial success. On Thursday, state media released photographs of a projectile striking a target in a hilly area.South Korea’s military said on Thursday two ballistic missiles landed in a mountainous area in the North’s northeast.Such a missile launch test with an intention to hit an inland target is likely unprecedented, said Shin Seung-ki who is the head of research on North Korea’s military at the state-run Korea Institute for Defense Analyses in Seoul.North Korea routinely test-launches missiles to drop in the sea or on an uninhabited island.The particular missile with the Hwasongpho-11-Da-4.5 designation is still under development but Russia may want it soon if its performance and reliability can be guaranteed through further testing, Shin said.“North Korea will want to shorten that time as much as possible,” he said.Kyiv officials and independent experts have said there were signs some of the missiles used by Russia in the war against Ukraine were North Korean-made, including some that were produced this year. Moscow and Pyongyang both deny any illicit arms trade or shipments.The North’s military also tested a strategic cruise missile that has been upgraded for combat use, KCNA said.North Korea has criticized military drills by the South Korean and U.S. militaries, including a large-scale exercise conducted this summer, as preparations for war on the Korean peninsula.The allies say the drills are defensive in nature and aimed at maintaining readiness against any North Korean aggression. \nHand-held radios used by armed group Hezbollah detonated on Wednesday across Lebanon’s south in the country’s deadliest day since cross-border fighting erupted between the militants and Israel nearly a year ago, stoking tensions after similar explosions of the group’s pagers the day before.Lebanon’s health ministry said 20 people were killed and more than 450 injured on Wednesday in Beirut’s suburbs and the Bekaa Valley, while the death toll from Tuesday’s explosions rose to 12, including two children, with nearly 3,000 injured.Israeli officials have not commented on the blasts, but security sources said Israel’s spy agency Mossad was responsible. One Hezbollah official said the episode was the biggest security breach in the group’s history.The operations, which appeared to throw Hezbollah into disarray, played out alongside Israel’s 11-month-old war in Gaza and heightened fears of an escalation on its Lebanese border and the risk of a full-blown regional war.“We are opening a new phase in the war. It requires courage, determination and perseverance from us,” Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant said in remarks at an air force base.Jordan’s Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi accused Israel of pushing the Middle East to the brink of a regional war by orchestrating a dangerous escalation on many fronts.The US, which denied any involvement in the blasts, said it was pursuing intensive diplomacy to avert an escalation of the conflict. A US official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Israel told Washington on Tuesday it was going to do something in Lebanon. But Israel did not provide details and the operation itself was a surprise to Washington, the official said.At least one of Wednesday’s blasts in Lebanon took place near a funeral organised by Iran-backed Hezbollah for those killed the previous day when thousands of the group’s pagers exploded across the country and wounded many of its fighters.A Reuters reporter in the southern suburbs of Beirut said he saw Hezbollah members frantically taking batteries out of any walkie-talkies that had not exploded, tossing the parts in metal barrels. Hezbollah turned to pagers and other low-tech communication devices in an attempt to evade Israeli surveillance of mobile phones.Lebanon’s Red Cross said on X that it responded with 30 ambulance teams to multiple explosions in different areas, including the south of Lebanon and the Bekaa Valley.Images of the exploded walkie-talkies showed labels with “ICOM” and “made in Japan.” According to its website, ICOM, which did not immediately reply to a request for comment, is a Japan-based radio communications and telephone company.The company has said that production of model IC-V82, which appeared to be the model in the images, was phased out in 2014.The hand-held radios were purchased by Hezbollah five months ago, around the same time as the pagers, a security source said.In Tuesday’s explosions, sources said Israeli spies remotely detonated explosives they planted in a Hezbollah order of 5,000 pagers before they entered the country.The United Nations Security Council will meet on Friday about the pager blasts after a request by Arab states.Tehran’s ambassador in Lebanon was superficially injured in Tuesday’s blasts, Iran’s semi-official Fars news agency reported then. But the New York Times on Wednesday said he lost one eye and the other was severely injured when a pager he was carrying exploded, citing two members of Iran’s Revolutionary Guard.Iran’s envoy to the U.N. said in a letter on Wednesday that it “reserves its rights under international law to take required measures deemed necessary to respond” to the attack.HEZBOLLAH LAUNCHES ROCKETSHezbollah, which has vowed to retaliate against Israel, said on Wednesday it attacked Israeli artillery positions with rockets, the first strike at its arch-foe since the blasts. The Israeli military said there were no reports of any damage or casualties.“Hezbollah wants to avoid an all-out war,” said Mohanad Hage Ali, deputy director of research at the Carnegie Middle East Center in Beirut. “But given the scale ... there will be pressure for a stronger response.”The two sides have been fighting across the Lebanese border since the Gaza conflict erupted on Oct. 7, 2023, fuelling fears of a wider Middle East war that could drag in the United States and Iran. The previous highest daily Lebanese death toll was 11 who died in Israeli shelling last month, according to official counts.Gallant said Israel, which has vowed to return evacuated residents to their homes in the north, was transferring troops and resources to the Lebanon border region. Israeli sources said this included the army’s 98th Division, which has commando and paratrooper formations, moving from Gaza to the north.“The ‘centre of gravity’ is moving north, meaning that we are allocating forces, resources and energy for the northern arena,” Gallant said in remarks released by his office.A full-blown war with Israel could devastate Lebanon, which has lurched from one crisis to another, including a 2019 financial collapse and the 2020 Beirut port blast.Rising tensions may also complicate so far unsuccessful efforts by mediators Egypt, Qatar and the U.S. to negotiate a Gaza ceasefire between Israel and militant group Hamas, a Hezbollah ally also backed by Iran.White House national security spokesperson John Kirby said on Wednesday it was too soon to assess the impact of the blasts on ceasefire talks.Hezbollah, Iran’s most powerful proxy in the Middle East, said in a statement it would continue to support Hamas in Gaza and Israel should await a response to the pager “massacre.”A Hamas delegation visited people wounded in the blasts in Lebanese hospitals on Wednesday, Lebanese state news agency NNA said.The explosions followed a series of assassinations of Hezbollah and Hamas commanders and leaders ascribed to Israel since the start of the Gaza war. \nGeopolitical conflicts and tensions are fuelling a surge of economic fragmentation and protectionism around the world, which would hit poor nations in particular, experts warn. In addition, there is a climate crisis, which would require huge amounts of money to cushion the shocks.But who will fund it?The Horizons Dialogue series, organised by the British Embassy and UK International Development in Kathmandu on Wednesday, brought together national and international experts to discuss the challenges and opportunities in Nepal’s development in the next ten years amid geopolitical conflicts and growing climate crisis. Experts have warned that the geopolitical conflict's repercussions could cause Nepal to lose foreign grants, loans, and other support.“We [Nepal] have seen a decline in international cooperation after the Covid-19 pandemic, the Russia-Ukraine war and conflict in the Middle-East countries,” said Kalpana Khanal, senior research fellow leading the Center for Economic and Infrastructure Development Policy at the Policy Research Institute. She was speaking on the theme ‘Navigating Nepal’s Fragility’.Khanal said, “The world is experiencing violence, interstate wars, and economic turbulence, with some countries adopting more anti-globalisation policies and populist regimes. This could cause a decline in international cooperation.”What will happen then? Khanal explained that such a scenario would force Nepal to focus on revenue collection to repay loans and interest rather than funding critical projects.“Currently, Nepal is channelling 22 percent of its total revenue towards debt servicing. In such a situation, if we do not receive the grant and rely more on loans, it will hinder overall development,” said Khanal.Nepal's public debt is 43 percent of its total GDP, half of which is made up of external loans and support.“We can potentially face a decline in international cooperation, as global lenders and development partners may channel funds towards the war-ridden countries like Ukraine and Palestine,” Khanal said.Khanal said climate change, amid geopolitical tension, may hamper projects built with foreign loans. “Many of the ongoing hydropower projects in Nepal rely on foreign loans. The devastating floods and landslides due to extreme weather conditions increase the project's costs. This, too, impacts public debt,” Khanal said.The global war will bring not only disaster but also hunger.Khanal said Nepal’s food inflation increased sharply after the Covid-19 pandemic and the Russia-Ukraine war. “It’s high time the country focused on food security.”According to a report prepared by the organisers, over the next decade, changes in the demand for Nepali workers, particularly in India and the Middle East, or geopolitical events that limit labour migration could have major impacts on the national development trajectory.Climate change, disasters, and health crises could also have significant economic impacts. In recent years, disruptions to agriculture from droughts and floods have led to sharp rises in food prices, the report said.Nearly 60 percent of Nepal’s population relies on agriculture, and two-thirds of that group is engaged in subsistence farming. The report said that, as a result of male outmigration, women constitute 73 percent of the agricultural workforce.Over the past decades, air quality has significantly deteriorated, consistently exceeding the World Health Organization's limits. The participants say that without significant intervention, it is likely to deteriorate further in the next five years.“But hopefully, in 10 years, we have projected some improvement in some areas,” said Arun Bhakta Shrestha, senior climate change specialist and programme manager for the Regional River Basins and Cryosphere programme of International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development (ICIMOD).Air pollution in the Kathmandu valley and the Tarai presents a growing health crisis, with around 12 percent of Kathmandu’s population suffering from chronic respiratory diseases like asthma and pneumonia, threatening to reverse reductions in infant and child mortality, the report said.Air pollution hazards will be worsened by more frequent hydrometeorological events such as droughts and heatwaves, with huge knock-on effects for the health of the population, the report said.Comparing the National Board of Diseases report of Nepal between 2011 and 2021, in 2011, malnutrition was the number one cause of death but now it's air pollution. Over 20 percent of deaths are now caused by air pollution in Nepal, which is around 42,000 deaths annually, said Dr Meghnath Dhimal, an environmental health scientist and chief research officer at Nepal Health Research Council.As South Asia is suffering from heat waves, which increase non-communicable diseases, many people are now using more chemicals than before because once the temperature goes high, the effectiveness of the insecticide goes down, Dhimal said. “As a result, more people are suffering from cancer, diabetes, malaises, and others,” he said.Climate change, air pollution, and bio-diseases may result in the epidemic of the non-communicable disease. As climate change and air pollution all cause non-communicable diseases, this share may go up to 90 percent in the next five to ten years, Dhimal said.Rob Fenn, the British ambassador to Nepal, said, “As the world grapples with climate change, Nepal is bearing the brunt despite contributing very little to global emissions.”It is vital that global action supports Nepal’s resilience and growth, Fenn said. “The UK will remain a reliable partner in helping Nepal recover from shocks, adapt to challenges, and thrive,” he said.“Our programmes will continue to invest in climate resilience, sustainable economic growth, and health systems that serve all communities.”  \n\nOn September 1, on the final day of the Nepali Congress Central Working Committee meeting, General Secretary Bishwa Prakash Sharma explicitly urged Sher Bahadur Deuba, the party president, to give up his aspirations to be the prime minister yet again.As per the seven-point agreement between the Congress and the CPN-UML on July 1, UML Chairman KP Sharma Oli, the incumbent prime minister, will lead the government for the first two years. Then Congress chief Deuba will lead the government until the elections in November-December 2027. Sharma urged Deuba to leave the prime minister’s post for another senior Congress leader. Deuba reportedly rejected the proposal outright.“I will not give up the position just because someone so desires,” Deuba reportedly said in response.Sharma, one of the two general secretaries of the country’s oldest political party, had proposed an exit policy in his contemporary political proposal tabled at the Mahasamiti meeting in February for the leaders holding state positions such as president, prime minister, ministers.Besides Sharma's proposal, the Mahasamiti also endorsed the papers submitted by Vice-president Purna Bahadur Khadka and General Secretary Gagan Thapa. However, it also gave room for the central committee to modify the proposal. When the central committee approved Khadka’s policy proposal and Thapa’s organisational proposal with minor changes, Sharma’s paper was pushed back to be considered while amending the national constitution.Sharma proposed one term for the [country’s] President, two terms for the prime minister, three terms for ministers, and four terms for lawmakers. Sharma’s proposal on term limits on persons serving as the country’s president or the prime minister is a national rather than the party’s issue, so it has been deferred, according to party leaders. Most of the Congress central leaders who spoke at the meeting, which lasted almost a month with gaps in between, claimed that fixing a time limit for the leadership was contrary to the democratic principle that the party champions.UML chief whip Mahesh Bartaula also says that since politics is a voluntary job, the politicians should be able to contribute to the society for as long as they want. “Nonetheless, the exit policy proposal is thought-provoking,” Bartaula told the Post. As a new generation of leaders is yet to be fully developed, the public still trusts the older crop of leaders, he argues. “Those vying for top positions are yet to gain the public’s credibility.”For Krishna Pokharel, a professor of political science, it would be unnatural to amend the constitution to address Sharma’s demand. “In countries where people directly elect their prime minister, amending the constitution to limit the executive head’s term could be reasonable” Pokharel told the Post. “However, in a country like Nepal where the parties choose the prime minister, exit policy should rather be mentioned in the party’s statute.” Had Nepali leaders internalised the spirit of the parliamentary system, their entry and exit points need not have been discussed. “The parliamentary system in Nepal has been vulgarised,” Pokharel added. According to political experts, despite the Congress leaders criticising the exit policy at the central committee, the proposal’s public appeal is growing. They see no alternative to its implementation, sooner or later. One reason for growing public disenchantment with political parties is that the same old faces have continued in leadership positions for a long time. If there were a term limit for a leader in a governmental or party position, people’s dissatisfaction would somehow be addressed.Experts say the recent political upheaval in Bangladesh and the political crisis of Sri Lanka two years ago were due to the continuous rule by a single person or a single family.One reason some democracies struggle is their political leaders’ unlimited hunger for power, Uddab Pyakurel, a political analyst, told the Post. “In Nordic countries, there is no need to set term limits for leaders as there is already a strong democratic culture there.” Despite having leaders like Donald Trump, American democracy still works, partly because of the term limits, Pyakurel reasoned. “If Nepal is to strengthen its democratic system, it must implement the exit policy for political leaders,” he said. Some political experts see problems even after introducing a term limit.Arguing that limiting the tenure for top positions alone is not enough to put curbs on autocratic tendencies, Khagendra Prasai, another political analyst, said: “The major issue is developing political mannerism and culture.”Calls for the top party leadership making way for a new generation are growing not just in the Congress. Even during the CPN (Maoist Centre) standing committee meeting last month, Deputy General Secretary Janardan Sharma questioned Pushpa Kamal Dahal’s uninterrupted leadership for nearly 35 years. Sharma even urged Dahal to resign the position. Experts say leaders with limited terms realise they must get a lot done within the given time at the top. There is no slow cooldown period. The current set of top party leaders—Deuba, Oli and Dahal in particular—have been in power for two or three decades, repeatedly assuming the country’s top executive position. Article 216 (7) of the Constitution of Nepal says a person elected mayor for two terms will not be eligible to be a candidate in future municipal elections. Article 215 (7) has a similar provision for chairpersons of rural municipalities.The constitution also has a two-term limit for President.While all other top governing posts come with fixed terms, there are limits on how many times the prime minister, chief ministers, ministers, and lawmakers can serve. This allows politicians to occupy office for as long as they choose, preventing the leadership handover to the next generation. In the view of Mighendra Bahadur Karki, executive director of the Centre for Nepal and Asia Studies (CNAS) at Tribhuvan University: “Leaders who know that their peers, even junior colleagues, may someday be their supervisors may be more thoughtful of their behaviour. Poor behaviour and status anxiety might be reduced, increasing the room for collaboration.” If senior leaders know that they need to bow out of the government or the party after a particular time, they are more likely to train and promote junior leaders to take their place, Karki told the Post. “This in turn will cultivate a healthy political culture.”But he warned that the question of term limit is not straightforward. “The exit policy, if it is to be implemented, should be system-centric rather than targeting particular leaders.” \nEven in the era of the meteoric rise of ultra-right politics globally, Nepal is among a few countries whose politics is dominated by socialists of different shades. From democratic socialists to moderate Leftists to Marxists and Bolsheviks to Bolivarans, all dream of establishing a classless society under a single-party dictatorship. Not being a socialist in this country is a political sacrilege and, ostensibly, becoming anti-development, if not outrightly anti-national. Nevertheless, almost all of these pipe dreamers have accepted the “mainstream” adult franchise-based parliamentary democracy.Not being socialist also (perhaps) goes against the Constitution. This is because, in at least three instances, The Constitution of Nepal 2015 categorically mentions the term “socialism” while defining the nature of the Nepali state. The preamble states that the constitution was issued as its formulator, the Constituent Assembly, was “committed to socialism”. Article 4(1) defines the State of Nepal as “an independent, indivisible, sovereign, secular, inclusive, democratic, socialism-oriented, federal democratic republican state”. Under the Directive Principles (Article 50, Clause 3), the objective of the State is “to develop a socialism-oriented independent and prosperous economy.” Tragically, the constitution has skipped the definition of the term “socialism”, making it a paradise for the interpretation of convenience.Political stunts often resurface to save socialism from falling from grace. When Pushpa Kamal Dahal, the chairman of the CPN (Maoist Centre), was prime minister, he formed a socialist front last January, including three other left parties—Janata Samajbadi Party, CPN (Unified Socialist) and CPN (Biplov). Now out of power, Dahal is trying to bring other fringe parties into the fold for a more organised opposition to the current government. There have been several efforts in history to unite the so-called socialists. But in practice, opportunism has homogenised Nepal’s every political outfit into a power-hungry brute force without principle, let alone ideology. The travesty, however, is that the fundamental allegation to demean one party by the other, mainly among the communist parties, is “the blatant abandonment of the principles of socialism.”Outdated narrativesSocialism takes refuge in utterly outdated socioeconomics and ecopolitical narratives for its survival. The overarching prescription is that the state must not only provide free health and education but also reduce the private sector’s role in the economy. The constitution includes free education up to the secondary level, free basic health care and gainful employment as fundamental rights. The socialists see all economic and political ills as the outcome of engulfing trends of liberalisation and globalisation. They still advocate for land reform that ensures entitlement of the “land to the tiller”. However, in reality, the younger generation is unwilling to own farms as they are moving away from agriculture to modern sectors of employment and entrepreneurship. Huge amounts of fertile land are increasingly being left uncultivated for want of people opting for farming. Besides, the unplanned drive of land fragmentation has converted entire farmlands into unfeasible patches for commercial-scale production of agricultural products. Failed land use planning and haphazard urbanisation have further eroded the prospects of the land used for agriculture.The pro-socialist crusade may not have appeared vocal to stop the privatisation of highly loss-making state-owned enterprises, stall private sector economic reforms and discontinue the centralised planning process, but they have crept into every aspect of economic policy-making. As a result, the economy is persistently left without a development model, and growth has stagnated beyond endurance. Nepal’s market integration with even the regional market is very limited, and the economy, seemingly irreversibly, becomes import-dependent, draining out capital and young brains.RamificationsThe discourse itself is anachronistic. The political parties are not competing to be forward-looking and pro-reform but to prove themselves purer socialists than others. This is rapidly disconnecting the political parties from the political system the country has adopted at a great opportunity cost and from the economic system that must generate output to increase public well-being.Philosophically, socialism with intended control of the state is the opposite pole to federalism, which seeks to devolve political and economic power closer to the masses. But most of Nepal’s political parties are playing devout socialists and ardent federalists. So, it is no surprise that federalism has been able to produce only suboptimal results during the last seven years of its implementation. The subnational political and administrative units created akin to the federal setup for all practical purposes remain subservient to the power concentrated at the centre. The concept of the controlling “central” government is finding it hard to convert into a coordinating “federal” government.The socialist idea of every facility being financed by the state certainly looks benign on the surface. This simply means the state treasury has to be adequately filled and continuously replenished to fulfil all existing public demands for services and facilities and be enough to meet future aspirations for improved quality of life. Without a reliable revenue source, the state can neither finance better public delivery nor develop infrastructure for the future. Nepal is now exactly in this trap.The real paradox of the socialist model of state-managed economy lies exactly here. Revenue on a convincing scale can only be generated if private sector investment substantially increases productivity, profit, employment and personal income. The state financing everything, even if it becomes a basic right included in the constitution, is impossible without making the market economy sizable, vibrant and capable of paying taxes. Such a market is impossible to imagine without unhindered private sector investment. Foreign investment is the new paradigm in the economies with comparative advantage. However, the very idea of a state-controlled socialist economy is perhaps enough to turn the heads of foreign investors away from the economy in question.Even Karl Marx’s Das Kapital advocated for the highest level of capital growth for extreme exploitation to explode into revolution. However, Nepali socialists didn't even recognise the importance of the inevitable expansion of capital for a state. The state apparatus has evolved since Marx to prevent extreme exploitation. Also, capitalists need not be exterminated by violence but can be constructively made liable to duly paying tax to the state.   \nMaya, a 36-year-old single mother from Babarmahal, Kathmandu never imagined that a polite rejection on Facebook two months ago would spiral into a living nightmare.Maya (her real name has been changed to protect her identity) became the target of an online stalker after she rejected a man’s advances. What started as a few friendly messages on social media quickly took a dark turn when the man demanded nude photos of her, which she refused to send.Unfazed, he started sending her unsolicited explicit images of himself. He then began tracking her online activity, leaving threatening messages, and eventually, he found her home address. “I would receive messages saying he was watching me, that he knew where my son went to school,” Maya told the Post. Despite blocking him multiple times, the stalker always found a way to reappear, using different accounts to harass her. Fearing for her nine-year-old son’s safety, she finally mustered the courage to file a complaint with the Cyber Bureau of Nepal Police 15 days ago.Since informing the stalker that she had taken legal action, he has not contacted her again, but the experience has left her feeling paranoid and anxious. She now fears leaving her home and hesitates to go online. “I just want to feel safe again, but I’m not sure if that’s possible anymore,” Maya says.Maya’s ordeal speaks volumes about how violence against women is no longer confined to physical spaces but has increasingly infiltrated the digital world in the form of online abuse, from revenge porn and bullying to sexual harassment, trolling, fraud, and blackmail.The severity of this issue becomes even clearer with data from the Cyber Bureau. In just under two months of the fiscal year 2024-25, the bureau has already recorded 882 cases of cybercrimes involving women. Looking back at previous years, the figures paint a troubling picture. In the fiscal year 2022-23, there were 9,013 reported cybercrime cases, with 4,590 filed by women. The period also saw 130 cases involving minor girls. The following year, 2023-24, witnessed a dramatic rise in the number of cases involving women to 8,745 and those involving minors to 382. This represents an increase of approximately 90.52 percent in cyber violence cases reported by women from 2022-23 to 2023-24.As the country entered a new fiscal year, the trend of online violence continues, with the bureau already reporting 35 cases involving minor girls and 882 cases involving adult women. However, these numbers alone do not capture the full extent of women’s and girls’ vulnerability in the digital space. Traditional beliefs, discrimination, and the normalisation of such behaviour, along with the fear that exposing abuse will shame them and their families, often lead to many cases going unreported.Rita, a 27-year-old woman, from Sunsari whom the Post is identifying with a pseudonym, is one such victim. She never imagined that a relationship she once cherished would end up destroying her life. After a difficult breakup, her ex-partner with whom she had a live-in relationship, sought revenge by sharing intimate videos and photos of her online with her family, friends, and relatives in 2022.For the next six months, her ex continued to sexually harass her through social media. The abuse only ceased after she attempted suicide, which resulted in a three-week hospitalisation.“Even after all this happened, my family refused to help me file a complaint. My relatives even mocked me, saying that I had already done intimate things during the live-in relationship. They said he wasn’t physically hurting or abusing me, so I should just get over it”, says Rita.According to a UN report based on studies in 10 countries, an estimated 95 percent of aggressive behaviour, harassment, abusive language, and degrading images online are directed at women, and they often come from partners or ex-partners.A year has passed for Rita, but the emotional scars remain, and she continues to struggle with depression.Many in Nepal, like Rita’s relatives, downplay the impact of online harassment, dismissing it as “just virtual, not physical.” However, a UN report titled ‘Combating Online Violence Against Women & Girls: A Worldwide Wake-Up Call,’ published by the UN Broadband Commission in 2015, tells a different story. It argues that ‘cyber touch’ can be as damaging as physical touch, suggesting that online abuse can be as bad as domestic violence or sexual assault.Now, as women across Nepal are celebrating Teej, many find themselves facing online violence. They are subjected to a barrage of hate speech simply for enjoying themselves.In recent years, the sight of women dancing, singing, drinking, and celebrating during Teej has sparked outrage among certain segments of society, particularly men who see these activities as a challenge to traditional gender roles. Social media trolls have seized on the opportunity to attack and criticise what they consider ‘inappropriate behaviour, clothing, and dance.’“Every year, it’s the same story,” says Ankita Chapagain, a 40-year-old from Kathmandu. “As soon as videos of women enjoying Teej and dancing go online, the hate comments start pouring in. We’re called names, our morals are questioned, and we’re blamed for the supposed degradation of society.”This animosity extends beyond anonymous trolls; it mirrors a deeper social unease with women’s independence and the pervasive misogyny and patriarchy in our culture. “It’s as if they can’t stand to see women happy and celebrating on their own terms,” Chapagain adds.The problem intensifies during elections, with female politicians facing significant online abuse. An analysis conducted by Panos South Asia reveals that insults and hate speech are the most common attacks on female politicians.A joint statement by the United Nations Special Rapporteurs on Violence against Women and Freedom of Expression says online violence against women can “chill and disrupt the online participation of women journalists, activists, human rights defenders, artists, and other public figures and private individuals” —which underscores the severe impact of growing cyber violence.So, how well-prepared are the institutions responsible for addressing this issue, like the Cyber Bureau? The answer seems to be, not very well.Superintendent of Police Deepak Raj Awasthi, spokesperson, and information officer of the Cyber Bureau, told the Post last month that the bureau is struggling with both understaffing and underfunding.The gap between the rise in cybercrimes and the lack of resources leaves the virtual realm a dangerous space, especially for girls and women who are already vulnerable due to unsafe physical environments, pervasive misogyny, and systemic discrimination. \nRae was the envoy to Kathmandu during the promulgation of the 2015 constitution and the subsequent blockade. In this conversation, Rae talks about the evolution of Nepal-India ties since the blockade, regional geopolitics, what the two countries get wrong about each other, how New Delhi views Nepali communist parties and the governments they lead, and the change (if any) in India’s neighbourhood policy since the start of Narendra Modi’s third term in office. \nKunwar has been the MD for just under three years. Before coming back to her homeland to join Daraz Nepal, she worked at different American companies, including Amazon, the world’s biggest e-commerce platform. In this conversation, Kunwar talks about the opportunities and challenges of running an e-commerce enterprise in Nepal, as well as the country’s overall business environment.  \nWhen the Ranjitkar group was established, they discovered this forgotten dance and devoted two years to researching it.Now, they are reintroducing it during Indra Jatra by training the new generation in this traditional art form. \nHe is known for his nationalist legacy, marked by the amendment of Nepal's map to include territories like Kalapani, Lipulekh, and Limpiyadhura, and his strong stance against India, especially during and after the 2015 Nepal blockade.But how did he rise to become the country's powerful man? \nTanka Chaulagain is a theatre artist, writer, and director. He has directed various plays, such as ‘Romeo and Juliet’, ‘Charlie and the Chocolate Factory’, and ‘Matilda’. Chaulagain is also the founder of ‘Lalabala’, an acting platform for children. He has also authored several books, such as ‘Kathmandu Geet’, ‘Taalatuli’, and ‘Ubadkhaabad’.In this conversation with the Post’s Rishika Dhakal, Chaulagain discusses his newly published book ‘Rudane’. What is your recent book about?My latest book is based on the life of Rup Chandra Bista, a well-known political figure. It's a mix of biography and fiction. Since the book is autobiographical fiction, some readers have asked why I chose to fictionalise Bista’s life instead of writing a straightforward biography. As someone with a background in theatre and drama, I was drawn to the dramatic elements of his journey. While biography is bound by facts, which anyone can research and present, fiction allows me to explore, be creative, and let my imagination shape the narrative. This approach makes the story more engaging, so I opted for a fictionalised account of Rup Chandra Bista’s life.While writing fiction, there’s a concern that the emotional elements might overshadow the historical facts, potentially erasing them. So, how have you balanced these aspects to avoid distorting history?I was aware of the challenge this posed as a writer. I never met Rup Chandra Bista, so I can’t write about him from a personal perspective. Sometimes, it’s easy to exaggerate a person's character when trying to make the narrative more dramatic, making them seem different from who they truly were. To ensure I was fair in my portrayal, after finishing the draft, I gave it to Rup Chandra Bista’s nephew, Bhuwan Prakash Bista, for his review. He raised similar questions and suggested a few corrections.Taking his feedback seriously, I revised the manuscript several times, carefully considering what he was trying to convey. After four or five rounds of edits, I feel I was able to present a more accurate balance of Bista's personality.However, my portrayal is still based on my understanding of him as a charismatic leader. I gathered information by listening to people who knew him and reading articles about his life, but my depiction may not fully capture his philosophy. That’s why I called it fiction.Why did you write about Rup Chandra Bista?In 2020, I did a play about Yogmaya, which was well-received. Yogmaya advocated a ‘dharma rajya’—a just and righteous society. While searching for another figure with a similar revolutionary spirit, I came across Rup Chandra Bista, whose story captivated me. A film about Bista was planned then, but the project was halted for 3-4 years and eventually cancelled. One of my brothers suggested turning the story into a drama. However, I was more fascinated with the narrative itself, and instead of writing it for the stage, I chose to turn it into fiction. That’s how the idea for the book emerged.Another reason I decided to write about Bista is that, in today’s political landscape, I don't see any leader with a philosophy like his. Bista was a leader who connected with people from all social classes. He had a separate group for children, encouraging them to “Know”—his guiding motto. He believed that awareness was key to individual and societal change. He also formed a group for women and supported their causes.Although Bista came from a wealthy family, he chose to live among the poor. He worked alongside them, striving to enlighten and uplift the marginalised.Bista’s deep connection with people and unique vision drew me to his story, leading me to base my book on his life.How important is your new book in today’s political and social climate? Looking back at history, Rup Chandra Bista was a political figure who thrived within the system of his time, winning elections multiple times during the Panchayat era. Yet, he wasn't afraid to openly criticise the Panchayat governments for their wrongdoings. Despite his privileged background, Bista lived a simple life. He strongly believed in reusing things and always wore second-hand clothes. In today’s world, with issues like climate change and overuse of resources, Bista’s lifestyle should resonate with our society. Inspired by him, I’ve started sleeping on the floor to feel more connected to the Earth.Bista also spent two decades living with farmers in Sim Bhanjyang, where he grazed goats and cultivated potatoes and cauliflower to improve their livelihoods. His focus on uplifting the underprivileged reflected his belief that society can only progress when the most disadvantaged rise.Looking at Nepal’s current political situation—where there is no consensus among parties and governance feels disorganised—alongside society’s increasingly materialistic values, I believe this book is more relevant than ever.How has your background in drama influenced your approach to writing fiction?As a drama student, I naturally include a lot of dialogue in my fiction writing. Writers like Buddhisagar and Subin Bhattarai often focus on playing with words and descriptions, but in my process, I focus on creating scenes, establishing characters, and weaving in dialogues. For instance, my book ‘Rudane’ has plenty of dramatic dialogue. Without them, the book could have risked becoming a straightforward biography. However, the dialogue helped breathe life into the characters. Writing them and building scenes allowed me to bring the story to life.Writing drama in Nepal is particularly challenging. The play's audience is small, and there is no guarantee that it will reach its intended audience or be published and read. That's one of the reasons I shifted toward fiction writing. However, I still translate plays I enjoy, which helps me balance my love for both forms. Even in my fiction, especially in the dialogues, the influence of drama is quite evident.While fiction usually requires fewer dialogues than drama, writing both involves building vivid scenes. For example, when writing a scene with four characters in a café, I instinctively imagine the entire setting, down to the smallest details. My background in drama has been invaluable in this regard, as it has helped me visualise scenes more easily and bring them to life in my fiction.What message do you want to convey to readers through your book? Rup Chandra Bista's life offers many valuable lessons. He believed in living a minimalist lifestyle and prioritised using Nepali products. Bista often wore clothes, bags, and other items made from burlap sacks. Despite being offered prestigious jobs, including one by Juddha Shumsher, he always put the well-being of others before his own.In contrast, today's generation often focuses more on personal gains than thinking of others. Through my book, I hope readers will learn from Bista’s selfless lifestyle and reflect on how they can also think about the needs of others. Bista was a man of strong principles and died on his terms. His statement, “Those I tried to awaken never did. Those who were awakened only ended up supporting the opposition,” reflects his deep frustration with the political system of his time.Beyond the political and social lessons, Bista's life, as shared through various articles and stories, offers timeless insights into leadership, selflessness, and the pursuit of justice for all.Tanka Chaulagain’s book recommendationsSotalaAuthor: Dor Bahadur BistaPublisher: Sajha PrakashanYear: 1976Bista's work captures a bygone era when many Nepalis journeyed to Tibet for the salt trade, offering readers a glimpse into Nepali society at that time.Lamppost Bata Khaseko JoonAuthor: Manu ManjilPublisher: FinePrintYear: 2011This poetry collection features forty-six free verse poems and the book is known for its portrayal of contemporary Nepali culture.Mantha Darayeko JugAuthor: Mohan Mainali Publisher: Heritage Publishers and DistributorYear: 2015This book chronicles the lives of those who were killed during the war, highlighting their valiant efforts to protect themselves and their families.YashodharaAuthor: Haribol KaflePublisher: Lipi BooksYear: 2023Told from Yashodhara's perspective, this novel provides a fresh view of Siddhartha's journey to becoming the Buddha.UlarAuthor: Nayanraj PandeyPublisher: Tanneri PrakashanYear: 1998This book is a window into the harsh reality of politics and people who have suffered from political instability. \nRepresentatives at the first national conference of the Rastriya Swatantra Party saw factionalism within the party.Some of the representatives who arrived in Kathmandu three days ago for the two-day gathering starting on Tuesday said that growing factionalism is not healthy for the new political outfit promising to challenge traditional forces like the Nepali Congress and the CPN-UML.“We were told that factionalism existed in our party in various forms, but we denied such claims. However, during our three days in Kathmandu, we witnessed it,” a group of party members told the Post. It seems that President Rabi Lamichhane and Vice-president Swarnim Wagle are not in the same boat on how the party should function, they added.RSP acting spokesperson Manish Jha explains that it is the lack of synchronisation—rather than differences—between the leaders. “People from various schools of thought came together to form the RSP. It is true that we lack synchronisation, but it would be wrong to portray it as differences.”Another leader of the party said on condition of anonymity that the party has two schools of thought—one based on democratic principles and the other opposed to it.RSP acting general secretary Kabindra Burlakoti claims that the party is united.In conversations with the Post, representatives from Kathmandu Valley, Pokhara and Chitwan sounded more optimistic with the central leadership while those from remote areas were confused over their take on the party’s central leadership.The representatives from Madhesh were mild in their opinion about the leadership.Moreover, representatives were also not very positive about the way the central leadership is investing their energy to claim that Lamichhane had got a clean chit from the parliamentary special committee formed to investigate crisis-ridden cooperatives.The probe panel, which submitted its report to the House of Representatives, has recommended the government prosecute Lamichhane, along with his former business partner GB (Gitendra Babu) Rai, board member of the media Kumar Ramtel and initial founder Chhabi Lal Joshi as per the prevailing laws. The inquiry committee, however, has said it couldn’t establish Lamichhane’s role in rerouting the cooperatives fund to Gorkha Media Network.“It would have been better had the central leadership waited to see how the government would take action,” the group of representatives from western Nepal told the Post. “In case Lamichhane is booked under the law, it could be counterproductive for the party in the long run.”The political campaign started by the RSP won’t get stalled even without Lamichhane, the representatives said, expressing their confidence in the party’s longevity.Lamichhane also presented a political report incorporating proposed statutory changes, the party’s commitments to voters, policy agenda presented by Swarnim Wagle at the Jaleshwar meeting and the conclusion drawn from the closed session of the national conference.Lamichhane’s report states that the policy paper presented in Jaleshwar defined ‘constitutional socialism’ as the party’s political ideology. Lamichhane also accuses the ruling Nepali Congress and CPN-UML of trying to lead the country to a two-party system by polarising smaller parties. “On the pretext of administrative reform, they are planning to wipe out the existence of small parties,” the report reads. “Potentially, this step can bring together new parties that want to be an alternative political force sooner or later.”Asked about RSP’s possible alliance with other parties, Burlakoti said though they are not in talks with the main opposition CPN (Maoist Centre), they are in regular contact with several independent candidates of last election.Asked if they are in discussion with Kathmandu Metropolitan City Mayor Balendra Shah, who won the 2022 local election independently, Burlakoti said: “Strategic moves are not to be disclosed.”However, when the national conference concluded after Lamichhane presented his report, representatives arriving from around the country were displeased.“This is not the way a party functions,” a representative told the Post, asking not to be named for fears of reprisal.When leaders put themselves at the centre and cadres in the periphery, the party’s downfall begins, another representative said. Acting General Secretary Burlakoti, however, defended the party leadership. “Our national conference was designed this way,” Burlakoti said. The report presented by the chair will be discussed in the party’s Mahakali-Mechi campaign that will start soon, he added.“At the national conference, we gave 5 percent of the total representatives (1500) time to speak, but those who spoke exceeded that number,” Burlakoti said.The conference, however, passed Lamichhane’s report. On Wednesday, Lamichhane announced the date of the party’s first general convention. It will be held on May 8-10 at a yet-undecided venue.“I would like to inform you that the Central Committee has become the general convention organising committee,” Burlakoti said. Lamichhane also announced the ‘Mahakali-Mechi Campaign’ to interact with the general public.In his report, Lamichhane has proposed a person not affiliated to any party to be elected the country’s president, directly elected executive head, or the prime minister. He also proposes giving the nation’s vice president the responsibility to chair the National Assembly.While the paper bats for a fully proportional electoral system, it says provincial assemblies cannot be accepted in the current shape.However, this does not mean the RSP is against the federal structure gained through the sacrifice of thousands of people, another representative said. “Our party has no strength to amend the constitution and scrap the federal structure. Therefore, for the time being, voices are growing among the party members about accepting the present political structure,” Khemraj Koirala, a conference representative from Kailali told the Post.Party members also suggested downsizing the number of ministers to make the provincial system functional, Koirala said.The report also stands for reducing the number of municipalities to less than 500, from the current 753. \nRastriya Swatantra Party chair Rabi Lamichhane, addressing a two-day national conference of the party's central council that started on Tuesday, said that the emergence of the RSP has been a headache for Nepal’s traditional political parties.“Until we win a majority in the next election, their headache will continue,” Lamichhane said. “Some people think that if Rabi Lamichhane is defeated, then the role of RSP in national politics will shrink. However, with or without Rabi, RSP now will move ahead as a campaign.”At the national conference of central council members, all seven provincial committees presented their reports. In the process, some committees briefed the RSP on the financial difficulties they are facing to run their day-to-day activities, whereas others hinted at the challenges they are facing building the party organisation.Party’s Koshi provincial president Rajesh Timilsina said there are 25,000 RSP cadres in the province. Due to irregular levy payments from cadres, it had been difficult to run the party.“We now face the challenge in expanding the party’s membership base,” a party leader quoted Timilsina as saying. There were more people frustrated with the party’s activities than those attracted to it.Timilsina also called for a regular financial source to carry out party activities, the leader said.RSP provincial president for Madhesh Tapeshwar Yadav presented a report depicting the party in good light in the province. “If general elections were to be held now, our party would either lead the province or take the main opposition position,” a party insider told the Post, quoting Yadav.Achyut Lamichhane, the provincial chief of Bagmati, claimed that the leadership had expanded the membership in Chitwan and Kathmandu by 7,000 and 5,000, respectively.Party’s Lumbini committee chief Devraj Pathak, presenting the provincial report, said that a funds crunch had hampered the committee’s activities. In Karnali, the RSP is tackling geographical difficulties in welcoming more members to the party. Sudurpaschim party chief also briefed the leadership on the difficulties the provincial committee is facing in expanding the membership, the party leaders said.The financial report presented by RSP treasurer Lima Adhikari suggests that the party’s income totalled Rs34 million in the fiscal year 2023-2024. The amount includes membership fee, donations, sale of publicity materials, and interest on deposits, among other sources. According to RSP leaders, at least 50 representatives expressed their opinions in the ‘open session’ on Tuesday. They suggested that the leadership should be protected from external attacks, and the party chair should be allowed to form a team so as to ease the party’s operation.Vice-chair Swarnim Wagle presented a brief explanation on the ‘policy paper’ endorsed by the party’s Jaleshwar meeting last year.Acting General Secretary Kabindra Burlakoti presented a proposal for amending the party statute. Burlakoti proposes three vice-presidents and joint general secretaries, including a woman in each position.Apart from the treasurer and spokesperson, all the office bearers are also proposed to be directly elected.Though the party called its first national conference to discuss a wide array of issues, the report submitted by the parliamentary special probe committee on Monday dominated the discourse.The report on crisis-ridden cooperatives, submitted to the government via the Speaker of the House of Representatives, also concerns the fate of RSP President Rabi Lamichhane. Though the report does not directly implicate Lamichhane in the cooperatives fraud, it links him to the spending of the money illegally sourced from multiple cooperatives. The report also recommended prosecuting four individuals: Lamichhane, then-managing director of Gorkha Media Network; chairman Gitendra Babu (GB) Rai; board member Kumar Ramtel; and initial founder Chhabi Lal Joshi.Lamichhane was accused of diverting funds from multiple cooperatives to run the media company that operated the Galaxy 4K Television channel, which ceased operations last year. Rai and Lamichhane co-founded and jointly ran the media company before Lamichhane joined politics in June 2022.Lamichhane also claims to have held 15 percent of sweat shares in the company, which he sold after completing the legal procedure as he quit the television. However, the committee’s investigation found those claims to be false. Denying his involvement in the cooperatives scam, Lamichhane and other RSP lawmakers attacked the Nepali Congress for its repeated stance that led to the parliamentary committee’s formation.RSP leaders at the meeting tried to establish that Lamichhane had got a clean chit from the probe.Before concluding the conference on Wednesday, Lamichhane will present his political report. This conference is also expected to schedule the party’s first general convention for May next year. \nThe parliamentary special probe committee formed to investigate crisis-ridden cooperatives has concluded that Rabi Lamichhane, the chairman of the Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP), was involved in misusing millions of rupees received from cooperatives when he was the managing director of the now defunct Gorkha Media Network.The committee’s report recommends that the government take action against former deputy prime minister and home minister Lamichhane for the act.Lamichhane was accused of diverting funds from multiple cooperatives to run the media company that operated the Galaxy 4K Television channel, which ceased operations last year. Chairman GB (Gitendra Babu) Rai and managing director Lamichhane co-founded and jointly ran the media company before Lamichhane joined politics in June 2022.“During our investigation, we found that the investment in the Gorkha Media Network had been made with the money diverted from various cooperatives,” Ishwari Devi Neupane, a Nepali Congress member of the probe committee, told the Post. “Although Lamichhane has been found guilty of using funds from cooperatives for Gorkha Media Network, it could not directly link him to the rerouting of cooperative funds.”Lamichhane has consistently denied any involvement in the misappropriation of cooperative funds. However, the report of the parliamentary special committee formed to investigate crisis-ridden cooperatives has concluded that Rs650 million from five credit cooperatives, including the Pokhara-based Surya Darshan Cooperative, Butwal-based Supreme Cooperatives, Chitwan-based Sahara Cooperatives, Birgunj-based Sano Paila Cooperatives, and Kathmandu-based Swarnalaxmi Cooperatives, were diverted to the Gorkha Media Network.The committee’s report, which was submitted to Speaker Devraj Ghimire at a meeting of the House of Representatives on Monday, recommends prosecuting four individuals, including Lamichhane, the then managing director of Gorkha Media Network; chairman Gitendra Babu (GB) Rai; a board member Kumar Ramtel; and initial founder Chhabi Lal Joshi.“Those in the roles of shareholders, board members and managing director can’t evade accountability and liability for the money that comes into the company,” reads the report submitted by the chair of the probe panel, CPN-UML lawmaker Surya Thapa. It states that the bank account holders who operate the account should be responsible for how the money in that account is used. “Since Rai, Ramtel, Lamichhane and Joshi are seen to be using the money that came into the company from various cooperatives, we recommend that the Nepal government prosecute them in accordance with the prevailing laws,” the report further says. An Interpol diffusion notice has been issued against Rai, who has been on the run and is believed to be abroad. Ramtel is in judicial custody.The probe panel has also recommended that the government make binding legal arrangements for the payment for share purchases and sales. The report also suggests that the government make proper legal arrangements concerning sweat shares and prompt relevant agencies to address the matter. Lamichhane claimed to have held 15 percent of sweat shares in the company, which he said he sold after completing all legal procedures. However, the committee’s investigation found those claims to be false. “Forgery was involved in the purchase and sale of sweat shares,” Lekhnath Dahal, the CPN (Maoist Centre) lawmaker and committee member, told the Post. The report states that the office bearers of the media company had used forged documents while transferring the company’s shares, and recommends that the government carry out further investigation of the matter and take necessary actions.However, RSP leaders had their own interpretation of the probe committee’s report.RSP chair Lamichhane and Vice-chair Swarnim Wagle, while leaving the House meeting, claimed that the committee had acquitted Lamichhane of the allegations that he was involved in embezzlement of cooperative funds. They said they welcome the committee’s report, and noted that Shishir Khanal, the RSP member in the committee, did not even write a note of dissent “as the report had exonerated the party chair”.RSP leaders also claimed that the accusations from other parties had been proved false.Manish Jha, acting spokesperson of the RSP, said that even Congress General Secretary Gagan Thapa had claimed that Lamichhane was directly involved in diverting cooperative funds to the media company using his own signature. Jha claimed that the report disproves this accusation. “We had acknowledged that Gorkha Media Network had diverted the cooperative funds for its operation, which the report confirms,” he added.“We had assumed the report might do great damage to our party, but we are pleased how it has been presented,” Jha told the Post. “Things will become clearer after the full report is made public.”But committee members don’t agree with the RSP leaders’ interpretation. “They may have assumed that their party chair would be directly implicated, but that did not happen,” said Dhruba Bahadur Pradhan, a Rastriya Prajantra Party (RPP) lawmaker and committee member. He said that not being directly implicated does not mean that he was not involved in the scam. “Our law does not permit the rerouting of the cooperative funds to a private company, yet Lamichhane and the company did exactly that. He can be prosecuted for this,” Pradhan, who is also a former chief of Nepal Police, told the Post.Legal experts say that Lamichhane could face prosecution under four different laws based on the findings of the parliamentary special inquiry committee’s report. “Lamichhane could be charged the cooperative fraud case under the Cooperative Act, fraud and duping under the National Penal Code, organised crime cases under the Organised Crime Prevention Act and money laundering case under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act,” advocate Om Parkash Aryal told the Post.The committee was formed on May 28 and had four-point terms of reference to investigate cooperative funds embezzlement. Among the four-point ToR, the cooperatives linked with the funding of the now-defunct Gorkha Media Network will also be probed.The probe panel had three months to complete its work from the first day of the committee meeting which was held a week later after the committee’s formation. When the committee could not complete its task in the given time, Parliament had extended the term by 15 days, to September 22. But the committee has submitted its report before the expiry of the extended time. Speaker Devraj Ghimire forwarded the report to the government for implementation after committee chair Thapa submitted it to the House of Representatives on Monday.The lower house formed the special inquiry committee after the erstwhile main opposition party Nepali Congress obstructed House meetings continuously for weeks demanding the formation of such a panel.The Congress, along with the RPP, demanded a parliamentary special probe committee to investigate the cooperative embezzlement, claiming involvement of the then deputy prime minister and home minister Lamichhane. The then ruling parties the CPN (Maoist Centre), the major coalition partners UML and Lamichhne’s RSP were against the demand.Lamichhane, host of a popular television show, founded the RSP in June 2022. RSP is the fourth largest party in Parliament with 21 lawmakers (including deputy speaker).He is linked with multiple controversies. His case regarding the use of dual passports is sub judice. He was also stripped of his position as a lawmaker and minister for home affairs in early 2023 after he was found guilty of contesting the 2022 election without proper Nepali citizenship. Lamichhane had obtained an American green card, but contested the election in Chitwan-2 without first re-acquiring Nepali citizenship. He won by a huge margin. Lamichhane, who had been stripped of the lawmaker position on charges of using dual citizenship, got reelected as the lawmaker from the same constituency in a by-election held in 2023. Similarly, the parliamentary special probe committee has recommended that the government investigate Jyoti Gurung, former wife of Nepali Congress Vice President and lawmaker Dhan Raj Gurung. Jyoti Gurung, who was a board member of Miteri Cooperative, is accused of mishandling more than Rs120 million of the cooperative’s funds. “The Miteri cooperative chairman, Khumbharaj Gurung, had complained to the committee about Dhan Raj Gurung and his wife over their mishandling of the cooperative's money,” Pradhan said. “So the committee report has recommended further investigation into the Gurungs.” On Friday, the special committee members visited the Miteri Cooperatives office at Mahalaxmisthan in Lalitpur, to discuss the matter with its chairman.After being charged with embezzling the cooperative’s funds, Congress Vice President Gurung, speaking in Parliament on September 10, called for a thorough probe to clear his name. Pradhan said the committee found no evidence implicating lawmaker Gurung in the misappropriation. Cooperatives are considered to be self-regulatory bodies, but in Nepal a large number of cooperatives are being operated arbitrarily by a handful of operators. The committee report also suggests that the government should establish a strong regulatory body to look after the financial aspect of cooperatives.Apart from chair Thapa the committee had six other members. Sarita Bhusal from the UML; Dilendra Prasad Badu and Ishwari Devi Neupane from the Congress; Lekhnath Dahal from Maoist Centre; Sishir Khanal from RSP and Dhruba Bahadur Pradhan from RPP. \nPanic gripped locals in ward 12 of Chandragiri Municipality, Kathmandu, on Thursday morning after a suspicious object was found in the locality.The suspicious object was spotted in front of Balambu Secondary School, sparking fears of a bomb threat.Locals informed the police, and a bomb disposal team from the Nepal Army arrived at the scene. According to the NA Directorate of Public Relations and Information, the team disposed of the suspicious object, which turned out to be a pressure cooker.   \nKathmandu Metropolitan City has extended the area to prohibit building any structure on either side of the rivers in its territory.In a notice on Wednesday, the city office stated that construction of any structure has been barred on the additional 20 meters from the existing prohibited area.According to the metropolis notice, if the city has, under the existing rule, prohibited any construction on 20 meters from the area marked as river, the prohibited area will now be altogether 40 meters on either side of the waterway.The metropolis said the decision was taken based on a recent Supreme Court verdict that directed the authorities concerned to prohibit construction within an additional 20 metres from riverbanks in the Kathmandu Valley.Currently, construction is permitted only 20 metres beyond major riverbanks in the Kathmandu metropolis.The notice issued by the metropolis states, “No construction will be permitted on an additional 20 metres of land on either side of the river, and ongoing construction will be halted.”It has also asked one and all not to release contaminated water, including sewage, into Bagmati River and its tributaries. “Private and government buildings, as well as commercial properties, must install soak pits for groundwater recharge,” it said. “Waste must not be disposed of in the rivers. Non-compliance will lead to legal action under existing laws.” \nThe rhythmic beat of the Dha echoes through a Bhaktapur alley, blending with the energetic footsteps of dancers. Bhaktapur, which sees jatras and festivals round the year, is no stranger to music, dance and celebrations. But this is not an ordinary occasion. The performers in question are Lakhe dancers who are reviving the Ranjitkar Lakhe dance after a century.The young dancers are preparing for Indra Jatra this year, where mask-clad Lakhe dancers roam the streets to rid the community of hardships and suffering. Lakhe, demon deities revered as protectors of people and crops, are thought to reside in the demonic mask. As the dancer dons the mask, the spirit is said to take over.Bhaktapur was once a key site for the Ranjitkar Lakhe performances, but the art form vanished from the city after the 1934 earthquake.“Bhaktapur suffered the most damage during the 1934 earthquake,\" says Ganesh Ram Ranjit, treasurer of the Ranjitkar Group’s Bhaktapur branch. “The destruction left residents struggling to recover for a decade, making it nearly impossible to perform the costly Lakhe dance.”The Ranjitkar Group discovered the extinct dance in the year the group was established. They located a Lakhe temple in Bhaktapur that had closed after the earthquake. After two years of research, they learned that performing the Lakhe dance was seen as a good omen in Bhaktapur and involved hosting community feasts. However, the high cost of this tradition forced many to sell their properties, rendering it unfeasible in the city’s post-earthquake conditions. Over time, the dance was abandoned as more lands supporting these cultural events were lost during rapid urbanisation.“There was a significant decline in our engagement with our cultural heritage,” says Rabi Shakya, a sculptor and Lakhe dance teacher training the new dancers. “The encouraging change now is the strong interest from the new generation, which is making it possible to revive intangible heritage like this dance.”After 100 years, the Ranjitkar Lakhe Dance is making a return to Bhaktapur at this year’s Indra Jatra.“It’s challenging to accurately re-enact the dance since it hasn’t been seen in a century,” Shakya notes. “As a sculptor, I drew inspiration from Bhaktapur’s revered Shree Navadurga Bhawani to create the Lakhe’s mask.” Similarly, the dance was choreographed by studying Lakhe dances from Kathmandu, Patan, and Banepa within the Ranjitkar community, and combining them with traditional steps from Bhaktapur Lakhe dances.“As for the musical instruments, we are using traditional instruments like Dha, Dhime, and Ponga, which are said to excite the Lakhe,” says Rajendra Maharjan, Lakhe dance teacher and musician.Maharjan is one of the experienced Newari arts teachers working to revive the lost Lakhe dance. He is involved in training young students in cultural arts and is now dedicated to the Ranjitkar dance training, with the students practising together nearly every day.“Becoming a Lakhe performer involves more than just wearing the costume and mask,” said Sudin Ranjit, a Lakhe dance student. “We must train extensively with our teachers, and it demands a lot of hard work.”To Ranjit, a resident of Bhaktapur, the training is more than learning a new craft; it is a matter of protecting culture. Growing up only interested in instruments, he slowly understood how important continuing cultural practices like Lakhe dances is for their community.“The dance will not only bolster Bhaktapur’s cultural pride but also boost tourism and create jobs,” says Dr Purushottam Lochan Shrestha, a professor and researcher specialising in Bhaktapur and Newari culture.Shrestha notes that reviving the dance would offer employment to everyone involved, from the dancers and the sculptor making the masks to those participating in the rituals. “Economic centres throughout the city, from small businesses to large industries, will benefit from the influx of tourists attracted by the Lakhe dance,” Shrestha adds, commending the Ranjitkar group's initiative.Once the Ranjitkar community revitalises the Lakhe dance, the Ranjitkar group plans to set up a new Guthi house with a fresh community fund and organise annual events for the dance.“The Lakhe dance won’t let them separate,” Shakya remarks.In today’s globalised world, where identity often merges into a homogenised blend, shared cultural practices provide a sense of connection and belonging. This new Lakhe dance embodies that spirit of togetherness for the community involved.“Reviving the dance after 100 years,” Shakya says, “is about preserving our culture for the next 300 years.” \nThe Lions Club of Kathmandu Corporate, Nepal MD325-D has felicitated various personalities as part of its endeavour to recognise the contribution of the individuals and business entities for the society.As part of its campaign, the Lions Club of Kathmandu honoured Prateek Pradhan with Social Journalism Award, Sylapa T Rimponche with Social Spiritual Award, Erika Gurung with Social Player Award, Ramesh Corporation with Social Corporate House Award, Rajendra Malla with Social Corporate Leader Award and Rajesh Hamal with Social Celebrity Award.Likewise, Chandra Ghimire is honoured with Social Bureaucratic Award, Binod Das with Sports Management Award, Anil Kedia with Social Academic Award, Mohan Ojha with Social Management Award and Surya Nepal with Corporate Social Responsibility Award.The Lionism embarked in Nepal in 1971 as the Lions Club of Biratnagar under the stewardship of former Prime Minister Matrika Prasad Koirala.The Lions Clubs International says it has over 2,000 clubs operating across the nation. \nThe government has declared a public holiday in the Kathmandu Valley on Sunday to celebrate the Bhoto Jatra.On the occasion of the festival, a public holiday has been declared in the three districts of Kathmandu Valley [Kathmandu, Lalitpur, and Bhaktapur], according to a statement by Narayan Prasad Bhattarai, spokesperson for the Ministry of Home Affairs, on Friday.The government announces a public holiday each year on this occasion.The month-long chariot-pulling festival of Rato Machhindranath concludes with the displaying of a bhoto (a jewel-studded vest) at Jawalakhel, Lalitpur. It is an annual cultural and religious ritual of displaying the black jewel-studded vest believed to be of then Nagraj, the serpent King.Machhindranath is revered as the God of rain, good harvest and prosperity. Paying homage to Lord Machhindranath is believed to bring good luck and fulfil one’s wishes. \n\nThe Nepal-India Chamber of Commerce & Industry (NICCI) participated in the Bodhgaya-Nalanda Conference—BIMSTEC Plus, which was organised by the Synergia Foundation in collaboration with Nalanda University in Bihar, India, on September 12.Sunil KC, vice-president of NICCI, representing the Nepali delegation, attended the three-day event. KC emphasised the importance of cultural and economic integration among BIMSTEC nations while speaking at the event session entitled, ‘Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation (BIMSTEC) Plus: Shared Cultural Values and Futures’.He highlighted how the BIMSTEC bridges South and Southeast Asia, fostering a deep-rooted connection through shared historical values and economic ties.KC underscored the vital role of culture in regional development, noting that shared cultural heritage can drive economic collaboration, particularly in sectors like tourism, education, and creative industries. He called for greater cooperation to promote tourism, leveraging the region’s rich cultural diversity, and boosting local economies.The conference explored the vision of \"BIMSTEC Plus\" to extend partnerships beyond the region, creating wider economic corridors and addressing global challenges such as climate change, digital innovation, and economic resilience. \nSingapore Airlines said it would be operating two out of seven weekly flights between Singapore and Kathmandu with 787-10 Dreamliner during the festive season of Dashain and Tihar in October and November. Operating the Boeing 787-10 Dreamliner will allow the airline to expand its capacity for the route and cater to the higher customer demand during the festive season, the airline said in a statement. The 787-10 Dreamliner will be operated on Mondays and Thursdays. The aircraft is equipped with KrisWorld, in-flight Wi-Fi connectivity, fully flat beds and direct aisle access for all Business Class customers, and ergonomically-designed seats in Economy Class, offering all customers a more comfortable in-flight experience.Nepalis who are based overseas will be able to return home to spend Dashain and Tihar with their family and loved ones. The Boeing 787-10 Dreamliner is equipped with a total of 337 seats consisting of 36 Business Class seats and 301 Economy Class seats.  \nNcell, Nepal’s first private-sector GSM mobile service provider, celebrated nearly two decades of serving the country and its people with an important announcement: the launch of the Ncell Foundation to continue its Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) initiatives.“Over the past 19 years, Ncell has contributed over Rs2 billion to CSR activities in health, education, environment, and more, impacting over 13 million lives directly and indirectly. We now believe it is important to bring all of our good work under one umbrella, one purpose, and that is the Ncell Foundation,” said Jabbor Kayumov, chief executive officer and managing director of Ncell, during a special event organised to mark the 19th anniversary of the company.At the event, Ncell said the Foundation’s vision is to foster a more inclusive, connected and sustainable Nepal and contribute to the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) with 3 clear objectives: Supporting those who need it the most, bridging the digital divide and fostering a more healthy, sustainable and enriching Nepal.During the 2015 earthquake, Ncell contributed Rs100 million to the Prime Minister Disaster Relief Fund to support families affected by the devastating earthquake and another Rs1.6 billion worth of communication support was extended to help families stay connected.During the Covid-19 pandemic, Ncell contributed Rs100 million to support the government’s procurements of protective gear, PCR testing kits. And in Jajarkot after the earthquake last year, Ncell supported the Karnali provincial government with immediate support of Rs5 million for rescue, treatment, and relief of earthquake victims and also helped build classrooms in 10 government schools so children could go back to school. In 2014, Ncell contributed Rs200 million to the Prime Minister Disaster Relief Fund to help flood and landslide victims in different parts of the country.Ncell honoured Para-athlete Palesha Goverdhan, who recently made history at the Paris Paralympics 2024 by winning Nepal’s first-ever medal. A new initiative, ‘19 for 19,’ under the Ncell Foundation, was also announced. This project will provide financial support of Rs1 million each to 19 social projects across the country’s seven provinces.  \nThe licences of hundreds of health facilities of Bagmati Province have not been renewed for the past two years, as the provincial government has yet to enact its public health law.Health officials say even if the licences of most private health facilities have expired, those facilities are not illegal.They, however, concede that no agency in the country is monitoring activities of the private health facilities and their service quality due to the failure to renew the licences.“Other provinces across the country have already passed the provincial public health act to govern private hospitals up to 200-bed capacity and other health facilities,” said Dr Arjun Sapkota, chief of the Health Office, Kathmandu. “We hope that the Bagmati provincial government will introduce the provincial public health act soon, which will clear the way for licence renewal of the institutions fulfilling the due procedure.”There are over 1,000 private health facilities, including 52 private hospitals, in Kathmandu district alone. If all the health facilities in the province are counted, they will number in thousands, officials said.Operators of private health facilities, including the Association of Private Health Institutions of Nepal (APHIN), an umbrella organisation of private hospital operators, complained that they are deprived of banking services, importing health equipment and other facilities due to the apathy of the relevant agencies to renew the licences.“We recently held discussion with officials at the Health Office, Kathmandu and drew their attention to the non-renewal of licences,” said Dr Padam Bahadur Khadka, chairman of the Private Health institutions of Nepal. “Health facilites have been facing several problems including problems in importing equipment and banking facilities, among others.”Health officials say that monitoring of private health facilities operating in the districts of the Bagmati Province has been halted due to non-renewal of licences. They say that the condition of hospital equipment, manpower, hospital waste management, power back-up, operation theatres and emergency wards also need to be monitored but remain unattended for years.Studies show over 95 percent private hospitals have been operating out of rented residential buildings that have no proper patient safety measures. Nor are the facilities equipped to withstand disasters like earthquake and fire, and to handle patient flow caused by such disasters and disease outbreaks.Buildings that are currently being used by private hospitals were built many years ago and do not meet the basic criteria as they aren’t equipped with emergency entry and exit points, fire escapes, and waiting areas, among others. Majority of private hospitals also lack the required human resource and force staff to work overtime in the absence of enough personnel.Inspections carried out in the past show that most hospitals are also found to be lacking in hazardous waste management systems. The inspection team of the Ministry of Health and Population and local units found that most hospitals segregate hospital waste but the waste is then sent to private companies for management, where household waste is mixed up with the hospital waste. When hazardous waste produced from hospitals is left untreated, chances of infection spreading in communities are high.“Once the provincial government brings the provincial public health act, we will monitor the health facilities and renew licences,” Sapkota said. \nA 24-year-old student has died from the Nipah virus in the southern Indian state of Kerala, a local medical official said on Monday, and 151 people who came into contact with the victim are under observation to prevent the spread of the deadly virus.This is the second death caused by Nipah in Kerala since July. Nipah is classified as a priority pathogen by the World Health Organization (WHO) because of its potential to trigger an epidemic. There is no vaccine to prevent infection and no treatment to cure it.Parts of Kerala are among those most at risk globally for outbreaks of the virus, a Reuters investigation showed last year. Nipah, which comes from fruit bats and animals such as pigs, can cause a lethal, brain-swelling fever in humans.The student started showing fever symptoms on September 4 and died five days later, said R. Renuka, a district medical officer in the town of Malappuram, located in northern Kerala.The testing of a blood sample from the victim sent to the National Institute of Virology in Pune confirmed a Nipah infection on September 9, Renuka said.Five other people who have developed primary symptoms of a Nipah infection have had blood samples drawn and they were sent for tests, she said, without saying if they were primary contacts of the dead person.Nearly 151 people are being monitored for any symptoms after they were found to be on the primary contact list of the victim, who had come from Bengaluru, she said.This is the second death from a Nipah infection in Malappuram this year after a 14-year-old boy succumbed in July.Nipah has been linked to the deaths of dozens of people in Kerala since its first appearance in the state in 2018. \nLast week, a 24-year-old woman from Kathmandu was rushed to Tribhuvan University Teaching Hospital for treatment of a drug overdose. The woman had consumed multiple tablets with the intent to end her life, and it was her second attempt to kill herself.“We advised the right treatment to doctors attending the patient and also closely monitored her,” said Dr Apeksha Bista, a specialist in the Poison Information Center. “Along with treatment, several tests were carried out to assess the impact on her vital organs. The woman survived, and we referred her for psychiatric care.”This was among the 284 cases where the Poison Information Center either directly supervised or provided treatment advice in the last one year. The centre’s assistance has saved lives, not only in big city hospitals but also in far-flung health facilities across the country. However, the country’s only poison information centre, which started a year ago, is now on the verge of closure due to a shortage of funds. “This project, which was initiated with financial and technical support from Brown Emergency Medicine and logistic support from ASK Foundation, as a pilot initiative is nearing completion,” said Dr Dinesh Kafley, executive director at the Tribhuvan University Teaching Hospital. “ This is the only centre in the country that has been helping health workers in saving lives. Without resources, we are not in a position to continue the centre.”Studies show pesticide ingestion is the second major cause of suicide in Nepal, after hanging. Among those who consume pesticides, 95 percent ingest insecticides like aluminium phosphide, organophosphorus, and aluminium and zinc phosphide, among others. Despite the authorities banning dichlorvos and the removing the most toxic formulations of aluminium phosphide from sale years ago, suicide by pesticide ingestion has not declined.In the last fiscal year, 7,223 people in Nepal ended their lives, according to the Nepal Police data.“Just a few days ago, a doctor from Sankhusabha district sought help for the treatment of a 17-year-old girl who had ingested cypermethrin, an insecticide,” said Dr Rakesh Ghimire, coordinator of the Poison Information Centre. “We not only provided treatment guidance but followed up twice. The patient fully recovered and has been discharged from the hospital.”Experts say deaths due to pesticide poisoning can be reduced if poisoning cases are managed optimally. Health workers, including doctors, can call the Poison Information Centre hotline at 01 4502011 for treatment assistance.“Many healthworkers have already sought help,” said Ghimire. “Those who do not know or have not reached out could also call for expert advice. Doctors at the centre will provide the latest data and information on antidotes for treating poisoning.”  Doctors at the centre say besides intentional suicide attempts, cases of accidental drug overdose, ingestion of mosquito repellent, toilet cleaner, nutmeg (spice), toothpaste, and mushroom poisoning are frequently reported to them.According to doctors, most patients get cured if they are taken to the hospital on time, as physicians know the proper antidotes for poisons. They say that with detailed knowledge of toxicology, which overlaps biology, chemistry, pharmacology, and medicine, is not extensively taught in Nepal’s medical schools. Toxicology studies the adverse effects of chemicals on living organisms and their diagnosis and treatment.Experts also point out that seeking support helps patients’ relatives financially, as they do not have to rush mild cases to big hospitals and hire an ambulance.Dr. Ramu Kharel, an Assistant Professor of Emergency Medicine at Brown University in the USA, who led this collaboration for a poison information centre in Nepal reflected on the journey and called for future support. “This project began as a pilot to assess the feasibility of establishing the first institutional poison information center in Nepal, and we are proud to say that we have demonstrated that this is indeed feasible, ” said Kharel. “For continued sustainability of this programme, the Nepali government must take the lessons we have learned together and support this centre through funding.”He also said that along with finding ways to support service, concerned agencies also support Nepali doctors to get international opportunities to get trained in medical toxicology. Creating trained human resources in medical toxicology will provide the ultimate benefit for future sustainability of improved poisoning care in the country.  \nThe dengue menace shows no sign of going away as the deadly virus has now spread to almost all districts.Doctors warn that no one in Nepal is safe from the risk of infection, as the mosquito spreading the virus is present all over the country.What concerns them even more is that authorities have stopped preventive measures, including search and destroy drives, which are the only effective measures for cutting down the infection rate.The public’s fear of infection also appears to have diminished. “What can the public do when authorities take such risks lightly,” said Dr Baburam Marasini, a public health expert. “Any one of us could get infected by the virus at any time, and it does not make any difference to the government.”Dengue is a mosquito-borne viral disease transmitted by female Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes. The same vector also transmits chikungunya, yellow fever, and Zika, according to the World Health Organisation.So far this year, five people have died, and over 8,000 tested positive for the dengue virus, which has spread to 75 districts across the country. Officials admit that the real number of infections could be several times higher, as the government’s case reporting system is not very effective, and more than 80 percent of the cases are asymptomatic.Even symptomatic patients do not seek treatment unless they get severe. Many people infected with dengue show mild symptoms, which do not need any treatment or can be treated with paracetamol at home. Public health experts warn that dengue cases could escalate in the coming days as the peak season of the virus spread has just started.Experts emphasise the need for a massive awareness campaign for destroying the breeding ground of the dengue-spreading vector— and that the public must be made aware of the treatment.“Health authorities are not even implementing basic measures like launching an effective awareness drive to destroy the breeding sites of these vectors,” said Marasini. “The adult population is getting infected at workplaces, and children are being exposed at schools.”Experts say that the ongoing spread of dengue could have been prevented had the authorities taken the problem seriously and initiated a search-and-destroy drive. They say the disease will continue to spread unless lessons from previous outbreaks are effectively implemented.“Just counting the number of infected people will achieve nothing. Neither can we stop the spread of the virus nor determine the true extent of the outbreak,” said Dr Sher Bahadur Pun, chief of the Clinical Research Unit at Sukraraj Tropical and Infectious Disease Hospital. “Only those who suffer from severe dengue know how bad it is.”Dengue-transmitting mosquitoes breed in clean water and bite people in daylight. Uncovered water tanks and discarded objects such as plastic cups and bottles could be breeding grounds for dengue-carrying mosquitoes.According to doctors, mild to high fever, severe muscle pain, rashes, severe headache and pain in the eyes are some symptoms of dengue. Doctors advise that those with these symptoms seek immediate treatment. While there is no specific cure for the disease, early detection and access to proper medical care can lower fatalities.Nepal reported its first dengue case in a foreigner in 2004 in the Chitwan district. Since then, an increasing number of dengue infections and major outbreaks have been reported from many districts.Last year, at least 20 persons died and more than 52,000 were infected by the virus, which had spread to all 77 districts.In 2022, a total of 88 people died, and over 54,000 were infected by the virus across the country. In that period, hospitals in the Kathmandu Valley were overwhelmed with dengue patients, and pharmacies ran out of paracetamol, the most widely used medicine to treat fever.In 2019, the disease killed at least six people and more than 16,000 were hospitalised across the country. The virus had spread to 68 districts at the time.Though the post-monsoon period is considered the dengue epidemic season, the deadly disease has become endemic in Nepal, as outbreaks are reported every month, including in the winter months. \nDusit Princess Kathmandu is organising a five-day trout festival at its SOI restaurant. The dishes will be available for order from 12:30 pm to 10:00 pm every day till August 30. In celebration of Nepal’s rivers and lakes, which provide an ideal environment for high-quality trout, the Director of Culinary Food and Beverage Service, Chef Utpal Mondal, and his team at Dusit Princess Kathmandu have crafted a menu showcasing the flavours and versatility of locally sourced trout. “As the festive month of Shrawan ends, people focus on healthy and nutritious food. Trout, rich in omega-3 fatty acids, vitamins, and essential minerals, offers a heart-friendly option that checks all the boxes from a nutritional and culinary standpoint,” says Mondal.He adds that the goal of the culinary event is to offer their guests a rare opportunity to experience a wide variety of trout dishes they wouldn’t typically find at home.The event menu features twelve unique dishes, six of which are drawn from diverse culinary traditions across continents. Three dishes are inspired by oriental cuisine, while the remaining three highlight flavours from Nepal and India. The menu has been designed to include various dishes, from soups and starters to main courses, including Mexican, Italian, Continental, and Thai flavours.While discussing the event’s highlights, Mondal said, “The celebration presents a unique opportunity for guests to indulge in a diverse range of trout-based dishes, something they wouldn’t typically have the chance to experience elsewhere.” \nI can vividly remember my first encounter with baking when I was 10 years old. We had just moved to our new home and got a cable connection. The cable opened a world of possibilities, as it gave me access to various contents.This was back in the late 2000s when YouTube would take hours to load, taunting us with its buffering screen. I was particularly drawn to travel and lifestyle channels, mainly TLC, Fox Life, and Food Network, which kept me informed about different foods and cultures. I don’t know why, but I was always drawn to desserts. It was fascinating to see how these miraculous treats made people smile at the end of the meal.Growing up in Nepal, I noticed that baking wasn't very common. While some families did have ovens, they were mostly multifunctional ones used primarily for heating food.I also noticed that most of our desserts didn't require an oven, as they could be made on a stovetop. So, you can imagine my excitement when my mom decided to buy an oven during one of her festive shopping sprees.I could finally feel the joy these channels portrayed. (I blame food writer Nigella Lawson for getting me hooked on a domestic lifestyle.) Then, one day, after watching one of the cooking episodes on television, I finally mustered enough strength and decided to bake something. I distinctly remember wanting to make a chocolate cake for myself after watching one of Rachel Allen’s bake series. I watched all the ingredients used in that recipe and scurried across my pantry, only to realise I didn’t have half of the stuff she mentioned. I then decided to improvise the recipe (a big mistake). I randomly combined the ingredients that I had in a mixing bowl and chucked the batter into my oven, hoping for a magical cake to pop out an hour later.After I saw the result an hour later, I was mortified. The cake was stuck in the pan, refusing to come out, and it was as dense as fudge. I convinced myself that the taste was what mattered most, but when I served a slice to my brother, he made a face of utter disgust.That was the day I realised that baking soda was not the same as baking powder.After this incident, I researched baking and found out it was technical. This was a blessing in disguise for me, as I loved science, and I started to view baking as a science experiment. I then reflected and evaluated how to perfect one's baking skills.I analysed my errors and noted down all the steps I did every time I baked. Home baking is a passion for many. The idea of turning a few simple ingredients into a delicious masterpiece is as enchanting as it sounds.Yet, for many of us, this seemingly magical process can often turn into a series of unfortunate events, leading to crumbled dreams and deflated ambitions. Dense cakes, burnt crusts, rock-hard cookies and unrisen bread, if you are an amateur baker, then you have seen it all. But why do these mishaps happen so often? And most importantly how do we overcome them?From my experience, behind every successful bake lies a series of challenges and mishaps that test even the most dedicated bakers. Baking has its own set of rules that you need to follow to get that scrumptious treat every time. So, to transform a recipe into an actual dish that will impress your friends and family, I am sharing with you some of the tips and tricks I learned from my tumultuous journey as a home baker.First things first, we have to look into the prime appliance that we are working with. Commercial ovens are of two types: one that runs on gas and the other that runs on electricity. We have to look at the oven present at our home and consider its pros and cons. The main benefits of a gas oven are its size and temperature control. One can quickly change the temperature just by twisting the knob, and it preheats much more quickly than an electric one. However, they are known to have uneven temperatures at times and release more humidity, making it harder to properly crisp or brown food. This can result in burnt edges and cold or hot spots. An electric oven, on the other hand, provides more even and consistent temperatures and doesn’t release as much moisture in the air.This dry oven environment makes it easier to brown your items, making it great for baking bread. However, while the dry oven results in more even cooking, you also run the risk of drying out cakes and other baked goods.Also, many people forget to preheat the oven before baking, which is crucial for maintaining an even temperature throughout the baking process. When baking cakes and bread, I like to place a small tray of water at the bottom of the oven to provide moisture and prevent the baked goods from drying out.An oven thermometer can be a baker's best friend, providing a true reading and ensuring your creations bake evenly. I also like rotating the pan midway while baking, as it allows for an even distribution of heat.The next thing people mess up on is measuring and the specificity of ingredients in a recipe. Our moms made our food with their instinct; it is something that they learned along the way, but when you are baking, you cannot instinctively add or omit a few steps.I think that is why we initially had problems with baking. In a culture where cooking comes instinctually, baking challenges us, to be precise. A gram of more or less of any ingredient can drastically alter the outcome. Different methods of measuring flour can yield different results.Every component in baking serves a distinct purpose and function. Flour offers structure, sugar adds sweetness and moisture, eggs bind things together, and butter enhances taste and texture. However, not all ingredients are created equally. For example, using salted butter instead of unsalted might change the taste profile of your meal.Similarly, different flours have varying protein concentrations, which affect the texture of baked goods. The type of sugar used also makes a difference. Granulated sugar, brown sugar, powdered sugar, and speciality sugars like turbinado or muscovado each add unique flavours to a bake.Understanding these nuances and how they interact is critical for getting the intended outcomes. Accurate measurement tools and techniques are essential, but mastering them can be a steep learning curve. So, I would recommend investing in a kitchen scale that allows for more accurate measurements by weight rather than volume.Moving on, leavening agents such as baking soda, baking powder, and yeast are required to make baked goods rise. However, they can also cause confusion and errors. Baking soda needs an acidic component to activate, but baking powder has both an acid and a base, making it self-activating.Using the wrong type of flour or sugar, or using them in incorrect proportions, can result in flat, overly raised, or collapsed cakes. Yeast, being a living organism, presents its challenges.The water temperature must be just right—not too hot to kill the yeast, nor too cold to inhibit its activity. Proofing times and conditions also need to be carefully managed to achieve the perfect rise.Bakers should also be careful about the way they mix ingredients. The method of mixing ingredients can significantly impact the final product. Over-mixing can develop too much gluten in cakes and pastries, leading to tough textures.Under-mixing can leave pockets of unincorporated ingredients, resulting in uneven bakes. Techniques like folding, creaming, and whipping each serve specific purposes and must be executed with care.Finally, home bakers must understand the importance of timing and patience in baking. Even a minute or two can make the difference between perfectly baked cookies and burnt edges.Recipes often provide a range for baking times, but factors like oven hot spots, pan material, and altitude can affect these times. It’s crucial to keep a close eye on your bakes and rely on visual and tactile cues, such as a cake pulling away from the sides of the pan or a toothpick coming out clean, to determine doneness.Baking is also an exercise in patience, a virtue not everyone possesses. Doughs need time to rest and rise, flavours need time to meld, and baked goods need time to cool before they can be enjoyed.Impatience can lead to underbaked centres, crumbling slices, and a general sense of frustration. Cultivating patience is as important as mastering any technique in the baker’s repertoire.Home baking is a journey full of ups and downs, but it comes with great rewards. The obstacles encountered teach valuable lessons in patience, precision, and perseverance.The satisfaction of success, the freedom to create, and the therapeutic benefits make the endeavour meaningful. Whether baking for oneself, loved ones, or as an artistic outlet, the journey is as fulfilling as the result. Embrace the flour-dusted countertops, occasional setbacks, and the joys of home bakingFor a beginner-friendly recipe that involves mixing ingredients and delivers amazing results, try my recipe for fudgy, nutty brownies that I call ‘Bliss Brownies’.Bliss Brownies150g unsalted butter plus extra for the tin150g chopped dark chocolate200g caster sugar½ tsp baking powder2 eggs80g cocoa powder150g plain flour70g mixture of nuts (walnuts and almonds)60g blended papayaMix all the ingredients (except the dark chocolate and nuts) in a blender or a food processor and blitz till you get a smooth paste.Fold the chocolate and the nuts into the brownie batter, making sure that the pieces are evenly mixed in.Grease a loaf pan with soft butter and dust with cocoa powder. Pour the batter into the loaf pan.Bake in a preheated oven at 170c for 40 minutes and let it cool in the oven for an hour. Enjoy with a cup of coffee or, as I like it, a scoop of vanilla ice cream. \nIn a world where acceptance and safety often seem difficult to attain, many queer individuals also struggle to find a safe space to express themselves. They have to hide their true self and face relentless judgement when going to public places like cafes and restaurants.This is the reality for countless LGBTQIA+ individuals. The need for a safe space for this community is not just a desire but a necessity—a space where one can be themselves. This struggle for safety and acceptance can be traced to crucial historical moments, such as the Stonewall Riots of 1969 in New York City.The Stonewall Inn was more than a bar; it was a refuge for the queer community. When police raided the bar, the community fought back. This series of violent confrontations, which began in the early hours of June 28, 1969, between police and gay rights activists, marked the beginning of the modern LGBTQIA+ rights movement. The spirit of Stonewall, the fight for dignity and the right to exist openly lives on in places like Inclusive Galaxy Restaurant in Kathmandu. Inclusive Galaxy beyond a restaurant is an ‘oasis’ for the queer community and beyond.Founded by Bishwaraj Adhikari, Mr Gay Handsome Nepal 2013, a human rights defender, the restaurant proves the power of safe spaces. It’s a place where the community can unite, free from the prejudice and hostility that often permeate their everyday lives.After years of working in the human rights sector, Adhikari and his partner developed the idea for Inclusive Galaxy. What began as a small cafe gradually evolved into a full-fledged restaurant, driven by the growing demand and support from the community.“In developed countries with strong LGBTQIA+ movements, you can find community areas like gay villages. These are created as safe spaces for people whose families and communities have excluded them. They also support new business ideas and pink tourism. I hope to see pink tourism develop in Nepal someday,” says Adhikari. His vision for Inclusive Galaxy goes beyond just being a restaurant. He aims to promote financial independence and empowerment within the queer community.Since its inception in February 2019, Inclusive Galaxy has become a key spot for many in Lazimpat, a relatively queer-friendly area in Kathmandu. The location is essential because the first LGBTQIA+ movement in Nepal started in 2001 through the Blue Diamond Society.Inclusive Galaxy, true to its name, welcomes everyone—queer and non-queer alike—to share a comfortable space. His vision was clear: to create a space where people of all genders and sexual identities could come together without fear of exclusion.“I didn’t want to make it exclusively for queer people because that would be excluding ourselves from society. Different groups need to live together and understand each other,” Adhikari explains.In the early days, the cafe attracted both queer and non-queer customers. However, when some of the residents learned about Adhikari’s identity and the nature of the clientele, there was a brief period of hesitation. “At first, I didn’t understand what was happening, but then I realised my identity was an issue for a few people. I believe people should be judged by others by their character, not by their gender or sexuality. Over time, as residents saw that we operated like any other cafe, they became more comfortable,” Adhikari reflects.Adhikari started Inclusive Galaxy to give queer individuals a place to be proud of themselves, counteracting the self-doubt and insecurity that hiding one’s identity can cause. This turned the cafe very quickly into a community hub. The journey was not without challenges, though. It was difficult to hire staff and cooks from the LGBTQIA+ community, and soon after the restaurant opened, the COVID pandemic made things even harder.Despite these difficulties, the doors of Inclusive Galaxy remained open. During the pandemic, many queer individuals, who were abandoned by their families or afraid to return home, found comfort at Inclusive Galaxy.Since many couldn’t afford to pay for meals, the restaurant provided free food from its resources. As the number of people needing meals grew to 20-30 daily, Adhikari started raising funds within the community.“During my time as an activist, many people came here not only for food but also to see an organisation where the queer community supports one another,” Adhikari says.“The time during COVID was difficult, but it brought me closer to the community.”Four years after its inception, the restaurant has garnered a loyal following. Sarosy Neupane, Miss Pink Nepal 2024 first runner-up, describes Inclusive Galaxy as her second home. She moved to Kathmandu to study in 2022. Being distant from her family, she started visiting Galaxy for meals that reminded her of home-cooked food. Over time, she grew attached to the café because of its welcoming atmosphere.“It’s heartwarming to see people from our community and different walks of life here. The founders even invite us to festivals like ‘Dahi Chiura Khane din,’” she shares.Neupane visits the cafe regularly and sometimes stays until 3 am, engrossed in conversations. “I hope more spaces like this can open in the future. If, unfortunately, this place were to close someday, I don’t think we’d have any other place to turn to,” she adds.Muna Chhetri, a trans woman who has been a loyal customer for three years, shares, “This is my safe space where I can truly be myself. I always feel judged in other restaurants, but that fear doesn’t exist here. It’s where even those who aren’t accepted at home can feel accepted.”Sahara Khadka Chhetri, owner of Pink Tiffany, Kathmandu’s first openly LGBTIQIA+ friendly restaurant and bar, frequently visits after managing the bar, appreciating the convenience of not cooking at home.She notes very few places like this cater to our community, and some even had to close during COVID. “As an entrepreneur, I know that sustaining these spaces is a challenge. But as more spaces like these open, they will make the way for a more inclusive and compassionate society.”The welcoming atmosphere at Inclusive Galaxy has also had a surprising effect on non-queer patrons. Samriddha Jung Rana, a twenty-year-old neighbour who identifies as straight, often visits the café and appreciates the importance of such spaces.“Previously, I didn’t know much about the queer community and didn’t care much. But now, coming into this café, I’ve been interested in their rights and issues. I’ve realised that we’re not so different after all. We are all human,” he remarks.The ventures like Inclusive Galaxy and Pink Tiffany have inspired hope for collaborative businesses between queer and non-queer groups. The recent initiative by the Nepal Tourism Board promoting Pink Tourism in April 2024 is a positive step. Still, Adhikari believes that more support is needed from the government and the private sector.Despite the progress, challenges remain. However, Adhikari remains optimistic about the future. He is working on plans to develop the restaurant into a homestay program in the future.“Like how different planets, asteroids, and stars make up a beautiful galaxy, people from all walks of life and identities make a beautiful society. I am happy that we are assimilating together in this space. We are not so different; we are all different and similar simultaneously,” he says. \nAditya Mishra is a Nepali chef and entrepreneur based in New York. Passionate about elevating Nepali cuisine globally, Mishra sharpened his culinary skills while staging at various Michelin-starred restaurants in the city during his time at culinary school. A recipient of the James Beard Foundation National Scholars Scholarship in 2023, Mishra’s early experiences inspired him to establish his own supper club, ‘The Sewing Tin’, alongside co-founder Akhil Upad.In an interview with Post’s Aarati Ray, Mishra discusses his restaurant in New York, serving Nepali cuisines there and the recipe for his signature dish.How did your cooking journey start in New York?At 14, I told my parents I wanted to be a chef, but they preferred I pursue a stable career like engineering, as many Nepali families do. So, I left for Louisiana in 2019 to study engineering.But, cooking never left my heart so, after a year, I left engineering college and moved to New York City. It’s been three and a half years and my parents only learned about it later. When my mom visited me in NYC and saw my dedication to cooking, she saw my passion and supported my decision.What sparked your interest in cooking from a young age?As a child, I was drawn to cooking shows on TLC. The glamour of cooking, eating, travelling and the prosperity of famous chefs was fascinating.Around age 16, I discovered Chef Anthony Bourdain’s groundbreaking book, ‘Kitchen Confidential’, which shed light on the reality of the culinary industry. I learned how he became a cultural icon in NYC, reshaping perceptions of chefs.I was also fascinated by chefs like Marco Pierre White, who was a mentor to Gordon Ramsay. Their stories of achieving fame while maintaining discipline intrigued me. But, as I grew older and entered the culinary world, I realised it was far from glamorous—it involved dedication and I am glad I persevered.How did the idea for The Sewing Tin originate?The concept of ‘The Sewing Tin’ came when I realised the stark contrast between the romanticised view of kitchen work and its harsh reality. Witnessing the struggles of many kitchen staff—economic hardships, immigration challenges and language barriers—I had to rediscover my love for cooking.During my internship at ‘Junoon’ restaurant, I met my co-founder, Akhil Upad, who shared my culinary enthusiasm despite his preparations for medical college. Together, we wanted to create a dining experience that was more personal and communal, offering fine dining with a sense of community.We wanted our food to tell stories, so we named our restaurant ‘The Sewing Tin’ inspired by the immigrant experience in NYC. When immigrants opened cookie boxes as kids, they often found sewing supplies instead of food.‘The Sewing Tin’ is like opening a cookie box and finding sewing supplies—something uniquely desi, or South Asian. How do you promote Nepali cuisine in New York City through The Sewing Tin?My partner is from Atlanta with Indian roots, while I come from Nepal, so our menu celebrates and reflects both cultures and heritage.We represent our respective cultures authentically. For example, we have a dish inspired by Newari cuisine called kachaila, similar to French Tartar. We present it as Tartar to make it accessible to our customers but infuse it with Nepali flavours, telling stories about its origins and giving diners a taste of my homeland.What do you think of the prospects of Nepali cuisine abroad?I’m on a mission to share Nepali food worldwide. I have served up dishes like chatamari and lamb sekuwa in my restaurant. But I’m still learning and want to explore more of Nepal’s cuisines. My big dream? To make Nepali cuisine reach more places because it’s got something special that can wow taste buds everywhere.How do you see the changes in restaurants in Nepal?The restaurant industry has deep roots in community and bringing people together, dating back centuries. While this core idea remains, modern restaurants have evolved, making changes to adapt to the times.Yet, in Nepal, despite the growing number of restaurants, many lack uniqueness and storytelling, focusing more on making money than fostering a sense of community.I’ve noticed a troubling trend of rising prices, especially for beloved dishes like momos, which makes people question if they're getting value for their money. It seems like profits are taking precedence over creating genuine, authentic culinary experiences.The industry is starting to lose the creativity and passion that once made it special. It might be time for chefs to shake things up, challenge the norm and bring fresh ideas to the table, revitalising the culinary scene with renewed energy and creativity.What challenges have you faced in New York as an outsider?Living in a bustling city like New York as an outsider has its challenges. But, this city is also full of opportunities for those who are passionate. If you stay true to your culture and want to share your story, opportunities are waiting for you.Even though it can be daunting because of the tough competition, the city appreciates determination and expertise. When I started my journey here, all I wanted to do was cook, eat and share the story of Nepal and its diverse cultures. Instead of focusing on the difficulties, I embraced the chance to follow my passion.What do you think about the criticism of blending Nepali food with modern culinary styles?Chefs care about their food—it’s like they’re sharing a story. They’ve put in a lot of effort to become skilled, so let them be creative. It’s okay to give helpful advice but don’t be mean just to criticise. Chefs shouldn’t also just copy what’s popular, they should cook what they truly love. That’s what makes food special and meaningful.Mishra’s signature dish:Confit Duck Chatamari A traditional Nepali delicacy with French influence.Ingredients:Duck (Legs and breast)Rice (soaked overnight)MayonnaiseWhole spices (cloves, cinnamon, cardamom, bay leaf)Red onionGarlicGingerMula ko achar (Fermented radish)ScallionsLemon juiceNepali pepperVinegarSaltSugarProcedure:For the Duck:Season duck with salt and pepper.Cook in a covered pan with whole spices, garlic, and ginger at low heat for 2 hours on a stove (270 degrees in the oven)Increase heat to crisp up the skin (approximately 15 minutes).Shred the duck meat.Confit Garlic Aioli:Mash cooked garlic and ginger and mix with mayonnaise, lemon juice, Nepali pepper and fermented radishes.Pickled Onions:Slice onions and cook in a mixture of vinegar, water, salt, sugar, and whole spices until softened (about 10 minutes).For the chatamari:Blend soaked rice to make a batter, let it ferment for 6 hours, and adjust consistency with water.Assembling:Cook chatamari batter in duck fat for 4 minutes.Top with shredded duck, aioli, pickled onions and scallions.Serve \nCeleus Baral exudes a serene aura when you meet her, and when she tells you she bakes, it makes sense. Even during a brief encounter, you can tell she has the patience needed to be a baker.“You can eyeball cooking, but baking is chemistry. You have to be meticulous. You cannot rush it, or it does not turn out as expected,” says the 21-year-old environment science student. She also runs the online baking shop Bakeleus. Recently, she has also started selling her baked goods beyond her online shop, with her first stall appearing at The Yellow House’s Night Market. Bakeleus’s menu lists a variety of offerings, including jams, granola, tarts, cakes, cookies, cupcakes and brownies. Baral began baking in 2020, during the lockdown, and launched her online shop last year.She grows much of the produce she incorporates into her baking, and believes we should all understand the origins of our food. “This connection fosters gratitude and a deeper appreciation for nature,” she says. Her background in environmental science, coupled with her affinity for the natural world, imbues her creations with a unique artistic sensibility. Each item she bakes is a testament to her creativity and experimentation, as she believes consistent practice is the key to mastery.Despite the demands of being a full-time student, Baral strives to accommodate orders, typically requiring a minimum of 72 hours' notice for delivery. She is a passionate and discerning individual, evident in the love she infuses into her baking. Additionally, Baral advocates for a zero-waste policy at home, ensuring that every scrap of food and all household items are recycled.Three easy to bake recipes you can try at homeMini carrot cakes Ingredients:38 g milk or yoghurt35 g all-purpose flour1/4 tea spoon ground cinnamon1/8 tea spoon ground gingerA pinch of cardamom1 tea spoon baking powder½ tea spoon fine sea salt2 large eggs, at room temperature27 g granulated sugar13 g brown sugar (or 39 g of regular granulated sugar)1 tea spoon vanilla extract27 g extra virgin olive oil33 g carrots, peeled and shreddedChopped walnutsCandied lemon or orange slices (optional for garnish)Cream cheese frosting56.5 g unsalted butter, softened113.5 g cream cheese, softened1/2 teaspoon vanilla extractA pinch of salt250 g powdered sugarDirections:For the cake:Preheat the oven to 195°C.

Yet, pockets of the past remain—small, peaceful neighbourhoods where houses are still made of wood, paths are made of stone tiles, and the stillness of a world that wants to stay intact and immobile. These places are known for tourism, culture, and the restoration of community pride. One such stop is the quiet village of Khokana in southern Lalitpur.Khokana is comparatively close to the mainland urban Lalitpur; from the ring road junction of Bagdole, it takes only a 10-minute drive to reach there. From the airport, you can take a cab directly to Khokana, which will take around half an hour. Get your cameras and hiking boots ready; the area is filled with historical artefacts and hiking trails.However, it is vastly different from the city. It is much nearer to the hills, where stone-paved paths, which could easily be goat trails, are rare in today’s Kathmandu.One such goat trail leads to Sikali temple, a major attraction of the area and accessible only on foot. The pavements are lined with big and small temples on each side, along with ponds that serve as clean water sources and a location for religious rituals. The houses are made of bricks and wood. The concrete invasion, although present, is minimal. Scattered every few hundred metres are small mustard oil mills, co-operative businesses of the locals of Khokana that have existed since medieval times.A site well-recognised for its historical significance, Khokana was even proposed to be made a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1996. Sikali TempleAround an hour’s walk from the historic town, Sikali Temple can be reached, which is also the location for its famed Sikali Jatra.While it can be reached through any public vehicle, a more holistic and adventurous route is to follow the goat trails on the outskirts of Khokana. This route, albeit long, allows for great hiking opportunities, scenic views of the hills surrounding the Kathmandu Valley, and a close-up view of the mediaeval but well-maintained architecture of the local houses.Even if you lose the way, which is very possible, the locals are very welcoming and more than willing to guide you. The main temple itself is three stories tall, and built in the Pagoda style, a common style in many temples in the valley.It is surrounded by a lush grass field which plays the stage to the Sikali Jatra held every year. The temple, like many religious spots around Khokana, is dedicated to the local deity Shree Rudrayani.The Sikali Jatra, a five-day festival that serves as an alternative to Dashain for the Khokana locals, is filled with chariot dances, battle enactments, and storytelling celebrations in the worship of Goddess Rudrayani.Starting from Ghatasthapana in mid to late September, the Jatra is vibrant and an essential experience for every visitor. Historical Khokana townKhokana’s historical town is located around 5 minutes walking distance from the local bus park. The town complex, paved with hand-made stone tiles, is graced with the Indrayanee temple but also has many red-bricked houses built in the local Newari architecture, some of them centuries old.One such house is the ‘Khokana Museum’. Although closed, it is widely popular for being the first house to be lit with electricity in Nepal, as Chandra Shamsher did in 1911.The stand-holder of the first light bulb can still be seen, serving as a historical monument for everyone to see.Similarly, the town complex is also filled with Guthi houses, small ponds, and even the local Ward office. While the Ward office provides a wealth of information for visitors interested in the area’s history, the Guthi halls symbolise the strong community support culture of the locals.The ponds, a notable one present right opposite the Indrayanee temple, have stone taps and remind us of primitive ways of obtaining clean water—a practice many locals are still engaged in.Yet, these ponds are also religious locations, especially used in rituals in the Sikali Jatra.Finally, a stroll through the complex allows visitors to explore old houses and historical artefacts in the serene quietness of Khokana, while the small outlets and Choila places nearby allow you to enjoy the spicy duck or chicken delicacies at the same time.Overall, the historical complex is enough to transport visitors back to a glimpse of the medieval past of the Kathmandu Valley. Mustard oil millsThe most well-known feature of Khokana is its mustard oil mills, which have been operational for hundreds of years and have been using the same methods of preparation since their inception.These mills, scattered throughout Khokana, are often community-owned, and even the ones owned by certain individuals have almost exclusively employed locals.Despite the advent of modern machinery, there is still substantial demand for their products due to the assured guarantee.When I visited one such mill, the local staff informed me that the furnace and oil presser used by them were 300 years old, given by the Patan royalty even before the Shahs became king.In addition to buying pure, organically created mustard oil and pellets, visiting these oil mills offers many educational benefits for international and local tourists alike.Khokana offers visitors a unique glimpse into a preserved bubble of the past through its tranquillity, preservation of ancient lifestyle and cultural elements, and remarkable self-sustenance.  \n“How much oxygen do you have for the summit?”I think this is the kind of question a film producer would ask. But when you're on the mountain, the answer is never clear.I have worked for a long time in the film industry and different art areas, especially photography and engraving.Working in various fields and drawing inspiration from them has become a new normal for me. I have made this approach my way of life without even realising it.I took responsibility for producing the last movie I worked on and shot the behind-the-scenes footage for a documentary. By doing so, I witnessed the entire shooting process and the journey of a movie.In the snowy highlands of Turkey, we had to endure the consequences of the changing climate to shoot ‘About Dry Grasses’, directed by Nuri Bilge Ceylan. The highlands used to be snowy in January, but by the time we got there in the same month, there was no snow. Nature was changing. It was responding to what was happening—to what humanity had done to it. In the end, it snowed, and we shot the intense snow scenes we wanted. But since most of our days were sunny, unlike what the director wanted, we had to shoot in the sunset and sunrise hours. As crew members, we spent many days waiting for the sun to set.Production requires creating opportunities, finding solutions, and being creative for a work of art to come true. For this, patience, endurance, calmness, and timing are necessary. On the other hand, nature wanted us to listen to it and wait for the right time.During that time, I witnessed many of nature's lessons. For example, I experienced extreme cold for the first time. We endured temperatures ranging from -33 degrees to +55 degrees. By listening to nature, surrendering to its forces, and working within its limits, we managed to persevere.No matter how much you prepare or plan during the pre-production phase, if you are working in nature, remember that nature will always have the final say.The film was completed, released, and connected with audiences. Its success at Cannes 2023 was followed by my trip to the North Pole for my project. I returned with a mix of wonderful developments, joys, and challenges. During this process, I experienced life and death, happiness and sadness, losses and awards.I realised the value of being able to breathe comfortably a few days after my father's chemotherapy ended. Just a few days earlier, he had said, \"Well done, my daughter. I'm glad you went!\" All the anxiety and hard work, filled with fears at the beginning, were finally behind me.Before going to Everest, when I was on the verge of giving up, defeated by my fears, I remembered my father's words. Everest reminded me of what he said while struggling to breathe, adding a turning point to my life.What does it mean to say ‘life’s turning point?’ How many turning points can there be in life?Who am I, and what am I doing in this world? How well do I know my own limits? Can I find answers to these big questions? These thoughts sparked my dream of journeying to Everest. Now, after returning, I can say that it turned my life around.“How much oxygen do you need for the summit?” sounds more like “How much do you need to hold on to life?” How many reasons do you find that give meaning to your life, keep you alive, and allow you to breathe? How much can you endure in the face of obstacles, and can you keep believing that a solution will eventually come your way?Can these questions be separated from the idea of measuring and assessing something, from learning its quantity and financial value? Can everything be known with certainty? Should the journey be fully understood in advance, with all its promises laid out? Should it be viewed like a purchase with a price tag, asking, “Is this journey worth this much?”I had never trekked before and had no climbing experience. I had lived at sea level my entire life and had never been to a high altitude.However, this journey was not only about the physical climb but also an inner discovery. After losing my father to lung cancer, his breathing difficulties taught me the fragility of breath, life, and existence. I also mentally prepared myself for the physical challenges I might face. Despite all my concerns, could this journey help me understand the cycle of life and the resilience of the soul?So, how could I make this trek possible? How could I land in Nepal? Despite all the economic difficulties and the many things I felt needed organising, I did my best and believed in it.Since I was embarking on this journey, I felt I should share about my travels and inspire others.Starting with photography, cinema, and engraving, which are already integral parts of my life, I dreamed of documenting and sharing the inspiring aspects of this journey.After months of correspondence and dreaming, it all came true. Finally, I embarked on the journey with the goal of creating photographs, engravings, and documentaries. I learned a great deal from my travels in Nepal, from the people I met, and from every moments I witnessed. I felt incredibly fortunate to have been able to honour my father’s memory with the peace and serenity I experienced in the Himalayas.During my 15-day journey to Everest Base Camp, I encountered nature’s masterpieces at every turn. As concerns like “How will I endure?” and “How will I finish?” started to weigh on me, the mountains suddenly parted with the clouds and gazed down at me.It was amazing to witness the appearance of ‘Gods’ that I had never seen before, in such immense size and in such a close, awe-inspiring manner beside me during that silent walk.As someone who came from one of the most crowded cities in the world, Istanbul, while I struggled with my daily questions and uncertainties, trying to control everything, they stood there calmly, as if answering me.They were just there—before and after.My guide, Lakhpa Sherpa, always reminded me not to worry about how high we were, how long it would take to reach our accommodation, or what the weather would be like. He encouraged me to live in the moment, and he was right.He advised me to focus on my breathing, not to get thirsty, to eat enough, and to appreciate the extraordinary beauty of the journey. In the mountains, plans dissolve and each moment is embraced as it comes.All the good wishes, prayers, and everything encountered along the way were for the journey itself. The mountain was full of life, secrets, and everything I had wondered about.This 15-day journey to Everest Base Camp was a solo adventure, yet I wouldn't have been able to complete it without my guide, Lhakpa, and my porter. Additionally, I was fortunate enough to experience the hospitality, generosity, and honesty at Trekkers Paradise, which organised the entire journey and provided guidance.I witnessed how dedication and sincerity are crucial in completing a journey safely and healthily. Ghanshyam Sharma, from Trekkers Paradise and Sauraj Jhingan, a climber who summited the Everest in 2018, shared their experiences with me during the journey.They experienced the 2015 earthquake while they were at the Everest Base Camp.As a filmmaker, their role as actors, and attention to detail played a significant role in bringing my dream photography and documentary project to life.The sponsors of my journey were Turkish Airlines, The North Face, Apple, Canon, and Stanley. My supporters include Oscar International College and Nepal Film Campus. Throughout the journey, I shared many experiences, memories, and countless photos and images with my students.On my way back home after 21 days, I celebrated my birthday on the plane. From the right window, the Himalayas bid me farewell. I felt like I had opened a new chapter in my life, and I was certain that I would return.I had made many friends and memories in Nepal.For now, I will be working on a documentary and preparing for a photography and engraving exhibition titled ‘My Soul Beyond the Mountain’.To the Himalayas: This summer was spent with you, but we will meet again soon. \nWe spent five days in Sri Lanka two weeks ago, driving up and down the island, covering almost 70 percent of its territory. Our tour spanned over 1,000 kilometres, including hills, beach spots, and heritage and religious sites.Our first stop in Sri Lanka was Colombo’s Bandaranaike International Airport. We were greeted by a warm and humid breeze when we exited the airport. The host briefed us (a group of journalists) that heavy rainfall has affected areas across Sri Lanka since mid-May 2024. Rain and storms intensified on June 1, with the most significant effects in the south and west of the country. We were lucky to have no rain in the forecast.On the first night, we checked into the lavish Jetwing Lake resort, an opulent sanctuary amidst the lush landscape. The resort’s expansive grounds were a retreat, offering a glimpse of Sri Lanka's natural beauty. We feasted on delicious cuisine, every bite exploding with flavour, introducing us to the island’s famed culinary delights. On June 7, early morning, the sun shone brightly, previewing the promise of an incredible journey ahead. We set off early the following day, eager to explore the mysteries of this enchanting island. As we ventured further into the heart of Sri Lanka, the landscape revealed its majestic nature. We were astounded by seeing Pidurangala Rock, a 200-metre-high granite colossus just a kilometre north of Sigiriya. The short hike to Pidurangala Rock offered breathtaking views of Sigiriya and beyond. We climbed the steep steps and soon were rewarded with a breathtaking panoramic view of the surrounding landscape. It took us 30 minutes to climb. The sight took our breaths away and left us humbled in the presence of such grandeur. From the top are glorious vistas of the surrounding landscape and an incredible view of the majestic Sigiriya Rock. From there, Sigiriya Lion’s Rock is visible, standing alone. This was the place where demon king Ravana had his palace in the Treta Yuga. Believed to have been built 50 centuries ago, the palace is said to have had a unique lift for Ravana and his visitors. Ravana imprisoned Sita in one of the caves at the bottom of this humongous boulder. Sigiriya is a fifth-century fortress in Sri Lanka carved out of an inselberg, a hill of hard volcanic rock that soared high above the surrounding jungle. We spent two hours atop the rock, mainly taking photographs. We descended from Pidurangala Rock, filled with awe and a sense of accomplishment.The journey ahead seemed even more enticing as we ventured along the winding roads, heading towards our next destination.Cash-strapped Sri Lanka plunged into its worst financial crisis in more than seven decades in 2022, with a severe dollar shortage sending inflation soaring to a high of 70 percent, its currency to record lows, and its economy contracting 7.3 percent.Thanks to the growing number of tourists, Sri Lanka is now bouncing back.In Jetwing Lake, we met Kasun Pradeep Somasiri, a receptionist. He briefed us that the resort is now 50 percent occupied. “That’s a better figure now as we are recovering.”The travel and tourism sector is a significant income generator for Sri Lanka. However, the economic crisis, the Ukraine–Russia war, and China’s zero-Covid policy have jeopardised the industry.Tourism accounted for more than 12 percent of the country’s GDP in 2019 and was the third-largest source of foreign exchange reserves, behind worker remittances and the apparel industry.Sri Lanka was poised to be one of the world’s best holiday destinations due to its rich culture, wealth of natural resources, and diversity of accessible experiences.However, tourism-dependent Sri Lanka suffered its first major setback with the Easter bombings 2019. This led to the collapse of inbound tourism flows as international arrivals declined by 18 percent year-on-year, and tourist expenditure fell by 17.7 percent that year. This was immediately followed by two years of pandemic restrictions. Inbound visitors fell to just 116,600 in 2021.An acute balance of payments crisis forced Sri Lanka to preemptively default on foreign debt of over $50 billion in April 2022, triggering a crippling economic contraction with spiralling inflation.“Tourism is gaining momentum,” says Somasiri. “The British and Chinese have started to return to Sri Lanka.”January-August is the peak season for foreigners. “From December to April, local people travel for holiday purposes,” says Somasiri. Before we started the tour to other religious sites, our tour guide, Sampath Mayadunne, told us, “Don't take selfies with your back to Buddha.” Turning your back on a Buddha statue and some other religious sites to take photos and videos is a strict no-no.The most common sight across Sri Lanka is the tank cascades system, an ancient irrigation infrastructure. The system is a network of small tanks draining to large reservoirs that store rainwater and surface runoff for later use.“These infrastructures were built by its ancient kings over 2,000 years ago to solve the water scarcity in the country’s dry zone,” says Mayadunne.On day two, we travelled to Ranweli Spice Garden in Matale. This garden is famous for its rare spices and herbs. A tour of the gardens will show you the cultivation, harvesting, cleaning, and packaging process, as well as the health benefits and uses of the herbs.On the way, we saw a colourful Muthumariamman Hindu temple, boasting hundreds of detailed sculptures in a rich mosaic of colour.In Kandy, we visited the Temple of the Tooth Relic (Sri Dalada Maligawa), one of the most sacred places of worship in the Buddhist world. It was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1988.The temple sustained damage from bombings by Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna in 1989 and by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam in 1998. However, it was fully restored each time.We then headed to Jetwing St Andrew’s, a luxurious 5-star property in Sri Lanka’s hill country of Nuwara Eliya, situated at 1,900 metres above sea level. During our stay in Kandy, we immersed ourselves in the city's charm and the serenity of the countryside. On the third day, early morning, we travelled to Nuwara Eliya, the area famous for tea estates that give many Nepalis the feeling that they have come to Kanyam, Ilam, in eastern Nepal.We visited a tea factory called Damro Labookellie Tea Centre, the oldest tea centre in Sri Lanka. Due to its cold climate, it is the most important area for tea production in Sri Lanka.In this tea factory, they make white and black tea, while the green tea is processed in another tea factory and then sent to Damro.After the tea factory tour and the tea tasting, we headed to Galle, our next resting point.We encountered narrow, winding, and maze-like streets and alleys in Nuwara Eliya, known as ‘Little England’. The town has preserved almost all its British-era buildings and is calm and beautiful. On our way to Galle, at the roadside, our tour guide stopped us at the famed Sita temple, which has Hanuman's footprints and is the place where Sita, wife of Lord Rama, was held captive by the demon king Ravana after he abducted her from India.We were at Sita Eliya, a temple named Sri Seethai Amman.When we reached the Hindu temple, rich in vibrant colours and architectural elements, it was full of devotees. The water stream adjoining the temple is believed to be where Sita bathed. Large footprints are found on the stones in the stream, and there is a saying that those belong to Hanuman, who came spying to find Sita’s whereabouts.In Ella, Ravana’s waterfalls are significant in the Rama-Ravana story. The cascade charms visitors from all over the globe. The waterfall is easily accessible and is known to have hidden caves at the top, which are believed to have been used as Ravana's residence.The 25-metre-tall waterfall is a beautiful cascade that provides the perfect backdrop for a photo to remember your Ramayana trail adventures in Sri Lanka. A short pilgrimage tour ended there, and it was now time for an adventure. Though it was not part of our itinerary, our guide decided to tour us on a train ride.Though short, only six kilometres from Ella to Demodera, it was thrilling. Everyone screamed in unison like kids on a fair ride to hear the echoes in the dark every time we passed through the tunnels. The sound of the train is subtly different inside a tunnel. For the first-timer, the darkness and shouts inside the tunnels when the train passes would be scary, like a horror movie.The train we boarded wasn’t crowded, but people had already filled the doorway, ready for the scenic journey.With the shrill sound of a whistle, the train slowly pulled away from the platform at Ella, passing houses, coconut trees and green fields.As the train progressed, tourists and locals were leaning out the windows and crowding to hang out the doors. I joined the crowd and hung out on a train. A short excitement ended there.After lunch, we headed to Galle and reached Jetwing Lighthouse. As soon as our group entered the hotel, they shouted with excitement.The hotel is on a rocky outcrop three miles west of Galle. Waves crash over giant boulders in front of it and produce howling winds.We were at Galle’s 17th-century fort five minutes from the hotel on day four. In the Bay of Galle on the southwest coast of Sri Lanka, Galle Fort was built first in 1588 by the Portuguese and lavishly rebuilt by the Dutch during the 17th century. It is a historical, archaeological and architectural heritage monument that maintains a perfect appearance even after more than 436 years.We then reached Hikkaduwa Beach, a popular beach destination on the southern coast of Sri Lanka. On the way, we saw a 30-metre-high Big Buddha Statue. It is a replica of the 6th-century Buddhas of Bamiyan destroyed by the Taliban in Afghanistan. It was created using the earliest known sketches of the statue. It was built in remembrance of the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami victims.We then travelled through the 222-kilometre-long Southern Expressway, Sri Lanka's first expressway linking the capital, Colombo, with Galle, Matara, and Hambantota, significant cities south of the island.On day five, we reached Colombo, the capital of Sri Lanka. Jetwing Colombo Seven hosted us in the bustling capital. We took a city tour early morning and visited Bally's Casino at night.On day six, we returned to Kathmandu early in the morning on a Sri Lankan Airlines flight, the airline that organised the trip in coordination with Jetwing Hotels Limited, a Sri Lankan hotel chain.National flag carrier Nepal Airlines, in its previous avatar as Royal Nepal Airlines, used to operate direct flights to Colombo during the 1980s. However, the carrier suspended operations following an armed movement by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) in Sri Lanka. There had been no direct air links between the two countries for decades.In 2016, Himalaya Airlines started a chartered flight that lasted a few months due to low traffic movement between the two countries. Sri Lankan Airlines started operating direct flights to Kathmandu in August 2021.“The main objective of this media tour is to increase tourism in both countries for mutual benefit. We want to draw Nepalis for pilgrims and leisure activities,” says Nilina Pathirana, Country Manager at Srilankan Airlines in Nepal.“We have understood that Nepali travellers tend to travel to Bangkok, Vietnam, Malaysia, Dubai, and Maldives. Nepalis have quite minimal knowledge about Sri Lanka and the religious connection between Lanka and Nepal. We want to promote Nepal and Sri Lanka jointly. This will be a win-win business,” added Pathirana.The airline said it currently carries 60 percent of the passengers from Nepal to Sri Lanka and beyond destinations like Tokyo, Sydney, Melbourne, and other Middle Eastern destinations. The return airfare for a 3.5-hour-long flight starts at Rs74,000. “We have a four-night, five-day package that begins from Rs80,000, depending on the properties and extended itineraries,” says Pathirana.Nepalis must submit certain required documents for visa processing, like their passport copy and bank statement. Due to this government-to-government policy, only Nepalis must obtain a prior visa. Otherwise, Sri Lankans are required to have a visa upon arrival.“The other best thing is that Sri Lankan Airlines can be involved with the visa process or facilitate the Nepalis tourists. Our main intention is to have a sustainable market in Kathmandu and make it a daily flight,” says Pathirana. \nMundhum Trek in Koshi province in the eastern part of Nepal is a new cultural walking trail. It passes through several indigenous ethnic villages and landscapes in Khotang and Bhojpur districts. This trail goes up to an elevation of 4,200 metres to the viewpoint of Silchung Peak and takes one through the settlements of the Kirati people. This route starts from Diktel Bazaar and passes through beautiful settlements like Chakhewa, Rawa Dhap, Salpa Bhanjyang, Silchung and Hanspokhari before ending in Bhojpur. There are some hotels in Diktel but trekkers are advised to carry tents. The trail offers panoramic views of most of the eight-thousanders, including Everest, Lhotse, Makalu, Cho Oyu and Kanchenjunga mountains. The spring season, March through May, is highly recommended for the trek.Janaki Mandir Janaki Mandir at Janakpur in Madhesh province was constructed in 1874 and is a blend of Mughal and local architecture. The temple is a three-storey building and has 60 rooms, making it the largest temple in Nepal. Pilgrims flock here by the thousands to pay homage to Janaki Mandir—Janaki being the other name of Sita, the daughter of King Janak. The temple houses an idol of Sita which was found near Ayodhya, the kingdom of Ram. The marriage anniversary of Lord Ram and Sita is celebrated in Janakpur every year on Vivaha Panchami, which falls in December. In the southwest corner of Janaki Mandir is the Vivaha Mandap, which has been built at the site where the marriage of Ram and Sita is said to have taken place. Another well-known temple in the vicinity is Ram Mandir, which is built in pagoda style and is hence different from the other temples in Janakpur that generally bear resemblance to Mughal architecture. It houses a female statue, said to be of Yogamaya, which has the reputation of being one of the most beautiful images of female forms in Nepal. Other holy sites of interest include the Laxman Temple, Sankat Mochan Temple and Hanuman Temple.Kuri Village, Kalinchok Kuri village, a popular tourist destination around 150 km from Kathmandu, lies at an altitude of 3,842 metres above sea level in Kalinchowk of Dolakha district, in Bagmati province. People visit the place to enjoy the snow during the winter besides the mesmerising landscapes and splendid panoramic view of the Himalayan range. Kalinchok gets snow mainly at the end of December and the snowfall continues till the end of February or mid-March. When there is snow, it is difficult for jeeps, buses and cars to reach the top of Kuri village. Chains are wrapped around the wheels of vehicles and specially modified jeeps with highly experienced drivers are used to carry visitors. There are several hotels and restaurants in the area. The road up to Kuri has also improved over the years.Annapurna Base Camp Annapurna Base Camp trek, in Gandaki province, makes for a picturesque journey that takes you to the foothills of the Annapurna South, up to 4,130 metres above sea level. The five-day trek (seven days for slow walkers) offers rich cultural diversities, typical Nepali villages and the flora and fauna nestled at the foothills of Annapurna. The distance from Pokhara to Annapurna Base Camp is approximately 81 kilometres. It is among the shortest and most budget-friendly treks in Nepal. For Nepalis, lodging costs around $5 to $10 per day. For foreigners, the overall cost of the trek ranges from $800 to $1500 on average per person. Annapurna Base Camp trek can be done at any time throughout the year as each season offers a different trekking experience. The ideal time for the trek depends on your weather preferences and what you expect from it. However, autumn (September to October) and spring (March to May) are considered the two best seasons for the trek, as the days at the time are warm and bright with clear skies.Bardiya National Park Bardiya National Park, located in the southern Tarai belt of Lumbini province, is home to one of the most elusive and majestic animals on earth—the Royal Bengal Tiger. The park, which covers an area of 968 square kilometres, is considered one of the most important protected areas in the country. It is a prime destination for those looking to catch a glimpse of a tiger. A bit of luck and patience will offer a good chance to see the Bengal Tiger. The jungle safari also offers one the opportunity to spot Asian elephants and the greater one-horned rhinoceros. The rare Gangetic river dolphins are occasionally spotted on rafting trips along the Geruwa River, the eastern channel of the Karnali river. Besides, visitors can enjoy the homestays and explore local Tharu culture. The right time to visit the park is from mid-September to mid-December and mid-February to May.Khaptad National Park Khaptad National Park in Sudurpaschim province is a protected area in the far western region. It stretches over four districts of Bajhang, Bajura, Achham and Doti and ranges in elevation from 1,400 to 3,300 metres. The park can be visited throughout the year. Trekkers are advised to bring their tents, food and other supplies. The Nepal Tourism Board says of late, social media has been increasingly influencing Nepali travellers to go to Khaptad. Since the far-flung Khaptad National Park is still offbeat for many travellers, the area remains pristine and fresh. The seasons of spring (March-May) and autumn (October-November) are the ideal times to visit the park. The temperature ranges from 10°c to 20°c offering pleasant trekking weather. The monsoon begins in June and lasts until September and during this time, roads often become muddy and slippery. From December to February, winter brings snow and chilling winds to the park.Limi Valley \nOnce again, my heart swelled with joy when my hometown came into view.Arriving at Lalikharka after the treacherous journey through Pauwa Bhanjyang and the bustling Kanchhi Dokan, Phidim, the headquarters of Panchthar district, revealed itself like a surprise gift. My home town, Phidim, is unique in the fact that it reveals to travellers approaching it from uphill. As the vehicle descends the mountain road, it slowly comes into view, its houses and buildings recognisable for the native son.This Dashain, I undertook the much-awaited trip to my hometown with my wife Kabita and daughter Aarohi. Little did I anticipate the transformation that awaited me.The moment I got out of the jeep, I noticed that Phidim, nestled in the lush hills, has undergone a remarkable transformation over the years. As I guided my family to my home, which had suffered damages in the 1989 quake that struck eastern Nepal, I found that old, mud and stone houses had been replaced by concrete buildings. The place was vastly different from the one I remembered.Arriving at my childhood home felt like reuniting with an old friend. Navigating its nooks and crannies with my daughter, we delved into the history of the house, a symbol of my cherished memories.My wife had visited Phidim years ago, spending a month with my parents. She, too, recalled beautiful moments she had had in the town. I asked the tenant about the neighbours and acquaintances. Some had died, while others had left for good.A call to local journalist Giriraj Banskota led me to the school grounds, where memories flooded back. This was where I spent my teenage years, playing ball, learning to kick, and watching major tournaments. Here, I even encountered a group of Western climbers headed to Kanchenjunga, the world’s third-highest mountain. I remember being awed by their shiny yellow tents, headlights and strange smell. I remember practising my tutephuteko Angrezi with the climbers. Birendra Shield, an annual sports tournament named after the late king, brought ace players from various schools in Panchthar district. The district also hosted Yuba Mela, an annual three-day fair to commemorate the birthday of the king, organising football tournaments in which teams from as far as Sunsari and Taplejung participated. I never excelled at dribbling balls. A boy growing up in a seven-member family, I soon found my interest in literature. In the late 1980s, Phidim hosted a major literary festival. In the run-up to the 1990 pro-democracy protest, walls were painted with anti-monarchy slogans, local politicians were arrested. I took my family to my school, Naya Namuna Secondary School. It was Saturday, so the school was closed. I peeked through the steel gate and wall, imagining myself labouring over classes. Memories are hazy, but what I remember most is going out of the school—to quiz contests with me leading the school team, to essay competitions at the District Education Office and to play carom board, a national pastime, in a nearby shopfront. Returning to the main street, the demolition of a landmark gate made me reflect on how cities transform, shedding old landmarks for new identities. Navigating narrow alleyways, I felt like a stranger in my own hometown. Multistory buildings have emerged and roads have been paved, reshaping the town. It’s the same place with a different face, leaving me nostalgic for the Phidim of my memories.We finally reached Shivalaya temple, which I told my wife and daughter was one of my cherished hangouts. A giant statue of Falgunanda (the Kirant leader’s birthday is celebrated on November 10) stood before the steps to the temple. Though my wife suspected I came here to smoke, in reality, I visited the temple in the evening to meet friends and talk about issues that mattered most to us at the time. It also offered a panoramic view of the town (I could not take my family to Gadhi Danda, a hillock across the Shivalaya).Towards the end of my journey, I felt sad about Phidim’s lack of prospects. To my dismay, I found that people have been leaving the town in droves. Despite blacktopped roads and multi-story buildings, Phidim faces a troubling reality. The lack of quality higher education and specialist healthcare has driven people away, echoing the circumstances that led me to Kathmandu years ago. Conversations with locals confirmed a mass exodus from the town, a trend that raises concerns about Phidim's future.My conversations with familiar strangers led me to conclude that Phidim has transformed into a transit town for pilgrims heading to Pathibhara Devi Temple, which is around 255 kilometres north in Taplejung district. I met dozens of people headed to the holy site. While pilgrims see it as a stopover, for me, it was a homecoming. The realisation dawned that Phidim is, perhaps, in a state of transition, trading its rustic charm for the hallmarks of urbanisation. While I left Phidim for higher education in Kathmandu, people from rural areas have flocked to the town in search of better opportunities, bringing life and energy to the once quiet community.As we bid adieu to my hometown, I couldn’t help but reflect on the inevitability of leaving a place, no matter how enamoured one is with it. Passing Kanchhi Dokan, I pointed out Kanchnajungha and Kumbhakarna to my daughter—symbols of my childhood. Phidim, now a blend of nostalgia and change, remains etched in my heart, a testament to the intricate dance between memory and evolution. \nInter Milan escaped Etihad Stadium with a surprise 0-0 draw against Manchester City in the Champions League on Wednesday, exacting a small measure of revenge for their narrow loss to Pep Guardiola’s side in the 2023 final.Both teams squandered numerous chances in a breathless back-and-forth affair. City were largely stalled by Inter’s impressive discipline in defence, while Simone Inzaghi’s Inter, who were dangerous on the break on a nervy night for both sides, were wayward with their finishing.“We faced a really difficult team,” Guardiola said. “I’m still really, really satisfied for the game we played, especially with how (Inter) defended, they are masters of that, so big, they help each other unbelievably. So you cannot expect to create a lot of chances.”Inzaghi was similarly pleased with his squad’s night.“I said ‘well done guys’, they put in a giant performance,” the manager said. “I asked them to play exactly as they did. We all know Manchester City, what they are capable of, we knew we had to pull out all the stops, play a great game and we did it.”City’s goal machine Erling Haaland, who would have become the fastest player in history to record 100 goals for a European club had he scored, will have to wait to achieve that milestone.The Norwegian, who has nine goals in four Premier League games this season, narrowly missed a couple of first-half chances including a header that keeper Yann Sommer jumped up to grab on the line, and a hard, low shot that rolled just wide of the post.Henrikh Mkhitaryan had City fans breathing a huge sigh of relief when he missed a late chance, launching a rocket just over the bar from about eight metres out, then holding his head in disbelief.At the other end, Ilkay Gundogan elicited huge groans from City fans after twice failing to convert with close-range headers in the dying seconds. He launched the first one straight at the keeper, with the second one glancing just over the bar right before the final whistle.City fired 22 shots to Inter’s 13 but only had one more shot on target than their visitors with five.Under the new Champions League format, teams play eight matches against eight different opponents, with the top eight sides in the 36-team league automatically advancing to the last 16, and the next 16 playing a further knockout round.It was a lacklustre performance for four-time defending English champions City, who are in a familiar spot sitting atop the Premier League table after four games with a 100% record. Inter are third in the Serie A table.One negative on the night was a potential injury to City captain Kevin De Bruyne, who appeared to pick up a knock late in the first half and did not play in the second.His team face another intense contest on Sunday when they host Arsenal, who sit two points behind them in the table.City, who edged Inter 1-0 to hoist the 2023 Champions League trophy in Istanbul as part of their treble, were eliminated by eventual winners Real Madrid in the quarter-finals of Europe's top competition last season, while Atletico Madrid ousted Inter in the round of 16. \nNepal Police Club missed their chance to leapfrog Tribhuvan Army Club to the second spot in the ANFA Women’s League after they were held to a goalless stalemate by sixth-placed Chandrapur Municipality at the ANFA Complex in Lalitpur on Wednesday.Police also had to rely on a goalkeeping heroics from Usha Nath to avoid a shock loss late in the game as the goalkeeper saved a penalty kick from Dil Kumari Magar, helping the departmental side preserve their unbeaten run in the league.The draw—second in a row and third in the season—will still have damaging consequences to Police as the outcome left them four points adrift of leaders and reigning champions Armed Police Force Club, who are on 16 points.Police have 12 points from six games.Army occupy second position with 13 points.Police were not at their best and had to wait until the 34th minute to have a clean chance at goal when Niru Thapa outran two Chandrapur defenders to set up Nirmala Upadhyaya inside the penalty area but Chandrapur goalkeeper Usha Thapa reacted quickly to save Upadhyaya’s shot.Niru also set up Anuska Sherpa with a beautiful through pass in the final minute of the first half but Chandrapur goalkeeper Thapa came to the rescue again with her quick thinking.Chandrapur came close to scoring in the injury time of the first half after a poor defending from Samikshya Ghimire allowed Sunita Sunar from an open play but she ended up shooting wide.Police almost found the lead five minutes into the break when Niru’s strike beat Chandrapur’s goalie Usha, who had come far off the post to check Ghim Kumari Gurung’s clever pass, but the shot could not find the target.Chandrapur had a golden chance to punish misfiring Police in the 71st minute from the penalty kick. They were awarded the penalty after Ghimire handled the ball inside the area but Police goalkeeper Nath stretched full length to deny Magar and saved her side from the jaws of defeat.In the later action, Karnali Province registered their first victory of the season with a 3-0 victory against Sudurpaschim Province.Bhumika Budhathoki put Karnali in front in the 24th minute capitalising on an opportunity by Garima Rai, who twisted and turned to outwit Sudurpaschim defenders before putting it on the plate for Budhathoki.Rai then combined with Budhathoki to double Karnali’s lead in the 62nd minute, before Barsha Oli finished off a counter attack to wrap up a comfortable victory.Karnali stayed in the ninth position with four points. Sudurpaschim are rock bottom after facing their sixth defeat in six matches. Bagmati Youth Club play against Waling Municipality on Thursday. \nFormer Italy striker Salvatore Schillaci, a star of the 1990 World Cup on home soil, has died at the age of 59, his former clubs Inter Milan and Juventus said on Wednesday.Schillaci led Italy to their third-place finish in 1990, winning the Golden Boot for his six goals during the tournament, including in the semi-final against Argentina and in their third-place victory over England.“A football icon is leaving us, a man who has entered the hearts of Italians and sports fans around the world,” Italy’s prime minister Giorgia Meloni posted on X.“Salvatore Schillaci, known by everyone as Toto, the striker from the magic nights of Italia ‘90 with our national team. Thanks for the emotions you gave us, for having made us dream, celebrate, embrace, and wave our national flag. Bon voyage, champion.”The Sicilian’s wide eyes as he celebrated his goals became one of the enduring images of that World Cup and his was the name on all Italians’ lips, outshining more established players such as Gianluca Vialli and Roberto Baggio.Schillaci was awarded the Golden Ball as player of the tournament and was later named as the runner-up for the 1990 Ballon d’Or men’s player of the year award, behind World Cup winning captain Lothar Matthaus of West Germany.He had started Italy’s opening World Cup game as a substitute but came off the bench to score the winner in a 1-0 victory over Austria.After the excitement of 1990, Schillaci scored only one more goal for Italy and did not appear for them at any other major tournaments.A small, bustling striker, Schillaci, nicknamed “Toto”, had been a late developer, spending the early years of his career playing in the lower leagues for Sicilian club Messina.He was the top scorer in Serie B, the Italian second division, in 1988-89, earning him a move to Serie A giants Juventus.“We immediately fell in love with Toto. With his desire, his story, his passion,” Juventus said in a statement.“We at Juve were lucky enough to get excited about him before, in that incredible summer of 1990, the whole of Italy did.”Schillaci helped Juventus to claim the Coppa Italia and UEFA Cup in 1989-90 before winning the latter trophy again four years later with Inter Milan.Serie A President Lorenzo Casini paid tribute to Schillaci.“He was a champion who lit up the “magic nights” of Italia 90,” he said.“His desire to reach the top levels in soccer has been and will remain a source of inspiration for so many youngsters pursuing their dream of playing in Serie A.”He then became the first Italian player to play in Japan’s J.League and won the league title with his club Jubilo Iwata in 1997.He retired from football in 1999.The Italian Football Association’s (FIGC) president Gabriele Gravina said Schillaci was a symbol of will and redemption.“It is precisely this indomitable spirit that... will make him immortal,” he added. \nThe French Embassy in Nepal on Monday honoured Palesha Goverdhan, Nepal’s first Paralympic medallist.French Ambassador Virginie Corteval, Tanka Lal Ghising, member-secretary of the National Sports Council, and sports representatives and business leaders, among others, congratulated Goverdhan for her hard work and success.“Palesha, you are a beacon of hope and determination,” said Corteval. “Your journey reflects the audacity to dream and conquer challenges. You have revealed the immense talent of Nepali athletes to the world.”The event also served as an opportunity to introduce the Choose France/Marque France initiative, which encourages collaboration in business, culture and education between France and other countries, including Nepal, the embassy said.In alignment with the values of the Choose France/Marque France campaign, Goverdhan’s achievement reflects the spirit of perseverance, cooperation, and excellence that both nations strive to promote, the embassy said.As part of the Choose France initiative, the embassy announced Choose France Tour, scheduled for September 28 at the Alliance Française, where Nepali students will have the chance to learn more about studying in France and meet the representatives from more than 15 prestigious French educational institutions.Goverdhan made history on August 31, defeating Serbia’s Marija Micev 15-8 in the bronze medal match to become the first Nepali athlete to win a Paralympic medal. \nIn 2008 Matina Shakya was only three years old when she was appointed as the Kumari of Kathmandu. She was succeeded by Trishna Shakya as the new Kumari in 2017.Kumaris are revered as goddesses of beauty and strength in certain Hindu and Buddhist traditions. Worshipping young girls as Kumaris is a 2,000-year-old practice in Nepal. Since the 13th century, when the Malla kings ruled, the Newars of the Kathmandu Valley have been worshipping Kumari, a girl from the Shakya/Bajracharya community chosen to embody the divine energy of goddess Taleju Bhawani. The reign of a Kumari ends when she starts menstruating. So long as she is serving as the Kumari, she is believed to be the nation’s divine protector, safeguarding it from evil. Matina, 18, is now in her first year of college, studying for a bachelor’s degree in management. Her father, Pratapman Shakya, when asked about having a daughter who is the only living the goddess in the world said, “Not having your own daughter live in the same house as you seemed a little unfair, but we feel very proud to call ourselves the parents of the royal Kumari who is revered by people all over the world.”On March 9, 2023, he, along with Matina, were getting ready for a special function held to honour all former Kumaris from across Nepal. “There are often events to honour Matina as she was the royal Kumari, but this one was dedicated to all former Kumaris from different areas. There are 129 living Kumaris in all,” he added. Besides Kathmandu, Kumari tradition is followed in Bhaktapur, Lalitpur, and Kirtipur, among other cities.According to him, this was the first time an event like this was organised and the Deputy Mayor of Kathmandu, Sunita Dangol, was also in attendance.Throughout the year, many people line up outside the ‘Kumari Ghar’ to get a chance to visit the Kumari and get her blessings. Many foreigners stand out in the yard to catch a glimpse of her. Nepali people believe that if a Kumari smiles at you, it is a bad omen.Everyday, a tutor visits the Kumari to help her continue with her education as she is not allowed to step outside the Kumari Ghar. She takes her exams and does her homework from the Kumari Ghar itself. She also has the freedom to play inside the Kumari Ghar. Many former kumaris have pursued careers in their fields of interest or studied after their term ends, and they continue to be treated with the same respect. The tradition of Kumari has evolved over time. In the past Kumaris did not enjoy these freedoms.Because of various superstitious beliefs, Kumaris were not fully educated and were forbidden from getting married because of the belief that the groom would die soon if he married an ex-Kumari. They led secluded lives, were restricted from participating in normal childhood activities, and focused solely on their religious duties.However, now, these myths have been dispelled. Modern understanding has shifted to recognise that Kumaris, after stepping down from their divine role, have the freedom to marry and lead a normal life. The perception of Kumaris as isolated figures has evolved, with a focus on providing them with a more balanced upbringing. There have been initiatives to integrate Kumaris into regular social and educational settings, allowing them to have a more holistic and fulfilling childhood experience. “Matina was already familiar with the students from the school that she attended after her term as Kumari ended,” said Shakya. “The kids visited the Kumari Ghar frequently so that she could have a smooth transition,” he added. According to Gautam Prasad Shakya, who has been living as a caretaker in the Kumari Ghar, the changes made to the tradition are minor. “The traditions of Kumari have mostly stayed the same. All the rituals are still practised like in the old days,” he said.On 6 May 2005, Pun Devi Maharjan, a lawyer, filed a case in the Supreme Court claiming that the traditional practice of electing young girls as Kumaris, or “goddesses’, who are expected to follow certain social restrictions and appear at religious festivals, violated the rights of the child. Quoting Maharjan’s complaint, Puskar Mathema writes in Yuwamanch Monthly of October 2007, “If Kumari tradition is continued, it will undermine the fundamental rights as well the freedoms of children guaranteed by the constitution and child rights treaties. Apart from this, it will have a negative impact on their physical and mental development.”The case continued while Nepal overthrew the monarchy and declared itself a secular state in 2007. When the judgement was pronounced in 2008, the goddess was still in her role, now giving blessings to the country’s President. The court ordered that the Kumaris and ex-Kumaris receive better benefits and arrangements and ordered the government to improve their support and allowances.In April 2006, Prof Chunda Bajracharya filed a petition at the Supreme Court against Maharjan’s petition, who had argued against the Kumari tradition. Bajracharya contended that the tradition should be preserved as heritage due to its over 100 years of history.“People who don’t understand the culture shouldn’t comment on it,” she stated. Bajracharya also criticised the human right activists who contended that Kumaris were only allowed to wear the colour red. “People who say Kumaris are forced to wear red clothing all the time, are the same people who send their kids to schools in uniform,” she said.“After the 2008 court verdict, there have been a lot of improvements. Now, a teacher visits the Kumari Ghar daily to tutor the Kumari, who is expected to complete school assignments and sit periodic exams. All the former Kumaris now get benefits like scholarships and special pensions,” she added.Bajracharya is currently a professor of literature at the Tribhuvan University in Kathmandu.“The only significant change that the court verdict brought to the tradition was in terms of her education,” said Gautam Prasad Shakya, the caretaker. “Kumaris were tutored long before the case, but the case helped formalise this arrangement. After the court verdict, the time between 12 pm and 4 pm was designated as the Kumari’s tuition time,” he added.After the verdict, there was a concerted effort to provide Kumaris with access to quality education, enabling them to develop the skills and knowledge needed to lead fulfilling lives beyond their divine roles. There was also a shift towards ensuring that the Kumari's living quarters are comfortable, safe, and conducive to her overall well-being.Moreover, the selection process for the Kumari underwent reforms in the aftermath of the Pun Devi Maharjan case. There was a push for greater transparency, accountability, and inclusivity in the selection of the Kumari, with an emphasis on ensuring that the process was fair, respectful, and free from undue influence.Efforts were made to support their transition into adulthood, including providing them with comprehensive resources for education, vocation, and social integration. This shift aimed to address the challenges faced by former Kumaris and empower them to lead independent and fulfilling lives after their divine service.“The Kumari tradition has evolved over time. During the tenure of my daughter, we saw a lot of improvements. Even after her time as Kumari, Matina continued to get a lot of government support,” said Shakya, former Kumari Matina’s father.“Some people argue that child rights are being violated, but all of her rights are being upheld inside the Kumari Ghar. This is a unique and respected aspect of Nepali culture, and I don’t believe it violates any of my child’s rights.”While the Kumari tradition continues, its practices have evolved. “She enjoys this normal life and it didn’t take her long to adjust as well,” says Matina’s father, on her transition from the revered Kumari to the ordinary Matina. \nWhat animals did Juddha Shumsher have in his zoo?“We only have records of animals from the mid-1960s,” says Ganesh Koirala, who has been employed at the Central Zoo for the past 36 years and currently serves as its information officer and programme officer. “That too I hand-copied from an old torn-down file that I came across.”Today, the Central Zoo, which sprawls across six hectares in Jawalakhel, Lalitpur, houses as many as 1,298 wild animals of different species of mammals, reptiles, fishes and birds from Nepal and around the world—from tiger, rhinoceros, hippopotamus and red panda to its recent attraction: a pair of chimpanzees.After enduring decades of neglect under various government bodies, with its animals and infrastructure scraping along in a deplorable state, the zoo received a new lease of life with improved infrastructure and animal care in 1995, when it came under the management of the King Mahendra Trust for Nature Conservation (KMTNC), now known as the National Trust for Nature Conservation, in 1995.Today, the Central Zoo is an entertainment venue, one of the most happening places in the Kathmandu valley. Flocked by thousands of daily visitors, the zoo now also hosts rescued animals and those in need of rehabilitation. It is also a site for conservation education.But when Juddha Shumsher Rana (prime minister from 1932–1945) built the Jawalakhel Zoological Garden on the premises of his Jawalakhel Durbar (where Nepal Administrative Staff College stands today) in 1932, he did so purely for private interests—as a space of entertainment and amusement for him and his family.Built in the semi-wilderness of Jawalakhel around a historical pond dating to the 17th century during the reign of King Siddhi Narsingh Malla, the zoo also became the space he could use to show his respect for two women he revered, his mother and sister-in-law, and indulge in one of his favourite pastimes—gambling.Today, the Central Zoo, nestled in the heart of Jawalakhel's sprawling crowd, does not go unnoticed, and its story is well told. But what passions drove Juddha to build the zoo? What was its original layout? What animals did it have in the beginning? And how did Juddha spend time there?“I remember once seeing a small board that read ‘Jawalakhel Zoological Garden’,” Koirala says. “I don’t know whether it was from Juddha’s time or was made in the later years. It must surely be that Juddha built the zoo out of influence from the British given how this term was used by them.”Koirala adds, “There is a former employee, now an elderly gentleman who worked in the zoo in the 1960s. He surely has some stories from Juddha’s time.”Birds, beasts and palacesTo trace the birth of Jawalakhel Zoological Garden, one has to look at the history of Nepal’s rulers owning birds and animals.Like rulers around the world, Nepal’s royalty kept wild and exotic birds and animals in captivity as a source of pleasure and mark of wealth and power. The book ‘Social History of Nepal’ by historians TR Vaidya, Tri Ratna Manandhar and Shankar Lal Joshi details how Mallas during the mediaeval Kathmandu Valley to Ranas and Shahs in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries owned rare, exotic creatures. In 1708, a rhinoceros in Kathmandu Valley broke the iron chain in which it was bound and killed its tamer. In 1714, Bhaktapur’s King Bhupatindra Malla gifted a camel and an elephant to Kantipur’s King Bhaskar Malla to build peace.Among Shahs, King Rana Bahadur Shah in particular was reputed for his collection of birds and animals. He also owned a zoo outside his palace in Basantapur Durbar Square, where the Nepal Bank Limited stands in New Road today. The zoo contained “tiger, bear, monkey, elephant, horse, deer… heron, peacock… pigeon, wild dogs, rabbits, rats, mongoose.”Jung Bahadur Rana’s zoo on the premises of his Thapathali Durbar hosted a variety of birds and animals collected during his hunting expeditions as well as those brought from abroad. Jung Bahadur himself used to “supervise and inspect it”. Juddha Shumsher likewise had his own collection of creatures which steadily expanded into a zoological garden. Seeking wilderness in his Jawalakhel DurbarJuddha’s biographer Ishwari Prasad writes in ‘The Life and Times of Maharaja Juddha Shumsher Jung Bahadur Rana’ that between 1933 and 1940, Juddha shot 433 tigers, 33 rhinoceros and 93 leopards. An insatiable big-game hunter, Juddha had a deep fondness for being in the wild and among wild animals, and from this came, according to oral history prevalent among members of Kathmandu’s Rana community including Juddha’s descendants, the desire to own a zoo.Built in 1752, Schönbrunn Zoo in Vienna, the world’s first modern zoo, was already over 100 years old when Juddha was born in 1875. London Zoo opened in 1828 and Alipore Zoological Garden (Kolkata Zoo) in 1875. Nawab Wajid Ali Shah Zoological Garden (Lucknow Zoo) was established in 1921. Juddha’s inspiration, his descendants say, was most likely reinforced by his tours to zoological gardens during his visits to England in 1908 and to different Indian cities.An article titled ‘Central zoo in state of neglect’ published in The Kathmandu Post in 1996 says that Juddha one day “received a pair of leopards as a gift”, cementing his desire to own a zoo. A report ‘Central Zoo Master Plan’ prepared by the KMTNC in 1996 says that Juddha decided to build a zoo in an epiphany when he saw that some animals “including deer, a few rhinos, and some tigers had been collected from the Tarai and kept in Kathmandu” could be put into one compound in the “lonely piece of land with a large 16th [sic] century Malla period Pokhari”.The pond lay still and serene surrounded by green wilderness ever since Patan’s King Siddhi Narsingh Malla built it in the 1600s. On the grounds surrounding this pond, the Newars from Na:Tole, Pulchowk and surroundings had their devisthans where, for centuries, they gathered to perform their religious ceremonies during Basanta Panchami and Bhoto Jatra even after this area fell within the Jawalakhel Durbar.For the palace, the ground served as its extended garden along with a horse and elephant stable. Subodh Rana, 69, grandson of Juddha Shumsher, recalled his father Kiran Shumsher telling him that Juddha and his family sometimes also used the scenic grounds for picnics. If there was any spot where Juddha wanted to build a menagerie, it would be around this Pokhari (pond). One day, he called his grandson General Maheshwar Shumsher Rana and deputed him to the task of doing just this.The zoo’s layout—except for the small plots of lands acquired later—that was in place when it came under KMTNC's management was, the present and retired zoo officials believe, mostly the same as it was built by Maheshwar and so offers a peek into how Juddha’s zoo must have been like. Pond in the middle of the ground surrounded by enclosures—the southern bank housing mainly larger animals, and cages for birds positioned on the northern banks.From pigeons to the king of the jungleWhat animals and birds did the enclosures at Juddha’s zoo house?“We cannot tell for sure,” Koirala says.Once it came under government ownership, the zoo was tossed from one institution to the other for lack of interest and knowledge on the right institution to manage it. Amid all this chaos, documents were possibly lost and the zoo has no concrete record about the animals that Juddha must have once taken amusement at, said Koirala.Mukti Narayan Shrestha, 82, a retired secretary of the Nepal government, joined the Central Zoo in 1970 as a veterinarian when many original structures of the zoo were still intact. Shrestha also worked with an elderly khardar who, he says, was employed in the zoo since the time of Juddha and was about to retire when he joined.“In those days where the purpose of menageries was exclusively for exhibition and pleasure with no regard for the welfare and recreation of animals and birds, the cages were tiny and iron-barred,” Shrestha says.Elephant, horses, deer, monkeys, tiger, rhinoceros, clouded leopard, red panda, bear, palm civet (nir biralo), four-horned antelope, Himalayan goral, pheasants, Himalayan monal—from the mythical and the majestic, the gentle and friendly to the fiery and ferocious, Juddha’s zoo boasted them all, Shrestha says.Shrestha’s account is not different from the anecdotes passed down to other retired and present zoo officials and the members of the Rana community, who also detail the rare and the exotic fauna, like the gharial crocodile and porcupine, even the jungle’s king—creatures, they say, that Juddha must have received from foreigners as gifts—appearing alongside domestic birds like pigeons.Tidbits of published information also confirm that the zoo had a good collection of exotic birds and animals from Nepal and abroad. One such suggestion comes from Kalyan Shumsher’s ‘Shree Teen Juddha Mahima’ published during Juddha’s reign in 1943.“One need not travel abroad to see the incredible birds and animals found in foreign countries,” he writes. “It will suffice to see [those creatures] right here in the zoo opened by His Holiness Shree 3 [Juddha] in Jawalakhel.”Among these incredible creatures, one reigned supreme—lion, the king of the jungle.For one, it would not have satiated Juddha to build a zoo and not have the jungle’s king exhibited in it. Juddha hence must have done everything possible to ensure one for the zoo. Infrastructure at the zoo suggests that the lion indeed lived at Juddha’s zoo or, in the least, during the Rana regime.“Where bear habitat lies today, there were two dome-shaped attached enclosures with a holding room, constructed in the classic architecture that many enclosures in the British zoos had in the past. They had brick walls and lime plaster,” Koirala says. “These were built to house a lion in one cage and a tiger in the other.”Near these enclosures stood another cage that remains intact today, with the head of a roaring lion carved out of the wall on the top of its iron bars. Zoo officials as well as members of the Rana community believe that Juddha had this exhibit built to specifically house a lion.Remarkably, these Juddha-era infrastructural spaces are corroborated by a rare piece of photographic evidence. A 1946 photo of the zoo shows a lion while a Kathmandu mother and her sons stand in front of its cage.Juddha’s place of piety and playThe zoo was not merely a space that Juddha sought out for amusement and retreat in the outpost of his palace; he also used this place to express his deepest affection.This affection spills right at the zoo’s entrance, in the form of the life-size statue of Karma Kumari Devi, wife of Juddha’s elder brother and Rana Prime Minister Dev Shumsher. Karma Kumari stands tall in her regal costume shaded by a wide canopy. Juddha revered Karma Kumari because it was she who raised him and looked after his mother Juhar Kumari Devi after the death of his father Dhir Shumsher. On another prominent part of the zoo on the south-east, Juhar Kumari’s enthroned statue overlooks the pond. Juddha had commissioned the London-based sculptor Domenico Antonio Tonelli to cast these statues.When Karma Kumari’s statue was unveiled is not clear, but Juhar Kumari’s statue was unveiled by Juddha amid a grand function in 1935 on Jawalakhel’s most auspicious day, Bhoto Jatra. It was attended by the British Resident Frederick Bailey.“On June 28, 1935, at Jawalakhel Durbar… the pond nearby looked very scenic,” says a Gorkhapatra news report titled ‘Statue installation’ dated July 5, 1935. “Because it was the day of Bhoto Jatra of Machhindranath… and moreover since an ideal woman’s statue was being unveiled, there was a crowd of lakhs of people.”Less than fifty metres from Karma Kumari’s statue stands a one-story building with a pagoda roof that today serves as the zoo’s meeting hall. Juddha, an avid gambler, found the scenic semi-wilderness covered in trees and filled with the sounds of wildlife to be a perfect place to relish the game. So he built a building with twelve doors on its four sides allowing him and his fellow gambling compatriots the freedom to enter through a particular door that they thought would bring luck. He called it his Juwa Ghar, the gambling house, and built it with the sole purpose of indulging in the game he loved. Roar of lion reverberates in KathmanduThe sounds of the animals and birds in the zoo rose up in the Jawalakhel sky. Every day, until much later in the 1970s, roar of the zoo’s lion (there were later other lions) diffused to far corners of the Valley, merging the zoo with the spirit of Kathmandu and informing the city folks of its presence.But was the zoo open to the public as well?“I think once it was built, the zoo was open for the public,” Subodh Rana said. “It is unlikely that Juddha Shumsher built such a large zoo and kept it only for his family.”For one, Kalyan Shumsher mentioning that one “need not travel abroad to see the incredible birds and animals found in foreign countries” suggests that the public had at least some access to the zoo. Of course, the Newar community from Na:Tole, Pulchowk and surrounding areas were permitted inside the zoo on the days of their guthi functions on Basanta Panchami and Bhoto Jatra.As the zoo was established at the back of the ground where Bhoto Jatra celebrations happen, it naturally filled with revellers on this day in addition to the guthi ritual observers as testified by the Gorkhapatra report. The photo of the mother and her sons also bear testimony that the zoo was not entirely closed to the public.What is widely believed, though, is that the zoo officially came under government ownership after Nepal became a democracy in 1951. And it would still be a few more years before it was open to the public in 1956.In 1945, Juddha gave up his power and eventually retired in Dehradun, India, where he died in 1952. With time, Jawalakhel Zoological Garden became the Central Zoo. It would take many avatars—a neglected site of crammed, unmaintained cages with sad eyes of emaciated creatures staring from behind the bars, a focal point of animal diplomacy, particularly during the period of monarchy, to, in its recent decades, a space of conservation and education.When all this was happening, the city sprawled around Jawalakhel, subduing the lion’s roar with its noise. More wildlife from around the country and the world came—creatures captured from the wild, those sold by circuses, those rescued from traffickers. Fate would bring these creatures to the care of generations of Kathmandu folks, intertwining each other’s joys and sorrows. After the tale of Juddha’s Jawalakhel Zoological Garden, there would be these stories to tell. Sitting around a table inside Juddha’s Juwa Ghar, Koirala and other zoo officials begin unfolding these stories before me. \nNepal’s book market is no stranger to the popular Bangladeshi-Swedish writer Taslima Nasrin. Almost all of her books have been translated into Nepali, but Nasrin herself says that they are all unauthorised translations. “All books [Nepali translations] are pirated versions,” Nasrin told the Post in a Whatsapp conversation. Nasrin, who is currently in exile in India after facing death threats in Bangladesh following the publication of her novel Lajja (Shame), said that she or her publishers have never allowed anyone the right to translate her books into Nepali. “I don’t know of any such Nepali publishers. No one asked for permission and no one has paid [me] royalty.”Translating and publishing books without permission from authors or publishers is a punishable crime. But Nepal’s book market is full of such unauthorised translations and prints of books written by the who’s who of the world literature. Such endeavours haven’t just hurt the authors but also the readers, says Ajit Baral, publisher of the Kathmandu-based Fineprint publication. “These translations are poor,” Baral says. “Tomes with 1200–1300 pages have been trimmed to 200–300 pages. An example is the biography of Bill Clinton.”Another popular book that has seen unauthorised Nepali translation is the biography of Steve Jobs by Walter Isaacson.“We have no official deal in place for a [Nepali] translation of Steve Jobs,” Peppa Mignone, associate agent of the CAA, the translation authority of the biography, said in an email interview with the Post.The book’s Nepali translation is published by Panchpokhari Publication House. The translated book identifies the translator thus: “Achyut Koirala, who has a master’s in English literature, is primarily a journalist. He is currently affiliated with Nagarik daily. He keeps a close tab on international history, politics and culture and has written scripts and dialogues for half a dozen Nepali films. He has published over a dozen non-fiction books.”Koirala, who admits to the unauthorised translation, claims that he hasn’t just translated the book but has also done ‘creative writing’ with it.‘Rich Dad Poor Dad’, written by Robert Kiyosaki and Sharon Lechter, is among the books that’s perennially on the bestseller list across the world. Upon investigation, the Post found three Nepali translations of the book—all unauthorised. One of them is translated by Dilip Kumar Shrestha and published by the same firm, the Panchpokhari Publication House. Another Nepali iteration of the book is published by Book For All publication and translated by Kopila MD. Yet another Nepali version is translated by one Sudheer Dixit and published by Plata Publication, Kathmandu.In an email conversation with the Post, Ronson Taylor, who oversees the international rights at The Rich Dad Company, said, “At this point in time, we do not have a relationship with an established publisher in the [Nepali] language market. If there are any Rich Dad Poor Dad books currently for sale in the Nepali market, they are pirated.”Basanta Thapa, a writer and translator, says that many books are being translated of late to make easy money. “But how would the quality of these unauthorised translations be!” Thapa wonders. “Readers who haven’t read the original wouldn’t know the faults in the translated versions.” Thapa says that any translator worth his salt aims to ‘recreate’ a book and it takes much work to do that.Taslima’s books are the major victimsTaslima’s memoir Uttal Hawa has been translated into Nepali as ‘Sangharsha’, literally Struggle, and is published by Khoji Publication House. Even though the book in its cover claims that it is an authorised translation from the English version Wild Wind, it is a pirated one. The book is translated by Bikash Basnet and edited by Bhogiraj Chamling. A revised version of the book is edited by Sangeet Srota (Yam Bahadur Chhetri).The same publication house has also published the Nepali translation of the book’s sequel as ‘Prem ra Jeevan’. Publisher Sushil Chalise says that while he is aware that one needs to receive permission from the author or the publisher to translate a book, his efforts to contact Taslima were unsuccessful. Therefore, he had published the version the translator made available to him. Translator Basnet, too, admits he translated the book without Taslima’s permission. “About a decade back, we didn’t know how to ask for permission,” he said.Nepal has the Copyright Act (2002) in place. Before it, there was the The Patent, Design and Trade Mark Act, 2022 (1965) that included intellectual property in its 2006 revision. Even the Muluki Ain (Civil Code) of 1910 BS had a provision about copyright. Moreover, it goes without saying that translating somebody else’s work without permission is immoral.Likewise, Indigo Ink Pvt Ltd has published a Nepali translation of Taslima’s anthology of essays No Country for Women as ‘Aaimai ko Kunai Desh Chhaina’. The book is translated by Krishna Giri and edited by Pramod Pradhan. “I have no idea about the agreement between the publisher and translator,” Pradhan, who is also a children’s book writer, says. “I just copy-edited it upon request.”Bishnukumar Poudel, publisher of Indigo Ink, however, claims that he is still trying to take translation rights for the book. “We translated the book long ago,” he says. “We are still trying to get translation rights.”Indigo is also publishing unauthorised translations under its imprints All Book Store Pvt Ltd, Book for All and Plata Publication. It has published two versions of Rich Dad Poor Dad under those shadow imprints. But Plata Publication is not registered in the Company Registrar’s Office.Pradhan says that many foreign books have had unauthorised translations in Nepali and their quality is poor. Those books are translated not from the original language but from a second or third language, so these translations are bound to have problems, he says. “After I learned that those were unauthorised translations, I have stopped editing them,” Pradhan said.Indian author Shiv Khera’s You Can Win has been translated into Nepali by Bloomsbury India and has granted the distribution rights to Ekta Books. But the book’s unauthorised translations are also found in the market and they don’t even mention the name of the publisher and translator. What is interesting is they mention that it’d be illegal to republish the book, or an excerpt of it, without the author’s permission.The Nepali translation of the book, which was poorly written and rife with inaccuracies, had landed the publisher at court. After a complaint was filed at the District Court Kathmandu in 2066BS on the charge that the publisher violated the copyrights and economic rights, the court had issued a verdict on Mangsir 11 that year, charging a fine of Rs10,000, Rs20,000 and Rs30,000 to the defendants Netra Prasad Pokharel, Narayan Prasad Bhusal, and Bhagwati Risal and Bishnu Silwal, respectively.Baral, the Fineprint publisher, says that international publishers wouldn’t demand much for translation rights given Nepal’s small market, but Nepali publishers do not bother to reach out to them. “Publishers who put out unauthorised translations and sell them at 50 percent discount have troubled publishers like us,” he said.Fineprint has published authorised translated versions of books such as Leaving Microsoft to Change the World by John Wood, Healed by Manisha Koirala, and Hippie by Paulo Coelho. The publication house is also set to release the Nepali translation of Israeli historian Yuval Noah Harari’s bestseller Sapiens. Translated into Nepali by Dinesh Kafle, the book’s translation right was acquired at the cost of USD1300, Baral said. Likewise, the publication acquired the translation rights of Sadhguru’s Inner Engineering at IRS93,000, he added.Baral says that publication of unauthorised translations is an immoral and illegal work. “This phenomenon not just hampers Nepal’s fledgling book publishing industry but also tarnishes the country’s reputation in the global market,” Baral said.Thapa, the writer and translator, points out the lack of regulatory mechanisms in the country. “We don’t have an agency that regulates the quality of translations being done,” he says. “Nobody compares the translation with the original. We need a dedicated authority to enhance the quality of translation.” Universities, Nepal Academy and other stakeholders can play a role to uplift the translation sector, he adds.One’s pain, another’s pleasureWhen the author Suketu Mehta was travelling through Mumbai, a young man approached him with a handful of books while his vehicle was stuck in traffic. Brandishing Maximum City, written by none other than Mehta himself, the young man requested the author to buy a copy. Suketu leafed through the book and said, “This is a pirated copy and I’m the author of this book.” The youth wasn’t bothered and replied, “Okay, you can buy it at a discount.”This anecdote was shared to the Post by Mehta’s friend, the author and professor Amitava Kumar, in an email exchange.Most of these pirated books are imported into Nepal from India while the retailers of original books are finding themselves increasingly in trouble. “We sell original copies but many readers doubt us as well, given the ubiquity of pirated versions,” says Anjan Shrestha, operator of Education Book House, Jamal.Ramchandra Timothy, chair of Thapathali-based Ekta Books Pvt Ltd, said that the phenomenon of piracy has tarnished Nepal’s image internationally. “There was a time when Bangladesh would be known as ‘piracy king’,” he said. “Now there's a risk Nepal would take the crown.”As tax increases, so does piracyThe government decision to impose a 10 percent tax on book imports in fiscal year 2019-20 led to a proliferation of pirated book markets, booksellers say. After the decision, booksellers started to cut back on imports and that led to the entry of a new crop of pirated booksellers, a trader in Kathmandu says. But following widespread backlash, then finance minister Bishnu Paudel struck down the policy.“After the government’s decision, we stopped importing books for a while,” says Shrestha of Education Books. “The import of books went down for about two years. Then the pirates stepped in to fill the gap. It was about that time that pirated copies of biographies and memoirs of Obamas and Jai Shettys became omnipresent in the market.”Pirated copies of classics by Roald Dahl and JK Rowling also made an entry in the Nepali market. Then the phenomenon only saw a rise.Since the customs department does not levy duty on foreign books and also does not care to differentiate between the pirated and original copies, unauthorised books have found a safe haven in Nepali market.The government doesn’t levy any customs duty on books and newspapers published by foreign publishers abroad. The importers should only pay Rs565 at the customs points. But Nepali publishers have to pay 10 percent tax to import books printed in India.James Taylor, director of Communications and Freedom to Publish of the International Publishers Association, says that the government, publishers, writers and readers should join hands to control widespread piracy. “The government should realise that book publishing and reading culture contribute to the country’s economy as well,” he said, adding that the government should seize pirated books and close websites that sell pirated ebooks.Nandan Jha, executive vice chair of Penguin Random House India’s sales, production and business department, says that piracy has emerged as a big challenge for publishers of late and has harmed the authors, publishers, distributors, printers, readers and other stakeholders. “To confront piracy, all the stakeholders should launch a special joint effort,” Jha told the Post in an email exchange.Piracy has proliferated in the Nepali market to such an extent that the publishers of such books and unauthorised translations keep whatever ISBN numbers they like, often conflicting with other books, and still get off scot free. If scanned or searched on the internet, the ISBN number gives details on the author of the book, what the book is about, and its price, among others.Bijay Sharma, information officer at TU Library, says, “Keeping ISBN number at one’s will is illegal. If anyone files a complaint, we can punish them.”By the lawThe Muluki Ain-1910 BS had mandated that a publisher take permission of Gorkha Bhasa Prakashini Samiti before publishing any material. The Copyrights Act came into effect in 2022 BS and was amended in 2054 BS. In 2059 BS, a new Act was promulgated and it is still effective now. Authorities are currently working to amend the Act to give the registrar’s office more autonomy regarding copyright.According to the 2059 BS Act, copyright violations are considered government cases. In such cases, plaintiffs should file a complaint with the police. The Act’s clause 25 has various conditions that amount to violation of copyright. The Act’s subclause A says that if a publisher produces or copies material in writing or sound and sells or distributes it, it amounts to violation of copyright.Likewise, the Act’s clause 26 prevents selling of unauthorised material. The clause restricts the ‘importation of copies of work or sound recording, either made in a foreign country or sourced otherwise, into Nepal for business purpose shall not be permitted if preparation of such copies would be considered illegal if they were prepared in Nepal.’If anyone infringes upon protected rights, they are liable to punishment but the provision’s implementation remains lax.The law gives the authority to district court to take legal action against copyright violators.Advocate Parshuram Koirala says that if the government becomes more proactive, it can punish violators on the basis of the 2059 BS Act and thereby control the phenomenon of intellectual theft and copyright violations. “Creation is a crucial part of humanity’s benefit,” he says. “If intellectual property is not protected effectively, then there’d be no inspiration to create something.”Bal Bahadur Mukhiya, a professor at Nepal Law Campus, suggests the inclusion of rules about digital piracy in law, and also the clauses of various related international treaties and agreements that Nepal is part of.“In the US, a teacher or professor should pay a certain revenue even to photocopy a chapter of some text for teaching purposes,” Mukhiya says. “But in Nepal, those who photocopy an entire book and sell it go scot free.”(This report is prepared in collaboration with the Centre for Investigative Journalism, Nepal.) \nIn the past two weeks, the Federalism and Localisation Centre organised interactive programmes with chief ministers, ministers, political party leaders, principal secretaries and secretaries, and other key officials from Koshi, Madhesh, Bagmati and Gandaki provinces. Today, the Centre is organising a similar programme in Lumbini Province. This article summarises the key insights shared by the chief ministers during these discussions, focusing on three key areas: Provincial government achievements, challenges in federalism, and necessary reforms, including issues related to constitutional amendments.During a session in Pokhara, Chief Minister Surendra Raj Pandey stressed that the federal governance system cannot be effectively institutionalised without a significant shift in the mindset of political leaders. He recounted how he coordinated with then-Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal to convene a meeting of the National Coordination Council in July 2023, but lamented that the meeting yielded no meaningful outcomes. Although the meeting made six decisions to clarify the rights of all three tiers of government, Chief Minister Pandey pointed out that none have been fully implemented.According to him, while former Prime Minister Dahal was genuinely committed to federalism, many other leaders did not share the same dedication. Despite Dahal's commitment, the momentum for federalism stagnated during his tenure, as attempts were made to centralise power instead of promoting federalism. Pandey argued that it is unproductive to blame bureaucrats for the stagnation of federalism; rather, the real issue lies in a lack of political will. He mentioned that although the Madheshi and Maoist parties initially drove the federalism movement, political parties must now clearly articulate their stance if constitutional amendments are needed.Pandey asserted that provinces are the most crucial innovation of federalism, though opposition has emerged due to internal provincial issues and resource allocation. He stated, \"If we fail to deliver services, we must reassess our approach. Criticising us without the chance to perform is unfair. The federal government often does not pass necessary laws, yet we are held accountable.\" Engaging with nearly 100,000 people annually, he highlighted that this is a direct result of federalism. He called for a shift in political attitudes and expressed concern about provincial employees and police not being under provincial control, limiting governance potential.Chief Minister Hikmat Bahadur Karki of Koshi Province shared similar sentiments about the state of federalism in Nepal. He highlighted a concerning trend: Political leaders who once served at the provincial level often forget the challenges provinces face when transitioning to the federal government. \"Many who were once in the provinces during their first term are now at the federal level, but they seem to have forgotten the struggles and concerns of the provinces,\" Karki noted. He also addressed alarming calls to abolish federalism and eliminate provinces, attributing such views to a centralised mindset.Karki urged those drafting the constitution to take responsibility for its implementation, emphasising the need to prioritise federalism and constitutional reinforcement. He dismissed claims that integrating civil servants and police into the provincial system is impossible, warning that undermining federalism could lead to renewed conflict. \"If federalism is abolished, a new constitution may emerge, but it will only push Nepal towards further turmoil,\" Karki cautioned. Instead of dismantling the current federal structure, he advocated for addressing its flaws, noting that provinces operate with limited authority that must be expanded.Karki questioned the need for 25 federal ministries, suggesting that only essential ones like the Prime Minister’s Office, Finance, Defense, Home Affairs and Foreign Affairs should remain at the federal level. He criticised the disparity in resource allocation, noting that 80 percent of government employees are at the federal level, while the combined budgets of all seven provinces fall short of a single federal ministry's budget. To address this, he proposed a revenue-sharing model, with the federal government receiving 30 percent of revenue and provinces and local governments each receiving 35 percent. Karki expressed dissatisfaction with the Fiscal Commission's performance, stating it has not followed the constitutional spirit. He also highlighted the challenges of administrative federalism, where many civil servants resist transfers. Despite these issues, Karki acknowledged progress in infrastructure development but lamented the lack of communication and advocacy for federalism. In Madhesh Province, there is a growing recognition that meaningful federalism can only be realised if the federal government allows provinces to exercise the rights guaranteed by the constitution. Concerns have been raised about the federal government's reluctance to grant constitutional rights to provincial governments under various pretexts, hindering the institutionalisation of federalism.During a dialogue on strengthening federalism held in Janakpur, Chief Minister Satish Kumar Singh highlighted positive developments in sectors such as education, health and infrastructure since the establishment of federalism. He cited these advancements as having significantly transformed the rural landscape of Madhesh, underscoring the tangible benefits of provincial governance.Despite limited rights and resources, Singh highlighted the provincial government’s commitment to establishing essential infrastructure and mechanisms for the benefit of the people. He noted that the effective roles played by provincial and local governments during the Covid-19 pandemic were crucial in saving countless lives. Singh cautioned that relying solely on the federal government during such crises would have led to dire consequences, further reinforcing the importance and relevance of federalism.While acknowledging that the rights granted to provinces are insufficient, Singh said that the provincial government has shown its presence by undertaking necessary tasks even in areas beyond its jurisdiction. For instance, despite lacking authority over basic education, the provincial government has initiated school infrastructure development. He highlighted the critical issue of the teacher-student ratio in Madhesh Province, where one teacher serves 40 to 45 students, compared to the standard of one for every 20 to 22 in the hills, raising concerns about education quality.Singh noted that 80 percent of government employees are concentrated in Singha Durbar, fostering a perception that provincial workers are penalised. He criticised the federal government's maintenance of 25 ministries, arguing that only five to seven are necessary, especially with existing provincial ministries. Singh stressed the importance of addressing flawed practices while advocating for provincial rights. He warned that if actions undermine the future of federalism, Madhesh Province would not remain silent. Calling for unity among political parties against attempts to weaken federalism, he emphasised that collaborative efforts are essential for strengthening governance in Nepal.Chief Minister Bahadur Singh Lama of Bagmati Province expressed serious concerns about the ongoing challenges the provincial government faces, particularly due to the lack of control over police administration. He underscored that a government without effective police oversight is fundamentally flawed. \"While a government may exist, its significance diminishes without a functional police administration,\" he stated.The relationship between the federal and provincial governments has been strained for some time, especially regarding police integration and civil service legislation. In light of these challenges, Bagmati Province has proactively constructed police facilities and established relevant laws. However, unresolved issues surrounding police integration continue to hinder effective governance. He acknowledged that while some changes have occurred since the implementation of federalism, they do not align with citizens' expectations. \"The hopes and desires of the people are substantial; however, managing these aspirations with current resources presents significant challenges,\" he explained. Chief Minister Lama assured attendees that the provincial government is prioritising issues outlined in the list of exclusive rights mandated by the constitution, stating, \"To date, we have enacted 80 laws that address the needs of our province.\"Lama emphasised the urgent need for improved coordination among provincial, federal, and local governments, identifying this as a primary challenge. \"Developing the necessary laws to facilitate effective collaboration among the three tiers of government is essential. Failure to do so will lead to public dissatisfaction.\"The insights shared by the chief ministers highlight the urgent need for reforms in Nepal's federal system. While progress has been made, significant challenges remain. \nFollowing remarkable development gains, Nepal stands at a crossroads in its journey towards inclusive, green growth and sustainable development. It must chart a path through multiple, linked challenges. Health, economic, climate and social fragility, alongside rapidly changing opportunities, demand that it adapts. But the future is unpredictable. Making Nepal's development choices requires frank, inclusive and challenging conversations. It requires local knowledge and collective experience. Decisions must be based on the best available evidence and, where necessary, challenge the status quo. As Nepal’s oldest partner—with over two centuries of shared history—the United Kingdom remains committed to this journey. Together, we are exploring how to navigate future development challenges. In that spirit, we’re launching a series of expert discussions—the “Horizons Dialogue Series”—to provide an inclusive space for dynamic conversations on Nepal’s development pathway, drawing on Nepali and international expertise. Nepal’s development journey is complex. Space for forward-thinking and innovative solutions, grounded in credible data and local insights is vital. Testing assumptions and examining the many faces of fragility matter. These dialogues offer an opportunity for those committed to transformational change in Nepal to come together in a conversation informed by evidence. To delve into Nepal’s future economy, demographics, migration, climate, and nature. The first dialogue, Navigating Nepal’s Fragility, will focus on how health, economic, and climate challenges interact. Overlapping shocks lie at the heart of Nepal's ability to anticipate and respond to crises. Drawing on local voices and expert insights, this shared approach will consider what might happen in the next five to ten years. It will help examine the inequalities that leave some groups more vulnerable than others. For many women, lower-income families, and marginalised groups, health crises, economic downturns, and environmental disasters have a more devastating impact. This reality makes tackling the intersection of vulnerabilities essential to greater resilience. External shocks that compound one another present risks to Nepal’s economy. Remittances and tourism have long been critical to the country's economic landscape. But their volatility during crises exposes vulnerability. Exploring how Nepal can foster an economy that is more sustainable and better prepared for future disruptions matters. As does considering how governance structures, social protection systems and local initiatives can leverage inclusive growth. For many Nepalis, especially those in rural and marginalised communities, access to resources, healthcare, and job opportunities remains unequal. Addressing these disparities will create an economy that benefits everyone. Air pollution—a growing concern—is closely tied to the climate-health nexus. It disproportionately affects vulnerable populations. Twelve percent of Kathmandu’s population suffers from chronic health conditions linked to the rising pollution levels from industrial emissions, reliance on biomass and dated transport infrastructure. While economic and health challenges may be better known, climate change is a looming backdrop to Nepal’s development choices. Shifting weather patterns, melting glaciers, and environmental degradation affect the economy, food and nutrition, water security, increasing pressure on vulnerable populations. For rural farmers, these disruptions can mean the difference between survival and destitution. The risks posed by glacial lake floods, such as those recently witnessed in Thame and Mustang, highlight the immediate threats to life in the Himalayas. The United Nations Secretary-General’s visit to Everest underscored Nepal’s vulnerability, with his message from the \"roof of the world\" calling for urgent global action on climate change. As Nepal grapples with these challenges, climate resilience must be at the core of any long-term development strategy. The Horizons dialogues will also explore how nature conservation, sustainable land use and biodiversity protection can be integrated into Nepal’s broader development goals. Safeguarding the country’s rich natural resources will ensure both economic, social and ecological stability. At the heart of these discussions is the need for strong, adaptable institutions capable of managing contemporary social and economic challenges across the country. Transparent, accountable governance will ensure resources are used efficiently and development efforts are inclusive. Nepal’s institutions must be able to respond to immediate crises while remaining flexible enough to address longer-term shifts. The dialogues will reflect on how Nepal’s governance structures can be resilient and drive development outcomes that are shared equitably. Migration and demographic changes will be the focus of the next dialogue. Migration, both internal and international, is driving rapid economic and social change in Nepal. Demographic shifts, including youth migration from rural to urban areas and overseas, is reshaping labour markets and infrastructure needs. Understanding these trends will be crucial to chart Nepal’s development journey over the next decade. Nepal’s ability to adapt, respond to crises and achieve sustainable growth requires agility and recognition of local realities. Reflecting this, in February 2024, the UK launched a refreshed development portfolio in Nepal. This new portfolio recognises the interconnected nature of Nepal’s challenges and opportunities. It includes support for climate adaptation, anticipatory action on disasters and efforts to protect the most vulnerable while ensuring access to health, education and other basic social services. We’ll also help local governments build climate-resilient infrastructure based on local needs and work to promote investment, good jobs, and clean growth. Nepal’s development journey in a rapidly changing world is filled with both opportunities and uncertainties. Working with Nepal’s leaders, experts and local voices, the UK hopes the Horizons Dialogues will help create space for critical reflection between Nepal and its friends. It will help us—together—consider innovative solutions that respond to Nepal’s future needs. It will bring together diverse perspectives on the future, blending the expertise of Nepali policymakers and development experts, with partners such as the UK’s Durham University and international collaborators, integrating the lived experiences of Nepal’s communities. As these conversations unfold, they will help chart a path forward—one grounded in local realities, informed by credible data, and focused on creating a resilient and equitable future for all.  \nIn the run-up to Constitution Day (Asoj 3), the government is preparing to partially open the historic Dharahara Tower to the public. Major parties are planning their own events to mark the special day. At the same time, tension is growing as those opposed to the 2015 Constitution of the Federal Democratic Republic of Nepal secretly plan to create a disturbance on the streets of the capital city.Some activists are openly preaching their intention to eventually turn Nepal into another Bangladesh and drive party rulers out of the country like Sheikh Hasina. Of course, this dream is impossible and not in the national interest. Yet the government anticipates a significant confrontation with the protestors that day—probably comprising Madheshi groups, monarchists like the Rastriya Prajatantra Party and anti-corruption activists. I advise restraint from the perspective of Dalits, Janajatis and other marginalised groups. We must indeed come out in large numbers and demonstrate to demand appropriate statute reforms and vent our anger at the authorities for ignoring our major causes. But we should peacefully protest to not aid and abet monarchists and others who want to reverse this constitution's great achievements. We cannot afford to lose some of the constitution's gems, such as republicanism, secularism, proportional representation, inclusion, human rights, press freedom and the rights and privileges accorded to historically oppressed castes and communities. Our demand should be to get more rights and to force the state to implement those provisions. Do we want the monarchy back?The simple answer is no. Republicanism is one of the significant sources of contention against this constitution among some people, but it’s almost impossible to resurrect the Hindu monarchy in today’s Nepal. The call for restoring the deposed King may appear increasingly louder in the media, also because many of the proponents of this idea belong to the high-caste elite groups. The ground realities, however, paint a different picture. A look into the country’s demography alone is sufficient to understand why the monarch's return is impossible today. Understandably, few Dalits, ethnic nationalities, Madheshis, Muslims, Christian converts, etc., support the monarchy. The majority of this population has suffered a great deal under the dictatorship of the Hindu king through the centuries. One shouldn’t be confused by a few individuals like Rajendra Lingden, who leads a highly conservative Hindu monarchist party, the RPP. Some people are frustrated with growing immorality, dishonesty, corruption and poor delivery of the party leadership and may assume that the monarchy was better. Why not have just one king with the crown rather than several kings sans the crown? But history suggests otherwise.Monarchy is responsible for Nepal's status as one of the poorest nations. Kings didn’t develop Nepal as much as they could have, not least in the second half of the 20th century, when many nations, mainly those in East Asia, became tremendously rich and powerful. The Shah kings did nothing substantial to promote the rights and identities of the marginalised communities. Instead, they persistently dominated them. All they did was strengthen the Hindu caste hierarchy, greatly impeding national progress and development, as anthropologist Dor Bahadur Bista famously argued in Fatalism and Development. It’s thus important to understand that republicanism is not the real issue here; Brahmanism is the mother of our current ills. After the termination of the Hindu monarchy, the power and influence of the second-tier Chhetri and Thakuri, too, have eroded rapidly. Forget about distributing power to the lower ranks. Hill Brahmins or Bahuns have virtually monopolised all state sectors, including political power and juridical and military authority. Indeed, they are always in charge of the religious realm. Constitutional reformWe must focus not on dismantling the 2015 constitution, returning it to its 1990 form by reviving monarchy as monarchists have demanded—but on reforming it to reflect current realities. There must be ways to ensure, for example, that leaders cannot exploit the provisions of Article 76 to frequently change governments. We must ensure that no individual, family, clan, caste or community can monopolise power for as long as is happening now. Solid constitutional provisions should also be made to ensure that political parties operate more democratically and transparently and that party leaders are held accountable for their actions. Importantly, changes should reduce financial and other forms of corruption and/or misuse of authority at the highest level.One way to do so would be to find ways to prevent the use of large sums of money to contest elections. When officials are forced to invest massive amounts simply to get elected, they will naturally be forced to use every possible means to return that money. This is a significant driver of widespread corruption and other power misuse. The fully proportional electoral system is often touted as the best way out of the vortex of corruption. Still, more careful considerations are required to find the most suitable way forward. Likewise, critical constitutional reforms are required to protect and promote the rights and privileges of the many disgruntled groups nationwide. There’s a severe need to make all organs of the state sensitive to the suffering of Dalits and other suppressed communities.Promoting Dalit freedom Party leaders have cheated Dalits by declaring Nepal a state free from untouchability and making provisions to safeguard their rights and uplift them socially and economically but not enforcing the constitutional and legal requirements. They spend significant amounts to make villages free from open-air toilets. Not a penny has been spent to realise the dream of a society free from caste discrimination, however.High-caste politicians have effectively copied King Mahendra's strategy. The latter made constitutional changes in 2020 BS to apparently end caste discrimination, but they permitted and preserved it by stating that religious and cultural beliefs and practices should be respected. I’d urge the Nepali Government and Parliament to add a provision in the constitution to amend religious and cultural beliefs and traditions to eradicate caste discrimination. Much of the caste-based humiliation, hatred and violence emanates from Manusmriti, Parasarsmiriti and Garud Purana and many other Hindu texts. Traditional shamanic and tantric traditions, too, are laden with systems of caste exclusion and separation.  \nIt is no secret that we are taking in chemicals-laced fruits and vegetables into our kitchens and bodies. But the Nepali government reports progress, suggesting most of the food we consume might be safe. Last year, the Department of Food Technology and Quality Control tested over 63,000 samples and found only 37 of them positive for pesticides. A similar report from the Central Agriculture Laboratory indicated that 8,503 of 8,575 samples tested for carbamate and organophosphate pesticide residues were safe for consumption.These reports are far from comforting, as they include tests only for a limited number of pesticides. In reality, pesticide imports have more than doubled in the past five years in Nepal, from 169,360 kilograms in 2017-18 to 354,358 kilograms in 2022-23. According to Kantipur, a sister publication of this paper, nine kinds of pesticides are registered in Nepal. Among them, seven kinds are imported. While hundreds of pesticides fall under these groups, only two—residues of insecticide from the carbamate and organophosphate—are tested in the government’s laboratory. The rest are left untested and unregulated. Such negligence from the authorities and from farmers who knowingly or unknowingly use insecticides and pesticides has endangered people’s lives. Heavy use of pesticides leads to severe health problems. The living examples of this are the residents of Gorkha Gandaki Rural Municipality in Gandaki Province. Sixty-one people in the place are fighting cancer, and 15 more are suffering from kidney failure. People in other districts are also struggling with the immediate health effects of pesticides (dizziness, tiredness, heart attack, vomiting, headache, among others) as well as long-term effects (cancer, retarded body growth, inborn disability, etc.). The state cannot shun its responsibility to protect the lives of its citizens; the right to health is their fundamental right, too. There have been measures like declaring Karnali as an “organic province” six years ago. Yet, chemical fertilisers banned, farmers in the province were given no alternatives like organic compost and plant fertilisers to grow enough healthy crops and vegetables. Nor were there laboratories and manpower to test if the foods being produced were really organic. As yields dwindled, people became even more dependent on chemical-laden foods imported from India. The organic project, which could have been a model for the country, was instead a dismal failure. If the use of pesticides continues, a nationwide public health crisis is not far off. The examination of foods for the heck of it must stop. If the authorities really want to work in favour of consumers, they must test for a wider range of pesticides in the food imported via the open border. There must also be more labs to test these products in local units. As important is allocating more technicians for this work, which even our few laboratories lack. All these measures seem a little too much to ask but they are all worth pursuing in the long run. At stake are the health and wellbeing of millions of Nepali. Experts also highlight the lack of knowledge and awareness among farmers about the use of pesticides—and local levels can play a key role in making them aware of their downsides. The more we educate them, the better we control the use of chemicals. \nFormer Deputy Prime Minister and Home Minister and current chair of the Rastriya Swatantra Party Rabi Lamichhane has desperately tried to evade responsibility for his role in the misappropriation of cooperatives funds. Yet the mounting pile of evidence suggests his clear culpability. The parliamentary special probe committee was specifically formed to look into his involvement in the siphoning of money from various cooperatives into the Gorkha Media Network, of which he was the Managing Director. If the feelers coming from the committee members are any sign, Lamichhane will be held accountable for his crime. Yet corruption in Nepal is not limited to Lamichhane or his party. If Lamichhane deserves to be investigated and, if found guilty, punished, so should members of any other political party, irrespective of the positions they occupy. Credible evidence has emerged of the involvement of Dhan Raj Gurung, the Nepali Congress Vice-president, in the embezzlement of funds from a Lalitpur-based cooperative. Gurung reportedly helped his ex-wife, Joyti Gurung, embezzle around Rs12.5 million. Similarly, there are accusations that Risikesh Pokharel, the CPN-UML leader who is also the chair of Parliament’s Public Accounts Committee also helped his wife, Anjala Koirala, embezzle as much as Rs120 million from a Morang-based cooperative. What is interesting about the cases against the senior Congress and the UML leaders is the state’s apparent collusion in shielding the two. For instance, the operators of Miteri Savings and Loan Cooperative had filed complaints against 11 people, including Gurung, for misappropriating funds. But the Bagmati Province government has excluded his name in the list of the possible culprits it has sent to the Central Bureau of Investigation of Nepal Police. (The province has Bahadur Singh Lama of the Congress as its chief minister.) Likewise, the Cooperative Registrar Office of the Koshi Province has excluded the name of Anjala Koirala in the list it has forwarded to the police. This is even though the victims of the cooperative had flagged her as one of the operators involved in fund embezzlement. (Koshi province has Hikmat Kumar Karki of the UML as its chief minister.) How seemingly the whole state apparatus is being employed to shield the political leaders from the two ruling parties is shocking. No wonder the government is facing allegations of bias and vindictiveness. On Saturday, Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli spent much time fulminating against the Maoist Centre, new political forces, the royalists of various hues as well as Kathmandu's mayor. Yet there was little in terms of introspection. How does he expect people to take either him or his government seriously when it is seen as protecting the corrupt and the compromised people? Rather than making big promises, Oli and his government would be better served if they are seen to be fairly applying the rule of the land and working in public interest. The cooperatives crisis is assuming alarming proportions. It has the potential to do serious damage to the national economy—besides adding untold miseries to hundreds of thousands of poor cooperatives victims who stand to lose everything if prompt measures are not taken to bring fraudulent cooperatives operators to book. If the Oli government plays with the cooperatives’ fire, it could find itself engulfed in the inferno.  \nChild drowning has become a common occurrence in Nepal’s Madhesh Province. We are only a few months into this fiscal year, and 49 people, 39 of them children, have needlessly lost their lives in ponds, fish ponds and rain-filled pits. These incidents, unfortunately, are likely to escalate this year as the number of deaths by drowning has steadily inched up in the past few years. The figure, which was 81 in FY 2022-23, rose to 124 in FY 2023-24. This necessitates immediate preventive measures from households and governments.But what is more alarming is that these preventable deaths are not a priority for government officials. A recent Post report highlights this glaring negligence, as deaths by drowning haven’t been included in disaster preparedness programmes in any of the 136 local units of the province. Instead of addressing the issue head-on, they are busy passing the blame and pointing to the parents’ supposed negligence for failing to attend to their children. This has, in turn, added to the woes of the bereaved families.The World Health Organization has listed many ways to prevent drowning, including covering wells and fencing swimming pools. It also recommends providing childcare for pre-school children and teaching school-age children basic swimming. Conducting safe rescue skills training with safety measures is another requirement. However, these preventive measures are rare in Nepal’s local units. In Chhinnamasta Rural Municipality in Spatari, authorities rely on a simple awareness campaign to mitigate the risks of drowning—a crucial but insufficient measure when it comes to saving lives.Countries around the world, despite witnessing deaths through drowning, only recognised World Drowning Prevention Day in 2021. Nepal followed suit in 2023. With late recognition of this problem, devising plans, policies and programmes to prevent drowning incidents are in a nascent stage, and many local units are largely unequipped. However, recognition alone is not enough; authorities should at least be mindful of the goings-on in their localities. The first order of business should thus be for local authorities to include this life-threatening incident in disaster preparedness projects, focus on fencing ponds and pools, initiate programmes to cover wells and to mandate construction workers to cover construction pits. Concomitantly, practical measures like training locals to rescue and monitor the pond/water source areas are vital. Likewise, parents and children should be educated in households about the dangers of drowning; school-going children need to be taught about water safety through school curriculum. Children under five drown even in bucket water, quickly and silently and, therefore, deserve special attention. Every child has the right to protection from harm.The provincial and federal governments must heed this problem and launch mass awareness campaigns. Of all child mortality under five, drowning accounts for 2.8 percent deaths in Nepal. The WHO’s preventive measures to upskill people in rescue activities and train school-age children could be beneficial in mitigating the risk, but these programmes need big financial commitments and human resources. Federal and provincial governments can help local governments by coordinating with international aid agencies. It is incumbent on local representatives to work on this problem wholeheartedly rather than merely brushing off the issue by blaming others. Everyone should work together to put a lid on it. \nNepal is marking its ninth Constitution Day on Thursday. The country’s two largest parties—the Nepali Congress and the CPN-UML—formed a coalition government a month ago with a commitment to reviewing and amending the constitution. In this context, Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal and Binod Ghimire sat down with constitutional expert Purna Man Shakya to discuss the good and bad aspects of the constitution amendment process.The Congress and the UML have floated a proposal to amend the constitution. Is the time ripe to make changes in our statute?Generally, constitutions are reviewed after around a decade of their implementation. So, we have come to the stage of reviewing whether our constitution has functioned properly. However, the sudden announcement of the amendment is premature, as this is a serious business. In our case, the constitution can’t be amended just based on the interest of one or two parties. It requires a national consensus. There should be an understanding among the political parties represented in Parliament. And, a sort of consensus even among the people’s level is important as there was huge public involvement in making this constitution. Sentiment of various communities must be respected while making any changes in the national charter. What can be the modality of seeking consensus at the people’s level? Should a draft be prepared and opened up for debate?While making changes in the constitution, some issues might be technical and not of interest to common people. But if any changes are made in policy issues that can alter our country’s structural dynamics, the concerned communities must be consulted. Just the present strength of the political parties represented in Parliament is no guarantee that they truly represent people. For instance, the Maoists emerged as the largest party through the election in 2008. But it has been shrunk to a distant third in the House. However, we can’t conclude from this that the people have discarded the party’s agenda. The Maoists might have been discredited due to their activities and failure in delivery but people might still favour the agenda they once championed. Similar is the case with other parties. Therefore, we have to consider broader consensus both in Parliament as well as the people’s level.How challenging is it to enter the constitution amendment process?Any amendment calls for a two-thirds majority in the House of Representatives as well as the National Assembly in the federal parliament. If an issue is linked to provincial authority, it should be endorsed by the majority [four] of seven provinces. So, this is not easy. Therefore, the parties should tread carefully.You mentioned earlier that constitution amendments without a review process is not a right step. Could you elaborate?The right way is to first have broad understanding among the top leaders of political forces on the issues and then constitute a panel of experts to conduct a comprehensive study on that. Such studies are conducted through two methods—doctrinal and non-doctrinal. The doctrinal method analyses related literature and principles on theoretical approach while the non-doctrinal method studies the public sentiments and opinions through surveys and interactions, and comes up with certain methodologies with the help of subject experts. Through such study, the experts identify the issues and recommend the ways to the politicians. This is the right process.There are also arguments that reviewing the constitution without even bringing it into full-fledged implementation is wrong. Based on the practice during these years, we have concluded that certain provisions didn’t work properly. It is true that we are talking about making changes in the constitution without even implementing certain provisions. First we have to give the system an opportunity to work in a full-fledged way. Then, we can evaluate whether it worked. Any move to dissolve the system without properly implementing it will create divisions and invite another conflict. A question that is often asked: Is there a problem with our constitution or with our politicians? People can change the constitution but the constitution can’t change the people. Therefore, a constitution should be developed also on the basis of the nature of people in the country who use it. If our political parties and the politicians had reformed themselves, we might not have had to discuss constitutional changes time and again. We should have made the system strong for more effective checks and balances and made leaders and officials more accountable. The ruling parties reason that the constitution amendment became necessary to ensure political stability.When a federal government is changed, its aftershocks are immediately seen in all seven provincial governments. It directly impacts development and other activities across the country. It’s a flaw in our party system but we have to find a solution in the system. We see people raising voices for two things—stability and retirement of old politicians. As Nepali politicians never retire voluntarily, we have to address it through the system. Direct election of executive head can be one way to address this problem. People have found local governments more effective than federal and provincial governments. It is because chiefs and representatives of local governments are directly elected and they can serve the full five-year term.Once people are given the right to elect heads of government, they won’t elect old faces such as KP Oli, Sher Bahadur Deuba and Prachanda [Pushpa Kamal Dahal], who have been tested multiple times. It will serve two purposes—first, it gives stability and second, it allows popular leaders to emerge in place of the old ones. The old leaders have maintained control over national politics through their huge party organisations. But when people directly elect presidents and chief ministers their grip over party organisations can’t be decisive in national politics. For that we have to amend the constitution.However, again, an expert team needs to thoroughly study the pros and cons of such changes. But what I can say based on the general study of public perception is that we can first go for direct election of executive heads at the provincial level. In the next phase we can go for direct presidential election at the federal level.What went wrong in the practice of the three-tier federal system?While adopting federalism, the basic idea was to allow the local governments to oversee local matters while the provincial governments would handle wide ranges of issues related to agriculture, industry, forest, education and health, etcetera. If the two sub-national governments handle these things, people don’t need to come to the centre seeking solutions to their problems. In such a scenario, the federal government can focus on important affairs such as foreign relations, defence, telecommunication, currency, national infrastructure projects and inter-provincial affairs. Such division of powers would automatically create specialisation in the respective governments.But the federal system is not implemented as per that spirit. Provinces aren’t allowed to exercise their rights. People are still travelling to Kathmandu all the way from remote districts even for basic things. The constitution has mandated the provinces to maintain law and order in their respective provinces but the federal government hasn’t allowed them to have their own police forces. Provinces without police have become like administrative units. The centre has a huge bureaucracy in Kathmandu. It is high time that the centre delegates authority to provinces as per the constitutional spirit. Federal lawmakers have huge interest in local development activities because it is directly related to their election. They don’t want to lose this influence. The interest of federal lawmakers however contradicts with the constitution.There is also a belief that the local level has authority in areas where they can’t work effectively, for instance they are mandated to oversee the education system up to grade 12 while provinces don’t have much role. Do you think such jurisdictional matters need to be reviewed and provinces should be given more authority?That’s right. First of all, we should be clear that there is no point in adopting a federal system if we don’t want provinces because we had central and local levels even in the past. Provincial layer is an integral part of federalism. So, we have to think about transferring certain rights from local to provincial level because the local units don’t have expertise to oversee education up to grade 12 on their own. Our local units are traditionally trained in local development activities. But now they are entrusted with the responsibility of not only overseeing education and health issues but also with legislative and judicial functions. They haven’t been able to play that role. We should think about transferring some roles from local to provincial levels. Likewise, the centre should be ready to allow the provinces to exercise their rights bestowed by the constitution. It is time to strengthen the provinces.You said direct election of executive heads in provinces could end instability at the provincial level. But what if a popular leader got elected chief minister but other political parties won majority seats in the provincial assemblies? In such a situation, the rival parties may not help the chief minister pass a budget or policies from the assembly.Yes, there are strengths and weaknesses of all systems. Such problems can be resolved because we see similar situations in other countries as well. Parties can’t prolong the deadlock in the House because they will be blamed for the impasse. One basis is that our local units are doing well under executive heads. So, we can practise it for a decade in the provinces and then apply it to the federal level based on that experience.Many forces and groups that aren’t happy with the present constitution, which was basically a compromise document. Once the constitution amendment process is open, they are certain to revive their demands. Will the situation be manageable?If the rights of historically marginalised communities are curtailed, they will certainly retaliate. If you try to go against the federal republic system and policy of inclusion, it may invite new conflicts. The proportional representation system is not a problem. Leaders made it unpopular by misusing it. We should find solutions to stop its misuse. We shouldn’t forget that this constitution is not only a constitution but also a key document of our peace process. This is not perfect but it was essential to end the conflict. Many say that while making a document of compromise, our constitution hasn’t followed the principles of constitutionalism. For instance, the hearing system is something unusual in a parliamentary system. As a constitutional expert, do you think we should also think about fixing such deviations?You are right. When we couldn’t change the people, we tried to add additional features as a measure to check the wrongdoings. Our leaders make appointments in key constitutional bodies guided by their personal and partisan interests. We copied the hearing practice from the presidential system with a view to check the leaders’ arbitrary appointments. It hasn’t been that effective. Therefore, we have proposed to give continuity to the hearing for political appointments but not in the appointments of judges because lawmakers don’t have the expertise to examine judges’ competence. Since lawmakers are mainly guided by the party’s whip and top leaders’ instructions, it rather increases political interference even in the judiciary. We have thus proposed to stop the hearing process for judges’ appointments.Many say that the judiciary hasn’t been federalized even though all other sectors have been restructured as per the three-tier federal system. Why this exception for the judiciary?Oh, you dragged me to a sensitive topic. One thing we shouldn’t forget is that we adopted a federal system not to unify small countries. We were already a united country. We adopted it to better manage our social diversity by involving all the communities in the governing system. We at the same time have to safeguard the country from disintegration. Judiciary, the national army and Nepali language are our institutional arrangements that can play a unifying role. Therefore, we didn’t make much changes in these three aspects.Some instances show that Nepal’s federalism might have been a bit more effective had the judiciary worked proactively. For instance, the court hasn’t decided even the cases filed by provinces years ago. What do you think about the judiciary’s role in this connection?Yes, those cases are still undecided. In the Constituent Assembly, the Maoist party had registered a proposal to form a separate constitutional court. The justices who were leading the judiciary at the time opposed the idea. It was later rejected. Then the idea to have a separate constitutional bench was included as a compromise deal. But it has failed to work effectively. It failed to decide election-related disputes. We have to review its jurisdiction. They have decided certain cases when there is public pressure. For instance they decided cases like House dissolution because there was constant public scrutiny. But they haven’t shown any interest in other important cases where constitutional interpretation is needed. Of late, a strong opinion is being built in favour of forming a separate constitutional court. These issues are being discussed seriously. This issue may emerge if the constitution amendment process begins.What we can infer from your analysis is that the constitution amendment process is not that easy. What are the basic things that should be and can be done in the constitution amendment at this stage?First, we should change the form of governance at the provincial level and go for a directly elected executive head. With this there will be no change in government in provinces after changes at the centre. The governments in provinces can work for five years with certainty. Second, we can transfer the powers that the local units have failed to exercise to provinces. And, the centre should allow the provinces to exercise the concurrent rights. By doing this the centre can reduce the overwhelming burden on it. While the provinces can play an implementing role, the federation can play a supervisory role. These things need to be fixed. We need some amendments to the constitution and some new laws for this. \nNepal has often earned global recognition for its progressive policies and inclusive stance on LGBTQIA+ rights. But do the global accolades Nepal has earned in terms of its progressiveness reflect the actual experiences of queer people here? The Post’s Aarati Ray sat down with Manisha Dhakal, executive director of the Blue Diamond Society and a leading advocate for LGBTQIA+ rights in South Asia for over 23 years.Nepal is often hailed for its progressive stance on queer rights, both in South Asia and globally. With over two decades of queer rights advocacy, how accurate do you find this portrayal?Many activists and commentators do describe Nepal as being progressive on queer rights. While this is partly true, especially when we consider the legal frameworks, the reality at the grassroots is quite different. On the one hand, Nepal’s constitution recognises LGBTQIA+ identities. Articles 12 and 18 mandate that “gender identity” be acknowledged on citizenship certificates, while Article 42 promises affirmative action and participation in government for sexual and gender minorities. Court decisions in Nepal, too, have been favourable for LGBTQIA+ rights, and unlike many former British colonies with Section 377-type laws that criminalise queer communities, Nepal has no such legal barriers. So, indeed, there are opportunities for activism, and progress has been made, particularly in terms of legal recognition. But, again, the rights enshrined in the constitution and affirmed by the courts have not been realised at the grassroots level. We are stuck with a limited focus, primarily on citizenship. The state claims that we’ve been given the right to identity and legal recognition, but even this is not fully realised. For example, the process of obtaining citizenship based on self-identification remains difficult, with government officials still unclear on how to implement these provisions. The broader narrative of Nepal being progressive is built on a superficial understanding of the situation.In August, Nepal’s Supreme Court ruled that Rukshana Kapali, a transgender woman, should be legally recognised as a woman on all documents without medical verification. How does this decision impact the future of LGBTQIA+ rights in Nepal?Rukshana’s case is a prominent victory, highlighting the judiciary’s support for LGBTQIA+ rights, especially compared to those of the executive and legislative branches. This ruling lays a strong foundation for similar future cases and will undoubtedly help in future activism. However, it’s important to note that the decision applies only to Kapali, meaning others will still need to go through the courts to have their gender identity legally recognised. How long must transgender individuals continue to endure lengthy court processes just to obtain citizenship?Even outside the courts, the bureaucratic hurdles—from medical reassignment surgeries to invasive checkups and long delays from the CDO (District Administration Office) to the Ministry of Home Affairs—can take years, with no guarantee of getting preferred names on legal documents. In many cases, even after completing the process, the names are inaccurately changed, such as altering Ram to Rama instead of the preferred name, like Manisha.We [Blue Diamond Society] get 15-20 complaints each year, primarily from transgender women, regarding difficulties in obtaining citizenship.The Supreme Court’s recent decision on same-sex marriage in Nepal has attracted global attention and gotten a positive response. Are there any limits to the court’s decision?After a long and arduous process, we secured temporary registration for same-sex marriages. On June 28, 2023, the Supreme Court, in the Pinky Gurung vs. Government of Nepal case, issued an interim order instructing the government to temporarily register same-sex marriages, including for those with “other” gender markers. That said, the Civil Code adopted in 2017 still defines marriage as a union between a ‘man’ and a ‘woman’.We, as a community, are pleased with the government’s temporary registration process. Yet it falls short of offering full marriage rights, including those related to property, adoption, and tax exemptions. While the court’s decision sets a supportive precedent, lack of clarity about the rights associated with the temporary certificate leaves many in limbo. So far, only around five couples have registered, and many in the community are hesitant to do so.The question remains: Can this temporary registration truly grant us the same recognition as heterosexual marriages? While the decision has garnered global praise, the LGBTQIA+ community on the ground continues to feel cheated of true equality. Our ultimate goal is to amend the Civil Code so that marriage is defined as a union between two individuals, rather than being restricted to one between male and female.Why do many court decisions on queer rights in Nepal, like of same-sex marriages, remain in limbo? Is this due to the government and courts trying to appease both conservative and progressive groups, or is it just a performative gesture of inclusivity?There are multiple factors at play. I think some responsibility also falls on activists. For example, when fighting for legal recognition since 2008, we should have advocated not only for the “third gender” or “other” but also for individuals who have transitioned from male to female or female to male. What’s more, policymakers and bureaucrats still lack awareness about human rights principles related to minority groups like the LGBTQIA+ community. Even though Nepal has ratified international conventions on human rights, these commitments have not been prioritised by lawmakers, which leads to this state of limbo and half-hearted inclusivity.As for the internal thought processes of bureaucrats and lawmakers, it’s hard to say. Many of them might still believe that the LGBTQIA+ community shouldn’t be granted full rights, so they engage in performative actions—appearing supportive on the surface to attract global attention but hesitating to fully advance our rights. This could explain why progress seems to stall midway.Queer rights have received some legal recognition. But how are they reflected in terms of social and cultural acceptance in Nepal?Legal changes and social acceptance need to go hand in hand. If we only focus on legal reforms without addressing societal attitudes, there will be no real change. We’ve seen this play out—there is legal recognition of gender identity, and temporary registration for same-sex marriage is available. Yet people struggle to fully realise these rights because of deep-rooted discrimination within families and society.In Nepal, a socially and culturally driven society, where family, relatives, and festivals play a major role, social acceptance is often more important than legal acceptance. When it comes to cultural acceptance, biases still persist. For example, it feels like we’re allowed to express ourselves openly only during the Pride Month in June. When we try to participate in other celebrations like Teej or Gaijatra, society often reacts negatively, asking why we need to “spoil” their festivals. This shows that social change is still lagging, despite the progress in legal rights.You mentioned that the queer community is often given the surface level of legal recognition. How is the state of the exercise of fundamental rights for LGBTQIA+ people in Nepal?Labelled as ‘gender and sexual minorities’, our broader struggles are ignored. When we raise concerns about poverty, food insecurity, or unemployment, the response we often get from government institutions and stakeholders is, “This isn’t our issue; it’s a gender problem.”We are just as much a part of society as anyone else. Issues like climate change, housing, and poverty affect us too. We want to be included in solutions, whether it’s participating in climate programs or being involved in community initiatives. Unfortunately, lawmakers and stakeholders often overlook that we are just as human as heterosexuals, with needs that go beyond legal recognition on paper.What are some aspects of the queer community that have not received enough attention in media narratives, and what tends to be unnecessarily highlighted?As I’ve mentioned before, the narrative surrounding our community often focuses heavily on issues like citizenship, while overlooking other important aspects of our lives. What’s missing is the correct representation of our contributions in various fields. Many LGBTQIA+ individuals are doctors, and experts in different professions, yet their accomplishments are only rarely acknowledged or represented. Instead, the focus often falls on the unfortunate image of some members of the community begging on the streets, which goes viral on social media.Another issue is the way we are predominantly associated with sex and sexuality. While these are important aspects of human identity, we are much more than that. We have other needs and rights that deserve attention. Unfortunately, the media tends to fixate on sexual aspects of the LGBTQIA+ community, reinforcing stereotypes. It’s time for the media to move beyond this narrow portrayal and include us in broader discussions that reflect the full scope of our lives.How has the current narrative of progressiveness in Nepal impacted real change for the LGBTQIA+ community?It’s time to move beyond this narrative of progressiveness. True progress should lead to further development, not be a barrier to it. Unfortunately, the current narrative seems to be stagnating.For instance, when we raise issues with the government, the response often is, “We’ve already given you the right to citizenship. You’re getting citizenship now.” Even when I travel people sometimes ask, “You’ve got citizenship, right? Things are becoming progressive.” This narrative of progressiveness has become an excuse for the government to claim they’ve done enough and to avoid further action.This surface-level progressiveness is used to showcase Nepal as forward-thinking internationally, but it hasn’t translated into real change for people at the grassroots. It also impedes activists’ efforts by providing the government with a shield against criticism. Until this narrative of progressiveness evolves into genuine, accountable action that goes beyond court decisions and performative gestures, it will continue to be a barrier to actual progress. \nThe Federal Parliament last month passed the bill to amend the Enforced Disappearances Enquiry, Truth and Reconciliation Commission Act. Political parties displayed exemplary unity in the course of endorsing the bill, which was promptly welcomed by the international community. If this undertaking succeeds, the remaining tasks of Nepal’s nearly two-decade-long peace process will be completed. In this context, the Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal and Binod Ghimire sat down with constitutional expert and former lawmaker Radheshyam Adhikari of Nepali Congress, who has over the years been closely involved in Nepal’s transitional justice process.As a legal expert, how do you see the latest amendment in the transitional justice Act?Looking at it from a legal perspective, the Supreme Court’s order given in this context is the major basis. The amendment has complied with over 95 percent of the top court’s directives. There is one more context we can refer to. The government in 2018 had prepared a ‘zero draft’ on this issue. The international community had expressed their reservations on certain provisions. Most of the contents of that draft have been retained while addressing those reservations. There are some major improvements. The amendment has taken a more liberal approach to victims’ rights. For instance, the draft had only said that the victims would be consulted for reconciliation but the latest amendment made victims’ consent mandatory. If a victim doesn’t want to give consent, he or she can go to court. This is a major change. Likewise, the draft had said the verdict of the to-be-formed Special Court [with a mandate to hear and decide the transitional justice related cases] would be final. But the amendment has allowed the dissatisfied side to appeal in the Supreme Court. There is a plan for a separate fund to carry out transitional justice related tasks so as to ensure fiscal autonomy for the two transitional justice commissions. This process needs fiscal as well as administrative autonomy. You just mentioned that the new Act has complied with 95 percent of the top court’s directives. Could you elaborate on the remaining five percent?I meant to say that the amendment is closer to the court’s directives. I can’t say it is 100 percent because even they [the Supreme Court justices] at the time said ‘so and so’ should be done on a hypothetical ground as so many things were still evolving. Now, some issues might have become redundant. But most of the things have been addressed. See, first, we should have conceptual clarity. There is a fundamental difference between retributive justice and transitional justice systems. In retributive justice, cases are decided by regular courts based on existing laws while in the transitional justice system we have to look into political, social as well as cultural aspects. This is the internationally accepted approach.The amendment has included a provision of up to 75 percent reduced sentencing. The attorney general, who works for the government, is mandated to recommend this. Isn’t this akin to directing the court? Wouldn’t it instead be prudent to leave that to the court? If that were not done, there would be mistrust and the process may not have gotten sufficient support from the warring sides of the past. In such a scenario, the process may have again failed. A supportive role of the stakeholders will be crucial. Of late, I often urge the victims to cooperate with the process; otherwise it will remain a never-ending process. It’s already too late. So, now we should be pragmatic. We should carry out things on a priority basis. Finding and respecting truth are the first and second priorities. The option to go to court is there, if someone wants so. The fourth priority is reparation. The goal is to establish that no one will need to take up arms and resort to violence in Nepal again. Now, most of the stakeholders are positive about concluding this process. The international community has in fact asked us what type of support we need.It is said the role of Desmond Tutu, who led the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of South Africa, was crucial for the success of the country’s transitional justice process. Do you think the personality of the heads of the commissions will be vital in our case as well?Leadership definitely matters. In Colombia as well, a person of similar stature, who is respected by all sides in the country, led the process. So, the leadership and composition of the commissions will matter. The commissions should be allowed to work and make decisions on their own.There are nearly 64,000 complaints with the TRC and around 2,400 with the CIEDP. How should the commissions carry out their task? Will they deal with each and every case individually? What are international practices and what is a broader conceptual understanding in our case?It is too early to talk about the working modality but I believe most cases should be dealt with in a representative way. But cases of serious rights violations will enter the prosecution stage. Producing sufficient evidence to prove the crimes, however, will be challenging. For instance, some rape victims may not be able to name the perpetrators. They were raped but couldn’t even recognise the perpetrator. In such a case, the state should respect such victims and provide reparation to them. Some complainants may choose not to continue with the cases. Before determining whether certain cases are serious or not, each file has to be checked at least once. So, the commissions need a large number of investigating officers. Field offices need to be set up based on the number and nature of complaints. What kind of involvement of international agencies may be needed for this process?It will certainly need the involvement of international agencies. Nepal’s peace process is basically home-grown but we will also seek support and expertise from international agencies, as we did in the past. We never work in isolation but the areas where we need their support will be decided only after the commissions start their work. We need international experts for certain specialised tasks, such as conducting DNA tests and exhuming bodies buried during the insurgency. The way the international community promptly welcomed the new amendment, it seems that the government and political parties were working in close consultation with them. Is that so?As far as I am informed, everything was done by Nepalis. But there was communication with the international agencies. They had earlier expressed their concerns on the ‘zero draft’ and the issues have been addressed. Therefore, they promptly welcomed it. They obviously are involved indirectly because it is a matter the international community is closely watching. But now we may need their direct support to carry out certain specialised tasks.Why didn’t the amendment even mention the use of child soldiers, crime against humanity and war crime?It is a matter of serious consideration as to whether our cases fall under the definition of serious crimes such as crime against humanity. The commissions will study this aspect as well.Don’t you think the provision of reduced sentencing and overlooking of certain legal aspects may promote impunity?Even now, inmates get a waiver of around 50 percent under the regular legal system. So the provision to reduce sentences is already there.But such sentences are reduced only after serving for a certain time and demonstrating good behaviour. Shouldn’t we have adopted a similar approach in this case?Transitional justice system should be seen a bit differently. Here, I give you an example. In Colombia, the TRC of the country summoned the seven secretariat members of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC). They were first briefed about the charges registered against them. They admitted that they committed the crimes. Then, all of them were acquitted because they spoke the truth. The TRC in Colombia gave priority to finding the truth. If someone showed honesty and cooperated in finding the truth they wouldn’t be punished. But they increased the penalty for those who tried to mislead them through falsehood.Can we say our process is a bit driven by a reparative approach?I again stress that we should look at the transitional justice process differently than how we look at the retributive justice system. It needs a different law, different court and a different jurisprudence.It takes years of rigorous work to complete this process and firm commitment of major political forces is vital. Frequent changes in coalition and unpredictable relations between the political forces is our reality. Don’t you think such instability may hamper this process?This time around, the role of Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli is very positive. Chiefs of the three biggest parties, while addressing a parliament meeting, have expressed their commitment to make this process successful. Their unity on this matter is important. Not only them, all the political parties represented in the federal parliament, except one lawmaker from a fringe party, have supported this amendment. It has thus become a national issue. I hope this consensus will remain intact while picking officials for the commissions and taking the entire process to a logical end.Given your expertise and involvement in this process, you are being seen as a strong candidate for the TRC chair. What is the reality?I have nothing to say as no one has talked to me about this. \nLately, road accidents are taking place almost every day. Thousands of people lose their lives in road crashes every year across the country. What are the factors causing these disasters? Why have the authorities failed to prevent them? The Post's Thira Lal Bhusal sat down with former secretary Arjun Jung Thapa, who was director general at the Department of Roads for years, to discuss the pressing issue.Why are road accidents taking place so frequently in Nepal? There is no one reason for road accidents. On the infrastructure front, factors like design, condition and geometry of a road are crucial. Putting sign boards along the roads and giving vital information about the particular location is necessary. Those signs should be placed properly so all driving vehicles and passengers can see them clearly. Some technical aspects, such as whether the superelevation is properly designed, particularly at sharp bends, matter greatly. These must be regularly monitored and corrected in time. Regular vehicle fitness tests are essential. Experienced and disciplined drivers are equally important to ensure road safety. Some accidents occur when drivers are unfamiliar with the roads. For instance, the accident that took place at Anbukhaireni of Tanahun district on Friday, killing 27 Indian nationals, might have been because of the driver’s lack of familiarity with the road condition. Yet another serious concern is the lack of road discipline. Those who come to Nepal with years-long experience of driving abroad fear driving because of motorists' reckless driving and lack of lane discipline. The recent accident at Jadibuti, killing one scooter rider, could have been avoided if proper lane discipline had been followed. Reckless driving by motorcyclists has remained a big problem in our case. So, a separate lane should be designated for bikers. Similarly, lanes should be designated for vehicles based on their speed. But such rules are never followed seriously in our case. Traffic police have been entrusted with enforcing traffic rules but lack the human resources to enforce them effectively. We need an integrated and centrally controlled digital traffic light management system. We had experimented with a system as a trial for some time after 2015. We called a bid but couldn’t accept anyone as the bidders proposed more than the rate we had fixed. The project collapsed, and that system could never be revived. We badly lack technology in this sector. When we try to import technology, brokers get involved and ruin the entire process. The condition of roads built haphazardly, mainly in the hills, is another major concern. What do you say about that?We have built around 80,000 kilometres of road across the country. Of that, only around 14,000 kilometres fall under the jurisdiction of the road department. The rest of the road sections fall under the jurisdiction of various authorities, such as the Department of Local Infrastructure and provincial and local governments. The busiest roads are those under the Department of Roads. They are highways and regional roads. Only 50 percent of the roads overseen by the Department of Roads are blacktopped and are not maintained properly. Of the remaining 65,000 kilometres of road, only 4,000 kilometres are blacktopped. This means that the road condition across the country is poor and must be upgraded. The government will now develop the Kakarvitta-Gorusinghe section of the East-West Highway as a safe demonstration corridor. There will be proper infrastructure for crossings, grade-separated intersections, controlled entries, fencing for the safety from wild animals and crossings for wildlife. Local vehicles will run on service lanes. If it is developed as planned, it would be on par with Asian standards. Other roads in the pipeline will follow these standards. These criteria are being implemented while upgrading the Nagdhunga-Mugling road section as well. We have miles to go to upgrade our roads to international standards. Why are we failing to make quality roads?We can’t build our roads according to the original design. At times, locals obstruct road construction and force us to change the alignments. Then, we have to build them based on the availability of the land.Are our rural roads fit from the engineering perspective?Around 35,000 kilometers out of the 65,000 kilometers of roads that don’t fall under the jurisdiction of the Department of Roads are built randomly. Local leaders, influential individuals, and bulldozer operators fix the alignments of such roads.How can we rectify the malpractices in this sector?We need to activate the National Road Safety Council urgently. Officials from all the concerned departments and representatives from various stakeholders should sit together in this body and find solutions. Also, coordination has become more complicated in the federal system. For instance, highways are under federal jurisdiction, transport management on highways falls under provincial authority, while road management is under federal jurisdiction. Therefore, an effective coordinating body has become a must. Otherwise, we can’t control the increasing trend of deaths in road accidents. At least 1,700 people lost their lives in 2013, and the then government set a target to reduce it by at least 50 percent by 2020. Instead, the yearly death toll has crossed 2,800 now.While it takes years to complete road upgrading tasks, construction materials are left unmanaged and scattered, making driving along the road very difficult and dangerous. Can’t such things be improved?Contractors are powerful because of their political connection with influential leaders including prime ministers and ministers. Civil servants can’t be assertive when the contractors get political protection. At times, they try to use force to coerce government officials. If the situation is not going in their favour, they provoke locals with a plan to get extension in their contract citing local unrest. Experts say that the government is also to blame as it doesn’t carry out development projects properly. Do you agree?I worked for three decades in government agencies until a few months ago. What I found is that one government devises specific policies, plans and initiates certain projects but successive governments stop them. The new leadership starts its own plans and projects. Then, the contractors don’t get their payment. This is the other side of the story. Another problem is that our ministers, lawmakers and leaders show interest in the projects that deserve the least priority while important projects don’t get attention. For instance, around 30 kilometers of Arniko Highway, which connects Nepal with China, has been badly damaged. This is a very important road for the country. Can’t the government repair and maintain a 30-kilometer section of a highway? It requires just around Rs3 billion whereas leaders have allocated over Rs11.5 billion in the projects of personal interests of leaders. Around Rs4 billion has been allocated under lawmakers’ constituency development programmes and additional Rs5 billion has been earmarked for local bridges. We have allocated around Rs60 billion for non-important projects but we have ignored a crucial road, Arniko Highway, which was built with the support of our neighbour China in the 1960s. Thus we have given unnecessary importance where it doesn’t deserve while ignoring vital development projects. The road accidents are directly or indirectly linked to the government’s wrong policies and plans.Development projects are sometimes said to have failed due to rivalry between some leaders. Do you have any such experience?I will give you an example. In the Biratnagar-Bathnaha cross-border rail project, we had to build over 13 kilometers of the railway. It was around four to five years ago. We cleared over 11 kilometers but locals protested in the remaining section where a station was planned. The locals obstructed work there even as 85 percent of the money for land acquisition had already been distributed. Later, we found that the then minister Aman Lal Modi had provoked the locals to demand for additional money. He demanded a ‘special rate for his men’. But the laws don’t allow it.Some experts argue that to upgrade the quality of our roads, we need to make this sector competitive and, for that, we have to allow the private sector to develop projects. Is it viable?The government is hindering the private sector from entering into this business. They don’t invest without assured returns. They need roads like Kathmandu-Tarai Expressway. The government called for proposals in the build-operate-transfer (BOT) model for this project. They were interested. But the government simultaneously allowed a company to build the Kathmandu-Tunnel Road in the same area. Then the investors felt a risk to invest there. But, the company couldn’t continue the tunnel project. Private sector should be welcomed in this sector but we should create a conducive environment for that. Bangladesh and India have built infrastructure projects under the BOT model. We can do it as well.What do you think about the jurisdictional dispute over the New Road stretch between the Kathmandu Metropolis and the Department of Roads? Who should maintain this road?All the roads within the metropolis fall under the local government’s jurisdiction, as the constitution clearly states. The federal department is managing the roads with the understanding that the local governments are not efficient at maintaining them for now. If a local unit wants to maintain a certain road section on its own, the department should allow it without any dispute. Both sides showed childish behaviour while handling the New Road case. \nCPN (Unified Socialist) leader Ram Kumari Jhakri was among the most active leaders involved in the formation of the party after split with the CPN-UML in 2021. Three years on, she is now the most vocal leader calling for a unification of the two parties. Why didn’t the new party perform well, and what made her lobby for a party merger? Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal sat with former minister Jhakri for more insights.You worked actively to form the CPN (Unified Socialist), but the party couldn’t perform well. It couldn’t even become a national party from the general elections. What went wrong?We formed the CPN (Unified Socialist) out of compulsion. When Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli—who was prime minister at the time as well—dissolved the House of Representatives in December 2020, we firmly stood against his move, saying that it sowed the seeds of political instability. We staged huge protests and moved the Supreme Court against the decision of Oli, our party chair at the time. I was among the petitioners. Once the top court reinstated the House, we expected the party to move smoothly. Unfortunately, that couldn’t happen. The party establishment led by Oli and the rival faction took extreme actions against each other. The agitating faction announced action against the party chair, and the party establishment expelled us from the party itself. When Oli dissolved the House a second time, we protested the move as it brought instability. We were in favour of transforming the party through intra-party struggle, but the situation took some unexpected turns. We didn’t quit the party with a lofty plan of making a new revolutionary organisation. We were compelled to do so.Our new party accommodated many genuine leaders who had been sidelined in the UML. But ultimately, old leaders heavily dominated the new party’s central committee. They were active leaders of their time but were out of touch with the new, changing context. Young leaders didn’t get space in party committees. I proposed recruiting at least 40 percent members under 40 years in the central committee and over 50 percent members under 30 years in the district committees. I made a 29-year-old leader the chair of the district committee in my home district. In 42 days, I attended 36 district conventions where youths in their 30s were elected district committee chairs. I tried to reach out to municipalities to promote youths in the party chapters. But at the central level, old faces dominated party committees. That didn’t attract people to the party or impress the general public. Thus, it failed to gather steam right from the beginning.Many think that Madhav Kumar Nepal’s selection as party chief was a wrong move since he had led the UML for 15 years and become prime minister, and people didn’t find novelty in the new party. Do you think so too?Madhav Kumar Nepal has been the most active leader in the party since its inception. Whatever the party has achieved so far is because of him. But a party leader must mobilise teams with defined roles and responsibilities and continuously motivate and engage them in result-oriented tasks. He works a lot but doesn’t mobilise teams effectively. Observers say the Unified Socialist was formed due to the personality clash between top leaders and that it lacked a national agenda and a clear policy to prove the need for a new party. Do you feel so?Our immediate agenda was safeguarding the constitution and ensuring political stability in the country. We protested the House dissolution guided by the same policy. But when provincial governments were made like satellites of the federal government, we couldn’t play any role in stabilising them.The UML is guided by the policy of People’s Multiparty Democracy, propounded by the late Madan Bhandari. There was a debate on further enhancing the policy in the changed context. A large section of Left intellectuals were interested in contributing to that. We could have engaged them in the process. But our party stopped the debate on that topic as well. We missed the chance of engaging many critical individuals in the discourse and having a relatively different policy. When in the UML, we practised direct elections of party representatives and leaders from the conventions. Unfortunately, leaders of the new party, Unified Socialist, made a statute that gave powers to the party leadership to nominate party secretariat, office bearers and other members. Leaders would pick those who are loyal to them. This regressive approach killed competition in the party.You are known to prefer a more proactive work and decision-making approach. There are rumours that you have been fed up with the party’s lacklustre style and are mulling to join the mother party, UML.If I were to decide only from a personal perspective, I would have done so much earlier because I had multiple opportunities in the past. But I am for party merger because I don’t see any relevance of running multiple retail shops under communist banners because we are not substantially different from each other in terms of policies. Our electoral system has also made it necessary. The Unified Socialist can’t run like this. We must accept reality and decide—merging our party with the UML is better than running it this way. But it seems that the top leaders of the twin parties are still bitter about each other.True, the bitterness lingers on, mainly among the top leaders. We have also made some mistakes. The UML offered some opportunities to the Unified Socialist, and we should have made some offers to capitalise on the favourable situation. At one time, UML leaders proposed our party chair as a candidate for the vacant post of the country’s President. We should have devised our own proposal and made a win-win deal. But we ran away and squandered the opportunity. If Madhav Kumar Nepal had become president on the UML’s proposal, our party might have been reunited with the UML much earlier. I also took an initiative to that end but in vain. Later also, UML chair Oli visited our party chair’s residence to have our party on board the government. But the reaction from our side ruined things. We are certainly not responding to the UML responsibly. Rather than irritate the UML, we must turn each positive gesture into an opportunity for party unity.One more factor is blocking the unity between the two parties. There are a large number of second-rung leaders in the UML who can’t directly confront Oli. They are now encouraging former President Bidya Devi Bhandari to join active politics and trying to make decisions in their favour through her. Oli knows these leaders will support Nepal when he returns to the UML. Why would he [Oli] then merge the fringe party and create another power centre against himself? He knows Madhav Kumar Nepal will challenge him with the backing of the dissidents. It is natural for a leader to think twice before allowing another leader of your stature to create a parallel power centre within the organisation. Even I would have thought twice. This is a major factor hindering party unity.Your party chair and other key leaders seem quite close to CPN (Maoist Centre) chair Pushpa Kamal Dahal and critical of UML chair Oli. Moreover, Oli often lambasts Madhav Kumar Nepal publicly. Will they still merge the parties?In principle, our party is open for unity with any Left party. But party cadres won’t join the Maoist Centre. If our leadership decides to merge the party with the Maoists, a huge number of our party cadres will join the UML. Unity between the UML and the Unified Socialist is natural because we grew up in the same background and orientation. But we are quite different from Maoists. Several groups trying to form new political outfits have failed to emerge as a major political force and sustain themselves. You worked in a big party for years and also helped establish a new one. What are the challenges of forming a new political organisation in Nepal?Political parties sustain if they evolve with society. If you trace the history of the Nepal’s Congress and communist parties, you will see how they have evolved over the past seven decades. They competed against each other but joined hands to fight autocratic forces towards establishing democracy. They have done hundreds of progressive things in society. Their major fault is that they have multiple entry points but no exit policy. The only exit way is the death of the leaders. This has caused unhealthy practices and created dissident groups.The dissidents who didn’t get any space within their party formed new outfits. They also amplified negative narratives against the old parties. It happened with the Congress, the UML and the Maoist Centre. Had there been an exit system in the party, the situation wouldn’t be this bad. But new political parties can’t sustain without their own political ideology and orientation. You may form an organisation, cash in on people’s frustration and achieve some immediate gains, but outfits can’t sustain.But recent electoral trends show that Nepalis are seeking alternative forces and new faces. Can we be oblivious to that?You are right. We have seen such trends in the Panchayat system as well. But garnering votes during elections for one term and establishing a sustainable political force are two different things.  \nParts of the hilly regions in Koshi and Bagmati provinces are likely to experience light to moderate rainfall along with thunderstorms on Thursday, the Meteorological Forecasting Division said.Other hilly areas of the country, including Gandaki Province, could also see sporadic rainfall tonight.The weather forecast for today shows that hilly areas will be partly to generally cloudy, while other regions of Nepal will remain partly cloudy to mostly clear.The rainfall, caused by the influence of monsoon winds, is expected to persist in some regions tonight as well. The monsoon trough remains around its average position in the west and slightly south of its normal position in the east, affecting weather conditions across the country.Janakpur recorded the highest temperature at 37.4°C, Jomsom saw the lowest at 10.5°C, and Taplejung received the highest rainfall with 2.6 mm. \nOn Wednesday Lumbini, Karnali and Sudur Pashchim Province along with the hilly regions of the country will remain partly to generally cloudy. While the rest of the country will remain partly cloudy to mainly fair.Light to moderate rain with thunder and lightning is likely to occur at a few places of Karnali Province and Sudur Pashchim Province and hilly regions of the country, at one or two places of the rest of the country. The Meteorological Forecasting Division has forecast a chance of wind gusts at a few places of Lumbini Province.Tonight the weather will be partly to generally cloudy in Koshi and Sudur Pashchim Province along with the hilly regions of the country and Partly cloudy to mainly fair in the rest of the country. Light to moderate rain is likely to occur at one or two places of hilly regions of Koshi, Bagmati, Gandaki and Karnali Province.On Tuesday, the highest temperature was recorded in Janakpur at 34.4°C, while the lowest was recorded in Jomsom at 12.5°C.The highest rainfall recorded in the past 24 hours was in Birendranagar at 39.5 mm. Kathmandu on Tuesday experienced the highest temperature of 29.4°C and the lowest of 19.9°C. \nOn Tuesday the weather throughout the country is forecast to be partly to generally cloudy.Light to moderate rain with thunder and lightning is likely to occur at some places of Gandak, Lumbini, Karnali and Sudur Pashchim Province as well as one or two places of the rest of the provincesToday one or two places of the Sudur Pashchim Province is likely to experience heavy rainfall. Gusty wind is likely to occur at a few places of Tarai region of Koshi and a few places of Madesh Province.Tonight the weather will be partly to generally cloudy in Gandaki, Lumbini, Karnali and Sudur Pashchim Province. The rest of the country will be partly cloudy to mainly fair. Light to moderate rain with thunder and lightning is likely to occur at a few places of Karnali and Sudur Pashchim Province and at one or two places of the rest of the provinces.On Monday, the highest temperature was recorded in Nepalgunj at 34.8°C, while the lowest was recorded in Jiri at 14.4°C.The highest rainfall recorded in the past 24 hours was in Kathmandu at 22.5 mm, followed by Dharan with 15.8 mm, and Bhairahawa with 14.8 mm. \nNepal has recorded above-average rainfall during the ongoing monsoon season, the Department of Hydrology and Meteorology said.According to the department's data, the country received 1,501 millimetres of rainfall as of Monday morning since the monsoon entered on June 10, which is 101.6 percent—1.6 percent above the average monsoon rainfall. Normally, the country receives an average of 1,472 mm of rainfall in the four months of the monsoon—June, July, August, and September. Last year, however, the country witnessed only 1,303 mm of rainfall during the four monsoon months, 88.5 percent of the average.As predicted before the onset of the monsoon, experts anticipated more rainfall this year. Monsoon activities are still ongoing, and two weeks remain for the monsoon's withdrawal.“Like in the previous year, monsoon withdrawal can be extended this year as well,” said Sudarshan Humagain, an official at the department. “We take 90 percent to 110 percent average rainfall as normal. If the average rainfall exceeds 110 percent then only we call it above-average.”Data from the department show that 55 percent of the country witnessed above-average rainfall in the ongoing monsoon. According to the figures, Biratnagar airport witnessed nearly 130 percent of the average rainfall, Dharan bazar 110 percent, Dhangadhi 110 percent, Dadeldhura around 130 percent, Dipayal 160 percent, Surkhet 110 percent, Dang 130 percent, Bhairahawa 110 percent, Okhaldhunga around 130 percent, Jomsom 110 percent, Nepalgunj 110 percent, and Kathmandu around 130 percent.In contrast, Janakpur and Lumle witnessed 80 percent of the average, Simara 85 percent, Pokhara 95 percent, Jumla 85 percent, and Jiri 90 percent.The monsoon season, which typically delivers around 80 percent of the country’s annual rainfall, usually begins on June 13 and ends on October 2. But last year, the monsoon ended only on October 15. This year, the monsoon entered Nepal from the southwest on June 10, three days ahead of the usual onset date. Last year, it started on June 14, a day later than normal.Met officials said the rainfall data could vary, as they are based on data from only 20 major weather stations. The department averages data from around 400 rainfall measuring stations across the country.This year, the division forecasted above-normal rains and above-average maximum and minimum temperatures during this monsoon season, which could unleash extreme weather events such as flooding, inundation, and landslides.Several districts have already reported incidents of landslides, flooding and lightning since the start of the monsoon season.According to the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Authority, at least 235 people have died, and 49 others have been missing in the landslides flood-related incidents since June 10.Officials at the authority said that 136 people—68 males and 64 females—have been killed in landslides, 55 in floodings—30 males and 25 females—and 43 more in lightning strikes. Altogether, 288 people have been injured—126 in landslides, 26 in floods, 39 in lightning incidents, and 136 in lightning incidents. These incidents have affected 3,283 families.Meanwhile, the Meteorological Forecasting Division said light to moderate rainfall will occur in provinces nationwide on Monday night. Some places in Koshi, Bagmati, Gandaki, Lumbini, and Karnali Province could also witness isolated heavy rainfall.Met officials said that the deep depression formed near Jharkhand of India is responsible for the cloudy conditions and rainfall in the country.“Weather will gradually improve from Tuesday,” said Rojan Lamichhane, a meteorologist at the division. Nepal is one of the world’s most vulnerable countries to the climate crisis and has witnessed multiple extreme weather events over the past decade and a half.Evidence suggests that maximum temperatures in Nepal are rising faster, at 0.056 degrees Celsius a year, compared to the global average rise of 0.03 degrees.Experts say extreme weather events—excessive rainfall in a short period, continuous rains for several days after the monsoon, dry spells, droughts, below-average precipitation, and above-normal winter temperatures—have become more frequent in Nepal. \nThe Meteorological Forecasting Division has predicted partly to generally cloudy conditions across the country on Monday.Light to moderate rainfall, accompanied by thunder, lightning, and gusty winds, is likely in several parts of the country.Today, Koshi, Bagmati, Lumbini, and Karnali provinces are expected to experience light to moderate rain, with chances of heavy rainfall at one or two locations. Some areas in the hilly regions of Gandaki Province could also receive similar weather conditions.Tonight, the hilly areas of Bagmati, Gandaki, and Karnali Provinces will continue to see light to moderate rainfall. The forecast also indicates potential rain at a few locations in the rest of the provinces.According to the division, the monsoon trough is positioned north of its average location in the western region and near the average position in the east. The low-pressure system over West Bengal is also contributing to the current weather patterns.On Sunday, the highest temperature was observed in Janakpur at 34.6°C, while the lowest was recorded in Jiri at 14.4°C.The highest rainfall recorded in the past 24 hours was in Lumle at 108.5 mm, followed by Dharan with 28.7 mm, and Taplejung with 33.5 mm. \n\nBe elaborative as possible.

Write it in the form of inspiring story not news article or event.\n    \n    Story:\nOnce upon a time, nestled between the towering peaks of the Himalayas and the lush jungles of the Terai, there was a country named Nepal. Though still a developing nation, Nepal was a land of profound beauty and deep-rooted cultural heritage. The residents of Nepal faced many challenges, but beneath these hardships lay a resilient spirit and an unyielding hope for the future.\n\nThis enchanting land, where Mount Everest reaches towards the skies and the air carries a mix of incense and cool mountain breezes, was more than a geographical marvel. It was a mosaic of cultures, languages, and traditions, a testament to human endeavor against all odds. Nepal's history, from the unification under King Prithvi Narayan Shah to its transformation into a federal democratic republic, told a story of aspiration and endurance.\n\nIn recent years, the people of Nepal, with their indomitable will, had taken strides towards rebuilding and reimagining their country. They turned their struggles into stepping stones, each challenge a chapter in their ongoing saga. The shift from a monarchy to a republic had not only changed governance but had woven a new tapestry of democratic values and collective decision-making.\n\nEconomically, while agriculture continued to sustain a large part of its population, Nepal had begun to harness the potential of its picturesque landscapes, developing sustainable tourism that promised to preserve their natural heritage while boosting local economies. Communities living in the shadows of the Himalayas had become stewards of the earth, protecting the biodiversity that made their country unique.\n\nEach day brought new stories. Whether it was a festival in Kathmandu, a technological advance in Pokhara, or a conservation effort in Chitwan, these events were threads in the vibrant quilt of Nepali life. These stories, updated daily, reflected the pulse of progress and the spirit of hope that characterized this resilient nation.\n\nAnd so, as Nepal moved forward, each moment was not just a passage of time but a promise of potential, a narrative of a nation perennially climbing towards tomorrow, guided by the legacy of its past and the dreams of its future.\n\nNews events:\nThe erstwhile Pushpa Kamal Dahal government on April 12 constituted a committee led by Om Prakash Mishra, a former chief justice, to nominate candidates to the Truth and Reconciliation Commission and the Commission of Investigation on Enforced Disappeared Persons. While the government picked four members for the committee, the fifth member is either the chairperson of the National Human Rights Commission or someone nominated by him. Initially, the commission had insisted that revision of the Enforced Disappearance Enquiry, Truth and Reconciliation Commission Act was a precondition for its participation in the committee, but following the Act’s amendment, it agreed to join the Mishra panel. However, three weeks after President Ramchandra Paudel authenticated the bill to amend the Act that the federal parliament endorsed, the constitutional human rights watchdog has yet to recommend its representative. Its officials said they are waiting for a formal request from the Ministry of Law, Justice and Parliamentary Affairs, as they expect a new letter in the changed context.“We have been told the ministry would send a new request letter for our representative, given the new context following the amendment to the Act,” said a commission member. The revised Act states that the recommendation committee has two months to make nominations for the chairpersons and members of the two commissions. It has already been five months since the Mishra-led panel was formed. However, a senior official at the law ministry said he does not think a new process needs to start just because the Act has been amended. “The two month countdown began the day the revised Act was enacted,” said the official. “I also don’t think the ministry told the commission that it would send a new request letter. If such a message was conveyed, it may have come from the political level.” Those involved in forging all-party consensus on the amendment say tensions between the CPN-UML and the CPN (Maoist Centre) have stalled the transitional justice process. Relations between the two parties have not been cordial ever since the formation of the new ruling alliance. The UML has consistently referred to the Maoist insurgency as ‘violence’, while the Maoist Centre has warned that the present KP Sharma Oli government could meet the same fate as Sheikh Hasina Wazed, the immediate past prime minister of Bangladesh.“The tussle between the two parties has directly affected the ongoing process,” one leader involved in the negotiations told the Post. “Oli doesn't seem as interested as he was earlier.”The committee was formed in May amid reservations from conflict-era victims of human rights violations and human rights defenders, who demanded that the Act be amended before selecting office bearers. The government, however, argued that forming the committee was necessary as per the Supreme Court’s March 12 order to the government to select office bearers for the two commissions within a month.The court had asked the government to constitute task forces within the commissions to conduct preliminary investigations into the victims’ complaints until the office bearers were appointed.Following the court’s order, the victims and human rights defenders demanded the government and the parties endorse the legal amendments by the top court’s deadline before starting the selection process. However, the amendment bill couldn’t be endorsed within the deadline, prompting the government to form a committee based on existing law.Following the committee’s formation, the victims and human rights defenders requested the government to halt the selection process until the Act was amended. They also urged the national rights watchdog to hold off on sending its representative.The two commissions have been defunct since July 2022, when the government decided to extend their terms without retaining their chairmen and members. The government claimed the bill to amend the transitional justice law would be endorsed by October 2022, and the appointments made based on the revised Act.But it took over two years for the federal parliament to endorse the bill. The victims and human rights defenders are closely watching who will be appointed to the commissions.The Truth Commission has received 63,718 complaints, while the commission on disappearances is sitting on around 2,400 cases. The new teams will have four years to accomplish their tasks, though there are provisions for their extension. The commissions that were formed in 2015 have done nothing other than collect complaints and conduct preliminary investigations on some of them.  \nAlong with dengue infection, major hospitals in the Kathmandu Valley are seeing a significant surge in cases of viral fever, flu, typhoid, and seasonal influenza in recent days.Doctors attending to the patients said that the number of fever cases has risen compared to previous months, with some patients even developing pneumonia and requiring inpatient care due to worsening health.“Around 50 percent of the patients who come to the outpatient department at our hospital are fever cases,” said Dr Rita Hamal, a consultant paediatrician at the Chabahil-based Om Hospital and Research Centre. “Some children have also been diagnosed with pneumonia and have been admitted at the hospital for inpatient care.”Experts say the rise in fever and cold before weather transitions is concerning and that the spread of the virus could be behind the surge in infection rates.They say the influenza virus causes respiratory complications, which affect the lungs. The virus spreads quickly in communities. These diseases can cause fever, cough, body aches, occasional vomiting, diarrhoea, and pneumonia.Doctors say that while the number of new cases of fever and flu has risen significantly, the exact cause of the surge still remains unclear. Many patients do not opt for various diagnostic tests, and health workers also provide symptomatic care first.“There is no specific care for viral infections, including dengue,” said Hamal. “We provide symptomatic care only. So we do not know the actual cause of the ailments.”Doctors recommend multiple tests only for patients with serious health conditions. They say that early diagnosis is crucial for preventing infection, and patients recover quickly if treated in time. However, according to experts, the severity of the disease and the number of deaths increase if seasonal influenza cases are not diagnosed promptly.“We don’t know the actual cause of the surge in fever, flu, and other ailments,” said Dr Sumit Agrawal, spokesperson at the Kanti Children Hospital. “Almost all hospital beds have been occupied by ailing patients, and the number of fever cases has risen significantly recently.”The hospital, which also serves as the national referral centre for ailing children, said that over 1,200 children seek care daily, and 30 to 40 percent of them are fever and flu cases.Doctors at Sukraraj Tropical and Infectious Disease Hospital and Patan Hospital also said that the number of fever and flu cases has risen significantly of late.“Along with dengue cases, the number of people suffering from viral fever, flu, typhoid and other infections has increased at our hospital as well,” said Dr Yuba Nidhi Basaula, director at the Sukraraj Tropical and Infectious Disease Hospital in Teku, Kathmandu. “Most of the beds in our hospital have been occupied. The number of dengue infection cases has also surged lately.”Doctors at Patan Hospital said that in addition to fever cases, patients with diarrhoeal infections and other water-borne diseases are also seeking care. They expect more cases in the coming days, as fever and flu cases usually spike during weather transitions.Even though fever and flu cases are rising significantly, authorities remain unaware of the exact cause of the surge in infection rates.“When the cause of ailments is not ascertained, it becomes difficult to provide effective care,” said Dr Sher Bahadur Pun, chief of the Clinical Research Unit at Sukraraj Hospital. “The number of people infected with influenza could be several times higher than those seeking care at hospitals, as many people suffering from influenza-like illness do not seek treatment unless they become serious.”A recent report by the Nepal Statistics Office also shows that cold and fever remain a significant concern, with an increase from 43.7 percent in 1995/96 to 51. 5 percent in 2022/23.Doctors say more people get infected with viruses during seasonal changes, as most viruses—adenovirus, rhinovirus, influenza virus, and even coronavirus—become active during these times, particularly in winter.However, they say this does not mean respiratory viruses do not spread at other times. People are continuously infected with respiratory viruses in other seasons as well, and those with weak immunity could become more severely affected by infections.Doctors urge everyone to take precautions against these risks and ask authorities to step up surveillance to determine the real causes of influenza-like illnesses. \nThe coalition government of the CPN-UML and the Nepali Congress has reiterated its commitment to review the achievements made and weaknesses observed in the course of implementing the constitution in the past nine years.The two ruling parties have pledged to amend the constitution based on a broader understanding made through discussions, dialogues and consultations with political parties, civil society, intelligentsia, constitutional experts and the public.The parties have said such amendments will be made mainly based on the findings of the review and experiences of implementing it. Moreover, the parties said that establishing political stability in the country would be the major objective of the amendment.The two ruling parties made the commitments in the common minimum programme of the government, which was submitted to Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli and Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba on Wednesday evening. The parties had earlier formed a four-member panel to draft the government’s programme based on a seven-point agreement reached between the Congress and the UML in the first week of July. Party general secretary Gagan Thapa and spokesperson Prakash Sharan Mahat from Congress, and party deputy general secretaries Pradeep Gyawali and Bishnu Rimal from the CPN-UML were tasked to prepare the document. They jointly submitted the document to the two party chiefs and made it public.“The achievements of the 2006 movement and the fundamental pillars of this constitution including federal, republic and inclusive governance system will be further institutionalised and strengthened,” the document says.The seven-page document is divided into eight subtitles—safeguarding national interest and independent foreign policy; protection, implementation and amendment of the constitution; good governance and quality service delivery; dynamic economy and development; ensuring social justice and fundamental rights; youth partnership; transitional justice, sustainable peace and social harmony; and miscellaneous.The coalition has pledged to set up a high-powered cooperative regulatory body as per the recommendation of the parliamentary inquiry committee to address the problems seen in the cooperative sector.“Taking action against those involved in misusing funds from cooperatives, the return of depositors’ money will be ensured,” the common minimum programme states.The ruling parties have pledged to punish corrupt people irrespective of the individuals’ power and positions. On the economic front, the coalition has vowed to expedite generation and transmission of hydroelectricity and further intensify the electrification process. \nOman snatched a dramatic one-wicket victory over Nepal in a thrilling encounter during the ICC Men’s Cricket World Cup League 2 match in King City, Canada on Wednesday, chasing down a 221-run target with just one ball to spare.After being put in to bat, Nepal struggled to build momentum early on. The opening pair of Arjun Saud (5) and Aasif Sheikh (11) fell cheaply, leaving Nepal in trouble at 22-2 in the 11th over. Bhim Sharki (11) also departed soon after, further slowing down Nepal’s progress.Captain Rohit Paudel anchored the innings with a solid 60 off 72 balls, stabilising the innings after the early collapse. He received support from Aarif Sheikh (35 off 88), who played a patient knock, ensuring the team reached a respectable total.The turning point of Nepal’s innings came when Gulsan Jha walked to the crease. Jha blasted 53 off just 35 balls, including five sixes and three boundaries, lifting Nepal to 220-9 by the end of their 50 overs.Oman’s bowlers were disciplined, with Kaleemullah (2-39) and Fayyaz Butt (2-36) leading the attack. Aqib Ilyas and Shoaib Khan chipped in with two and one wicket respectively, while Shakeel Ahmed was the most economical, conceding just 29 runs in his 10 overs.In response, Oman made a strong start, with openers Kashyap Prajapati (36 off 52) and Jatinder Singh (41 off 49) laying a solid foundation. Their partnership for the first wicket gave Oman the platform to chase the target comfortably. However, Nepal’s spinners brought them back into the game. Legspinner Sandeep Lamichhane trapped Jatinder Singh LBW, while Gulsan Jha spun magic with his five-wicket haul, dismissing Aqib Ilyas (29), Ayaan Khan (9), Shoaib Khan (26), and Fayyaz Butt (8), leaving Oman in a precarious position at 198-8.Shakeel Ahmed, batting at number nine, held his ground with an unbeaten 17 off 24 balls. Jay Odedra was dismissed for 5, but Kaleemullah’s crucial 6 not out, alongside Ahmed, took Oman across the finish line in the final over.Gulsan Jha was the standout performer for Nepal, taking 5-47 in his 10 overs to go along with his half-century. Despite his all-round heroics, Nepal couldn’t prevent Oman from securing a thrilling win. \nThe fate of four proposed ambassadors, who are being vetted by the parliamentary hearing special committee, hangs in the balance.The parliamentary committee has completed the hearing of 17 envoy nominees but its members are divided over four proposed names—Shankar Sharma (India), Kapil Shrestha (South Africa), Dhan Prasad Pandit (Israel) and Netra Prasad Timilsina (Malaysia)—and are undecided.A meeting of the hearing committee, which was scheduled for Wednesday, has been deferred till Thursday owing to the differences over the four nominees, according to committee member Shyam Ghimire.The committee had received complaints against Sharma, Shrestha, Pandit and Timilsina; and the committee itself has reservations over the nominees, said a lawmaker. Sharma, Shrestha and Pandit were recommended under the quota of Nepali Congress and Timilsina under CPN-UML’s.Committee members told the Post that several complaints were filed against the four proposed envoys, raising serious issues, so they were unable to take a concrete decision.After completing the hearing of all proposed ambassadors, a meeting was slated for Sunday to take the final decision but due to the differences among the members, the meeting was deferred. Since the Rastriya Swatantra Party held its national jamboree on Tuesday and Wednesday, the meeting is rescheduled for Thursday, Ghimire said.Even Congress and UML members on the committee seem divided this time, a lawmaker said, after Congress panelists raised questions about the credentials of Timilsina. Then UML members also raised complaints against Sharma, Shrestha and Pandit.“We do not know what Congress and UML committee members and senior party leaders are thinking and discussing but due to the nature of complaints, there are serious disputes about the four proposed ambassadors and there is growing opinion that they should be rejected,” said a member on condition of anonymity.The complainer has stated that the recommendation of Sharma, who may be repeated as Nepal’s ambassador to India, goes against the ambassadorial appointment directives (2077 BS).As per the directives, the same person cannot be reappointed to head the same diplomatic mission, the complainant says.Committee members had asked that question to Sharma as well but he replied that this should be taken up with the government, not him.The government issued the directive but it has been violated by successive governments multiple times. Therefore, ambassadorial appointments never follow the spirit of the directive.The complaint against Shrestha, who is proposed for South Africa, raises the constitutional and legal question because as per the constitutional provision, a person cannot be repeated and reappointed to another constitutional post.Similarly, a case has been filed at the Supreme Court on behalf of Timilsina wherein he seeks to get continuity as acting chair of Nepal Red Cross Society, said the complainant. So he is unfit to serve as ambassador because he has filed a petition at the Supreme Court to get continuation as the chair of Nepal Red Cross Society and the court has not cleared the deck.Defending his case, Timilsina said that as an institution, the Red Cross had filed the case, not him. Timilsina was also accused of misusing the letter pad and stamp of the Red Cross Society and forming a parallel committee even after completing his tenure. The complainer has accused that Timilsina has misused the Red Cross’s name for personal gain, misused the letter pad and stamp and made illegal correspondence to various entities. A complaint was registered at the Kathmandu District Administration Office and Nepal Police is looking into the allegations.Committee members of the Congress and the UML were divided over the complaint against Timilsina, another member said. Now the UML has threatened to disqualify all three candidates recommended by the Congress if they continue to raise questions against Timilsina.“There are some complaints filed against the proposed ambassadors which we are looking into,” said Prakash Adhikari, a lawmaker from the Janata Samajbadi Party. “We have not decided what to do.”The proposed ambassador to Israel, Pandit faces a charge that he was penalised by the Information Commission and is thus unfit to serve as ambassador.When Pandit was the chief of Padma Kanya Campus in Kathmandu, the Information Commission fined him Rs15,000 for not sharing information. Later, he moved the Appellate Court against the commission's decision but the court gave its verdict in the commission’s favour.Pandit’s statement that he will try his best to stop the ongoing war between Israel and Hamas was also criticised. But Pandit defended his case during the hearing process stating that the fine was imposed on the campus chief of Padmakanya Campus, not him as a person.The government had recommended Naresh Bikram Dhakal (Saudi Arabia), Prof Dr Kapilman Shrestha (South Africa), Prof Dhana Prasad Pandit (Israel), Ram Krishna Bhattarai (Sri Lanka), Sanil Nepal (Spain), and Dr Shail Rupakheti (Germany) as ambassadors.The recommendation of Kanta Rijal for the Australia mission was later changed with the government choosing Chitra Lekha Yadav instead. Incumbent Foreign Secretary Sewa Lamasal has been recommended for the European Union and Brussels but both nominations have yet to be sent to the parliamentary hearing special committee.Lok Darshan Regmi (USA), Chandra Kumar Ghimire (UK), Shiva Maya Tumbahangphe (South Korea), Junga Bahadur Chauhan (Russia), Ramesh Chandra Poudel (Qatar), Prof Dr Krishna Prasad Oli (China), Dr Sumnima Tuladhar (Denmark), Dr Netra Prasad Timilsina (Malaysia), Prakash Mani Pokhrel (Portugal) and Rita Dhital (Pakistan) are others recommended for ambassador positions.“We will discuss the matter with legal experts and will proceed accordingly,” said Ghimire. “If someone wants to disqualify any ambassador, one needs a strong reason. But the complaints were not serious.” Taking an exception to the nomination, the hearing committee on September 9 summoned Foreign Minister Arzu Rana and inquired why the government had failed to make the appointments inclusive.On July 29, the government recommended 17 ambassadors and recalled some. The recommendations also failed to honour the spirit of inclusiveness. \nThe government has imposed a ban on carrying even licensed weapons in government offices and public spaces.The Ministry of Home Affairs issued an order putting a ban on carrying registered weapons in parliamentary buildings, courts, government offices, hospitals, educational institutions, public transport, marketplaces, shopping malls, cinemas, and other public and government locations.Publishing the notice in the National Gazette, the ministry said that the carrying of weapons by an individual is strictly prohibited except for renewal of permits.The government decision follows the arrest of medical entrepreneur Durga Prasai’s bodyguard in March 2024 at the Supreme Court premises, where he was found with an automatic weapon and ammunition. In response, the government launched a nationwide investigation into licensed firearms. Consequently, on September 16, the ministry published a notice in the gazette, introducing regulations on the use of licensed weapons and banning their use outside the home.“Invoking the authority granted by Section 8 of the Arms and Ammunition Act 1962, and in accordance with Section 3 of the same Act, individuals licensed to own or carry firearms are prohibited from taking such weapons outside their homes unless they hold a travel permit under Sections 4 and 5,” the gazette said. “Even licensed weapons cannot be carried into judicial bodies, parliamentary buildings and premises, or government offices, except for the purpose of renewing permits.”Similarly, firearms are banned in hospitals, airports, public transport, religious and educational institutions, cinemas, commercial buildings, marketplaces, shopping malls, gatherings or protests, archaeological and protected sites, children’s homes, and other locations prohibited by prevailing laws.Section 8 of the Arms and Ammunition Act 1962 specifies that the “government may prohibit the possession of firearms or ammunition in designated areas through a notice published in the Nepal Gazette.” This section grants the government the authority to forbid any individual from keeping or carrying specified firearms or ammunition in areas it deems necessary. \nThe Specialty Soy and Grains Alliance (SSGA), a business alliance of identity preserved agriculture in the United States, hosted the US Identity Preserved International Workshop at the Marriott Hotel, Naxal on Thursday.Identity preservation is a meticulous process of maintenance of unique qualities of a food product. The event brought together Nepal’s leading soy manufacturers, industry leaders, and farmers to explain the value and benefits of US-identified preserved grains and oilseeds. One of the event's highlights was Shree Radhe Rani International Trading receiving the first Identity Preservation Certificate in the world. This certification allows Nepali soy sauce manufacturers using American soy to display the ‘Identity Preserved United States’ logo on their products, which will help them boost their credibility and market value in the global market. “Our company is the first to receive the Identity Preserved certificate in the world. From today, Nepali soy sauce manufacturers using American soy can display the IP logo on all their products. This achievement was made possible with the help and support of the Specialty Soy and Grains Alliance (SSGA) and the US Soybean Export Council (USSEC),” said Gaurav Agrawal, Director of Shree Radhe Rani International Trading. The event also showcased local foods from US identity-preserved soy, including nuts, flours, tofu, and desserts.The workshop had several key speakers, including Tom Frisch, a US-based farmer who presented on growing US IP soy and other crops. Nishith Kumar, a soy food technical consultant, presented a soy food manufacturing demonstration and sampling that featured tofu, traditional sweets, toasted soy nuts, etc. Similarly, the food and beverage Director of Marriott Hotel, Joghindar Singh and Suresh Itapu, CEO of NuriTech Consulting Services Pvt Ltd, delivered presentations on the potential for premium soy in Nepal’s food and beverage sector and value-added products derived from all US IP soybeans.    \nThe Parliamentary Hearing Committee endorsed the appointment of 16 of the 17 ambassadorial nominees on Thursday.However, the committee endorsed names of four nominees through a majority of the committee as some of the members of the hearing committee expressed their differing views on the decision to endorse them. Twelve nominees were endorsed unanimously.The committee postponed the endorsement of Ramkrishna Bhattarai, the proposed ambassador to Sri Lanka, citing unavailability of his bachelor’s degree certificate.Lawmakers from the Janata Samajbadi Party Nepal (JSP-Nepal) and the Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP) registered their differing views regarding the endorsement of Kapil Shrestha, Netra Prasad Timilsina, Dhan Prasad Pandit, and Shankar Sharma, proposed ambassadors to South Africa, Malaysia, Israel, and India, respectively.The government nominated 17 individuals for various diplomatic postings. The nominations drew widespread criticism for allegedly neglecting inclusivity and ignoring established criteria for such positions. Kanta Rijal, who had been proposed as ambassador to Australia, was recalled due to performance concerns during her previous tenure in Israel. Later, the government recommended former lawmaker Chitra Lekha Yadav in her place.The ambassadorial nominees made by the government are appointed by the President for the diplomatic missions after they are endorsed by the parliamentary hearing committee. \nNepal is marking the ninth Constitution Day on Thursday. While the government is preparing to celebrate with special functions, a few Madhesh-based parties want to mark it as a Black Day. The Loktantrik Samajbadi Party is one of the disgruntled groups that has announced a protest on the occasion. But the Janamat Party, a new force that is leading the provincial government in Madhesh, has decided to celebrate the day. A document of compromise, multiple forces, including the Madhesh-based parties, have grievances over the present constitution. The CPN (Maoist Centre) registered its dissenting views on various issues at the time of drafting the constitution, including on the form of government. They stood for a directly elected presidential system and agreed to a compromise deal with other parties. The Rastriya Prajatantra Party, which lobbies for a Hindu kingdom, was against the secular republican system. The pro-monarchy party has frequently launched agitations demanding the same. A fringe Rastriya Janamorcha party has stood against federalism right from the start. Various other parties and groups oppose one or the other constitutional provision. But they haven’t taken an extreme decision to mark the day of its promulgation as a black day.It’s universally accepted that no constitution is perfect and a statute cannot satisfy all sections of the society. It is hence said that a constitution is a living document that can be amended and updated based on people’s aspirations and the changed reality. Nepal’s constitution and political forces of the country have accepted these facts. The major political forces at the time of unveiling the constitution in 2015 promised the disgruntled groups that they would address some of their ‘genuine concerns’ through amendments. They have a moral responsibility to keep their word. After its promulgation, the statute has been amended multiple times. Going against the usual parliamentary practice of one of the two largest parties forming the government and the other leading the opposition bloc in the House, Nepal’s two largest forces—the Nepali Congress and the CPN-UML—are now together in government. The given rationale for their coming together is to amend the constitution and ensure political stability. Again, it is incumbent upon them to do so based on broadest possible consultations. Registering differences, pressing the establishment to get their demands addressed and peacefully fighting for the cause they believe is a democratic right of each and every Nepali. But the manner of the protest matters. The parties and the leaders that have joined governments and governed the country multiple times, both before and after the promulgation of the constitution, should present themselves in a more mature way. It smacks of hypocrisy when they say and do one thing when in the government and the complete opposite when out of power. More importantly, people should be convinced the agendas and demands of political forces are genuine. It is unfortunate that over the past decade, people have come to believe that the Madhesh-based parties are more than willing to trade their agenda for Cabinet seats. Their image has taken a nosedive, as is reflected in recent election results. The role of strong regional forces is important in the federal system we have adopted. However, the country’s regional parties are getting weaker due to divisions. A few months after a group led by Ashok Rai split the Upendra Yadav-led Janata Samajbadi Party-Nepal, a former Loktantrik Samajbadi Party leader Rajendra Mahato announced another new outfit on Tuesday. Madheshis are not impressed. They have some valid demands but they need credible political outfits to champion them.  \nThere is no doubt that the promulgation of the Constitution of Nepal, 2015, nine years ago, was a significant accomplishment. That was primarily because it represented the realisation of the decades-old national dream of being governed by a constitution drafted by a sovereign body elected by the people of Nepal. Due to its “fast-tracked” provenance, the kind of deliberations that would have granted it much greater legitimacy was sorely missing. Even so, it was a milestone in Nepal’s history.That momentous achievement was, however, marred by the somewhat contradictory turn of events in that it was adopted in the face of opposition by a large section of the populace, particularly from the Tarai. While the royalist Rastriya Prajatantra Party had expectedly voted against the republican and secular constitution, all the Madhesh-based parties had boycotted the proceedings altogether. The main grouse of the latter was the delineation of provincial boundaries, but there were also strong misgivings over the distribution of parliamentary constituencies as well as restrictions on the right of women to pass citizenship to their offspring.The whys and the whereforesWith the political space heating up amidst talk of amending the constitution following the Nepali Congress-UML pact, we appear to be headed for another round of acrimony. As per the two-party agreement, the express purpose of the amendment would be to identify the constitution’s “strengths and weaknesses and complexities that have emerged in practice” which have contributed to Nepal’s chronic political instability. Party leaders have been clear that their main target is the current mixed electoral system, particularly proportional representation (PR), which they are more than quite certain is the primary cause for the never-ending making and breaking of governments. It is a different matter that our own experience from the 1990s clearly indicates otherwise, and other countries that have adopted PR have not been similarly blighted by the kind of instability that has become the hallmark of Nepali politics.Beyond that, given the two parties’ record, there was immediate suspicion that they would try to do away with some of the more progressive elements of the constitution. The Nepali Congress leader, Sher Bahadur Deuba, has in the past hinted secularism could be up for negotiation. And while Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli has maintained that any amendment would lead to an even more liberal document, given his earlier stance on issues such as inclusion and devolution of provincial authority, there are reasons aplenty to consider his assertion with a block of salt.Besides the political parties, there have been similar calls from the judicial sector as well. Two prominent recently retired Supreme Court justices who had both served on the court’s constitutional bench have spelt out the need for amendments. Anand Mohan Bhattarai believes that it should begin with the political leadership first identifying where the bottlenecks are. The second jurist, Ishwor Khatiwada, goes further and argues that each and every article of the constitution should be up for review, albeit for the purpose of improving them and not to fulfil the interests of any political party. The latter, obviously, is the crux of the problem. Without doubt, there will be some fiddling with the constitution; it is only a question of when, not if.Self-inquiry before self-interest Now that he is out of office, the Maoist supremo, Pushpa Kamal Dahal Prachanda, has suddenly felt the need to re-embrace the agenda that propelled him to power but which he had lost sight of in his extended romp in the nation’s highest offices. Thus, he says that his party would be amenable to constitutional amendments provided there are no “attempts to shrink the rights of the citizens and dismiss the achievements in the name of the constitution amendment”.Perhaps, it was the still-muted pushback that prompted Deuba to clarify that the provinces would remain, and instead, the focus would be on strengthening the provincial structure. He also said that many groups in the country will have to be provided with proportional representation in governance structure. “This country belongs to everyone,” he said somewhat sagely.The hard sell, of course, will be to the Madhesh-based parties. For instance, the president of the Tarai Madhesh Loktantrik Party, Brikhesh Chandra Lal, writes that the move by the ruling coalition could be a cover for “extreme nationalism” which would ultimately negate sub-national identities. He believes such a move “could increase the possibility of the country getting stuck in a permanent conflict”. Conflict does not necessarily mean violence, but the kind of upheaval Lal warns about will have the same deleterious effect overall. Hence, the need to tread carefully and take all sides into confidence instead of ramming through amendments on the basis of parliamentary strength.I do not think the NC-UML combine would opt for a path of confrontation. Going back to Deuba, we can take heart in his words that there was no need to distrust them since both parties have emerged out of the struggle for democracy. “Personally, I first met him [Oli] in jail. We have both fought for democracy. As parties that fought for democracy throughout our student life and jail experiences, there is no way we can go against democracy.”One can read something in his use of the now-discredited “prajatantra” to refer to democracy instead of the more-favoured “loktrantra”. But it could easily just have been a momentary lapse, attributable to his advanced age.Age did not hamper someone else in lucid expression though. In the summer of 1787, at the end of the rather raucous convention that drafted the American constitution, 81-year-old Benjamin Franklin, by then the elder statesman in the room, made a statement that rings true for all time: “I confess that there are several parts of this constitution which I do not at present approve, but I am not sure I shall never approve them: For having lived long, I have experienced many instances of being obliged by better information, or fuller consideration, to change opinions even on important subjects, which I once thought right, but found to be otherwise. It is therefore that the older I grow, the more apt I am to doubt my own judgment, and to pay more respect to the judgment of others.”Those wise words should guide our politicians even as they begin discussions on changes to the constitution. We can only hope that they are capable of the same humility borne out of a lifetime of self-enquiry that Franklin articulated so eloquently. \nAs a child growing up in the early 1990s, I remember learning in school about the greenhouse effect. Carbon dioxide released by burning fossil fuels traps heat near the Earth’s surface, like the glass of a greenhouse. I imagined myself on the playground, roasting inside a humid hothouse.Fast forward 30 years, and the terms have changed.For a while, “global warming” was the go-to expression for talking about rising global temperatures and the role of human activities, particularly the use of fossil fuels. It had a spike in internet searches in 2007, probably due to former Vice President Al Gore’s documentary “An Inconvenient Truth: A Global Warning,” which hit theatres in 2006.Near the end of the Obama administration, “climate change” became the most common term. It’s now trending in Google searches more than global warming. Both terms make the same point: Rising global temperatures have major consequences on local weather patterns and worldwide climate effects, including stronger hurricanes, droughts, floods and fires.Trending termsGoogle Trends tracks the relative popularity of internet search terms over time. The popularity of the term \"global warming\" has declined globally in recent years, while \"climate change\" has risen.However, the words we use to discuss these effects can make a large difference in how people understand the risks and the need for more sustainable choices.What’s in a name?I’m a linguistics researcher currently living on Mayotte Island, off the coast of Madagascar, where I study climate change knowledge among local populations and the language they use to discuss it.Local fishers in Mayotte struggle to talk about the phenomenon because there is no established terminology for it. What my colleagues and I have learned offers some insight into the difficulties people in many cultures have with understanding climate change.In the grand scheme of climate change education and sustainability efforts, this seemingly minor problem of translation is in fact symptomatic of a larger underlying issue regarding the relationship between humans and their environment.In fact, when we dig deeper into the challenges of communicating climate change across cultures, two factors come into play: spiritual beliefs and notions of time.Spiritual language can overlapSpiritual and religious beliefs can play an important role in how climate change is understood and even named. For example, the translation for the term climate in Inuktitut, an Inuit language spoken in Canada, is “sila.” However, sila also refers to wisdom, the spirit, the earth, and the universe. It is something sacred to be revered.Seen through the lens of this second set of definitions, sila is effectively impossible for people to influence. It is beyond humankind’s reach to change the cosmos. As a result, communication aimed at promoting awareness of climate change becomes politicised in Eastern Canadian Inuit languages.My colleagues and I encountered similar challenges while discussing possible future efforts to slow down environmental destruction caused by climate change in Mayotte.The Maore fishers we interviewed, many of whom were of deep Islamic faith, often responded with “Inshallah,” or God willing, when questioned about efforts the community could make in the future to address the problem. They saw these climate change-related events as out of their hands, as something only God could interfere with.Different understanding of timeSecond, we might think that time is objective and therefore shared across cultures. But as Albert Einstein argued, time is relative.Time is not only relative scientifically speaking but also culturally. For example, the ancient Greeks had more than three types of time, one of which we still use today, Kronos, or linear time—think chronological order. We have all but forgotten Aion, or sacred, eternal time, and Kairos, or cyclical time.Notions of time play an important role when thinking about climate change since the heart of the phenomenon involves a slow, continuous change over a long period. We cannot see climate change happen with the naked eye, because it occurs over years and decades. Of course, we can see its effects on weather patterns, including extreme heat waves and heavy downpours.Getting people to think about time in a way that simultaneously thinks about the now, and a “then” in the distant future proves to be challenging in many cultures.For example, researchers studying sustainability efforts in the Maldives Islands have come up against this very issue. While discussing time, many local residents think in terms of the now and the near future, whereas policymakers must think about longer-term effects on a larger scale. These contrasting approaches to time have made it difficult to put into place sustainability efforts to tackle rising sea levels—a significant threat to this tropical nation of 26 atolls.Translating climate changeA first step to confronting this problem is to put language at the forefront of climate change education efforts.One youth-driven nonprofit making strides in this area is Climate Cardinals. The group’s objective is to translate climate change research into as many languages as possible. Most scientific studies and reports are in English, which can be a barrier to the many non-English speakers around the globe. In their efforts to translate this research and related phenomena, they need to think carefully about how important words are translated and understood.The United Nations and other groups are also starting to take seriously the connection between climate change scepticism and religion, including the need to reconcile eventual points of friction.For example, the Faith for Earth Initiative works with religious organisations to address the compatibility of sustainability efforts and faith. It does this by helping religious leaders connect core spiritual values, like caring and rejection of greed, to the community’s environment, thus reconnecting with nature and seeing themselves as its stewards.Finally, it is imperative to keep studying local or indigenous knowledge about the environment as related to change and time. The ancient Greeks certainly had their reasons for dividing time into multiple categories. So what were the environmental and historical influences that led them to do so?For instance, researchers and community members in Australia are looking to reconcile Indigenous knowledge with Western science. Thanks to the locals’ long-standing observations of their environment over several generations, they were able to identify local effects of climate change. Such information is often overlooked and difficult to obtain by traditional research methods.Beyond the headlinesClimate change awareness and sustainability efforts will only increase over time. Care needs to be taken to how these concepts are lived, understood and talked about in non-Western settings. Language is part and parcel of these efforts and deserves to be considered more carefully.-The Conversation Read the original article here. \nAccess to quality education in Nepal's rural areas is hindered by a severe shortage of qualified teachers, particularly in science and math, leading to a lack of students and compromised education outcomes.\nIsrael bombed southern Lebanon on Thursday and said it had thwarted an Iranian-led assassination plot, a day after explosions of Hezbollah radios that came on the heels of blasts in booby trapped pagers, setting the foes hurtling towards war.The sophisticated attacks on armed group Hezbollah's communications equipment, which killed 37 people and wounded around 3,000 over two days, sowed disarray in Lebanon, with panicked residents abandoning their mobile phones.\"This isn’t a small matter, it’s war. Who can even secure their phone now? When I heard about what happened yesterday, I left my phone on my motorcycle and walked away,\" said Mustafa Sibal on a street near central Beirut.A distant roar in the skies could be heard in Beirut from what Lebanese state media said was Israeli jets breaking the sound barrier - a sound that has grown increasingly common in recent months.Israel said its warplanes struck villages in southern Lebanon overnight, and a security source and Hezbollah's al-Manar TV reported airstrikes near the border resumed on Thursday just after midday.Hand-held radios used by Hezbollah detonated on Wednesday across Lebanon's south. The Lebanese health minister raised the death toll, saying 25 people had been killed and 608 injured in the country's deadliest day since cross-border fighting erupted between the militants and Israel in parallel with the Gaza war last year.The previous day, hundreds of pagers - used by Hezbollah to evade mobile phone surveillance - exploded at once, killing 12 people including two children, and injuring more than 2,300.In a post on X, Lebanese Prime Minister Najib Mikati called on the United Nations Security Council to take a firm stand to stop Israel's \"aggression\" and \"technological war\" against his country.Israel has not commented directly on the booby-trapped walkie-talkies and pagers, but multiple security sources have said the attacks were carried out by its spy agency Mossad.Israel says its conflict with Hezbollah, like its war in Gaza against Palestinian militant group Hamas, is part of a wider regional confrontation with Iran, which sponsors both groups as well as armed movements in Syria, Yemen and Iraq.On Thursday Israeli security forces announced that an Israeli businessman had been arrested last month after attending at least two meetings in Iran, where he discussed assassinating Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, the defence minister or the head of the Shin Bet spy agency.Last week, Shin Bet uncovered what it said was a plot by Hezbollah to assassinate former Defence Minister Moshe Ya'alon.Israel has been accused of assassinations including a blast in Tehran that killed the leader of Hamas and another in a Beirut suburb that killed a senior Hezbollah commander within hours of each other in July.Despite the events of the past few days, a spokesperson for the U.N. peacekeeping mission in southern Lebanon said the situation along the frontier had \"not changed much in terms of exchanges of fire between the parties\".\"There was an intensification last week. This week it is more or less the same. There are still exchanges of fire. It is still worrying, still concerning, and the rhetoric is high,\" the spokesperson, Andrea Tenenti, told Reuters.Israel and Hezbollah have been exchanging fire across the Israeli-Lebanon border in parallel with the war Israel has waged in Gaza against Hamas, the Palestinian militant group whose fighters attacked Israel on Oct. 7.Tens of thousands of people have had to flee the Israel-Lebanon border area on both sides. Netanyahu vowed on Wednesday to return the evacuated Israelis \"securely to their homes\".SHIFTING FOCUSThe Israeli military said its overnight air strikes hit Hezbollah targets in Chihine, Tayibe, Blida, Meiss El Jabal, Aitaroun and Kfarkela in southern Lebanon, as well as a Hezbollah weapons storage facility in the area of Khiam.Israeli media reported that a number of Israeli civilians had been wounded by anti-tank missile fire from Lebanon, but there was no official confirmation.On Wednesday, Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant said the war was moving into a new phase, with more resources and military units now being shifted to the northern border.According to Israeli officials, the forces being deployed there include the 98th Division, an elite formation including commando and paratroop elements that has been fighting in Gaza.Hezbollah launched missile barrages on Israel on the day after the Oct. 7 attack by Hamas, and since then there has been a constant exchange of fire that neither side has allowed to escalate into a full-scale war.However, tens of thousands have been evacuated on both sides of the border, and there has been mounting pressure in Israel for the government to get the evacuees back home. \nNorwegian human rights foundation awards jailed Cuban dissident leader Luis Manuel Otero Alcantara the Rafto Prize for his anti-authoritarian art, calling for his release from a 5-year sentence.\nA child enrolled in a Japanese school in the Chinese city of Shenzhen has died after being stabbed on Wednesday, officials confirmed on Thursday, the second such attack near Japanese educational centres in China in recent months.Chinese authorities said the 10-year-old boy was a Japanese national born to a Japanese father and a Chinese mother, and he had been stabbed on his way to school at about 8 AM on Wednesday by a 44-year-old assailant surnamed Zhong.He died in the early hours of Thursday, Japanese foreign minister Yoko Kamikawa told reporters in Tokyo.“Medical experts made every effort to save his life, and the Chinese side will provide the necessary assistance to his family to take care of his affairs,” Lin Jian, a Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson, told a regular news conference in Beijing.“According to the information currently available, this is an individual case and such incidents could occur in any country,” he added.On Thursday afternoon, people laid wreaths at the gates of the school in Shenzhen’s affluent Shekou area, which is home to most of the city’s foreign community and international schools.“As Chinese people, we oppose this behaviour, we oppose teachings of hatred,” said one man who identified himself as an ordinary Shenzhen resident.“Many of us have been under such teachings of hate for a long time, leading to such evil consequences,” he added. The attack took place on the anniversary of an incident in 1931 that triggered war between China and Japan, a sensitive date at a time when diplomatic relations are in danger of deteriorating.“I actually did not know 18th September was this day for Chinese people to take revenge for things in the Second World War,” said a Japanese father of two children in Shenzhen, who asked to only be identified by his surname, Suzuki, out of safety concerns.“I have lived here for seven years and did not know we need to be cautious for being Japanese while living in China.”Japan has asked China to provide a detailed explanation of the facts and to take strong safety measures, Kamikawa told reporters earlier in the day.“I take the incident extremely seriously,” she added.“This should never happen in any country. Particularly, I sincerely regret that this despicable act was committed against a child on their way to school.”The local Japanese chamber of commerce has asked the Japanese government to ensure the safety of its nationals in the area, the organisation said in a statement.It was the second such attack near a Japanese educational facility in China in recent months. In June, a man attacked a bus used by a Japanese school in the eastern city of Suzhou, resulting in the death of a Chinese national who tried to shield a Japanese mother and her child from the assailant. \nPeace talks between Colombia's government and the ELN rebel group have been halted after an attack killed two soldiers, prompting the government to call for a demonstration of peace from the ELN to resume negotiations.\nDifferent countries have congratulated Nepal on Construction Day.In a message to President Ramchandra Paudel, British King Charles conveyed heartfelt congratulations to the President and the Nepali on the occasion.“I value the bond between our nations and hope that our countries can continue to work closely together on important global issues, whether they be peace and prosperity or environment and climate change, which will benefit future generations for years to come,” said Charles.“My wife and I would like to take this opportunity to send you and all Nepalis our warmest good wishes for the coming year.”In an official statement, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken extended greetings to Nepalis on behalf of the US government.“The United States greatly values our 77 years of friendship with Nepal. We are proud of our joint efforts to strengthen people-to-people ties, boost economic growth through initiatives like the debt-free partnership with the Millennium Challenge Corporation, promote justice, and uphold democratic principles,” said Blinken.“We remain committed to working with Nepal to increase its climate resilience and advance its transition to clean energy. We look forward to our continued close collaboration in the future.”Blinken said it is also an important moment to recognise many of Nepal’s achievements, including the recent passage of historic transitional justice legislation, and we look forward to its successful implementation bringing justice for victims and survivors.Likewise, the European Union has extended best wishes to the government and people of Nepal on Constitution Day.“The European Union in Nepal remains committed to supporting Nepal’s journey towards a more democratic, inclusive, and prosperous future. Together, we can achieve great things,” the Delegation of the European Union to Nepal said in a post on X.Similarly, Australian ambassador to Nepal Leann Johnston, in a post on X, said Australia sends its warmest wishes to the government and people of Nepal on Constitution Day. \nMinister for Foreign Affairs Arzu Rana and her Canadian counterpart Mélanie Joly held bilateral talks in Ottawa on Wednesday.According to Minister Rana's secretariat, the discussion focused on strengthening Nepal-Canada relations, mutual interests, economic investments, and partnerships.Minister Rana is in Canada to attend the Women Foreign Ministers' Meeting.During their meeting, the two ministers discussed the diplomatic relations established in 1965 and expressed satisfaction with the strong ties between the two nations. Rana appreciated Canada’s support for Nepal’s democratic process and constitution-building efforts. She informed the Canadian minister that Nepal’s Parliament recently passed an amendment bill to the transitional justice law, marking a significant step towards completing the peace process.The foreign minister also thanked Canada for its support during challenging times, such as the 2015 earthquake and the Covid-19 pandemic. Her secretariat said she acknowledged Canada's long-standing economic assistance and its role as a development partner for Nepal.Likewise, Minister Rana urged Canada to establish an embassy in Nepal, citing the growing number of Nepali students studying in Canada and the increasing number of Canadian tourists visiting Nepal. She highlighted the need for further cooperation in various sectors, including research, business, and hydropower, where Canada has extensive experience.“The two foreign ministers also underlined the importance of cooperation in international forums in the agendas of shared interest, such as promoting multilateralism, addressing climate change and implementing the sustainable development goals,” stated a press release issued by the Embassy of Nepal in Ottawa after the meeting between the two ministers.Minister Rana also emphasised Nepal’s contributions to UN peacekeeping missions, noting that 2,554 Nepali women have served, with 608 currently deployed.The two ministers agreed to hold further bilateral talks in Kathmandu this December.According to Minister Rana’s secretariat, Canada has agreed to continue supporting women’s empowerment in Nepal and collaborate on its ‘Feminist Foreign Policy’. Canadian Foreign Minister Joly encouraged Nepal to work together on this initiative and praised Nepal’s recent progress in inclusivity and women’s rights.Joly also expressed Canada’s readiness to support Nepal through the Canadian Pension Fund and responded positively to Foreign Minister Rana’s proposal to establish a Canadian embassy in Nepal.Minister Joly highlighted the increasing presence of Nepalis in Canada, praising them for their honesty and dedication to work. She reaffirmed Canada’s commitment to assisting Nepal in women’s empowerment, pledging support for establishing a women’s university and promoting girls’ education.Additionally, Joly welcomed Minister Rana’s proposal for cooperation in e-governance, expressing willingness to move forward with mutual collaboration. On the occasion, Minister Rana invited Minister Joly to visit Nepal. Earlier, Foreign Minister Rana met with the chair and members of the Canada-Nepal Parliamentary Friendship Group. According to a statement from Nepal’s foreign ministry, Sonia Sidhu, chair of the parliamentary group and a Member of Parliament, expressed her pleasure at hosting the first official visit by a Nepali foreign minister to Canada.Both sides reviewed the strong ties between the parliaments of Nepal and Canada, underscoring the importance of promoting regular exchanges and sharing experiences between the parliamentarians of both nations. They also expressed satisfaction with the growing people-to-people relations and acknowledged the valuable contributions of the Nepali diaspora in strengthening this bond. \nTwo people died in a motorcycle accident in ward 6 of Lamahi Municipality along the Lamahi-Ghorahi road section early Thursday morning.The motorcycle, heading from Lamahi to Ghorahi, overturned, causing fatalities, according to police.The deceased are 22-year-old Shrawan Kumar Pun of Ghorahi Sub-Metropolitan City-18, who was the motorcyclist, and 21-year-old Vinod KC of Ghorahi-4, who was the pillion rider.Both victims were transported to Lamahi Hospital, where they were pronounced dead by the attending doctors.Deputy Superintendent of Police Ram Prasad Timilsina, spokesperson for the District Police Office, Dang, said an investigation into the accident is underway. \nNorth Korea tested new tactical ballistic missiles using super-large warheads and modified cruise missiles on Wednesday as leader Kim Jong Un called for stronger conventional weapons and nuclear capabilities, state news agency KCNA reported.The tests to improve weapons capabilities are required because of the grave threat posed by outside forces to the security of the country, Kim, who led the tests, was quoted as saying.The account followed the firing of multiple short-range ballistic missiles on Wednesday reported by the South Korean military, which was the second time the North test-launched missiles in a week.Last week, North Korea also unveiled a uranium enrichment facility, in its first such public report.Kim stressed “the need to continue to bolster up the nuclear force and have the strongest military technical capability and overwhelming offensive capability in the field of conventional weapons too,” KCNA said.Wednesday’s tests involved the new tactical ballistic Hwasongpho-11-Da-4.5 missiles, KCNA said, indicating it was part of a series of short-range ballistic missiles it had been developing.The missile was mounted with a 4.5-ton super-large conventional warhead, KCNA said.North Korea’s state media reported the tests of missiles with the same name in July, which was considered a partial success. On Thursday, state media released photographs of a projectile striking a target in a hilly area.South Korea’s military said on Thursday two ballistic missiles landed in a mountainous area in the North’s northeast.Such a missile launch test with an intention to hit an inland target is likely unprecedented, said Shin Seung-ki who is the head of research on North Korea’s military at the state-run Korea Institute for Defense Analyses in Seoul.North Korea routinely test-launches missiles to drop in the sea or on an uninhabited island.The particular missile with the Hwasongpho-11-Da-4.5 designation is still under development but Russia may want it soon if its performance and reliability can be guaranteed through further testing, Shin said.“North Korea will want to shorten that time as much as possible,” he said.Kyiv officials and independent experts have said there were signs some of the missiles used by Russia in the war against Ukraine were North Korean-made, including some that were produced this year. Moscow and Pyongyang both deny any illicit arms trade or shipments.The North’s military also tested a strategic cruise missile that has been upgraded for combat use, KCNA said.North Korea has criticized military drills by the South Korean and U.S. militaries, including a large-scale exercise conducted this summer, as preparations for war on the Korean peninsula.The allies say the drills are defensive in nature and aimed at maintaining readiness against any North Korean aggression. \nHand-held radios used by armed group Hezbollah detonated on Wednesday across Lebanon’s south in the country’s deadliest day since cross-border fighting erupted between the militants and Israel nearly a year ago, stoking tensions after similar explosions of the group’s pagers the day before.Lebanon’s health ministry said 20 people were killed and more than 450 injured on Wednesday in Beirut’s suburbs and the Bekaa Valley, while the death toll from Tuesday’s explosions rose to 12, including two children, with nearly 3,000 injured.Israeli officials have not commented on the blasts, but security sources said Israel’s spy agency Mossad was responsible. One Hezbollah official said the episode was the biggest security breach in the group’s history.The operations, which appeared to throw Hezbollah into disarray, played out alongside Israel’s 11-month-old war in Gaza and heightened fears of an escalation on its Lebanese border and the risk of a full-blown regional war.“We are opening a new phase in the war. It requires courage, determination and perseverance from us,” Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant said in remarks at an air force base.Jordan’s Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi accused Israel of pushing the Middle East to the brink of a regional war by orchestrating a dangerous escalation on many fronts.The US, which denied any involvement in the blasts, said it was pursuing intensive diplomacy to avert an escalation of the conflict. A US official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Israel told Washington on Tuesday it was going to do something in Lebanon. But Israel did not provide details and the operation itself was a surprise to Washington, the official said.At least one of Wednesday’s blasts in Lebanon took place near a funeral organised by Iran-backed Hezbollah for those killed the previous day when thousands of the group’s pagers exploded across the country and wounded many of its fighters.A Reuters reporter in the southern suburbs of Beirut said he saw Hezbollah members frantically taking batteries out of any walkie-talkies that had not exploded, tossing the parts in metal barrels. Hezbollah turned to pagers and other low-tech communication devices in an attempt to evade Israeli surveillance of mobile phones.Lebanon’s Red Cross said on X that it responded with 30 ambulance teams to multiple explosions in different areas, including the south of Lebanon and the Bekaa Valley.Images of the exploded walkie-talkies showed labels with “ICOM” and “made in Japan.” According to its website, ICOM, which did not immediately reply to a request for comment, is a Japan-based radio communications and telephone company.The company has said that production of model IC-V82, which appeared to be the model in the images, was phased out in 2014.The hand-held radios were purchased by Hezbollah five months ago, around the same time as the pagers, a security source said.In Tuesday’s explosions, sources said Israeli spies remotely detonated explosives they planted in a Hezbollah order of 5,000 pagers before they entered the country.The United Nations Security Council will meet on Friday about the pager blasts after a request by Arab states.Tehran’s ambassador in Lebanon was superficially injured in Tuesday’s blasts, Iran’s semi-official Fars news agency reported then. But the New York Times on Wednesday said he lost one eye and the other was severely injured when a pager he was carrying exploded, citing two members of Iran’s Revolutionary Guard.Iran’s envoy to the U.N. said in a letter on Wednesday that it “reserves its rights under international law to take required measures deemed necessary to respond” to the attack.HEZBOLLAH LAUNCHES ROCKETSHezbollah, which has vowed to retaliate against Israel, said on Wednesday it attacked Israeli artillery positions with rockets, the first strike at its arch-foe since the blasts. The Israeli military said there were no reports of any damage or casualties.“Hezbollah wants to avoid an all-out war,” said Mohanad Hage Ali, deputy director of research at the Carnegie Middle East Center in Beirut. “But given the scale ... there will be pressure for a stronger response.”The two sides have been fighting across the Lebanese border since the Gaza conflict erupted on Oct. 7, 2023, fuelling fears of a wider Middle East war that could drag in the United States and Iran. The previous highest daily Lebanese death toll was 11 who died in Israeli shelling last month, according to official counts.Gallant said Israel, which has vowed to return evacuated residents to their homes in the north, was transferring troops and resources to the Lebanon border region. Israeli sources said this included the army’s 98th Division, which has commando and paratrooper formations, moving from Gaza to the north.“The ‘centre of gravity’ is moving north, meaning that we are allocating forces, resources and energy for the northern arena,” Gallant said in remarks released by his office.A full-blown war with Israel could devastate Lebanon, which has lurched from one crisis to another, including a 2019 financial collapse and the 2020 Beirut port blast.Rising tensions may also complicate so far unsuccessful efforts by mediators Egypt, Qatar and the U.S. to negotiate a Gaza ceasefire between Israel and militant group Hamas, a Hezbollah ally also backed by Iran.White House national security spokesperson John Kirby said on Wednesday it was too soon to assess the impact of the blasts on ceasefire talks.Hezbollah, Iran’s most powerful proxy in the Middle East, said in a statement it would continue to support Hamas in Gaza and Israel should await a response to the pager “massacre.”A Hamas delegation visited people wounded in the blasts in Lebanese hospitals on Wednesday, Lebanese state news agency NNA said.The explosions followed a series of assassinations of Hezbollah and Hamas commanders and leaders ascribed to Israel since the start of the Gaza war. \nGeopolitical conflicts and tensions are fuelling a surge of economic fragmentation and protectionism around the world, which would hit poor nations in particular, experts warn. In addition, there is a climate crisis, which would require huge amounts of money to cushion the shocks.But who will fund it?The Horizons Dialogue series, organised by the British Embassy and UK International Development in Kathmandu on Wednesday, brought together national and international experts to discuss the challenges and opportunities in Nepal’s development in the next ten years amid geopolitical conflicts and growing climate crisis. Experts have warned that the geopolitical conflict's repercussions could cause Nepal to lose foreign grants, loans, and other support.“We [Nepal] have seen a decline in international cooperation after the Covid-19 pandemic, the Russia-Ukraine war and conflict in the Middle-East countries,” said Kalpana Khanal, senior research fellow leading the Center for Economic and Infrastructure Development Policy at the Policy Research Institute. She was speaking on the theme ‘Navigating Nepal’s Fragility’.Khanal said, “The world is experiencing violence, interstate wars, and economic turbulence, with some countries adopting more anti-globalisation policies and populist regimes. This could cause a decline in international cooperation.”What will happen then? Khanal explained that such a scenario would force Nepal to focus on revenue collection to repay loans and interest rather than funding critical projects.“Currently, Nepal is channelling 22 percent of its total revenue towards debt servicing. In such a situation, if we do not receive the grant and rely more on loans, it will hinder overall development,” said Khanal.Nepal's public debt is 43 percent of its total GDP, half of which is made up of external loans and support.“We can potentially face a decline in international cooperation, as global lenders and development partners may channel funds towards the war-ridden countries like Ukraine and Palestine,” Khanal said.Khanal said climate change, amid geopolitical tension, may hamper projects built with foreign loans. “Many of the ongoing hydropower projects in Nepal rely on foreign loans. The devastating floods and landslides due to extreme weather conditions increase the project's costs. This, too, impacts public debt,” Khanal said.The global war will bring not only disaster but also hunger.Khanal said Nepal’s food inflation increased sharply after the Covid-19 pandemic and the Russia-Ukraine war. “It’s high time the country focused on food security.”According to a report prepared by the organisers, over the next decade, changes in the demand for Nepali workers, particularly in India and the Middle East, or geopolitical events that limit labour migration could have major impacts on the national development trajectory.Climate change, disasters, and health crises could also have significant economic impacts. In recent years, disruptions to agriculture from droughts and floods have led to sharp rises in food prices, the report said.Nearly 60 percent of Nepal’s population relies on agriculture, and two-thirds of that group is engaged in subsistence farming. The report said that, as a result of male outmigration, women constitute 73 percent of the agricultural workforce.Over the past decades, air quality has significantly deteriorated, consistently exceeding the World Health Organization's limits. The participants say that without significant intervention, it is likely to deteriorate further in the next five years.“But hopefully, in 10 years, we have projected some improvement in some areas,” said Arun Bhakta Shrestha, senior climate change specialist and programme manager for the Regional River Basins and Cryosphere programme of International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development (ICIMOD).Air pollution in the Kathmandu valley and the Tarai presents a growing health crisis, with around 12 percent of Kathmandu’s population suffering from chronic respiratory diseases like asthma and pneumonia, threatening to reverse reductions in infant and child mortality, the report said.Air pollution hazards will be worsened by more frequent hydrometeorological events such as droughts and heatwaves, with huge knock-on effects for the health of the population, the report said.Comparing the National Board of Diseases report of Nepal between 2011 and 2021, in 2011, malnutrition was the number one cause of death but now it's air pollution. Over 20 percent of deaths are now caused by air pollution in Nepal, which is around 42,000 deaths annually, said Dr Meghnath Dhimal, an environmental health scientist and chief research officer at Nepal Health Research Council.As South Asia is suffering from heat waves, which increase non-communicable diseases, many people are now using more chemicals than before because once the temperature goes high, the effectiveness of the insecticide goes down, Dhimal said. “As a result, more people are suffering from cancer, diabetes, malaises, and others,” he said.Climate change, air pollution, and bio-diseases may result in the epidemic of the non-communicable disease. As climate change and air pollution all cause non-communicable diseases, this share may go up to 90 percent in the next five to ten years, Dhimal said.Rob Fenn, the British ambassador to Nepal, said, “As the world grapples with climate change, Nepal is bearing the brunt despite contributing very little to global emissions.”It is vital that global action supports Nepal’s resilience and growth, Fenn said. “The UK will remain a reliable partner in helping Nepal recover from shocks, adapt to challenges, and thrive,” he said.“Our programmes will continue to invest in climate resilience, sustainable economic growth, and health systems that serve all communities.”  \n\nOn September 1, on the final day of the Nepali Congress Central Working Committee meeting, General Secretary Bishwa Prakash Sharma explicitly urged Sher Bahadur Deuba, the party president, to give up his aspirations to be the prime minister yet again.As per the seven-point agreement between the Congress and the CPN-UML on July 1, UML Chairman KP Sharma Oli, the incumbent prime minister, will lead the government for the first two years. Then Congress chief Deuba will lead the government until the elections in November-December 2027. Sharma urged Deuba to leave the prime minister’s post for another senior Congress leader. Deuba reportedly rejected the proposal outright.“I will not give up the position just because someone so desires,” Deuba reportedly said in response.Sharma, one of the two general secretaries of the country’s oldest political party, had proposed an exit policy in his contemporary political proposal tabled at the Mahasamiti meeting in February for the leaders holding state positions such as president, prime minister, ministers.Besides Sharma's proposal, the Mahasamiti also endorsed the papers submitted by Vice-president Purna Bahadur Khadka and General Secretary Gagan Thapa. However, it also gave room for the central committee to modify the proposal. When the central committee approved Khadka’s policy proposal and Thapa’s organisational proposal with minor changes, Sharma’s paper was pushed back to be considered while amending the national constitution.Sharma proposed one term for the [country’s] President, two terms for the prime minister, three terms for ministers, and four terms for lawmakers. Sharma’s proposal on term limits on persons serving as the country’s president or the prime minister is a national rather than the party’s issue, so it has been deferred, according to party leaders. Most of the Congress central leaders who spoke at the meeting, which lasted almost a month with gaps in between, claimed that fixing a time limit for the leadership was contrary to the democratic principle that the party champions.UML chief whip Mahesh Bartaula also says that since politics is a voluntary job, the politicians should be able to contribute to the society for as long as they want. “Nonetheless, the exit policy proposal is thought-provoking,” Bartaula told the Post. As a new generation of leaders is yet to be fully developed, the public still trusts the older crop of leaders, he argues. “Those vying for top positions are yet to gain the public’s credibility.”For Krishna Pokharel, a professor of political science, it would be unnatural to amend the constitution to address Sharma’s demand. “In countries where people directly elect their prime minister, amending the constitution to limit the executive head’s term could be reasonable” Pokharel told the Post. “However, in a country like Nepal where the parties choose the prime minister, exit policy should rather be mentioned in the party’s statute.” Had Nepali leaders internalised the spirit of the parliamentary system, their entry and exit points need not have been discussed. “The parliamentary system in Nepal has been vulgarised,” Pokharel added. According to political experts, despite the Congress leaders criticising the exit policy at the central committee, the proposal’s public appeal is growing. They see no alternative to its implementation, sooner or later. One reason for growing public disenchantment with political parties is that the same old faces have continued in leadership positions for a long time. If there were a term limit for a leader in a governmental or party position, people’s dissatisfaction would somehow be addressed.Experts say the recent political upheaval in Bangladesh and the political crisis of Sri Lanka two years ago were due to the continuous rule by a single person or a single family.One reason some democracies struggle is their political leaders’ unlimited hunger for power, Uddab Pyakurel, a political analyst, told the Post. “In Nordic countries, there is no need to set term limits for leaders as there is already a strong democratic culture there.” Despite having leaders like Donald Trump, American democracy still works, partly because of the term limits, Pyakurel reasoned. “If Nepal is to strengthen its democratic system, it must implement the exit policy for political leaders,” he said. Some political experts see problems even after introducing a term limit.Arguing that limiting the tenure for top positions alone is not enough to put curbs on autocratic tendencies, Khagendra Prasai, another political analyst, said: “The major issue is developing political mannerism and culture.”Calls for the top party leadership making way for a new generation are growing not just in the Congress. Even during the CPN (Maoist Centre) standing committee meeting last month, Deputy General Secretary Janardan Sharma questioned Pushpa Kamal Dahal’s uninterrupted leadership for nearly 35 years. Sharma even urged Dahal to resign the position. Experts say leaders with limited terms realise they must get a lot done within the given time at the top. There is no slow cooldown period. The current set of top party leaders—Deuba, Oli and Dahal in particular—have been in power for two or three decades, repeatedly assuming the country’s top executive position. Article 216 (7) of the Constitution of Nepal says a person elected mayor for two terms will not be eligible to be a candidate in future municipal elections. Article 215 (7) has a similar provision for chairpersons of rural municipalities.The constitution also has a two-term limit for President.While all other top governing posts come with fixed terms, there are limits on how many times the prime minister, chief ministers, ministers, and lawmakers can serve. This allows politicians to occupy office for as long as they choose, preventing the leadership handover to the next generation. In the view of Mighendra Bahadur Karki, executive director of the Centre for Nepal and Asia Studies (CNAS) at Tribhuvan University: “Leaders who know that their peers, even junior colleagues, may someday be their supervisors may be more thoughtful of their behaviour. Poor behaviour and status anxiety might be reduced, increasing the room for collaboration.” If senior leaders know that they need to bow out of the government or the party after a particular time, they are more likely to train and promote junior leaders to take their place, Karki told the Post. “This in turn will cultivate a healthy political culture.”But he warned that the question of term limit is not straightforward. “The exit policy, if it is to be implemented, should be system-centric rather than targeting particular leaders.” \nEven in the era of the meteoric rise of ultra-right politics globally, Nepal is among a few countries whose politics is dominated by socialists of different shades. From democratic socialists to moderate Leftists to Marxists and Bolsheviks to Bolivarans, all dream of establishing a classless society under a single-party dictatorship. Not being a socialist in this country is a political sacrilege and, ostensibly, becoming anti-development, if not outrightly anti-national. Nevertheless, almost all of these pipe dreamers have accepted the “mainstream” adult franchise-based parliamentary democracy.Not being socialist also (perhaps) goes against the Constitution. This is because, in at least three instances, The Constitution of Nepal 2015 categorically mentions the term “socialism” while defining the nature of the Nepali state. The preamble states that the constitution was issued as its formulator, the Constituent Assembly, was “committed to socialism”. Article 4(1) defines the State of Nepal as “an independent, indivisible, sovereign, secular, inclusive, democratic, socialism-oriented, federal democratic republican state”. Under the Directive Principles (Article 50, Clause 3), the objective of the State is “to develop a socialism-oriented independent and prosperous economy.” Tragically, the constitution has skipped the definition of the term “socialism”, making it a paradise for the interpretation of convenience.Political stunts often resurface to save socialism from falling from grace. When Pushpa Kamal Dahal, the chairman of the CPN (Maoist Centre), was prime minister, he formed a socialist front last January, including three other left parties—Janata Samajbadi Party, CPN (Unified Socialist) and CPN (Biplov). Now out of power, Dahal is trying to bring other fringe parties into the fold for a more organised opposition to the current government. There have been several efforts in history to unite the so-called socialists. But in practice, opportunism has homogenised Nepal’s every political outfit into a power-hungry brute force without principle, let alone ideology. The travesty, however, is that the fundamental allegation to demean one party by the other, mainly among the communist parties, is “the blatant abandonment of the principles of socialism.”Outdated narrativesSocialism takes refuge in utterly outdated socioeconomics and ecopolitical narratives for its survival. The overarching prescription is that the state must not only provide free health and education but also reduce the private sector’s role in the economy. The constitution includes free education up to the secondary level, free basic health care and gainful employment as fundamental rights. The socialists see all economic and political ills as the outcome of engulfing trends of liberalisation and globalisation. They still advocate for land reform that ensures entitlement of the “land to the tiller”. However, in reality, the younger generation is unwilling to own farms as they are moving away from agriculture to modern sectors of employment and entrepreneurship. Huge amounts of fertile land are increasingly being left uncultivated for want of people opting for farming. Besides, the unplanned drive of land fragmentation has converted entire farmlands into unfeasible patches for commercial-scale production of agricultural products. Failed land use planning and haphazard urbanisation have further eroded the prospects of the land used for agriculture.The pro-socialist crusade may not have appeared vocal to stop the privatisation of highly loss-making state-owned enterprises, stall private sector economic reforms and discontinue the centralised planning process, but they have crept into every aspect of economic policy-making. As a result, the economy is persistently left without a development model, and growth has stagnated beyond endurance. Nepal’s market integration with even the regional market is very limited, and the economy, seemingly irreversibly, becomes import-dependent, draining out capital and young brains.RamificationsThe discourse itself is anachronistic. The political parties are not competing to be forward-looking and pro-reform but to prove themselves purer socialists than others. This is rapidly disconnecting the political parties from the political system the country has adopted at a great opportunity cost and from the economic system that must generate output to increase public well-being.Philosophically, socialism with intended control of the state is the opposite pole to federalism, which seeks to devolve political and economic power closer to the masses. But most of Nepal’s political parties are playing devout socialists and ardent federalists. So, it is no surprise that federalism has been able to produce only suboptimal results during the last seven years of its implementation. The subnational political and administrative units created akin to the federal setup for all practical purposes remain subservient to the power concentrated at the centre. The concept of the controlling “central” government is finding it hard to convert into a coordinating “federal” government.The socialist idea of every facility being financed by the state certainly looks benign on the surface. This simply means the state treasury has to be adequately filled and continuously replenished to fulfil all existing public demands for services and facilities and be enough to meet future aspirations for improved quality of life. Without a reliable revenue source, the state can neither finance better public delivery nor develop infrastructure for the future. Nepal is now exactly in this trap.The real paradox of the socialist model of state-managed economy lies exactly here. Revenue on a convincing scale can only be generated if private sector investment substantially increases productivity, profit, employment and personal income. The state financing everything, even if it becomes a basic right included in the constitution, is impossible without making the market economy sizable, vibrant and capable of paying taxes. Such a market is impossible to imagine without unhindered private sector investment. Foreign investment is the new paradigm in the economies with comparative advantage. However, the very idea of a state-controlled socialist economy is perhaps enough to turn the heads of foreign investors away from the economy in question.Even Karl Marx’s Das Kapital advocated for the highest level of capital growth for extreme exploitation to explode into revolution. However, Nepali socialists didn't even recognise the importance of the inevitable expansion of capital for a state. The state apparatus has evolved since Marx to prevent extreme exploitation. Also, capitalists need not be exterminated by violence but can be constructively made liable to duly paying tax to the state.   \nMaya, a 36-year-old single mother from Babarmahal, Kathmandu never imagined that a polite rejection on Facebook two months ago would spiral into a living nightmare.Maya (her real name has been changed to protect her identity) became the target of an online stalker after she rejected a man’s advances. What started as a few friendly messages on social media quickly took a dark turn when the man demanded nude photos of her, which she refused to send.Unfazed, he started sending her unsolicited explicit images of himself. He then began tracking her online activity, leaving threatening messages, and eventually, he found her home address. “I would receive messages saying he was watching me, that he knew where my son went to school,” Maya told the Post. Despite blocking him multiple times, the stalker always found a way to reappear, using different accounts to harass her. Fearing for her nine-year-old son’s safety, she finally mustered the courage to file a complaint with the Cyber Bureau of Nepal Police 15 days ago.Since informing the stalker that she had taken legal action, he has not contacted her again, but the experience has left her feeling paranoid and anxious. She now fears leaving her home and hesitates to go online. “I just want to feel safe again, but I’m not sure if that’s possible anymore,” Maya says.Maya’s ordeal speaks volumes about how violence against women is no longer confined to physical spaces but has increasingly infiltrated the digital world in the form of online abuse, from revenge porn and bullying to sexual harassment, trolling, fraud, and blackmail.The severity of this issue becomes even clearer with data from the Cyber Bureau. In just under two months of the fiscal year 2024-25, the bureau has already recorded 882 cases of cybercrimes involving women. Looking back at previous years, the figures paint a troubling picture. In the fiscal year 2022-23, there were 9,013 reported cybercrime cases, with 4,590 filed by women. The period also saw 130 cases involving minor girls. The following year, 2023-24, witnessed a dramatic rise in the number of cases involving women to 8,745 and those involving minors to 382. This represents an increase of approximately 90.52 percent in cyber violence cases reported by women from 2022-23 to 2023-24.As the country entered a new fiscal year, the trend of online violence continues, with the bureau already reporting 35 cases involving minor girls and 882 cases involving adult women. However, these numbers alone do not capture the full extent of women’s and girls’ vulnerability in the digital space. Traditional beliefs, discrimination, and the normalisation of such behaviour, along with the fear that exposing abuse will shame them and their families, often lead to many cases going unreported.Rita, a 27-year-old woman, from Sunsari whom the Post is identifying with a pseudonym, is one such victim. She never imagined that a relationship she once cherished would end up destroying her life. After a difficult breakup, her ex-partner with whom she had a live-in relationship, sought revenge by sharing intimate videos and photos of her online with her family, friends, and relatives in 2022.For the next six months, her ex continued to sexually harass her through social media. The abuse only ceased after she attempted suicide, which resulted in a three-week hospitalisation.“Even after all this happened, my family refused to help me file a complaint. My relatives even mocked me, saying that I had already done intimate things during the live-in relationship. They said he wasn’t physically hurting or abusing me, so I should just get over it”, says Rita.According to a UN report based on studies in 10 countries, an estimated 95 percent of aggressive behaviour, harassment, abusive language, and degrading images online are directed at women, and they often come from partners or ex-partners.A year has passed for Rita, but the emotional scars remain, and she continues to struggle with depression.Many in Nepal, like Rita’s relatives, downplay the impact of online harassment, dismissing it as “just virtual, not physical.” However, a UN report titled ‘Combating Online Violence Against Women & Girls: A Worldwide Wake-Up Call,’ published by the UN Broadband Commission in 2015, tells a different story. It argues that ‘cyber touch’ can be as damaging as physical touch, suggesting that online abuse can be as bad as domestic violence or sexual assault.Now, as women across Nepal are celebrating Teej, many find themselves facing online violence. They are subjected to a barrage of hate speech simply for enjoying themselves.In recent years, the sight of women dancing, singing, drinking, and celebrating during Teej has sparked outrage among certain segments of society, particularly men who see these activities as a challenge to traditional gender roles. Social media trolls have seized on the opportunity to attack and criticise what they consider ‘inappropriate behaviour, clothing, and dance.’“Every year, it’s the same story,” says Ankita Chapagain, a 40-year-old from Kathmandu. “As soon as videos of women enjoying Teej and dancing go online, the hate comments start pouring in. We’re called names, our morals are questioned, and we’re blamed for the supposed degradation of society.”This animosity extends beyond anonymous trolls; it mirrors a deeper social unease with women’s independence and the pervasive misogyny and patriarchy in our culture. “It’s as if they can’t stand to see women happy and celebrating on their own terms,” Chapagain adds.The problem intensifies during elections, with female politicians facing significant online abuse. An analysis conducted by Panos South Asia reveals that insults and hate speech are the most common attacks on female politicians.A joint statement by the United Nations Special Rapporteurs on Violence against Women and Freedom of Expression says online violence against women can “chill and disrupt the online participation of women journalists, activists, human rights defenders, artists, and other public figures and private individuals” —which underscores the severe impact of growing cyber violence.So, how well-prepared are the institutions responsible for addressing this issue, like the Cyber Bureau? The answer seems to be, not very well.Superintendent of Police Deepak Raj Awasthi, spokesperson, and information officer of the Cyber Bureau, told the Post last month that the bureau is struggling with both understaffing and underfunding.The gap between the rise in cybercrimes and the lack of resources leaves the virtual realm a dangerous space, especially for girls and women who are already vulnerable due to unsafe physical environments, pervasive misogyny, and systemic discrimination. \nRae was the envoy to Kathmandu during the promulgation of the 2015 constitution and the subsequent blockade. In this conversation, Rae talks about the evolution of Nepal-India ties since the blockade, regional geopolitics, what the two countries get wrong about each other, how New Delhi views Nepali communist parties and the governments they lead, and the change (if any) in India’s neighbourhood policy since the start of Narendra Modi’s third term in office. \nKunwar has been the MD for just under three years. Before coming back to her homeland to join Daraz Nepal, she worked at different American companies, including Amazon, the world’s biggest e-commerce platform.

He has directed various plays, such as ‘Romeo and Juliet’, ‘Charlie and the Chocolate Factory’, and ‘Matilda’. Chaulagain is also the founder of ‘Lalabala’, an acting platform for children. He has also authored several books, such as ‘Kathmandu Geet’, ‘Taalatuli’, and ‘Ubadkhaabad’.In this conversation with the Post’s Rishika Dhakal, Chaulagain discusses his newly published book ‘Rudane’. What is your recent book about?My latest book is based on the life of Rup Chandra Bista, a well-known political figure. It's a mix of biography and fiction. Since the book is autobiographical fiction, some readers have asked why I chose to fictionalise Bista’s life instead of writing a straightforward biography. As someone with a background in theatre and drama, I was drawn to the dramatic elements of his journey. While biography is bound by facts, which anyone can research and present, fiction allows me to explore, be creative, and let my imagination shape the narrative. This approach makes the story more engaging, so I opted for a fictionalised account of Rup Chandra Bista’s life.While writing fiction, there’s a concern that the emotional elements might overshadow the historical facts, potentially erasing them. So, how have you balanced these aspects to avoid distorting history?I was aware of the challenge this posed as a writer. I never met Rup Chandra Bista, so I can’t write about him from a personal perspective. Sometimes, it’s easy to exaggerate a person's character when trying to make the narrative more dramatic, making them seem different from who they truly were. To ensure I was fair in my portrayal, after finishing the draft, I gave it to Rup Chandra Bista’s nephew, Bhuwan Prakash Bista, for his review. He raised similar questions and suggested a few corrections.Taking his feedback seriously, I revised the manuscript several times, carefully considering what he was trying to convey. After four or five rounds of edits, I feel I was able to present a more accurate balance of Bista's personality.However, my portrayal is still based on my understanding of him as a charismatic leader. I gathered information by listening to people who knew him and reading articles about his life, but my depiction may not fully capture his philosophy. That’s why I called it fiction.Why did you write about Rup Chandra Bista?In 2020, I did a play about Yogmaya, which was well-received. Yogmaya advocated a ‘dharma rajya’—a just and righteous society. While searching for another figure with a similar revolutionary spirit, I came across Rup Chandra Bista, whose story captivated me. A film about Bista was planned then, but the project was halted for 3-4 years and eventually cancelled. One of my brothers suggested turning the story into a drama. However, I was more fascinated with the narrative itself, and instead of writing it for the stage, I chose to turn it into fiction. That’s how the idea for the book emerged.Another reason I decided to write about Bista is that, in today’s political landscape, I don't see any leader with a philosophy like his. Bista was a leader who connected with people from all social classes. He had a separate group for children, encouraging them to “Know”—his guiding motto. He believed that awareness was key to individual and societal change. He also formed a group for women and supported their causes.Although Bista came from a wealthy family, he chose to live among the poor. He worked alongside them, striving to enlighten and uplift the marginalised.Bista’s deep connection with people and unique vision drew me to his story, leading me to base my book on his life.How important is your new book in today’s political and social climate? Looking back at history, Rup Chandra Bista was a political figure who thrived within the system of his time, winning elections multiple times during the Panchayat era. Yet, he wasn't afraid to openly criticise the Panchayat governments for their wrongdoings. Despite his privileged background, Bista lived a simple life. He strongly believed in reusing things and always wore second-hand clothes. In today’s world, with issues like climate change and overuse of resources, Bista’s lifestyle should resonate with our society. Inspired by him, I’ve started sleeping on the floor to feel more connected to the Earth.Bista also spent two decades living with farmers in Sim Bhanjyang, where he grazed goats and cultivated potatoes and cauliflower to improve their livelihoods. His focus on uplifting the underprivileged reflected his belief that society can only progress when the most disadvantaged rise.Looking at Nepal’s current political situation—where there is no consensus among parties and governance feels disorganised—alongside society’s increasingly materialistic values, I believe this book is more relevant than ever.How has your background in drama influenced your approach to writing fiction?As a drama student, I naturally include a lot of dialogue in my fiction writing. Writers like Buddhisagar and Subin Bhattarai often focus on playing with words and descriptions, but in my process, I focus on creating scenes, establishing characters, and weaving in dialogues. For instance, my book ‘Rudane’ has plenty of dramatic dialogue. Without them, the book could have risked becoming a straightforward biography. However, the dialogue helped breathe life into the characters. Writing them and building scenes allowed me to bring the story to life.Writing drama in Nepal is particularly challenging. The play's audience is small, and there is no guarantee that it will reach its intended audience or be published and read. That's one of the reasons I shifted toward fiction writing. However, I still translate plays I enjoy, which helps me balance my love for both forms. Even in my fiction, especially in the dialogues, the influence of drama is quite evident.While fiction usually requires fewer dialogues than drama, writing both involves building vivid scenes. For example, when writing a scene with four characters in a café, I instinctively imagine the entire setting, down to the smallest details. My background in drama has been invaluable in this regard, as it has helped me visualise scenes more easily and bring them to life in my fiction.What message do you want to convey to readers through your book? Rup Chandra Bista's life offers many valuable lessons. He believed in living a minimalist lifestyle and prioritised using Nepali products. Bista often wore clothes, bags, and other items made from burlap sacks. Despite being offered prestigious jobs, including one by Juddha Shumsher, he always put the well-being of others before his own.In contrast, today's generation often focuses more on personal gains than thinking of others. Through my book, I hope readers will learn from Bista’s selfless lifestyle and reflect on how they can also think about the needs of others. Bista was a man of strong principles and died on his terms. His statement, “Those I tried to awaken never did. Those who were awakened only ended up supporting the opposition,” reflects his deep frustration with the political system of his time.Beyond the political and social lessons, Bista's life, as shared through various articles and stories, offers timeless insights into leadership, selflessness, and the pursuit of justice for all.Tanka Chaulagain’s book recommendationsSotalaAuthor: Dor Bahadur BistaPublisher: Sajha PrakashanYear: 1976Bista's work captures a bygone era when many Nepalis journeyed to Tibet for the salt trade, offering readers a glimpse into Nepali society at that time.Lamppost Bata Khaseko JoonAuthor: Manu ManjilPublisher: FinePrintYear: 2011This poetry collection features forty-six free verse poems and the book is known for its portrayal of contemporary Nepali culture.Mantha Darayeko JugAuthor: Mohan Mainali Publisher: Heritage Publishers and DistributorYear: 2015This book chronicles the lives of those who were killed during the war, highlighting their valiant efforts to protect themselves and their families.YashodharaAuthor: Haribol KaflePublisher: Lipi BooksYear: 2023Told from Yashodhara's perspective, this novel provides a fresh view of Siddhartha's journey to becoming the Buddha.UlarAuthor: Nayanraj PandeyPublisher: Tanneri PrakashanYear: 1998This book is a window into the harsh reality of politics and people who have suffered from political instability. \nRepresentatives at the first national conference of the Rastriya Swatantra Party saw factionalism within the party.Some of the representatives who arrived in Kathmandu three days ago for the two-day gathering starting on Tuesday said that growing factionalism is not healthy for the new political outfit promising to challenge traditional forces like the Nepali Congress and the CPN-UML.“We were told that factionalism existed in our party in various forms, but we denied such claims. However, during our three days in Kathmandu, we witnessed it,” a group of party members told the Post. It seems that President Rabi Lamichhane and Vice-president Swarnim Wagle are not in the same boat on how the party should function, they added.RSP acting spokesperson Manish Jha explains that it is the lack of synchronisation—rather than differences—between the leaders. “People from various schools of thought came together to form the RSP. It is true that we lack synchronisation, but it would be wrong to portray it as differences.”Another leader of the party said on condition of anonymity that the party has two schools of thought—one based on democratic principles and the other opposed to it.RSP acting general secretary Kabindra Burlakoti claims that the party is united.In conversations with the Post, representatives from Kathmandu Valley, Pokhara and Chitwan sounded more optimistic with the central leadership while those from remote areas were confused over their take on the party’s central leadership.The representatives from Madhesh were mild in their opinion about the leadership.Moreover, representatives were also not very positive about the way the central leadership is investing their energy to claim that Lamichhane had got a clean chit from the parliamentary special committee formed to investigate crisis-ridden cooperatives.The probe panel, which submitted its report to the House of Representatives, has recommended the government prosecute Lamichhane, along with his former business partner GB (Gitendra Babu) Rai, board member of the media Kumar Ramtel and initial founder Chhabi Lal Joshi as per the prevailing laws. The inquiry committee, however, has said it couldn’t establish Lamichhane’s role in rerouting the cooperatives fund to Gorkha Media Network.“It would have been better had the central leadership waited to see how the government would take action,” the group of representatives from western Nepal told the Post. “In case Lamichhane is booked under the law, it could be counterproductive for the party in the long run.”The political campaign started by the RSP won’t get stalled even without Lamichhane, the representatives said, expressing their confidence in the party’s longevity.Lamichhane also presented a political report incorporating proposed statutory changes, the party’s commitments to voters, policy agenda presented by Swarnim Wagle at the Jaleshwar meeting and the conclusion drawn from the closed session of the national conference.Lamichhane’s report states that the policy paper presented in Jaleshwar defined ‘constitutional socialism’ as the party’s political ideology. Lamichhane also accuses the ruling Nepali Congress and CPN-UML of trying to lead the country to a two-party system by polarising smaller parties. “On the pretext of administrative reform, they are planning to wipe out the existence of small parties,” the report reads. “Potentially, this step can bring together new parties that want to be an alternative political force sooner or later.”Asked about RSP’s possible alliance with other parties, Burlakoti said though they are not in talks with the main opposition CPN (Maoist Centre), they are in regular contact with several independent candidates of last election.Asked if they are in discussion with Kathmandu Metropolitan City Mayor Balendra Shah, who won the 2022 local election independently, Burlakoti said: “Strategic moves are not to be disclosed.”However, when the national conference concluded after Lamichhane presented his report, representatives arriving from around the country were displeased.“This is not the way a party functions,” a representative told the Post, asking not to be named for fears of reprisal.When leaders put themselves at the centre and cadres in the periphery, the party’s downfall begins, another representative said. Acting General Secretary Burlakoti, however, defended the party leadership. “Our national conference was designed this way,” Burlakoti said. The report presented by the chair will be discussed in the party’s Mahakali-Mechi campaign that will start soon, he added.“At the national conference, we gave 5 percent of the total representatives (1500) time to speak, but those who spoke exceeded that number,” Burlakoti said.The conference, however, passed Lamichhane’s report. On Wednesday, Lamichhane announced the date of the party’s first general convention. It will be held on May 8-10 at a yet-undecided venue.“I would like to inform you that the Central Committee has become the general convention organising committee,” Burlakoti said. Lamichhane also announced the ‘Mahakali-Mechi Campaign’ to interact with the general public.In his report, Lamichhane has proposed a person not affiliated to any party to be elected the country’s president, directly elected executive head, or the prime minister. He also proposes giving the nation’s vice president the responsibility to chair the National Assembly.While the paper bats for a fully proportional electoral system, it says provincial assemblies cannot be accepted in the current shape.However, this does not mean the RSP is against the federal structure gained through the sacrifice of thousands of people, another representative said. “Our party has no strength to amend the constitution and scrap the federal structure. Therefore, for the time being, voices are growing among the party members about accepting the present political structure,” Khemraj Koirala, a conference representative from Kailali told the Post.Party members also suggested downsizing the number of ministers to make the provincial system functional, Koirala said.The report also stands for reducing the number of municipalities to less than 500, from the current 753. \nRastriya Swatantra Party chair Rabi Lamichhane, addressing a two-day national conference of the party's central council that started on Tuesday, said that the emergence of the RSP has been a headache for Nepal’s traditional political parties.“Until we win a majority in the next election, their headache will continue,” Lamichhane said. “Some people think that if Rabi Lamichhane is defeated, then the role of RSP in national politics will shrink. However, with or without Rabi, RSP now will move ahead as a campaign.”At the national conference of central council members, all seven provincial committees presented their reports. In the process, some committees briefed the RSP on the financial difficulties they are facing to run their day-to-day activities, whereas others hinted at the challenges they are facing building the party organisation.Party’s Koshi provincial president Rajesh Timilsina said there are 25,000 RSP cadres in the province. Due to irregular levy payments from cadres, it had been difficult to run the party.“We now face the challenge in expanding the party’s membership base,” a party leader quoted Timilsina as saying. There were more people frustrated with the party’s activities than those attracted to it.Timilsina also called for a regular financial source to carry out party activities, the leader said.RSP provincial president for Madhesh Tapeshwar Yadav presented a report depicting the party in good light in the province. “If general elections were to be held now, our party would either lead the province or take the main opposition position,” a party insider told the Post, quoting Yadav.Achyut Lamichhane, the provincial chief of Bagmati, claimed that the leadership had expanded the membership in Chitwan and Kathmandu by 7,000 and 5,000, respectively.Party’s Lumbini committee chief Devraj Pathak, presenting the provincial report, said that a funds crunch had hampered the committee’s activities. In Karnali, the RSP is tackling geographical difficulties in welcoming more members to the party. Sudurpaschim party chief also briefed the leadership on the difficulties the provincial committee is facing in expanding the membership, the party leaders said.The financial report presented by RSP treasurer Lima Adhikari suggests that the party’s income totalled Rs34 million in the fiscal year 2023-2024. The amount includes membership fee, donations, sale of publicity materials, and interest on deposits, among other sources. According to RSP leaders, at least 50 representatives expressed their opinions in the ‘open session’ on Tuesday. They suggested that the leadership should be protected from external attacks, and the party chair should be allowed to form a team so as to ease the party’s operation.Vice-chair Swarnim Wagle presented a brief explanation on the ‘policy paper’ endorsed by the party’s Jaleshwar meeting last year.Acting General Secretary Kabindra Burlakoti presented a proposal for amending the party statute. Burlakoti proposes three vice-presidents and joint general secretaries, including a woman in each position.Apart from the treasurer and spokesperson, all the office bearers are also proposed to be directly elected.Though the party called its first national conference to discuss a wide array of issues, the report submitted by the parliamentary special probe committee on Monday dominated the discourse.The report on crisis-ridden cooperatives, submitted to the government via the Speaker of the House of Representatives, also concerns the fate of RSP President Rabi Lamichhane. Though the report does not directly implicate Lamichhane in the cooperatives fraud, it links him to the spending of the money illegally sourced from multiple cooperatives. The report also recommended prosecuting four individuals: Lamichhane, then-managing director of Gorkha Media Network; chairman Gitendra Babu (GB) Rai; board member Kumar Ramtel; and initial founder Chhabi Lal Joshi.Lamichhane was accused of diverting funds from multiple cooperatives to run the media company that operated the Galaxy 4K Television channel, which ceased operations last year. Rai and Lamichhane co-founded and jointly ran the media company before Lamichhane joined politics in June 2022.Lamichhane also claims to have held 15 percent of sweat shares in the company, which he sold after completing the legal procedure as he quit the television. However, the committee’s investigation found those claims to be false. Denying his involvement in the cooperatives scam, Lamichhane and other RSP lawmakers attacked the Nepali Congress for its repeated stance that led to the parliamentary committee’s formation.RSP leaders at the meeting tried to establish that Lamichhane had got a clean chit from the probe.Before concluding the conference on Wednesday, Lamichhane will present his political report. This conference is also expected to schedule the party’s first general convention for May next year. \nThe parliamentary special probe committee formed to investigate crisis-ridden cooperatives has concluded that Rabi Lamichhane, the chairman of the Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP), was involved in misusing millions of rupees received from cooperatives when he was the managing director of the now defunct Gorkha Media Network.The committee’s report recommends that the government take action against former deputy prime minister and home minister Lamichhane for the act.Lamichhane was accused of diverting funds from multiple cooperatives to run the media company that operated the Galaxy 4K Television channel, which ceased operations last year. Chairman GB (Gitendra Babu) Rai and managing director Lamichhane co-founded and jointly ran the media company before Lamichhane joined politics in June 2022.“During our investigation, we found that the investment in the Gorkha Media Network had been made with the money diverted from various cooperatives,” Ishwari Devi Neupane, a Nepali Congress member of the probe committee, told the Post. “Although Lamichhane has been found guilty of using funds from cooperatives for Gorkha Media Network, it could not directly link him to the rerouting of cooperative funds.”Lamichhane has consistently denied any involvement in the misappropriation of cooperative funds. However, the report of the parliamentary special committee formed to investigate crisis-ridden cooperatives has concluded that Rs650 million from five credit cooperatives, including the Pokhara-based Surya Darshan Cooperative, Butwal-based Supreme Cooperatives, Chitwan-based Sahara Cooperatives, Birgunj-based Sano Paila Cooperatives, and Kathmandu-based Swarnalaxmi Cooperatives, were diverted to the Gorkha Media Network.The committee’s report, which was submitted to Speaker Devraj Ghimire at a meeting of the House of Representatives on Monday, recommends prosecuting four individuals, including Lamichhane, the then managing director of Gorkha Media Network; chairman Gitendra Babu (GB) Rai; a board member Kumar Ramtel; and initial founder Chhabi Lal Joshi.“Those in the roles of shareholders, board members and managing director can’t evade accountability and liability for the money that comes into the company,” reads the report submitted by the chair of the probe panel, CPN-UML lawmaker Surya Thapa. It states that the bank account holders who operate the account should be responsible for how the money in that account is used. “Since Rai, Ramtel, Lamichhane and Joshi are seen to be using the money that came into the company from various cooperatives, we recommend that the Nepal government prosecute them in accordance with the prevailing laws,” the report further says. An Interpol diffusion notice has been issued against Rai, who has been on the run and is believed to be abroad. Ramtel is in judicial custody.The probe panel has also recommended that the government make binding legal arrangements for the payment for share purchases and sales. The report also suggests that the government make proper legal arrangements concerning sweat shares and prompt relevant agencies to address the matter. Lamichhane claimed to have held 15 percent of sweat shares in the company, which he said he sold after completing all legal procedures. However, the committee’s investigation found those claims to be false. “Forgery was involved in the purchase and sale of sweat shares,” Lekhnath Dahal, the CPN (Maoist Centre) lawmaker and committee member, told the Post. The report states that the office bearers of the media company had used forged documents while transferring the company’s shares, and recommends that the government carry out further investigation of the matter and take necessary actions.However, RSP leaders had their own interpretation of the probe committee’s report.RSP chair Lamichhane and Vice-chair Swarnim Wagle, while leaving the House meeting, claimed that the committee had acquitted Lamichhane of the allegations that he was involved in embezzlement of cooperative funds. They said they welcome the committee’s report, and noted that Shishir Khanal, the RSP member in the committee, did not even write a note of dissent “as the report had exonerated the party chair”.RSP leaders also claimed that the accusations from other parties had been proved false.Manish Jha, acting spokesperson of the RSP, said that even Congress General Secretary Gagan Thapa had claimed that Lamichhane was directly involved in diverting cooperative funds to the media company using his own signature. Jha claimed that the report disproves this accusation. “We had acknowledged that Gorkha Media Network had diverted the cooperative funds for its operation, which the report confirms,” he added.“We had assumed the report might do great damage to our party, but we are pleased how it has been presented,” Jha told the Post. “Things will become clearer after the full report is made public.”But committee members don’t agree with the RSP leaders’ interpretation. “They may have assumed that their party chair would be directly implicated, but that did not happen,” said Dhruba Bahadur Pradhan, a Rastriya Prajantra Party (RPP) lawmaker and committee member. He said that not being directly implicated does not mean that he was not involved in the scam. “Our law does not permit the rerouting of the cooperative funds to a private company, yet Lamichhane and the company did exactly that. He can be prosecuted for this,” Pradhan, who is also a former chief of Nepal Police, told the Post.Legal experts say that Lamichhane could face prosecution under four different laws based on the findings of the parliamentary special inquiry committee’s report. “Lamichhane could be charged the cooperative fraud case under the Cooperative Act, fraud and duping under the National Penal Code, organised crime cases under the Organised Crime Prevention Act and money laundering case under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act,” advocate Om Parkash Aryal told the Post.The committee was formed on May 28 and had four-point terms of reference to investigate cooperative funds embezzlement. Among the four-point ToR, the cooperatives linked with the funding of the now-defunct Gorkha Media Network will also be probed.The probe panel had three months to complete its work from the first day of the committee meeting which was held a week later after the committee’s formation. When the committee could not complete its task in the given time, Parliament had extended the term by 15 days, to September 22. But the committee has submitted its report before the expiry of the extended time. Speaker Devraj Ghimire forwarded the report to the government for implementation after committee chair Thapa submitted it to the House of Representatives on Monday.The lower house formed the special inquiry committee after the erstwhile main opposition party Nepali Congress obstructed House meetings continuously for weeks demanding the formation of such a panel.The Congress, along with the RPP, demanded a parliamentary special probe committee to investigate the cooperative embezzlement, claiming involvement of the then deputy prime minister and home minister Lamichhane. The then ruling parties the CPN (Maoist Centre), the major coalition partners UML and Lamichhne’s RSP were against the demand.Lamichhane, host of a popular television show, founded the RSP in June 2022. RSP is the fourth largest party in Parliament with 21 lawmakers (including deputy speaker).He is linked with multiple controversies. His case regarding the use of dual passports is sub judice. He was also stripped of his position as a lawmaker and minister for home affairs in early 2023 after he was found guilty of contesting the 2022 election without proper Nepali citizenship. Lamichhane had obtained an American green card, but contested the election in Chitwan-2 without first re-acquiring Nepali citizenship. He won by a huge margin. Lamichhane, who had been stripped of the lawmaker position on charges of using dual citizenship, got reelected as the lawmaker from the same constituency in a by-election held in 2023. Similarly, the parliamentary special probe committee has recommended that the government investigate Jyoti Gurung, former wife of Nepali Congress Vice President and lawmaker Dhan Raj Gurung. Jyoti Gurung, who was a board member of Miteri Cooperative, is accused of mishandling more than Rs120 million of the cooperative’s funds. “The Miteri cooperative chairman, Khumbharaj Gurung, had complained to the committee about Dhan Raj Gurung and his wife over their mishandling of the cooperative's money,” Pradhan said. “So the committee report has recommended further investigation into the Gurungs.” On Friday, the special committee members visited the Miteri Cooperatives office at Mahalaxmisthan in Lalitpur, to discuss the matter with its chairman.After being charged with embezzling the cooperative’s funds, Congress Vice President Gurung, speaking in Parliament on September 10, called for a thorough probe to clear his name. Pradhan said the committee found no evidence implicating lawmaker Gurung in the misappropriation. Cooperatives are considered to be self-regulatory bodies, but in Nepal a large number of cooperatives are being operated arbitrarily by a handful of operators. The committee report also suggests that the government should establish a strong regulatory body to look after the financial aspect of cooperatives.Apart from chair Thapa the committee had six other members. Sarita Bhusal from the UML; Dilendra Prasad Badu and Ishwari Devi Neupane from the Congress; Lekhnath Dahal from Maoist Centre; Sishir Khanal from RSP and Dhruba Bahadur Pradhan from RPP. \nPanic gripped locals in ward 12 of Chandragiri Municipality, Kathmandu, on Thursday morning after a suspicious object was found in the locality.The suspicious object was spotted in front of Balambu Secondary School, sparking fears of a bomb threat.Locals informed the police, and a bomb disposal team from the Nepal Army arrived at the scene. According to the NA Directorate of Public Relations and Information, the team disposed of the suspicious object, which turned out to be a pressure cooker.   \nKathmandu Metropolitan City has extended the area to prohibit building any structure on either side of the rivers in its territory.In a notice on Wednesday, the city office stated that construction of any structure has been barred on the additional 20 meters from the existing prohibited area.According to the metropolis notice, if the city has, under the existing rule, prohibited any construction on 20 meters from the area marked as river, the prohibited area will now be altogether 40 meters on either side of the waterway.The metropolis said the decision was taken based on a recent Supreme Court verdict that directed the authorities concerned to prohibit construction within an additional 20 metres from riverbanks in the Kathmandu Valley.Currently, construction is permitted only 20 metres beyond major riverbanks in the Kathmandu metropolis.The notice issued by the metropolis states, “No construction will be permitted on an additional 20 metres of land on either side of the river, and ongoing construction will be halted.”It has also asked one and all not to release contaminated water, including sewage, into Bagmati River and its tributaries. “Private and government buildings, as well as commercial properties, must install soak pits for groundwater recharge,” it said. “Waste must not be disposed of in the rivers. Non-compliance will lead to legal action under existing laws.” \nThe rhythmic beat of the Dha echoes through a Bhaktapur alley, blending with the energetic footsteps of dancers. Bhaktapur, which sees jatras and festivals round the year, is no stranger to music, dance and celebrations. But this is not an ordinary occasion. The performers in question are Lakhe dancers who are reviving the Ranjitkar Lakhe dance after a century.The young dancers are preparing for Indra Jatra this year, where mask-clad Lakhe dancers roam the streets to rid the community of hardships and suffering. Lakhe, demon deities revered as protectors of people and crops, are thought to reside in the demonic mask. As the dancer dons the mask, the spirit is said to take over.Bhaktapur was once a key site for the Ranjitkar Lakhe performances, but the art form vanished from the city after the 1934 earthquake.“Bhaktapur suffered the most damage during the 1934 earthquake,\" says Ganesh Ram Ranjit, treasurer of the Ranjitkar Group’s Bhaktapur branch. “The destruction left residents struggling to recover for a decade, making it nearly impossible to perform the costly Lakhe dance.”The Ranjitkar Group discovered the extinct dance in the year the group was established. They located a Lakhe temple in Bhaktapur that had closed after the earthquake. After two years of research, they learned that performing the Lakhe dance was seen as a good omen in Bhaktapur and involved hosting community feasts. However, the high cost of this tradition forced many to sell their properties, rendering it unfeasible in the city’s post-earthquake conditions. Over time, the dance was abandoned as more lands supporting these cultural events were lost during rapid urbanisation.“There was a significant decline in our engagement with our cultural heritage,” says Rabi Shakya, a sculptor and Lakhe dance teacher training the new dancers. “The encouraging change now is the strong interest from the new generation, which is making it possible to revive intangible heritage like this dance.”After 100 years, the Ranjitkar Lakhe Dance is making a return to Bhaktapur at this year’s Indra Jatra.“It’s challenging to accurately re-enact the dance since it hasn’t been seen in a century,” Shakya notes. “As a sculptor, I drew inspiration from Bhaktapur’s revered Shree Navadurga Bhawani to create the Lakhe’s mask.” Similarly, the dance was choreographed by studying Lakhe dances from Kathmandu, Patan, and Banepa within the Ranjitkar community, and combining them with traditional steps from Bhaktapur Lakhe dances.“As for the musical instruments, we are using traditional instruments like Dha, Dhime, and Ponga, which are said to excite the Lakhe,” says Rajendra Maharjan, Lakhe dance teacher and musician.Maharjan is one of the experienced Newari arts teachers working to revive the lost Lakhe dance. He is involved in training young students in cultural arts and is now dedicated to the Ranjitkar dance training, with the students practising together nearly every day.“Becoming a Lakhe performer involves more than just wearing the costume and mask,” said Sudin Ranjit, a Lakhe dance student. “We must train extensively with our teachers, and it demands a lot of hard work.”To Ranjit, a resident of Bhaktapur, the training is more than learning a new craft; it is a matter of protecting culture. Growing up only interested in instruments, he slowly understood how important continuing cultural practices like Lakhe dances is for their community.“The dance will not only bolster Bhaktapur’s cultural pride but also boost tourism and create jobs,” says Dr Purushottam Lochan Shrestha, a professor and researcher specialising in Bhaktapur and Newari culture.Shrestha notes that reviving the dance would offer employment to everyone involved, from the dancers and the sculptor making the masks to those participating in the rituals. “Economic centres throughout the city, from small businesses to large industries, will benefit from the influx of tourists attracted by the Lakhe dance,” Shrestha adds, commending the Ranjitkar group's initiative.Once the Ranjitkar community revitalises the Lakhe dance, the Ranjitkar group plans to set up a new Guthi house with a fresh community fund and organise annual events for the dance.“The Lakhe dance won’t let them separate,” Shakya remarks.In today’s globalised world, where identity often merges into a homogenised blend, shared cultural practices provide a sense of connection and belonging. This new Lakhe dance embodies that spirit of togetherness for the community involved.“Reviving the dance after 100 years,” Shakya says, “is about preserving our culture for the next 300 years.” \nThe Lions Club of Kathmandu Corporate, Nepal MD325-D has felicitated various personalities as part of its endeavour to recognise the contribution of the individuals and business entities for the society.As part of its campaign, the Lions Club of Kathmandu honoured Prateek Pradhan with Social Journalism Award, Sylapa T Rimponche with Social Spiritual Award, Erika Gurung with Social Player Award, Ramesh Corporation with Social Corporate House Award, Rajendra Malla with Social Corporate Leader Award and Rajesh Hamal with Social Celebrity Award.Likewise, Chandra Ghimire is honoured with Social Bureaucratic Award, Binod Das with Sports Management Award, Anil Kedia with Social Academic Award, Mohan Ojha with Social Management Award and Surya Nepal with Corporate Social Responsibility Award.The Lionism embarked in Nepal in 1971 as the Lions Club of Biratnagar under the stewardship of former Prime Minister Matrika Prasad Koirala.The Lions Clubs International says it has over 2,000 clubs operating across the nation. \nThe government has declared a public holiday in the Kathmandu Valley on Sunday to celebrate the Bhoto Jatra.On the occasion of the festival, a public holiday has been declared in the three districts of Kathmandu Valley [Kathmandu, Lalitpur, and Bhaktapur], according to a statement by Narayan Prasad Bhattarai, spokesperson for the Ministry of Home Affairs, on Friday.The government announces a public holiday each year on this occasion.The month-long chariot-pulling festival of Rato Machhindranath concludes with the displaying of a bhoto (a jewel-studded vest) at Jawalakhel, Lalitpur. It is an annual cultural and religious ritual of displaying the black jewel-studded vest believed to be of then Nagraj, the serpent King.Machhindranath is revered as the God of rain, good harvest and prosperity. Paying homage to Lord Machhindranath is believed to bring good luck and fulfil one’s wishes. \n\nThe Nepal-India Chamber of Commerce & Industry (NICCI) participated in the Bodhgaya-Nalanda Conference—BIMSTEC Plus, which was organised by the Synergia Foundation in collaboration with Nalanda University in Bihar, India, on September 12.Sunil KC, vice-president of NICCI, representing the Nepali delegation, attended the three-day event. KC emphasised the importance of cultural and economic integration among BIMSTEC nations while speaking at the event session entitled, ‘Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation (BIMSTEC) Plus: Shared Cultural Values and Futures’.He highlighted how the BIMSTEC bridges South and Southeast Asia, fostering a deep-rooted connection through shared historical values and economic ties.KC underscored the vital role of culture in regional development, noting that shared cultural heritage can drive economic collaboration, particularly in sectors like tourism, education, and creative industries. He called for greater cooperation to promote tourism, leveraging the region’s rich cultural diversity, and boosting local economies.The conference explored the vision of \"BIMSTEC Plus\" to extend partnerships beyond the region, creating wider economic corridors and addressing global challenges such as climate change, digital innovation, and economic resilience. \nSingapore Airlines said it would be operating two out of seven weekly flights between Singapore and Kathmandu with 787-10 Dreamliner during the festive season of Dashain and Tihar in October and November.

The 787-10 Dreamliner will be operated on Mondays and Thursdays. The aircraft is equipped with KrisWorld, in-flight Wi-Fi connectivity, fully flat beds and direct aisle access for all Business Class customers, and ergonomically-designed seats in Economy Class, offering all customers a more comfortable in-flight experience.Nepalis who are based overseas will be able to return home to spend Dashain and Tihar with their family and loved ones. The Boeing 787-10 Dreamliner is equipped with a total of 337 seats consisting of 36 Business Class seats and 301 Economy Class seats.  \nNcell, Nepal’s first private-sector GSM mobile service provider, celebrated nearly two decades of serving the country and its people with an important announcement: the launch of the Ncell Foundation to continue its Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) initiatives.“Over the past 19 years, Ncell has contributed over Rs2 billion to CSR activities in health, education, environment, and more, impacting over 13 million lives directly and indirectly. We now believe it is important to bring all of our good work under one umbrella, one purpose, and that is the Ncell Foundation,” said Jabbor Kayumov, chief executive officer and managing director of Ncell, during a special event organised to mark the 19th anniversary of the company.At the event, Ncell said the Foundation’s vision is to foster a more inclusive, connected and sustainable Nepal and contribute to the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) with 3 clear objectives: Supporting those who need it the most, bridging the digital divide and fostering a more healthy, sustainable and enriching Nepal.During the 2015 earthquake, Ncell contributed Rs100 million to the Prime Minister Disaster Relief Fund to support families affected by the devastating earthquake and another Rs1.6 billion worth of communication support was extended to help families stay connected.During the Covid-19 pandemic, Ncell contributed Rs100 million to support the government’s procurements of protective gear, PCR testing kits. And in Jajarkot after the earthquake last year, Ncell supported the Karnali provincial government with immediate support of Rs5 million for rescue, treatment, and relief of earthquake victims and also helped build classrooms in 10 government schools so children could go back to school. In 2014, Ncell contributed Rs200 million to the Prime Minister Disaster Relief Fund to help flood and landslide victims in different parts of the country.Ncell honoured Para-athlete Palesha Goverdhan, who recently made history at the Paris Paralympics 2024 by winning Nepal’s first-ever medal. A new initiative, ‘19 for 19,’ under the Ncell Foundation, was also announced. This project will provide financial support of Rs1 million each to 19 social projects across the country’s seven provinces.  \nThe licences of hundreds of health facilities of Bagmati Province have not been renewed for the past two years, as the provincial government has yet to enact its public health law.Health officials say even if the licences of most private health facilities have expired, those facilities are not illegal.They, however, concede that no agency in the country is monitoring activities of the private health facilities and their service quality due to the failure to renew the licences.“Other provinces across the country have already passed the provincial public health act to govern private hospitals up to 200-bed capacity and other health facilities,” said Dr Arjun Sapkota, chief of the Health Office, Kathmandu. “We hope that the Bagmati provincial government will introduce the provincial public health act soon, which will clear the way for licence renewal of the institutions fulfilling the due procedure.”There are over 1,000 private health facilities, including 52 private hospitals, in Kathmandu district alone. If all the health facilities in the province are counted, they will number in thousands, officials said.Operators of private health facilities, including the Association of Private Health Institutions of Nepal (APHIN), an umbrella organisation of private hospital operators, complained that they are deprived of banking services, importing health equipment and other facilities due to the apathy of the relevant agencies to renew the licences.“We recently held discussion with officials at the Health Office, Kathmandu and drew their attention to the non-renewal of licences,” said Dr Padam Bahadur Khadka, chairman of the Private Health institutions of Nepal. “Health facilites have been facing several problems including problems in importing equipment and banking facilities, among others.”Health officials say that monitoring of private health facilities operating in the districts of the Bagmati Province has been halted due to non-renewal of licences. They say that the condition of hospital equipment, manpower, hospital waste management, power back-up, operation theatres and emergency wards also need to be monitored but remain unattended for years.Studies show over 95 percent private hospitals have been operating out of rented residential buildings that have no proper patient safety measures. Nor are the facilities equipped to withstand disasters like earthquake and fire, and to handle patient flow caused by such disasters and disease outbreaks.Buildings that are currently being used by private hospitals were built many years ago and do not meet the basic criteria as they aren’t equipped with emergency entry and exit points, fire escapes, and waiting areas, among others. Majority of private hospitals also lack the required human resource and force staff to work overtime in the absence of enough personnel.Inspections carried out in the past show that most hospitals are also found to be lacking in hazardous waste management systems. The inspection team of the Ministry of Health and Population and local units found that most hospitals segregate hospital waste but the waste is then sent to private companies for management, where household waste is mixed up with the hospital waste. When hazardous waste produced from hospitals is left untreated, chances of infection spreading in communities are high.“Once the provincial government brings the provincial public health act, we will monitor the health facilities and renew licences,” Sapkota said. \nA 24-year-old student has died from the Nipah virus in the southern Indian state of Kerala, a local medical official said on Monday, and 151 people who came into contact with the victim are under observation to prevent the spread of the deadly virus.This is the second death caused by Nipah in Kerala since July. Nipah is classified as a priority pathogen by the World Health Organization (WHO) because of its potential to trigger an epidemic. There is no vaccine to prevent infection and no treatment to cure it.Parts of Kerala are among those most at risk globally for outbreaks of the virus, a Reuters investigation showed last year. Nipah, which comes from fruit bats and animals such as pigs, can cause a lethal, brain-swelling fever in humans.The student started showing fever symptoms on September 4 and died five days later, said R. Renuka, a district medical officer in the town of Malappuram, located in northern Kerala.The testing of a blood sample from the victim sent to the National Institute of Virology in Pune confirmed a Nipah infection on September 9, Renuka said.Five other people who have developed primary symptoms of a Nipah infection have had blood samples drawn and they were sent for tests, she said, without saying if they were primary contacts of the dead person.Nearly 151 people are being monitored for any symptoms after they were found to be on the primary contact list of the victim, who had come from Bengaluru, she said.This is the second death from a Nipah infection in Malappuram this year after a 14-year-old boy succumbed in July.Nipah has been linked to the deaths of dozens of people in Kerala since its first appearance in the state in 2018. \nLast week, a 24-year-old woman from Kathmandu was rushed to Tribhuvan University Teaching Hospital for treatment of a drug overdose. The woman had consumed multiple tablets with the intent to end her life, and it was her second attempt to kill herself.“We advised the right treatment to doctors attending the patient and also closely monitored her,” said Dr Apeksha Bista, a specialist in the Poison Information Center. “Along with treatment, several tests were carried out to assess the impact on her vital organs. The woman survived, and we referred her for psychiatric care.”This was among the 284 cases where the Poison Information Center either directly supervised or provided treatment advice in the last one year. The centre’s assistance has saved lives, not only in big city hospitals but also in far-flung health facilities across the country. However, the country’s only poison information centre, which started a year ago, is now on the verge of closure due to a shortage of funds. “This project, which was initiated with financial and technical support from Brown Emergency Medicine and logistic support from ASK Foundation, as a pilot initiative is nearing completion,” said Dr Dinesh Kafley, executive director at the Tribhuvan University Teaching Hospital. “ This is the only centre in the country that has been helping health workers in saving lives. Without resources, we are not in a position to continue the centre.”Studies show pesticide ingestion is the second major cause of suicide in Nepal, after hanging. Among those who consume pesticides, 95 percent ingest insecticides like aluminium phosphide, organophosphorus, and aluminium and zinc phosphide, among others. Despite the authorities banning dichlorvos and the removing the most toxic formulations of aluminium phosphide from sale years ago, suicide by pesticide ingestion has not declined.In the last fiscal year, 7,223 people in Nepal ended their lives, according to the Nepal Police data.“Just a few days ago, a doctor from Sankhusabha district sought help for the treatment of a 17-year-old girl who had ingested cypermethrin, an insecticide,” said Dr Rakesh Ghimire, coordinator of the Poison Information Centre. “We not only provided treatment guidance but followed up twice. The patient fully recovered and has been discharged from the hospital.”Experts say deaths due to pesticide poisoning can be reduced if poisoning cases are managed optimally. Health workers, including doctors, can call the Poison Information Centre hotline at 01 4502011 for treatment assistance.“Many healthworkers have already sought help,” said Ghimire. “Those who do not know or have not reached out could also call for expert advice. Doctors at the centre will provide the latest data and information on antidotes for treating poisoning.”  Doctors at the centre say besides intentional suicide attempts, cases of accidental drug overdose, ingestion of mosquito repellent, toilet cleaner, nutmeg (spice), toothpaste, and mushroom poisoning are frequently reported to them.According to doctors, most patients get cured if they are taken to the hospital on time, as physicians know the proper antidotes for poisons. They say that with detailed knowledge of toxicology, which overlaps biology, chemistry, pharmacology, and medicine, is not extensively taught in Nepal’s medical schools. Toxicology studies the adverse effects of chemicals on living organisms and their diagnosis and treatment.Experts also point out that seeking support helps patients’ relatives financially, as they do not have to rush mild cases to big hospitals and hire an ambulance.Dr. Ramu Kharel, an Assistant Professor of Emergency Medicine at Brown University in the USA, who led this collaboration for a poison information centre in Nepal reflected on the journey and called for future support. “This project began as a pilot to assess the feasibility of establishing the first institutional poison information center in Nepal, and we are proud to say that we have demonstrated that this is indeed feasible, ” said Kharel. “For continued sustainability of this programme, the Nepali government must take the lessons we have learned together and support this centre through funding.”He also said that along with finding ways to support service, concerned agencies also support Nepali doctors to get international opportunities to get trained in medical toxicology. Creating trained human resources in medical toxicology will provide the ultimate benefit for future sustainability of improved poisoning care in the country.  \nThe dengue menace shows no sign of going away as the deadly virus has now spread to almost all districts.Doctors warn that no one in Nepal is safe from the risk of infection, as the mosquito spreading the virus is present all over the country.What concerns them even more is that authorities have stopped preventive measures, including search and destroy drives, which are the only effective measures for cutting down the infection rate.The public’s fear of infection also appears to have diminished. “What can the public do when authorities take such risks lightly,” said Dr Baburam Marasini, a public health expert. “Any one of us could get infected by the virus at any time, and it does not make any difference to the government.”Dengue is a mosquito-borne viral disease transmitted by female Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes. The same vector also transmits chikungunya, yellow fever, and Zika, according to the World Health Organisation.So far this year, five people have died, and over 8,000 tested positive for the dengue virus, which has spread to 75 districts across the country. Officials admit that the real number of infections could be several times higher, as the government’s case reporting system is not very effective, and more than 80 percent of the cases are asymptomatic.Even symptomatic patients do not seek treatment unless they get severe. Many people infected with dengue show mild symptoms, which do not need any treatment or can be treated with paracetamol at home. Public health experts warn that dengue cases could escalate in the coming days as the peak season of the virus spread has just started.Experts emphasise the need for a massive awareness campaign for destroying the breeding ground of the dengue-spreading vector— and that the public must be made aware of the treatment.“Health authorities are not even implementing basic measures like launching an effective awareness drive to destroy the breeding sites of these vectors,” said Marasini. “The adult population is getting infected at workplaces, and children are being exposed at schools.”Experts say that the ongoing spread of dengue could have been prevented had the authorities taken the problem seriously and initiated a search-and-destroy drive. They say the disease will continue to spread unless lessons from previous outbreaks are effectively implemented.“Just counting the number of infected people will achieve nothing. Neither can we stop the spread of the virus nor determine the true extent of the outbreak,” said Dr Sher Bahadur Pun, chief of the Clinical Research Unit at Sukraraj Tropical and Infectious Disease Hospital. “Only those who suffer from severe dengue know how bad it is.”Dengue-transmitting mosquitoes breed in clean water and bite people in daylight. Uncovered water tanks and discarded objects such as plastic cups and bottles could be breeding grounds for dengue-carrying mosquitoes.According to doctors, mild to high fever, severe muscle pain, rashes, severe headache and pain in the eyes are some symptoms of dengue. Doctors advise that those with these symptoms seek immediate treatment. While there is no specific cure for the disease, early detection and access to proper medical care can lower fatalities.Nepal reported its first dengue case in a foreigner in 2004 in the Chitwan district. Since then, an increasing number of dengue infections and major outbreaks have been reported from many districts.Last year, at least 20 persons died and more than 52,000 were infected by the virus, which had spread to all 77 districts.In 2022, a total of 88 people died, and over 54,000 were infected by the virus across the country. In that period, hospitals in the Kathmandu Valley were overwhelmed with dengue patients, and pharmacies ran out of paracetamol, the most widely used medicine to treat fever.In 2019, the disease killed at least six people and more than 16,000 were hospitalised across the country. The virus had spread to 68 districts at the time.Though the post-monsoon period is considered the dengue epidemic season, the deadly disease has become endemic in Nepal, as outbreaks are reported every month, including in the winter months. \nDusit Princess Kathmandu is organising a five-day trout festival at its SOI restaurant. The dishes will be available for order from 12:30 pm to 10:00 pm every day till August 30. In celebration of Nepal’s rivers and lakes, which provide an ideal environment for high-quality trout, the Director of Culinary Food and Beverage Service, Chef Utpal Mondal, and his team at Dusit Princess Kathmandu have crafted a menu showcasing the flavours and versatility of locally sourced trout. “As the festive month of Shrawan ends, people focus on healthy and nutritious food. Trout, rich in omega-3 fatty acids, vitamins, and essential minerals, offers a heart-friendly option that checks all the boxes from a nutritional and culinary standpoint,” says Mondal.He adds that the goal of the culinary event is to offer their guests a rare opportunity to experience a wide variety of trout dishes they wouldn’t typically find at home.The event menu features twelve unique dishes, six of which are drawn from diverse culinary traditions across continents. Three dishes are inspired by oriental cuisine, while the remaining three highlight flavours from Nepal and India. The menu has been designed to include various dishes, from soups and starters to main courses, including Mexican, Italian, Continental, and Thai flavours.While discussing the event’s highlights, Mondal said, “The celebration presents a unique opportunity for guests to indulge in a diverse range of trout-based dishes, something they wouldn’t typically have the chance to experience elsewhere.” \nI can vividly remember my first encounter with baking when I was 10 years old. We had just moved to our new home and got a cable connection. The cable opened a world of possibilities, as it gave me access to various contents.This was back in the late 2000s when YouTube would take hours to load, taunting us with its buffering screen. I was particularly drawn to travel and lifestyle channels, mainly TLC, Fox Life, and Food Network, which kept me informed about different foods and cultures. I don’t know why, but I was always drawn to desserts. It was fascinating to see how these miraculous treats made people smile at the end of the meal.Growing up in Nepal, I noticed that baking wasn't very common. While some families did have ovens, they were mostly multifunctional ones used primarily for heating food.I also noticed that most of our desserts didn't require an oven, as they could be made on a stovetop. So, you can imagine my excitement when my mom decided to buy an oven during one of her festive shopping sprees.I could finally feel the joy these channels portrayed. (I blame food writer Nigella Lawson for getting me hooked on a domestic lifestyle.) Then, one day, after watching one of the cooking episodes on television, I finally mustered enough strength and decided to bake something. I distinctly remember wanting to make a chocolate cake for myself after watching one of Rachel Allen’s bake series. I watched all the ingredients used in that recipe and scurried across my pantry, only to realise I didn’t have half of the stuff she mentioned. I then decided to improvise the recipe (a big mistake). I randomly combined the ingredients that I had in a mixing bowl and chucked the batter into my oven, hoping for a magical cake to pop out an hour later.After I saw the result an hour later, I was mortified. The cake was stuck in the pan, refusing to come out, and it was as dense as fudge. I convinced myself that the taste was what mattered most, but when I served a slice to my brother, he made a face of utter disgust.That was the day I realised that baking soda was not the same as baking powder.After this incident, I researched baking and found out it was technical. This was a blessing in disguise for me, as I loved science, and I started to view baking as a science experiment. I then reflected and evaluated how to perfect one's baking skills.I analysed my errors and noted down all the steps I did every time I baked. Home baking is a passion for many. The idea of turning a few simple ingredients into a delicious masterpiece is as enchanting as it sounds.Yet, for many of us, this seemingly magical process can often turn into a series of unfortunate events, leading to crumbled dreams and deflated ambitions. Dense cakes, burnt crusts, rock-hard cookies and unrisen bread, if you are an amateur baker, then you have seen it all. But why do these mishaps happen so often? And most importantly how do we overcome them?From my experience, behind every successful bake lies a series of challenges and mishaps that test even the most dedicated bakers. Baking has its own set of rules that you need to follow to get that scrumptious treat every time. So, to transform a recipe into an actual dish that will impress your friends and family, I am sharing with you some of the tips and tricks I learned from my tumultuous journey as a home baker.First things first, we have to look into the prime appliance that we are working with. Commercial ovens are of two types: one that runs on gas and the other that runs on electricity. We have to look at the oven present at our home and consider its pros and cons. The main benefits of a gas oven are its size and temperature control. One can quickly change the temperature just by twisting the knob, and it preheats much more quickly than an electric one. However, they are known to have uneven temperatures at times and release more humidity, making it harder to properly crisp or brown food. This can result in burnt edges and cold or hot spots. An electric oven, on the other hand, provides more even and consistent temperatures and doesn’t release as much moisture in the air.This dry oven environment makes it easier to brown your items, making it great for baking bread. However, while the dry oven results in more even cooking, you also run the risk of drying out cakes and other baked goods.Also, many people forget to preheat the oven before baking, which is crucial for maintaining an even temperature throughout the baking process. When baking cakes and bread, I like to place a small tray of water at the bottom of the oven to provide moisture and prevent the baked goods from drying out.An oven thermometer can be a baker's best friend, providing a true reading and ensuring your creations bake evenly. I also like rotating the pan midway while baking, as it allows for an even distribution of heat.The next thing people mess up on is measuring and the specificity of ingredients in a recipe. Our moms made our food with their instinct; it is something that they learned along the way, but when you are baking, you cannot instinctively add or omit a few steps.I think that is why we initially had problems with baking. In a culture where cooking comes instinctually, baking challenges us, to be precise. A gram of more or less of any ingredient can drastically alter the outcome. Different methods of measuring flour can yield different results.Every component in baking serves a distinct purpose and function. Flour offers structure, sugar adds sweetness and moisture, eggs bind things together, and butter enhances taste and texture. However, not all ingredients are created equally. For example, using salted butter instead of unsalted might change the taste profile of your meal.Similarly, different flours have varying protein concentrations, which affect the texture of baked goods. The type of sugar used also makes a difference. Granulated sugar, brown sugar, powdered sugar, and speciality sugars like turbinado or muscovado each add unique flavours to a bake.Understanding these nuances and how they interact is critical for getting the intended outcomes. Accurate measurement tools and techniques are essential, but mastering them can be a steep learning curve. So, I would recommend investing in a kitchen scale that allows for more accurate measurements by weight rather than volume.Moving on, leavening agents such as baking soda, baking powder, and yeast are required to make baked goods rise. However, they can also cause confusion and errors. Baking soda needs an acidic component to activate, but baking powder has both an acid and a base, making it self-activating.Using the wrong type of flour or sugar, or using them in incorrect proportions, can result in flat, overly raised, or collapsed cakes. Yeast, being a living organism, presents its challenges.The water temperature must be just right—not too hot to kill the yeast, nor too cold to inhibit its activity. Proofing times and conditions also need to be carefully managed to achieve the perfect rise.Bakers should also be careful about the way they mix ingredients. The method of mixing ingredients can significantly impact the final product. Over-mixing can develop too much gluten in cakes and pastries, leading to tough textures.Under-mixing can leave pockets of unincorporated ingredients, resulting in uneven bakes. Techniques like folding, creaming, and whipping each serve specific purposes and must be executed with care.Finally, home bakers must understand the importance of timing and patience in baking. Even a minute or two can make the difference between perfectly baked cookies and burnt edges.Recipes often provide a range for baking times, but factors like oven hot spots, pan material, and altitude can affect these times. It’s crucial to keep a close eye on your bakes and rely on visual and tactile cues, such as a cake pulling away from the sides of the pan or a toothpick coming out clean, to determine doneness.Baking is also an exercise in patience, a virtue not everyone possesses. Doughs need time to rest and rise, flavours need time to meld, and baked goods need time to cool before they can be enjoyed.Impatience can lead to underbaked centres, crumbling slices, and a general sense of frustration. Cultivating patience is as important as mastering any technique in the baker’s repertoire.Home baking is a journey full of ups and downs, but it comes with great rewards. The obstacles encountered teach valuable lessons in patience, precision, and perseverance.The satisfaction of success, the freedom to create, and the therapeutic benefits make the endeavour meaningful. Whether baking for oneself, loved ones, or as an artistic outlet, the journey is as fulfilling as the result. Embrace the flour-dusted countertops, occasional setbacks, and the joys of home bakingFor a beginner-friendly recipe that involves mixing ingredients and delivers amazing results, try my recipe for fudgy, nutty brownies that I call ‘Bliss Brownies’.Bliss Brownies150g unsalted butter plus extra for the tin150g chopped dark chocolate200g caster sugar½ tsp baking powder2 eggs80g cocoa powder150g plain flour70g mixture of nuts (walnuts and almonds)60g blended papayaMix all the ingredients (except the dark chocolate and nuts) in a blender or a food processor and blitz till you get a smooth paste.Fold the chocolate and the nuts into the brownie batter, making sure that the pieces are evenly mixed in.Grease a loaf pan with soft butter and dust with cocoa powder. Pour the batter into the loaf pan.Bake in a preheated oven at 170c for 40 minutes and let it cool in the oven for an hour. Enjoy with a cup of coffee or, as I like it, a scoop of vanilla ice cream. \nIn a world where acceptance and safety often seem difficult to attain, many queer individuals also struggle to find a safe space to express themselves. They have to hide their true self and face relentless judgement when going to public places like cafes and restaurants.This is the reality for countless LGBTQIA+ individuals. The need for a safe space for this community is not just a desire but a necessity—a space where one can be themselves. This struggle for safety and acceptance can be traced to crucial historical moments, such as the Stonewall Riots of 1969 in New York City.The Stonewall Inn was more than a bar; it was a refuge for the queer community. When police raided the bar, the community fought back. This series of violent confrontations, which began in the early hours of June 28, 1969, between police and gay rights activists, marked the beginning of the modern LGBTQIA+ rights movement. The spirit of Stonewall, the fight for dignity and the right to exist openly lives on in places like Inclusive Galaxy Restaurant in Kathmandu. Inclusive Galaxy beyond a restaurant is an ‘oasis’ for the queer community and beyond.Founded by Bishwaraj Adhikari, Mr Gay Handsome Nepal 2013, a human rights defender, the restaurant proves the power of safe spaces. It’s a place where the community can unite, free from the prejudice and hostility that often permeate their everyday lives.After years of working in the human rights sector, Adhikari and his partner developed the idea for Inclusive Galaxy. What began as a small cafe gradually evolved into a full-fledged restaurant, driven by the growing demand and support from the community.“In developed countries with strong LGBTQIA+ movements, you can find community areas like gay villages. These are created as safe spaces for people whose families and communities have excluded them. They also support new business ideas and pink tourism. I hope to see pink tourism develop in Nepal someday,” says Adhikari. His vision for Inclusive Galaxy goes beyond just being a restaurant. He aims to promote financial independence and empowerment within the queer community.Since its inception in February 2019, Inclusive Galaxy has become a key spot for many in Lazimpat, a relatively queer-friendly area in Kathmandu. The location is essential because the first LGBTQIA+ movement in Nepal started in 2001 through the Blue Diamond Society.Inclusive Galaxy, true to its name, welcomes everyone—queer and non-queer alike—to share a comfortable space. His vision was clear: to create a space where people of all genders and sexual identities could come together without fear of exclusion.“I didn’t want to make it exclusively for queer people because that would be excluding ourselves from society. Different groups need to live together and understand each other,” Adhikari explains.In the early days, the cafe attracted both queer and non-queer customers. However, when some of the residents learned about Adhikari’s identity and the nature of the clientele, there was a brief period of hesitation. “At first, I didn’t understand what was happening, but then I realised my identity was an issue for a few people. I believe people should be judged by others by their character, not by their gender or sexuality. Over time, as residents saw that we operated like any other cafe, they became more comfortable,” Adhikari reflects.Adhikari started Inclusive Galaxy to give queer individuals a place to be proud of themselves, counteracting the self-doubt and insecurity that hiding one’s identity can cause. This turned the cafe very quickly into a community hub. The journey was not without challenges, though. It was difficult to hire staff and cooks from the LGBTQIA+ community, and soon after the restaurant opened, the COVID pandemic made things even harder.Despite these difficulties, the doors of Inclusive Galaxy remained open. During the pandemic, many queer individuals, who were abandoned by their families or afraid to return home, found comfort at Inclusive Galaxy.Since many couldn’t afford to pay for meals, the restaurant provided free food from its resources. As the number of people needing meals grew to 20-30 daily, Adhikari started raising funds within the community.“During my time as an activist, many people came here not only for food but also to see an organisation where the queer community supports one another,” Adhikari says.“The time during COVID was difficult, but it brought me closer to the community.”Four years after its inception, the restaurant has garnered a loyal following. Sarosy Neupane, Miss Pink Nepal 2024 first runner-up, describes Inclusive Galaxy as her second home. She moved to Kathmandu to study in 2022. Being distant from her family, she started visiting Galaxy for meals that reminded her of home-cooked food. Over time, she grew attached to the café because of its welcoming atmosphere.“It’s heartwarming to see people from our community and different walks of life here. The founders even invite us to festivals like ‘Dahi Chiura Khane din,’” she shares.Neupane visits the cafe regularly and sometimes stays until 3 am, engrossed in conversations. “I hope more spaces like this can open in the future. If, unfortunately, this place were to close someday, I don’t think we’d have any other place to turn to,” she adds.Muna Chhetri, a trans woman who has been a loyal customer for three years, shares, “This is my safe space where I can truly be myself. I always feel judged in other restaurants, but that fear doesn’t exist here. It’s where even those who aren’t accepted at home can feel accepted.”Sahara Khadka Chhetri, owner of Pink Tiffany, Kathmandu’s first openly LGBTIQIA+ friendly restaurant and bar, frequently visits after managing the bar, appreciating the convenience of not cooking at home.She notes very few places like this cater to our community, and some even had to close during COVID. “As an entrepreneur, I know that sustaining these spaces is a challenge. But as more spaces like these open, they will make the way for a more inclusive and compassionate society.”The welcoming atmosphere at Inclusive Galaxy has also had a surprising effect on non-queer patrons. Samriddha Jung Rana, a twenty-year-old neighbour who identifies as straight, often visits the café and appreciates the importance of such spaces.“Previously, I didn’t know much about the queer community and didn’t care much. But now, coming into this café, I’ve been interested in their rights and issues. I’ve realised that we’re not so different after all. We are all human,” he remarks.The ventures like Inclusive Galaxy and Pink Tiffany have inspired hope for collaborative businesses between queer and non-queer groups. The recent initiative by the Nepal Tourism Board promoting Pink Tourism in April 2024 is a positive step. Still, Adhikari believes that more support is needed from the government and the private sector.Despite the progress, challenges remain. However, Adhikari remains optimistic about the future. He is working on plans to develop the restaurant into a homestay program in the future.“Like how different planets, asteroids, and stars make up a beautiful galaxy, people from all walks of life and identities make a beautiful society. I am happy that we are assimilating together in this space. We are not so different; we are all different and similar simultaneously,” he says. \nAditya Mishra is a Nepali chef and entrepreneur based in New York. Passionate about elevating Nepali cuisine globally, Mishra sharpened his culinary skills while staging at various Michelin-starred restaurants in the city during his time at culinary school. A recipient of the James Beard Foundation National Scholars Scholarship in 2023, Mishra’s early experiences inspired him to establish his own supper club, ‘The Sewing Tin’, alongside co-founder Akhil Upad.In an interview with Post’s Aarati Ray, Mishra discusses his restaurant in New York, serving Nepali cuisines there and the recipe for his signature dish.How did your cooking journey start in New York?At 14, I told my parents I wanted to be a chef, but they preferred I pursue a stable career like engineering, as many Nepali families do. So, I left for Louisiana in 2019 to study engineering.But, cooking never left my heart so, after a year, I left engineering college and moved to New York City. It’s been three and a half years and my parents only learned about it later. When my mom visited me in NYC and saw my dedication to cooking, she saw my passion and supported my decision.What sparked your interest in cooking from a young age?As a child, I was drawn to cooking shows on TLC. The glamour of cooking, eating, travelling and the prosperity of famous chefs was fascinating.Around age 16, I discovered Chef Anthony Bourdain’s groundbreaking book, ‘Kitchen Confidential’, which shed light on the reality of the culinary industry. I learned how he became a cultural icon in NYC, reshaping perceptions of chefs.I was also fascinated by chefs like Marco Pierre White, who was a mentor to Gordon Ramsay. Their stories of achieving fame while maintaining discipline intrigued me. But, as I grew older and entered the culinary world, I realised it was far from glamorous—it involved dedication and I am glad I persevered.How did the idea for The Sewing Tin originate?The concept of ‘The Sewing Tin’ came when I realised the stark contrast between the romanticised view of kitchen work and its harsh reality. Witnessing the struggles of many kitchen staff—economic hardships, immigration challenges and language barriers—I had to rediscover my love for cooking.During my internship at ‘Junoon’ restaurant, I met my co-founder, Akhil Upad, who shared my culinary enthusiasm despite his preparations for medical college. Together, we wanted to create a dining experience that was more personal and communal, offering fine dining with a sense of community.We wanted our food to tell stories, so we named our restaurant ‘The Sewing Tin’ inspired by the immigrant experience in NYC. When immigrants opened cookie boxes as kids, they often found sewing supplies instead of food.‘The Sewing Tin’ is like opening a cookie box and finding sewing supplies—something uniquely desi, or South Asian. How do you promote Nepali cuisine in New York City through The Sewing Tin?My partner is from Atlanta with Indian roots, while I come from Nepal, so our menu celebrates and reflects both cultures and heritage.We represent our respective cultures authentically. For example, we have a dish inspired by Newari cuisine called kachaila, similar to French Tartar. We present it as Tartar to make it accessible to our customers but infuse it with Nepali flavours, telling stories about its origins and giving diners a taste of my homeland.What do you think of the prospects of Nepali cuisine abroad?I’m on a mission to share Nepali food worldwide. I have served up dishes like chatamari and lamb sekuwa in my restaurant. But I’m still learning and want to explore more of Nepal’s cuisines. My big dream? To make Nepali cuisine reach more places because it’s got something special that can wow taste buds everywhere.How do you see the changes in restaurants in Nepal?The restaurant industry has deep roots in community and bringing people together, dating back centuries. While this core idea remains, modern restaurants have evolved, making changes to adapt to the times.Yet, in Nepal, despite the growing number of restaurants, many lack uniqueness and storytelling, focusing more on making money than fostering a sense of community.I’ve noticed a troubling trend of rising prices, especially for beloved dishes like momos, which makes people question if they're getting value for their money. It seems like profits are taking precedence over creating genuine, authentic culinary experiences.The industry is starting to lose the creativity and passion that once made it special. It might be time for chefs to shake things up, challenge the norm and bring fresh ideas to the table, revitalising the culinary scene with renewed energy and creativity.What challenges have you faced in New York as an outsider?Living in a bustling city like New York as an outsider has its challenges. But, this city is also full of opportunities for those who are passionate. If you stay true to your culture and want to share your story, opportunities are waiting for you.Even though it can be daunting because of the tough competition, the city appreciates determination and expertise. When I started my journey here, all I wanted to do was cook, eat and share the story of Nepal and its diverse cultures. Instead of focusing on the difficulties, I embraced the chance to follow my passion.What do you think about the criticism of blending Nepali food with modern culinary styles?Chefs care about their food—it’s like they’re sharing a story. They’ve put in a lot of effort to become skilled, so let them be creative. It’s okay to give helpful advice but don’t be mean just to criticise. Chefs shouldn’t also just copy what’s popular, they should cook what they truly love. That’s what makes food special and meaningful.Mishra’s signature dish:Confit Duck Chatamari A traditional Nepali delicacy with French influence.Ingredients:Duck (Legs and breast)Rice (soaked overnight)MayonnaiseWhole spices (cloves, cinnamon, cardamom, bay leaf)Red onionGarlicGingerMula ko achar (Fermented radish)ScallionsLemon juiceNepali pepperVinegarSaltSugarProcedure:For the Duck:Season duck with salt and pepper.Cook in a covered pan with whole spices, garlic, and ginger at low heat for 2 hours on a stove (270 degrees in the oven)Increase heat to crisp up the skin (approximately 15 minutes).Shred the duck meat.Confit Garlic Aioli:Mash cooked garlic and ginger and mix with mayonnaise, lemon juice, Nepali pepper and fermented radishes.Pickled Onions:Slice onions and cook in a mixture of vinegar, water, salt, sugar, and whole spices until softened (about 10 minutes).For the chatamari:Blend soaked rice to make a batter, let it ferment for 6 hours, and adjust consistency with water.Assembling:Cook chatamari batter in duck fat for 4 minutes.Top with shredded duck, aioli, pickled onions and scallions.Serve \nCeleus Baral exudes a serene aura when you meet her, and when she tells you she bakes, it makes sense. Even during a brief encounter, you can tell she has the patience needed to be a baker.“You can eyeball cooking, but baking is chemistry. You have to be meticulous. You cannot rush it, or it does not turn out as expected,” says the 21-year-old environment science student. She also runs the online baking shop Bakeleus. Recently, she has also started selling her baked goods beyond her online shop, with her first stall appearing at The Yellow House’s Night Market. Bakeleus’s menu lists a variety of offerings, including jams, granola, tarts, cakes, cookies, cupcakes and brownies. Baral began baking in 2020, during the lockdown, and launched her online shop last year.She grows much of the produce she incorporates into her baking, and believes we should all understand the origins of our food. “This connection fosters gratitude and a deeper appreciation for nature,” she says. Her background in environmental science, coupled with her affinity for the natural world, imbues her creations with a unique artistic sensibility. Each item she bakes is a testament to her creativity and experimentation, as she believes consistent practice is the key to mastery.Despite the demands of being a full-time student, Baral strives to accommodate orders, typically requiring a minimum of 72 hours' notice for delivery. She is a passionate and discerning individual, evident in the love she infuses into her baking. Additionally, Baral advocates for a zero-waste policy at home, ensuring that every scrap of food and all household items are recycled.Three easy to bake recipes you can try at homeMini carrot cakes Ingredients:38 g milk or yoghurt35 g all-purpose flour1/4 tea spoon ground cinnamon1/8 tea spoon ground gingerA pinch of cardamom1 tea spoon baking powder½ tea spoon fine sea salt2 large eggs, at room temperature27 g granulated sugar13 g brown sugar (or 39 g of regular granulated sugar)1 tea spoon vanilla extract27 g extra virgin olive oil33 g carrots, peeled and shreddedChopped walnutsCandied lemon or orange slices (optional for garnish)Cream cheese frosting56.5 g unsalted butter, softened113.5 g cream cheese, softened1/2 teaspoon vanilla extractA pinch of salt250 g powdered sugarDirections:For the cake:Preheat the oven to 195°C.

Yet, pockets of the past remain—small, peaceful neighbourhoods where houses are still made of wood, paths are made of stone tiles, and the stillness of a world that wants to stay intact and immobile. These places are known for tourism, culture, and the restoration of community pride. One such stop is the quiet village of Khokana in southern Lalitpur.Khokana is comparatively close to the mainland urban Lalitpur; from the ring road junction of Bagdole, it takes only a 10-minute drive to reach there. From the airport, you can take a cab directly to Khokana, which will take around half an hour. Get your cameras and hiking boots ready; the area is filled with historical artefacts and hiking trails.However, it is vastly different from the city. It is much nearer to the hills, where stone-paved paths, which could easily be goat trails, are rare in today’s Kathmandu.One such goat trail leads to Sikali temple, a major attraction of the area and accessible only on foot. The pavements are lined with big and small temples on each side, along with ponds that serve as clean water sources and a location for religious rituals. The houses are made of bricks and wood. The concrete invasion, although present, is minimal. Scattered every few hundred metres are small mustard oil mills, co-operative businesses of the locals of Khokana that have existed since medieval times.A site well-recognised for its historical significance, Khokana was even proposed to be made a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1996. Sikali TempleAround an hour’s walk from the historic town, Sikali Temple can be reached, which is also the location for its famed Sikali Jatra.While it can be reached through any public vehicle, a more holistic and adventurous route is to follow the goat trails on the outskirts of Khokana. This route, albeit long, allows for great hiking opportunities, scenic views of the hills surrounding the Kathmandu Valley, and a close-up view of the mediaeval but well-maintained architecture of the local houses.Even if you lose the way, which is very possible, the locals are very welcoming and more than willing to guide you. The main temple itself is three stories tall, and built in the Pagoda style, a common style in many temples in the valley.It is surrounded by a lush grass field which plays the stage to the Sikali Jatra held every year. The temple, like many religious spots around Khokana, is dedicated to the local deity Shree Rudrayani.The Sikali Jatra, a five-day festival that serves as an alternative to Dashain for the Khokana locals, is filled with chariot dances, battle enactments, and storytelling celebrations in the worship of Goddess Rudrayani.Starting from Ghatasthapana in mid to late September, the Jatra is vibrant and an essential experience for every visitor. Historical Khokana townKhokana’s historical town is located around 5 minutes walking distance from the local bus park. The town complex, paved with hand-made stone tiles, is graced with the Indrayanee temple but also has many red-bricked houses built in the local Newari architecture, some of them centuries old.One such house is the ‘Khokana Museum’. Although closed, it is widely popular for being the first house to be lit with electricity in Nepal, as Chandra Shamsher did in 1911.The stand-holder of the first light bulb can still be seen, serving as a historical monument for everyone to see.Similarly, the town complex is also filled with Guthi houses, small ponds, and even the local Ward office. While the Ward office provides a wealth of information for visitors interested in the area’s history, the Guthi halls symbolise the strong community support culture of the locals.The ponds, a notable one present right opposite the Indrayanee temple, have stone taps and remind us of primitive ways of obtaining clean water—a practice many locals are still engaged in.Yet, these ponds are also religious locations, especially used in rituals in the Sikali Jatra.Finally, a stroll through the complex allows visitors to explore old houses and historical artefacts in the serene quietness of Khokana, while the small outlets and Choila places nearby allow you to enjoy the spicy duck or chicken delicacies at the same time.Overall, the historical complex is enough to transport visitors back to a glimpse of the medieval past of the Kathmandu Valley. Mustard oil millsThe most well-known feature of Khokana is its mustard oil mills, which have been operational for hundreds of years and have been using the same methods of preparation since their inception.These mills, scattered throughout Khokana, are often community-owned, and even the ones owned by certain individuals have almost exclusively employed locals.Despite the advent of modern machinery, there is still substantial demand for their products due to the assured guarantee.When I visited one such mill, the local staff informed me that the furnace and oil presser used by them were 300 years old, given by the Patan royalty even before the Shahs became king.In addition to buying pure, organically created mustard oil and pellets, visiting these oil mills offers many educational benefits for international and local tourists alike.Khokana offers visitors a unique glimpse into a preserved bubble of the past through its tranquillity, preservation of ancient lifestyle and cultural elements, and remarkable self-sustenance.  \n“How much oxygen do you have for the summit?”I think this is the kind of question a film producer would ask. But when you're on the mountain, the answer is never clear.I have worked for a long time in the film industry and different art areas, especially photography and engraving.Working in various fields and drawing inspiration from them has become a new normal for me. I have made this approach my way of life without even realising it.I took responsibility for producing the last movie I worked on and shot the behind-the-scenes footage for a documentary. By doing so, I witnessed the entire shooting process and the journey of a movie.In the snowy highlands of Turkey, we had to endure the consequences of the changing climate to shoot ‘About Dry Grasses’, directed by Nuri Bilge Ceylan. The highlands used to be snowy in January, but by the time we got there in the same month, there was no snow. Nature was changing. It was responding to what was happening—to what humanity had done to it. In the end, it snowed, and we shot the intense snow scenes we wanted. But since most of our days were sunny, unlike what the director wanted, we had to shoot in the sunset and sunrise hours. As crew members, we spent many days waiting for the sun to set.Production requires creating opportunities, finding solutions, and being creative for a work of art to come true. For this, patience, endurance, calmness, and timing are necessary. On the other hand, nature wanted us to listen to it and wait for the right time.During that time, I witnessed many of nature's lessons. For example, I experienced extreme cold for the first time. We endured temperatures ranging from -33 degrees to +55 degrees. By listening to nature, surrendering to its forces, and working within its limits, we managed to persevere.No matter how much you prepare or plan during the pre-production phase, if you are working in nature, remember that nature will always have the final say.The film was completed, released, and connected with audiences. Its success at Cannes 2023 was followed by my trip to the North Pole for my project. I returned with a mix of wonderful developments, joys, and challenges. During this process, I experienced life and death, happiness and sadness, losses and awards.I realised the value of being able to breathe comfortably a few days after my father's chemotherapy ended. Just a few days earlier, he had said, \"Well done, my daughter. I'm glad you went!\" All the anxiety and hard work, filled with fears at the beginning, were finally behind me.Before going to Everest, when I was on the verge of giving up, defeated by my fears, I remembered my father's words. Everest reminded me of what he said while struggling to breathe, adding a turning point to my life.What does it mean to say ‘life’s turning point?’ How many turning points can there be in life?Who am I, and what am I doing in this world? How well do I know my own limits? Can I find answers to these big questions? These thoughts sparked my dream of journeying to Everest. Now, after returning, I can say that it turned my life around.“How much oxygen do you need for the summit?” sounds more like “How much do you need to hold on to life?” How many reasons do you find that give meaning to your life, keep you alive, and allow you to breathe? How much can you endure in the face of obstacles, and can you keep believing that a solution will eventually come your way?Can these questions be separated from the idea of measuring and assessing something, from learning its quantity and financial value? Can everything be known with certainty? Should the journey be fully understood in advance, with all its promises laid out? Should it be viewed like a purchase with a price tag, asking, “Is this journey worth this much?”I had never trekked before and had no climbing experience. I had lived at sea level my entire life and had never been to a high altitude.However, this journey was not only about the physical climb but also an inner discovery. After losing my father to lung cancer, his breathing difficulties taught me the fragility of breath, life, and existence. I also mentally prepared myself for the physical challenges I might face. Despite all my concerns, could this journey help me understand the cycle of life and the resilience of the soul?So, how could I make this trek possible? How could I land in Nepal? Despite all the economic difficulties and the many things I felt needed organising, I did my best and believed in it.Since I was embarking on this journey, I felt I should share about my travels and inspire others.Starting with photography, cinema, and engraving, which are already integral parts of my life, I dreamed of documenting and sharing the inspiring aspects of this journey.After months of correspondence and dreaming, it all came true. Finally, I embarked on the journey with the goal of creating photographs, engravings, and documentaries. I learned a great deal from my travels in Nepal, from the people I met, and from every moments I witnessed. I felt incredibly fortunate to have been able to honour my father’s memory with the peace and serenity I experienced in the Himalayas.During my 15-day journey to Everest Base Camp, I encountered nature’s masterpieces at every turn. As concerns like “How will I endure?” and “How will I finish?” started to weigh on me, the mountains suddenly parted with the clouds and gazed down at me.It was amazing to witness the appearance of ‘Gods’ that I had never seen before, in such immense size and in such a close, awe-inspiring manner beside me during that silent walk.As someone who came from one of the most crowded cities in the world, Istanbul, while I struggled with my daily questions and uncertainties, trying to control everything, they stood there calmly, as if answering me.They were just there—before and after.My guide, Lakhpa Sherpa, always reminded me not to worry about how high we were, how long it would take to reach our accommodation, or what the weather would be like. He encouraged me to live in the moment, and he was right.He advised me to focus on my breathing, not to get thirsty, to eat enough, and to appreciate the extraordinary beauty of the journey. In the mountains, plans dissolve and each moment is embraced as it comes.All the good wishes, prayers, and everything encountered along the way were for the journey itself. The mountain was full of life, secrets, and everything I had wondered about.This 15-day journey to Everest Base Camp was a solo adventure, yet I wouldn't have been able to complete it without my guide, Lhakpa, and my porter. Additionally, I was fortunate enough to experience the hospitality, generosity, and honesty at Trekkers Paradise, which organised the entire journey and provided guidance.I witnessed how dedication and sincerity are crucial in completing a journey safely and healthily. Ghanshyam Sharma, from Trekkers Paradise and Sauraj Jhingan, a climber who summited the Everest in 2018, shared their experiences with me during the journey.They experienced the 2015 earthquake while they were at the Everest Base Camp.As a filmmaker, their role as actors, and attention to detail played a significant role in bringing my dream photography and documentary project to life.The sponsors of my journey were Turkish Airlines, The North Face, Apple, Canon, and Stanley. My supporters include Oscar International College and Nepal Film Campus. Throughout the journey, I shared many experiences, memories, and countless photos and images with my students.On my way back home after 21 days, I celebrated my birthday on the plane. From the right window, the Himalayas bid me farewell. I felt like I had opened a new chapter in my life, and I was certain that I would return.I had made many friends and memories in Nepal.For now, I will be working on a documentary and preparing for a photography and engraving exhibition titled ‘My Soul Beyond the Mountain’.To the Himalayas: This summer was spent with you, but we will meet again soon. \nWe spent five days in Sri Lanka two weeks ago, driving up and down the island, covering almost 70 percent of its territory. Our tour spanned over 1,000 kilometres, including hills, beach spots, and heritage and religious sites.Our first stop in Sri Lanka was Colombo’s Bandaranaike International Airport. We were greeted by a warm and humid breeze when we exited the airport. The host briefed us (a group of journalists) that heavy rainfall has affected areas across Sri Lanka since mid-May 2024. Rain and storms intensified on June 1, with the most significant effects in the south and west of the country. We were lucky to have no rain in the forecast.On the first night, we checked into the lavish Jetwing Lake resort, an opulent sanctuary amidst the lush landscape. The resort’s expansive grounds were a retreat, offering a glimpse of Sri Lanka's natural beauty. We feasted on delicious cuisine, every bite exploding with flavour, introducing us to the island’s famed culinary delights. On June 7, early morning, the sun shone brightly, previewing the promise of an incredible journey ahead. We set off early the following day, eager to explore the mysteries of this enchanting island. As we ventured further into the heart of Sri Lanka, the landscape revealed its majestic nature. We were astounded by seeing Pidurangala Rock, a 200-metre-high granite colossus just a kilometre north of Sigiriya. The short hike to Pidurangala Rock offered breathtaking views of Sigiriya and beyond. We climbed the steep steps and soon were rewarded with a breathtaking panoramic view of the surrounding landscape. It took us 30 minutes to climb. The sight took our breaths away and left us humbled in the presence of such grandeur. From the top are glorious vistas of the surrounding landscape and an incredible view of the majestic Sigiriya Rock. From there, Sigiriya Lion’s Rock is visible, standing alone. This was the place where demon king Ravana had his palace in the Treta Yuga. Believed to have been built 50 centuries ago, the palace is said to have had a unique lift for Ravana and his visitors. Ravana imprisoned Sita in one of the caves at the bottom of this humongous boulder. Sigiriya is a fifth-century fortress in Sri Lanka carved out of an inselberg, a hill of hard volcanic rock that soared high above the surrounding jungle. We spent two hours atop the rock, mainly taking photographs. We descended from Pidurangala Rock, filled with awe and a sense of accomplishment.The journey ahead seemed even more enticing as we ventured along the winding roads, heading towards our next destination.Cash-strapped Sri Lanka plunged into its worst financial crisis in more than seven decades in 2022, with a severe dollar shortage sending inflation soaring to a high of 70 percent, its currency to record lows, and its economy contracting 7.3 percent.Thanks to the growing number of tourists, Sri Lanka is now bouncing back.In Jetwing Lake, we met Kasun Pradeep Somasiri, a receptionist. He briefed us that the resort is now 50 percent occupied. “That’s a better figure now as we are recovering.”The travel and tourism sector is a significant income generator for Sri Lanka. However, the economic crisis, the Ukraine–Russia war, and China’s zero-Covid policy have jeopardised the industry.Tourism accounted for more than 12 percent of the country’s GDP in 2019 and was the third-largest source of foreign exchange reserves, behind worker remittances and the apparel industry.Sri Lanka was poised to be one of the world’s best holiday destinations due to its rich culture, wealth of natural resources, and diversity of accessible experiences.However, tourism-dependent Sri Lanka suffered its first major setback with the Easter bombings 2019. This led to the collapse of inbound tourism flows as international arrivals declined by 18 percent year-on-year, and tourist expenditure fell by 17.7 percent that year. This was immediately followed by two years of pandemic restrictions. Inbound visitors fell to just 116,600 in 2021.An acute balance of payments crisis forced Sri Lanka to preemptively default on foreign debt of over $50 billion in April 2022, triggering a crippling economic contraction with spiralling inflation.“Tourism is gaining momentum,” says Somasiri. “The British and Chinese have started to return to Sri Lanka.”January-August is the peak season for foreigners. “From December to April, local people travel for holiday purposes,” says Somasiri. Before we started the tour to other religious sites, our tour guide, Sampath Mayadunne, told us, “Don't take selfies with your back to Buddha.” Turning your back on a Buddha statue and some other religious sites to take photos and videos is a strict no-no.The most common sight across Sri Lanka is the tank cascades system, an ancient irrigation infrastructure. The system is a network of small tanks draining to large reservoirs that store rainwater and surface runoff for later use.“These infrastructures were built by its ancient kings over 2,000 years ago to solve the water scarcity in the country’s dry zone,” says Mayadunne.On day two, we travelled to Ranweli Spice Garden in Matale. This garden is famous for its rare spices and herbs. A tour of the gardens will show you the cultivation, harvesting, cleaning, and packaging process, as well as the health benefits and uses of the herbs.On the way, we saw a colourful Muthumariamman Hindu temple, boasting hundreds of detailed sculptures in a rich mosaic of colour.In Kandy, we visited the Temple of the Tooth Relic (Sri Dalada Maligawa), one of the most sacred places of worship in the Buddhist world. It was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1988.The temple sustained damage from bombings by Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna in 1989 and by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam in 1998. However, it was fully restored each time.We then headed to Jetwing St Andrew’s, a luxurious 5-star property in Sri Lanka’s hill country of Nuwara Eliya, situated at 1,900 metres above sea level. During our stay in Kandy, we immersed ourselves in the city's charm and the serenity of the countryside. On the third day, early morning, we travelled to Nuwara Eliya, the area famous for tea estates that give many Nepalis the feeling that they have come to Kanyam, Ilam, in eastern Nepal.We visited a tea factory called Damro Labookellie Tea Centre, the oldest tea centre in Sri Lanka. Due to its cold climate, it is the most important area for tea production in Sri Lanka.In this tea factory, they make white and black tea, while the green tea is processed in another tea factory and then sent to Damro.After the tea factory tour and the tea tasting, we headed to Galle, our next resting point.We encountered narrow, winding, and maze-like streets and alleys in Nuwara Eliya, known as ‘Little England’. The town has preserved almost all its British-era buildings and is calm and beautiful. On our way to Galle, at the roadside, our tour guide stopped us at the famed Sita temple, which has Hanuman's footprints and is the place where Sita, wife of Lord Rama, was held captive by the demon king Ravana after he abducted her from India.We were at Sita Eliya, a temple named Sri Seethai Amman.When we reached the Hindu temple, rich in vibrant colours and architectural elements, it was full of devotees. The water stream adjoining the temple is believed to be where Sita bathed. Large footprints are found on the stones in the stream, and there is a saying that those belong to Hanuman, who came spying to find Sita’s whereabouts.In Ella, Ravana’s waterfalls are significant in the Rama-Ravana story. The cascade charms visitors from all over the globe. The waterfall is easily accessible and is known to have hidden caves at the top, which are believed to have been used as Ravana's residence.The 25-metre-tall waterfall is a beautiful cascade that provides the perfect backdrop for a photo to remember your Ramayana trail adventures in Sri Lanka. A short pilgrimage tour ended there, and it was now time for an adventure. Though it was not part of our itinerary, our guide decided to tour us on a train ride.Though short, only six kilometres from Ella to Demodera, it was thrilling. Everyone screamed in unison like kids on a fair ride to hear the echoes in the dark every time we passed through the tunnels. The sound of the train is subtly different inside a tunnel. For the first-timer, the darkness and shouts inside the tunnels when the train passes would be scary, like a horror movie.The train we boarded wasn’t crowded, but people had already filled the doorway, ready for the scenic journey.With the shrill sound of a whistle, the train slowly pulled away from the platform at Ella, passing houses, coconut trees and green fields.As the train progressed, tourists and locals were leaning out the windows and crowding to hang out the doors. I joined the crowd and hung out on a train. A short excitement ended there.After lunch, we headed to Galle and reached Jetwing Lighthouse. As soon as our group entered the hotel, they shouted with excitement.The hotel is on a rocky outcrop three miles west of Galle. Waves crash over giant boulders in front of it and produce howling winds.We were at Galle’s 17th-century fort five minutes from the hotel on day four. In the Bay of Galle on the southwest coast of Sri Lanka, Galle Fort was built first in 1588 by the Portuguese and lavishly rebuilt by the Dutch during the 17th century. It is a historical, archaeological and architectural heritage monument that maintains a perfect appearance even after more than 436 years.We then reached Hikkaduwa Beach, a popular beach destination on the southern coast of Sri Lanka. On the way, we saw a 30-metre-high Big Buddha Statue. It is a replica of the 6th-century Buddhas of Bamiyan destroyed by the Taliban in Afghanistan. It was created using the earliest known sketches of the statue. It was built in remembrance of the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami victims.We then travelled through the 222-kilometre-long Southern Expressway, Sri Lanka's first expressway linking the capital, Colombo, with Galle, Matara, and Hambantota, significant cities south of the island.On day five, we reached Colombo, the capital of Sri Lanka. Jetwing Colombo Seven hosted us in the bustling capital. We took a city tour early morning and visited Bally's Casino at night.On day six, we returned to Kathmandu early in the morning on a Sri Lankan Airlines flight, the airline that organised the trip in coordination with Jetwing Hotels Limited, a Sri Lankan hotel chain.National flag carrier Nepal Airlines, in its previous avatar as Royal Nepal Airlines, used to operate direct flights to Colombo during the 1980s. However, the carrier suspended operations following an armed movement by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) in Sri Lanka. There had been no direct air links between the two countries for decades.In 2016, Himalaya Airlines started a chartered flight that lasted a few months due to low traffic movement between the two countries. Sri Lankan Airlines started operating direct flights to Kathmandu in August 2021.“The main objective of this media tour is to increase tourism in both countries for mutual benefit. We want to draw Nepalis for pilgrims and leisure activities,” says Nilina Pathirana, Country Manager at Srilankan Airlines in Nepal.“We have understood that Nepali travellers tend to travel to Bangkok, Vietnam, Malaysia, Dubai, and Maldives. Nepalis have quite minimal knowledge about Sri Lanka and the religious connection between Lanka and Nepal. We want to promote Nepal and Sri Lanka jointly. This will be a win-win business,” added Pathirana.The airline said it currently carries 60 percent of the passengers from Nepal to Sri Lanka and beyond destinations like Tokyo, Sydney, Melbourne, and other Middle Eastern destinations. The return airfare for a 3.5-hour-long flight starts at Rs74,000. “We have a four-night, five-day package that begins from Rs80,000, depending on the properties and extended itineraries,” says Pathirana.Nepalis must submit certain required documents for visa processing, like their passport copy and bank statement. Due to this government-to-government policy, only Nepalis must obtain a prior visa. Otherwise, Sri Lankans are required to have a visa upon arrival.“The other best thing is that Sri Lankan Airlines can be involved with the visa process or facilitate the Nepalis tourists. Our main intention is to have a sustainable market in Kathmandu and make it a daily flight,” says Pathirana. \nMundhum Trek in Koshi province in the eastern part of Nepal is a new cultural walking trail. It passes through several indigenous ethnic villages and landscapes in Khotang and Bhojpur districts. This trail goes up to an elevation of 4,200 metres to the viewpoint of Silchung Peak and takes one through the settlements of the Kirati people. This route starts from Diktel Bazaar and passes through beautiful settlements like Chakhewa, Rawa Dhap, Salpa Bhanjyang, Silchung and Hanspokhari before ending in Bhojpur. There are some hotels in Diktel but trekkers are advised to carry tents. The trail offers panoramic views of most of the eight-thousanders, including Everest, Lhotse, Makalu, Cho Oyu and Kanchenjunga mountains. The spring season, March through May, is highly recommended for the trek.Janaki Mandir Janaki Mandir at Janakpur in Madhesh province was constructed in 1874 and is a blend of Mughal and local architecture. The temple is a three-storey building and has 60 rooms, making it the largest temple in Nepal. Pilgrims flock here by the thousands to pay homage to Janaki Mandir—Janaki being the other name of Sita, the daughter of King Janak. The temple houses an idol of Sita which was found near Ayodhya, the kingdom of Ram. The marriage anniversary of Lord Ram and Sita is celebrated in Janakpur every year on Vivaha Panchami, which falls in December. In the southwest corner of Janaki Mandir is the Vivaha Mandap, which has been built at the site where the marriage of Ram and Sita is said to have taken place. Another well-known temple in the vicinity is Ram Mandir, which is built in pagoda style and is hence different from the other temples in Janakpur that generally bear resemblance to Mughal architecture. It houses a female statue, said to be of Yogamaya, which has the reputation of being one of the most beautiful images of female forms in Nepal. Other holy sites of interest include the Laxman Temple, Sankat Mochan Temple and Hanuman Temple.Kuri Village, Kalinchok Kuri village, a popular tourist destination around 150 km from Kathmandu, lies at an altitude of 3,842 metres above sea level in Kalinchowk of Dolakha district, in Bagmati province. People visit the place to enjoy the snow during the winter besides the mesmerising landscapes and splendid panoramic view of the Himalayan range. Kalinchok gets snow mainly at the end of December and the snowfall continues till the end of February or mid-March. When there is snow, it is difficult for jeeps, buses and cars to reach the top of Kuri village. Chains are wrapped around the wheels of vehicles and specially modified jeeps with highly experienced drivers are used to carry visitors. There are several hotels and restaurants in the area. The road up to Kuri has also improved over the years.Annapurna Base Camp Annapurna Base Camp trek, in Gandaki province, makes for a picturesque journey that takes you to the foothills of the Annapurna South, up to 4,130 metres above sea level. The five-day trek (seven days for slow walkers) offers rich cultural diversities, typical Nepali villages and the flora and fauna nestled at the foothills of Annapurna. The distance from Pokhara to Annapurna Base Camp is approximately 81 kilometres. It is among the shortest and most budget-friendly treks in Nepal. For Nepalis, lodging costs around $5 to $10 per day. For foreigners, the overall cost of the trek ranges from $800 to $1500 on average per person. Annapurna Base Camp trek can be done at any time throughout the year as each season offers a different trekking experience. The ideal time for the trek depends on your weather preferences and what you expect from it. However, autumn (September to October) and spring (March to May) are considered the two best seasons for the trek, as the days at the time are warm and bright with clear skies.Bardiya National Park Bardiya National Park, located in the southern Tarai belt of Lumbini province, is home to one of the most elusive and majestic animals on earth—the Royal Bengal Tiger. The park, which covers an area of 968 square kilometres, is considered one of the most important protected areas in the country. It is a prime destination for those looking to catch a glimpse of a tiger. A bit of luck and patience will offer a good chance to see the Bengal Tiger. The jungle safari also offers one the opportunity to spot Asian elephants and the greater one-horned rhinoceros. The rare Gangetic river dolphins are occasionally spotted on rafting trips along the Geruwa River, the eastern channel of the Karnali river. Besides, visitors can enjoy the homestays and explore local Tharu culture. The right time to visit the park is from mid-September to mid-December and mid-February to May.Khaptad National Park Khaptad National Park in Sudurpaschim province is a protected area in the far western region. It stretches over four districts of Bajhang, Bajura, Achham and Doti and ranges in elevation from 1,400 to 3,300 metres. The park can be visited throughout the year. Trekkers are advised to bring their tents, food and other supplies. The Nepal Tourism Board says of late, social media has been increasingly influencing Nepali travellers to go to Khaptad. Since the far-flung Khaptad National Park is still offbeat for many travellers, the area remains pristine and fresh. The seasons of spring (March-May) and autumn (October-November) are the ideal times to visit the park. The temperature ranges from 10°c to 20°c offering pleasant trekking weather. The monsoon begins in June and lasts until September and during this time, roads often become muddy and slippery. From December to February, winter brings snow and chilling winds to the park.Limi Valley \nOnce again, my heart swelled with joy when my hometown came into view.Arriving at Lalikharka after the treacherous journey through Pauwa Bhanjyang and the bustling Kanchhi Dokan, Phidim, the headquarters of Panchthar district, revealed itself like a surprise gift. My home town, Phidim, is unique in the fact that it reveals to travellers approaching it from uphill. As the vehicle descends the mountain road, it slowly comes into view, its houses and buildings recognisable for the native son.This Dashain, I undertook the much-awaited trip to my hometown with my wife Kabita and daughter Aarohi. Little did I anticipate the transformation that awaited me.The moment I got out of the jeep, I noticed that Phidim, nestled in the lush hills, has undergone a remarkable transformation over the years. As I guided my family to my home, which had suffered damages in the 1989 quake that struck eastern Nepal, I found that old, mud and stone houses had been replaced by concrete buildings. The place was vastly different from the one I remembered.Arriving at my childhood home felt like reuniting with an old friend. Navigating its nooks and crannies with my daughter, we delved into the history of the house, a symbol of my cherished memories.My wife had visited Phidim years ago, spending a month with my parents. She, too, recalled beautiful moments she had had in the town. I asked the tenant about the neighbours and acquaintances. Some had died, while others had left for good.A call to local journalist Giriraj Banskota led me to the school grounds, where memories flooded back. This was where I spent my teenage years, playing ball, learning to kick, and watching major tournaments. Here, I even encountered a group of Western climbers headed to Kanchenjunga, the world’s third-highest mountain. I remember being awed by their shiny yellow tents, headlights and strange smell. I remember practising my tutephuteko Angrezi with the climbers. Birendra Shield, an annual sports tournament named after the late king, brought ace players from various schools in Panchthar district. The district also hosted Yuba Mela, an annual three-day fair to commemorate the birthday of the king, organising football tournaments in which teams from as far as Sunsari and Taplejung participated. I never excelled at dribbling balls. A boy growing up in a seven-member family, I soon found my interest in literature. In the late 1980s, Phidim hosted a major literary festival. In the run-up to the 1990 pro-democracy protest, walls were painted with anti-monarchy slogans, local politicians were arrested. I took my family to my school, Naya Namuna Secondary School. It was Saturday, so the school was closed. I peeked through the steel gate and wall, imagining myself labouring over classes. Memories are hazy, but what I remember most is going out of the school—to quiz contests with me leading the school team, to essay competitions at the District Education Office and to play carom board, a national pastime, in a nearby shopfront. Returning to the main street, the demolition of a landmark gate made me reflect on how cities transform, shedding old landmarks for new identities. Navigating narrow alleyways, I felt like a stranger in my own hometown. Multistory buildings have emerged and roads have been paved, reshaping the town. It’s the same place with a different face, leaving me nostalgic for the Phidim of my memories.We finally reached Shivalaya temple, which I told my wife and daughter was one of my cherished hangouts. A giant statue of Falgunanda (the Kirant leader’s birthday is celebrated on November 10) stood before the steps to the temple. Though my wife suspected I came here to smoke, in reality, I visited the temple in the evening to meet friends and talk about issues that mattered most to us at the time. It also offered a panoramic view of the town (I could not take my family to Gadhi Danda, a hillock across the Shivalaya).Towards the end of my journey, I felt sad about Phidim’s lack of prospects. To my dismay, I found that people have been leaving the town in droves. Despite blacktopped roads and multi-story buildings, Phidim faces a troubling reality. The lack of quality higher education and specialist healthcare has driven people away, echoing the circumstances that led me to Kathmandu years ago. Conversations with locals confirmed a mass exodus from the town, a trend that raises concerns about Phidim's future.My conversations with familiar strangers led me to conclude that Phidim has transformed into a transit town for pilgrims heading to Pathibhara Devi Temple, which is around 255 kilometres north in Taplejung district. I met dozens of people headed to the holy site. While pilgrims see it as a stopover, for me, it was a homecoming. The realisation dawned that Phidim is, perhaps, in a state of transition, trading its rustic charm for the hallmarks of urbanisation. While I left Phidim for higher education in Kathmandu, people from rural areas have flocked to the town in search of better opportunities, bringing life and energy to the once quiet community.As we bid adieu to my hometown, I couldn’t help but reflect on the inevitability of leaving a place, no matter how enamoured one is with it. Passing Kanchhi Dokan, I pointed out Kanchnajungha and Kumbhakarna to my daughter—symbols of my childhood. Phidim, now a blend of nostalgia and change, remains etched in my heart, a testament to the intricate dance between memory and evolution. \nInter Milan escaped Etihad Stadium with a surprise 0-0 draw against Manchester City in the Champions League on Wednesday, exacting a small measure of revenge for their narrow loss to Pep Guardiola’s side in the 2023 final.Both teams squandered numerous chances in a breathless back-and-forth affair. City were largely stalled by Inter’s impressive discipline in defence, while Simone Inzaghi’s Inter, who were dangerous on the break on a nervy night for both sides, were wayward with their finishing.“We faced a really difficult team,” Guardiola said. “I’m still really, really satisfied for the game we played, especially with how (Inter) defended, they are masters of that, so big, they help each other unbelievably. So you cannot expect to create a lot of chances.”Inzaghi was similarly pleased with his squad’s night.“I said ‘well done guys’, they put in a giant performance,” the manager said. “I asked them to play exactly as they did. We all know Manchester City, what they are capable of, we knew we had to pull out all the stops, play a great game and we did it.”City’s goal machine Erling Haaland, who would have become the fastest player in history to record 100 goals for a European club had he scored, will have to wait to achieve that milestone.The Norwegian, who has nine goals in four Premier League games this season, narrowly missed a couple of first-half chances including a header that keeper Yann Sommer jumped up to grab on the line, and a hard, low shot that rolled just wide of the post.Henrikh Mkhitaryan had City fans breathing a huge sigh of relief when he missed a late chance, launching a rocket just over the bar from about eight metres out, then holding his head in disbelief.At the other end, Ilkay Gundogan elicited huge groans from City fans after twice failing to convert with close-range headers in the dying seconds. He launched the first one straight at the keeper, with the second one glancing just over the bar right before the final whistle.City fired 22 shots to Inter’s 13 but only had one more shot on target than their visitors with five.Under the new Champions League format, teams play eight matches against eight different opponents, with the top eight sides in the 36-team league automatically advancing to the last 16, and the next 16 playing a further knockout round.It was a lacklustre performance for four-time defending English champions City, who are in a familiar spot sitting atop the Premier League table after four games with a 100% record. Inter are third in the Serie A table.One negative on the night was a potential injury to City captain Kevin De Bruyne, who appeared to pick up a knock late in the first half and did not play in the second.His team face another intense contest on Sunday when they host Arsenal, who sit two points behind them in the table.City, who edged Inter 1-0 to hoist the 2023 Champions League trophy in Istanbul as part of their treble, were eliminated by eventual winners Real Madrid in the quarter-finals of Europe's top competition last season, while Atletico Madrid ousted Inter in the round of 16. \nNepal Police Club missed their chance to leapfrog Tribhuvan Army Club to the second spot in the ANFA Women’s League after they were held to a goalless stalemate by sixth-placed Chandrapur Municipality at the ANFA Complex in Lalitpur on Wednesday.Police also had to rely on a goalkeeping heroics from Usha Nath to avoid a shock loss late in the game as the goalkeeper saved a penalty kick from Dil Kumari Magar, helping the departmental side preserve their unbeaten run in the league.The draw—second in a row and third in the season—will still have damaging consequences to Police as the outcome left them four points adrift of leaders and reigning champions Armed Police Force Club, who are on 16 points.Police have 12 points from six games.Army occupy second position with 13 points.Police were not at their best and had to wait until the 34th minute to have a clean chance at goal when Niru Thapa outran two Chandrapur defenders to set up Nirmala Upadhyaya inside the penalty area but Chandrapur goalkeeper Usha Thapa reacted quickly to save Upadhyaya’s shot.Niru also set up Anuska Sherpa with a beautiful through pass in the final minute of the first half but Chandrapur goalkeeper Thapa came to the rescue again with her quick thinking.Chandrapur came close to scoring in the injury time of the first half after a poor defending from Samikshya Ghimire allowed Sunita Sunar from an open play but she ended up shooting wide.Police almost found the lead five minutes into the break when Niru’s strike beat Chandrapur’s goalie Usha, who had come far off the post to check Ghim Kumari Gurung’s clever pass, but the shot could not find the target.Chandrapur had a golden chance to punish misfiring Police in the 71st minute from the penalty kick. They were awarded the penalty after Ghimire handled the ball inside the area but Police goalkeeper Nath stretched full length to deny Magar and saved her side from the jaws of defeat.In the later action, Karnali Province registered their first victory of the season with a 3-0 victory against Sudurpaschim Province.Bhumika Budhathoki put Karnali in front in the 24th minute capitalising on an opportunity by Garima Rai, who twisted and turned to outwit Sudurpaschim defenders before putting it on the plate for Budhathoki.Rai then combined with Budhathoki to double Karnali’s lead in the 62nd minute, before Barsha Oli finished off a counter attack to wrap up a comfortable victory.Karnali stayed in the ninth position with four points. Sudurpaschim are rock bottom after facing their sixth defeat in six matches. Bagmati Youth Club play against Waling Municipality on Thursday. \nFormer Italy striker Salvatore Schillaci, a star of the 1990 World Cup on home soil, has died at the age of 59, his former clubs Inter Milan and Juventus said on Wednesday.Schillaci led Italy to their third-place finish in 1990, winning the Golden Boot for his six goals during the tournament, including in the semi-final against Argentina and in their third-place victory over England.“A football icon is leaving us, a man who has entered the hearts of Italians and sports fans around the world,” Italy’s prime minister Giorgia Meloni posted on X.“Salvatore Schillaci, known by everyone as Toto, the striker from the magic nights of Italia ‘90 with our national team. Thanks for the emotions you gave us, for having made us dream, celebrate, embrace, and wave our national flag. Bon voyage, champion.”The Sicilian’s wide eyes as he celebrated his goals became one of the enduring images of that World Cup and his was the name on all Italians’ lips, outshining more established players such as Gianluca Vialli and Roberto Baggio.Schillaci was awarded the Golden Ball as player of the tournament and was later named as the runner-up for the 1990 Ballon d’Or men’s player of the year award, behind World Cup winning captain Lothar Matthaus of West Germany.He had started Italy’s opening World Cup game as a substitute but came off the bench to score the winner in a 1-0 victory over Austria.After the excitement of 1990, Schillaci scored only one more goal for Italy and did not appear for them at any other major tournaments.A small, bustling striker, Schillaci, nicknamed “Toto”, had been a late developer, spending the early years of his career playing in the lower leagues for Sicilian club Messina.He was the top scorer in Serie B, the Italian second division, in 1988-89, earning him a move to Serie A giants Juventus.“We immediately fell in love with Toto. With his desire, his story, his passion,” Juventus said in a statement.“We at Juve were lucky enough to get excited about him before, in that incredible summer of 1990, the whole of Italy did.”Schillaci helped Juventus to claim the Coppa Italia and UEFA Cup in 1989-90 before winning the latter trophy again four years later with Inter Milan.Serie A President Lorenzo Casini paid tribute to Schillaci.“He was a champion who lit up the “magic nights” of Italia 90,” he said.“His desire to reach the top levels in soccer has been and will remain a source of inspiration for so many youngsters pursuing their dream of playing in Serie A.”He then became the first Italian player to play in Japan’s J.League and won the league title with his club Jubilo Iwata in 1997.He retired from football in 1999.The Italian Football Association’s (FIGC) president Gabriele Gravina said Schillaci was a symbol of will and redemption.“It is precisely this indomitable spirit that... will make him immortal,” he added. \nThe French Embassy in Nepal on Monday honoured Palesha Goverdhan, Nepal’s first Paralympic medallist.French Ambassador Virginie Corteval, Tanka Lal Ghising, member-secretary of the National Sports Council, and sports representatives and business leaders, among others, congratulated Goverdhan for her hard work and success.“Palesha, you are a beacon of hope and determination,” said Corteval. “Your journey reflects the audacity to dream and conquer challenges. You have revealed the immense talent of Nepali athletes to the world.”The event also served as an opportunity to introduce the Choose France/Marque France initiative, which encourages collaboration in business, culture and education between France and other countries, including Nepal, the embassy said.In alignment with the values of the Choose France/Marque France campaign, Goverdhan’s achievement reflects the spirit of perseverance, cooperation, and excellence that both nations strive to promote, the embassy said.As part of the Choose France initiative, the embassy announced Choose France Tour, scheduled for September 28 at the Alliance Française, where Nepali students will have the chance to learn more about studying in France and meet the representatives from more than 15 prestigious French educational institutions.Goverdhan made history on August 31, defeating Serbia’s Marija Micev 15-8 in the bronze medal match to become the first Nepali athlete to win a Paralympic medal. \nIn 2008 Matina Shakya was only three years old when she was appointed as the Kumari of Kathmandu. She was succeeded by Trishna Shakya as the new Kumari in 2017.Kumaris are revered as goddesses of beauty and strength in certain Hindu and Buddhist traditions. Worshipping young girls as Kumaris is a 2,000-year-old practice in Nepal. Since the 13th century, when the Malla kings ruled, the Newars of the Kathmandu Valley have been worshipping Kumari, a girl from the Shakya/Bajracharya community chosen to embody the divine energy of goddess Taleju Bhawani. The reign of a Kumari ends when she starts menstruating. So long as she is serving as the Kumari, she is believed to be the nation’s divine protector, safeguarding it from evil. Matina, 18, is now in her first year of college, studying for a bachelor’s degree in management. Her father, Pratapman Shakya, when asked about having a daughter who is the only living the goddess in the world said, “Not having your own daughter live in the same house as you seemed a little unfair, but we feel very proud to call ourselves the parents of the royal Kumari who is revered by people all over the world.”On March 9, 2023, he, along with Matina, were getting ready for a special function held to honour all former Kumaris from across Nepal. “There are often events to honour Matina as she was the royal Kumari, but this one was dedicated to all former Kumaris from different areas. There are 129 living Kumaris in all,” he added. Besides Kathmandu, Kumari tradition is followed in Bhaktapur, Lalitpur, and Kirtipur, among other cities.According to him, this was the first time an event like this was organised and the Deputy Mayor of Kathmandu, Sunita Dangol, was also in attendance.Throughout the year, many people line up outside the ‘Kumari Ghar’ to get a chance to visit the Kumari and get her blessings. Many foreigners stand out in the yard to catch a glimpse of her. Nepali people believe that if a Kumari smiles at you, it is a bad omen.Everyday, a tutor visits the Kumari to help her continue with her education as she is not allowed to step outside the Kumari Ghar. She takes her exams and does her homework from the Kumari Ghar itself. She also has the freedom to play inside the Kumari Ghar. Many former kumaris have pursued careers in their fields of interest or studied after their term ends, and they continue to be treated with the same respect. The tradition of Kumari has evolved over time. In the past Kumaris did not enjoy these freedoms.Because of various superstitious beliefs, Kumaris were not fully educated and were forbidden from getting married because of the belief that the groom would die soon if he married an ex-Kumari. They led secluded lives, were restricted from participating in normal childhood activities, and focused solely on their religious duties.However, now, these myths have been dispelled. Modern understanding has shifted to recognise that Kumaris, after stepping down from their divine role, have the freedom to marry and lead a normal life. The perception of Kumaris as isolated figures has evolved, with a focus on providing them with a more balanced upbringing. There have been initiatives to integrate Kumaris into regular social and educational settings, allowing them to have a more holistic and fulfilling childhood experience. “Matina was already familiar with the students from the school that she attended after her term as Kumari ended,” said Shakya. “The kids visited the Kumari Ghar frequently so that she could have a smooth transition,” he added. According to Gautam Prasad Shakya, who has been living as a caretaker in the Kumari Ghar, the changes made to the tradition are minor. “The traditions of Kumari have mostly stayed the same. All the rituals are still practised like in the old days,” he said.On 6 May 2005, Pun Devi Maharjan, a lawyer, filed a case in the Supreme Court claiming that the traditional practice of electing young girls as Kumaris, or “goddesses’, who are expected to follow certain social restrictions and appear at religious festivals, violated the rights of the child. Quoting Maharjan’s complaint, Puskar Mathema writes in Yuwamanch Monthly of October 2007, “If Kumari tradition is continued, it will undermine the fundamental rights as well the freedoms of children guaranteed by the constitution and child rights treaties. Apart from this, it will have a negative impact on their physical and mental development.”The case continued while Nepal overthrew the monarchy and declared itself a secular state in 2007. When the judgement was pronounced in 2008, the goddess was still in her role, now giving blessings to the country’s President. The court ordered that the Kumaris and ex-Kumaris receive better benefits and arrangements and ordered the government to improve their support and allowances.In April 2006, Prof Chunda Bajracharya filed a petition at the Supreme Court against Maharjan’s petition, who had argued against the Kumari tradition. Bajracharya contended that the tradition should be preserved as heritage due to its over 100 years of history.“People who don’t understand the culture shouldn’t comment on it,” she stated. Bajracharya also criticised the human right activists who contended that Kumaris were only allowed to wear the colour red. “People who say Kumaris are forced to wear red clothing all the time, are the same people who send their kids to schools in uniform,” she said.“After the 2008 court verdict, there have been a lot of improvements. Now, a teacher visits the Kumari Ghar daily to tutor the Kumari, who is expected to complete school assignments and sit periodic exams. All the former Kumaris now get benefits like scholarships and special pensions,” she added.Bajracharya is currently a professor of literature at the Tribhuvan University in Kathmandu.“The only significant change that the court verdict brought to the tradition was in terms of her education,” said Gautam Prasad Shakya, the caretaker. “Kumaris were tutored long before the case, but the case helped formalise this arrangement. After the court verdict, the time between 12 pm and 4 pm was designated as the Kumari’s tuition time,” he added.After the verdict, there was a concerted effort to provide Kumaris with access to quality education, enabling them to develop the skills and knowledge needed to lead fulfilling lives beyond their divine roles. There was also a shift towards ensuring that the Kumari's living quarters are comfortable, safe, and conducive to her overall well-being.Moreover, the selection process for the Kumari underwent reforms in the aftermath of the Pun Devi Maharjan case. There was a push for greater transparency, accountability, and inclusivity in the selection of the Kumari, with an emphasis on ensuring that the process was fair, respectful, and free from undue influence.Efforts were made to support their transition into adulthood, including providing them with comprehensive resources for education, vocation, and social integration. This shift aimed to address the challenges faced by former Kumaris and empower them to lead independent and fulfilling lives after their divine service.“The Kumari tradition has evolved over time. During the tenure of my daughter, we saw a lot of improvements. Even after her time as Kumari, Matina continued to get a lot of government support,” said Shakya, former Kumari Matina’s father.“Some people argue that child rights are being violated, but all of her rights are being upheld inside the Kumari Ghar. This is a unique and respected aspect of Nepali culture, and I don’t believe it violates any of my child’s rights.”While the Kumari tradition continues, its practices have evolved. “She enjoys this normal life and it didn’t take her long to adjust as well,” says Matina’s father, on her transition from the revered Kumari to the ordinary Matina. \nWhat animals did Juddha Shumsher have in his zoo?“We only have records of animals from the mid-1960s,” says Ganesh Koirala, who has been employed at the Central Zoo for the past 36 years and currently serves as its information officer and programme officer. “That too I hand-copied from an old torn-down file that I came across.”Today, the Central Zoo, which sprawls across six hectares in Jawalakhel, Lalitpur, houses as many as 1,298 wild animals of different species of mammals, reptiles, fishes and birds from Nepal and around the world—from tiger, rhinoceros, hippopotamus and red panda to its recent attraction: a pair of chimpanzees.After enduring decades of neglect under various government bodies, with its animals and infrastructure scraping along in a deplorable state, the zoo received a new lease of life with improved infrastructure and animal care in 1995, when it came under the management of the King Mahendra Trust for Nature Conservation (KMTNC), now known as the National Trust for Nature Conservation, in 1995.Today, the Central Zoo is an entertainment venue, one of the most happening places in the Kathmandu valley. Flocked by thousands of daily visitors, the zoo now also hosts rescued animals and those in need of rehabilitation. It is also a site for conservation education.But when Juddha Shumsher Rana (prime minister from 1932–1945) built the Jawalakhel Zoological Garden on the premises of his Jawalakhel Durbar (where Nepal Administrative Staff College stands today) in 1932, he did so purely for private interests—as a space of entertainment and amusement for him and his family.Built in the semi-wilderness of Jawalakhel around a historical pond dating to the 17th century during the reign of King Siddhi Narsingh Malla, the zoo also became the space he could use to show his respect for two women he revered, his mother and sister-in-law, and indulge in one of his favourite pastimes—gambling.Today, the Central Zoo, nestled in the heart of Jawalakhel's sprawling crowd, does not go unnoticed, and its story is well told. But what passions drove Juddha to build the zoo? What was its original layout? What animals did it have in the beginning? And how did Juddha spend time there?“I remember once seeing a small board that read ‘Jawalakhel Zoological Garden’,” Koirala says. “I don’t know whether it was from Juddha’s time or was made in the later years. It must surely be that Juddha built the zoo out of influence from the British given how this term was used by them.”Koirala adds, “There is a former employee, now an elderly gentleman who worked in the zoo in the 1960s. He surely has some stories from Juddha’s time.”Birds, beasts and palacesTo trace the birth of Jawalakhel Zoological Garden, one has to look at the history of Nepal’s rulers owning birds and animals.Like rulers around the world, Nepal’s royalty kept wild and exotic birds and animals in captivity as a source of pleasure and mark of wealth and power. The book ‘Social History of Nepal’ by historians TR Vaidya, Tri Ratna Manandhar and Shankar Lal Joshi details how Mallas during the mediaeval Kathmandu Valley to Ranas and Shahs in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries owned rare, exotic creatures. In 1708, a rhinoceros in Kathmandu Valley broke the iron chain in which it was bound and killed its tamer. In 1714, Bhaktapur’s King Bhupatindra Malla gifted a camel and an elephant to Kantipur’s King Bhaskar Malla to build peace.Among Shahs, King Rana Bahadur Shah in particular was reputed for his collection of birds and animals. He also owned a zoo outside his palace in Basantapur Durbar Square, where the Nepal Bank Limited stands in New Road today. The zoo contained “tiger, bear, monkey, elephant, horse, deer… heron, peacock… pigeon, wild dogs, rabbits, rats, mongoose.”Jung Bahadur Rana’s zoo on the premises of his Thapathali Durbar hosted a variety of birds and animals collected during his hunting expeditions as well as those brought from abroad. Jung Bahadur himself used to “supervise and inspect it”. Juddha Shumsher likewise had his own collection of creatures which steadily expanded into a zoological garden. Seeking wilderness in his Jawalakhel DurbarJuddha’s biographer Ishwari Prasad writes in ‘The Life and Times of Maharaja Juddha Shumsher Jung Bahadur Rana’ that between 1933 and 1940, Juddha shot 433 tigers, 33 rhinoceros and 93 leopards. An insatiable big-game hunter, Juddha had a deep fondness for being in the wild and among wild animals, and from this came, according to oral history prevalent among members of Kathmandu’s Rana community including Juddha’s descendants, the desire to own a zoo.Built in 1752, Schönbrunn Zoo in Vienna, the world’s first modern zoo, was already over 100 years old when Juddha was born in 1875. London Zoo opened in 1828 and Alipore Zoological Garden (Kolkata Zoo) in 1875. Nawab Wajid Ali Shah Zoological Garden (Lucknow Zoo) was established in 1921. Juddha’s inspiration, his descendants say, was most likely reinforced by his tours to zoological gardens during his visits to England in 1908 and to different Indian cities.An article titled ‘Central zoo in state of neglect’ published in The Kathmandu Post in 1996 says that Juddha one day “received a pair of leopards as a gift”, cementing his desire to own a zoo. A report ‘Central Zoo Master Plan’ prepared by the KMTNC in 1996 says that Juddha decided to build a zoo in an epiphany when he saw that some animals “including deer, a few rhinos, and some tigers had been collected from the Tarai and kept in Kathmandu” could be put into one compound in the “lonely piece of land with a large 16th [sic] century Malla period Pokhari”.The pond lay still and serene surrounded by green wilderness ever since Patan’s King Siddhi Narsingh Malla built it in the 1600s. On the grounds surrounding this pond, the Newars from Na:Tole, Pulchowk and surroundings had their devisthans where, for centuries, they gathered to perform their religious ceremonies during Basanta Panchami and Bhoto Jatra even after this area fell within the Jawalakhel Durbar.For the palace, the ground served as its extended garden along with a horse and elephant stable. Subodh Rana, 69, grandson of Juddha Shumsher, recalled his father Kiran Shumsher telling him that Juddha and his family sometimes also used the scenic grounds for picnics. If there was any spot where Juddha wanted to build a menagerie, it would be around this Pokhari (pond). One day, he called his grandson General Maheshwar Shumsher Rana and deputed him to the task of doing just this.The zoo’s layout—except for the small plots of lands acquired later—that was in place when it came under KMTNC's management was, the present and retired zoo officials believe, mostly the same as it was built by Maheshwar and so offers a peek into how Juddha’s zoo must have been like. Pond in the middle of the ground surrounded by enclosures—the southern bank housing mainly larger animals, and cages for birds positioned on the northern banks.From pigeons to the king of the jungleWhat animals and birds did the enclosures at Juddha’s zoo house?“We cannot tell for sure,” Koirala says.Once it came under government ownership, the zoo was tossed from one institution to the other for lack of interest and knowledge on the right institution to manage it. Amid all this chaos, documents were possibly lost and the zoo has no concrete record about the animals that Juddha must have once taken amusement at, said Koirala.Mukti Narayan Shrestha, 82, a retired secretary of the Nepal government, joined the Central Zoo in 1970 as a veterinarian when many original structures of the zoo were still intact. Shrestha also worked with an elderly khardar who, he says, was employed in the zoo since the time of Juddha and was about to retire when he joined.“In those days where the purpose of menageries was exclusively for exhibition and pleasure with no regard for the welfare and recreation of animals and birds, the cages were tiny and iron-barred,” Shrestha says.Elephant, horses, deer, monkeys, tiger, rhinoceros, clouded leopard, red panda, bear, palm civet (nir biralo), four-horned antelope, Himalayan goral, pheasants, Himalayan monal—from the mythical and the majestic, the gentle and friendly to the fiery and ferocious, Juddha’s zoo boasted them all, Shrestha says.Shrestha’s account is not different from the anecdotes passed down to other retired and present zoo officials and the members of the Rana community, who also detail the rare and the exotic fauna, like the gharial crocodile and porcupine, even the jungle’s king—creatures, they say, that Juddha must have received from foreigners as gifts—appearing alongside domestic birds like pigeons.Tidbits of published information also confirm that the zoo had a good collection of exotic birds and animals from Nepal and abroad. One such suggestion comes from Kalyan Shumsher’s ‘Shree Teen Juddha Mahima’ published during Juddha’s reign in 1943.“One need not travel abroad to see the incredible birds and animals found in foreign countries,” he writes. “It will suffice to see [those creatures] right here in the zoo opened by His Holiness Shree 3 [Juddha] in Jawalakhel.”Among these incredible creatures, one reigned supreme—lion, the king of the jungle.For one, it would not have satiated Juddha to build a zoo and not have the jungle’s king exhibited in it. Juddha hence must have done everything possible to ensure one for the zoo. Infrastructure at the zoo suggests that the lion indeed lived at Juddha’s zoo or, in the least, during the Rana regime.“Where bear habitat lies today, there were two dome-shaped attached enclosures with a holding room, constructed in the classic architecture that many enclosures in the British zoos had in the past. They had brick walls and lime plaster,” Koirala says. “These were built to house a lion in one cage and a tiger in the other.”Near these enclosures stood another cage that remains intact today, with the head of a roaring lion carved out of the wall on the top of its iron bars. Zoo officials as well as members of the Rana community believe that Juddha had this exhibit built to specifically house a lion.Remarkably, these Juddha-era infrastructural spaces are corroborated by a rare piece of photographic evidence. A 1946 photo of the zoo shows a lion while a Kathmandu mother and her sons stand in front of its cage.Juddha’s place of piety and playThe zoo was not merely a space that Juddha sought out for amusement and retreat in the outpost of his palace; he also used this place to express his deepest affection.This affection spills right at the zoo’s entrance, in the form of the life-size statue of Karma Kumari Devi, wife of Juddha’s elder brother and Rana Prime Minister Dev Shumsher. Karma Kumari stands tall in her regal costume shaded by a wide canopy. Juddha revered Karma Kumari because it was she who raised him and looked after his mother Juhar Kumari Devi after the death of his father Dhir Shumsher. On another prominent part of the zoo on the south-east, Juhar Kumari’s enthroned statue overlooks the pond. Juddha had commissioned the London-based sculptor Domenico Antonio Tonelli to cast these statues.When Karma Kumari’s statue was unveiled is not clear, but Juhar Kumari’s statue was unveiled by Juddha amid a grand function in 1935 on Jawalakhel’s most auspicious day, Bhoto Jatra. It was attended by the British Resident Frederick Bailey.“On June 28, 1935, at Jawalakhel Durbar… the pond nearby looked very scenic,” says a Gorkhapatra news report titled ‘Statue installation’ dated July 5, 1935. “Because it was the day of Bhoto Jatra of Machhindranath… and moreover since an ideal woman’s statue was being unveiled, there was a crowd of lakhs of people.”Less than fifty metres from Karma Kumari’s statue stands a one-story building with a pagoda roof that today serves as the zoo’s meeting hall. Juddha, an avid gambler, found the scenic semi-wilderness covered in trees and filled with the sounds of wildlife to be a perfect place to relish the game. So he built a building with twelve doors on its four sides allowing him and his fellow gambling compatriots the freedom to enter through a particular door that they thought would bring luck. He called it his Juwa Ghar, the gambling house, and built it with the sole purpose of indulging in the game he loved. Roar of lion reverberates in KathmanduThe sounds of the animals and birds in the zoo rose up in the Jawalakhel sky. Every day, until much later in the 1970s, roar of the zoo’s lion (there were later other lions) diffused to far corners of the Valley, merging the zoo with the spirit of Kathmandu and informing the city folks of its presence.But was the zoo open to the public as well?“I think once it was built, the zoo was open for the public,” Subodh Rana said. “It is unlikely that Juddha Shumsher built such a large zoo and kept it only for his family.”For one, Kalyan Shumsher mentioning that one “need not travel abroad to see the incredible birds and animals found in foreign countries” suggests that the public had at least some access to the zoo. Of course, the Newar community from Na:Tole, Pulchowk and surrounding areas were permitted inside the zoo on the days of their guthi functions on Basanta Panchami and Bhoto Jatra.As the zoo was established at the back of the ground where Bhoto Jatra celebrations happen, it naturally filled with revellers on this day in addition to the guthi ritual observers as testified by the Gorkhapatra report. The photo of the mother and her sons also bear testimony that the zoo was not entirely closed to the public.What is widely believed, though, is that the zoo officially came under government ownership after Nepal became a democracy in 1951. And it would still be a few more years before it was open to the public in 1956.In 1945, Juddha gave up his power and eventually retired in Dehradun, India, where he died in 1952. With time, Jawalakhel Zoological Garden became the Central Zoo. It would take many avatars—a neglected site of crammed, unmaintained cages with sad eyes of emaciated creatures staring from behind the bars, a focal point of animal diplomacy, particularly during the period of monarchy, to, in its recent decades, a space of conservation and education.When all this was happening, the city sprawled around Jawalakhel, subduing the lion’s roar with its noise. More wildlife from around the country and the world came—creatures captured from the wild, those sold by circuses, those rescued from traffickers. Fate would bring these creatures to the care of generations of Kathmandu folks, intertwining each other’s joys and sorrows. After the tale of Juddha’s Jawalakhel Zoological Garden, there would be these stories to tell. Sitting around a table inside Juddha’s Juwa Ghar, Koirala and other zoo officials begin unfolding these stories before me. \nNepal’s book market is no stranger to the popular Bangladeshi-Swedish writer Taslima Nasrin. Almost all of her books have been translated into Nepali, but Nasrin herself says that they are all unauthorised translations. “All books [Nepali translations] are pirated versions,” Nasrin told the Post in a Whatsapp conversation. Nasrin, who is currently in exile in India after facing death threats in Bangladesh following the publication of her novel Lajja (Shame), said that she or her publishers have never allowed anyone the right to translate her books into Nepali. “I don’t know of any such Nepali publishers. No one asked for permission and no one has paid [me] royalty.”Translating and publishing books without permission from authors or publishers is a punishable crime. But Nepal’s book market is full of such unauthorised translations and prints of books written by the who’s who of the world literature. Such endeavours haven’t just hurt the authors but also the readers, says Ajit Baral, publisher of the Kathmandu-based Fineprint publication. “These translations are poor,” Baral says. “Tomes with 1200–1300 pages have been trimmed to 200–300 pages. An example is the biography of Bill Clinton.”Another popular book that has seen unauthorised Nepali translation is the biography of Steve Jobs by Walter Isaacson.“We have no official deal in place for a [Nepali] translation of Steve Jobs,” Peppa Mignone, associate agent of the CAA, the translation authority of the biography, said in an email interview with the Post.The book’s Nepali translation is published by Panchpokhari Publication House. The translated book identifies the translator thus: “Achyut Koirala, who has a master’s in English literature, is primarily a journalist. He is currently affiliated with Nagarik daily. He keeps a close tab on international history, politics and culture and has written scripts and dialogues for half a dozen Nepali films. He has published over a dozen non-fiction books.”Koirala, who admits to the unauthorised translation, claims that he hasn’t just translated the book but has also done ‘creative writing’ with it.‘Rich Dad Poor Dad’, written by Robert Kiyosaki and Sharon Lechter, is among the books that’s perennially on the bestseller list across the world. Upon investigation, the Post found three Nepali translations of the book—all unauthorised. One of them is translated by Dilip Kumar Shrestha and published by the same firm, the Panchpokhari Publication House. Another Nepali iteration of the book is published by Book For All publication and translated by Kopila MD. Yet another Nepali version is translated by one Sudheer Dixit and published by Plata Publication, Kathmandu.In an email conversation with the Post, Ronson Taylor, who oversees the international rights at The Rich Dad Company, said, “At this point in time, we do not have a relationship with an established publisher in the [Nepali] language market. If there are any Rich Dad Poor Dad books currently for sale in the Nepali market, they are pirated.”Basanta Thapa, a writer and translator, says that many books are being translated of late to make easy money. “But how would the quality of these unauthorised translations be!” Thapa wonders. “Readers who haven’t read the original wouldn’t know the faults in the translated versions.” Thapa says that any translator worth his salt aims to ‘recreate’ a book and it takes much work to do that.Taslima’s books are the major victimsTaslima’s memoir Uttal Hawa has been translated into Nepali as ‘Sangharsha’, literally Struggle, and is published by Khoji Publication House. Even though the book in its cover claims that it is an authorised translation from the English version Wild Wind, it is a pirated one. The book is translated by Bikash Basnet and edited by Bhogiraj Chamling. A revised version of the book is edited by Sangeet Srota (Yam Bahadur Chhetri).The same publication house has also published the Nepali translation of the book’s sequel as ‘Prem ra Jeevan’. Publisher Sushil Chalise says that while he is aware that one needs to receive permission from the author or the publisher to translate a book, his efforts to contact Taslima were unsuccessful. Therefore, he had published the version the translator made available to him. Translator Basnet, too, admits he translated the book without Taslima’s permission. “About a decade back, we didn’t know how to ask for permission,” he said.Nepal has the Copyright Act (2002) in place. Before it, there was the The Patent, Design and Trade Mark Act, 2022 (1965) that included intellectual property in its 2006 revision. Even the Muluki Ain (Civil Code) of 1910 BS had a provision about copyright. Moreover, it goes without saying that translating somebody else’s work without permission is immoral.Likewise, Indigo Ink Pvt Ltd has published a Nepali translation of Taslima’s anthology of essays No Country for Women as ‘Aaimai ko Kunai Desh Chhaina’. The book is translated by Krishna Giri and edited by Pramod Pradhan. “I have no idea about the agreement between the publisher and translator,” Pradhan, who is also a children’s book writer, says. “I just copy-edited it upon request.”Bishnukumar Poudel, publisher of Indigo Ink, however, claims that he is still trying to take translation rights for the book. “We translated the book long ago,” he says. “We are still trying to get translation rights.”Indigo is also publishing unauthorised translations under its imprints All Book Store Pvt Ltd, Book for All and Plata Publication. It has published two versions of Rich Dad Poor Dad under those shadow imprints. But Plata Publication is not registered in the Company Registrar’s Office.Pradhan says that many foreign books have had unauthorised translations in Nepali and their quality is poor. Those books are translated not from the original language but from a second or third language, so these translations are bound to have problems, he says. “After I learned that those were unauthorised translations, I have stopped editing them,” Pradhan said.Indian author Shiv Khera’s You Can Win has been translated into Nepali by Bloomsbury India and has granted the distribution rights to Ekta Books. But the book’s unauthorised translations are also found in the market and they don’t even mention the name of the publisher and translator. What is interesting is they mention that it’d be illegal to republish the book, or an excerpt of it, without the author’s permission.The Nepali translation of the book, which was poorly written and rife with inaccuracies, had landed the publisher at court. After a complaint was filed at the District Court Kathmandu in 2066BS on the charge that the publisher violated the copyrights and economic rights, the court had issued a verdict on Mangsir 11 that year, charging a fine of Rs10,000, Rs20,000 and Rs30,000 to the defendants Netra Prasad Pokharel, Narayan Prasad Bhusal, and Bhagwati Risal and Bishnu Silwal, respectively.Baral, the Fineprint publisher, says that international publishers wouldn’t demand much for translation rights given Nepal’s small market, but Nepali publishers do not bother to reach out to them. “Publishers who put out unauthorised translations and sell them at 50 percent discount have troubled publishers like us,” he said.Fineprint has published authorised translated versions of books such as Leaving Microsoft to Change the World by John Wood, Healed by Manisha Koirala, and Hippie by Paulo Coelho. The publication house is also set to release the Nepali translation of Israeli historian Yuval Noah Harari’s bestseller Sapiens. Translated into Nepali by Dinesh Kafle, the book’s translation right was acquired at the cost of USD1300, Baral said. Likewise, the publication acquired the translation rights of Sadhguru’s Inner Engineering at IRS93,000, he added.Baral says that publication of unauthorised translations is an immoral and illegal work. “This phenomenon not just hampers Nepal’s fledgling book publishing industry but also tarnishes the country’s reputation in the global market,” Baral said.Thapa, the writer and translator, points out the lack of regulatory mechanisms in the country. “We don’t have an agency that regulates the quality of translations being done,” he says. “Nobody compares the translation with the original. We need a dedicated authority to enhance the quality of translation.” Universities, Nepal Academy and other stakeholders can play a role to uplift the translation sector, he adds.One’s pain, another’s pleasureWhen the author Suketu Mehta was travelling through Mumbai, a young man approached him with a handful of books while his vehicle was stuck in traffic. Brandishing Maximum City, written by none other than Mehta himself, the young man requested the author to buy a copy. Suketu leafed through the book and said, “This is a pirated copy and I’m the author of this book.” The youth wasn’t bothered and replied, “Okay, you can buy it at a discount.”This anecdote was shared to the Post by Mehta’s friend, the author and professor Amitava Kumar, in an email exchange.Most of these pirated books are imported into Nepal from India while the retailers of original books are finding themselves increasingly in trouble. “We sell original copies but many readers doubt us as well, given the ubiquity of pirated versions,” says Anjan Shrestha, operator of Education Book House, Jamal.Ramchandra Timothy, chair of Thapathali-based Ekta Books Pvt Ltd, said that the phenomenon of piracy has tarnished Nepal’s image internationally. “There was a time when Bangladesh would be known as ‘piracy king’,” he said. “Now there's a risk Nepal would take the crown.”As tax increases, so does piracyThe government decision to impose a 10 percent tax on book imports in fiscal year 2019-20 led to a proliferation of pirated book markets, booksellers say. After the decision, booksellers started to cut back on imports and that led to the entry of a new crop of pirated booksellers, a trader in Kathmandu says. But following widespread backlash, then finance minister Bishnu Paudel struck down the policy.“After the government’s decision, we stopped importing books for a while,” says Shrestha of Education Books. “The import of books went down for about two years. Then the pirates stepped in to fill the gap. It was about that time that pirated copies of biographies and memoirs of Obamas and Jai Shettys became omnipresent in the market.”Pirated copies of classics by Roald Dahl and JK Rowling also made an entry in the Nepali market. Then the phenomenon only saw a rise.Since the customs department does not levy duty on foreign books and also does not care to differentiate between the pirated and original copies, unauthorised books have found a safe haven in Nepali market.The government doesn’t levy any customs duty on books and newspapers published by foreign publishers abroad. The importers should only pay Rs565 at the customs points. But Nepali publishers have to pay 10 percent tax to import books printed in India.James Taylor, director of Communications and Freedom to Publish of the International Publishers Association, says that the government, publishers, writers and readers should join hands to control widespread piracy. “The government should realise that book publishing and reading culture contribute to the country’s economy as well,” he said, adding that the government should seize pirated books and close websites that sell pirated ebooks.Nandan Jha, executive vice chair of Penguin Random House India’s sales, production and business department, says that piracy has emerged as a big challenge for publishers of late and has harmed the authors, publishers, distributors, printers, readers and other stakeholders. “To confront piracy, all the stakeholders should launch a special joint effort,” Jha told the Post in an email exchange.Piracy has proliferated in the Nepali market to such an extent that the publishers of such books and unauthorised translations keep whatever ISBN numbers they like, often conflicting with other books, and still get off scot free. If scanned or searched on the internet, the ISBN number gives details on the author of the book, what the book is about, and its price, among others.Bijay Sharma, information officer at TU Library, says, “Keeping ISBN number at one’s will is illegal. If anyone files a complaint, we can punish them.”By the lawThe Muluki Ain-1910 BS had mandated that a publisher take permission of Gorkha Bhasa Prakashini Samiti before publishing any material. The Copyrights Act came into effect in 2022 BS and was amended in 2054 BS. In 2059 BS, a new Act was promulgated and it is still effective now. Authorities are currently working to amend the Act to give the registrar’s office more autonomy regarding copyright.According to the 2059 BS Act, copyright violations are considered government cases. In such cases, plaintiffs should file a complaint with the police. The Act’s clause 25 has various conditions that amount to violation of copyright. The Act’s subclause A says that if a publisher produces or copies material in writing or sound and sells or distributes it, it amounts to violation of copyright.Likewise, the Act’s clause 26 prevents selling of unauthorised material. The clause restricts the ‘importation of copies of work or sound recording, either made in a foreign country or sourced otherwise, into Nepal for business purpose shall not be permitted if preparation of such copies would be considered illegal if they were prepared in Nepal.’If anyone infringes upon protected rights, they are liable to punishment but the provision’s implementation remains lax.The law gives the authority to district court to take legal action against copyright violators.Advocate Parshuram Koirala says that if the government becomes more proactive, it can punish violators on the basis of the 2059 BS Act and thereby control the phenomenon of intellectual theft and copyright violations. “Creation is a crucial part of humanity’s benefit,” he says. “If intellectual property is not protected effectively, then there’d be no inspiration to create something.”Bal Bahadur Mukhiya, a professor at Nepal Law Campus, suggests the inclusion of rules about digital piracy in law, and also the clauses of various related international treaties and agreements that Nepal is part of.“In the US, a teacher or professor should pay a certain revenue even to photocopy a chapter of some text for teaching purposes,” Mukhiya says. “But in Nepal, those who photocopy an entire book and sell it go scot free.”(This report is prepared in collaboration with the Centre for Investigative Journalism, Nepal.) \nIn the past two weeks, the Federalism and Localisation Centre organised interactive programmes with chief ministers, ministers, political party leaders, principal secretaries and secretaries, and other key officials from Koshi, Madhesh, Bagmati and Gandaki provinces. Today, the Centre is organising a similar programme in Lumbini Province. This article summarises the key insights shared by the chief ministers during these discussions, focusing on three key areas: Provincial government achievements, challenges in federalism, and necessary reforms, including issues related to constitutional amendments.During a session in Pokhara, Chief Minister Surendra Raj Pandey stressed that the federal governance system cannot be effectively institutionalised without a significant shift in the mindset of political leaders. He recounted how he coordinated with then-Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal to convene a meeting of the National Coordination Council in July 2023, but lamented that the meeting yielded no meaningful outcomes. Although the meeting made six decisions to clarify the rights of all three tiers of government, Chief Minister Pandey pointed out that none have been fully implemented.According to him, while former Prime Minister Dahal was genuinely committed to federalism, many other leaders did not share the same dedication. Despite Dahal's commitment, the momentum for federalism stagnated during his tenure, as attempts were made to centralise power instead of promoting federalism. Pandey argued that it is unproductive to blame bureaucrats for the stagnation of federalism; rather, the real issue lies in a lack of political will. He mentioned that although the Madheshi and Maoist parties initially drove the federalism movement, political parties must now clearly articulate their stance if constitutional amendments are needed.Pandey asserted that provinces are the most crucial innovation of federalism, though opposition has emerged due to internal provincial issues and resource allocation. He stated, \"If we fail to deliver services, we must reassess our approach. Criticising us without the chance to perform is unfair. The federal government often does not pass necessary laws, yet we are held accountable.\" Engaging with nearly 100,000 people annually, he highlighted that this is a direct result of federalism. He called for a shift in political attitudes and expressed concern about provincial employees and police not being under provincial control, limiting governance potential.Chief Minister Hikmat Bahadur Karki of Koshi Province shared similar sentiments about the state of federalism in Nepal. He highlighted a concerning trend: Political leaders who once served at the provincial level often forget the challenges provinces face when transitioning to the federal government. \"Many who were once in the provinces during their first term are now at the federal level, but they seem to have forgotten the struggles and concerns of the provinces,\" Karki noted. He also addressed alarming calls to abolish federalism and eliminate provinces, attributing such views to a centralised mindset.Karki urged those drafting the constitution to take responsibility for its implementation, emphasising the need to prioritise federalism and constitutional reinforcement. He dismissed claims that integrating civil servants and police into the provincial system is impossible, warning that undermining federalism could lead to renewed conflict. \"If federalism is abolished, a new constitution may emerge, but it will only push Nepal towards further turmoil,\" Karki cautioned. Instead of dismantling the current federal structure, he advocated for addressing its flaws, noting that provinces operate with limited authority that must be expanded.Karki questioned the need for 25 federal ministries, suggesting that only essential ones like the Prime Minister’s Office, Finance, Defense, Home Affairs and Foreign Affairs should remain at the federal level. He criticised the disparity in resource allocation, noting that 80 percent of government employees are at the federal level, while the combined budgets of all seven provinces fall short of a single federal ministry's budget. To address this, he proposed a revenue-sharing model, with the federal government receiving 30 percent of revenue and provinces and local governments each receiving 35 percent. Karki expressed dissatisfaction with the Fiscal Commission's performance, stating it has not followed the constitutional spirit. He also highlighted the challenges of administrative federalism, where many civil servants resist transfers. Despite these issues, Karki acknowledged progress in infrastructure development but lamented the lack of communication and advocacy for federalism. In Madhesh Province, there is a growing recognition that meaningful federalism can only be realised if the federal government allows provinces to exercise the rights guaranteed by the constitution. Concerns have been raised about the federal government's reluctance to grant constitutional rights to provincial governments under various pretexts, hindering the institutionalisation of federalism.During a dialogue on strengthening federalism held in Janakpur, Chief Minister Satish Kumar Singh highlighted positive developments in sectors such as education, health and infrastructure since the establishment of federalism. He cited these advancements as having significantly transformed the rural landscape of Madhesh, underscoring the tangible benefits of provincial governance.Despite limited rights and resources, Singh highlighted the provincial government’s commitment to establishing essential infrastructure and mechanisms for the benefit of the people. He noted that the effective roles played by provincial and local governments during the Covid-19 pandemic were crucial in saving countless lives. Singh cautioned that relying solely on the federal government during such crises would have led to dire consequences, further reinforcing the importance and relevance of federalism.While acknowledging that the rights granted to provinces are insufficient, Singh said that the provincial government has shown its presence by undertaking necessary tasks even in areas beyond its jurisdiction. For instance, despite lacking authority over basic education, the provincial government has initiated school infrastructure development. He highlighted the critical issue of the teacher-student ratio in Madhesh Province, where one teacher serves 40 to 45 students, compared to the standard of one for every 20 to 22 in the hills, raising concerns about education quality.Singh noted that 80 percent of government employees are concentrated in Singha Durbar, fostering a perception that provincial workers are penalised. He criticised the federal government's maintenance of 25 ministries, arguing that only five to seven are necessary, especially with existing provincial ministries. Singh stressed the importance of addressing flawed practices while advocating for provincial rights. He warned that if actions undermine the future of federalism, Madhesh Province would not remain silent. Calling for unity among political parties against attempts to weaken federalism, he emphasised that collaborative efforts are essential for strengthening governance in Nepal.Chief Minister Bahadur Singh Lama of Bagmati Province expressed serious concerns about the ongoing challenges the provincial government faces, particularly due to the lack of control over police administration. He underscored that a government without effective police oversight is fundamentally flawed. \"While a government may exist, its significance diminishes without a functional police administration,\" he stated.The relationship between the federal and provincial governments has been strained for some time, especially regarding police integration and civil service legislation. In light of these challenges, Bagmati Province has proactively constructed police facilities and established relevant laws. However, unresolved issues surrounding police integration continue to hinder effective governance. He acknowledged that while some changes have occurred since the implementation of federalism, they do not align with citizens' expectations. \"The hopes and desires of the people are substantial; however, managing these aspirations with current resources presents significant challenges,\" he explained. Chief Minister Lama assured attendees that the provincial government is prioritising issues outlined in the list of exclusive rights mandated by the constitution, stating, \"To date, we have enacted 80 laws that address the needs of our province.\"Lama emphasised the urgent need for improved coordination among provincial, federal, and local governments, identifying this as a primary challenge. \"Developing the necessary laws to facilitate effective collaboration among the three tiers of government is essential. Failure to do so will lead to public dissatisfaction.\"The insights shared by the chief ministers highlight the urgent need for reforms in Nepal's federal system. While progress has been made, significant challenges remain. \nFollowing remarkable development gains, Nepal stands at a crossroads in its journey towards inclusive, green growth and sustainable development. It must chart a path through multiple, linked challenges. Health, economic, climate and social fragility, alongside rapidly changing opportunities, demand that it adapts. But the future is unpredictable. Making Nepal's development choices requires frank, inclusive and challenging conversations. It requires local knowledge and collective experience. Decisions must be based on the best available evidence and, where necessary, challenge the status quo. As Nepal’s oldest partner—with over two centuries of shared history—the United Kingdom remains committed to this journey. Together, we are exploring how to navigate future development challenges. In that spirit, we’re launching a series of expert discussions—the “Horizons Dialogue Series”—to provide an inclusive space for dynamic conversations on Nepal’s development pathway, drawing on Nepali and international expertise. Nepal’s development journey is complex. Space for forward-thinking and innovative solutions, grounded in credible data and local insights is vital. Testing assumptions and examining the many faces of fragility matter. These dialogues offer an opportunity for those committed to transformational change in Nepal to come together in a conversation informed by evidence. To delve into Nepal’s future economy, demographics, migration, climate, and nature. The first dialogue, Navigating Nepal’s Fragility, will focus on how health, economic, and climate challenges interact. Overlapping shocks lie at the heart of Nepal's ability to anticipate and respond to crises. Drawing on local voices and expert insights, this shared approach will consider what might happen in the next five to ten years. It will help examine the inequalities that leave some groups more vulnerable than others. For many women, lower-income families, and marginalised groups, health crises, economic downturns, and environmental disasters have a more devastating impact. This reality makes tackling the intersection of vulnerabilities essential to greater resilience. External shocks that compound one another present risks to Nepal’s economy. Remittances and tourism have long been critical to the country's economic landscape. But their volatility during crises exposes vulnerability. Exploring how Nepal can foster an economy that is more sustainable and better prepared for future disruptions matters. As does considering how governance structures, social protection systems and local initiatives can leverage inclusive growth. For many Nepalis, especially those in rural and marginalised communities, access to resources, healthcare, and job opportunities remains unequal. Addressing these disparities will create an economy that benefits everyone. Air pollution—a growing concern—is closely tied to the climate-health nexus. It disproportionately affects vulnerable populations. Twelve percent of Kathmandu’s population suffers from chronic health conditions linked to the rising pollution levels from industrial emissions, reliance on biomass and dated transport infrastructure. While economic and health challenges may be better known, climate change is a looming backdrop to Nepal’s development choices. Shifting weather patterns, melting glaciers, and environmental degradation affect the economy, food and nutrition, water security, increasing pressure on vulnerable populations. For rural farmers, these disruptions can mean the difference between survival and destitution. The risks posed by glacial lake floods, such as those recently witnessed in Thame and Mustang, highlight the immediate threats to life in the Himalayas. The United Nations Secretary-General’s visit to Everest underscored Nepal’s vulnerability, with his message from the \"roof of the world\" calling for urgent global action on climate change. As Nepal grapples with these challenges, climate resilience must be at the core of any long-term development strategy. The Horizons dialogues will also explore how nature conservation, sustainable land use and biodiversity protection can be integrated into Nepal’s broader development goals. Safeguarding the country’s rich natural resources will ensure both economic, social and ecological stability. At the heart of these discussions is the need for strong, adaptable institutions capable of managing contemporary social and economic challenges across the country. Transparent, accountable governance will ensure resources are used efficiently and development efforts are inclusive. Nepal’s institutions must be able to respond to immediate crises while remaining flexible enough to address longer-term shifts. The dialogues will reflect on how Nepal’s governance structures can be resilient and drive development outcomes that are shared equitably. Migration and demographic changes will be the focus of the next dialogue. Migration, both internal and international, is driving rapid economic and social change in Nepal. Demographic shifts, including youth migration from rural to urban areas and overseas, is reshaping labour markets and infrastructure needs. Understanding these trends will be crucial to chart Nepal’s development journey over the next decade. Nepal’s ability to adapt, respond to crises and achieve sustainable growth requires agility and recognition of local realities. Reflecting this, in February 2024, the UK launched a refreshed development portfolio in Nepal. This new portfolio recognises the interconnected nature of Nepal’s challenges and opportunities. It includes support for climate adaptation, anticipatory action on disasters and efforts to protect the most vulnerable while ensuring access to health, education and other basic social services. We’ll also help local governments build climate-resilient infrastructure based on local needs and work to promote investment, good jobs, and clean growth. Nepal’s development journey in a rapidly changing world is filled with both opportunities and uncertainties. Working with Nepal’s leaders, experts and local voices, the UK hopes the Horizons Dialogues will help create space for critical reflection between Nepal and its friends. It will help us—together—consider innovative solutions that respond to Nepal’s future needs. It will bring together diverse perspectives on the future, blending the expertise of Nepali policymakers and development experts, with partners such as the UK’s Durham University and international collaborators, integrating the lived experiences of Nepal’s communities. As these conversations unfold, they will help chart a path forward—one grounded in local realities, informed by credible data, and focused on creating a resilient and equitable future for all.  \nIn the run-up to Constitution Day (Asoj 3), the government is preparing to partially open the historic Dharahara Tower to the public. Major parties are planning their own events to mark the special day. At the same time, tension is growing as those opposed to the 2015 Constitution of the Federal Democratic Republic of Nepal secretly plan to create a disturbance on the streets of the capital city.Some activists are openly preaching their intention to eventually turn Nepal into another Bangladesh and drive party rulers out of the country like Sheikh Hasina. Of course, this dream is impossible and not in the national interest. Yet the government anticipates a significant confrontation with the protestors that day—probably comprising Madheshi groups, monarchists like the Rastriya Prajatantra Party and anti-corruption activists. I advise restraint from the perspective of Dalits, Janajatis and other marginalised groups. We must indeed come out in large numbers and demonstrate to demand appropriate statute reforms and vent our anger at the authorities for ignoring our major causes. But we should peacefully protest to not aid and abet monarchists and others who want to reverse this constitution's great achievements. We cannot afford to lose some of the constitution's gems, such as republicanism, secularism, proportional representation, inclusion, human rights, press freedom and the rights and privileges accorded to historically oppressed castes and communities. Our demand should be to get more rights and to force the state to implement those provisions. Do we want the monarchy back?The simple answer is no. Republicanism is one of the significant sources of contention against this constitution among some people, but it’s almost impossible to resurrect the Hindu monarchy in today’s Nepal. The call for restoring the deposed King may appear increasingly louder in the media, also because many of the proponents of this idea belong to the high-caste elite groups. The ground realities, however, paint a different picture. A look into the country’s demography alone is sufficient to understand why the monarch's return is impossible today. Understandably, few Dalits, ethnic nationalities, Madheshis, Muslims, Christian converts, etc., support the monarchy. The majority of this population has suffered a great deal under the dictatorship of the Hindu king through the centuries. One shouldn’t be confused by a few individuals like Rajendra Lingden, who leads a highly conservative Hindu monarchist party, the RPP. Some people are frustrated with growing immorality, dishonesty, corruption and poor delivery of the party leadership and may assume that the monarchy was better. Why not have just one king with the crown rather than several kings sans the crown? But history suggests otherwise.Monarchy is responsible for Nepal's status as one of the poorest nations. Kings didn’t develop Nepal as much as they could have, not least in the second half of the 20th century, when many nations, mainly those in East Asia, became tremendously rich and powerful. The Shah kings did nothing substantial to promote the rights and identities of the marginalised communities. Instead, they persistently dominated them. All they did was strengthen the Hindu caste hierarchy, greatly impeding national progress and development, as anthropologist Dor Bahadur Bista famously argued in Fatalism and Development. It’s thus important to understand that republicanism is not the real issue here; Brahmanism is the mother of our current ills. After the termination of the Hindu monarchy, the power and influence of the second-tier Chhetri and Thakuri, too, have eroded rapidly. Forget about distributing power to the lower ranks. Hill Brahmins or Bahuns have virtually monopolised all state sectors, including political power and juridical and military authority. Indeed, they are always in charge of the religious realm. Constitutional reformWe must focus not on dismantling the 2015 constitution, returning it to its 1990 form by reviving monarchy as monarchists have demanded—but on reforming it to reflect current realities. There must be ways to ensure, for example, that leaders cannot exploit the provisions of Article 76 to frequently change governments. We must ensure that no individual, family, clan, caste or community can monopolise power for as long as is happening now. Solid constitutional provisions should also be made to ensure that political parties operate more democratically and transparently and that party leaders are held accountable for their actions. Importantly, changes should reduce financial and other forms of corruption and/or misuse of authority at the highest level.One way to do so would be to find ways to prevent the use of large sums of money to contest elections. When officials are forced to invest massive amounts simply to get elected, they will naturally be forced to use every possible means to return that money. This is a significant driver of widespread corruption and other power misuse. The fully proportional electoral system is often touted as the best way out of the vortex of corruption. Still, more careful considerations are required to find the most suitable way forward. Likewise, critical constitutional reforms are required to protect and promote the rights and privileges of the many disgruntled groups nationwide. There’s a severe need to make all organs of the state sensitive to the suffering of Dalits and other suppressed communities.Promoting Dalit freedom Party leaders have cheated Dalits by declaring Nepal a state free from untouchability and making provisions to safeguard their rights and uplift them socially and economically but not enforcing the constitutional and legal requirements. They spend significant amounts to make villages free from open-air toilets. Not a penny has been spent to realise the dream of a society free from caste discrimination, however.High-caste politicians have effectively copied King Mahendra's strategy. The latter made constitutional changes in 2020 BS to apparently end caste discrimination, but they permitted and preserved it by stating that religious and cultural beliefs and practices should be respected. I’d urge the Nepali Government and Parliament to add a provision in the constitution to amend religious and cultural beliefs and traditions to eradicate caste discrimination. Much of the caste-based humiliation, hatred and violence emanates from Manusmriti, Parasarsmiriti and Garud Purana and many other Hindu texts. Traditional shamanic and tantric traditions, too, are laden with systems of caste exclusion and separation.  \nIt is no secret that we are taking in chemicals-laced fruits and vegetables into our kitchens and bodies. But the Nepali government reports progress, suggesting most of the food we consume might be safe. Last year, the Department of Food Technology and Quality Control tested over 63,000 samples and found only 37 of them positive for pesticides. A similar report from the Central Agriculture Laboratory indicated that 8,503 of 8,575 samples tested for carbamate and organophosphate pesticide residues were safe for consumption.These reports are far from comforting, as they include tests only for a limited number of pesticides. In reality, pesticide imports have more than doubled in the past five years in Nepal, from 169,360 kilograms in 2017-18 to 354,358 kilograms in 2022-23. According to Kantipur, a sister publication of this paper, nine kinds of pesticides are registered in Nepal. Among them, seven kinds are imported. While hundreds of pesticides fall under these groups, only two—residues of insecticide from the carbamate and organophosphate—are tested in the government’s laboratory. The rest are left untested and unregulated. Such negligence from the authorities and from farmers who knowingly or unknowingly use insecticides and pesticides has endangered people’s lives. Heavy use of pesticides leads to severe health problems. The living examples of this are the residents of Gorkha Gandaki Rural Municipality in Gandaki Province. Sixty-one people in the place are fighting cancer, and 15 more are suffering from kidney failure. People in other districts are also struggling with the immediate health effects of pesticides (dizziness, tiredness, heart attack, vomiting, headache, among others) as well as long-term effects (cancer, retarded body growth, inborn disability, etc.). The state cannot shun its responsibility to protect the lives of its citizens; the right to health is their fundamental right, too. There have been measures like declaring Karnali as an “organic province” six years ago. Yet, chemical fertilisers banned, farmers in the province were given no alternatives like organic compost and plant fertilisers to grow enough healthy crops and vegetables. Nor were there laboratories and manpower to test if the foods being produced were really organic. As yields dwindled, people became even more dependent on chemical-laden foods imported from India. The organic project, which could have been a model for the country, was instead a dismal failure. If the use of pesticides continues, a nationwide public health crisis is not far off. The examination of foods for the heck of it must stop. If the authorities really want to work in favour of consumers, they must test for a wider range of pesticides in the food imported via the open border. There must also be more labs to test these products in local units. As important is allocating more technicians for this work, which even our few laboratories lack. All these measures seem a little too much to ask but they are all worth pursuing in the long run. At stake are the health and wellbeing of millions of Nepali. Experts also highlight the lack of knowledge and awareness among farmers about the use of pesticides—and local levels can play a key role in making them aware of their downsides. The more we educate them, the better we control the use of chemicals. \nFormer Deputy Prime Minister and Home Minister and current chair of the Rastriya Swatantra Party Rabi Lamichhane has desperately tried to evade responsibility for his role in the misappropriation of cooperatives funds. Yet the mounting pile of evidence suggests his clear culpability. The parliamentary special probe committee was specifically formed to look into his involvement in the siphoning of money from various cooperatives into the Gorkha Media Network, of which he was the Managing Director. If the feelers coming from the committee members are any sign, Lamichhane will be held accountable for his crime. Yet corruption in Nepal is not limited to Lamichhane or his party. If Lamichhane deserves to be investigated and, if found guilty, punished, so should members of any other political party, irrespective of the positions they occupy. Credible evidence has emerged of the involvement of Dhan Raj Gurung, the Nepali Congress Vice-president, in the embezzlement of funds from a Lalitpur-based cooperative. Gurung reportedly helped his ex-wife, Joyti Gurung, embezzle around Rs12.5 million. Similarly, there are accusations that Risikesh Pokharel, the CPN-UML leader who is also the chair of Parliament’s Public Accounts Committee also helped his wife, Anjala Koirala, embezzle as much as Rs120 million from a Morang-based cooperative. What is interesting about the cases against the senior Congress and the UML leaders is the state’s apparent collusion in shielding the two. For instance, the operators of Miteri Savings and Loan Cooperative had filed complaints against 11 people, including Gurung, for misappropriating funds. But the Bagmati Province government has excluded his name in the list of the possible culprits it has sent to the Central Bureau of Investigation of Nepal Police. (The province has Bahadur Singh Lama of the Congress as its chief minister.) Likewise, the Cooperative Registrar Office of the Koshi Province has excluded the name of Anjala Koirala in the list it has forwarded to the police. This is even though the victims of the cooperative had flagged her as one of the operators involved in fund embezzlement. (Koshi province has Hikmat Kumar Karki of the UML as its chief minister.) How seemingly the whole state apparatus is being employed to shield the political leaders from the two ruling parties is shocking. No wonder the government is facing allegations of bias and vindictiveness. On Saturday, Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli spent much time fulminating against the Maoist Centre, new political forces, the royalists of various hues as well as Kathmandu's mayor. Yet there was little in terms of introspection. How does he expect people to take either him or his government seriously when it is seen as protecting the corrupt and the compromised people? Rather than making big promises, Oli and his government would be better served if they are seen to be fairly applying the rule of the land and working in public interest. The cooperatives crisis is assuming alarming proportions. It has the potential to do serious damage to the national economy—besides adding untold miseries to hundreds of thousands of poor cooperatives victims who stand to lose everything if prompt measures are not taken to bring fraudulent cooperatives operators to book. If the Oli government plays with the cooperatives’ fire, it could find itself engulfed in the inferno.  \nChild drowning has become a common occurrence in Nepal’s Madhesh Province. We are only a few months into this fiscal year, and 49 people, 39 of them children, have needlessly lost their lives in ponds, fish ponds and rain-filled pits. These incidents, unfortunately, are likely to escalate this year as the number of deaths by drowning has steadily inched up in the past few years. The figure, which was 81 in FY 2022-23, rose to 124 in FY 2023-24. This necessitates immediate preventive measures from households and governments.But what is more alarming is that these preventable deaths are not a priority for government officials. A recent Post report highlights this glaring negligence, as deaths by drowning haven’t been included in disaster preparedness programmes in any of the 136 local units of the province. Instead of addressing the issue head-on, they are busy passing the blame and pointing to the parents’ supposed negligence for failing to attend to their children. This has, in turn, added to the woes of the bereaved families.The World Health Organization has listed many ways to prevent drowning, including covering wells and fencing swimming pools. It also recommends providing childcare for pre-school children and teaching school-age children basic swimming. Conducting safe rescue skills training with safety measures is another requirement. However, these preventive measures are rare in Nepal’s local units. In Chhinnamasta Rural Municipality in Spatari, authorities rely on a simple awareness campaign to mitigate the risks of drowning—a crucial but insufficient measure when it comes to saving lives.Countries around the world, despite witnessing deaths through drowning, only recognised World Drowning Prevention Day in 2021. Nepal followed suit in 2023. With late recognition of this problem, devising plans, policies and programmes to prevent drowning incidents are in a nascent stage, and many local units are largely unequipped. However, recognition alone is not enough; authorities should at least be mindful of the goings-on in their localities. The first order of business should thus be for local authorities to include this life-threatening incident in disaster preparedness projects, focus on fencing ponds and pools, initiate programmes to cover wells and to mandate construction workers to cover construction pits. Concomitantly, practical measures like training locals to rescue and monitor the pond/water source areas are vital. Likewise, parents and children should be educated in households about the dangers of drowning; school-going children need to be taught about water safety through school curriculum. Children under five drown even in bucket water, quickly and silently and, therefore, deserve special attention. Every child has the right to protection from harm.The provincial and federal governments must heed this problem and launch mass awareness campaigns. Of all child mortality under five, drowning accounts for 2.8 percent deaths in Nepal. The WHO’s preventive measures to upskill people in rescue activities and train school-age children could be beneficial in mitigating the risk, but these programmes need big financial commitments and human resources. Federal and provincial governments can help local governments by coordinating with international aid agencies. It is incumbent on local representatives to work on this problem wholeheartedly rather than merely brushing off the issue by blaming others. Everyone should work together to put a lid on it. \nNepal is marking its ninth Constitution Day on Thursday. The country’s two largest parties—the Nepali Congress and the CPN-UML—formed a coalition government a month ago with a commitment to reviewing and amending the constitution. In this context, Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal and Binod Ghimire sat down with constitutional expert Purna Man Shakya to discuss the good and bad aspects of the constitution amendment process.The Congress and the UML have floated a proposal to amend the constitution. Is the time ripe to make changes in our statute?Generally, constitutions are reviewed after around a decade of their implementation. So, we have come to the stage of reviewing whether our constitution has functioned properly. However, the sudden announcement of the amendment is premature, as this is a serious business. In our case, the constitution can’t be amended just based on the interest of one or two parties. It requires a national consensus. There should be an understanding among the political parties represented in Parliament. And, a sort of consensus even among the people’s level is important as there was huge public involvement in making this constitution. Sentiment of various communities must be respected while making any changes in the national charter. What can be the modality of seeking consensus at the people’s level? Should a draft be prepared and opened up for debate?While making changes in the constitution, some issues might be technical and not of interest to common people. But if any changes are made in policy issues that can alter our country’s structural dynamics, the concerned communities must be consulted. Just the present strength of the political parties represented in Parliament is no guarantee that they truly represent people. For instance, the Maoists emerged as the largest party through the election in 2008. But it has been shrunk to a distant third in the House. However, we can’t conclude from this that the people have discarded the party’s agenda. The Maoists might have been discredited due to their activities and failure in delivery but people might still favour the agenda they once championed. Similar is the case with other parties. Therefore, we have to consider broader consensus both in Parliament as well as the people’s level.How challenging is it to enter the constitution amendment process?Any amendment calls for a two-thirds majority in the House of Representatives as well as the National Assembly in the federal parliament. If an issue is linked to provincial authority, it should be endorsed by the majority [four] of seven provinces. So, this is not easy. Therefore, the parties should tread carefully.You mentioned earlier that constitution amendments without a review process is not a right step. Could you elaborate?The right way is to first have broad understanding among the top leaders of political forces on the issues and then constitute a panel of experts to conduct a comprehensive study on that. Such studies are conducted through two methods—doctrinal and non-doctrinal. The doctrinal method analyses related literature and principles on theoretical approach while the non-doctrinal method studies the public sentiments and opinions through surveys and interactions, and comes up with certain methodologies with the help of subject experts. Through such study, the experts identify the issues and recommend the ways to the politicians. This is the right process.There are also arguments that reviewing the constitution without even bringing it into full-fledged implementation is wrong. Based on the practice during these years, we have concluded that certain provisions didn’t work properly. It is true that we are talking about making changes in the constitution without even implementing certain provisions. First we have to give the system an opportunity to work in a full-fledged way. Then, we can evaluate whether it worked. Any move to dissolve the system without properly implementing it will create divisions and invite another conflict. A question that is often asked: Is there a problem with our constitution or with our politicians? People can change the constitution but the constitution can’t change the people. Therefore, a constitution should be developed also on the basis of the nature of people in the country who use it. If our political parties and the politicians had reformed themselves, we might not have had to discuss constitutional changes time and again. We should have made the system strong for more effective checks and balances and made leaders and officials more accountable. The ruling parties reason that the constitution amendment became necessary to ensure political stability.When a federal government is changed, its aftershocks are immediately seen in all seven provincial governments. It directly impacts development and other activities across the country. It’s a flaw in our party system but we have to find a solution in the system. We see people raising voices for two things—stability and retirement of old politicians. As Nepali politicians never retire voluntarily, we have to address it through the system. Direct election of executive head can be one way to address this problem. People have found local governments more effective than federal and provincial governments. It is because chiefs and representatives of local governments are directly elected and they can serve the full five-year term.Once people are given the right to elect heads of government, they won’t elect old faces such as KP Oli, Sher Bahadur Deuba and Prachanda [Pushpa Kamal Dahal], who have been tested multiple times. It will serve two purposes—first, it gives stability and second, it allows popular leaders to emerge in place of the old ones. The old leaders have maintained control over national politics through their huge party organisations. But when people directly elect presidents and chief ministers their grip over party organisations can’t be decisive in national politics. For that we have to amend the constitution.However, again, an expert team needs to thoroughly study the pros and cons of such changes. But what I can say based on the general study of public perception is that we can first go for direct election of executive heads at the provincial level. In the next phase we can go for direct presidential election at the federal level.What went wrong in the practice of the three-tier federal system?While adopting federalism, the basic idea was to allow the local governments to oversee local matters while the provincial governments would handle wide ranges of issues related to agriculture, industry, forest, education and health, etcetera. If the two sub-national governments handle these things, people don’t need to come to the centre seeking solutions to their problems. In such a scenario, the federal government can focus on important affairs such as foreign relations, defence, telecommunication, currency, national infrastructure projects and inter-provincial affairs. Such division of powers would automatically create specialisation in the respective governments.But the federal system is not implemented as per that spirit. Provinces aren’t allowed to exercise their rights. People are still travelling to Kathmandu all the way from remote districts even for basic things. The constitution has mandated the provinces to maintain law and order in their respective provinces but the federal government hasn’t allowed them to have their own police forces. Provinces without police have become like administrative units. The centre has a huge bureaucracy in Kathmandu. It is high time that the centre delegates authority to provinces as per the constitutional spirit. Federal lawmakers have huge interest in local development activities because it is directly related to their election. They don’t want to lose this influence. The interest of federal lawmakers however contradicts with the constitution.There is also a belief that the local level has authority in areas where they can’t work effectively, for instance they are mandated to oversee the education system up to grade 12 while provinces don’t have much role. Do you think such jurisdictional matters need to be reviewed and provinces should be given more authority?That’s right. First of all, we should be clear that there is no point in adopting a federal system if we don’t want provinces because we had central and local levels even in the past. Provincial layer is an integral part of federalism. So, we have to think about transferring certain rights from local to provincial level because the local units don’t have expertise to oversee education up to grade 12 on their own. Our local units are traditionally trained in local development activities. But now they are entrusted with the responsibility of not only overseeing education and health issues but also with legislative and judicial functions. They haven’t been able to play that role. We should think about transferring some roles from local to provincial levels. Likewise, the centre should be ready to allow the provinces to exercise their rights bestowed by the constitution. It is time to strengthen the provinces.You said direct election of executive heads in provinces could end instability at the provincial level. But what if a popular leader got elected chief minister but other political parties won majority seats in the provincial assemblies? In such a situation, the rival parties may not help the chief minister pass a budget or policies from the assembly.Yes, there are strengths and weaknesses of all systems. Such problems can be resolved because we see similar situations in other countries as well. Parties can’t prolong the deadlock in the House because they will be blamed for the impasse. One basis is that our local units are doing well under executive heads. So, we can practise it for a decade in the provinces and then apply it to the federal level based on that experience.Many forces and groups that aren’t happy with the present constitution, which was basically a compromise document. Once the constitution amendment process is open, they are certain to revive their demands. Will the situation be manageable?If the rights of historically marginalised communities are curtailed, they will certainly retaliate. If you try to go against the federal republic system and policy of inclusion, it may invite new conflicts. The proportional representation system is not a problem. Leaders made it unpopular by misusing it. We should find solutions to stop its misuse. We shouldn’t forget that this constitution is not only a constitution but also a key document of our peace process. This is not perfect but it was essential to end the conflict. Many say that while making a document of compromise, our constitution hasn’t followed the principles of constitutionalism. For instance, the hearing system is something unusual in a parliamentary system. As a constitutional expert, do you think we should also think about fixing such deviations?You are right. When we couldn’t change the people, we tried to add additional features as a measure to check the wrongdoings. Our leaders make appointments in key constitutional bodies guided by their personal and partisan interests. We copied the hearing practice from the presidential system with a view to check the leaders’ arbitrary appointments. It hasn’t been that effective. Therefore, we have proposed to give continuity to the hearing for political appointments but not in the appointments of judges because lawmakers don’t have the expertise to examine judges’ competence. Since lawmakers are mainly guided by the party’s whip and top leaders’ instructions, it rather increases political interference even in the judiciary. We have thus proposed to stop the hearing process for judges’ appointments.Many say that the judiciary hasn’t been federalized even though all other sectors have been restructured as per the three-tier federal system. Why this exception for the judiciary?Oh, you dragged me to a sensitive topic. One thing we shouldn’t forget is that we adopted a federal system not to unify small countries. We were already a united country. We adopted it to better manage our social diversity by involving all the communities in the governing system. We at the same time have to safeguard the country from disintegration. Judiciary, the national army and Nepali language are our institutional arrangements that can play a unifying role. Therefore, we didn’t make much changes in these three aspects.Some instances show that Nepal’s federalism might have been a bit more effective had the judiciary worked proactively. For instance, the court hasn’t decided even the cases filed by provinces years ago. What do you think about the judiciary’s role in this connection?Yes, those cases are still undecided. In the Constituent Assembly, the Maoist party had registered a proposal to form a separate constitutional court. The justices who were leading the judiciary at the time opposed the idea. It was later rejected. Then the idea to have a separate constitutional bench was included as a compromise deal. But it has failed to work effectively. It failed to decide election-related disputes. We have to review its jurisdiction. They have decided certain cases when there is public pressure. For instance they decided cases like House dissolution because there was constant public scrutiny. But they haven’t shown any interest in other important cases where constitutional interpretation is needed. Of late, a strong opinion is being built in favour of forming a separate constitutional court. These issues are being discussed seriously. This issue may emerge if the constitution amendment process begins.What we can infer from your analysis is that the constitution amendment process is not that easy. What are the basic things that should be and can be done in the constitution amendment at this stage?First, we should change the form of governance at the provincial level and go for a directly elected executive head. With this there will be no change in government in provinces after changes at the centre. The governments in provinces can work for five years with certainty. Second, we can transfer the powers that the local units have failed to exercise to provinces. And, the centre should allow the provinces to exercise the concurrent rights. By doing this the centre can reduce the overwhelming burden on it. While the provinces can play an implementing role, the federation can play a supervisory role. These things need to be fixed. We need some amendments to the constitution and some new laws for this. \nNepal has often earned global recognition for its progressive policies and inclusive stance on LGBTQIA+ rights. But do the global accolades Nepal has earned in terms of its progressiveness reflect the actual experiences of queer people here? The Post’s Aarati Ray sat down with Manisha Dhakal, executive director of the Blue Diamond Society and a leading advocate for LGBTQIA+ rights in South Asia for over 23 years.Nepal is often hailed for its progressive stance on queer rights, both in South Asia and globally. With over two decades of queer rights advocacy, how accurate do you find this portrayal?Many activists and commentators do describe Nepal as being progressive on queer rights. While this is partly true, especially when we consider the legal frameworks, the reality at the grassroots is quite different. On the one hand, Nepal’s constitution recognises LGBTQIA+ identities. Articles 12 and 18 mandate that “gender identity” be acknowledged on citizenship certificates, while Article 42 promises affirmative action and participation in government for sexual and gender minorities. Court decisions in Nepal, too, have been favourable for LGBTQIA+ rights, and unlike many former British colonies with Section 377-type laws that criminalise queer communities, Nepal has no such legal barriers. So, indeed, there are opportunities for activism, and progress has been made, particularly in terms of legal recognition. But, again, the rights enshrined in the constitution and affirmed by the courts have not been realised at the grassroots level. We are stuck with a limited focus, primarily on citizenship. The state claims that we’ve been given the right to identity and legal recognition, but even this is not fully realised. For example, the process of obtaining citizenship based on self-identification remains difficult, with government officials still unclear on how to implement these provisions. The broader narrative of Nepal being progressive is built on a superficial understanding of the situation.In August, Nepal’s Supreme Court ruled that Rukshana Kapali, a transgender woman, should be legally recognised as a woman on all documents without medical verification. How does this decision impact the future of LGBTQIA+ rights in Nepal?Rukshana’s case is a prominent victory, highlighting the judiciary’s support for LGBTQIA+ rights, especially compared to those of the executive and legislative branches. This ruling lays a strong foundation for similar future cases and will undoubtedly help in future activism. However, it’s important to note that the decision applies only to Kapali, meaning others will still need to go through the courts to have their gender identity legally recognised. How long must transgender individuals continue to endure lengthy court processes just to obtain citizenship?Even outside the courts, the bureaucratic hurdles—from medical reassignment surgeries to invasive checkups and long delays from the CDO (District Administration Office) to the Ministry of Home Affairs—can take years, with no guarantee of getting preferred names on legal documents. In many cases, even after completing the process, the names are inaccurately changed, such as altering Ram to Rama instead of the preferred name, like Manisha.We [Blue Diamond Society] get 15-20 complaints each year, primarily from transgender women, regarding difficulties in obtaining citizenship.The Supreme Court’s recent decision on same-sex marriage in Nepal has attracted global attention and gotten a positive response. Are there any limits to the court’s decision?After a long and arduous process, we secured temporary registration for same-sex marriages. On June 28, 2023, the Supreme Court, in the Pinky Gurung vs. Government of Nepal case, issued an interim order instructing the government to temporarily register same-sex marriages, including for those with “other” gender markers. That said, the Civil Code adopted in 2017 still defines marriage as a union between a ‘man’ and a ‘woman’.We, as a community, are pleased with the government’s temporary registration process. Yet it falls short of offering full marriage rights, including those related to property, adoption, and tax exemptions. While the court’s decision sets a supportive precedent, lack of clarity about the rights associated with the temporary certificate leaves many in limbo. So far, only around five couples have registered, and many in the community are hesitant to do so.The question remains: Can this temporary registration truly grant us the same recognition as heterosexual marriages? While the decision has garnered global praise, the LGBTQIA+ community on the ground continues to feel cheated of true equality. Our ultimate goal is to amend the Civil Code so that marriage is defined as a union between two individuals, rather than being restricted to one between male and female.Why do many court decisions on queer rights in Nepal, like of same-sex marriages, remain in limbo? Is this due to the government and courts trying to appease both conservative and progressive groups, or is it just a performative gesture of inclusivity?There are multiple factors at play. I think some responsibility also falls on activists. For example, when fighting for legal recognition since 2008, we should have advocated not only for the “third gender” or “other” but also for individuals who have transitioned from male to female or female to male. What’s more, policymakers and bureaucrats still lack awareness about human rights principles related to minority groups like the LGBTQIA+ community. Even though Nepal has ratified international conventions on human rights, these commitments have not been prioritised by lawmakers, which leads to this state of limbo and half-hearted inclusivity.As for the internal thought processes of bureaucrats and lawmakers, it’s hard to say. Many of them might still believe that the LGBTQIA+ community shouldn’t be granted full rights, so they engage in performative actions—appearing supportive on the surface to attract global attention but hesitating to fully advance our rights. This could explain why progress seems to stall midway.Queer rights have received some legal recognition. But how are they reflected in terms of social and cultural acceptance in Nepal?Legal changes and social acceptance need to go hand in hand. If we only focus on legal reforms without addressing societal attitudes, there will be no real change. We’ve seen this play out—there is legal recognition of gender identity, and temporary registration for same-sex marriage is available. Yet people struggle to fully realise these rights because of deep-rooted discrimination within families and society.In Nepal, a socially and culturally driven society, where family, relatives, and festivals play a major role, social acceptance is often more important than legal acceptance. When it comes to cultural acceptance, biases still persist. For example, it feels like we’re allowed to express ourselves openly only during the Pride Month in June. When we try to participate in other celebrations like Teej or Gaijatra, society often reacts negatively, asking why we need to “spoil” their festivals. This shows that social change is still lagging, despite the progress in legal rights.You mentioned that the queer community is often given the surface level of legal recognition. How is the state of the exercise of fundamental rights for LGBTQIA+ people in Nepal?Labelled as ‘gender and sexual minorities’, our broader struggles are ignored. When we raise concerns about poverty, food insecurity, or unemployment, the response we often get from government institutions and stakeholders is, “This isn’t our issue; it’s a gender problem.”We are just as much a part of society as anyone else. Issues like climate change, housing, and poverty affect us too. We want to be included in solutions, whether it’s participating in climate programs or being involved in community initiatives. Unfortunately, lawmakers and stakeholders often overlook that we are just as human as heterosexuals, with needs that go beyond legal recognition on paper.What are some aspects of the queer community that have not received enough attention in media narratives, and what tends to be unnecessarily highlighted?As I’ve mentioned before, the narrative surrounding our community often focuses heavily on issues like citizenship, while overlooking other important aspects of our lives. What’s missing is the correct representation of our contributions in various fields. Many LGBTQIA+ individuals are doctors, and experts in different professions, yet their accomplishments are only rarely acknowledged or represented. Instead, the focus often falls on the unfortunate image of some members of the community begging on the streets, which goes viral on social media.Another issue is the way we are predominantly associated with sex and sexuality. While these are important aspects of human identity, we are much more than that. We have other needs and rights that deserve attention. Unfortunately, the media tends to fixate on sexual aspects of the LGBTQIA+ community, reinforcing stereotypes. It’s time for the media to move beyond this narrow portrayal and include us in broader discussions that reflect the full scope of our lives.How has the current narrative of progressiveness in Nepal impacted real change for the LGBTQIA+ community?It’s time to move beyond this narrative of progressiveness. True progress should lead to further development, not be a barrier to it. Unfortunately, the current narrative seems to be stagnating.For instance, when we raise issues with the government, the response often is, “We’ve already given you the right to citizenship. You’re getting citizenship now.” Even when I travel people sometimes ask, “You’ve got citizenship, right? Things are becoming progressive.” This narrative of progressiveness has become an excuse for the government to claim they’ve done enough and to avoid further action.This surface-level progressiveness is used to showcase Nepal as forward-thinking internationally, but it hasn’t translated into real change for people at the grassroots. It also impedes activists’ efforts by providing the government with a shield against criticism. Until this narrative of progressiveness evolves into genuine, accountable action that goes beyond court decisions and performative gestures, it will continue to be a barrier to actual progress. \nThe Federal Parliament last month passed the bill to amend the Enforced Disappearances Enquiry, Truth and Reconciliation Commission Act. Political parties displayed exemplary unity in the course of endorsing the bill, which was promptly welcomed by the international community. If this undertaking succeeds, the remaining tasks of Nepal’s nearly two-decade-long peace process will be completed. In this context, the Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal and Binod Ghimire sat down with constitutional expert and former lawmaker Radheshyam Adhikari of Nepali Congress, who has over the years been closely involved in Nepal’s transitional justice process.As a legal expert, how do you see the latest amendment in the transitional justice Act?Looking at it from a legal perspective, the Supreme Court’s order given in this context is the major basis. The amendment has complied with over 95 percent of the top court’s directives. There is one more context we can refer to. The government in 2018 had prepared a ‘zero draft’ on this issue. The international community had expressed their reservations on certain provisions. Most of the contents of that draft have been retained while addressing those reservations. There are some major improvements. The amendment has taken a more liberal approach to victims’ rights. For instance, the draft had only said that the victims would be consulted for reconciliation but the latest amendment made victims’ consent mandatory. If a victim doesn’t want to give consent, he or she can go to court. This is a major change. Likewise, the draft had said the verdict of the to-be-formed Special Court [with a mandate to hear and decide the transitional justice related cases] would be final. But the amendment has allowed the dissatisfied side to appeal in the Supreme Court. There is a plan for a separate fund to carry out transitional justice related tasks so as to ensure fiscal autonomy for the two transitional justice commissions. This process needs fiscal as well as administrative autonomy. You just mentioned that the new Act has complied with 95 percent of the top court’s directives. Could you elaborate on the remaining five percent?I meant to say that the amendment is closer to the court’s directives. I can’t say it is 100 percent because even they [the Supreme Court justices] at the time said ‘so and so’ should be done on a hypothetical ground as so many things were still evolving. Now, some issues might have become redundant. But most of the things have been addressed. See, first, we should have conceptual clarity. There is a fundamental difference between retributive justice and transitional justice systems. In retributive justice, cases are decided by regular courts based on existing laws while in the transitional justice system we have to look into political, social as well as cultural aspects. This is the internationally accepted approach.The amendment has included a provision of up to 75 percent reduced sentencing. The attorney general, who works for the government, is mandated to recommend this. Isn’t this akin to directing the court? Wouldn’t it instead be prudent to leave that to the court? If that were not done, there would be mistrust and the process may not have gotten sufficient support from the warring sides of the past. In such a scenario, the process may have again failed. A supportive role of the stakeholders will be crucial. Of late, I often urge the victims to cooperate with the process; otherwise it will remain a never-ending process. It’s already too late. So, now we should be pragmatic. We should carry out things on a priority basis. Finding and respecting truth are the first and second priorities. The option to go to court is there, if someone wants so. The fourth priority is reparation. The goal is to establish that no one will need to take up arms and resort to violence in Nepal again. Now, most of the stakeholders are positive about concluding this process. The international community has in fact asked us what type of support we need.It is said the role of Desmond Tutu, who led the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of South Africa, was crucial for the success of the country’s transitional justice process. Do you think the personality of the heads of the commissions will be vital in our case as well?Leadership definitely matters. In Colombia as well, a person of similar stature, who is respected by all sides in the country, led the process. So, the leadership and composition of the commissions will matter. The commissions should be allowed to work and make decisions on their own.There are nearly 64,000 complaints with the TRC and around 2,400 with the CIEDP. How should the commissions carry out their task? Will they deal with each and every case individually? What are international practices and what is a broader conceptual understanding in our case?It is too early to talk about the working modality but I believe most cases should be dealt with in a representative way. But cases of serious rights violations will enter the prosecution stage. Producing sufficient evidence to prove the crimes, however, will be challenging. For instance, some rape victims may not be able to name the perpetrators. They were raped but couldn’t even recognise the perpetrator. In such a case, the state should respect such victims and provide reparation to them. Some complainants may choose not to continue with the cases. Before determining whether certain cases are serious or not, each file has to be checked at least once. So, the commissions need a large number of investigating officers. Field offices need to be set up based on the number and nature of complaints. What kind of involvement of international agencies may be needed for this process?It will certainly need the involvement of international agencies. Nepal’s peace process is basically home-grown but we will also seek support and expertise from international agencies, as we did in the past. We never work in isolation but the areas where we need their support will be decided only after the commissions start their work. We need international experts for certain specialised tasks, such as conducting DNA tests and exhuming bodies buried during the insurgency. The way the international community promptly welcomed the new amendment, it seems that the government and political parties were working in close consultation with them. Is that so?As far as I am informed, everything was done by Nepalis. But there was communication with the international agencies. They had earlier expressed their concerns on the ‘zero draft’ and the issues have been addressed. Therefore, they promptly welcomed it. They obviously are involved indirectly because it is a matter the international community is closely watching. But now we may need their direct support to carry out certain specialised tasks.Why didn’t the amendment even mention the use of child soldiers, crime against humanity and war crime?It is a matter of serious consideration as to whether our cases fall under the definition of serious crimes such as crime against humanity. The commissions will study this aspect as well.Don’t you think the provision of reduced sentencing and overlooking of certain legal aspects may promote impunity?Even now, inmates get a waiver of around 50 percent under the regular legal system. So the provision to reduce sentences is already there.But such sentences are reduced only after serving for a certain time and demonstrating good behaviour. Shouldn’t we have adopted a similar approach in this case?Transitional justice system should be seen a bit differently. Here, I give you an example. In Colombia, the TRC of the country summoned the seven secretariat members of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC). They were first briefed about the charges registered against them. They admitted that they committed the crimes. Then, all of them were acquitted because they spoke the truth. The TRC in Colombia gave priority to finding the truth. If someone showed honesty and cooperated in finding the truth they wouldn’t be punished. But they increased the penalty for those who tried to mislead them through falsehood.Can we say our process is a bit driven by a reparative approach?I again stress that we should look at the transitional justice process differently than how we look at the retributive justice system. It needs a different law, different court and a different jurisprudence.It takes years of rigorous work to complete this process and firm commitment of major political forces is vital. Frequent changes in coalition and unpredictable relations between the political forces is our reality. Don’t you think such instability may hamper this process?This time around, the role of Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli is very positive. Chiefs of the three biggest parties, while addressing a parliament meeting, have expressed their commitment to make this process successful. Their unity on this matter is important. Not only them, all the political parties represented in the federal parliament, except one lawmaker from a fringe party, have supported this amendment. It has thus become a national issue. I hope this consensus will remain intact while picking officials for the commissions and taking the entire process to a logical end.Given your expertise and involvement in this process, you are being seen as a strong candidate for the TRC chair. What is the reality?I have nothing to say as no one has talked to me about this. \nLately, road accidents are taking place almost every day. Thousands of people lose their lives in road crashes every year across the country. What are the factors causing these disasters? Why have the authorities failed to prevent them? The Post's Thira Lal Bhusal sat down with former secretary Arjun Jung Thapa, who was director general at the Department of Roads for years, to discuss the pressing issue.Why are road accidents taking place so frequently in Nepal? There is no one reason for road accidents. On the infrastructure front, factors like design, condition and geometry of a road are crucial. Putting sign boards along the roads and giving vital information about the particular location is necessary. Those signs should be placed properly so all driving vehicles and passengers can see them clearly. Some technical aspects, such as whether the superelevation is properly designed, particularly at sharp bends, matter greatly. These must be regularly monitored and corrected in time. Regular vehicle fitness tests are essential. Experienced and disciplined drivers are equally important to ensure road safety. Some accidents occur when drivers are unfamiliar with the roads. For instance, the accident that took place at Anbukhaireni of Tanahun district on Friday, killing 27 Indian nationals, might have been because of the driver’s lack of familiarity with the road condition. Yet another serious concern is the lack of road discipline. Those who come to Nepal with years-long experience of driving abroad fear driving because of motorists' reckless driving and lack of lane discipline. The recent accident at Jadibuti, killing one scooter rider, could have been avoided if proper lane discipline had been followed. Reckless driving by motorcyclists has remained a big problem in our case. So, a separate lane should be designated for bikers. Similarly, lanes should be designated for vehicles based on their speed. But such rules are never followed seriously in our case. Traffic police have been entrusted with enforcing traffic rules but lack the human resources to enforce them effectively. We need an integrated and centrally controlled digital traffic light management system. We had experimented with a system as a trial for some time after 2015. We called a bid but couldn’t accept anyone as the bidders proposed more than the rate we had fixed. The project collapsed, and that system could never be revived. We badly lack technology in this sector. When we try to import technology, brokers get involved and ruin the entire process. The condition of roads built haphazardly, mainly in the hills, is another major concern. What do you say about that?We have built around 80,000 kilometres of road across the country. Of that, only around 14,000 kilometres fall under the jurisdiction of the road department. The rest of the road sections fall under the jurisdiction of various authorities, such as the Department of Local Infrastructure and provincial and local governments. The busiest roads are those under the Department of Roads. They are highways and regional roads. Only 50 percent of the roads overseen by the Department of Roads are blacktopped and are not maintained properly. Of the remaining 65,000 kilometres of road, only 4,000 kilometres are blacktopped. This means that the road condition across the country is poor and must be upgraded. The government will now develop the Kakarvitta-Gorusinghe section of the East-West Highway as a safe demonstration corridor. There will be proper infrastructure for crossings, grade-separated intersections, controlled entries, fencing for the safety from wild animals and crossings for wildlife. Local vehicles will run on service lanes. If it is developed as planned, it would be on par with Asian standards. Other roads in the pipeline will follow these standards. These criteria are being implemented while upgrading the Nagdhunga-Mugling road section as well. We have miles to go to upgrade our roads to international standards. Why are we failing to make quality roads?We can’t build our roads according to the original design. At times, locals obstruct road construction and force us to change the alignments. Then, we have to build them based on the availability of the land.Are our rural roads fit from the engineering perspective?Around 35,000 kilometers out of the 65,000 kilometers of roads that don’t fall under the jurisdiction of the Department of Roads are built randomly. Local leaders, influential individuals, and bulldozer operators fix the alignments of such roads.How can we rectify the malpractices in this sector?We need to activate the National Road Safety Council urgently. Officials from all the concerned departments and representatives from various stakeholders should sit together in this body and find solutions. Also, coordination has become more complicated in the federal system. For instance, highways are under federal jurisdiction, transport management on highways falls under provincial authority, while road management is under federal jurisdiction. Therefore, an effective coordinating body has become a must. Otherwise, we can’t control the increasing trend of deaths in road accidents. At least 1,700 people lost their lives in 2013, and the then government set a target to reduce it by at least 50 percent by 2020. Instead, the yearly death toll has crossed 2,800 now.While it takes years to complete road upgrading tasks, construction materials are left unmanaged and scattered, making driving along the road very difficult and dangerous. Can’t such things be improved?Contractors are powerful because of their political connection with influential leaders including prime ministers and ministers. Civil servants can’t be assertive when the contractors get political protection. At times, they try to use force to coerce government officials. If the situation is not going in their favour, they provoke locals with a plan to get extension in their contract citing local unrest. Experts say that the government is also to blame as it doesn’t carry out development projects properly. Do you agree?I worked for three decades in government agencies until a few months ago. What I found is that one government devises specific policies, plans and initiates certain projects but successive governments stop them. The new leadership starts its own plans and projects. Then, the contractors don’t get their payment. This is the other side of the story. Another problem is that our ministers, lawmakers and leaders show interest in the projects that deserve the least priority while important projects don’t get attention. For instance, around 30 kilometers of Arniko Highway, which connects Nepal with China, has been badly damaged. This is a very important road for the country. Can’t the government repair and maintain a 30-kilometer section of a highway? It requires just around Rs3 billion whereas leaders have allocated over Rs11.5 billion in the projects of personal interests of leaders. Around Rs4 billion has been allocated under lawmakers’ constituency development programmes and additional Rs5 billion has been earmarked for local bridges. We have allocated around Rs60 billion for non-important projects but we have ignored a crucial road, Arniko Highway, which was built with the support of our neighbour China in the 1960s. Thus we have given unnecessary importance where it doesn’t deserve while ignoring vital development projects. The road accidents are directly or indirectly linked to the government’s wrong policies and plans.Development projects are sometimes said to have failed due to rivalry between some leaders. Do you have any such experience?I will give you an example. In the Biratnagar-Bathnaha cross-border rail project, we had to build over 13 kilometers of the railway. It was around four to five years ago. We cleared over 11 kilometers but locals protested in the remaining section where a station was planned. The locals obstructed work there even as 85 percent of the money for land acquisition had already been distributed. Later, we found that the then minister Aman Lal Modi had provoked the locals to demand for additional money. He demanded a ‘special rate for his men’. But the laws don’t allow it.Some experts argue that to upgrade the quality of our roads, we need to make this sector competitive and, for that, we have to allow the private sector to develop projects. Is it viable?The government is hindering the private sector from entering into this business. They don’t invest without assured returns. They need roads like Kathmandu-Tarai Expressway. The government called for proposals in the build-operate-transfer (BOT) model for this project. They were interested. But the government simultaneously allowed a company to build the Kathmandu-Tunnel Road in the same area. Then the investors felt a risk to invest there. But, the company couldn’t continue the tunnel project. Private sector should be welcomed in this sector but we should create a conducive environment for that. Bangladesh and India have built infrastructure projects under the BOT model. We can do it as well.What do you think about the jurisdictional dispute over the New Road stretch between the Kathmandu Metropolis and the Department of Roads? Who should maintain this road?All the roads within the metropolis fall under the local government’s jurisdiction, as the constitution clearly states. The federal department is managing the roads with the understanding that the local governments are not efficient at maintaining them for now. If a local unit wants to maintain a certain road section on its own, the department should allow it without any dispute. Both sides showed childish behaviour while handling the New Road case. \nCPN (Unified Socialist) leader Ram Kumari Jhakri was among the most active leaders involved in the formation of the party after split with the CPN-UML in 2021. Three years on, she is now the most vocal leader calling for a unification of the two parties. Why didn’t the new party perform well, and what made her lobby for a party merger? Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal sat with former minister Jhakri for more insights.You worked actively to form the CPN (Unified Socialist), but the party couldn’t perform well. It couldn’t even become a national party from the general elections. What went wrong?We formed the CPN (Unified Socialist) out of compulsion. When Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli—who was prime minister at the time as well—dissolved the House of Representatives in December 2020, we firmly stood against his move, saying that it sowed the seeds of political instability. We staged huge protests and moved the Supreme Court against the decision of Oli, our party chair at the time. I was among the petitioners. Once the top court reinstated the House, we expected the party to move smoothly. Unfortunately, that couldn’t happen. The party establishment led by Oli and the rival faction took extreme actions against each other. The agitating faction announced action against the party chair, and the party establishment expelled us from the party itself. When Oli dissolved the House a second time, we protested the move as it brought instability. We were in favour of transforming the party through intra-party struggle, but the situation took some unexpected turns. We didn’t quit the party with a lofty plan of making a new revolutionary organisation. We were compelled to do so.Our new party accommodated many genuine leaders who had been sidelined in the UML. But ultimately, old leaders heavily dominated the new party’s central committee. They were active leaders of their time but were out of touch with the new, changing context. Young leaders didn’t get space in party committees. I proposed recruiting at least 40 percent members under 40 years in the central committee and over 50 percent members under 30 years in the district committees. I made a 29-year-old leader the chair of the district committee in my home district. In 42 days, I attended 36 district conventions where youths in their 30s were elected district committee chairs. I tried to reach out to municipalities to promote youths in the party chapters. But at the central level, old faces dominated party committees. That didn’t attract people to the party or impress the general public. Thus, it failed to gather steam right from the beginning.Many think that Madhav Kumar Nepal’s selection as party chief was a wrong move since he had led the UML for 15 years and become prime minister, and people didn’t find novelty in the new party. Do you think so too?Madhav Kumar Nepal has been the most active leader in the party since its inception. Whatever the party has achieved so far is because of him. But a party leader must mobilise teams with defined roles and responsibilities and continuously motivate and engage them in result-oriented tasks. He works a lot but doesn’t mobilise teams effectively. Observers say the Unified Socialist was formed due to the personality clash between top leaders and that it lacked a national agenda and a clear policy to prove the need for a new party. Do you feel so?Our immediate agenda was safeguarding the constitution and ensuring political stability in the country. We protested the House dissolution guided by the same policy. But when provincial governments were made like satellites of the federal government, we couldn’t play any role in stabilising them.The UML is guided by the policy of People’s Multiparty Democracy, propounded by the late Madan Bhandari. There was a debate on further enhancing the policy in the changed context. A large section of Left intellectuals were interested in contributing to that. We could have engaged them in the process. But our party stopped the debate on that topic as well. We missed the chance of engaging many critical individuals in the discourse and having a relatively different policy. When in the UML, we practised direct elections of party representatives and leaders from the conventions. Unfortunately, leaders of the new party, Unified Socialist, made a statute that gave powers to the party leadership to nominate party secretariat, office bearers and other members. Leaders would pick those who are loyal to them. This regressive approach killed competition in the party.You are known to prefer a more proactive work and decision-making approach. There are rumours that you have been fed up with the party’s lacklustre style and are mulling to join the mother party, UML.If I were to decide only from a personal perspective, I would have done so much earlier because I had multiple opportunities in the past. But I am for party merger because I don’t see any relevance of running multiple retail shops under communist banners because we are not substantially different from each other in terms of policies. Our electoral system has also made it necessary. The Unified Socialist can’t run like this. We must accept reality and decide—merging our party with the UML is better than running it this way. But it seems that the top leaders of the twin parties are still bitter about each other.True, the bitterness lingers on, mainly among the top leaders. We have also made some mistakes. The UML offered some opportunities to the Unified Socialist, and we should have made some offers to capitalise on the favourable situation. At one time, UML leaders proposed our party chair as a candidate for the vacant post of the country’s President. We should have devised our own proposal and made a win-win deal. But we ran away and squandered the opportunity. If Madhav Kumar Nepal had become president on the UML’s proposal, our party might have been reunited with the UML much earlier. I also took an initiative to that end but in vain. Later also, UML chair Oli visited our party chair’s residence to have our party on board the government. But the reaction from our side ruined things. We are certainly not responding to the UML responsibly. Rather than irritate the UML, we must turn each positive gesture into an opportunity for party unity.One more factor is blocking the unity between the two parties. There are a large number of second-rung leaders in the UML who can’t directly confront Oli. They are now encouraging former President Bidya Devi Bhandari to join active politics and trying to make decisions in their favour through her. Oli knows these leaders will support Nepal when he returns to the UML. Why would he [Oli] then merge the fringe party and create another power centre against himself? He knows Madhav Kumar Nepal will challenge him with the backing of the dissidents. It is natural for a leader to think twice before allowing another leader of your stature to create a parallel power centre within the organisation. Even I would have thought twice. This is a major factor hindering party unity.Your party chair and other key leaders seem quite close to CPN (Maoist Centre) chair Pushpa Kamal Dahal and critical of UML chair Oli. Moreover, Oli often lambasts Madhav Kumar Nepal publicly. Will they still merge the parties?In principle, our party is open for unity with any Left party. But party cadres won’t join the Maoist Centre. If our leadership decides to merge the party with the Maoists, a huge number of our party cadres will join the UML. Unity between the UML and the Unified Socialist is natural because we grew up in the same background and orientation. But we are quite different from Maoists. Several groups trying to form new political outfits have failed to emerge as a major political force and sustain themselves. You worked in a big party for years and also helped establish a new one. What are the challenges of forming a new political organisation in Nepal?Political parties sustain if they evolve with society. If you trace the history of the Nepal’s Congress and communist parties, you will see how they have evolved over the past seven decades. They competed against each other but joined hands to fight autocratic forces towards establishing democracy. They have done hundreds of progressive things in society. Their major fault is that they have multiple entry points but no exit policy. The only exit way is the death of the leaders. This has caused unhealthy practices and created dissident groups.The dissidents who didn’t get any space within their party formed new outfits. They also amplified negative narratives against the old parties. It happened with the Congress, the UML and the Maoist Centre. Had there been an exit system in the party, the situation wouldn’t be this bad. But new political parties can’t sustain without their own political ideology and orientation. You may form an organisation, cash in on people’s frustration and achieve some immediate gains, but outfits can’t sustain.But recent electoral trends show that Nepalis are seeking alternative forces and new faces. Can we be oblivious to that?You are right. We have seen such trends in the Panchayat system as well. But garnering votes during elections for one term and establishing a sustainable political force are two different things.  \nParts of the hilly regions in Koshi and Bagmati provinces are likely to experience light to moderate rainfall along with thunderstorms on Thursday, the Meteorological Forecasting Division said.Other hilly areas of the country, including Gandaki Province, could also see sporadic rainfall tonight.The weather forecast for today shows that hilly areas will be partly to generally cloudy, while other regions of Nepal will remain partly cloudy to mostly clear.The rainfall, caused by the influence of monsoon winds, is expected to persist in some regions tonight as well.

Light to moderate rain with thunder and lightning is likely to occur at a few places of Karnali and Sudur Pashchim Province and at one or two places of the rest of the provinces.On Monday, the highest temperature was recorded in Nepalgunj at 34.8°C, while the lowest was recorded in Jiri at 14.4°C.The highest rainfall recorded in the past 24 hours was in Kathmandu at 22.5 mm, followed by Dharan with 15.8 mm, and Bhairahawa with 14.8 mm. \nNepal has recorded above-average rainfall during the ongoing monsoon season, the Department of Hydrology and Meteorology said.According to the department's data, the country received 1,501 millimetres of rainfall as of Monday morning since the monsoon entered on June 10, which is 101.6 percent—1.6 percent above the average monsoon rainfall. Normally, the country receives an average of 1,472 mm of rainfall in the four months of the monsoon—June, July, August, and September. Last year, however, the country witnessed only 1,303 mm of rainfall during the four monsoon months, 88.5 percent of the average.As predicted before the onset of the monsoon, experts anticipated more rainfall this year. Monsoon activities are still ongoing, and two weeks remain for the monsoon's withdrawal.“Like in the previous year, monsoon withdrawal can be extended this year as well,” said Sudarshan Humagain, an official at the department. “We take 90 percent to 110 percent average rainfall as normal. If the average rainfall exceeds 110 percent then only we call it above-average.”Data from the department show that 55 percent of the country witnessed above-average rainfall in the ongoing monsoon. According to the figures, Biratnagar airport witnessed nearly 130 percent of the average rainfall, Dharan bazar 110 percent, Dhangadhi 110 percent, Dadeldhura around 130 percent, Dipayal 160 percent, Surkhet 110 percent, Dang 130 percent, Bhairahawa 110 percent, Okhaldhunga around 130 percent, Jomsom 110 percent, Nepalgunj 110 percent, and Kathmandu around 130 percent.In contrast, Janakpur and Lumle witnessed 80 percent of the average, Simara 85 percent, Pokhara 95 percent, Jumla 85 percent, and Jiri 90 percent.The monsoon season, which typically delivers around 80 percent of the country’s annual rainfall, usually begins on June 13 and ends on October 2. But last year, the monsoon ended only on October 15. This year, the monsoon entered Nepal from the southwest on June 10, three days ahead of the usual onset date. Last year, it started on June 14, a day later than normal.Met officials said the rainfall data could vary, as they are based on data from only 20 major weather stations. The department averages data from around 400 rainfall measuring stations across the country.This year, the division forecasted above-normal rains and above-average maximum and minimum temperatures during this monsoon season, which could unleash extreme weather events such as flooding, inundation, and landslides.Several districts have already reported incidents of landslides, flooding and lightning since the start of the monsoon season.According to the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Authority, at least 235 people have died, and 49 others have been missing in the landslides flood-related incidents since June 10.Officials at the authority said that 136 people—68 males and 64 females—have been killed in landslides, 55 in floodings—30 males and 25 females—and 43 more in lightning strikes. Altogether, 288 people have been injured—126 in landslides, 26 in floods, 39 in lightning incidents, and 136 in lightning incidents. These incidents have affected 3,283 families.Meanwhile, the Meteorological Forecasting Division said light to moderate rainfall will occur in provinces nationwide on Monday night. Some places in Koshi, Bagmati, Gandaki, Lumbini, and Karnali Province could also witness isolated heavy rainfall.Met officials said that the deep depression formed near Jharkhand of India is responsible for the cloudy conditions and rainfall in the country.“Weather will gradually improve from Tuesday,” said Rojan Lamichhane, a meteorologist at the division. Nepal is one of the world’s most vulnerable countries to the climate crisis and has witnessed multiple extreme weather events over the past decade and a half.Evidence suggests that maximum temperatures in Nepal are rising faster, at 0.056 degrees Celsius a year, compared to the global average rise of 0.03 degrees.Experts say extreme weather events—excessive rainfall in a short period, continuous rains for several days after the monsoon, dry spells, droughts, below-average precipitation, and above-normal winter temperatures—have become more frequent in Nepal. \nThe Meteorological Forecasting Division has predicted partly to generally cloudy conditions across the country on Monday.Light to moderate rainfall, accompanied by thunder, lightning, and gusty winds, is likely in several parts of the country.Today, Koshi, Bagmati, Lumbini, and Karnali provinces are expected to experience light to moderate rain, with chances of heavy rainfall at one or two locations. Some areas in the hilly regions of Gandaki Province could also receive similar weather conditions.Tonight, the hilly areas of Bagmati, Gandaki, and Karnali Provinces will continue to see light to moderate rainfall. The forecast also indicates potential rain at a few locations in the rest of the provinces.According to the division, the monsoon trough is positioned north of its average location in the western region and near the average position in the east. The low-pressure system over West Bengal is also contributing to the current weather patterns.On Sunday, the highest temperature was observed in Janakpur at 34.6°C, while the lowest was recorded in Jiri at 14.4°C.The highest rainfall recorded in the past 24 hours was in Lumle at 108.5 mm, followed by Dharan with 28.7 mm, and Taplejung with 33.5 mm. \n\nBe elaborative as possible.
