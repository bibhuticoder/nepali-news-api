Write it in the form of inspiring story not news article or event.\n    \n    Story:\nOnce upon a time, nestled between the towering peaks of the Himalayas and the lush jungles of the Terai, there was a country named Nepal. Though still a developing nation, Nepal was a land of profound beauty and deep-rooted cultural heritage. The residents of Nepal faced many challenges, but beneath these hardships lay a resilient spirit and an unyielding hope for the future.\n\nThis enchanting land, where Mount Everest reaches towards the skies and the air carries a mix of incense and cool mountain breezes, was more than a geographical marvel. It was a mosaic of cultures, languages, and traditions, a testament to human endeavor against all odds. Nepal's history, from the unification under King Prithvi Narayan Shah to its transformation into a federal democratic republic, told a story of aspiration and endurance.\n\nIn recent years, the people of Nepal, with their indomitable will, had taken strides towards rebuilding and reimagining their country. They turned their struggles into stepping stones, each challenge a chapter in their ongoing saga. The shift from a monarchy to a republic had not only changed governance but had woven a new tapestry of democratic values and collective decision-making.\n\nEconomically, while agriculture continued to sustain a large part of its population, Nepal had begun to harness the potential of its picturesque landscapes, developing sustainable tourism that promised to preserve their natural heritage while boosting local economies. Communities living in the shadows of the Himalayas had become stewards of the earth, protecting the biodiversity that made their country unique.\n\nEach day brought new stories. Whether it was a festival in Kathmandu, a technological advance in Pokhara, or a conservation effort in Chitwan, these events were threads in the vibrant quilt of Nepali life. These stories, updated daily, reflected the pulse of progress and the spirit of hope that characterized this resilient nation.\n\nAnd so, as Nepal moved forward, each moment was not just a passage of time but a promise of potential, a narrative of a nation perennially climbing towards tomorrow, guided by the legacy of its past and the dreams of its future.\n\nNews events:\nPrime Minister KP Oli has said Nepal will pursue a balanced foreign policy with both neighbours and will not play the card against each other. The prime minister said countries can be big or small, but their sovereignty is equal. He made the comment at the launch of a book titled “Geopolitics and Blockade” authored by Rastriya Prajatantra Party Nepal Chairman Kamal Thapa in Kathmandu on Monday.Thapa, who served as foreign minister during the Indian blockade of Nepal in 2015 when Oli was the prime minister, has recounted his experiences in the book. India imposed a months-long blockade against Nepal, expressing dissatisfaction over certain provisions of the constitution, which was promulgated in September 2015.During this period, Thapa negotiated with India and sought international support at the United Nations General Assembly. Speaking at the function, Oli dismissed the idea of ‘geopolitics’ as an absolute concept in Nepal’s context. “Geopolitics is about safeguarding our legitimate national interests. We have to clearly communicate our concerns and positions to our neighbours because we don’t play one against the other. We want to be a good neighbour, not a bad one,” said Oli.The prime minister said Nepal wants the same treatment from its neighbours as it extends to them. “We should not tilt to one side, and we have to maintain neutrality in our relations.” This was probably the first time that Prime Minister Oli spoke in detail about Nepal’s foreign policy in general and the neighbourhood in particular.“ We will not allow our soil to be used against any neighbour. We are very much mindful of the ongoing uncertainties in geopolitics. We are in favour of world peace and sensitive to the well-being of our citizens,” said the prime minister.Reflecting on the 2015-16 Indian blockade, Oli said: “We did not surrender. We suffered a lot, and so did our people, but every action we took was in the nation’s best interest.”The prime minister expressed scepticism about the frequent use of the term “geopolitics,” suggesting it has become a convenient excuse for avoiding responsibility.“If we want to hide our weaknesses, if we fail to resolve any issue or fail to give adequate attention to any subject, then it has become easy to blame geopolitics.”“But beyond that, we have to look into our traditional, cultural and social relations. We have to balance our relations. People may say whatever they like, but we must break this habit [of blaming geopolitics]. We have two neighbours, and oftentimes, relations may fluctuate, but we cannot change our neighbours,\" said the prime minister, suggesting that talks and dialogue are the ways to resolve any misunderstanding that arise.After the Indian blockade, Oli capitalised on nationalist sentiments, visited China, and signed a trade and transit agreement, which is widely regarded as a landmark decision.To lessen Nepal’s dependency on India for bilateral and third-country trade, Nepal and China signed the trade and transit agreement in 2016, granting Nepal access to seven land and sea ports for third-country trade. Despite this agreement’s initial hype, just two cargo shipments have been made between Nepal and third countries through China in the last eight years. Thapa, the author of the book, urged the prime minister to fully utilise the transit routes provided by China. “We don’t have any production to export,” said the prime minister. “That’s why progress has been slower than expected.”Oli also signed another agreement with India, focussing on using waterways, mainly cross-border rivers, for transit.\"We reached a transit agreement for using Indian waterways for both bilateral and third-country trade. We did this agreement considering our ties with India. For the country’s justified interest and well-being, we must speak up and ensure our national interests are aligned with international accountability,\" said Oli. Oli also talked about the delay by India in receiving the report of the Eminent Persons Group on Nepal-India relations. The group was formed in 2016 with a mandate to review the Nepal-India relations in a changed global and regional context. The report prepared by eight members from both sides, has been gathering dust since 2018. \"Modiji and I spoke and formed the EPG. I don’t know the reason why the Indian side has been hesitant to receive the report. It was agreed that the report would be presented to the Indian prime minister first, and then to the Nepali side…Not receiving the report is not good, India should accept it. It covers everything from the 1950s Peace and Friendship Treaty to our entire bilateral ties.\"On boundary matters, the prime minister said that both sides should rely on facts and evidence. The key boundary dispute between Nepal and India centres around the Kalapani area and the mouth of the Mahakali River. Nepal claims that the river originates at Limpiyadhura, while India disputes it. \"If there’s a confusion, we should refer to the Treaty of Sugauli. We can resolve the dispute through facts and evidence. If necessary we can negotiate, but dialogue must continue,\" said Oli. Nepal-India relations had hit rock bottom when the Oli government in 2020 published a new map in response to an Indian map issued in November, 2019. The boundary issue remains unresolved with both sides maintaining a status quo.Former minister Thapa recalled the events during the 2015-16 Indian blockade, reflecting on his visits to India, meetings with Modi and former external affairs minister of India Sushma Swaraj and others in an attempt to resolve the tensions between Nepal and India. “Our differences stem mainly from geopolitics, security, and strategic concerns,” said Thapa. He urged the prime minister to work to align with India on these fronts to achieve progress in bilateral relations.Thapa also praised Oli for his tough stance during the Indian blockade and his bold move to sign landmark agreements with China. He urged the prime minister to clear up misunderstandings with India and effectively implement the agreements signed with China during the blockade. Senior journalist Yubaraj Ghimire had offered a critical overview of the book and highlighted some past incidents related to India and China. He gave examples of how Nepal's foreign policy was handled and why it went wrong in several contexts.  \nOver 3,500 people across the country have been infected with scrub typhus since mid-July, the start of this fiscal year.Officials at the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division say they expect more cases in the coming days as the disease typically peaks in September.“Like in previous years, hundreds of people have also been infected with scrub typhus this year,” said Dr Gokarna Dahal, chief of vector Control Section at the division. “More people can get infected in the coming days, as the peak season is still ahead.”Scrub typhus, or bush typhus, is an infectious disease caused by the parasite Orientia tsutsugamushi, a mite-borne bacterium. It spreads in humans when bitten by infected chiggers (larval mites) found in mice.Until a few years ago, it was believed that people residing in rural areas or those working in grasslands or fields were at high risk. However, urban populations are also now being affected by the disease.“Over 100 people from Hetauda Sub-metropolitan city have been infected from Scrub typhus this year,” said Krishna Bahadur Major, chief of the Health Office, Makawanpur. “Although more cases are reported in villages, urban areas are not immune, with several positive cases emerging there as well.”Doctors point out high fever, headache, abdominal pain, backache, joint and muscle pain, red rash, nausea and vomiting as some of the symptoms of scrub typhus infection. Patients with severe illness may develop bleeding which could lead to organ failure. The infection can lead to respiratory distress, inflation of brain, lungs, kidney failure and then multi-organ failure. If not treated immediately, it could be fatal.Nepal saw a surge in scrub typhus cases after the calamitous 2015 earthquakes that killed nearly 9,000 persons across the country.Three months after the quakes, the BP Koirala Institute of Health Sciences, Dharan, alerted the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division about six children with unusual fevers and severe respiratory problems.Serum samples were collected for subsequent tests in Kathmandu and Bangkok, which confirmed a scrub typhus outbreak. By then, four children had already died in the course of the treatment. By the end of the year, 101 cases were confirmed in 16 districts, and four more people succumbed to the disease.The magnitude of the outbreak escalated in 2016 when 831 cases of scrub typhus were reported in 47 districts, and 14 people died by the end of that year.According to the Ministry of Health and Population data, more than 1,026 people were infected with the disease in 2020. Their number increased to 1,999 in 2021, and it rose to more than 2,900 in 2022.In 2023, over 5,000 people were infected with the deadly disease. Doctors say the risk of severity and fatality can be minimised if the patients are diagnosed and treated early, they say.Ordinary antibiotics, such as doxycycline and azithromycin, which are on the essential drugs list supplied by the government to health facilities across the country for free distribution, can cure the disease.However, what is concerning is that many health workers, including doctors, lack sufficient knowledge about diagnosing scrub typhus. Many health facilities also lack reagents to carry out tests for the disease.Doctors can diagnose the disease based on the symptoms, but the risk of misdiagnosis is high, as scrub typhus symptoms are similar to those of other illnesses. They warn that waiting for lab results before starting treatment could be dangerous. It can take about a week to get lab results, and by that time, if the patient is not treated can fall into a coma and suffer multi-organ failure. \nAlmost two months after concluding the party's general convention, the CPN (Unified Socialist) on Monday decided to elect its office bearers through a vote.“Discussions were held for long on whether to appoint the office bearers based on consensus or through a vote,” Jeevanram Shrestha, a leader of the party, told the Post. “Eventually the party has now decided to elect them through voting.”On the second day of the central committee meeting on Monday, the party decided to hold the election for the office bearers.The party’s election body published the two-day election schedule that started Monday. As per the timeline, nomination for the position of office bearers started on Monday while voting will start on Tuesday afternoon.The party's general convention, held in Kathmandu from June 30 to July 5, unanimously elected Madhav Kumar Nepal as chairman, Ghanashyam Bhusal general secretary, and Jhalanath Khanal as senior leader.The party’s statute mentions that it will have 21 office bearers. Since the party charter does not acknowledge the senior leader as an office bearer, the organisation now has to elect 19 office bearers to fill the vacant positions. After the general convention elected the chairman and general secretary unanimously, the office bearers were expected to be appointed based on consensus. However, party insiders said leaders close to Chairman Nepal lobbied hard to hold an election for office bearers.In a brief interview with the Post soon after being elected as party chair, Nepal had said the rest of the party secretariat also will be elected based on consensus. “We are trying to elect the secretariat members based on consensus,” Nepal had said. But, the process to elect the office bearers halted for long. When it started, the party decided to go for the election. “When the general convention was concluded in consensus, General Secretary Bhusal and senior leader Khanal were in favour of appointing the office bearers unanimously,” a party leader told the Post on the condition of anonymity. “Chairman Nepal, who commands a strong majority in the central committee, however, lobbied to elect them through voting.” The party’s central committee members will vote to elect the office bearers. At present the Unified Socialist has a 344-member central committee. A total of 93 central members were announced at the general convention held in July first week, while the remaining 251 members were selected on August 2. In the second phase, a task force comprising Chairman Nepal, senior leader Khanal and General Secretary Bhusal had finalised the names of the central members.As of Monday evening, Rajendra Pandey and Pramesh Hamal, who are close to the party chair, are preparing to contest for the post of senior vice chair position. The Khanal-Bhusal group is adopting a strategy not to field any candidate for this position and support one of them, says a party insider.“Beduram Bhusal, who became general secretary immediately after the formation of the party, was an aspirant for the post of senior vice chair,” the leader said. “However, he has agreed to support Hamal.”Chairman Nepal commands a strong majority in the party while Khanal and General Secretary Bhusal lead a separate faction. But the Nepal-led faction is divided into sub-factions which are led by Pandey and Hamal. The two leaders–Pandey and Hamal–are in a race to become the senior vice-chair. Apart from Beduram Bhusal, Hamal also has the support of senior leader Khanal, said multiple party leaders.Party insiders expect tough competition for the vice chair of the Madhesh Province as well. Ramchandra Jha and Dharmendra Prasad Sah are contesting for the position. Former deputy general secretaries Bijay Paudel, Prakash Jwala, Ganga Lal Tuladhar and Jagannath Khatiwada are contesting for the position of vice-chairs. Paudel and Jwala are from General Secretary Bhusal’s camp while Tuladhar and Khatiwada are from chairman Nepal’s camp. The party’s statute has a provision for seven vice-chairs. Likewise, former secretaries of the party, Birodh Khatiwada, Ramkumari Jhakri, Hari Prasad Parajuli, Nagendra Chaudhary, Rajendra Rai, Ambar Bahadur Thapa, Jeevan Ram Shrestha and Garima Shah, are contesting for the deputy general secretary positions.Deputy general secretary candidates Jhakri, Thapa and Khatiwada are from Nepal’s faction and are close to Rajendra Pandey’s team. Parajuli, Shrestha and Shah are close to General Secretary Bhusal. Chaudhary and Rai, though are from Nepal’s camp, try to maintain neutrality. According to party leaders, there are more than 50 aspirants for the seven positions of secretaries. The party now has to elect a senior vice-chair, seven vice chairs including one woman, four deputy general secretaries, and seven secretaries. Prior to the general convention, the party had amended its statute to increase the number of office bearers to 21, besides the senior leader.A group of CPN-UML leaders led by Nepal split the country’s largest communist party to form the CPN (Unified Socialist) on August 25, 2021. Nepal earlier served as the chief of the CPN-UML for 15 years. They split the party, protesting against UML chair KP Sharma Oli’s decision to dissolve the House of Representatives twice accusing him of trampling the new constitution and instigating political instability in the country.Following a poor performance in local and general elections in 2022, the Unified Socialist is now struggling to retain party members. In the federal and provincial elections, it failed even to secure the status of a national party. The party won only 10 seats in the 275-member House of Representatives in the general elections.Despite holding important portfolios in the federal and provincial governments, the party leaders find it difficult to stop its cadres from rejoining their old party, the UML, let alone attracting new members.  \nNADA Auto Show 2024, Nepal’s biggest automobile fair, kicks off Tuesday in Kathmandu. Electric vehicle (EV) producers and representatives are here to tap into Nepal’s booming EV market, which saw 149 percent increase in imports in the last fiscal year, which ended in mid-July. The country brought in 11,701 EVs worth Rs29.48 billion during this period. The Post caught up with Balaje Rajan, chief strategy officer and vice president for International Business of Tata Passenger Electric Mobility, who is currently in Nepal to participate in the auto show, to talk about Nepal’s EV market, ongoing competition with Chinese EVs and the company’s future plans. Excerpts: How do you observe the Nepali EV market?Nepal has taken a very progressive stance towards EVs. Roughly 85 percent of the passenger vehicle market here now consists of EVs. It's a significant market for Tata Motors because, as the market leader over the last couple of years, we aim to maintain that spot, and we also believe that our products are perfect for Nepali roads. So, I see Nepal as a very important market. I also see Nepal as one of the benchmark automotive markets in the world where EVs are driving the market.The presence of Chinese EVs in the Nepali market is increasing faster. How do you view the competition? What are your strategies for staying ahead?Chinese EVs compete everywhere in the world, including in India. Despite multiple competitors, we have constantly innovated our products, and continue to retain a significant leadership position of about 70 percent plus market share in our home country, India. So, our products are more fit for the kind of use cases people see in Nepal. Our partnership with Sipradi, which has developed charging stations and vehicle servicing ecosystems in Nepal, will be our edge. The strength of our products, plus our partnership with Sipradi, will enable us to continue our success. Given the differences in terrain and infrastructure between Nepal and India, TATA EV customers complain that the range is not as advertised. How is the company addressing the issue?We have been communicating the real-world use range and product sales at the dealership. We have to differentiate between the certified range because of the certification methodology. There is a certain ideal test condition which, for statutory or regulatory reasons, we must declare in India. So, we are careful to ensure that that reference is not taken as the real-life range in a Nepal-type condition where the terrain is very different. We are giving a real-life range indication at the point of sale through our partner Sipradi, and we will also, with our current launch and going forward, declare the real-life range in our advertisements. So that customers would know exactly what the specific range is.What is the share of TATA EV in the Nepali market? Which models are popular with customers?We have had a tremendous run for about the last twenty months or so, starting with the pro-EV policies coming into effect. We are proud to say that last year, we were the market leaders, and this year as well, we have seen very strong retail growth. We want to regain that spot. When our Nexon was initially launched, followed by Tiago, we had a very good customer response. In the fleet segment, the Express T has a very strong response. We are launching the Punch at the NADA Auto Show, which starts Tuesday, and we expect a strong response. We will continue to bring our new models here, which will continue to be loved by customers. What are your sales expectations for the auto show?We expect that everyone will come and first have a look at the Punch. It’s a unique car that delights Nepali customers because of its high ground clearance. It has a compact footprint but is spacious inside to manoeuvre it on small roads. At the same time, high-ground clearance also allows you to go outside the Valley. I expect people to come to look at it and then test drive and give us the same type of commercial success that we saw with the Tiago last year.If demand for EVs continues to grow, when do you expect EVs to replace petrol and diesel cars in the passenger car segment in Nepal?I think over the medium term, for sure, there would be a significant impact on the import of petrol and diesel cars. It is also the right thing for Nepal, considering the abundant availability of electricity and the fact that oil [fossil fuel] must be imported. I think the government's policy of switching to EVs is very positive and progressive. In the medium term, as you can see today, 83 percent of customers are buying EVs. As more EVs are on the road, you will probably see only certain specialist use cases where petrol and diesel might still be around, and EVs will become mainstream in the overall pool.How do you assess the EV infrastructure in Nepal? What are the areas for improvement?The current charging infrastructure in Nepal, supporting around 5,000-6,000 cars, are located aptly. Through our partner Sipradi, there are charging stations every 150 km, offering a combination of fast and slow chargers. Siradi has the widest and most robust network of EV chargers. I met customers earlier today [Monday], and they were all very optimistic about the existing charging infrastructure in Nepal. Of course, as the market expands, the need for more charging stations will increase, and we plan to add accordingly. More chargers could be added based on customer demand in locations where chargers are already installed. For now, the charging infrastructure is reasonable, and future expansion will depend on the growth of EVs. Do you have any plans to open an assembly unit for EVs in Nepal? Currently, we don’t have any plans, but when it comes to any assembly, it is a combination of two things. One is the demand, and the second is the extent of incentivisation. So first, in terms of demand, Nepal has shown robust EV adoption. If the market grows significantly, it could justify considering setting up local assembly. The second factor is incentives, which are very important because any investment needs to provide a return. As of now, the size of the market and prevailing regulations do not make a strong case for local assembly, but we will continue to monitor the situation. \nTen-man Bangladesh progressed into the final of the SAFF U-20 Championship after they defeated defending champions India 4-3 on penalties following a 1-1 draw at the ANFA Complex in Lalitpur on Monday.Bangladesh threw away a first-half lead from Asadul Molla to Rickey Meetei Haobam’s 75th minute equaliser and had to rely on substitute goalkeeper Md Asif’s heroics in the shootout to reach their second consecutive final.The Bengal Tigers now dream of lifting their first ever trophy of the SAFF age-group competition after coming close in 2017, 2019 and 2023.But they will have to overcome a huge challenge from a dogged and spirited Nepal. With India out of the competition, their bid for reclaiming the throne from India has now been made easy.Nepal fought back to beat Bhutan 4-1 on penalties on Sunday after their semi-final battle ended in a 1-1 draw.Only Nepal and India have won the SAFF age-group championship title since its inception in 2015, with the latter winning the last three editions. Nepal won the first two.Nepal will also be full of confidence for the title battle, having beaten Bangladesh 2-1 in the group stage, and will be aiming to reclaim the throne.For Bangladesh, it will be a grudge match, a second chance to take care of an unfinished business and write a new chapter in South Asian football history.The stakes will be high.At Satdobato, India started as favourites and were the first to threaten when Gwgwmsar Goyaray sneaked past the Bangladesh defence and charged at goal with his left-footed strike from close range but goalkeeper and captain Md Mehdi Hasan Srabon came to the rescue with a brilliant save.India kept applying pressure on Bangladesh half but struggled to find any clear chances.Bangladesh were also lacklustre but did not throw away the only chance they got as Molla pounced on a goalkeeping error from Priyansh Dubey to slam from close range—credit to Md Rabby Hossen Rahul who outsmarted Thomas Kanamoottil Cherian to send a low cross that tricked outstretching Dubey before finding the feet of Molla.India had some moments in the final minutes of the first half but could not penetrate the Bangladesh defence line.India switched to a more aggressive mode after the break and it soon started to pay dividends as Bangladesh had to survive a series of attacks.Manglenthang Kipgen curling effort almost found the inside of the net in the 52nd minute.Korou Singh Thingujam should have equalised two minutes later when he only had Srabon to beat but his shot from inside the area flashed wide.Thanglalsoun Gangte then reached twice closer to goal, testing Srabon with a powerful shot and hitting the upright.Bangladesh looked determined not to let their lead slip away easily and made a goal line clearance to deny Goyary in the 64th minute but their first choice goalkeeper Srabon had to be stretchered off after sustaining an injury while trying to foil Goyary’s effort.India took full advantage of it and squared the game in the 75th minute. Naoba Meitei Pangambam utilised the opportunity of a poor defending from Kamacai Marma Aky and cut back for Haobam to send a low ball through the crowded area, giving Asif no chance.Bangladesh received another hammer blow in the fifth minute of added time as Aky was sent off for badly challenging India goalkeeper Dubey.But Asif, who came on crisis and gave away the lead, found redemption in the shootout as he denied Gangte and Akash Tirkey to take Bangladesh into the final. \nMosquitoes are climbing Nepal’s hills and mountains, marking their presence in areas that were not their traditional habitats. Accordingly, the number of people infected by the mosquito-borne dengue virus is soaring. A mosquito-borne vector infection, dengue is mostly found in tropical and sub-tropical climates and is concentrated in urban and semi-urban areas. According to the World Health Organization, about half of the world’s population is at risk of dengue, and around 100-400 million infections occur each year. Most districts of Nepal have seen a surge in dengue infections in the past couple of years, putting ill-equipped health centres, especially in the hills, which are new to dengue, under stress. Since January of this year alone, Nepal has seen over 5,000 cases and at least three deaths. In Sankhuwasabha, the district hospital is short of beds and healthcare workers. The situation there is so precarious that people have ended up on the floor, corridor, chairs, storeroom and hospital compound. This, however, is nothing new in the country—the Covid-19 pandemic exposed our inability to handle large-scale emergencies owing to a lack of infrastructure and preparedness. The fact that a disease like dengue has reached the mountains also confirms that we are amid a major climate crisis. With the rising temperatures, mosquitoes carrying dengue have gained climate adaptive potential and thrived in colder climates—or the previously colder areas that are slowly warming up. Even though other mountain districts like Humla and Mustang haven’t reported any cases this year yet, we cannot deny the possibility. Equally concerning is the lack of community-level cleanliness, sanitation and preventive measures. Government bodies often claim they are searching and destroying the mosquito breeding grounds, but the results do not corroborate their claims. One might wonder what the government is doing amid such a health crisis. The truth is that it is not taking this vector-borne disease seriously. Nor have there been satisfactory efforts to equip the healthcare centres struggling with less manpower, insufficient medicines and space shortages. With the changing nature of mosquitoes, it is also necessary to conduct comprehensive research to be alert in upcoming years. Notably, this year, hill districts have seen thousands of positive cases while Madhesh, the comparatively hotter region, province has reported only 77 cases. This discrepancy also should be taken into consideration.Experts worry that the escalation of risks in those areas that aren’t traditional dengue hotspots has turned things upside down. Our infrastructures have not seen any progress for so long, but things have changed, and endemics have started emerging in new areas. But we haven’t invested in strengthening healthcare infrastructures accordingly. The time has come to heed experts’ concerns and deal with this change by allocating more budget for the health sector and upgrading their patient-accommodating capacities. In the short run, the government should conduct search and destroy programmes, cleanliness and sanitation drives, and increase the supply of medicines and human resources in affected areas. If not, these seemingly trivial mosquitoes can pose more danger in the days to come. \nWhile briefing about her official visit to India, from August 18 to 22, Foreign Minister Arzu Rana Deuba told the Nepali Congress (NC) central committee meeting on Friday that New Delhi’s response to Nepal's new coalition government was ‘positive’. This was a very cautious diplomatic statement. The term ‘positive’ in a diplomatic sense is unambiguously suboptimal in contrast to [being] ‘excited’ or ‘enthusiastic’. There is no hiding the fact that New Delhi was ‘okay’ with the replacement of the Moaist-CPN (UML) coalition by the NC-UML, but it has only sent lukewarm signals on the ascendance of KP Sharma Oli as prime minister, once again. Prime Minister Oli has made it a point to invite his Indian counterpart, Narendra Modi, through Foreign Minister Rana to visit Nepal; Oli has yet to receive a similar invitation despite newly appointed Indian foreign secretary Vikram Misri paying a two-day official visit to Nepal just two weeks ago. Many have viewed this as the lingering trust deficit between Oli and Modi.Be that as it may, New Delhi left no stone unturned to welcome Foreign Minister Rana and exude utmost warmth seldom seen during a foreign minister-level visit from Nepal. Rana had reportedly planned a private visit to Delhi for routine health check-up. On short notice, the South Block not only elevated it to a full-fledged official visit with an immediate invitation from her Indian counterpart, S Jaishankar, but also managed to schedule her appointment with Prime Minister Modi. Additionally, Modi accorded high importance to this meeting by involving key policymakers, including Foreign Minister Jaishankar, National Security Advisor Ajit Doval, Foreign Secretary Misri, Principal Secretary PK Mishra and Indian Ambassador to Nepal Naveen Srivastava.Shifting the neutral gearEqually rare in history, Indian and Nepali media alike positively portrayed Rana's India visit as a new stepping stone to pace the Nepal-India relations stuck in the neutral gear for at least a decade. Several serendipities worked: First, India needed a convincing diplomatic feat to reassure its neighbours that Modi's ‘neighbourhood first’, an overarching foreign policy instrument, has not faced a comprehensive debacle, even after the recent regime change in Bangladesh—India supported Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, who was compelled to resign and flee her country. Moreover, there has been a rise in anti-Indian politics in other neighbouring countries like Sri Lanka and Maldives.Second, Rana is not unfamiliar to Modi and Delhi’s power corridors. As the spouse of the five-time prime minister Sher Bahadur Deuba, she has had several opportunities for introduction and interaction with them. This certainly provides comfort in rolling the conversations, which are valuable in diplomatic dealings. It may seem trivial, but unlike many Nepali ministers, her English language skills and aristocratic sophistication come to her advantage in diplomacy.Third, the New Delhi establishment seemed unapologetically keen to recognise her as a (new) trusted friend in the Congress outfit and see her succeed in the first-ever ministerial responsibility. This has sent tremour waves to national politics back home. The coalition partner UML perhaps sees New Delhi's treatment of Rana as the manifestation of her special relations, something beyond what the government as a whole enjoys. Also, quite a few old-school compatriots in her party have now anxiously raised their eyebrows, assuming that India's trust may inch her forward in a bid to the party’s larger political role and government.Substantive issuesBeyond extensive paraphernalia, both sides claimed to have covered a broad range of issues of mutual interest, including the infrastructure and other projects related to cross-border railways, roads and bridges, Integrated Check Posts, petroleum pipelines and digital financial connectivity. Moreover, the increase in electricity export, reaching 1,000 megawatts, and the opportunities available in power sector cooperation after implementing the long-term power trade agreement were highlighted by both sides after her visit.However, a few contentious issues need deeper explorations than the tangential treatment they received in these bilateral talks. Straight air routes through Indian aerospace for the international flights operated to and from Nepal's newly constructed international airports in Bhairahawa and Pokhara, and clarity on the future of Gurkha recruitment in the Indian army are a few issues Nepal wants to see resolved soon. Operationalising electronic fund transfer gateways as the two prime ministers agreed a year ago and hassle-free processing to implement India-funded ‘small’ local development projects are on India's priority card.According to her post-visit briefing, Rana’s priority list included implementing the Pancheshwar Multipurpose Project and constructing a cross-border bridge over the Mahakali River connecting two countries. It was natural to show interest on her part, as the project agreement was signed 28 years ago when her husband became prime minister for the first time. The Mahakali border river, the location of the project site, runs along the political constituency of Deuba in Nepal’s far west. Furthermore, Rana made Kailali her political base in the same province.Regarding the Pancheshwar Project, India and Nepal’s priorities have diverged for a long time; the former preferred to optimise water use, and the latter focused on electricity production. Currently, as the power trade arrangements are gradually implemented, the interests seem to be converging. The peripheral issues of upper or lower riparian benefits, their components and pricing should no longer serve as constricting impediments. The enthusiasm rekindled in Kathmandu and Delhi to implement the project must not sublimate for decades, like in the past.Rana has had many firsts this time around. She became a minister for the first time, and it was her first official visit to any foreign nation as a minister. Besides, this is her first political and diplomatic responsibility, independent of nurturing her husband's political persona. Finally, her insight in navigating the complex geopolitical manoeuvres confronting Nepal will prove her mettle as a capable future leader of the country. And, her ability to manage the political waves that she created, possibly by winning the confidence of influential southern neighbours, may add at least some score to her future leadership bid in the Nepali Congress.  \nOne of the first major milestones in the development of renewable energy was way back in 1979, when US President Jimmy Carter installed 32 solar panels on the roof of the White House in order to power a water-heating system.Clunky, inefficient and expensive by today’s standards (they weighed 45 kilogrammes each and cost a whopping $28,000 to install), these panels served to heat water for the White House until they were removed during the Reagan administration, undoubtedly as a signal that the new Republican president preferred good old fossil fuels to these hippie-inspired and possibly commie ideas like sustainability and environmentalism.The panels went into storage until at least one of them ended up in a museum in China. There’s a certain irony to that, as China is currently leading the world when it comes to scaling up renewable energy, with twice as many solar and wind projects under construction as the rest of the world combined.Right now, China has 180GW of solar po­­wer under construction along with 159GW of wind power, which far outshines the comparatively measly 40GW under construction in the US. In the first half of this year, China’s clean energy generation has already exceeded the total amount of energy produced by the UK in a year from all sources.The push for renewables could be a lifesaver for poorer states. Existing projects are also being expanded, like the Caipeng photovoltaic power station, which holds the record for being the highest solar power plant in the world, and the Xinjiang solar farm, which has the capacity to power all of Papua New Guinea for an entire year.In fact, according to Reuters, China has installed so many solar panels that they’re generating more energy than the country’s storage and transmission infrastructure can handle! And because China just refuses to think small, it is also manufacturing practically all of the world’s equipment for producing solar panels and—because synergy is a good thing—is also now making over half of all new electric cars sold worldwide.The US is, of course, trying to catch up and one landmark there is that for the first time, the US has this year produced more electricity from wind and solar than it does from coal.It’s not just the richer countries that are taking advantage of this energy revolution. In fact, the push for renewables could be a lifesaver for poorer countries saddled with high fuel import bills for power production.Here, Uruguay stands out as a great example; this South American country was highly reliant on imported oil and gas-based power and, much like Pakistan, greatly suffered from financial shocks whenever the prices of these commodities spiked.Already at full capacity when it came to hydel power and unwilling to set up nuclear power plants that would rely on imported uranium, Ramón Méndez Galain, Uruguay’s then-director of energy, decided to bet on wind and solar power. He financed this by holding a series of clean power auctions, where the private sector was offered long-term contracts at guaranteed rates. This resulted in USD six billion invested in renewables in just five years.In short, he went for the IPP route, only with a focus on renewable energy and with undoubtedly more reasonable terms than we got here in Pakistan. Now Uruguay is reaping the dividends of this approach, with energy production costs having been cut in half and new jobs being created by the clean energy sector.Perhaps as importantly, Ramón’s vision has also practically insulated his country from the shocks of foreign wars and resultant supply issues; from July 2023 to April 2024, Uruguay ran entirely on renewable energy!There are cert­a­inly lessons here for Pakistan, which also pays far too high a price for fuel imports and is unable to withsta­­nd any financial shocks, resulting from high prices of imported fuel.Like Uruguay, we, too, are primed to take advantage of the natural bounties of wind and solar power, and thankfully, we can now see significant movement in that direction. Recently, K-Electric announced its intention of setting up renewable power projects of a combined 640MW. Bidding has already begun on one of these projects, a 150MW solar plant in Balochistan, where the expected tariff is said to be Rs11.2 per unit.In addition, the Sindh government is planning a 550MW floating solar energy project at Keenjhar Lake. Similar projects are underway across the country. When these and other such projects are online, Pakistan’s energy sector may finally have its day in the sun.Some may wonder why we are adding capacity when we can’t seem to be able to pay for the capacity we already have (and in many cases aren’t even using), but we have to understand that there are no quick fixes and that moving towards renewables in a big way will help us save big bucks in the future.— Dawn (Pakistan)/ANN  \nTikTok, a widely popular social media app, is set to come back to the Nepali market after the KP Sharma Oli-led government decided to lift a ban imposed by the previous government headed by Pushpa Kamal Dahal. The then government had raised moral concerns about the app, but now Oli wants to run it with considerable regulatory changes, which will take some time. Even though TikTok was often used to incite communal emotions and spread vulgarity, many took an outright ban as a violation of self-expression and free speech and cited that the app also had positive sides. Therefore, the incumbent government’s decision can be seen as a win-win situation in terms of freedom of expression and the need to demarcate the limits of freedom. For it to be able to resume its operations, TikTok is now mandated to fulfil certain conditions, such as promoting Nepal’s tourism, investing in digital literacy, uplifting Nepal’s public education system and keeping a watch on the content used on the site. According to data before the ban, the app housed around 2.2 million users nationwide, accounting for nearly 40 percent of bandwidth consumption. Having faced revenue loss for months, the social media site seems to have agreed to abide by the government’s directives about its fair use. Now that there will finally be a regulatory directive to handle TikTok, the government should focus on successfully implementing it. The world of social media is quite tricky, as anyone from anywhere can flout the rules and continue misusing them from the backstage. People kept running the app right under the government’s nose using virtual private networks (VPN). How the newly agreed-upon terms of engagement between the social media site and the Nepali government come into effect will be for us all to see in the near future.Being arguably the most misused social media app for causing social unrest, TikTok became the only site banned by the government. However, the concerns raised during its ban apply to other social media apps as well, not least Facebook, X and Instagram, with 10.58 million, 4.66 million and 3.60 million users, respectively. These apps continue to be sites of misogyny, racism, casteism and misinformation, among other concerns of discrimination and discord. But they have also offered many opportunities to voice their opinions and make themselves heard. They have provided youth with employment and entrepreneurship opportunities, not least in Nepal, where we have a vibrant community of social media influencers, celebrities and entrepreneurs. Banning TikTok, or any other medium of expression for that matter, is never a solution, and the current government seems to have realised it. But it should remain vigilant not to let any such social media site become a tool of misuse, exploitation and social discord. The general public should also be sensitised about how grave an impact their irrational behaviours can have in a country like ours which values mutual trust, cooperation as well as religious harmony. There is no other option but to follow the regulations. \nUS President Joe Biden and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday discussed the Russia-Ukraine war following Modi’s visit to Ukraine, along with the situation in Bangladesh where protests led to the ousting of former leader Sheikh Hasina earlier this month.Modi posted online that he discussed the situation in Ukraine with Biden over the phone and “reiterated India’s full support for early return of peace and stability.” He also said the two leaders stressed “the need for early restoration of normalcy, and ensuring the safety and security of minorities, especially Hindus, in Bangladesh.”The White House issued a separate statement, saying Biden commended Modi’s recent visit to Poland and Ukraine, and that both leaders expressed “support for a peaceful resolution of the conflict in accordance with international law, on the basis of the UN Charter.”Last week, Modi visited Ukraine in the first visit by an Indian prime minister in modern Ukrainian history. It came at a volatile juncture in the war launched by Russia in February 2022. Moscow is making slow gains in eastern Ukraine as Kyiv presses a cross-border incursion.Modi urged President Volodymyr Zelenskiy to sit down for talks with Russia to end the war and offered to help bring peace.Modi’s Ukraine visit followed a visit he made to Russia in July where he embraced President Vladimir Putin on the same day that a deadly Russian missile strike hit a children’s hospital. That visit angered Ukraine and the U.S. State Department said it raised concerns with India about ties with Russia.Moscow has been a large weapons supplier to India since the Soviet Union days. Washington in recent years has looked to woo New Delhi  to counter China’s influence.Modi said the two leaders also discussed the situation in Bangladesh where about 300 people, many of them university and college students, were killed during protests that began in July with students agitating against quotas in government jobs before the events spiraled into demonstrations to oust long-serving former Prime Minister Hasina.An interim government headed by Nobel Peace Prize winner Muhammad Yunus was sworn in after Hasina fled to India. Attacks were reported against Muslim-majority Bangladesh’s minorities, especially Hindus, amid the protests.Hindu nationalist Modi’s own government in Hindu-majority India has faced criticism over the years over attacks on minorities, especially Muslims. \nOn Tuesday, the country is expected to witness partly to generally cloudy conditions throughout the day, with light to moderate rain accompanied by thunder and lightning likely in several parts of Koshi, Bagmati, and Lumbini provinces.Heavy rainfall is anticipated in one or two locations within these provinces. Brief thundershowers may also occur in some areas of other provinces, according to the Meteorological Forecasting Division.Tonight, similar weather conditions are expected, with partly to generally cloudy skies across the country. Light rain or thunderstorms may occur in a few places in Koshi, Bagmati, Karnali, and Sudurpaschim provinces, while one or two places in the remaining provinces may also experience light precipitation.The met office said the monsoon trough is positioned south of its average location in the west and near its average location in the east.On Monday, the highest maximum temperature was recorded at Dipayal at 35.8°C, while the lowest minimum temperature was observed at Jiri at 14.9°C. The highest rainfall in the past 24 hours was recorded in Dharan at 28.5 mm. \nTwo people were killed when a motorcycle collided with a Tata Sumo car near Dhansar bridge in Chandrapur-4 on Tuesday.The four-wheeler, with registration number Ba 03-001 Cha 531, was heading east from Dhansar bridge when it struck the motorcycle, registered as Province 1-02-043 Pa 8025, resulting in the deaths of the two individuals on the bike, according to Deputy Superintendent of Police Rajkumar Rai.The deceased have been identified as Tulasi Ojha, a resident of Dharan Sub-Metropolitan City-15, Sunsari, and Bibas Banskota, a resident of Sundarharaicha Municipality-11, Morang.\"Both victims sustained severe injuries and were rushed to Civil Hospital in Chandranigahapur, where they were pronounced dead by the doctors,\" Rai confirmed.Police have recovered the Tata Sumo, but the driver remains at large.The bodies of the deceased have been sent to the Primary Health Care Centre in Chandranigahpur for post-mortem examinations. \nSayyid Badr bin Hamad bin Hamood Albusaidi, the minister of foreign affairs of Oman, arrived in Kathmandu on a two-day official visit to Nepal at the invitation of Minister for Foreign Affairs Arzu Rana.The foreign minister of Oman was received by Foreign Secretary Sewa Lamsal upon arrival at the Tribhuvan International Airport in Kathmandu, said the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on X. The two foreign ministers are scheduled to hold a bilateral meeting and discuss various matters on further strengthening Nepal-Oman relations, according to the ministry. During the visit, Albusaidi will pay a courtesy call on President Ramchandra Paudel and Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli, said the ministry in a statement on Sunday.Nepal and the Sultanate of Oman established their diplomatic relations on January 21, 1977.The two sides exchanged some high-level visits in the past. Late King Birendra and Queen Aishwarya visited Oman in 1986 and the then prime minister Sher Bahadur Deuba in 2017. \nSeparatist militant attacks on police stations, railway lines and highways in Pakistan’s restive province of Balochistan, coupled with retaliatory operations by security forces, killed at least 51 people, officials said on Monday.The most widespread assault by ethnic insurgents in years forms part of a decades-long effort to win secession of the resource-rich southwestern province, home to major China-led projects such as a strategic port and a gold and copper mine.“These attacks are a well thought out plan to create anarchy in Pakistan,” Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi said in a statement, adding that security forces had killed 12 militants in operations after the attacks, but without giving details.The largest of the attacks targeted vehicles from buses to goods trucks on a major highway, killing at least 23 people, officials said, with 35 vehicles set ablaze.Rail traffic with Quetta was suspended following blasts on a rail bridge linking the provincial capital to the rest of Pakistan, as well as on a rail link to neighbouring Iran, railways official Muhammad Kashif said.Police said they had found six as yet unidentified bodies near the site of the attack on the railway bridge.Officials said militants also targeted police and security stations in Balochistan, which is Pakistan’s largest province, killing at least 10 people in one attack.Militant group the Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) took responsibility in a statement to journalists that claimed many more attacks, including one on a major paramilitary base, though Pakistani authorities have yet to confirm these.The BLA is the biggest of several ethnic insurgent groups that have battled the central government for decades, saying it unfairly exploits Balochistan's gas and mineral resources. It seeks the expulsion of China and independence for the province.Naqvi’s comments came after the office of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif vowed in a statement that security forces would retaliate for the attacks and bring those responsible to justice.PASSENGERS KILLEDOn Sunday night, armed men blocked a highway in Balochistan, marched passengers off vehicles, and shot them after checking their identity cards, a senior superintendent of police, Ayub Achakzai, told Reuters.As many as 35 vehicles, including trucks, were set on fire on the highway in the area of Musakhail.“The armed men also not only killed passengers but also killed the drivers of trucks carrying coal,” said Hameed Zahir, the deputy commissioner of the area.Militants have targeted workers from the eastern province of Punjab whom they see as exploiting their resources.In the past, they have also attacked Chinese interests and citizens in the province, where China runs the strategic southern deepwater port of Gawadar, as well as a gold and copper mine in its west.The BLA said its fighters targeted military personnel travelling in civilian clothes, who were shot after being identified. Pakistan’s interior ministry said the dead were innocent citizens.Six security personnel, three civilians and one tribal elder made up the ten killed in clashes with armed militants who stormed a station of the Balochistan Levies in the central district of Kalat, police official Dostain Khan Dashti said.Officials said police stations had also been attacked in the two southern coastal towns, but the toll had yet to be confirmed.Balochistan, which borders both Iran and Afghanistan, is Pakistan’s largest province by size, but the least populated and it remains largely underdeveloped, with high levels of poverty. \nDespite slowed economic growth, Nepal’s external sector appears stronger than ever, thanks to remittances, tourism and the appreciation of the US dollar.Nepal’s three external indicators—foreign exchange reserve, remittance earnings, and tourism income, which represent all international economic transactions between residents of the country—reached a historic high in the last fiscal year that ended mid-July.Conversely, the country’s statistical body, the National Statistics Office, has projected Nepal’s economic growth to be at a meagre 3.87 percent for 2023-24 due to the poor performance of the internal sector. According to experts, the mismatch is due to political uncertainty and growing corruption, as the external sector's growth did not support the internal sector. “It’s good that tourism income has grown. This will generate jobs,” said Nara Bahadur Thapa, former executive director at Nepal Rastra Bank, the country’s central bank. “But at the same time, growing remittance earnings means no job prospects at home. But the money sent by migrant workers has boosted foreign exchange reserves to an all-time high.”Though Nepal is in a remittance trap, the country could turn this into an opportunity by investing in the real sector. “The best option to channel remittances is to bring the private sector on board for investment in the productive sector,” said Thapa.Experts said that since the interest rate on credit has dropped significantly due to the huge amount of liquidity, investment is all that the country needs now. In the last fiscal year, Nepal’s gross foreign exchange reserves increased 32.6 percent to Rs2.04 trillion, a historic high. According to experts, such a trend in a least-developed country indicates no investment. According to the central bank report released on Sunday, remittance inflows increased 16.5 percent to Rs1.44 trillion in the last fiscal year, the highest amount on record.The remittances have been increasing because youth are leaving. In the last fiscal year, foreign employment permits were issued for 741,302 individuals (460,103 first-time and 281,199 renewed). The number is a slight reduction from 774,976 in the previous fiscal year.Under the service account, travel income, or expenditure made by foreign tourists, increased 32.1 percent to Rs82.33 billion in the review year, the highest revenue on record. The total number of tourist arrivals increased to 1.12 million in the last fiscal year from 862,992 in the previous fiscal year.The balance of payments remained at a surplus of Rs502.49 billion in the review year.With the upbeat external sector, the internal sector has remained dismal.“This is because the private sector investment has been shrinking for the last two years,” said Chandra Dhakal, president of the Federation of Nepalese Chambers of Commerce and Industry, the apex private sector body. He was speaking at an interaction in Kathmandu on Sunday.“As Nepal’s industrial capacity is under 40 percent. The private sector investment that contributes 86 percent to the economy has shrunk. This will naturally not generate employment opportunities.”He said that the demand for workers has boomed in the country, where the private sector has thrived. The World Bank said in its recent report that frequent political changes, a significant drag on businesses for over a decade, have dampened private investment. Thriving corruption and lack of accountability have stalled growth and forced tens of thousands of young Nepalis to try their luck abroad.Thapa, a former official at the central bank, said that with billions of dollars in the banks, the incumbent government has an opportunity to take advantage of it.Nepal is currently ruled by an unusual coalition of the two largest parties and this brings both challenges and opportunities. “The government has to facilitate the private sector. It has to ask the private sector to bring forward ready-to-invest projects,” said Thapa. The capital market is gaining momentum. “Through initial public offerings (IPOs) and follow-on public offers (FPOs), the government can facilitate raising money and enable the private sector to invest in the productive sectors that create jobs,” said Thapa. However, political wrangling has paralysed the country.The Securities Board of Nepal (SEBON) and Nepal Tourism Board have been headless for months. Nepal Electricity Authority has yet to open the door for signing the power purchase agreement with the big developers even though the country has huge loanable funds.“The government and the private sector both have to invest,” said Dhakal. “For every rupee the government spends, the private sector has been spending Rs5.”Economists say that the government’s capital injection into the economy would encourage the private sector to pump the investment.Over the years, private investment has remained sluggish. For example, the import restriction imposed by the government two years ago discouraged the private sector from spending, decreasing capital in the market and intermediate goods imports. As a result, public consumption and investment contracted, ultimately impacting the government’s revenue collection.Economists and statisticians say Nepal, which is set to graduate from the least developed countries by 2026, does not have the environment to achieve double-digit economic growth in the immediate future due to low investment from the government and the private sector.The country’s statistical office recently said that, given the ongoing investment, Nepal’s growth rate will neither slow down nor grow. It will remain static. According to economists, everything from wages to business growth and social security to other state benefits will remain static, which will encourage youth to try their luck abroad. \nAs the festive season approaches—a time when consumers are mercilessly exploited—the government is doubling down on its efforts to set up consumer courts for the first time in Nepal, aiming to safeguard consumer rights.It has been nearly two and a half years since the Supreme Court ordered the government to establish consumer courts in all provinces to speed up justice delivery.On Sunday, Industry, Commerce and Supplies Minister Damodar Bhandari told an interaction at the central supply and consumer department of the Nepali Congress that a consumer court would be established within a month.“The presence of the consumer court will have a significant impact on controlling food adulteration, artificial shortage and price manipulation.”But consumer rights activists remain sceptical and dismiss it as yet another lofty promise.Consumers face difficulty accessing water, energy, telecoms and financial services, despite paying for them. Besides, as Nepal’s e-commerce grows, now more than ever, instances of consumers fraud are becoming more prevalent.Nepal’s quality control watchdog, the Department of Food Technology and Quality Control, filed 178 cases in district administration offices against producers and traders for producing and selling substandard food items and animal feed in the last fiscal year. There were 121 cases in the previous fiscal year. Consumer rights activists say the district administrations deliver justice in only a handful of cases.Speaking at the interaction, lawmakers criticised party politics for protecting wrongdoers.They said that whenever market inspection teams raid certain shops or factories, top officials receive phone calls to protect those businesses. On May 28, the budget announced the allocation of necessary funds to set up consumer courts. An official at the Ministry of Industry, Commerce and Supplies said that the government allocated a budget of Rs10 million for administrative expenses to establish at least one consumer court in one of the districts in Kathmandu Valley. However, setting up consumer courts requires a considerable amount of money. As a temporary measure to comply with the Supreme Court’s order, officials plan to rent a separate room in a district administration office to set up the court, which will then begin hearing cases.Consumer rights activists said that forming a court within a month is impossible.“I attended the function when the industry minister Bhandari delivered his speech. We applauded, and the function concluded,” said Prem Lal Maharjan, president of the National Consumers Forum.“This is one of the glaring examples of how promises are made and not delivered.”“A consumer court inside a district administrative office, with a limited budget and few judges, is a joke,” said Maharjan. The top court had ordered the setting up of consumer courts in all 77 districts with separate infrastructure. In mid-June, the Industry Ministry's draft report on establishing a consumer court was submitted to the Law Ministry and sent to the Judicial Council for its suggestions.However, Ashok Kumar Chhetri, spokesperson for the Judicial Council, said he was unaware of the development.“The draft regarding the formation of consumer courts has not come to my notice.” The Consumer Protection Act, 2018, has a provision requiring the government to establish consumer courts. Based on this provision, the Ministry of Industry, Commerce, and Supplies submitted a draft of legislation to the Ministry of Law in September 2019. As the process dragged on, the Supreme Court, on February 20, 2022, ordered the government to establish consumer courts in all provinces to protect buyers' interests amid repeated instances of unfair market practices.A division bench of justices Bam Kumar Shrestha and Nahakul Subedi issued the order after the Forum for Protection of Consumer Rights Nepal moved the court. Although the draft reached the Ministry of Law and then the Ministry of Industry, Commerce, and Supplies, the process has been delayed due to frequent changes in government.According to an official update on the development, the Ministry of Industry cancelled the previous process last year and started afresh by forming a committee.The committee recommended setting up a pilot consumer court in a suitable location within the Kathmandu Valley, in coordination with or on the advice of the Judicial Council, considering the country's current condition and available resources, the official said. According to officials, more consumer courts will be gradually established in other districts based on financial resources.The Industry Ministry official said they realised that setting up just one consumer court per province would not be practical, as people would have to travel long distances for their cases. Therefore, the draft proposes gradually setting up consumer courts in all districts.A consumer court is a specialised court which primarily deals with consumer-related disputes, conflicts, and grievances. The court holds hearings to adjudicate these issues.The public has long been demanding a consumer court to bring unscrupulous traders under a legal framework within a fast-track system.Since consumers often hesitate to get involved in complex court cases, observers believe this has emboldened dishonest traders. They believe that once consumer courts are established, filing complaints will become easier, and the process will involve fewer hassles. \nAnother Olympic Games has come and gone and Nepal’s quest to bring home an official Olympic medal continues to seem like a pipe dream.Nepal sent seven athletes to the 2024 Summer Games in Paris to compete in six different sports but none of them will have anything to show for back home—no athlete from Nepal has won a single official medal in the country’s 60-year Olympic history.But, is it at all realistic to expect an Olympic medal from Nepali athletes?“Winning a medal at the Olympics is not impossible. But our investment and preparation for the Olympics and other international events are woefully inadequate,” said former Olympican Deepak Bista, who currently serves as the president of Nepal Olympians Association and the director of national team preparation, at the National Sports Council. “There are no proper venues for players to train and practice, So how do you compete against elite athletes from around the world?” Athlete Santoshi Shrestha completed the difficult 41.195km track of the women’s marathon event in the 79th position out of 91 athletes. Her timing of 2 hours 55 minutes and 06 seconds was far from her previous best and national record of 2 hours 46 minutes and 23 seconds, which she set on the way to marathon debut gold at Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Dhaka Marathon earlier this year.After the women’s marathon, Santoshi said she could have set a new national record in Paris had she pushed herself more in an endurance-testing track, but she chose not to because of fear of possible injury.“I could not take the risk because the track was very steep after 15 km. I was comfortable and could have made a new record there [in Paris] but I chose to stay in the comfort zone. I want to compete in other tournaments as well,” said Santoshi.But Santoshi’s story could have been different had her preparations and training back home been better. “Further, players, coaches and team management all need to work hard with complete focus and dedication all round the year if they are to bring medals. Sadly, the state of our players is not good enough. They are compelled to find other jobs so that they can look after their families. How can we expect them to win medals at big tournaments?” added Bista, who was the second Nepali athlete to qualify for the Olympics, Beijing 2008.“The players need physical, mental and financial support.”Former Nepali Olympian Sangina Baidya also points to poor investment and preparation in sports for Nepal’s underperformance at the Olympics.“There is a lack of extensive investment in sports infrastructures. The state should be interested in the development of sports. If there is sufficient investment at the youth level, and they get substantial funding, resources and infractures, they can undoubtedly perform better in the international competitions including the Olympics,” said taekwondo practitioner Baidya, who was the first Nepali athlete to qualify for the Olympics, in Athens 2004, through a selection tournament.“In comparison to other successful countries, here in Nepal, preparations for the Olympics start late. They get only a few months of training, which is not enough,” she added.Judoka Manita Shrestha Pradhan has a similar story. She got a training room only two months before the Olympics and she was still expected to win at least one or two bouts in Paris—which is a lot to ask for. Shrestha Pradhan could not progress beyond the first round of women’s 57 kg weight category event.There is no targeted budget for the Olympics programme despite the sports sector getting Rs3.5 billion for the fiscal year 2024/25. Only Rs9 million was allocated for the transport, lodging and food of athletes and officials participating in the Paris Olympics and Paralympics.The Nepal Olympic Committee provides $750 per person to the 10 athletes of the 10 sports under the International Olympic Committee’s Solidarity scholarship, which is insufficient. Swimmers Alexander Shah and Duana Lama trained abroad, in the United States and Thailand, respectively, but the scholarship amount was not enough for them to train at top-class facilities. Lama finished last in her Heat and 30th overall in women’s 200m freestyle.Shah, who was competing at the Olympics for a second consecutive time, will at least return home with some joy. His 51.91 seconds in the men’s 100m freestyle Heat shattered his own previous national record of 52.17 seconds set during the World Aquatic Championship in Doha, Qatar.Badminton star Prince Dahal trained in Sri Lanka and had to travel to Paris 2024 without a coach as Nepali authorities did not send the name of the coach for accreditation and visa process on time.Prince Dahal could not win a single match in the men’s singles group stage. Shooter Sushmita Nepal finished 42nd in the women’s 10m air rifle qualification event. Table tennis player Santoo Shrestha also exited the Olympics from the men’s singles preliminary round.But big investment in sports may not always do the trick.Santoo Shrestha, who competed in the men’s singles table tennis at Paris Olympics, was the only third player in Nepal’s Olympic history to qualify for the Olympics through the selection stage—which is a perfect demonstration of how poor the country is technically.Take Jamaica and Kenya. Athletes in these countries are highly successful in athletics.Jamaica—the home of sprinter Usian Bolt, eight time Olympic gold medallist and world record holder in the 100 metres, 200 metres, and 4 × 100 metres relay—has won a total of 87 medals at the Olympics. Of them 86 have come from track and field.Kenya is the most successful African country at the Olympics, with a total of 124 medals so far. Of them 117 are from track and field and seven from boxing.Ethiopia is another nation which focuses on long-distance events. Their total of 58 Olympic medals have all come in long-distance events in athletics.India was once a dominant country in field hockey and won a record 11 Olympic medals, including eight golds between 1928 and 1980. Although the country experienced a drought in hockey medals, the sport is gradually finding new success after its team picked two consecutive hockey bronze medals in Tokyo 2020 and Paris 2024. Wrestling and shooting are the other sports Indian athletes specialise in.“The government should learn from how other countries prepare their athletes,” said Bista, suggesting that Nepal should target some sports for the 2028 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles and prepare accordingly.Nepal has won a total of 26 medals at the Asian Games. Of them, it has bagged 24 medals in martial arts, which include karate (4), taekwondo (14) and boxing (6). “Nepal should select sports in which Nepal is historically good, for instance martial arts. After that, the government should allocate a significant budget just for the Olympics programme and train the players from the beginning if it expects our athletes to do better,” Bista added.Technically, Nepal’s only medal at the Olympics came in 1988 in Seoul when Bidhan Lama won a bronze medal in the men’s 50kg weight category taekwondo competition. But his medal was counted as unofficial as the sport was then an exhibition event. Taekwondo entered the Olympics programme only at Sydney 2000.But the 2026 Asian Games in Aichi-Nagoya, Japan could be a head start.The National Sports Council has launched Mission 2026 as part of the preparations for the next Asiad and has targeted at least 10 medals. But, sadly, the government has only approved Rs20 million for the programme.“We don’t have enough funding for the programme. This amount will support our athletes for only five to six months. It is unfortunate that the government could not embrace the NSC’s mission.” Bista said, adding that he fears Mission 2026 will just be an ambitious dream.But Bista hopes Palesha Goverdhan may change history despite the odds. Goverdhan became the first Nepali paralympian to pass the selection stage when she qualified for the Paris Paralympics. She won a gold medal in the Asian Qualifiers in China.Govardhan also won a bronze at the 2022 Asian Para Games, becoming the first Nepali para athlete to win a medal at the event.“Palesha is training in London under one of the best trainers,” said Bista who added that the NSC is paying her training fees. \nKunwar has been the MD for just under three years. Before coming back to her homeland to join Daraz Nepal, she worked at different American companies, including Amazon, the world’s biggest e-commerce platform. In this conversation, Kunwar talks about the opportunities and challenges of running an e-commerce enterprise in Nepal, as well as the country’s overall business environment.  \nWhen the Ranjitkar group was established, they discovered this forgotten dance and devoted two years to researching it.Now, they are reintroducing it during Indra Jatra by training the new generation in this traditional art form. \nHe is known for his nationalist legacy, marked by the amendment of Nepal's map to include territories like Kalapani, Lipulekh, and Limpiyadhura, and his strong stance against India, especially during and after the 2015 Nepal blockade.But how did he rise to become the country's powerful man? \nPyakuryal holds a Phd in Public Affairs from the University of Akron, US. In this interview, they discuss Nepal’s elusive political stability, the narratives governing Nepali politics, the role of patriarchy, and the trends in Nepali politics Pyakuryal will be closely following in the years ahead. \nOn a rainy afternoon, I found myself sitting in a microbus. I leaned closer towards the window while passengers crowded inside as if my slight adjustment would miraculously carve enough space for everyone on board. Approximately ten seats were inside, enclosed by a low ceiling that forced unfortunate standers to duck their heads. I was lucky to snag a window seat before the bus picked up more people.After several staggered pauses every few meters—in an attempt to pick up as many stragglers as possible—we finally took off. The ride was slow and uneventful, sans the moisture accumulating on my right shoulder. I clutched the umbrella in my lap and absentmindedly watched the traffic passing by, noting the buildings and restaurants on the route that had grown surprisingly familiar through my first month in Nepal. It was quite different from my first few days here when everything was unfamiliar. Even in America, I had never lived or worked in a big city, and Kathmandu's pollution and bustling traffic were something to get used to. I had grown well-adjusted to crossing roads and dodging motorbikes on my daily walks. Sometimes, I stopped at a local fruit vendor and picked up a mango. I suppose I was “living like a local” somehow, cramming myself into a microbus for Rs20 or buying fruit for another 50. But perhaps more accurately, I realised that my two-month stint in Nepal involved more careful coexistence with the locals than anything.Since arriving, I have coexisted with others as I have never done before. I was overly cautious of the shared kitchen in my living space or ensuring I didn’t step on anyone’s toes on a crowded bus. I turned my eyes from stares as I walked down the street, unsure if it was my clothing, my face, or some other indistinguishable characteristic that marked me as different. My fateful afternoon ride on the microbus also reminded me of my work in Nepal. This summer, I was interning at Siddhartha Art Gallery in preparation for the Kathmandu Triennale in 2026. The theme of the Triennale is coexistence, kinship, and care.During my internship, I realised there was much more to coexistence than difference. One of the goals of the Triennale is to explore coexistence as “kinship among all beings, peoples, cultures, ecologies, faiths, and thoughts.” Kinship, intimacy, and solidarity are all movements of coexistence that build bridges across seemingly vast chasms of difference.In honour of the upcoming Triennale, the Australian Embassy held a reception on July 26, which I was lucky enough to attend, to formally introduce the event and its thematic importance. Gathered in Australian ambassador Felicity Volk’s home was an eclectic group of people from Switzerland to Cambodia, who all seemed excited to learn more about what the team behind the 2026 Triennale had in store for them. Volk opened the reception with a powerful speech on coexistence and art. “As we look around at a world fractured by politics, by war and heightened geopolitical tensions, by climate change and environmental devastation…as we look at all of this, we are reminded that we also need to look for the ways we are united,” she declared, continuing to highlight the crucial role that artists play in healing such deep fractures. “In a time of crisis—a crisis of existence and coexistence—we need the humanity, the self-expression, the healing and the community that the artists and their arts create and nourish.” I couldn’t agree more. As I researched prospective artists for the 2026 Triennale, I noticed that their works often explored similar themes like displacement, indigeneity, and women’s rights while maintaining the individual style and perspective that made their art uniquely theirs. These were also artists across the world, heralding from Nepal to Australia. Somehow, I felt a thread of solidarity running through their creations; they seemed to speak to a universal struggle for liberation. Scrolling through daily news articles and videos, I could sense that commonality underpinning so much of the media circulating worldwide, echoing calls for justice, protest and revolution. In a uniquely post-colonial and digital world, many of us have reckoned that we could not distance ourselves from injustice simply because of its location.The Kathmandu Triennale also brings together international and local artists. I found this form of globalisation potent—not only to wonder but to know that someone was encountering the same obstacles as you thousands of miles away. Here was this foreigner whose name you had never heard of before, and they were grieving, too, and feeling, too. Suddenly, their work did not feel so foreign anymore.In Nepal, I found myself experiencing intimate moments in surprising places. For one, the microbus, where I sat knee-to-knee with a dozen strangers, packed together like sardines. If the bus stopped suddenly, we all lurched forward like our bodies had been tied together and then untied the moment the bus moved again. Afterwards, we laughed, albeit a bit nervously, and apologised to the person whose arm we grabbed for support.Afterwards, I was unsure if everyone on board could still be strangers. I was reminded of my college coursework, which introduced me to intimacy, kinship, and its unexpected manifestations. One of my professors explained that kinship was often established through ritual. However, the rituals didn’t have to be remarkable or elaborate. It could be mundane or sneakily Quotidian. The everyday repetition of crossing the street in Nepal came to my mind. I was initially terrified, missing the well-obeyed traffic lights and pedestrian crossings I had taken for granted in my hometown. But as I completed each daily commute to work, crossing the road grew increasingly more reflexive. It was easiest when I wasn’t alone. Walking alongside a stranger, our steps synchronised, both of us hoping to match the other. It was oddly reassuring. Upon reaching the other side, we swiftly parted ways. Then we were strangers again, united only by one fleeting spurt of required coordination, but this ritual would repeat itself, day after day, with countless people who were strangers but, briefly, not quite. As my time in Nepal ends, I reflect on these fleeting moments of kinship and intimacy in anticipation of the Triennale. Caring for one another is critical, especially as a global community. How can we express that care through artwork? How can we truly hear each other? The first step might be recognising the importance of active rather than passive coexistence. Solidarity is a challenging thing to build. Realising common hardship, demystifying what is foreign, identifying the artist as more than just an artist and the stranger as more than a stranger—only then can we walk together. \nThe shopkeeper asked if I was a police officer or worked for the Nepal police when I went to purchase the book ‘Bepatta Sipahi’. His question surprised me, so I asked why he thought that. He mentioned that many police officers often ask for this book, so he assumed I might be one of them.This made me wonder what was in the book that prompted such a question. I knew it was the sequel to ‘Sipahi Ko Diary’, a book about war and soldiers. But later, I understood why the police were particularly interested in it.The decade-long civil war in Nepal is often said to have set the country back by 100 years. Beyond the physical devastation, it took thousands of innocent lives and shattered countless families. Similarly, the Kedarnath flood on June 16, 2013, also claimed thousands of lives. While these two events might seem unrelated, they are deeply interconnected in ‘Bepatta Sipahi’. These two incidents shape the narrative, plot, and characters.‘Bepatta Sipahi’ is a story of pain, death, and destruction brought by war, affecting both soldiers and their families. Just as life seems to stabilise, more suffering is introduced by the Kedarnath flood. The book revolves around Tej Bahadur Raut, a missing soldier who served in the Nepal Army during the civil war. Through his first-person perspective, the story vividly portrays the horrors of war—the deaths of comrades, the mass graves, and the blood-soaked battlegrounds shared by both soldiers and Maoist fighters. It highlights the tragic reality of Nepali citizens forced to fight against those they once considered brothers and sisters, all due to political turmoil.In ‘Sipahi Ko Diary’, the writer narrates the experiences and struggles of the soldier Shiva Chhetri. In ‘Bepatta Sipahi’, the focus shifts to his fellow soldier, Tej Bahadur Raut, who went missing during the war. During a visit to Kedarnath with his cousin-brother, Shiva comes across Tej's diary. The story unfolds through this diary, where Tej recounts various war incidents, his family troubles, the horrors of battle, and the circumstances leading to his disappearance. Shiva is portrayed as a brave soldier, often leading his team to victories against the Maoists and earning praise from his superiors and peers. However, after a significant incident, his life takes a dramatic turn, opening up a new chapter in the story.The connection between Tej's journey from the civil war to the Kedarnath flood is captivating, keeping readers on edge and eager to find out what happens next. The story is filled with twists, making it difficult to predict the plot. This book blends elements of thriller, suspense, romance, and more, capturing the rollercoaster of Tej's life as he navigates through unforeseen challenges and finds himself in situations he never imagined. The unpredictable turns in his life echo the book's line, \"Manchey le socheko pugdaina vanchan. Tara sochyo vane pugcha,\" meaning, \"People say just expecting, or thinking is not enough. But it is enough.\" The story reflects that while life is full of surprises, expecting the unexpected is no surprise.Katuwal's ‘Bepatta Sipahi’ spans different periods, from the civil war to the Kedarnath flood, with time shifting as the author narrates various events. The book also includes a fragment from the diary of Tej's sister, Niru, a Maoist soldier. Mentioned in Tej's diary, Niru’s account provides insight into the perspective of a Maoist soldier. It reveals why she joined the Maoists and became a soldier, even if it meant opposing her family and turning her brother into an enemy. The book portrays the shared terror of war through her story, where soldiers on both sides are tragically forced to fight against each other.The war scenes in ‘Bepatta Sipahi’ are depicted with striking detail, capturing every nuance of the experience. The emotions involved—firing at the enemy, having brief conversations with comrades, or witnessing their deaths—are conveyed, allowing readers to fully immerse themselves in the story.The writer incorporates multiple languages in the book, including Nepali, Hindi, and English, adding depth and authenticity to the narrative.The book provides a detailed portrayal of the civil war, vividly illustrating the conditions people and villages face. It captures the horror of war through the eyes of a soldier, highlighting the uncertainty of their lives and the government's shortcomings in protecting them. The character often voices frustration over the government's neglect of soldiers' safety.While ‘Bepatta Sipahi’ focuses on Tej's life, the array of characters and shifting settings—from the battlefield to Kedarnath—can initially be confusing. The story may seem disjointed initially, but the connections between the characters and events become clearer as readers progress. However, the book has some literary shortcomings, such as using specialised military terminology that might be challenging for some readers.Although ‘Bepatta Sipahi’ is a sequel to ‘Sipahi Ko Diary’, it stands alone and can be understood without reading the first book. While ‘Sipahi Ko Diary’ recounts the author's experiences as a soldier, ‘Bepatta Sipahi’ shifts focus to the story of a fellow soldier and his search for him, drawing on the author's real-life experiences.Bepatta SipahiAuthor: Chandra KatuwalYear: 2022Publisher: Bhundipuran PrakashanPages: 216 \nTwo and half months after its general convention, the Janata Samajbadi Party-Nepal picked office-bearers and central committee members.Chairman Upendra Yadav was given the mandate to select the party’s leadership without holding an election after the general convention was concluded without electing office bearers following the registration of candidacies for the positions.Chairman Yadav on Monday appointed a 30-member central executive committee and 27 central members and named the members of the central discipline commission, central audit commission, and central election commission.JSP-Nepal announced its central members and nine-member central executive committee after a month of the convention, but it struggled to pick office bearers.Rakam Chemjong has been appointed as co-chairman, while Raj Kishor Yadav, Mrigendra Kumar Singh Yadav, Govinda Chaudhary, Shivalal Thapa Magar, and Bidyut Bajracharya have been named vice-chairmen.The party has named Lalbabu Raut and Ram Kumar Sharma as general secretaries, while Manish Kumar Suman has been given the role of spokesperson.

Bhaktapur, which sees jatras and festivals round the year, is no stranger to music, dance and celebrations. But this is not an ordinary occasion. The performers in question are Lakhe dancers who are reviving the Ranjitkar Lakhe dance after a century.The young dancers are preparing for Indra Jatra this year, where mask-clad Lakhe dancers roam the streets to rid the community of hardships and suffering. Lakhe, demon deities revered as protectors of people and crops, are thought to reside in the demonic mask. As the dancer dons the mask, the spirit is said to take over.Bhaktapur was once a key site for the Ranjitkar Lakhe performances, but the art form vanished from the city after the 1934 earthquake.“Bhaktapur suffered the most damage during the 1934 earthquake,\" says Ganesh Ram Ranjit, treasurer of the Ranjitkar Group’s Bhaktapur branch. “The destruction left residents struggling to recover for a decade, making it nearly impossible to perform the costly Lakhe dance.”The Ranjitkar Group discovered the extinct dance in the year the group was established. They located a Lakhe temple in Bhaktapur that had closed after the earthquake. After two years of research, they learned that performing the Lakhe dance was seen as a good omen in Bhaktapur and involved hosting community feasts. However, the high cost of this tradition forced many to sell their properties, rendering it unfeasible in the city’s post-earthquake conditions. Over time, the dance was abandoned as more lands supporting these cultural events were lost during rapid urbanisation.“There was a significant decline in our engagement with our cultural heritage,” says Rabi Shakya, a sculptor and Lakhe dance teacher training the new dancers. “The encouraging change now is the strong interest from the new generation, which is making it possible to revive intangible heritage like this dance.”After 100 years, the Ranjitkar Lakhe Dance is making a return to Bhaktapur at this year’s Indra Jatra.“It’s challenging to accurately re-enact the dance since it hasn’t been seen in a century,” Shakya notes. “As a sculptor, I drew inspiration from Bhaktapur’s revered Shree Navadurga Bhawani to create the Lakhe’s mask.” Similarly, the dance was choreographed by studying Lakhe dances from Kathmandu, Patan, and Banepa within the Ranjitkar community, and combining them with traditional steps from Bhaktapur Lakhe dances.“As for the musical instruments, we are using traditional instruments like Dha, Dhime, and Ponga, which are said to excite the Lakhe,” says Rajendra Maharjan, Lakhe dance teacher and musician.Maharjan is one of the experienced Newari arts teachers working to revive the lost Lakhe dance. He is involved in training young students in cultural arts and is now dedicated to the Ranjitkar dance training, with the students practising together nearly every day.“Becoming a Lakhe performer involves more than just wearing the costume and mask,” said Sudin Ranjit, a Lakhe dance student. “We must train extensively with our teachers, and it demands a lot of hard work.”To Ranjit, a resident of Bhaktapur, the training is more than learning a new craft; it is a matter of protecting culture. Growing up only interested in instruments, he slowly understood how important continuing cultural practices like Lakhe dances is for their community.“The dance will not only bolster Bhaktapur’s cultural pride but also boost tourism and create jobs,” says Dr Purushottam Lochan Shrestha, a professor and researcher specialising in Bhaktapur and Newari culture.Shrestha notes that reviving the dance would offer employment to everyone involved, from the dancers and the sculptor making the masks to those participating in the rituals. “Economic centres throughout the city, from small businesses to large industries, will benefit from the influx of tourists attracted by the Lakhe dance,” Shrestha adds, commending the Ranjitkar group's initiative.Once the Ranjitkar community revitalises the Lakhe dance, the Ranjitkar group plans to set up a new Guthi house with a fresh community fund and organise annual events for the dance.“The Lakhe dance won’t let them separate,” Shakya remarks.In today’s globalised world, where identity often merges into a homogenised blend, shared cultural practices provide a sense of connection and belonging. This new Lakhe dance embodies that spirit of togetherness for the community involved.“Reviving the dance after 100 years,” Shakya says, “is about preserving our culture for the next 300 years.” \nThe Lions Club of Kathmandu Corporate, Nepal MD325-D has felicitated various personalities as part of its endeavour to recognise the contribution of the individuals and business entities for the society.As part of its campaign, the Lions Club of Kathmandu honoured Prateek Pradhan with Social Journalism Award, Sylapa T Rimponche with Social Spiritual Award, Erika Gurung with Social Player Award, Ramesh Corporation with Social Corporate House Award, Rajendra Malla with Social Corporate Leader Award and Rajesh Hamal with Social Celebrity Award.Likewise, Chandra Ghimire is honoured with Social Bureaucratic Award, Binod Das with Sports Management Award, Anil Kedia with Social Academic Award, Mohan Ojha with Social Management Award and Surya Nepal with Corporate Social Responsibility Award.The Lionism embarked in Nepal in 1971 as the Lions Club of Biratnagar under the stewardship of former Prime Minister Matrika Prasad Koirala.The Lions Clubs International says it has over 2,000 clubs operating across the nation. \nThe government has declared a public holiday in the Kathmandu Valley on Sunday to celebrate the Bhoto Jatra.On the occasion of the festival, a public holiday has been declared in the three districts of Kathmandu Valley [Kathmandu, Lalitpur, and Bhaktapur], according to a statement by Narayan Prasad Bhattarai, spokesperson for the Ministry of Home Affairs, on Friday.The government announces a public holiday each year on this occasion.The month-long chariot-pulling festival of Rato Machhindranath concludes with the displaying of a bhoto (a jewel-studded vest) at Jawalakhel, Lalitpur. It is an annual cultural and religious ritual of displaying the black jewel-studded vest believed to be of then Nagraj, the serpent King.Machhindranath is revered as the God of rain, good harvest and prosperity. Paying homage to Lord Machhindranath is believed to bring good luck and fulfil one’s wishes. \n: BELLAVITA, India’s leading and most celebrated perfume brand, has announced its official launch in Nepal.The company said the expansion marks a significant milestone in its global growth strategy- gy, bringing its premium fragrance collection closer to the discerning regional consumers.

Officials said that after receiving their suggestions, the draft will be sent to the law and finance ministries before it is tabled at the Cabinet.The bill will be registered in Parliament after the Cabinet’s go-ahead.On March 1, the erstwhile government approved the tourism ministry’s proposal to prepare the draft domestic air carriers’ liability and insurance bill.Nepal adopted the Montreal Convention 1999 (MC99) on December 15, 2018. The MC99, however, makes only international airlines liable in case of passenger death or injury. A year after Nepal adopted the MC99, preparation for adopting a similar kind of law started but could not proceed, although the draft had been prepared.Tourism ministry officials say the process was stalled multiple times as governments changed. Since 2019, when the drafting of the MC99 started, the ministry has welcomed 11 ministers.Since 2019, there have been six fatal plane and helicopter crashes that killed 130 people, and all the families of the victims have been barred from a justifiable compensation that would be $100,000 as per the proposed provisions.The draft, however, is ready. And with a political will, officials expect the registration process to be completed within weeks. The draft bill was extensively discussed with the stakeholders before finalising it in 2020.“But the will to serve the public is rare among politicians. No minister was interested in passing the bill. All they did was stunt. No work,” said a senior official at the ministry.The draft of the air carriers’ liability and insurance bill proposes a fivefold increase in compensation from domestic carriers for death or injury.As per the planned law, domestic airlines have to pay a minimum compensation of $100,000 for the injury or death of a passenger. Currently, the minimum compensation for passenger death on a domestic flight is $20,000.Under the Montreal Convention of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), carriers have to pay 128,821 Special Drawing Rights (SDRs) or ($171,018) if the damage is due to the carrier’s negligence or a wrongful act or omission.SDRs are an interest-bearing international reserve asset used by the International Monetary Fund.Under the Montreal Convention 1999, in any crash, the victims’ families have the right to claim unlimited compensation for a wrongful death.The draft bill states that the carrier should make an advance payment when necessary to meet the immediate economic needs of passengers or victims' families.According to the proposed law, a compensation claim should be filed with the airline or its agents within 60 days of the incident or accident. The carrier’s liability limitation for cargo lost and damaged shall be $20 per kg if the damage was caused or contributed to by the negligence of the airlines, it says. The cargo damage is limited up to $5,000.The compensation for the hand baggage, if lost or damaged, shall be $400.Under the Montreal Convention 1999, effective as of December 28, 2019, a carrier’s liability limitation for cargo lost, damaged or delayed shall be 22 SDRs per kg ($29.21 per kg) in the case of destruction, loss, damage or delay concerning cargo carriage.Carriers must pay 1,288 SDRs ($1,709.90) for each passenger in case of baggage destruction, loss, damage, or delay.Likewise, 5,346 SDRs ($7,097.16) should be compensated for each passenger in relation to damage caused by delay in the carriage of persons.The draft also sets the minimum compensatory damages for the third party. Under the proposed rule, the minimum compensatory damages for the third party by an aircraft weighing 10 tonnes or below shall be $25 million.Similarly, the minimum compensatory damages for the third party by an aircraft weighing up to 35 tonnes shall be $35 million and $60 million for the aircraft weighing above 35 tonnes.However, the domestic carriers have been objecting to a few clauses, such as the carrier’s liability for delays and unlimited compensation, which, according to them, is impractical in a country like Nepal.Airlines officials say that, given Nepal’s geographical terrain, climatic behaviour, and airport facilities, Nepali airlines cannot afford to be liable for delays.According to tourism ministry officials, the proposed legislation is a modified version of the Montreal Convention 1999, as several clauses would be difficult for domestic airlines to comply with.As a result of the delay, 130 passengers who died in different crashes since 2019 missed out on compensation in millions of rupees. \nSherpa Hospitality Group (SHG), a subsidiary of Yeti Group, on Friday celebrated significant milestones and unveiled exciting new ventures. The group said that the special occasion marks the first anniversary of Shinta Mani Mustang—A Bensley Collection, the launch of the new Mountain Lodges of Nepal property in Manang, and the upgrade of Kasara Chitwan.The group launched a new property in Manang under the Mountain Lodges of Nepal brand. This new property joins a collection of 14 family-owned premium lodges, providing guests with exceptional trekking experiences along the Great Himalayan Trails.The group said that for over thirty years, Mountain Lodges of Nepal has provided warmth, welcome, and guidance on trekkers’ journeys. “With a focus on simplicity and recovery, Mountain Lodges of Nepal seeks to honour the mountains and the traditions of mountain hospitality. With our fully-supported trips and accommodations, Mountain Lodges of Nepal strives to make the Himalayas easy to reach, safe, and welcoming for people of all ages.”“Our mission is to redefine high-end tourism along Nepal’s Great Himalayan trails, catering to tourists who seek meaningful journeys and bring quality back to our communities.” \nSeriously ill patients at District Hospital Sankhuwasabha are squeezed into every available space besides the beds: corridors, the floor, chairs, and even the storeroom, and outside on the hospital compound.With the spike in new cases of water-borne, viral fever and vector-borne diseases, mostly dengue, the hospital is struggling to cope.“Every day, around two dozen seriously ill patients end up sleeping on the corridor floor and in other areas,” Dr Pranam Jayaru, medical superintendent at the district hospital, told the Post over the phone from Khandbari, the district headquarters. “Our health workers have been working overtime to provide care, but we lack even the most basic supplies like IV stands. Patients’ visitors have to hold the IV bags or we have to improvise by tying them to windows.”This situation is becoming increasingly common in hospitals in many districts, which are seeing a spike in patient numbers amid a massive dengue outbreak. The virus has spread to 75 of the country’s 77 districts, killing at least three people and infecting 5,119 others since January. Two mountain districts—Humla and Mustang—have yet to record dengue cases this year. “For the last three years, we have witnessed a dengue epidemic during the monsoon season,” said Jayaru. “We can only request our staff to serve extra hours, but cannot provide equipment or expand bed numbers.”Doctors say most patients do not want to be referred to other places, as reaching Dharan, the nearest city, in an ambulance takes over six hours. Holding seriously ill patients in ill-equipped hospitals is risky as they lack consultant doctors, blood transfusion services, and high-tech laboratories, among other things.Experts say the deadly virus outbreak in most mountain districts and all hill districts shows the impact of climate change on Nepal’s healthcare system. Despite these challenges, no effective mitigation measures have been adopted.Many hospitals are overwhelmed by the influx of patients, and health workers are forced to place seriously ill patients in corridors and other makeshift spaces, compromising patient safety.“Our health facilities are not equipped to endure the climate crisis,” said Dr Meghnath Dhimal, chief researcher at the Nepal Health Research Council. “Many are built on hilltops or riverbanks, both vulnerable to climate impacts. These health facilities are also unprepared for emerging problems and spiking patient flow.”Of the 5,119 cases of the dengue cases reported, only 77 cases are from Madhesh Province, which is traditionally an endemic area. Health Ministry officials admit that the disease is shifting towards hills and mountain regions due to climate change. They say other factors, such as increased mobility and improved transportation, are also contributing to the spread of the disease to new areas. “Yes, new challenges have increased in areas previously considered less risky, but we have not strengthened our health facilities to deal with the emerging challenges accordingly,” said Dr Gokarna Dahal, chief of the Vector Control Section at the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division. “Our health system is not is not designed to address these evolving risks.”Dengue is a viral disease transmitted by female Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes. According to the World Health Organization, the same vector also transmits chikungunya, yellow fever, and the Zika virus.In 2023, at least 20 persons died, and more than 52,000 were infected by the virus across the country.In 2022, a total of 88 people died, and over 54,000 were infected by the virus. During that period, hospitals in the Kathmandu Valley were overwhelmed with dengue patients, and pharmacies ran out of paracetamol, the most widely used medicine to treat fever.Back in 2019, dengue killed at least six people and more than 16,000 were hospitalised across the country. The virus had spread to 68 districts at the time.Dengue has become a year-round threat in Nepal over the past few years with cases consistently rising each year.Epidemiologists as well as virologists now consider the dengue virus as a major public health problem in Nepal. They also say that despite thousands of persons getting infected and scores dying from the disease, the authorities have not taken the situation seriously. The lackadaisical approach, they believe, is contributing to the spread of the virus. They call for implementing measures such as search-and-destroy drives and awareness campaigns to control dengue vectors.A report by the United Nations titled “Climate Change 2022: Impacts, Adaptation and Vulnerability” states that at least six major vector-borne diseases have recently emerged in Nepal and are now considered endemic, with climate change implicated as the primary driver.The report also showed increasing evidence that climate change has extended the elevational distribution of Anopheles, Culex and Aedes mosquitoes, which carry viruses to above 2,000 metres in Nepal.Dengue-transmitting mosquitoes breed in clean water and bite people in daylight. Uncovered water tanks and other discarded objects such as plastic cups and bottles could be breeding grounds for the dengue-carrying mosquitoes.Symptoms of dengue include mild to high fever, severe muscle pain, rashes, severe headache and pain in the eyes, doctors say. Patients with these symptoms are advised to seek immediate treatment. While there is no specific cure for the disease, early detection and access to proper medical care can prevent death. \nIn a bid to monitor the nutrition status of the population, the Ministry of Health and Population is planning to carry out a nutrition assessment survey in all districts throughout the country in the ongoing fiscal year.Officials said the nutrition status of pregnant women, children under five, adolescents, and new mothers will be monitored during the survey.“We will first assess the nutrition condition of the people of specific age groups and then share the findings with relevant agencies, including the Ministry of Health and Population,” said Lila Bikram Thapa, chief of the Nutrition Section at the Family Welfare Division under the Department of Health Services. “The nutrition assessment survey is crucial for getting the latest picture of the nutrition status of the population.”Malnutrition is a silent crisis in Nepal. The country has made significant progress in reducing stunting among children under five. According to the Nepal Demographic and Health Survey-2022 report, stunting decreased from 57 percent in 2001 to 25 percent in 2022.Wasting, a debilitating disease that causes muscle and fat tissues to waste away among children under five, decreased from 11 percent in 2001 to eight percent in 2022.Wasting or low weight for one’s height in children, if not treated properly and on time, is associated with a higher mortality risk, according to the World Health Organisation.Even though the health survey report showed some improvement in the country’s overall nutrition status, progress is not the same in all provinces. More than 16 percent of the children under five years in Lumbini Province are found to be suffering from wasting—the most immediate, visible, and life-threatening form of malnutrition.Likewise, around 10 percent of children under the age of five years in Madhesh Province have been found suffering from wasting.Officials said the new study was required to determine the latest progress on the population's nutrition conditions.“The nutrition status of the adolescent population will be monitored by schools, while health facilities will monitor children, pregnant women, and new mothers,” said Thapa. “Health workers will also take classes in schools to educate students about the importance of good nutrition and counsel pregnant women and new mothers at health facilities.”Along with the lack of sufficient nutrient foods, poor sanitation and lack of safe drinking water and treatment are blamed for wasting.Doctors say malnutrition during pregnancy increases the risk of complications and maternal and neonatal deaths, as well as the likelihood of low birth weight. It is a major impediment to growth, affecting human capital and economic productivity of a country.Experts say nutrition is directly linked to the country's overall development. Malnutrition affects children's physical and mental growth, which ultimately affects the country’s economic health.It weakens intellectual capacity, limits productivity in adulthood, and increases vulnerability to certain diseases.Nutritionists ask authorities to promote locally available foods, educate people about the importance of a nutritious diet, and provide fortified flour to improve nutritional conditions and reduce dependency on freely distributed foods.Nepal also has an international obligation to improve the condition of malnourished children.To meet the SDG targets, the country needs to reduce stunting to 15 percent from the current 32 percent by 2030, wasting to four percent from the current eight percent, underweight condition to 10 percent from the existing 19 percent, and anaemia to 10 percent from more than 43 percent at present.The SDGs, a follow-up on the Millennium Development Goals, (MDGs), aim to end poverty, hunger, and all forms of inequality worldwide by 2030, and Nepal has committed to meeting the goals. \nLast week, doctors at Thapathali-based Paropakar Maternity and Women’s Hospital diagnosed a new mother in her late 20s with postnatal depression. Her newborn baby was admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit of the hospital due to health complications, and the mother was under care in the maternity ward.“We had to start her on anti-depressants, as she was showing serious symptoms, including suicidal thoughts,” said Dr Pratikshya Ghimire, a psychiatrist at the hospital. “She felt sad all the time, worried about the newborn's future, and had lost her appetite.” Mental health problems during pregnancy are the second leading cause of maternal deaths, after excessive bleeding during childbirth, also known as postpartum haemorrhage, and pre-eclampsia [pregnancy-related high blood pressure disorders. A report on maternal mortality unveiled last year by the National Statistics Office showed that six percent of maternal deaths were due to self-harm (suicide), with most cases occurring during pregnancy.To address mental health problems during pregnancy, the Ministry of Health and Population has started outpatient care services at the Maternity Hospital.“We have not only started outpatient care but also begun screening inpatients for mental health conditions,” said Dr Ghimire. “We have diagnosed around a dozen and a half patients with serious mental health problems.”According to Dr Ghimire, the woman had an inter-caste marriage, and neither her in-laws nor her own parents accepted her marriage, contributing to her mental health struggles. Several other pregnant women and new mothers have also been found suffering from mental health problems, each at various stages of severity.“The Health Ministry had deputed one psychiatric doctor to our hospital, and we started offering outpatient services after her arrival,” said Dr Shree Prasad Adhikari, the hospital's director. “We are also working on training all hospital staff in mental health screening so that conditions can be diagnosed early. Once mental health problems are identified, patients can be referred to specialists.”Officials hope that screening pregnant women for mental health problems and providing prompt treatment will help reduce maternal deaths, which have been rising alarmingly of late.Doctors say prenatal and postnatal depression can occur at any time during pregnancy or after childbirth. Shifts in hormone levels during pregnancy and after childbirth can significantly affect mood. Many women feel anxious about changes happening to their bodies. Some may even have financial concerns and some worry about taking on new and additional responsibilities.Some women experience extreme sadness, anxiety, fatigue, and changes in sleeping and eating habits during pregnancy or after childbirth. Experts warn that prenatal and postnatal depression along with anxiety and other mental health issues, can lead some women to take their own lives.They also emphasise that excessive bleeding after childbirth, also known as postpartum haemorrhage, pre-eclampsia (pregnancy-related high blood pressure disorders), and suicide are preventable. “Timely screening for mental health problems and proper counselling can significantly reduce the mental health problems faced by pregnant women and new mothers,” said Adhikari. “We have launched this initiative at our hospital, and this is something other hospitals should also implement.”Nepal reduced the maternal mortality rate from 539 per 100,000 births in 1996 to 239 per 100,000 births in 2016. For this, the country also received a Millennium Development Goals award. The 2021 census report showed that in every 100,000 live births, 151 women died from maternity-related complications. According to the report, 88 maternal deaths were prevented in every 100,000 live births between 2016 and 2021. Nepal’s target under the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals is to reduce the maternal mortality rate to 75 per 100,000 births by 2030. \nA World Health Organization official stressed on Tuesday that mpox, regardless of whether it is the new or old strain, is not the new Covid, as authorities know how to control its spread.“We can and must tackle mpox together,” said Hans Kluge, WHO regional director for Europe, in a UN media briefing.“So will we choose to put the systems in place to control and eliminate mpox globally? Or we will enter another cycle of panic and neglect? How we respond now and in the years to come will prove a critical test for Europe and the world,” he added.Mpox, a viral infection that causes pus-filled lesions and flu-like symptoms, is usually mild but can kill.The clade 1b variety has caused global concern because it seems to spread more easily through routine close contact.A case of the variant was confirmed last week in Sweden and linked to a growing outbreak in Africa, the first sign of its spread outside the continent. The WHO declared the recent outbreak of the disease a public health emergency of international concern after the new variant was identified.Kluge said that the focus on the new clade 1 strain will also help in the fight against the less severe clade 2 variety that has spreading globally since 2022, allowing Europe to improve its response through better health advice and surveillance.About 100 new cases of the clade 2 mpox strain are now being reported in the European region every month, added Kluge.Mpox transmits through close physical contact, including sexual contact, but unlike previous global pandemics such as Covid-19, there is no evidence it spreads easily through the air.Health authorities need to be on alert and flexible in case there are new, more transmissible clades or ones that change their transmission route, but there are no recommendations for people to wear masks, said WHO spokesperson Tarik Jasarevic. \nDusit Princess Kathmandu is organising a five-day trout festival at its SOI restaurant. The dishes will be available for order from 12:30 pm to 10:00 pm every day till August 30. In celebration of Nepal’s rivers and lakes, which provide an ideal environment for high-quality trout, the Director of Culinary Food and Beverage Service, Chef Utpal Mondal, and his team at Dusit Princess Kathmandu have crafted a menu showcasing the flavours and versatility of locally sourced trout. “As the festive month of Shrawan ends, people focus on healthy and nutritious food. Trout, rich in omega-3 fatty acids, vitamins, and essential minerals, offers a heart-friendly option that checks all the boxes from a nutritional and culinary standpoint,” says Mondal.He adds that the goal of the culinary event is to offer their guests a rare opportunity to experience a wide variety of trout dishes they wouldn’t typically find at home.The event menu features twelve unique dishes, six of which are drawn from diverse culinary traditions across continents. Three dishes are inspired by oriental cuisine, while the remaining three highlight flavours from Nepal and India. The menu has been designed to include various dishes, from soups and starters to main courses, including Mexican, Italian, Continental, and Thai flavours.While discussing the event’s highlights, Mondal said, “The celebration presents a unique opportunity for guests to indulge in a diverse range of trout-based dishes, something they wouldn’t typically have the chance to experience elsewhere.” \nI can vividly remember my first encounter with baking when I was 10 years old. We had just moved to our new home and got a cable connection. The cable opened a world of possibilities, as it gave me access to various contents.This was back in the late 2000s when YouTube would take hours to load, taunting us with its buffering screen. I was particularly drawn to travel and lifestyle channels, mainly TLC, Fox Life, and Food Network, which kept me informed about different foods and cultures. I don’t know why, but I was always drawn to desserts. It was fascinating to see how these miraculous treats made people smile at the end of the meal.Growing up in Nepal, I noticed that baking wasn't very common. While some families did have ovens, they were mostly multifunctional ones used primarily for heating food.I also noticed that most of our desserts didn't require an oven, as they could be made on a stovetop. So, you can imagine my excitement when my mom decided to buy an oven during one of her festive shopping sprees.I could finally feel the joy these channels portrayed. (I blame food writer Nigella Lawson for getting me hooked on a domestic lifestyle.) Then, one day, after watching one of the cooking episodes on television, I finally mustered enough strength and decided to bake something. I distinctly remember wanting to make a chocolate cake for myself after watching one of Rachel Allen’s bake series. I watched all the ingredients used in that recipe and scurried across my pantry, only to realise I didn’t have half of the stuff she mentioned. I then decided to improvise the recipe (a big mistake). I randomly combined the ingredients that I had in a mixing bowl and chucked the batter into my oven, hoping for a magical cake to pop out an hour later.After I saw the result an hour later, I was mortified. The cake was stuck in the pan, refusing to come out, and it was as dense as fudge. I convinced myself that the taste was what mattered most, but when I served a slice to my brother, he made a face of utter disgust.That was the day I realised that baking soda was not the same as baking powder.After this incident, I researched baking and found out it was technical. This was a blessing in disguise for me, as I loved science, and I started to view baking as a science experiment. I then reflected and evaluated how to perfect one's baking skills.I analysed my errors and noted down all the steps I did every time I baked. Home baking is a passion for many. The idea of turning a few simple ingredients into a delicious masterpiece is as enchanting as it sounds.Yet, for many of us, this seemingly magical process can often turn into a series of unfortunate events, leading to crumbled dreams and deflated ambitions. Dense cakes, burnt crusts, rock-hard cookies and unrisen bread, if you are an amateur baker, then you have seen it all. But why do these mishaps happen so often? And most importantly how do we overcome them?From my experience, behind every successful bake lies a series of challenges and mishaps that test even the most dedicated bakers. Baking has its own set of rules that you need to follow to get that scrumptious treat every time. So, to transform a recipe into an actual dish that will impress your friends and family, I am sharing with you some of the tips and tricks I learned from my tumultuous journey as a home baker.First things first, we have to look into the prime appliance that we are working with. Commercial ovens are of two types: one that runs on gas and the other that runs on electricity. We have to look at the oven present at our home and consider its pros and cons. The main benefits of a gas oven are its size and temperature control. One can quickly change the temperature just by twisting the knob, and it preheats much more quickly than an electric one. However, they are known to have uneven temperatures at times and release more humidity, making it harder to properly crisp or brown food. This can result in burnt edges and cold or hot spots. An electric oven, on the other hand, provides more even and consistent temperatures and doesn’t release as much moisture in the air.This dry oven environment makes it easier to brown your items, making it great for baking bread. However, while the dry oven results in more even cooking, you also run the risk of drying out cakes and other baked goods.Also, many people forget to preheat the oven before baking, which is crucial for maintaining an even temperature throughout the baking process. When baking cakes and bread, I like to place a small tray of water at the bottom of the oven to provide moisture and prevent the baked goods from drying out.An oven thermometer can be a baker's best friend, providing a true reading and ensuring your creations bake evenly. I also like rotating the pan midway while baking, as it allows for an even distribution of heat.The next thing people mess up on is measuring and the specificity of ingredients in a recipe. Our moms made our food with their instinct; it is something that they learned along the way, but when you are baking, you cannot instinctively add or omit a few steps.I think that is why we initially had problems with baking. In a culture where cooking comes instinctually, baking challenges us, to be precise. A gram of more or less of any ingredient can drastically alter the outcome. Different methods of measuring flour can yield different results.Every component in baking serves a distinct purpose and function. Flour offers structure, sugar adds sweetness and moisture, eggs bind things together, and butter enhances taste and texture. However, not all ingredients are created equally. For example, using salted butter instead of unsalted might change the taste profile of your meal.Similarly, different flours have varying protein concentrations, which affect the texture of baked goods. The type of sugar used also makes a difference. Granulated sugar, brown sugar, powdered sugar, and speciality sugars like turbinado or muscovado each add unique flavours to a bake.Understanding these nuances and how they interact is critical for getting the intended outcomes. Accurate measurement tools and techniques are essential, but mastering them can be a steep learning curve. So, I would recommend investing in a kitchen scale that allows for more accurate measurements by weight rather than volume.Moving on, leavening agents such as baking soda, baking powder, and yeast are required to make baked goods rise. However, they can also cause confusion and errors. Baking soda needs an acidic component to activate, but baking powder has both an acid and a base, making it self-activating.Using the wrong type of flour or sugar, or using them in incorrect proportions, can result in flat, overly raised, or collapsed cakes. Yeast, being a living organism, presents its challenges.The water temperature must be just right—not too hot to kill the yeast, nor too cold to inhibit its activity. Proofing times and conditions also need to be carefully managed to achieve the perfect rise.Bakers should also be careful about the way they mix ingredients. The method of mixing ingredients can significantly impact the final product. Over-mixing can develop too much gluten in cakes and pastries, leading to tough textures.Under-mixing can leave pockets of unincorporated ingredients, resulting in uneven bakes. Techniques like folding, creaming, and whipping each serve specific purposes and must be executed with care.Finally, home bakers must understand the importance of timing and patience in baking. Even a minute or two can make the difference between perfectly baked cookies and burnt edges.Recipes often provide a range for baking times, but factors like oven hot spots, pan material, and altitude can affect these times. It’s crucial to keep a close eye on your bakes and rely on visual and tactile cues, such as a cake pulling away from the sides of the pan or a toothpick coming out clean, to determine doneness.Baking is also an exercise in patience, a virtue not everyone possesses. Doughs need time to rest and rise, flavours need time to meld, and baked goods need time to cool before they can be enjoyed.Impatience can lead to underbaked centres, crumbling slices, and a general sense of frustration. Cultivating patience is as important as mastering any technique in the baker’s repertoire.Home baking is a journey full of ups and downs, but it comes with great rewards. The obstacles encountered teach valuable lessons in patience, precision, and perseverance.The satisfaction of success, the freedom to create, and the therapeutic benefits make the endeavour meaningful. Whether baking for oneself, loved ones, or as an artistic outlet, the journey is as fulfilling as the result. Embrace the flour-dusted countertops, occasional setbacks, and the joys of home bakingFor a beginner-friendly recipe that involves mixing ingredients and delivers amazing results, try my recipe for fudgy, nutty brownies that I call ‘Bliss Brownies’.Bliss Brownies150g unsalted butter plus extra for the tin150g chopped dark chocolate200g caster sugar½ tsp baking powder2 eggs80g cocoa powder150g plain flour70g mixture of nuts (walnuts and almonds)60g blended papayaMix all the ingredients (except the dark chocolate and nuts) in a blender or a food processor and blitz till you get a smooth paste.Fold the chocolate and the nuts into the brownie batter, making sure that the pieces are evenly mixed in.Grease a loaf pan with soft butter and dust with cocoa powder. Pour the batter into the loaf pan.Bake in a preheated oven at 170c for 40 minutes and let it cool in the oven for an hour. Enjoy with a cup of coffee or, as I like it, a scoop of vanilla ice cream. \nIn a world where acceptance and safety often seem difficult to attain, many queer individuals also struggle to find a safe space to express themselves. They have to hide their true self and face relentless judgement when going to public places like cafes and restaurants.This is the reality for countless LGBTQIA+ individuals. The need for a safe space for this community is not just a desire but a necessity—a space where one can be themselves. This struggle for safety and acceptance can be traced to crucial historical moments, such as the Stonewall Riots of 1969 in New York City.The Stonewall Inn was more than a bar; it was a refuge for the queer community. When police raided the bar, the community fought back. This series of violent confrontations, which began in the early hours of June 28, 1969, between police and gay rights activists, marked the beginning of the modern LGBTQIA+ rights movement. The spirit of Stonewall, the fight for dignity and the right to exist openly lives on in places like Inclusive Galaxy Restaurant in Kathmandu. Inclusive Galaxy beyond a restaurant is an ‘oasis’ for the queer community and beyond.Founded by Bishwaraj Adhikari, Mr Gay Handsome Nepal 2013, a human rights defender, the restaurant proves the power of safe spaces. It’s a place where the community can unite, free from the prejudice and hostility that often permeate their everyday lives.After years of working in the human rights sector, Adhikari and his partner developed the idea for Inclusive Galaxy. What began as a small cafe gradually evolved into a full-fledged restaurant, driven by the growing demand and support from the community.“In developed countries with strong LGBTQIA+ movements, you can find community areas like gay villages. These are created as safe spaces for people whose families and communities have excluded them. They also support new business ideas and pink tourism. I hope to see pink tourism develop in Nepal someday,” says Adhikari. His vision for Inclusive Galaxy goes beyond just being a restaurant. He aims to promote financial independence and empowerment within the queer community.Since its inception in February 2019, Inclusive Galaxy has become a key spot for many in Lazimpat, a relatively queer-friendly area in Kathmandu. The location is essential because the first LGBTQIA+ movement in Nepal started in 2001 through the Blue Diamond Society.Inclusive Galaxy, true to its name, welcomes everyone—queer and non-queer alike—to share a comfortable space. His vision was clear: to create a space where people of all genders and sexual identities could come together without fear of exclusion.“I didn’t want to make it exclusively for queer people because that would be excluding ourselves from society. Different groups need to live together and understand each other,” Adhikari explains.In the early days, the cafe attracted both queer and non-queer customers. However, when some of the residents learned about Adhikari’s identity and the nature of the clientele, there was a brief period of hesitation. “At first, I didn’t understand what was happening, but then I realised my identity was an issue for a few people. I believe people should be judged by others by their character, not by their gender or sexuality. Over time, as residents saw that we operated like any other cafe, they became more comfortable,” Adhikari reflects.Adhikari started Inclusive Galaxy to give queer individuals a place to be proud of themselves, counteracting the self-doubt and insecurity that hiding one’s identity can cause. This turned the cafe very quickly into a community hub. The journey was not without challenges, though. It was difficult to hire staff and cooks from the LGBTQIA+ community, and soon after the restaurant opened, the COVID pandemic made things even harder.Despite these difficulties, the doors of Inclusive Galaxy remained open. During the pandemic, many queer individuals, who were abandoned by their families or afraid to return home, found comfort at Inclusive Galaxy.Since many couldn’t afford to pay for meals, the restaurant provided free food from its resources. As the number of people needing meals grew to 20-30 daily, Adhikari started raising funds within the community.“During my time as an activist, many people came here not only for food but also to see an organisation where the queer community supports one another,” Adhikari says.“The time during COVID was difficult, but it brought me closer to the community.”Four years after its inception, the restaurant has garnered a loyal following. Sarosy Neupane, Miss Pink Nepal 2024 first runner-up, describes Inclusive Galaxy as her second home. She moved to Kathmandu to study in 2022. Being distant from her family, she started visiting Galaxy for meals that reminded her of home-cooked food. Over time, she grew attached to the café because of its welcoming atmosphere.“It’s heartwarming to see people from our community and different walks of life here. The founders even invite us to festivals like ‘Dahi Chiura Khane din,’” she shares.Neupane visits the cafe regularly and sometimes stays until 3 am, engrossed in conversations. “I hope more spaces like this can open in the future. If, unfortunately, this place were to close someday, I don’t think we’d have any other place to turn to,” she adds.Muna Chhetri, a trans woman who has been a loyal customer for three years, shares, “This is my safe space where I can truly be myself. I always feel judged in other restaurants, but that fear doesn’t exist here. It’s where even those who aren’t accepted at home can feel accepted.”Sahara Khadka Chhetri, owner of Pink Tiffany, Kathmandu’s first openly LGBTIQIA+ friendly restaurant and bar, frequently visits after managing the bar, appreciating the convenience of not cooking at home.She notes very few places like this cater to our community, and some even had to close during COVID. “As an entrepreneur, I know that sustaining these spaces is a challenge. But as more spaces like these open, they will make the way for a more inclusive and compassionate society.”The welcoming atmosphere at Inclusive Galaxy has also had a surprising effect on non-queer patrons. Samriddha Jung Rana, a twenty-year-old neighbour who identifies as straight, often visits the café and appreciates the importance of such spaces.“Previously, I didn’t know much about the queer community and didn’t care much. But now, coming into this café, I’ve been interested in their rights and issues. I’ve realised that we’re not so different after all. We are all human,” he remarks.The ventures like Inclusive Galaxy and Pink Tiffany have inspired hope for collaborative businesses between queer and non-queer groups. The recent initiative by the Nepal Tourism Board promoting Pink Tourism in April 2024 is a positive step. Still, Adhikari believes that more support is needed from the government and the private sector.Despite the progress, challenges remain. However, Adhikari remains optimistic about the future. He is working on plans to develop the restaurant into a homestay program in the future.“Like how different planets, asteroids, and stars make up a beautiful galaxy, people from all walks of life and identities make a beautiful society. I am happy that we are assimilating together in this space. We are not so different; we are all different and similar simultaneously,” he says. \nAditya Mishra is a Nepali chef and entrepreneur based in New York. Passionate about elevating Nepali cuisine globally, Mishra sharpened his culinary skills while staging at various Michelin-starred restaurants in the city during his time at culinary school. A recipient of the James Beard Foundation National Scholars Scholarship in 2023, Mishra’s early experiences inspired him to establish his own supper club, ‘The Sewing Tin’, alongside co-founder Akhil Upad.In an interview with Post’s Aarati Ray, Mishra discusses his restaurant in New York, serving Nepali cuisines there and the recipe for his signature dish.How did your cooking journey start in New York?At 14, I told my parents I wanted to be a chef, but they preferred I pursue a stable career like engineering, as many Nepali families do. So, I left for Louisiana in 2019 to study engineering.But, cooking never left my heart so, after a year, I left engineering college and moved to New York City. It’s been three and a half years and my parents only learned about it later. When my mom visited me in NYC and saw my dedication to cooking, she saw my passion and supported my decision.What sparked your interest in cooking from a young age?As a child, I was drawn to cooking shows on TLC. The glamour of cooking, eating, travelling and the prosperity of famous chefs was fascinating.Around age 16, I discovered Chef Anthony Bourdain’s groundbreaking book, ‘Kitchen Confidential’, which shed light on the reality of the culinary industry. I learned how he became a cultural icon in NYC, reshaping perceptions of chefs.I was also fascinated by chefs like Marco Pierre White, who was a mentor to Gordon Ramsay. Their stories of achieving fame while maintaining discipline intrigued me. But, as I grew older and entered the culinary world, I realised it was far from glamorous—it involved dedication and I am glad I persevered.How did the idea for The Sewing Tin originate?The concept of ‘The Sewing Tin’ came when I realised the stark contrast between the romanticised view of kitchen work and its harsh reality. Witnessing the struggles of many kitchen staff—economic hardships, immigration challenges and language barriers—I had to rediscover my love for cooking.During my internship at ‘Junoon’ restaurant, I met my co-founder, Akhil Upad, who shared my culinary enthusiasm despite his preparations for medical college. Together, we wanted to create a dining experience that was more personal and communal, offering fine dining with a sense of community.We wanted our food to tell stories, so we named our restaurant ‘The Sewing Tin’ inspired by the immigrant experience in NYC. When immigrants opened cookie boxes as kids, they often found sewing supplies instead of food.‘The Sewing Tin’ is like opening a cookie box and finding sewing supplies—something uniquely desi, or South Asian. How do you promote Nepali cuisine in New York City through The Sewing Tin?My partner is from Atlanta with Indian roots, while I come from Nepal, so our menu celebrates and reflects both cultures and heritage.We represent our respective cultures authentically. For example, we have a dish inspired by Newari cuisine called kachaila, similar to French Tartar. We present it as Tartar to make it accessible to our customers but infuse it with Nepali flavours, telling stories about its origins and giving diners a taste of my homeland.What do you think of the prospects of Nepali cuisine abroad?I’m on a mission to share Nepali food worldwide. I have served up dishes like chatamari and lamb sekuwa in my restaurant. But I’m still learning and want to explore more of Nepal’s cuisines. My big dream? To make Nepali cuisine reach more places because it’s got something special that can wow taste buds everywhere.How do you see the changes in restaurants in Nepal?The restaurant industry has deep roots in community and bringing people together, dating back centuries. While this core idea remains, modern restaurants have evolved, making changes to adapt to the times.Yet, in Nepal, despite the growing number of restaurants, many lack uniqueness and storytelling, focusing more on making money than fostering a sense of community.I’ve noticed a troubling trend of rising prices, especially for beloved dishes like momos, which makes people question if they're getting value for their money. It seems like profits are taking precedence over creating genuine, authentic culinary experiences.The industry is starting to lose the creativity and passion that once made it special. It might be time for chefs to shake things up, challenge the norm and bring fresh ideas to the table, revitalising the culinary scene with renewed energy and creativity.What challenges have you faced in New York as an outsider?Living in a bustling city like New York as an outsider has its challenges. But, this city is also full of opportunities for those who are passionate. If you stay true to your culture and want to share your story, opportunities are waiting for you.Even though it can be daunting because of the tough competition, the city appreciates determination and expertise. When I started my journey here, all I wanted to do was cook, eat and share the story of Nepal and its diverse cultures. Instead of focusing on the difficulties, I embraced the chance to follow my passion.What do you think about the criticism of blending Nepali food with modern culinary styles?Chefs care about their food—it’s like they’re sharing a story. They’ve put in a lot of effort to become skilled, so let them be creative. It’s okay to give helpful advice but don’t be mean just to criticise. Chefs shouldn’t also just copy what’s popular, they should cook what they truly love. That’s what makes food special and meaningful.Mishra’s signature dish:Confit Duck Chatamari A traditional Nepali delicacy with French influence.Ingredients:Duck (Legs and breast)Rice (soaked overnight)MayonnaiseWhole spices (cloves, cinnamon, cardamom, bay leaf)Red onionGarlicGingerMula ko achar (Fermented radish)ScallionsLemon juiceNepali pepperVinegarSaltSugarProcedure:For the Duck:Season duck with salt and pepper.Cook in a covered pan with whole spices, garlic, and ginger at low heat for 2 hours on a stove (270 degrees in the oven)Increase heat to crisp up the skin (approximately 15 minutes).Shred the duck meat.Confit Garlic Aioli:Mash cooked garlic and ginger and mix with mayonnaise, lemon juice, Nepali pepper and fermented radishes.Pickled Onions:Slice onions and cook in a mixture of vinegar, water, salt, sugar, and whole spices until softened (about 10 minutes).For the chatamari:Blend soaked rice to make a batter, let it ferment for 6 hours, and adjust consistency with water.Assembling:Cook chatamari batter in duck fat for 4 minutes.Top with shredded duck, aioli, pickled onions and scallions.Serve \nCeleus Baral exudes a serene aura when you meet her, and when she tells you she bakes, it makes sense. Even during a brief encounter, you can tell she has the patience needed to be a baker.“You can eyeball cooking, but baking is chemistry. You have to be meticulous. You cannot rush it, or it does not turn out as expected,” says the 21-year-old environment science student. She also runs the online baking shop Bakeleus. Recently, she has also started selling her baked goods beyond her online shop, with her first stall appearing at The Yellow House’s Night Market. Bakeleus’s menu lists a variety of offerings, including jams, granola, tarts, cakes, cookies, cupcakes and brownies. Baral began baking in 2020, during the lockdown, and launched her online shop last year.She grows much of the produce she incorporates into her baking, and believes we should all understand the origins of our food. “This connection fosters gratitude and a deeper appreciation for nature,” she says. Her background in environmental science, coupled with her affinity for the natural world, imbues her creations with a unique artistic sensibility. Each item she bakes is a testament to her creativity and experimentation, as she believes consistent practice is the key to mastery.Despite the demands of being a full-time student, Baral strives to accommodate orders, typically requiring a minimum of 72 hours' notice for delivery. She is a passionate and discerning individual, evident in the love she infuses into her baking. Additionally, Baral advocates for a zero-waste policy at home, ensuring that every scrap of food and all household items are recycled.Three easy to bake recipes you can try at homeMini carrot cakes Ingredients:38 g milk or yoghurt35 g all-purpose flour1/4 tea spoon ground cinnamon1/8 tea spoon ground gingerA pinch of cardamom1 tea spoon baking powder½ tea spoon fine sea salt2 large eggs, at room temperature27 g granulated sugar13 g brown sugar (or 39 g of regular granulated sugar)1 tea spoon vanilla extract27 g extra virgin olive oil33 g carrots, peeled and shreddedChopped walnutsCandied lemon or orange slices (optional for garnish)Cream cheese frosting56.5 g unsalted butter, softened113.5 g cream cheese, softened1/2 teaspoon vanilla extractA pinch of salt250 g powdered sugarDirections:For the cake:Preheat the oven to 195°C.

Yet, pockets of the past remain—small, peaceful neighbourhoods where houses are still made of wood, paths are made of stone tiles, and the stillness of a world that wants to stay intact and immobile. These places are known for tourism, culture, and the restoration of community pride. One such stop is the quiet village of Khokana in southern Lalitpur.Khokana is comparatively close to the mainland urban Lalitpur; from the ring road junction of Bagdole, it takes only a 10-minute drive to reach there. From the airport, you can take a cab directly to Khokana, which will take around half an hour. Get your cameras and hiking boots ready; the area is filled with historical artefacts and hiking trails.However, it is vastly different from the city. It is much nearer to the hills, where stone-paved paths, which could easily be goat trails, are rare in today’s Kathmandu.One such goat trail leads to Sikali temple, a major attraction of the area and accessible only on foot. The pavements are lined with big and small temples on each side, along with ponds that serve as clean water sources and a location for religious rituals. The houses are made of bricks and wood. The concrete invasion, although present, is minimal. Scattered every few hundred metres are small mustard oil mills, co-operative businesses of the locals of Khokana that have existed since medieval times.A site well-recognised for its historical significance, Khokana was even proposed to be made a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1996. Sikali TempleAround an hour’s walk from the historic town, Sikali Temple can be reached, which is also the location for its famed Sikali Jatra.While it can be reached through any public vehicle, a more holistic and adventurous route is to follow the goat trails on the outskirts of Khokana. This route, albeit long, allows for great hiking opportunities, scenic views of the hills surrounding the Kathmandu Valley, and a close-up view of the mediaeval but well-maintained architecture of the local houses.Even if you lose the way, which is very possible, the locals are very welcoming and more than willing to guide you. The main temple itself is three stories tall, and built in the Pagoda style, a common style in many temples in the valley.It is surrounded by a lush grass field which plays the stage to the Sikali Jatra held every year. The temple, like many religious spots around Khokana, is dedicated to the local deity Shree Rudrayani.The Sikali Jatra, a five-day festival that serves as an alternative to Dashain for the Khokana locals, is filled with chariot dances, battle enactments, and storytelling celebrations in the worship of Goddess Rudrayani.Starting from Ghatasthapana in mid to late September, the Jatra is vibrant and an essential experience for every visitor. Historical Khokana townKhokana’s historical town is located around 5 minutes walking distance from the local bus park. The town complex, paved with hand-made stone tiles, is graced with the Indrayanee temple but also has many red-bricked houses built in the local Newari architecture, some of them centuries old.One such house is the ‘Khokana Museum’. Although closed, it is widely popular for being the first house to be lit with electricity in Nepal, as Chandra Shamsher did in 1911.The stand-holder of the first light bulb can still be seen, serving as a historical monument for everyone to see.Similarly, the town complex is also filled with Guthi houses, small ponds, and even the local Ward office. While the Ward office provides a wealth of information for visitors interested in the area’s history, the Guthi halls symbolise the strong community support culture of the locals.The ponds, a notable one present right opposite the Indrayanee temple, have stone taps and remind us of primitive ways of obtaining clean water—a practice many locals are still engaged in.Yet, these ponds are also religious locations, especially used in rituals in the Sikali Jatra.Finally, a stroll through the complex allows visitors to explore old houses and historical artefacts in the serene quietness of Khokana, while the small outlets and Choila places nearby allow you to enjoy the spicy duck or chicken delicacies at the same time.Overall, the historical complex is enough to transport visitors back to a glimpse of the medieval past of the Kathmandu Valley. Mustard oil millsThe most well-known feature of Khokana is its mustard oil mills, which have been operational for hundreds of years and have been using the same methods of preparation since their inception.These mills, scattered throughout Khokana, are often community-owned, and even the ones owned by certain individuals have almost exclusively employed locals.Despite the advent of modern machinery, there is still substantial demand for their products due to the assured guarantee.When I visited one such mill, the local staff informed me that the furnace and oil presser used by them were 300 years old, given by the Patan royalty even before the Shahs became king.In addition to buying pure, organically created mustard oil and pellets, visiting these oil mills offers many educational benefits for international and local tourists alike.Khokana offers visitors a unique glimpse into a preserved bubble of the past through its tranquillity, preservation of ancient lifestyle and cultural elements, and remarkable self-sustenance.  \n“How much oxygen do you have for the summit?”I think this is the kind of question a film producer would ask. But when you're on the mountain, the answer is never clear.I have worked for a long time in the film industry and different art areas, especially photography and engraving.Working in various fields and drawing inspiration from them has become a new normal for me. I have made this approach my way of life without even realising it.I took responsibility for producing the last movie I worked on and shot the behind-the-scenes footage for a documentary. By doing so, I witnessed the entire shooting process and the journey of a movie.In the snowy highlands of Turkey, we had to endure the consequences of the changing climate to shoot ‘About Dry Grasses’, directed by Nuri Bilge Ceylan. The highlands used to be snowy in January, but by the time we got there in the same month, there was no snow. Nature was changing. It was responding to what was happening—to what humanity had done to it. In the end, it snowed, and we shot the intense snow scenes we wanted. But since most of our days were sunny, unlike what the director wanted, we had to shoot in the sunset and sunrise hours. As crew members, we spent many days waiting for the sun to set.Production requires creating opportunities, finding solutions, and being creative for a work of art to come true. For this, patience, endurance, calmness, and timing are necessary. On the other hand, nature wanted us to listen to it and wait for the right time.During that time, I witnessed many of nature's lessons. For example, I experienced extreme cold for the first time. We endured temperatures ranging from -33 degrees to +55 degrees. By listening to nature, surrendering to its forces, and working within its limits, we managed to persevere.No matter how much you prepare or plan during the pre-production phase, if you are working in nature, remember that nature will always have the final say.The film was completed, released, and connected with audiences. Its success at Cannes 2023 was followed by my trip to the North Pole for my project. I returned with a mix of wonderful developments, joys, and challenges. During this process, I experienced life and death, happiness and sadness, losses and awards.I realised the value of being able to breathe comfortably a few days after my father's chemotherapy ended. Just a few days earlier, he had said, \"Well done, my daughter. I'm glad you went!\" All the anxiety and hard work, filled with fears at the beginning, were finally behind me.Before going to Everest, when I was on the verge of giving up, defeated by my fears, I remembered my father's words. Everest reminded me of what he said while struggling to breathe, adding a turning point to my life.What does it mean to say ‘life’s turning point?’ How many turning points can there be in life?Who am I, and what am I doing in this world? How well do I know my own limits? Can I find answers to these big questions? These thoughts sparked my dream of journeying to Everest. Now, after returning, I can say that it turned my life around.“How much oxygen do you need for the summit?” sounds more like “How much do you need to hold on to life?” How many reasons do you find that give meaning to your life, keep you alive, and allow you to breathe? How much can you endure in the face of obstacles, and can you keep believing that a solution will eventually come your way?Can these questions be separated from the idea of measuring and assessing something, from learning its quantity and financial value? Can everything be known with certainty? Should the journey be fully understood in advance, with all its promises laid out? Should it be viewed like a purchase with a price tag, asking, “Is this journey worth this much?”I had never trekked before and had no climbing experience. I had lived at sea level my entire life and had never been to a high altitude.However, this journey was not only about the physical climb but also an inner discovery. After losing my father to lung cancer, his breathing difficulties taught me the fragility of breath, life, and existence. I also mentally prepared myself for the physical challenges I might face. Despite all my concerns, could this journey help me understand the cycle of life and the resilience of the soul?So, how could I make this trek possible? How could I land in Nepal? Despite all the economic difficulties and the many things I felt needed organising, I did my best and believed in it.Since I was embarking on this journey, I felt I should share about my travels and inspire others.Starting with photography, cinema, and engraving, which are already integral parts of my life, I dreamed of documenting and sharing the inspiring aspects of this journey.After months of correspondence and dreaming, it all came true. Finally, I embarked on the journey with the goal of creating photographs, engravings, and documentaries. I learned a great deal from my travels in Nepal, from the people I met, and from every moments I witnessed. I felt incredibly fortunate to have been able to honour my father’s memory with the peace and serenity I experienced in the Himalayas.During my 15-day journey to Everest Base Camp, I encountered nature’s masterpieces at every turn. As concerns like “How will I endure?” and “How will I finish?” started to weigh on me, the mountains suddenly parted with the clouds and gazed down at me.It was amazing to witness the appearance of ‘Gods’ that I had never seen before, in such immense size and in such a close, awe-inspiring manner beside me during that silent walk.As someone who came from one of the most crowded cities in the world, Istanbul, while I struggled with my daily questions and uncertainties, trying to control everything, they stood there calmly, as if answering me.They were just there—before and after.My guide, Lakhpa Sherpa, always reminded me not to worry about how high we were, how long it would take to reach our accommodation, or what the weather would be like. He encouraged me to live in the moment, and he was right.He advised me to focus on my breathing, not to get thirsty, to eat enough, and to appreciate the extraordinary beauty of the journey. In the mountains, plans dissolve and each moment is embraced as it comes.All the good wishes, prayers, and everything encountered along the way were for the journey itself. The mountain was full of life, secrets, and everything I had wondered about.This 15-day journey to Everest Base Camp was a solo adventure, yet I wouldn't have been able to complete it without my guide, Lhakpa, and my porter. Additionally, I was fortunate enough to experience the hospitality, generosity, and honesty at Trekkers Paradise, which organised the entire journey and provided guidance.I witnessed how dedication and sincerity are crucial in completing a journey safely and healthily. Ghanshyam Sharma, from Trekkers Paradise and Sauraj Jhingan, a climber who summited the Everest in 2018, shared their experiences with me during the journey.They experienced the 2015 earthquake while they were at the Everest Base Camp.As a filmmaker, their role as actors, and attention to detail played a significant role in bringing my dream photography and documentary project to life.The sponsors of my journey were Turkish Airlines, The North Face, Apple, Canon, and Stanley. My supporters include Oscar International College and Nepal Film Campus. Throughout the journey, I shared many experiences, memories, and countless photos and images with my students.On my way back home after 21 days, I celebrated my birthday on the plane. From the right window, the Himalayas bid me farewell. I felt like I had opened a new chapter in my life, and I was certain that I would return.I had made many friends and memories in Nepal.For now, I will be working on a documentary and preparing for a photography and engraving exhibition titled ‘My Soul Beyond the Mountain’.To the Himalayas: This summer was spent with you, but we will meet again soon. \nWe spent five days in Sri Lanka two weeks ago, driving up and down the island, covering almost 70 percent of its territory. Our tour spanned over 1,000 kilometres, including hills, beach spots, and heritage and religious sites.Our first stop in Sri Lanka was Colombo’s Bandaranaike International Airport. We were greeted by a warm and humid breeze when we exited the airport. The host briefed us (a group of journalists) that heavy rainfall has affected areas across Sri Lanka since mid-May 2024. Rain and storms intensified on June 1, with the most significant effects in the south and west of the country. We were lucky to have no rain in the forecast.On the first night, we checked into the lavish Jetwing Lake resort, an opulent sanctuary amidst the lush landscape. The resort’s expansive grounds were a retreat, offering a glimpse of Sri Lanka's natural beauty. We feasted on delicious cuisine, every bite exploding with flavour, introducing us to the island’s famed culinary delights. On June 7, early morning, the sun shone brightly, previewing the promise of an incredible journey ahead. We set off early the following day, eager to explore the mysteries of this enchanting island. As we ventured further into the heart of Sri Lanka, the landscape revealed its majestic nature. We were astounded by seeing Pidurangala Rock, a 200-metre-high granite colossus just a kilometre north of Sigiriya. The short hike to Pidurangala Rock offered breathtaking views of Sigiriya and beyond. We climbed the steep steps and soon were rewarded with a breathtaking panoramic view of the surrounding landscape. It took us 30 minutes to climb. The sight took our breaths away and left us humbled in the presence of such grandeur. From the top are glorious vistas of the surrounding landscape and an incredible view of the majestic Sigiriya Rock. From there, Sigiriya Lion’s Rock is visible, standing alone. This was the place where demon king Ravana had his palace in the Treta Yuga. Believed to have been built 50 centuries ago, the palace is said to have had a unique lift for Ravana and his visitors. Ravana imprisoned Sita in one of the caves at the bottom of this humongous boulder. Sigiriya is a fifth-century fortress in Sri Lanka carved out of an inselberg, a hill of hard volcanic rock that soared high above the surrounding jungle. We spent two hours atop the rock, mainly taking photographs. We descended from Pidurangala Rock, filled with awe and a sense of accomplishment.The journey ahead seemed even more enticing as we ventured along the winding roads, heading towards our next destination.Cash-strapped Sri Lanka plunged into its worst financial crisis in more than seven decades in 2022, with a severe dollar shortage sending inflation soaring to a high of 70 percent, its currency to record lows, and its economy contracting 7.3 percent.Thanks to the growing number of tourists, Sri Lanka is now bouncing back.In Jetwing Lake, we met Kasun Pradeep Somasiri, a receptionist. He briefed us that the resort is now 50 percent occupied. “That’s a better figure now as we are recovering.”The travel and tourism sector is a significant income generator for Sri Lanka. However, the economic crisis, the Ukraine–Russia war, and China’s zero-Covid policy have jeopardised the industry.Tourism accounted for more than 12 percent of the country’s GDP in 2019 and was the third-largest source of foreign exchange reserves, behind worker remittances and the apparel industry.Sri Lanka was poised to be one of the world’s best holiday destinations due to its rich culture, wealth of natural resources, and diversity of accessible experiences.However, tourism-dependent Sri Lanka suffered its first major setback with the Easter bombings 2019. This led to the collapse of inbound tourism flows as international arrivals declined by 18 percent year-on-year, and tourist expenditure fell by 17.7 percent that year. This was immediately followed by two years of pandemic restrictions. Inbound visitors fell to just 116,600 in 2021.An acute balance of payments crisis forced Sri Lanka to preemptively default on foreign debt of over $50 billion in April 2022, triggering a crippling economic contraction with spiralling inflation.“Tourism is gaining momentum,” says Somasiri. “The British and Chinese have started to return to Sri Lanka.”January-August is the peak season for foreigners. “From December to April, local people travel for holiday purposes,” says Somasiri. Before we started the tour to other religious sites, our tour guide, Sampath Mayadunne, told us, “Don't take selfies with your back to Buddha.” Turning your back on a Buddha statue and some other religious sites to take photos and videos is a strict no-no.The most common sight across Sri Lanka is the tank cascades system, an ancient irrigation infrastructure. The system is a network of small tanks draining to large reservoirs that store rainwater and surface runoff for later use.“These infrastructures were built by its ancient kings over 2,000 years ago to solve the water scarcity in the country’s dry zone,” says Mayadunne.On day two, we travelled to Ranweli Spice Garden in Matale. This garden is famous for its rare spices and herbs. A tour of the gardens will show you the cultivation, harvesting, cleaning, and packaging process, as well as the health benefits and uses of the herbs.On the way, we saw a colourful Muthumariamman Hindu temple, boasting hundreds of detailed sculptures in a rich mosaic of colour.In Kandy, we visited the Temple of the Tooth Relic (Sri Dalada Maligawa), one of the most sacred places of worship in the Buddhist world. It was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1988.The temple sustained damage from bombings by Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna in 1989 and by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam in 1998. However, it was fully restored each time.We then headed to Jetwing St Andrew’s, a luxurious 5-star property in Sri Lanka’s hill country of Nuwara Eliya, situated at 1,900 metres above sea level. During our stay in Kandy, we immersed ourselves in the city's charm and the serenity of the countryside. On the third day, early morning, we travelled to Nuwara Eliya, the area famous for tea estates that give many Nepalis the feeling that they have come to Kanyam, Ilam, in eastern Nepal.We visited a tea factory called Damro Labookellie Tea Centre, the oldest tea centre in Sri Lanka. Due to its cold climate, it is the most important area for tea production in Sri Lanka.In this tea factory, they make white and black tea, while the green tea is processed in another tea factory and then sent to Damro.After the tea factory tour and the tea tasting, we headed to Galle, our next resting point.We encountered narrow, winding, and maze-like streets and alleys in Nuwara Eliya, known as ‘Little England’. The town has preserved almost all its British-era buildings and is calm and beautiful. On our way to Galle, at the roadside, our tour guide stopped us at the famed Sita temple, which has Hanuman's footprints and is the place where Sita, wife of Lord Rama, was held captive by the demon king Ravana after he abducted her from India.We were at Sita Eliya, a temple named Sri Seethai Amman.When we reached the Hindu temple, rich in vibrant colours and architectural elements, it was full of devotees. The water stream adjoining the temple is believed to be where Sita bathed. Large footprints are found on the stones in the stream, and there is a saying that those belong to Hanuman, who came spying to find Sita’s whereabouts.In Ella, Ravana’s waterfalls are significant in the Rama-Ravana story. The cascade charms visitors from all over the globe. The waterfall is easily accessible and is known to have hidden caves at the top, which are believed to have been used as Ravana's residence.The 25-metre-tall waterfall is a beautiful cascade that provides the perfect backdrop for a photo to remember your Ramayana trail adventures in Sri Lanka. A short pilgrimage tour ended there, and it was now time for an adventure. Though it was not part of our itinerary, our guide decided to tour us on a train ride.Though short, only six kilometres from Ella to Demodera, it was thrilling. Everyone screamed in unison like kids on a fair ride to hear the echoes in the dark every time we passed through the tunnels. The sound of the train is subtly different inside a tunnel. For the first-timer, the darkness and shouts inside the tunnels when the train passes would be scary, like a horror movie.The train we boarded wasn’t crowded, but people had already filled the doorway, ready for the scenic journey.With the shrill sound of a whistle, the train slowly pulled away from the platform at Ella, passing houses, coconut trees and green fields.As the train progressed, tourists and locals were leaning out the windows and crowding to hang out the doors. I joined the crowd and hung out on a train. A short excitement ended there.After lunch, we headed to Galle and reached Jetwing Lighthouse. As soon as our group entered the hotel, they shouted with excitement.The hotel is on a rocky outcrop three miles west of Galle. Waves crash over giant boulders in front of it and produce howling winds.We were at Galle’s 17th-century fort five minutes from the hotel on day four. In the Bay of Galle on the southwest coast of Sri Lanka, Galle Fort was built first in 1588 by the Portuguese and lavishly rebuilt by the Dutch during the 17th century. It is a historical, archaeological and architectural heritage monument that maintains a perfect appearance even after more than 436 years.We then reached Hikkaduwa Beach, a popular beach destination on the southern coast of Sri Lanka. On the way, we saw a 30-metre-high Big Buddha Statue. It is a replica of the 6th-century Buddhas of Bamiyan destroyed by the Taliban in Afghanistan. It was created using the earliest known sketches of the statue. It was built in remembrance of the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami victims.We then travelled through the 222-kilometre-long Southern Expressway, Sri Lanka's first expressway linking the capital, Colombo, with Galle, Matara, and Hambantota, significant cities south of the island.On day five, we reached Colombo, the capital of Sri Lanka. Jetwing Colombo Seven hosted us in the bustling capital. We took a city tour early morning and visited Bally's Casino at night.On day six, we returned to Kathmandu early in the morning on a Sri Lankan Airlines flight, the airline that organised the trip in coordination with Jetwing Hotels Limited, a Sri Lankan hotel chain.National flag carrier Nepal Airlines, in its previous avatar as Royal Nepal Airlines, used to operate direct flights to Colombo during the 1980s. However, the carrier suspended operations following an armed movement by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) in Sri Lanka. There had been no direct air links between the two countries for decades.In 2016, Himalaya Airlines started a chartered flight that lasted a few months due to low traffic movement between the two countries. Sri Lankan Airlines started operating direct flights to Kathmandu in August 2021.“The main objective of this media tour is to increase tourism in both countries for mutual benefit. We want to draw Nepalis for pilgrims and leisure activities,” says Nilina Pathirana, Country Manager at Srilankan Airlines in Nepal.“We have understood that Nepali travellers tend to travel to Bangkok, Vietnam, Malaysia, Dubai, and Maldives. Nepalis have quite minimal knowledge about Sri Lanka and the religious connection between Lanka and Nepal. We want to promote Nepal and Sri Lanka jointly. This will be a win-win business,” added Pathirana.The airline said it currently carries 60 percent of the passengers from Nepal to Sri Lanka and beyond destinations like Tokyo, Sydney, Melbourne, and other Middle Eastern destinations. The return airfare for a 3.5-hour-long flight starts at Rs74,000. “We have a four-night, five-day package that begins from Rs80,000, depending on the properties and extended itineraries,” says Pathirana.Nepalis must submit certain required documents for visa processing, like their passport copy and bank statement. Due to this government-to-government policy, only Nepalis must obtain a prior visa. Otherwise, Sri Lankans are required to have a visa upon arrival.“The other best thing is that Sri Lankan Airlines can be involved with the visa process or facilitate the Nepalis tourists. Our main intention is to have a sustainable market in Kathmandu and make it a daily flight,” says Pathirana. \nMundhum Trek in Koshi province in the eastern part of Nepal is a new cultural walking trail. It passes through several indigenous ethnic villages and landscapes in Khotang and Bhojpur districts. This trail goes up to an elevation of 4,200 metres to the viewpoint of Silchung Peak and takes one through the settlements of the Kirati people. This route starts from Diktel Bazaar and passes through beautiful settlements like Chakhewa, Rawa Dhap, Salpa Bhanjyang, Silchung and Hanspokhari before ending in Bhojpur. There are some hotels in Diktel but trekkers are advised to carry tents. The trail offers panoramic views of most of the eight-thousanders, including Everest, Lhotse, Makalu, Cho Oyu and Kanchenjunga mountains. The spring season, March through May, is highly recommended for the trek.Janaki Mandir Janaki Mandir at Janakpur in Madhesh province was constructed in 1874 and is a blend of Mughal and local architecture. The temple is a three-storey building and has 60 rooms, making it the largest temple in Nepal. Pilgrims flock here by the thousands to pay homage to Janaki Mandir—Janaki being the other name of Sita, the daughter of King Janak. The temple houses an idol of Sita which was found near Ayodhya, the kingdom of Ram. The marriage anniversary of Lord Ram and Sita is celebrated in Janakpur every year on Vivaha Panchami, which falls in December. In the southwest corner of Janaki Mandir is the Vivaha Mandap, which has been built at the site where the marriage of Ram and Sita is said to have taken place. Another well-known temple in the vicinity is Ram Mandir, which is built in pagoda style and is hence different from the other temples in Janakpur that generally bear resemblance to Mughal architecture. It houses a female statue, said to be of Yogamaya, which has the reputation of being one of the most beautiful images of female forms in Nepal. Other holy sites of interest include the Laxman Temple, Sankat Mochan Temple and Hanuman Temple.Kuri Village, Kalinchok Kuri village, a popular tourist destination around 150 km from Kathmandu, lies at an altitude of 3,842 metres above sea level in Kalinchowk of Dolakha district, in Bagmati province. People visit the place to enjoy the snow during the winter besides the mesmerising landscapes and splendid panoramic view of the Himalayan range. Kalinchok gets snow mainly at the end of December and the snowfall continues till the end of February or mid-March. When there is snow, it is difficult for jeeps, buses and cars to reach the top of Kuri village. Chains are wrapped around the wheels of vehicles and specially modified jeeps with highly experienced drivers are used to carry visitors. There are several hotels and restaurants in the area. The road up to Kuri has also improved over the years.Annapurna Base Camp Annapurna Base Camp trek, in Gandaki province, makes for a picturesque journey that takes you to the foothills of the Annapurna South, up to 4,130 metres above sea level. The five-day trek (seven days for slow walkers) offers rich cultural diversities, typical Nepali villages and the flora and fauna nestled at the foothills of Annapurna. The distance from Pokhara to Annapurna Base Camp is approximately 81 kilometres. It is among the shortest and most budget-friendly treks in Nepal. For Nepalis, lodging costs around $5 to $10 per day. For foreigners, the overall cost of the trek ranges from $800 to $1500 on average per person. Annapurna Base Camp trek can be done at any time throughout the year as each season offers a different trekking experience. The ideal time for the trek depends on your weather preferences and what you expect from it. However, autumn (September to October) and spring (March to May) are considered the two best seasons for the trek, as the days at the time are warm and bright with clear skies.Bardiya National Park Bardiya National Park, located in the southern Tarai belt of Lumbini province, is home to one of the most elusive and majestic animals on earth—the Royal Bengal Tiger. The park, which covers an area of 968 square kilometres, is considered one of the most important protected areas in the country. It is a prime destination for those looking to catch a glimpse of a tiger. A bit of luck and patience will offer a good chance to see the Bengal Tiger. The jungle safari also offers one the opportunity to spot Asian elephants and the greater one-horned rhinoceros. The rare Gangetic river dolphins are occasionally spotted on rafting trips along the Geruwa River, the eastern channel of the Karnali river. Besides, visitors can enjoy the homestays and explore local Tharu culture. The right time to visit the park is from mid-September to mid-December and mid-February to May.Khaptad National Park Khaptad National Park in Sudurpaschim province is a protected area in the far western region. It stretches over four districts of Bajhang, Bajura, Achham and Doti and ranges in elevation from 1,400 to 3,300 metres. The park can be visited throughout the year. Trekkers are advised to bring their tents, food and other supplies. The Nepal Tourism Board says of late, social media has been increasingly influencing Nepali travellers to go to Khaptad. Since the far-flung Khaptad National Park is still offbeat for many travellers, the area remains pristine and fresh. The seasons of spring (March-May) and autumn (October-November) are the ideal times to visit the park. The temperature ranges from 10°c to 20°c offering pleasant trekking weather. The monsoon begins in June and lasts until September and during this time, roads often become muddy and slippery. From December to February, winter brings snow and chilling winds to the park.Limi Valley \nOnce again, my heart swelled with joy when my hometown came into view.Arriving at Lalikharka after the treacherous journey through Pauwa Bhanjyang and the bustling Kanchhi Dokan, Phidim, the headquarters of Panchthar district, revealed itself like a surprise gift. My home town, Phidim, is unique in the fact that it reveals to travellers approaching it from uphill. As the vehicle descends the mountain road, it slowly comes into view, its houses and buildings recognisable for the native son.This Dashain, I undertook the much-awaited trip to my hometown with my wife Kabita and daughter Aarohi. Little did I anticipate the transformation that awaited me.The moment I got out of the jeep, I noticed that Phidim, nestled in the lush hills, has undergone a remarkable transformation over the years. As I guided my family to my home, which had suffered damages in the 1989 quake that struck eastern Nepal, I found that old, mud and stone houses had been replaced by concrete buildings. The place was vastly different from the one I remembered.Arriving at my childhood home felt like reuniting with an old friend. Navigating its nooks and crannies with my daughter, we delved into the history of the house, a symbol of my cherished memories.My wife had visited Phidim years ago, spending a month with my parents. She, too, recalled beautiful moments she had had in the town. I asked the tenant about the neighbours and acquaintances. Some had died, while others had left for good.A call to local journalist Giriraj Banskota led me to the school grounds, where memories flooded back. This was where I spent my teenage years, playing ball, learning to kick, and watching major tournaments. Here, I even encountered a group of Western climbers headed to Kanchenjunga, the world’s third-highest mountain. I remember being awed by their shiny yellow tents, headlights and strange smell. I remember practising my tutephuteko Angrezi with the climbers. Birendra Shield, an annual sports tournament named after the late king, brought ace players from various schools in Panchthar district. The district also hosted Yuba Mela, an annual three-day fair to commemorate the birthday of the king, organising football tournaments in which teams from as far as Sunsari and Taplejung participated. I never excelled at dribbling balls. A boy growing up in a seven-member family, I soon found my interest in literature. In the late 1980s, Phidim hosted a major literary festival. In the run-up to the 1990 pro-democracy protest, walls were painted with anti-monarchy slogans, local politicians were arrested. I took my family to my school, Naya Namuna Secondary School. It was Saturday, so the school was closed. I peeked through the steel gate and wall, imagining myself labouring over classes. Memories are hazy, but what I remember most is going out of the school—to quiz contests with me leading the school team, to essay competitions at the District Education Office and to play carom board, a national pastime, in a nearby shopfront. Returning to the main street, the demolition of a landmark gate made me reflect on how cities transform, shedding old landmarks for new identities. Navigating narrow alleyways, I felt like a stranger in my own hometown. Multistory buildings have emerged and roads have been paved, reshaping the town. It’s the same place with a different face, leaving me nostalgic for the Phidim of my memories.We finally reached Shivalaya temple, which I told my wife and daughter was one of my cherished hangouts. A giant statue of Falgunanda (the Kirant leader’s birthday is celebrated on November 10) stood before the steps to the temple. Though my wife suspected I came here to smoke, in reality, I visited the temple in the evening to meet friends and talk about issues that mattered most to us at the time. It also offered a panoramic view of the town (I could not take my family to Gadhi Danda, a hillock across the Shivalaya).Towards the end of my journey, I felt sad about Phidim’s lack of prospects. To my dismay, I found that people have been leaving the town in droves. Despite blacktopped roads and multi-story buildings, Phidim faces a troubling reality. The lack of quality higher education and specialist healthcare has driven people away, echoing the circumstances that led me to Kathmandu years ago. Conversations with locals confirmed a mass exodus from the town, a trend that raises concerns about Phidim's future.My conversations with familiar strangers led me to conclude that Phidim has transformed into a transit town for pilgrims heading to Pathibhara Devi Temple, which is around 255 kilometres north in Taplejung district. I met dozens of people headed to the holy site. While pilgrims see it as a stopover, for me, it was a homecoming. The realisation dawned that Phidim is, perhaps, in a state of transition, trading its rustic charm for the hallmarks of urbanisation. While I left Phidim for higher education in Kathmandu, people from rural areas have flocked to the town in search of better opportunities, bringing life and energy to the once quiet community.As we bid adieu to my hometown, I couldn’t help but reflect on the inevitability of leaving a place, no matter how enamoured one is with it. Passing Kanchhi Dokan, I pointed out Kanchnajungha and Kumbhakarna to my daughter—symbols of my childhood. Phidim, now a blend of nostalgia and change, remains etched in my heart, a testament to the intricate dance between memory and evolution. \nNewcastle United’s Anthony Gordon equalised 14 minutes from time to secure a 1-1 draw at Bournemouth in the Premier League on Sunday and spoil their hosts’ 125th anniversary celebrations.Marcus Tavernier put Bournemouth ahead in the first half but Gordon stole in at the back post to steer home a 76th-minute cross from substitute Harvey Barnes to ensure a deserved share of the spoils.Newcastle advanced to four points from their opening two games of the season. Bournemouth drew their first match at Nottingham Forest.Bournemouth, hoping for a win to mark their anniversary festivities, had the ball in the net in stoppage time for what looked initially to be a dramatic late winner but Dango Ouattara’s effort was ruled out for handball after a VAR check.Ouattara rose powerfully but a check showed the ball hit him on the top of his arm as he went up for the header and it was disallowed to the frustration of the home fans.It was Newcastle who looked more likely to snatch a winner, however, with Bournemouth goalkeeper Neto making several key stops to deny Alexander Isak, Joelinton and a header from centre-back Dan Burn in the closing stages.Bournemouth’s lead came after Antoine Semenyo had stolen possession from Joelinton and worked the ball past three defenders before setting up a tap-in for Tavernier.Joelinton was caught midway in his own half by the Bournemouth winger, who looked to have taken on too much as he stormed in at goal but managed to get a square pass to Tavernier when surrounded by three defenders.Semenyo, who struck the crossbar in the first half, was close to another assist in the 64th minute but his pass from the wing was miscued by a sliding Evanilson at the back post.Bournemouth’s record signing was making his debut in one of five changes from last week’s line-up but Evanilson’s two other efforts on goal were easily dealt with by home goalkeeper Nick Pope and he was taken off after 72 minutes.Madueke hits hat-trick as Chelsea thrash Wolves 6-2 Noni Madueke silenced the boos with a second-half hat-trick all assisted by Cole Palmer as Chelsea crushed Wolverhampton Wanderers 6-2 away in a frenetic Premier League clash at Molineux on Sunday.Chelsea’s first Premier League points of the season and the first for new manager Enzo Maresca arrived in spectacular fashion as the visitors ripped Wolves apart after the break following an absorbing first period.Maresca’s side led twice in the first half with goals by Nicolas Jackson and Palmer but both times Wolves deservedly hit back through Matheus Cunha and Jorgen Strand Larsen.Wolves fell apart after the break, however, and Madueke took the game beyond them with three goals in 15 minutes.Joao Felix came off the bench to mark his return to the club with his side’s sixth goal.Much has been made of Chelsea’s huge squad assembled at massive cost and the baffling puzzle Italian Maresca has been hired to solve, but the youthful side he sent out on Sunday including nine players aged 23 or under gelled impressively.Madueke was the villain for the home fans in more ways than one. The English forward was booed from the start after a deleted social media post in which he insulted the city of Wolverhampton.He silenced the hecklers in emphatic fashion, however, to get Chelsea’s league campaign up and running after their opening defeat by champions Manchester City.With Wolves in disarray, Pedro Neto, who left them for Chelsea in the summer, teed up Felix for a cool finish.Slot off to winning start at home as Liverpool cruise past Brentford Arne Slot’s comfortable start to life as Liverpool manager continued when his new side strolled to a 2-0 victory over Brentford in the Premier League on Sunday.Liverpool dominated early on, scoring a fine opening goal on the counterattack when Luis Diaz arrowed his first of the season into the top corner with 13 minutes on the clock.Brentford responded well, going close with two short-range headers either side of halftime, but Mohamed Salah ended the visitors’ hopes of taking anything from their trip to Anfield with a second goal 20 minutes from time.Dutchman Slot now has two 2-0 wins from two games as he undertakes the difficult task of replacing Juergen Klopp as Liverpool boss, with a testing trip to Manchester United up next.“The time with Juergen (was) amazing and the time with the new boss is a joy and he has a certain way of playing,” Liverpool captain Virgil van Dijk told Sky Sports.Before Sunday, no Liverpool boss since Graeme Souness in 1991 had secured wins in their two opening league games in charge.Brentford, without star striker Ivan Toney in the squad again as speculation over his future continues, grew into the contest, but could not make a sustained spell of pressure before halftime count.Liverpool upped the ante after the break and deservedly got their second goal, with Salah adding to his strike on the opening day at Ipswich Town with another well-taken shot to seal the victory.Salah is now Liverpool’s outright fifth top scorer at Anfield in all competitions with 118 goals, moving ahead of Robbie Fowler as he again looks primed to be front and centre of a Red title tilt. \nNepal stormed into the final of the SAFF U-20 Championship after they defeated ten-man Bhutan 4-1 on penalties following a 1-1 draw at the ANFA Complex in Lalitpur on Sunday.Nepal goalkeeper Jiyarat Shekh was the hero of the shootout. He stopped penalties from Jigme Namgyel and Ugyen Dorji and scored the decisive penalty kick, sending Nepal into their third final of the competition.Nepal will face defending champions India or Bangladesh, who meet in the second semi-final clash on Monday, in the title match on Wednesday.The defeat also ended Bhutan’s hopes of reaching their first ever final of the SAFF age-group competition. They reached the semi-finals in 2017, 2019 and 2023.Bhutan were a better side and kept Nepal under pressure most of the first half but could not create any clear chance at goal.Nepal were also lacklustre before the break and could not really threaten the Bhutan post.But the game suddenly burst into life eleven minutes into the second half, when Jetsuen Dorji intercepted a poor pass from Semanta Thapa and launched a thunderstrike from outside the edge of the penalty area. Nepal goalie Shekh was completely aware of the incoming shot and could have done better but let the ball slip with his misguided effort.Nepal immediately felt a sense of urgency after conceding and their constant pressure on the opponents was rewarded with two freekicks from dangerous range after 70 minutes.Abinash Syangtan failed to convert both freekicks but his first attempt was a further warning of what Nepal could do as Bhutan’s goalkeeper Lhocho Nima had to work really hard to keep the shot away.Nepal continued to apply pressure and it earned them their first reward as Kinzang Tenzin was sent off for a second yellow after harshly challenging Sabin Ghimire in the middle of the pitch.Tenzin’s departure proved costly for Bhutan as Nepal equalised only six seconds after the match resumed.Semanta tossed the resulting freekick for Lachhu Thapa, who sent a long ball into the six yard box for Dhami to head home with an incredible back-header.Samir Tamang almost put the game to bed in the 90th minute but his header off a long pass from Ram Thapa missed the goal by inches.Bhutan had a golden opportunity to shock Nepal in the fifth minute of injury time when Semanta’s poor attempt to clear the ball fell straight to the path of Namgyel. But the midfielder could not capitalise on the chance from near the spot kick, as the game went to tiebreaker. \nNepal Volleyball Association on Saturday awarded cash prizes to the four volleyball teams who won medals at various Central Asian Volleyball Association (CAVA) tournaments.The association honoured the team members of gold and silver medallists of CAVA Beach Volleyball, silver medallists of CAVA Women’s Volleyball Nations League and bronze medallists of CAVA U-20 Women’s Volleyball Championship amid a function in Kathmandu.The players of the national women’s volleyball team who won silver medal at the CAVA Women’s Volleyball Nations League in Kathmandu earlier this month were rewarded with Rs102,000 each. Captain Aruna Shahi’s team had also made history by defeating India for the first time in their volleyball history during the group stage of the tournament. However, their hopes to win a first major trophy at home remained unfulfilled after they lost to the Indians in the final. Women’s volleyball head coach Jagadhish Bhatta also bagged Rs102,000, while assistant coach Bharat Yadav received Rs92,000. Physio Lokendra Kunwar and manager Nilam Bajracharya got Rs82,000 each.Kamala Pun and Manisha Chaudhary were provided with Rs60,000 each for winning the gold medal at the CAVA Beach Volleyball in Bhutan.Man Bahadur Shrestha and Dil Bahadur Sunar’s pair, who won silver in beach volleyball in Bhutan, were honoured with Rs30,000 each.

His unbeaten 67 (84) had guided Nepal to a seven-wicket victory against the United Arab Emirates in the Premier Cup final. Jha was also an important part of the Nepal squad at ICC U-19 World Cup and T20 World Cup. Footballer Rai has established herself as one of the most important players of the national women’s football team. Her stoppage time goal against Lebanon guided Nepal to the final of the WAFF Women’s Championship last year.Manmati Bista was a part of the Nepal national women’s kabaddi team who won a bronze medal at the 19th Asian Games in Hangzhou, China.Volleyball player Bhatta is a regular at the national team. She was in the squad that secured a silver medal at the CAVA Women’s Volleyball Nations League this month.Rugby’s Shrestha led Bagmati Province to the championship during the National Games. He also represented Nepal in the rugby competition at the 19th Asian Games. \nHezbollah launched hundreds of rockets and drones at Israel early on Sunday, as Israel’s military said it struck Lebanon with around 100 jets to thwart a larger attack, in one of the biggest clashes in more than 10 months of border warfare.Missiles were visible curling up through the dawn sky, dark vapour trails behind them, as an air raid siren sounded in Israel and a distant blast lit the horizon, while smoke rose over houses in Khiam in southern Lebanon.On Sunday evening, sirens sounded in Rishon Letsiyon, central Israel, the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) said, and added that one projectile had been identified crossing from the southern Gaza Strip and falling in an open area. The armed wing of Hamas said it had fired an “M90” rocket at Tel Aviv.Any major spillover in the fighting, which began in parallel with the war in Gaza, risks morphing into a regional conflagration drawing in Hezbollah’s backer Iran and Israel’s main ally, the United States.With three deaths confirmed in Lebanon and one in Israel, both sides indicated they were happy to avoid further escalation for now, but warned that there could be more strikes to come.Hezbollah leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah said the Iranian-backed group’s barrage, a reprisal for the assassination of senior commander Fuad Shukr last month, had been completed “as planned”.However, the group would assess the impact of its strikes and “if the result is not enough, then we retain the right to respond another time”, he said.Israel’s foreign minister said the country did not seek a full-scale war, but Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu warned: “This is not the end of the story.”Earlier, Netanyahu had said: “We are determined to do everything we can to defend our country ... whoever harms us - we harm him”.The two sides have exchanged messages that neither wants to escalate further, with the main gist being that the exchange was “done”, two diplomats told Reuters.Expectations of an escalation had risen since a missile strike in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights last month killed 12 youths and the Israeli military assassinated Shukr in Beirut in response.Hezbollah had delayed its retaliation to give time for ceasefire talks, and had calibrated its attack to avoid triggering a full-scale war, a Hezbollah official said.US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin ordered the presence of two aircraft carrier strike groups in the Middle East, bolstering the US military presence. Earlier, top US General C.Q. Brown arrived in Israel for talks with military leaders.Meanwhile in Gaza, the Israeli offensive continued, with air strikes killing at least five Palestinians in Gaza City early on Monday, according to the official Palestinian news agency Wafa.There was no agreement in the Gaza ceasefire talks that took place in Cairo, with neither Hamas nor Israel agreeing to several compromises presented by mediators, although a senior US official, described the talks as “constructive” and said the process would continue in the coming days.DENSE BOMBARDMENTIsrael’s air strikes started before Hezbollah began its barrage, Nasrallah said. Netanyahu said these “pre-emptive” strikes had foiled a much larger Hezbollah barrage but Nasrallah said they had had little impact.Hezbollah’s own rocket and drone strikes were focused on an intelligence base near Tel Aviv, Nasrallah said. Netanyahu said all the drones targeting what he called a strategic location in central Israel were intercepted.A security source in Lebanon said at least 40 Israeli strikes had hit various towns in the country’s south in one of the densest bombardments since hostilities began in October.Hezbollah said the strikes killed two of its fighters in al-Tiri. The Hezbollah-allied Shi’ite Muslim group Amal said a strike on Khiam killed one of its fighters.Israel’s military said a naval soldier was killed and two wounded.Lebanon’s caretaker prime minister, Najib Mikati, met cabinet ministers at a session of the national emergency committee.Flights to and from Ben Gurion airport in Tel Aviv were suspended for around 90 minutes. Some flights to and from Beirut were also halted, stranding passengers.WARNING SIRENSIn northern Israel, warning sirens sounded and explosions were heard in several areas as Israel’s Iron Dome aerial defence system shot down rockets coming from southern Lebanon.“Israel should, as it did this morning, deliver a pre-emptive strike. But if Hezbollah continues, Israel should strike very hard to remove the threat from Hezbollah once and for all,” said Yuval Peleg, 73, from Haifa.A resident of the southern Lebanese town of Zibqeen told Reuters he had awakened “to the sound of planes and the loud explosions of rockets - even before the dawn prayer. It felt like the apocalypse.”The White House said US President Joe Biden was following events. “We will keep supporting Israel’s right to defend itself, and we will keep working for regional stability,” National Security Council spokesperson Sean Savett said.United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres was “deeply concerned” by the escalation between Israel and Hezbollah and called on both parties to immediately return to a cessation of hostilities, his spokesperson said.Egypt and Jordan also warned against escalation.The United States was not involved in Israel’s strikes on Sunday, but provided some intelligence about incoming Hezbollah attacks, a US official said.Hezbollah fired missiles at Israel immediately after the Oct. 7 attacks by Hamas gunmen on Israel. Hezbollah and Israel have been exchanging fire constantly ever since, while avoiding a major escalation as war rages in Gaza to the south.That precarious balance appeared to shift after the strike in the Golan Heights, for which Hezbollah denied responsibility, and the subsequent assassination of Shukr, one of Hezbollah’s most senior military commanders.Shukr’s death in an air strike was quickly followed by the assassination of Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran, which led to vows of reprisals against Israel by Iran. \nThirteen people were killed and two injured in Indonesia's North Maluku province on Sunday after floods in the east of the sprawling archipelago, authorities said.The country's disaster management agency BNPB said the floods, caused by heavy rain since Saturday, also badly damaged 10 houses in Ternate city.Citing forecasts that heavy rain may continue in the next few days, BNPB warned residents to be on guard.\"We urge people to remain vigilant and follow directions from authorities on potential subsequent floods,\" spokesperson Abdul Muhari said in a statement.BNPB said it has deployed a team to help evacuate the victims. Search and rescue agency Basarnas also said that efforts to evacuate victims, who were hit by landslides and debris swept along by floodwaters, were ongoing.In May, flash floods and mudslides in Indonesia's West Sumatra province killed more than 60 people. \nPavel Durov, the Russian-French billionaire founder and CEO of the Telegram messaging app, was arrested at Bourget airport outside Paris on Saturday evening, TF1 TV and BFM TV said, citing unidentified sources.Durov was travelling aboard his private jet, TF1 said on its website, adding he had been targeted by an arrest warrant in France as part of a preliminary police investigation.TF1 and BFM both said the investigation was focused on a lack of moderators on Telegram, and that police considered that this situation allowed criminal activity to go on undeterred on the messaging app.Durov faces possible indictment on Sunday, according to French media.The encrypted Telegram, with close to one billion users, is particularly influential in Russia, Ukraine and the republics of the former Soviet Union. It is ranked as one of the major social media platforms after Facebook, YouTube, WhatsApp, Instagram, TikTok and Wechat.Telegram did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment. The French Interior Ministry and police had no comment.Russian-born Durov founded Telegram with his brother in 2013. He left Russia in 2014 after refusing to comply with government demands to shut down opposition communities on his VKontakte social media platform, which he sold.\"I would rather be free than to take orders from anyone,\" Durov told U.S. journalist Tucker Carlson in April about his exit from Russia and search for a home for his company which included stints in Berlin, London, Singapore and San Francisco.After Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Telegram has become the main source of unfiltered - and sometimes graphic and misleading - content from both sides about the war and the politics surrounding the conflict.The platform has become what some analysts call ‘a virtual battlefield’ for the war, used heavily by Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskiy and his officials, as well as the Russian government.Telegram – which allows users to evade official scrutiny - has also become one of the few places where Russians can access independent news about the war after the Kremlin increased curbs on independent media following its invasion of Ukraine.The Russian foreign ministry said its embassy in Paris was clarifying the situation around Durov and called on Western non-governmental organisations to demand his release.Russia began blocking Telegram in 2018 after the app refused to comply with a court order to grant state security services access to its users’ encrypted messages.The action interrupted many third-party services, but had little effect on the availability of Telegram there. The ban order, however, sparked mass protests in Moscow and criticism from NGOs.‘Neutral platform’TF1 said Dubai-based Durov had been travelling from Azerbaijan and was arrested at around 8 p.m. (1800 GMT).Durov, whose fortune was estimated by Forbes at $15.5 billion, said some governments had sought to pressure him but the app should remain a \"neutral platform\" and not a \"player in geopolitics\".Telegram’s increasing popularity, however, has prompted scrutiny from several countries in Europe, including France, on security and data breach concerns.Russia’s representative to international organisations in Vienna, Mikhail Ulyanov, and several other Russian politicians were quick on Sunday to accuse France of acting as a dictatorship - the same criticism that Moscow faced when putting demands on Durov in 2014 and trying to ban Telegram in 2018.\"Some naive persons still don’t understand that if they play more or less visible role in international information space it is not safe for them to visit countries which move towards much more totalitarian societies,\" Ulyanov wrote on X.Elon Musk, billionaire owner of X, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter, said after reports of Durov’s detention: \"It’s 2030 in Europe and you’re being executed for liking a meme.\"Robert F. Kennedy Jr, who on Friday abandoned his U.S. presidential campaign and endorsed Republican Donald Trump, said on X after the reports that the need to protect free speech, \"has never been more urgent.\"Several Russian bloggers called for protests at French embassies throughout the world at noon on Sunday. \nIn 2008 Matina Shakya was only three years old when she was appointed as the Kumari of Kathmandu. She was succeeded by Trishna Shakya as the new Kumari in 2017.Kumaris are revered as goddesses of beauty and strength in certain Hindu and Buddhist traditions. Worshipping young girls as Kumaris is a 2,000-year-old practice in Nepal. Since the 13th century, when the Malla kings ruled, the Newars of the Kathmandu Valley have been worshipping Kumari, a girl from the Shakya/Bajracharya community chosen to embody the divine energy of goddess Taleju Bhawani. The reign of a Kumari ends when she starts menstruating. So long as she is serving as the Kumari, she is believed to be the nation’s divine protector, safeguarding it from evil. Matina, 18, is now in her first year of college, studying for a bachelor’s degree in management. Her father, Pratapman Shakya, when asked about having a daughter who is the only living the goddess in the world said, “Not having your own daughter live in the same house as you seemed a little unfair, but we feel very proud to call ourselves the parents of the royal Kumari who is revered by people all over the world.”On March 9, 2023, he, along with Matina, were getting ready for a special function held to honour all former Kumaris from across Nepal. “There are often events to honour Matina as she was the royal Kumari, but this one was dedicated to all former Kumaris from different areas. There are 129 living Kumaris in all,” he added. Besides Kathmandu, Kumari tradition is followed in Bhaktapur, Lalitpur, and Kirtipur, among other cities.According to him, this was the first time an event like this was organised and the Deputy Mayor of Kathmandu, Sunita Dangol, was also in attendance.Throughout the year, many people line up outside the ‘Kumari Ghar’ to get a chance to visit the Kumari and get her blessings. Many foreigners stand out in the yard to catch a glimpse of her. Nepali people believe that if a Kumari smiles at you, it is a bad omen.Everyday, a tutor visits the Kumari to help her continue with her education as she is not allowed to step outside the Kumari Ghar. She takes her exams and does her homework from the Kumari Ghar itself. She also has the freedom to play inside the Kumari Ghar. Many former kumaris have pursued careers in their fields of interest or studied after their term ends, and they continue to be treated with the same respect. The tradition of Kumari has evolved over time. In the past Kumaris did not enjoy these freedoms.Because of various superstitious beliefs, Kumaris were not fully educated and were forbidden from getting married because of the belief that the groom would die soon if he married an ex-Kumari. They led secluded lives, were restricted from participating in normal childhood activities, and focused solely on their religious duties.However, now, these myths have been dispelled. Modern understanding has shifted to recognise that Kumaris, after stepping down from their divine role, have the freedom to marry and lead a normal life. The perception of Kumaris as isolated figures has evolved, with a focus on providing them with a more balanced upbringing. There have been initiatives to integrate Kumaris into regular social and educational settings, allowing them to have a more holistic and fulfilling childhood experience. “Matina was already familiar with the students from the school that she attended after her term as Kumari ended,” said Shakya. “The kids visited the Kumari Ghar frequently so that she could have a smooth transition,” he added. According to Gautam Prasad Shakya, who has been living as a caretaker in the Kumari Ghar, the changes made to the tradition are minor. “The traditions of Kumari have mostly stayed the same. All the rituals are still practised like in the old days,” he said.On 6 May 2005, Pun Devi Maharjan, a lawyer, filed a case in the Supreme Court claiming that the traditional practice of electing young girls as Kumaris, or “goddesses’, who are expected to follow certain social restrictions and appear at religious festivals, violated the rights of the child. Quoting Maharjan’s complaint, Puskar Mathema writes in Yuwamanch Monthly of October 2007, “If Kumari tradition is continued, it will undermine the fundamental rights as well the freedoms of children guaranteed by the constitution and child rights treaties. Apart from this, it will have a negative impact on their physical and mental development.”The case continued while Nepal overthrew the monarchy and declared itself a secular state in 2007. When the judgement was pronounced in 2008, the goddess was still in her role, now giving blessings to the country’s President. The court ordered that the Kumaris and ex-Kumaris receive better benefits and arrangements and ordered the government to improve their support and allowances.In April 2006, Prof Chunda Bajracharya filed a petition at the Supreme Court against Maharjan’s petition, who had argued against the Kumari tradition. Bajracharya contended that the tradition should be preserved as heritage due to its over 100 years of history.“People who don’t understand the culture shouldn’t comment on it,” she stated. Bajracharya also criticised the human right activists who contended that Kumaris were only allowed to wear the colour red. “People who say Kumaris are forced to wear red clothing all the time, are the same people who send their kids to schools in uniform,” she said.“After the 2008 court verdict, there have been a lot of improvements. Now, a teacher visits the Kumari Ghar daily to tutor the Kumari, who is expected to complete school assignments and sit periodic exams. All the former Kumaris now get benefits like scholarships and special pensions,” she added.Bajracharya is currently a professor of literature at the Tribhuvan University in Kathmandu.“The only significant change that the court verdict brought to the tradition was in terms of her education,” said Gautam Prasad Shakya, the caretaker. “Kumaris were tutored long before the case, but the case helped formalise this arrangement. After the court verdict, the time between 12 pm and 4 pm was designated as the Kumari’s tuition time,” he added.After the verdict, there was a concerted effort to provide Kumaris with access to quality education, enabling them to develop the skills and knowledge needed to lead fulfilling lives beyond their divine roles. There was also a shift towards ensuring that the Kumari's living quarters are comfortable, safe, and conducive to her overall well-being.Moreover, the selection process for the Kumari underwent reforms in the aftermath of the Pun Devi Maharjan case. There was a push for greater transparency, accountability, and inclusivity in the selection of the Kumari, with an emphasis on ensuring that the process was fair, respectful, and free from undue influence.Efforts were made to support their transition into adulthood, including providing them with comprehensive resources for education, vocation, and social integration. This shift aimed to address the challenges faced by former Kumaris and empower them to lead independent and fulfilling lives after their divine service.“The Kumari tradition has evolved over time. During the tenure of my daughter, we saw a lot of improvements. Even after her time as Kumari, Matina continued to get a lot of government support,” said Shakya, former Kumari Matina’s father.“Some people argue that child rights are being violated, but all of her rights are being upheld inside the Kumari Ghar. This is a unique and respected aspect of Nepali culture, and I don’t believe it violates any of my child’s rights.”While the Kumari tradition continues, its practices have evolved. “She enjoys this normal life and it didn’t take her long to adjust as well,” says Matina’s father, on her transition from the revered Kumari to the ordinary Matina. \nWhat animals did Juddha Shumsher have in his zoo?“We only have records of animals from the mid-1960s,” says Ganesh Koirala, who has been employed at the Central Zoo for the past 36 years and currently serves as its information officer and programme officer. “That too I hand-copied from an old torn-down file that I came across.”Today, the Central Zoo, which sprawls across six hectares in Jawalakhel, Lalitpur, houses as many as 1,298 wild animals of different species of mammals, reptiles, fishes and birds from Nepal and around the world—from tiger, rhinoceros, hippopotamus and red panda to its recent attraction: a pair of chimpanzees.After enduring decades of neglect under various government bodies, with its animals and infrastructure scraping along in a deplorable state, the zoo received a new lease of life with improved infrastructure and animal care in 1995, when it came under the management of the King Mahendra Trust for Nature Conservation (KMTNC), now known as the National Trust for Nature Conservation, in 1995.Today, the Central Zoo is an entertainment venue, one of the most happening places in the Kathmandu valley. Flocked by thousands of daily visitors, the zoo now also hosts rescued animals and those in need of rehabilitation. It is also a site for conservation education.But when Juddha Shumsher Rana (prime minister from 1932–1945) built the Jawalakhel Zoological Garden on the premises of his Jawalakhel Durbar (where Nepal Administrative Staff College stands today) in 1932, he did so purely for private interests—as a space of entertainment and amusement for him and his family.Built in the semi-wilderness of Jawalakhel around a historical pond dating to the 17th century during the reign of King Siddhi Narsingh Malla, the zoo also became the space he could use to show his respect for two women he revered, his mother and sister-in-law, and indulge in one of his favourite pastimes—gambling.Today, the Central Zoo, nestled in the heart of Jawalakhel's sprawling crowd, does not go unnoticed, and its story is well told. But what passions drove Juddha to build the zoo? What was its original layout? What animals did it have in the beginning? And how did Juddha spend time there?“I remember once seeing a small board that read ‘Jawalakhel Zoological Garden’,” Koirala says. “I don’t know whether it was from Juddha’s time or was made in the later years. It must surely be that Juddha built the zoo out of influence from the British given how this term was used by them.”Koirala adds, “There is a former employee, now an elderly gentleman who worked in the zoo in the 1960s. He surely has some stories from Juddha’s time.”Birds, beasts and palacesTo trace the birth of Jawalakhel Zoological Garden, one has to look at the history of Nepal’s rulers owning birds and animals.Like rulers around the world, Nepal’s royalty kept wild and exotic birds and animals in captivity as a source of pleasure and mark of wealth and power. The book ‘Social History of Nepal’ by historians TR Vaidya, Tri Ratna Manandhar and Shankar Lal Joshi details how Mallas during the mediaeval Kathmandu Valley to Ranas and Shahs in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries owned rare, exotic creatures. In 1708, a rhinoceros in Kathmandu Valley broke the iron chain in which it was bound and killed its tamer. In 1714, Bhaktapur’s King Bhupatindra Malla gifted a camel and an elephant to Kantipur’s King Bhaskar Malla to build peace.Among Shahs, King Rana Bahadur Shah in particular was reputed for his collection of birds and animals. He also owned a zoo outside his palace in Basantapur Durbar Square, where the Nepal Bank Limited stands in New Road today. The zoo contained “tiger, bear, monkey, elephant, horse, deer… heron, peacock… pigeon, wild dogs, rabbits, rats, mongoose.”Jung Bahadur Rana’s zoo on the premises of his Thapathali Durbar hosted a variety of birds and animals collected during his hunting expeditions as well as those brought from abroad. Jung Bahadur himself used to “supervise and inspect it”. Juddha Shumsher likewise had his own collection of creatures which steadily expanded into a zoological garden. Seeking wilderness in his Jawalakhel DurbarJuddha’s biographer Ishwari Prasad writes in ‘The Life and Times of Maharaja Juddha Shumsher Jung Bahadur Rana’ that between 1933 and 1940, Juddha shot 433 tigers, 33 rhinoceros and 93 leopards. An insatiable big-game hunter, Juddha had a deep fondness for being in the wild and among wild animals, and from this came, according to oral history prevalent among members of Kathmandu’s Rana community including Juddha’s descendants, the desire to own a zoo.Built in 1752, Schönbrunn Zoo in Vienna, the world’s first modern zoo, was already over 100 years old when Juddha was born in 1875. London Zoo opened in 1828 and Alipore Zoological Garden (Kolkata Zoo) in 1875. Nawab Wajid Ali Shah Zoological Garden (Lucknow Zoo) was established in 1921. Juddha’s inspiration, his descendants say, was most likely reinforced by his tours to zoological gardens during his visits to England in 1908 and to different Indian cities.An article titled ‘Central zoo in state of neglect’ published in The Kathmandu Post in 1996 says that Juddha one day “received a pair of leopards as a gift”, cementing his desire to own a zoo. A report ‘Central Zoo Master Plan’ prepared by the KMTNC in 1996 says that Juddha decided to build a zoo in an epiphany when he saw that some animals “including deer, a few rhinos, and some tigers had been collected from the Tarai and kept in Kathmandu” could be put into one compound in the “lonely piece of land with a large 16th [sic] century Malla period Pokhari”.The pond lay still and serene surrounded by green wilderness ever since Patan’s King Siddhi Narsingh Malla built it in the 1600s. On the grounds surrounding this pond, the Newars from Na:Tole, Pulchowk and surroundings had their devisthans where, for centuries, they gathered to perform their religious ceremonies during Basanta Panchami and Bhoto Jatra even after this area fell within the Jawalakhel Durbar.For the palace, the ground served as its extended garden along with a horse and elephant stable. Subodh Rana, 69, grandson of Juddha Shumsher, recalled his father Kiran Shumsher telling him that Juddha and his family sometimes also used the scenic grounds for picnics. If there was any spot where Juddha wanted to build a menagerie, it would be around this Pokhari (pond). One day, he called his grandson General Maheshwar Shumsher Rana and deputed him to the task of doing just this.The zoo’s layout—except for the small plots of lands acquired later—that was in place when it came under KMTNC's management was, the present and retired zoo officials believe, mostly the same as it was built by Maheshwar and so offers a peek into how Juddha’s zoo must have been like. Pond in the middle of the ground surrounded by enclosures—the southern bank housing mainly larger animals, and cages for birds positioned on the northern banks.From pigeons to the king of the jungleWhat animals and birds did the enclosures at Juddha’s zoo house?“We cannot tell for sure,” Koirala says.Once it came under government ownership, the zoo was tossed from one institution to the other for lack of interest and knowledge on the right institution to manage it. Amid all this chaos, documents were possibly lost and the zoo has no concrete record about the animals that Juddha must have once taken amusement at, said Koirala.Mukti Narayan Shrestha, 82, a retired secretary of the Nepal government, joined the Central Zoo in 1970 as a veterinarian when many original structures of the zoo were still intact. Shrestha also worked with an elderly khardar who, he says, was employed in the zoo since the time of Juddha and was about to retire when he joined.“In those days where the purpose of menageries was exclusively for exhibition and pleasure with no regard for the welfare and recreation of animals and birds, the cages were tiny and iron-barred,” Shrestha says.Elephant, horses, deer, monkeys, tiger, rhinoceros, clouded leopard, red panda, bear, palm civet (nir biralo), four-horned antelope, Himalayan goral, pheasants, Himalayan monal—from the mythical and the majestic, the gentle and friendly to the fiery and ferocious, Juddha’s zoo boasted them all, Shrestha says.Shrestha’s account is not different from the anecdotes passed down to other retired and present zoo officials and the members of the Rana community, who also detail the rare and the exotic fauna, like the gharial crocodile and porcupine, even the jungle’s king—creatures, they say, that Juddha must have received from foreigners as gifts—appearing alongside domestic birds like pigeons.Tidbits of published information also confirm that the zoo had a good collection of exotic birds and animals from Nepal and abroad. One such suggestion comes from Kalyan Shumsher’s ‘Shree Teen Juddha Mahima’ published during Juddha’s reign in 1943.“One need not travel abroad to see the incredible birds and animals found in foreign countries,” he writes. “It will suffice to see [those creatures] right here in the zoo opened by His Holiness Shree 3 [Juddha] in Jawalakhel.”Among these incredible creatures, one reigned supreme—lion, the king of the jungle.For one, it would not have satiated Juddha to build a zoo and not have the jungle’s king exhibited in it. Juddha hence must have done everything possible to ensure one for the zoo. Infrastructure at the zoo suggests that the lion indeed lived at Juddha’s zoo or, in the least, during the Rana regime.“Where bear habitat lies today, there were two dome-shaped attached enclosures with a holding room, constructed in the classic architecture that many enclosures in the British zoos had in the past. They had brick walls and lime plaster,” Koirala says. “These were built to house a lion in one cage and a tiger in the other.”Near these enclosures stood another cage that remains intact today, with the head of a roaring lion carved out of the wall on the top of its iron bars. Zoo officials as well as members of the Rana community believe that Juddha had this exhibit built to specifically house a lion.Remarkably, these Juddha-era infrastructural spaces are corroborated by a rare piece of photographic evidence. A 1946 photo of the zoo shows a lion while a Kathmandu mother and her sons stand in front of its cage.Juddha’s place of piety and playThe zoo was not merely a space that Juddha sought out for amusement and retreat in the outpost of his palace; he also used this place to express his deepest affection.This affection spills right at the zoo’s entrance, in the form of the life-size statue of Karma Kumari Devi, wife of Juddha’s elder brother and Rana Prime Minister Dev Shumsher. Karma Kumari stands tall in her regal costume shaded by a wide canopy. Juddha revered Karma Kumari because it was she who raised him and looked after his mother Juhar Kumari Devi after the death of his father Dhir Shumsher. On another prominent part of the zoo on the south-east, Juhar Kumari’s enthroned statue overlooks the pond. Juddha had commissioned the London-based sculptor Domenico Antonio Tonelli to cast these statues.When Karma Kumari’s statue was unveiled is not clear, but Juhar Kumari’s statue was unveiled by Juddha amid a grand function in 1935 on Jawalakhel’s most auspicious day, Bhoto Jatra. It was attended by the British Resident Frederick Bailey.“On June 28, 1935, at Jawalakhel Durbar… the pond nearby looked very scenic,” says a Gorkhapatra news report titled ‘Statue installation’ dated July 5, 1935. “Because it was the day of Bhoto Jatra of Machhindranath… and moreover since an ideal woman’s statue was being unveiled, there was a crowd of lakhs of people.”Less than fifty metres from Karma Kumari’s statue stands a one-story building with a pagoda roof that today serves as the zoo’s meeting hall. Juddha, an avid gambler, found the scenic semi-wilderness covered in trees and filled with the sounds of wildlife to be a perfect place to relish the game. So he built a building with twelve doors on its four sides allowing him and his fellow gambling compatriots the freedom to enter through a particular door that they thought would bring luck. He called it his Juwa Ghar, the gambling house, and built it with the sole purpose of indulging in the game he loved. Roar of lion reverberates in KathmanduThe sounds of the animals and birds in the zoo rose up in the Jawalakhel sky. Every day, until much later in the 1970s, roar of the zoo’s lion (there were later other lions) diffused to far corners of the Valley, merging the zoo with the spirit of Kathmandu and informing the city folks of its presence.But was the zoo open to the public as well?“I think once it was built, the zoo was open for the public,” Subodh Rana said. “It is unlikely that Juddha Shumsher built such a large zoo and kept it only for his family.”For one, Kalyan Shumsher mentioning that one “need not travel abroad to see the incredible birds and animals found in foreign countries” suggests that the public had at least some access to the zoo. Of course, the Newar community from Na:Tole, Pulchowk and surrounding areas were permitted inside the zoo on the days of their guthi functions on Basanta Panchami and Bhoto Jatra.As the zoo was established at the back of the ground where Bhoto Jatra celebrations happen, it naturally filled with revellers on this day in addition to the guthi ritual observers as testified by the Gorkhapatra report. The photo of the mother and her sons also bear testimony that the zoo was not entirely closed to the public.What is widely believed, though, is that the zoo officially came under government ownership after Nepal became a democracy in 1951. And it would still be a few more years before it was open to the public in 1956.In 1945, Juddha gave up his power and eventually retired in Dehradun, India, where he died in 1952. With time, Jawalakhel Zoological Garden became the Central Zoo. It would take many avatars—a neglected site of crammed, unmaintained cages with sad eyes of emaciated creatures staring from behind the bars, a focal point of animal diplomacy, particularly during the period of monarchy, to, in its recent decades, a space of conservation and education.When all this was happening, the city sprawled around Jawalakhel, subduing the lion’s roar with its noise. More wildlife from around the country and the world came—creatures captured from the wild, those sold by circuses, those rescued from traffickers. Fate would bring these creatures to the care of generations of Kathmandu folks, intertwining each other’s joys and sorrows. After the tale of Juddha’s Jawalakhel Zoological Garden, there would be these stories to tell. Sitting around a table inside Juddha’s Juwa Ghar, Koirala and other zoo officials begin unfolding these stories before me. \nNepal’s book market is no stranger to the popular Bangladeshi-Swedish writer Taslima Nasrin. Almost all of her books have been translated into Nepali, but Nasrin herself says that they are all unauthorised translations. “All books [Nepali translations] are pirated versions,” Nasrin told the Post in a Whatsapp conversation. Nasrin, who is currently in exile in India after facing death threats in Bangladesh following the publication of her novel Lajja (Shame), said that she or her publishers have never allowed anyone the right to translate her books into Nepali. “I don’t know of any such Nepali publishers. No one asked for permission and no one has paid [me] royalty.”Translating and publishing books without permission from authors or publishers is a punishable crime. But Nepal’s book market is full of such unauthorised translations and prints of books written by the who’s who of the world literature. Such endeavours haven’t just hurt the authors but also the readers, says Ajit Baral, publisher of the Kathmandu-based Fineprint publication. “These translations are poor,” Baral says. “Tomes with 1200–1300 pages have been trimmed to 200–300 pages. An example is the biography of Bill Clinton.”Another popular book that has seen unauthorised Nepali translation is the biography of Steve Jobs by Walter Isaacson.“We have no official deal in place for a [Nepali] translation of Steve Jobs,” Peppa Mignone, associate agent of the CAA, the translation authority of the biography, said in an email interview with the Post.The book’s Nepali translation is published by Panchpokhari Publication House. The translated book identifies the translator thus: “Achyut Koirala, who has a master’s in English literature, is primarily a journalist. He is currently affiliated with Nagarik daily. He keeps a close tab on international history, politics and culture and has written scripts and dialogues for half a dozen Nepali films. He has published over a dozen non-fiction books.”Koirala, who admits to the unauthorised translation, claims that he hasn’t just translated the book but has also done ‘creative writing’ with it.‘Rich Dad Poor Dad’, written by Robert Kiyosaki and Sharon Lechter, is among the books that’s perennially on the bestseller list across the world. Upon investigation, the Post found three Nepali translations of the book—all unauthorised. One of them is translated by Dilip Kumar Shrestha and published by the same firm, the Panchpokhari Publication House. Another Nepali iteration of the book is published by Book For All publication and translated by Kopila MD. Yet another Nepali version is translated by one Sudheer Dixit and published by Plata Publication, Kathmandu.In an email conversation with the Post, Ronson Taylor, who oversees the international rights at The Rich Dad Company, said, “At this point in time, we do not have a relationship with an established publisher in the [Nepali] language market. If there are any Rich Dad Poor Dad books currently for sale in the Nepali market, they are pirated.”Basanta Thapa, a writer and translator, says that many books are being translated of late to make easy money. “But how would the quality of these unauthorised translations be!” Thapa wonders. “Readers who haven’t read the original wouldn’t know the faults in the translated versions.” Thapa says that any translator worth his salt aims to ‘recreate’ a book and it takes much work to do that.Taslima’s books are the major victimsTaslima’s memoir Uttal Hawa has been translated into Nepali as ‘Sangharsha’, literally Struggle, and is published by Khoji Publication House. Even though the book in its cover claims that it is an authorised translation from the English version Wild Wind, it is a pirated one. The book is translated by Bikash Basnet and edited by Bhogiraj Chamling. A revised version of the book is edited by Sangeet Srota (Yam Bahadur Chhetri).The same publication house has also published the Nepali translation of the book’s sequel as ‘Prem ra Jeevan’. Publisher Sushil Chalise says that while he is aware that one needs to receive permission from the author or the publisher to translate a book, his efforts to contact Taslima were unsuccessful. Therefore, he had published the version the translator made available to him. Translator Basnet, too, admits he translated the book without Taslima’s permission. “About a decade back, we didn’t know how to ask for permission,” he said.Nepal has the Copyright Act (2002) in place. Before it, there was the The Patent, Design and Trade Mark Act, 2022 (1965) that included intellectual property in its 2006 revision. Even the Muluki Ain (Civil Code) of 1910 BS had a provision about copyright. Moreover, it goes without saying that translating somebody else’s work without permission is immoral.Likewise, Indigo Ink Pvt Ltd has published a Nepali translation of Taslima’s anthology of essays No Country for Women as ‘Aaimai ko Kunai Desh Chhaina’. The book is translated by Krishna Giri and edited by Pramod Pradhan. “I have no idea about the agreement between the publisher and translator,” Pradhan, who is also a children’s book writer, says. “I just copy-edited it upon request.”Bishnukumar Poudel, publisher of Indigo Ink, however, claims that he is still trying to take translation rights for the book. “We translated the book long ago,” he says. “We are still trying to get translation rights.”Indigo is also publishing unauthorised translations under its imprints All Book Store Pvt Ltd, Book for All and Plata Publication. It has published two versions of Rich Dad Poor Dad under those shadow imprints. But Plata Publication is not registered in the Company Registrar’s Office.Pradhan says that many foreign books have had unauthorised translations in Nepali and their quality is poor. Those books are translated not from the original language but from a second or third language, so these translations are bound to have problems, he says. “After I learned that those were unauthorised translations, I have stopped editing them,” Pradhan said.Indian author Shiv Khera’s You Can Win has been translated into Nepali by Bloomsbury India and has granted the distribution rights to Ekta Books. But the book’s unauthorised translations are also found in the market and they don’t even mention the name of the publisher and translator. What is interesting is they mention that it’d be illegal to republish the book, or an excerpt of it, without the author’s permission.The Nepali translation of the book, which was poorly written and rife with inaccuracies, had landed the publisher at court. After a complaint was filed at the District Court Kathmandu in 2066BS on the charge that the publisher violated the copyrights and economic rights, the court had issued a verdict on Mangsir 11 that year, charging a fine of Rs10,000, Rs20,000 and Rs30,000 to the defendants Netra Prasad Pokharel, Narayan Prasad Bhusal, and Bhagwati Risal and Bishnu Silwal, respectively.Baral, the Fineprint publisher, says that international publishers wouldn’t demand much for translation rights given Nepal’s small market, but Nepali publishers do not bother to reach out to them. “Publishers who put out unauthorised translations and sell them at 50 percent discount have troubled publishers like us,” he said.Fineprint has published authorised translated versions of books such as Leaving Microsoft to Change the World by John Wood, Healed by Manisha Koirala, and Hippie by Paulo Coelho. The publication house is also set to release the Nepali translation of Israeli historian Yuval Noah Harari’s bestseller Sapiens. Translated into Nepali by Dinesh Kafle, the book’s translation right was acquired at the cost of USD1300, Baral said. Likewise, the publication acquired the translation rights of Sadhguru’s Inner Engineering at IRS93,000, he added.Baral says that publication of unauthorised translations is an immoral and illegal work. “This phenomenon not just hampers Nepal’s fledgling book publishing industry but also tarnishes the country’s reputation in the global market,” Baral said.Thapa, the writer and translator, points out the lack of regulatory mechanisms in the country. “We don’t have an agency that regulates the quality of translations being done,” he says. “Nobody compares the translation with the original. We need a dedicated authority to enhance the quality of translation.” Universities, Nepal Academy and other stakeholders can play a role to uplift the translation sector, he adds.One’s pain, another’s pleasureWhen the author Suketu Mehta was travelling through Mumbai, a young man approached him with a handful of books while his vehicle was stuck in traffic. Brandishing Maximum City, written by none other than Mehta himself, the young man requested the author to buy a copy. Suketu leafed through the book and said, “This is a pirated copy and I’m the author of this book.” The youth wasn’t bothered and replied, “Okay, you can buy it at a discount.”This anecdote was shared to the Post by Mehta’s friend, the author and professor Amitava Kumar, in an email exchange.Most of these pirated books are imported into Nepal from India while the retailers of original books are finding themselves increasingly in trouble. “We sell original copies but many readers doubt us as well, given the ubiquity of pirated versions,” says Anjan Shrestha, operator of Education Book House, Jamal.Ramchandra Timothy, chair of Thapathali-based Ekta Books Pvt Ltd, said that the phenomenon of piracy has tarnished Nepal’s image internationally. “There was a time when Bangladesh would be known as ‘piracy king’,” he said. “Now there's a risk Nepal would take the crown.”As tax increases, so does piracyThe government decision to impose a 10 percent tax on book imports in fiscal year 2019-20 led to a proliferation of pirated book markets, booksellers say. After the decision, booksellers started to cut back on imports and that led to the entry of a new crop of pirated booksellers, a trader in Kathmandu says. But following widespread backlash, then finance minister Bishnu Paudel struck down the policy.“After the government’s decision, we stopped importing books for a while,” says Shrestha of Education Books. “The import of books went down for about two years. Then the pirates stepped in to fill the gap. It was about that time that pirated copies of biographies and memoirs of Obamas and Jai Shettys became omnipresent in the market.”Pirated copies of classics by Roald Dahl and JK Rowling also made an entry in the Nepali market. Then the phenomenon only saw a rise.Since the customs department does not levy duty on foreign books and also does not care to differentiate between the pirated and original copies, unauthorised books have found a safe haven in Nepali market.The government doesn’t levy any customs duty on books and newspapers published by foreign publishers abroad. The importers should only pay Rs565 at the customs points. But Nepali publishers have to pay 10 percent tax to import books printed in India.James Taylor, director of Communications and Freedom to Publish of the International Publishers Association, says that the government, publishers, writers and readers should join hands to control widespread piracy. “The government should realise that book publishing and reading culture contribute to the country’s economy as well,” he said, adding that the government should seize pirated books and close websites that sell pirated ebooks.Nandan Jha, executive vice chair of Penguin Random House India’s sales, production and business department, says that piracy has emerged as a big challenge for publishers of late and has harmed the authors, publishers, distributors, printers, readers and other stakeholders. “To confront piracy, all the stakeholders should launch a special joint effort,” Jha told the Post in an email exchange.Piracy has proliferated in the Nepali market to such an extent that the publishers of such books and unauthorised translations keep whatever ISBN numbers they like, often conflicting with other books, and still get off scot free. If scanned or searched on the internet, the ISBN number gives details on the author of the book, what the book is about, and its price, among others.Bijay Sharma, information officer at TU Library, says, “Keeping ISBN number at one’s will is illegal. If anyone files a complaint, we can punish them.”By the lawThe Muluki Ain-1910 BS had mandated that a publisher take permission of Gorkha Bhasa Prakashini Samiti before publishing any material. The Copyrights Act came into effect in 2022 BS and was amended in 2054 BS. In 2059 BS, a new Act was promulgated and it is still effective now. Authorities are currently working to amend the Act to give the registrar’s office more autonomy regarding copyright.According to the 2059 BS Act, copyright violations are considered government cases. In such cases, plaintiffs should file a complaint with the police. The Act’s clause 25 has various conditions that amount to violation of copyright. The Act’s subclause A says that if a publisher produces or copies material in writing or sound and sells or distributes it, it amounts to violation of copyright.Likewise, the Act’s clause 26 prevents selling of unauthorised material. The clause restricts the ‘importation of copies of work or sound recording, either made in a foreign country or sourced otherwise, into Nepal for business purpose shall not be permitted if preparation of such copies would be considered illegal if they were prepared in Nepal.’If anyone infringes upon protected rights, they are liable to punishment but the provision’s implementation remains lax.The law gives the authority to district court to take legal action against copyright violators.Advocate Parshuram Koirala says that if the government becomes more proactive, it can punish violators on the basis of the 2059 BS Act and thereby control the phenomenon of intellectual theft and copyright violations. “Creation is a crucial part of humanity’s benefit,” he says. “If intellectual property is not protected effectively, then there’d be no inspiration to create something.”Bal Bahadur Mukhiya, a professor at Nepal Law Campus, suggests the inclusion of rules about digital piracy in law, and also the clauses of various related international treaties and agreements that Nepal is part of.“In the US, a teacher or professor should pay a certain revenue even to photocopy a chapter of some text for teaching purposes,” Mukhiya says. “But in Nepal, those who photocopy an entire book and sell it go scot free.”(This report is prepared in collaboration with the Centre for Investigative Journalism, Nepal.) \nWhenever I mention that I’m researching Nepal’s Grand Strategy, the initial reaction I often get—even from well-informed individuals—is one of disbelief. Although they are too polite to say it aloud, I can almost hear them thinking, “Are you out of your mind?”Many people doubt whether Nepal’s democratic governments of the post-1990 era can formulate a coherent foreign policy, let alone deliberate on a grand strategy. The psychological outlook we’ve inherited as citizens of a country sandwiched between two giants and the chaotic nature of our foreign policy establishment fuel this scepticism. Adding to that is the nostalgia for the finesse and pomp with which the palace once operated. Is there some truth to these perceptions?The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MoFA) has been primarily relegated to administrative functions, lacking both intellectual direction and a political mandate from the top leadership. The Nepali Defence Ministry is often jokingly called a “post box.” But has the MoFA’s role dwindled to a little more than passport printing and logistical support for foreign visits?Our top leaders' overreliance on personal dealings with foreign counterparts—often through non-state intermediaries—continues to tarnish public perception and weaken the foreign policy establishment as a whole. During extreme crises and trust deficits, relying on private individuals or non-state actors as messengers and influencers may be acceptable. However, habitually abusing it undermines state capacity and risks state interest manipulation.Foreign Minister Arzu Rana Deuba’s visit to India last week elicited scepticism in some quarters. However, the optics of meeting top Indian leaders were hailed by many as proof of a successful visit. Rana in DelhiRana's red-carpet treatment in New Delhi, including a meeting with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, symbolises India’s comfort with the Nepali Congress’ presence in the new ruling coalition. There is no denying that the Nepali Congress is favourably regarded in New Delhi and Washington, which speaks to the party's legacy and ability to communicate with these key partners. Moreover, we cannot misread the hospitality accorded to Rana, a significant Nepali Congress leader and the spouse of the prime minister-in-waiting.One might assume that Rana carried a message from Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli, assuring New Delhi that Kathmandu seeks to maintain cordial relations and resolve bilateral irritants, including the Kalapani issue and Nepal’s new map, through mutual consultation. However, the pre-departure press release from MoFA was terse, stating that Rana would “discuss matters of mutual interest.” The Indian press release offered more details, mentioning discussions on the “full range of the India-Nepal bilateral partnership,” including progress on power trade and sports cooperation. Later, the Nepali embassy in Delhi made cursory references to various issues, including air routes for Bhairahawa and Pokhara airports.Many issues need to be resolved: Kalapani, air routes, preferential treatment for Nepali goods, Nepali recruitments in the Indian Army after the Agniveer scheme and the Eminent Persons Group (EPG) report, among others. Despite numerous high-level exchanges annually or with every government change on both sides, the issues regarding perceived security sensitivities have been ring-fenced; there seems to be a tacit agreement between both governments to remain quiet about this matter. Instead, both sides want to oversell the issues of high-voltage optics around development. “Yes, we agreed to add another 200 MW of electricity to an already bright bilateral relationship.” Deferring discussions on these difficult issues only festers the problem. While Nepal needs to respect India’s genuine security concerns and proactively address them, the latter needs to stop exaggerating its security sensitivities to impede things it doesn’t like.Overall, the visit was limited mainly to symbolism—a courtesy call to Nepal’s most important partner by a new foreign minister, conveying an invitation from a prime minister perceived as difficult in New Delhi due to his nationalist stance and occasional ‘leanings toward Beijing.’Initially, the Indian Ministry of External Affairs was comparatively more transparent and offered some substance beyond the vague reference to usual ‘issues of mutual interest.’ Additionally, Indian press reports mentioned that Rana would use the visit for a health check-up. I don’t believe that Nepali government departments are inherently less transparent than their Indian counterparts. The issue lies in our permanent governments' diminishing involvement in setting the agenda for high-level exchanges, especially with key partners and subsequent public communication. Compared to their Indian counterparts, MoFA officials appear to have less space and autonomy to shape the visit’s agenda. Politicians caught up in their myopic power struggles can perhaps be forgiven for failing to consider civil service reforms. However, it’s astonishing that no chief secretary has advocated strengthening the permanent government’s strategy in the last decade. Instead, some have tried installing cameras to monitor their colleagues without addressing the root causes of poor performance. So, it is appropriate to question whether the problem lies in the structure, the hiring policies, the pay incentives, the skillsets, or all of the above.The more politicians and civil servants undermine the role of Nepali institutions, the more the agency of Nepal and Nepalis will diminish, and it will become more favourable for powerful foreign influencers to dictate everything. Greater transparency, restoration of normal administrative processes and strict adherence to standard operating procedures in diplomatic dealings are the only ways to restore the credibility lost in the public’s eyes. Allowing public cynicism to fester is, in many ways, akin to a self-fulfilling prophecy, as beliefs are as powerful as actual events. \nA popular question often arises in the international sphere: Will Nepal fall under China’s influence? It is generally assumed that leftist parties in Nepal are close to China and democratic parties to India and the US. As a result, the leftists are assumed to favour Chinese interests and the latter favour India’s interests in the emerging geopolitical game.During our closed-door dialogue with several influential leaders from the Nepali Congress, CPN-UML and the Maoist Centre who have held important ministries, one takeaway was that Nepali political leaders across major parties have a sophisticated understanding of Nepal’s core national interests concerning geopolitics. Despite divergent ideologies and differing affinities with China and India, they have surprising commonalities in their policy positions. However, on Nepal’s external relations, the problem is not about fundamental differences in defining national interests or political affinities with India and China. The issue lies in managing four key factors that subvert policy positions: Geo-political squeeze, narrow political interests, corruption dynamics and weak negotiation capacities.Geopolitical pressuresGeo-political competition in Nepal is most apparent in five arenas: Political influence, connectivity and critical infrastructure, market, resources and security. Our political leaders and decision-makers are under immense pressure from the big powers to make decisions that suit their interests in these areas.In recent years, China has sought to cultivate close ties with political parties, especially those on the left, and encourage “independence” from India’s influence. Political influence is linked to the global rivalry in political values and world visions offered by China and the US. As a result, big powers have attempted to influence Nepal’s role in the international arena, including the United Nations. For the big powers, political influence is also a means of achieving their interests in connectivity, infrastructure, markets, resources and security. Such competition, if not managed, can lead to severe conflicts.After the peace process, India became wary of China’s influence in Nepal. This rivalry intensified after the 2017 Doklam standoff and the 2020 Galwan Valley conflict. Consequently, India began to discourage Chinese engagements in Nepal. India-China relations directly impact Chinese investments’ feasibility in Nepal, including the Trans-Himalayan Multi-Dimensional Connectivity Network, which aspires to access the Indian market. It is apparent that Chinese investments in the hydropower sector have shrunk due to India’s policy on power trade. Therefore, the goals of the Nepal-China Industrial Park in Damak are achievable only if relations between India and China improve.Nepal’s critical infrastructure, including transmission lines, telecommunications and digital infrastructure, is another sensitive sector. Geopolitical actors' involvement in these sectors may generate further vulnerabilities for Nepal’s national security.Multiple cases worldwide have demonstrated that geopolitical competition is also about tapping resources and raw materials. Nepal has a few resources that China needs. However, Chinese companies have benefited from substantial procurement contracts, funded mainly by Nepal and multilateral agencies.For China, Nepal is an attractive market in the short term and a gateway to South Asia in the long term. China’s engagements with Nepal and its policies in Tibet indicate that the country is betting big on accessing the South Asian market. However, this is another area in which India is very sensitive. Given China and India’s emphasis on security, they will exert more pressure on Nepal’s security sector, which receives little attention in Nepali public space.Vulnerabilities and potential conflictOur foreign policy goals should focus on resisting external economic and political pressures, avoiding geopolitical conflict, fostering trusted relationships with India and China and aligning external relations with our national interests. So, it is essential to recognise and address our vulnerabilities first. The leverage big powers have in shaping political leaders’ careers and domestic power dynamics is the major source of vulnerability in foreign policy decision-making. As external actors offer significant incentives, political leaders must fear them and be eager to appease them for personal benefit.Corruption and financial interests continue to influence some of Nepal’s policy decisions. In the case of Pokhara International Airport, political actors, influenced by kickbacks and economic interests, moved the process from outside government institutions and mobilised the public to pressure decision-makers. The prevalence of many such cases shows that corruption dynamics will continue to influence decision-making across all political spectrums and other sectors unless we have accountability and transparency in aid and infrastructure projects.Nepal’s vulnerability also stems from weak negotiation capacity and communication skills. Regarding dealing with big powers, Nepal lacks the necessary diplomatic mechanisms, skills and knowledge to promote national interest. It must take immediate steps to reduce the potential for geopolitical conflict. First, Nepal must set a clear course on the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). China is pushing the BRI by gradually subsuming all forms of bilateral cooperation under the BRI framework. However, the implications of China's move are not yet clear. Although Nepal has already signed the BRI and should look forward to the initiative, it must enhance its negotiation capacity, address vulnerable areas and communicate better with China and other big powers to ensure mutual benefit.Given the rivalry between India and China, Nepal must ensure that China feels safe from India’s engagements and vice versa. Nepal once had an informal policy where Chinese small-scale aid was limited to the northern districts and Indian small-scale aid was limited to the southern districts. However, the situation has changed in recent years as Chinese activities have increased in the southern border areas, and Indian activities have increased in the northern border areas. Nepal must ensure that such activities do not generate security dilemmas.Another immediate step is to communicate Nepal’s position on security cooperation through a white paper to provide no room for misunderstanding among big powers about what Nepal will and will not do. Such a paper will be critical in developing trusted relations with big powers amidst growing geo-political rivalry. To reduce geopolitical conflict and ensure national interest, all political parties and leaders must agree to a common code of conduct for cultivating relations with external forces and political actors, which must be communicated well to international actors.After all, the question for Nepal is not about whether it will fall under China’s influence but how it can benefit from geopolitical competition and maintain a trusted relationship with all the big powers. \nMigration has been a prominent feature of Nepali society for most of its history. The initial large outflow for enrolment in the British and Indian armies, migration to India for work, and labour migration to the Gulf countries and Malaysia represent three epochs that have characterised its trend over the last 200 years. Although, ostensibly, toiling in the sun in the Arab countries differs considerably from fighting as mercenaries in the two world wars, the two have more in common than is perceptible at first glance. Circumstances, conditions and implications of migration and return have been perpetuated or allowed by those in power. The agency of migrants and their ability to render migration an informed choice remains attenuated for most, with migration still a compulsion and an agonising familial separation to sustain livelihood. Migration continues to be “choreographed” for the majority, even if not to the levels of inducement, enjoinment and coercion practised by the Rana regime to supply recruits to the British Indian army.The choreographyBir Shumsher, to solicit British support for his nascent regime after ascending to premier, agreed to their wishes of expanding the extant Gurkha battalions and supplied recruits accordingly from 1885. It then precipitated during the First World War and was later replicated by Juddha Shumsher during the Second World War. The Ranas employed every tactic in the book to supply recruits, enticing not only the recruits and the recruiters but also village leaders; many were coerced and forced to enlist. This explicit migration choreography would be considered a violation of human rights in contemporary times. Notwithstanding, the migration of Nepalis for work abroad continues to be choreographed to a large extent, albeit more subtly.The opening line of Warsan Shire’s poem, Home, “No one leaves home unless home is the mouth of a shark”, captures the emotions of many Nepali migrant workers who feel compelled to leave the country. With the grim prospects within the country, particularly for those who could not avail themselves of quality education available only in select regions, migration becomes inevitable. Rather than a voluntary application of one’s right to mobility, it is an avenue to ensure livelihood for many as a last resort. The government has done little to deter outmigration but instead has allowed the perpetuation of the structural factors that necessitate it. Further, notwithstanding the speeches of political leaders, government policies encourage labour migration, as evidenced by inducements such as allotments to migrant workers in the public offerings of companies in the Nepal Stock Exchange and the recently introduced collateral-free loans for those repatriating remittances. There is a discrepancy between the proclaimed goal of enhancing employment opportunities within the country and the policies formulated.Tendentious market power asymmetries characterise the global labour market, leaving migrant workers with little bargaining strength. The supply of workers is much higher than its demand, so governments and companies in destination countries can dictate favourable terms and conditions with little resistance. Destination country governments treat migrant workers as second-class citizens, allowing no opportunities for naturalisation and imposing stringent restrictions on mobility. Employer companies similarly confiscate passports and discriminate based on age, laying off migrant workers who are past their prime working years. Thus, migrant workers are dismissed years after investing in the job, causing skills and confidence loss. They are labelled with the epithet “temporary workers”, which is as exploitative as it is denigrating. Through this, the origin country bears the burden of their unproductive years—childhood and old age—while destination countries reap the benefits but externalise the costs.The agency of the migrant workers is compromised both in their decision to migrate and return. Institutional structures compel them to dance to the choreography imposed by other actors who also profit from their migration.Maintaining the status quo Outmigration from Nepal for work has had the pernicious effect of acting as a palliative to maintain the national order—political or economic—allowing those in power to avoid painful reform measures. Although not as unequivocal as the Rana regime's ploy to stay in power, today's import-based economy relies on remittances to sustain itself. Without this insulation, it is inconceivable how the economic order would be maintained, even in the short term.Another aspect of this is the surplus labour in the country. Labour migration from Nepal constitutes a virtuous cycle whereby its surplus migrates to foreign nations with labour shortages or demands. It does not divest the Nepali industrial or service sectors of labour but helps match the excess human resources with jobs abroad, producing optimal outcomes. The migrant workers repatriate remittances in return—a win-win.However, this highlights the inability of the Nepali economy to absorb these workers. They would be either unemployed or underemployed without the option to migrate, bringing about social and political turmoil. Migration is thus essential in the short term but with the dangers of lulling policymakers into inaction and producing moral hazard by allowing them to escape by not implementing painful but necessary reforms.Migrant worker woesDespite this indispensability, it is migrant workers who face the brunt of the consequences. They migrate for 3D (dirty, dangerous and difficult) jobs, which renders them vulnerable to abuse and exploitation. The Nepali government has resorted to imprudent, blanket approaches to protect migrant workers, with the feckless bans on female labour migration for domestic work serving as an example. Again, these bans choreograph migrations based on state expediency without considering migrant workers’ compulsion to migrate, thus exacerbating their vulnerabilities by forcing them to use informal routes. They have, however, allowed the government an excuse when questioned.When the utility of migrant workers is assumed to have waned, they are discarded by governments and employers in destination countries without sufficient financial assistance or an alternative option back home. The disbandment of the Gurkha battalions in the aftermath of the Second World War still serves as a poignant picture. The same is true for migrant workers in the Gulf, many of whom earn enough to educate their children but not to retire. Most of them engage in menial work post-return, as the skills they learnt abroad are inapplicable in the Nepali job market, all the while looking for opportunities to remigrate. Despite such hardships, they cannot escape the structural factors that prompted their migration in the first place. \nOur roads are becoming increasingly unsafe due to poor and haphazard construction, natural disasters. But more often than not, it is because our drivers are overworked, and there is hardly any solid monitoring mechanism in place to check their physical and mental status. Providing resting time for drivers becomes even more crucial during monsoons, when landslides obstruct roads and the journeys become longer.Realising the need to provide drivers with resting time and place, the Lumbini Province Government started building five “smart refresh centres” in Bardaghat in Nawalparasi West, Sainamaina in Rupandehi, Chandrauta in Kapilvastu, Lamahi in Dang, and Bardiya along the East-West Highway four years ago. These centres promise washrooms, eateries, restrooms, shower rooms, charging stations, parking area, among other amenities, to help drivers and passengers tackle fatigue during long-distance travels. However, due to budget constraints, the project hasn’t seen the light of day yet. While the idea of starting the refresh centres is laudable, there is a clear lack of coordination among political parties to complete the project. The ambitious project took shape in Lumbini during the CPN-UML government when it set aside around Rs110 million. But the government was ousted even as it began construction work, and the new government, led by the Maiosts, slashed the budget for the project. The project got shelved by subsequent governments. Even though the first phase of the project (only the construction of the building) has been completed in Sainamaina, its operation has been halted as it lacks proper guidelines for functioning. The experiment in Lumbini has been a failed project.Nepal’s Motor Vehicle and Transport Management Act mandates drivers to rest after six hours of driving. However, the authorities have failed to enforce the rules, let alone arrange proper rest areas for the drivers. Safer roads not only improve road safety but also help the country's tourism flourish. As we strive to expand our tourism agenda by attracting more tourists, the importance of ensuring basic resting facilities along the highways cannot be overstated. Providing the best services for tourists will attract them to the country, thereby boosting our economy and buttressing international reputation. While it is encouraging that several other provinces have rest centres along highways, the conditions are far from decent. Most of these centres lack basic sanitary and hygiene services. Moreover, such small projects lack sufficient construction as well as maintenance funds, as has been the case in Lumbini. The governments’ tendency to consider them “trivial” is equally concerning. Such a mindset not only hinders our journey towards making roads safer but also other opportunities that come along with it, including tourism promotion and passenger satisfaction. As highway accidents become a regular phenomenon in Nepal, we need more smart refresh centres. The federal government should therefore come on board and help provincial and local governments construct these centres through enough budget allocation on need basis. It is also necessary to devise a plan to maintain and renovate existing ones that lack enough amenities for drivers and passengers. Meanwhile, political parties should heed the projects that are in the best interests of people, and not weigh them on the basis of whether they fall under their party’s priority or not. \nThe energy sector remained one of Nepal’s most vibrant sectors for over a year. Some encouraging news brightened the country’s mood even as the overall economy remained stagnant. In June last year, Nepal and India inked a long-term power trade agreement, whereby the southern neighbour would import 10,000 MW of hydroelectricity from Nepal in 10 years. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi made the announcement at a joint press meet with Nepali counterpart Pushpa Kamal Dahal, who was on a visit to India. Based on the same deal, India has been gradually increasing the quantum of energy it is importing from Nepal. On Monday, New Delhi approved a plan to import an additional 251 MW of electricity from Nepal, increasing the total imports to nearly 1,000 MW. Nepal, which was heavily dependent on India’s electricity until a few years ago, became a net exporter of electricity last fiscal. Encouraged by the potential market in India and other neighbouring countries including Bangladesh, investors have been injecting huge investments in this sector. Work to build transmission lines and substations has picked up in recent months. Nepal and Bangladesh were all set to sign an agreement last month on the export of Nepal’s 40 MW of electricity via India, only to be cancelled due to political unrest in the South Asian nation. Even as Nepal makes great strides in electricity production and exports, our villages still remain unelectrified. According to the Nepal Electricity Authority’s latest report, 18 of the country’s 753 local government units are not connected to the national grid. According to the NEA report published on Tuesday, 1 percent of the total population is still deprived of the basic facility. Even in the rest of the parts of the country covered by the national grid, electricity supply is still erratic. Moreover, while the import of electric vehicles (EVs) is rising, exhibiting a keen interest among Nepalis to switch from fossil fuel to electricity, the government doesn’t seem to be keeping pace. While it is yet to build the infrastructure for electric vehicles, including charging stations, its policy on import and sales of such vehicles isn’t consistent. Another important area where the government should concentrate its efforts on is increasing the consumption of electricity in the kitchens of Nepalis across the country. The ministry of energy should devise some attractive schemes to replace cooking gas with electric stoves. Authorities don’t seem to be seriously working on these fronts. Instead, the government at times looks derailed. At a time when it needs to expedite work to replace fossil fuel-based activities with electricity, the government is preparing to build oil pipeline connecting Siliguri of India to Charali in Jhapa, a greenfield tank terminal in Charali, and an extension of the pipeline from Amlekhgunj to Lothar in Chitwan with India’s support.Promoting electricity and fossil fuel usage at the same time, the government seems to be trying to have it both ways. This approach is wrong approach. What the government should do is to formulate a clear policy of promoting clean energy-based activities and formulate a comprehensive plan on energy production and consumption. That should be guided by the approach of increasing domestic consumption and exporting surplus production. This strategy has multiple benefits. Replacement of the huge quantity of imported fossil fuels with electricity saves billions of rupees, helps rejuvenate the country’s economy and decarbonises the transport and other sectors. \nIn June, when the Cabinet decided to make National Identity Card (NID) mandatory for accessing government services, including social security allowances, it was widely criticised, with even federal lawmakers voicing their disapproval. The Home Ministry had announced that the directive would be enforced in 28 districts, setting a deadline of mid-July. This decision had “terrorised people”, as they feared they would be deprived of social security services, and many registered in haste.But the government last month decided to overturn the directive with equal haste. Now, the Nepalis are left confused: To obtain it or not to obtain it? Seemingly disbelieving the government's changing position on the use of the NID, over half a million people opted for it between mid-June to mid-July. Yet, there is little information about whether the government has worked out the behind-the-scenes procedures for its proper utility. Despite the NID’s design to combine important identity cards and documents including driving licenses, academic documents, voting cards, insurance details, and ATM card numbers in a single chip, implementing agencies still lack the infrastructure for such an endeavour. This technological hurdle adds to the already challenging task of fully executing the NID card campaign six years after the government started distributing it. Moreover, the hubbub surrounding the NID’s “revolutionary” function has proven to be dubious—it is either of no use or is imposed arbitrarily on the people. This is a prime example of how our authorities care not to think about its citizens' comfort or welfare when they come up with new policies or schemes. The authorities' main argument for implementing the NID is that it will be a one-stop solution for surveilling and controlling criminal activities like financial fraud by removing duplication. Article 51 of the Constitution of Nepal 2015 pledges to develop an integrated national identity management information system and manage citizens' data. The NID and Registration Act 2020 states that personal privacy would be ensured in its usage. But experts believe the document has several loopholes as it does not discuss data protection. Sensitive data and information of the citizens are the nation's assets, and they must be safeguarded diligently. However, the government is yet to fully assure citizens about data privacy; what is working in the government’s favour is that many lack digital literacy enough to know about their privacy rights. Moreover, the government has not clearly explained how it plans to segregate information access by multiple agencies, as the NID provides an integrated database of different information. This paints a murky picture of Nepal’s cyber security ecosystem, as data security is fragile, and hackers often target government websites. Ever since the launch of the Adhaar Card in India, there have been numerous cases of duping, misuse and information leak. The government must learn from the mistakes of its next-door neighbour before launching a “grand” campaign to digitalise identification. The government would do well to return to the basics before taking any further steps and clearly address the concerns of experts, lawmakers and citizens about why and how the card is an important addition to other identifications like citizenship, driving license, and passport. Moreover, the authorities should first ideate on the utility, functionality and safety of the NID before imposing it on the citizens.  \nLately, road accidents are taking place almost every day. Thousands of people lose their lives in road crashes every year across the country. What are the factors causing these disasters? Why have the authorities failed to prevent them? The Post's Thira Lal Bhusal sat down with former secretary Arjun Jung Thapa, who was director general at the Department of Roads for years, to discuss the pressing issue.Why are road accidents taking place so frequently in Nepal? There is no one reason for road accidents. On the infrastructure front, factors like design, condition and geometry of a road are crucial. Putting sign boards along the roads and giving vital information about the particular location is necessary. Those signs should be placed properly so all driving vehicles and passengers can see them clearly. Some technical aspects, such as whether the superelevation is properly designed, particularly at sharp bends, matter greatly. These must be regularly monitored and corrected in time. Regular vehicle fitness tests are essential. Experienced and disciplined drivers are equally important to ensure road safety. Some accidents occur when drivers are unfamiliar with the roads. For instance, the accident that took place at Anbukhaireni of Tanahun district on Friday, killing 27 Indian nationals, might have been because of the driver’s lack of familiarity with the road condition. Yet another serious concern is the lack of road discipline. Those who come to Nepal with years-long experience of driving abroad fear driving because of motorists' reckless driving and lack of lane discipline. The recent accident at Jadibuti, killing one scooter rider, could have been avoided if proper lane discipline had been followed. Reckless driving by motorcyclists has remained a big problem in our case. So, a separate lane should be designated for bikers. Similarly, lanes should be designated for vehicles based on their speed. But such rules are never followed seriously in our case. Traffic police have been entrusted with enforcing traffic rules but lack the human resources to enforce them effectively. We need an integrated and centrally controlled digital traffic light management system. We had experimented with a system as a trial for some time after 2015. We called a bid but couldn’t accept anyone as the bidders proposed more than the rate we had fixed. The project collapsed, and that system could never be revived. We badly lack technology in this sector. When we try to import technology, brokers get involved and ruin the entire process. The condition of roads built haphazardly, mainly in the hills, is another major concern. What do you say about that?We have built around 80,000 kilometres of road across the country. Of that, only around 14,000 kilometres fall under the jurisdiction of the road department. The rest of the road sections fall under the jurisdiction of various authorities, such as the Department of Local Infrastructure and provincial and local governments. The busiest roads are those under the Department of Roads. They are highways and regional roads. Only 50 percent of the roads overseen by the Department of Roads are blacktopped and are not maintained properly. Of the remaining 65,000 kilometres of road, only 4,000 kilometres are blacktopped. This means that the road condition across the country is poor and must be upgraded. The government will now develop the Kakarvitta-Gorusinghe section of the East-West Highway as a safe demonstration corridor. There will be proper infrastructure for crossings, grade-separated intersections, controlled entries, fencing for the safety from wild animals and crossings for wildlife. Local vehicles will run on service lanes. If it is developed as planned, it would be on par with Asian standards. Other roads in the pipeline will follow these standards. These criteria are being implemented while upgrading the Nagdhunga-Mugling road section as well. We have miles to go to upgrade our roads to international standards. Why are we failing to make quality roads?We can’t build our roads according to the original design. At times, locals obstruct road construction and force us to change the alignments. Then, we have to build them based on the availability of the land.Are our rural roads fit from the engineering perspective?Around 35,000 kilometers out of the 65,000 kilometers of roads that don’t fall under the jurisdiction of the Department of Roads are built randomly. Local leaders, influential individuals, and bulldozer operators fix the alignments of such roads.How can we rectify the malpractices in this sector?We need to activate the National Road Safety Council urgently. Officials from all the concerned departments and representatives from various stakeholders should sit together in this body and find solutions. Also, coordination has become more complicated in the federal system. For instance, highways are under federal jurisdiction, transport management on highways falls under provincial authority, while road management is under federal jurisdiction. Therefore, an effective coordinating body has become a must. Otherwise, we can’t control the increasing trend of deaths in road accidents. At least 1,700 people lost their lives in 2013, and the then government set a target to reduce it by at least 50 percent by 2020. Instead, the yearly death toll has crossed 2,800 now.While it takes years to complete road upgrading tasks, construction materials are left unmanaged and scattered, making driving along the road very difficult and dangerous. Can’t such things be improved?Contractors are powerful because of their political connection with influential leaders including prime ministers and ministers. Civil servants can’t be assertive when the contractors get political protection. At times, they try to use force to coerce government officials. If the situation is not going in their favour, they provoke locals with a plan to get extension in their contract citing local unrest. Experts say that the government is also to blame as it doesn’t carry out development projects properly. Do you agree?I worked for three decades in government agencies until a few months ago. What I found is that one government devises specific policies, plans and initiates certain projects but successive governments stop them. The new leadership starts its own plans and projects. Then, the contractors don’t get their payment. This is the other side of the story. Another problem is that our ministers, lawmakers and leaders show interest in the projects that deserve the least priority while important projects don’t get attention. For instance, around 30 kilometers of Arniko Highway, which connects Nepal with China, has been badly damaged. This is a very important road for the country. Can’t the government repair and maintain a 30-kilometer section of a highway? It requires just around Rs3 billion whereas leaders have allocated over Rs11.5 billion in the projects of personal interests of leaders. Around Rs4 billion has been allocated under lawmakers’ constituency development programmes and additional Rs5 billion has been earmarked for local bridges. We have allocated around Rs60 billion for non-important projects but we have ignored a crucial road, Arniko Highway, which was built with the support of our neighbour China in the 1960s. Thus we have given unnecessary importance where it doesn’t deserve while ignoring vital development projects. The road accidents are directly or indirectly linked to the government’s wrong policies and plans.Development projects are sometimes said to have failed due to rivalry between some leaders. Do you have any such experience?I will give you an example. In the Biratnagar-Bathnaha cross-border rail project, we had to build over 13 kilometers of the railway. It was around four to five years ago. We cleared over 11 kilometers but locals protested in the remaining section where a station was planned. The locals obstructed work there even as 85 percent of the money for land acquisition had already been distributed. Later, we found that the then minister Aman Lal Modi had provoked the locals to demand for additional money. He demanded a ‘special rate for his men’. But the laws don’t allow it.Some experts argue that to upgrade the quality of our roads, we need to make this sector competitive and, for that, we have to allow the private sector to develop projects. Is it viable?The government is hindering the private sector from entering into this business. They don’t invest without assured returns. They need roads like Kathmandu-Tarai Expressway. The government called for proposals in the build-operate-transfer (BOT) model for this project. They were interested. But the government simultaneously allowed a company to build the Kathmandu-Tunnel Road in the same area. Then the investors felt a risk to invest there. But, the company couldn’t continue the tunnel project. Private sector should be welcomed in this sector but we should create a conducive environment for that. Bangladesh and India have built infrastructure projects under the BOT model. We can do it as well.What do you think about the jurisdictional dispute over the New Road stretch between the Kathmandu Metropolis and the Department of Roads? Who should maintain this road?All the roads within the metropolis fall under the local government’s jurisdiction, as the constitution clearly states. The federal department is managing the roads with the understanding that the local governments are not efficient at maintaining them for now. If a local unit wants to maintain a certain road section on its own, the department should allow it without any dispute. Both sides showed childish behaviour while handling the New Road case. \nCPN (Unified Socialist) leader Ram Kumari Jhakri was among the most active leaders involved in the formation of the party after split with the CPN-UML in 2021. Three years on, she is now the most vocal leader calling for a unification of the two parties. Why didn’t the new party perform well, and what made her lobby for a party merger? Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal sat with former minister Jhakri for more insights.You worked actively to form the CPN (Unified Socialist), but the party couldn’t perform well. It couldn’t even become a national party from the general elections. What went wrong?We formed the CPN (Unified Socialist) out of compulsion. When Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli—who was prime minister at the time as well—dissolved the House of Representatives in December 2020, we firmly stood against his move, saying that it sowed the seeds of political instability. We staged huge protests and moved the Supreme Court against the decision of Oli, our party chair at the time. I was among the petitioners. Once the top court reinstated the House, we expected the party to move smoothly. Unfortunately, that couldn’t happen. The party establishment led by Oli and the rival faction took extreme actions against each other. The agitating faction announced action against the party chair, and the party establishment expelled us from the party itself. When Oli dissolved the House a second time, we protested the move as it brought instability. We were in favour of transforming the party through intra-party struggle, but the situation took some unexpected turns. We didn’t quit the party with a lofty plan of making a new revolutionary organisation. We were compelled to do so.Our new party accommodated many genuine leaders who had been sidelined in the UML. But ultimately, old leaders heavily dominated the new party’s central committee. They were active leaders of their time but were out of touch with the new, changing context. Young leaders didn’t get space in party committees. I proposed recruiting at least 40 percent members under 40 years in the central committee and over 50 percent members under 30 years in the district committees. I made a 29-year-old leader the chair of the district committee in my home district. In 42 days, I attended 36 district conventions where youths in their 30s were elected district committee chairs. I tried to reach out to municipalities to promote youths in the party chapters. But at the central level, old faces dominated party committees. That didn’t attract people to the party or impress the general public. Thus, it failed to gather steam right from the beginning.Many think that Madhav Kumar Nepal’s selection as party chief was a wrong move since he had led the UML for 15 years and become prime minister, and people didn’t find novelty in the new party. Do you think so too?Madhav Kumar Nepal has been the most active leader in the party since its inception. Whatever the party has achieved so far is because of him. But a party leader must mobilise teams with defined roles and responsibilities and continuously motivate and engage them in result-oriented tasks. He works a lot but doesn’t mobilise teams effectively. Observers say the Unified Socialist was formed due to the personality clash between top leaders and that it lacked a national agenda and a clear policy to prove the need for a new party. Do you feel so?Our immediate agenda was safeguarding the constitution and ensuring political stability in the country. We protested the House dissolution guided by the same policy. But when provincial governments were made like satellites of the federal government, we couldn’t play any role in stabilising them.The UML is guided by the policy of People’s Multiparty Democracy, propounded by the late Madan Bhandari. There was a debate on further enhancing the policy in the changed context. A large section of Left intellectuals were interested in contributing to that. We could have engaged them in the process. But our party stopped the debate on that topic as well. We missed the chance of engaging many critical individuals in the discourse and having a relatively different policy. When in the UML, we practised direct elections of party representatives and leaders from the conventions. Unfortunately, leaders of the new party, Unified Socialist, made a statute that gave powers to the party leadership to nominate party secretariat, office bearers and other members. Leaders would pick those who are loyal to them. This regressive approach killed competition in the party.You are known to prefer a more proactive work and decision-making approach. There are rumours that you have been fed up with the party’s lacklustre style and are mulling to join the mother party, UML.If I were to decide only from a personal perspective, I would have done so much earlier because I had multiple opportunities in the past. But I am for party merger because I don’t see any relevance of running multiple retail shops under communist banners because we are not substantially different from each other in terms of policies. Our electoral system has also made it necessary. The Unified Socialist can’t run like this. We must accept reality and decide—merging our party with the UML is better than running it this way. But it seems that the top leaders of the twin parties are still bitter about each other.True, the bitterness lingers on, mainly among the top leaders. We have also made some mistakes. The UML offered some opportunities to the Unified Socialist, and we should have made some offers to capitalise on the favourable situation. At one time, UML leaders proposed our party chair as a candidate for the vacant post of the country’s President. We should have devised our own proposal and made a win-win deal. But we ran away and squandered the opportunity. If Madhav Kumar Nepal had become president on the UML’s proposal, our party might have been reunited with the UML much earlier. I also took an initiative to that end but in vain. Later also, UML chair Oli visited our party chair’s residence to have our party on board the government. But the reaction from our side ruined things. We are certainly not responding to the UML responsibly. Rather than irritate the UML, we must turn each positive gesture into an opportunity for party unity.One more factor is blocking the unity between the two parties. There are a large number of second-rung leaders in the UML who can’t directly confront Oli. They are now encouraging former President Bidya Devi Bhandari to join active politics and trying to make decisions in their favour through her. Oli knows these leaders will support Nepal when he returns to the UML. Why would he [Oli] then merge the fringe party and create another power centre against himself? He knows Madhav Kumar Nepal will challenge him with the backing of the dissidents. It is natural for a leader to think twice before allowing another leader of your stature to create a parallel power centre within the organisation. Even I would have thought twice. This is a major factor hindering party unity.Your party chair and other key leaders seem quite close to CPN (Maoist Centre) chair Pushpa Kamal Dahal and critical of UML chair Oli. Moreover, Oli often lambasts Madhav Kumar Nepal publicly. Will they still merge the parties?In principle, our party is open for unity with any Left party. But party cadres won’t join the Maoist Centre. If our leadership decides to merge the party with the Maoists, a huge number of our party cadres will join the UML. Unity between the UML and the Unified Socialist is natural because we grew up in the same background and orientation. But we are quite different from Maoists. Several groups trying to form new political outfits have failed to emerge as a major political force and sustain themselves. You worked in a big party for years and also helped establish a new one. What are the challenges of forming a new political organisation in Nepal?Political parties sustain if they evolve with society. If you trace the history of the Nepal’s Congress and communist parties, you will see how they have evolved over the past seven decades. They competed against each other but joined hands to fight autocratic forces towards establishing democracy. They have done hundreds of progressive things in society. Their major fault is that they have multiple entry points but no exit policy. The only exit way is the death of the leaders. This has caused unhealthy practices and created dissident groups.The dissidents who didn’t get any space within their party formed new outfits. They also amplified negative narratives against the old parties. It happened with the Congress, the UML and the Maoist Centre. Had there been an exit system in the party, the situation wouldn’t be this bad. But new political parties can’t sustain without their own political ideology and orientation. You may form an organisation, cash in on people’s frustration and achieve some immediate gains, but outfits can’t sustain.But recent electoral trends show that Nepalis are seeking alternative forces and new faces. Can we be oblivious to that?You are right. We have seen such trends in the Panchayat system as well. But garnering votes during elections for one term and establishing a sustainable political force are two different things.  \nThe CPN (Maoist Centre) has either led or been a part of the government for most of the past decade and half. But the most recent Maoist Centre-led government under Pushpa Kamal Dahal was ousted only last month. Following this, the party’s senior leaders are in marathon meetings. The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal asked Giriraj Mani Pokharel, the Maoist Centre deputy general secretary, on the party’s review of the turn of events and its future strategy. The Maoist Centre is now out of the government. How does the party intend to go forward? We have started a series of party meetings to review the overall situation and to set the party’s agenda. We held a meeting of the office bearers that ran for five days. Now the party’s standing committee meeting is underway. After this, there will be a central committee meeting. That will take the final decisions on the party’s strategy and programmes for the coming days. In the meetings, the party chair has asked the leaders to discuss national as well as party issues frankly and honestly. At the end of the meeting, we will make an objective analysis of the overall situation and prepare an action plan.The Central Committee endorses the decisions. But the meetings of the office bearers and standing committee set the agenda and orientation for the party. What have you decided so far? On the national front, obviously, the dissolution of our government and formation of a new alliance is an issue. Leaders of the new coalition have said their alliance is for making changes in the constitution. They however are still not transparent. Based on their statements, it can be said that they are going against their own pledges. During the election campaign, they had said nothing about changing the constitution. You don’t find it in their manifestos as well. But in the middle of this five-year tenure, they have come up with a new agenda. A question arises: Can they change the constitution? Doesn’t that violate the mandate the parties got through the elections? Generally, the constitution might be reviewed after 10 years of its implementation. But we haven’t implemented it in a full-fledged way as we don’t even have all the laws required for its effective implementation. We have just agreed to conclude the remaining tasks of the peace process. So, the proposal to amend the constitution without first completing the basics required for its implementation is wrong. They want to make changes in the proportional inclusive system of our constitution. A political force can work to secure a majority in the House through general elections and ensure stability in the country. We accept that. We have also been lobbying for a directly elected executive president for political stability. They are not ready to debate on that. But they want to revoke the inclusive system, a major achievement of the 2006 people’s movement. This system has empowered historically excluded and deprived communities. We have to enhance the capacity of these groups instead of depriving them of their rights. If there are anomalies in the system’s implementation, let’s develop methods to more effectively pick our representatives. But the ruling parties seem intent on turning back the clock. Some leaders have publicly announced that they want to end the role of small parties. There can be a number of political parties in a country like Nepal, which is rich in social diversity. We adopted federalism for the same purpose. The leaders give priority to their family members and loyal ones while selecting election candidates and blame the constitution for the ensuing mistakes. They want to rule the country indefinitely through a two-party system. So we think the Congress-UML alliance is on the path of regression. Republicanism, federalism, secularism, inclusion and socialism-oriented systems are integrated five pillars of the present constitution. No attack on them will be tolerated. This is one focus of our ongoing meeting. We are also discussing some fresh international issues such as the developments in Bangladesh. We have yet to get a complete picture from there. But we can still learn some things. The centre of global affairs is changing and shifting to Asia. More importantly, there is a strong influence of such geopolitical forces in Nepal as well.Party chair Pushpa Kamal Dahal has said that there was an external hand in the recent change of coalition.External elements are active, in one way or the other. Some want to make our country a playground of external forces but our party and party chair firmly stood against it. The forces that wanted various things but didn’t get them from the government then started searching for a character suitable for them. People aren’t aware of such unseen elements but we should be careful. In the meeting, we are discussing this issue as well.Do you think geopolitics is the major reason for the ouster of the Dahal-led government?In his third term as a prime minister, Prachanda was working with certain priorities such as good governance, social justice and prosperity. He had taken governance seriously. Previously, there was a practice of exploiting state coffers in collusion between politicians, big businessmen and bureaucrats. The Prachanda-led government strongly stood against such a nexus. Actions against those involved in Bhutanese refugee scam, Lalita Niwas land grab, Bansbari Leather Shoe land scam, and gold smuggling are some examples. The government formulated a law to address the problems of loan shark victims. But some individuals associated with the coalition partners were involved in the scams. Were these bad elements linked to the Congress or the UML? Dahal entered into coalitions with both.The individuals were linked to partners in both the coalitions. The party chair made good governance his main priority but the Maoist Centre is the third-largest party so his hands were tied. When certain individuals were brought under investigation in corruption cases, the initiatives to change the government were expedited overnight. We can conclude that Prachanda government’s anti-corruption moves inspired other parties to oust it.You mentioned external interference as well as other parties’ fear of the government’s anti-corruption actions. Which one was the major reason for government change?The government’s anti-corruption drive is the main reason behind the formation of the new coalition. This drive brought the two largest parties together to form a government, which is unusual in the parliamentary system. The government is working to increase the threshold to secure seats under the proportional representation category. The proposed provision is against small parties, and the Maoist Centre has opposed this. Do you see the possibility of polarisation among the parties on this issue?When the ruling parties introduce new proposals that were not even discussed during the elections, we will definitely oppose them. We led the previous movements for people’s rights and we have to secure these rights. Thus the polarisation between those who want to trample on the statute and those who are against such attacks is inevitable. Is the Maoist Centre preparing to unify with other parties including the Nepal Communist Party led by Netra Bikram Chand Biplab?First, we are in the final stage of merging with the outfit of Mahindra Raya Yadav. Also, the Biplab-led party has endorsed the party unity proposal. We have to iron out some theoretical issues and make the party line clear in the changed national as well as international context. Dialogue between us is headed in the right direction.You earlier said party chair has urged other leaders to openly debate issues. Have they discussed why the Maoist party has lost its strength as well as the issue of the party chair holding leadership continuously for three and a half decades.Comrade Prachanda led the decade-long people’s war and subsequent political movements as well as the peace process, all of which made epochal changes in Nepal’s political history. No one can deny this. Therefore, Prachanda doesn’t need any position in the party. He is now a nationally as well as internationally established personality. But our party as well as the country needs him. Therefore, the discussions in the party are now aimed at making the best use of his personality in the larger interest of the society. As far as the reasons behind the setbacks we faced in the recent time are concerned, we had rightly assessed the situation in the past.But we couldn’t adapt to the changed context. We failed to develop our culture and lifestyle in line with our guiding ideology. Similarly, we failed to run the party in a proper way. We gave up our agendas and became power-centric. We developed anti-proletariat tendencies. We were gradually distanced from the public. Now we have decided that we must reestablish our relations with the working class and the oppressed. We have also failed to communicate about the important works we did when we were in the government. We need to tell the people what we did in their favour when we were in government in the past 15 years. There will also be some serious soul-searching.There is a perception that the Maoist Centre and its leaders are incapable of staying out of power.Our party’s general convention had decided to maintain a right balance in the party’s role in the government, Parliament and the street. It is true that we were in the past more engaged in the government. The party chair has already said that our focus won’t be the government from now on. \nAjaya Dixit’s current work focuses on studying challenges of building resilience across boundaries and at sub-national scales. He has studied and written extensively on water resources, trans-boundary water cooperation, flood management, wash services and climate change adaptation, clean energy transition and related policy studies. In this interview with the Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal, Dixit discusses river management in Nepal’s urban areas: Where have we gone wrong in this endeavour and what can we do? You have extensively studied river systems and have been following changes seen in river basins. How do you see recent problems caused by encroachment and rampant development activities?We humans have lived and have to continue to live within water cycles: water evaporates from the ocean to the sky and then precipitates to the land and flows via rivers back to the ocean. Rivers that function as arteries of the land surface, sustaining humans, aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems face widespread abuses: pollution, rampant extraction of their bed and banks, fragmentation and degradation. Without rivers, we would not be who we are. Unfortunately, we have forgotten this essence. We neglect and abuse rivers. In 1981, just after the monsoon ended, I, along with my students, walked from Sundarijal to Teku studying Bagmati rivers’ sediment. At many places, we walked on the riverbed. The river then was clean. Gradually, the river systems began to face all-round decay. I have read painful accounts of my contemporaries who remember swimming in the clean Bagmati and its tributaries. In less than 50 years, our rivers in Kathmandu Valley and other basins no longer look like rivers. I feel helpless and ache with pain at this collective failure! What state of rivers are we passing on to our next generation?River encroachment is common across Nepal but more serious in urban areas, including in Kathmandu. How can this be stopped?Our approach to rivers is an imitation of the trend common across South Asia, or the subcontinent, which is again largely based on the knowledge system developed in the industrialised Global North without contextualising locally. The region features waterscapes of high and punctuated rainfall during the monsoon months, rivers, wetlands, ponds, and springs, all connected with groundwater aquifers in one of the most complex landscapes of the world: the Himalaya-Ganga region. Yet, current development endeavours subjugate water rather than respect and live with it. In 2022, the Indus River in Pakistan faced major floods with devastating consequences. Referring to these floods, a group of global scientists stated that “the impacts [of the floods] were the outcome of an outdated river management system.” This approach is primarily based on building of physical structures such as buildings, bridges and roads close to rivers interfering with their natural flows. The approach that began in the early twentieth century keeps marching on even while we are facing twenty first century water challenges.There is an increasing trend of building corridor roads along the rivers in Kathmandu as well as other places. Is this a good or bad practice? In Nepal, road building in the hills has earned the sobriquet of “dozer roads,” meaning politically designed roads excavated by heavy machine operators without adhering to basic engineering, social, environmental, or hydrological safeguards. Even highways built with “engineering,” such as the Mugling-Narayanghat section, face regular accidents. The sliding of the two buses in the Trishuli is the recent example. Building roads along the banks of rivers, defined as “river corridors,” is the preferred approach for improving connectivity. In the Kathmandu Valley, this is also associated with rivers shackled within concrete walls in the name of river beautification. In the monsoon, however, they all overflow as we have been seeing in the last few years and this year as well.What will happen to these rivers 10-15 years down the line? Is there any chance of some of our rivers dying? Or, will the measures taken in recent times protect them?All rivers must flow clean and free in selected stretches. But today, rivers are disconnected with their floodplains. Within walls and embankments, they have become conduits of filth. Many rivers are already seriously degraded. If the current trend continues, many rivers may die. I remember Jacques-Yves Cousteau, the French oceanographer, filmmaker, and author, who wrote: “Water and air, the two essential fluids on which all life depends, have become global garbage cans.” Our current efforts at conserving, developing and managing rivers are grossly inadequate. During the Covid-19 pandemic, we saw some rivers heal as human actions across the board ceased due to the lockdown. But this healing came at huge human and economic costs. The lessons, however, are clear. We must stop turning rivers into garbage cans for them to begin to heal. The onus lies on us, our activities, our governance, and the policies we make and put into practice effectively. We need new ways of imagining rivers in harmony with human needs. Otherwise, the rivers will die. If rivers die, what will become of us?What problems may city dwellers face as a result of this continued destruction of rivers?A 2020 analysis of rivers in Nepal found that the quality of rivers in the mid-hills and the Tarai are already deteriorating. Industries, cities, towns, and agriculture produce waste that, when disposed of in rivers untreated, cause pollution. Solid and liquid wastes produced by expanding cities and towns pollute nearby rivers, streams, and water bodies. Pollution kills aquatic life such as fish, which are sources of livelihood for many communities. Polluted rivers and water bodies degrade human and environmental health, leading to negative impacts on human livelihoods. The impacts of pollution on rivers are considerable during non-monsoon months when river discharge, and consequently the capacity of rivers to dilute waste, are low.What should be done to conserve the rivers, at least in the present form, and stop further damages?All rivers are a combination of water (W), energy (E), biodiversity aquatic (B), and sediment (S), represented by the acronym WEBS. In the current scheme of things, the focus is on water and energy. Aquatic ecosystems are the concern of only those working on freshwater ecosystems. They are neglected in the larger context though the state has made some provisions for conserving ecosystems. In Nepal’s Hydropower Development Policy of 2001 all hydropower plants must release 10 percent minimum flow to the downstream reaches to enable fish and other aquatic life to survive in the river. A 2021 study of 50 hydropower plants however found that none of the plants surveyed release environmental-flows. All hydropower plants, as per their power purchasing agreements, are required to produce maximum power during the dry season. We should start by accepting the fact that rivers need clean flowing water and respecting the policies we have made. Then we must systematically introduce changes and avoid the oversights embedded in the present approach. The present approach to water development and management focused on engineering and structural solutions is based on single-disciplinary education that is blind to gender and social inclusion challenges and aquatic ecosystems. In the present approach, nobody seems to want sediment which is a natural consequence of flow within the water cycle.To meet such an objective, we need to begin with a system of integrated knowledge that synthesises natural science, social science, and indigenous practices. By incorporating fields such as hydrology, ecology, social science-supported context-specific engineering, and indigenous knowledge and practices, we can take a comprehensive approach to water management challenges and solutions. Interdisciplinary approaches can build collaboration, innovation, and systemic decision-making and promote innovative water management for the benefit of both ecosystems and human societies.Do you think initiatives such as river clean up campaigns run by various groups help protect these waterways?I see such initiatives as manifestation of dissatisfaction of concerned citizens with the degradation of rivers and to bring about changes. In 1990, I was part of the Save Bagmati Campaign, which aimed to highlight the degrading state of the river. This campaign has taken many new forms, and citizen groups have begun campaigns in other rivers of Nepal. They however remain fragmented and ad-hoc. Similar campaigns in some countries have led to granting rights to rivers. In 2017, New Zealand recognised the Whanganui River and its tributaries as legal entities, acknowledging their physical and spiritual significance as “living and indivisible” and ensuring their survival, health, and integrity to balance the needs of humans and nature. Promulgations like Living Indus (Pakistan), Namami Gange river-improvement programme (India) can offer lessons for a holistic water journey. The collective voice of concerned citizens for the integrity of rivers can be a powerful medium for policy and pathway changes. Nepal must also begin country-wide river restoration initiatives. We need more dialogue and conversation around water challenges and solutions.As cities turn into concrete jungles, their water tables are said to be receding alarmingly. You often propose redesigning our settlements and development infrastructure in a way that wouldn’t disturb rivers’ natural courses and catchment areas. Could you elaborate?South Asia is a region of waterscapes containing streams, ponds, wetlands, open spaces, floodplains, springs, and underground aquifers. Yet, our towns, cities, and infrastructure are planned, designed, and built to disregard water rather than live with it. As land-centric urban growth dominates, waterscapes temporarily seem to vanish but later water comes back. In Nepali we have a saying “In twelve years a stream returns”. The present practice of urban development is obsessed with concretisation, making these areas impermeable. Rainwater, part of which would naturally infiltrate the ground, now immediately reaches the rivers already constrained by walls. The river at a downstream section immediately peaks and when the rainfall stops the river has very low discharge. Basic parameters, like the intensity of rainfall (mm per hour), are poorly recognised and used in design guidelines. The interaction of current urbanisation practices and increasing extreme rainfall, temperature and humidity rise spawned by climate change and urban heat island effects will make our urban areas as crucible of hazards, and unhealthy. A new urban future must harmoniously integrate nature, including water bodies and wetlands, and preserve natural land cover, including traditional ponds to promote groundwater recharge. It can be further achieved by preserving green open spaces, forests, gardens, permeable “sponge” pavements, and natural waterfronts for healthier communities in sustainable cities. The starting point will be recognising cities as waterscapes. Amplified mitigation of emissions of greenhouse gases at global levels remains a critical imperative in this new future. The major impacts of climate change are evident through the water cycle. Squatters settled along the riverbanks are taken as one of the major headaches in preserving rivers’ catchment areas. How can this issue be resolved?The squatters and migrants to urban regions are outcomes of the present-day political economy of development. People move to cities seeking livelihood, education, and opportunities to move up the social ladder. These groups who end up living in high-risk areas are sometimes also seen as political vote banks. This issue needs to be viewed within the larger development question including generation of local employment, new livelihood opportunities and addressing insecurities of water, food, health, and education.Recently the Supreme Court asked authorities to make septic tank and soak pit mandatory while approving building designs in order to help recharge groundwater, and a recent Cabinet meeting has banned building any structure within 40 metres on both sides of major rivers in Kathmandu, Do such measures help keep the rivers alive or is that too little too late?Such decisions, in some way, seem to underscore the notion of giving space to rivers and maintaining their integrity. Building of septic tanks as part and parcel of new houses began in the 1970s as primary treatment units that can prevent the direct dumping of human waste into rivers and water bodies. The regular cleaning and safe disposal of waste from septic tanks are emerging questions. Rivers and waterscapes face much deeper challenges, however. The present water development model marches on like a mighty tusker, trampling in its path communities, villagers, residents, natural ecosystems, the terrestrial and aquatic beings, and past memories. Turning that around will require those working on water and river integrity across geographical, social, disciplinary and political boundaries to join hands in seeking changes and laying the foundation for a new ethical social contract for rivers and waterscapes as a first step in that long journey. \nWithin days of CPN-UML chair KP Sharma Oli and Nepali Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba reaching a deal to form a new government under Oli’s leadership, some Congress leaders including the two party general secretaries started doubting the deal’s implementation. Independent observers also have doubts over the longevity of the Congress-UML partnership. To get some insight, the Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal sat down with Congress Central Committee member Govind Raj Pokharel, who is also former vice-chair of National Planning Commission. Many have expressed doubt over the longevity of the Congress-UML alliance. What is your observation?There was a discussion in the political circles on the need for the Congress and the UML joining hands to address some serious problems the country has been facing for years. The issues of governance, flaws seen in the practice of the electoral system, and the national economy are some pressing issues that need to be addressed. In the meantime, the top leaders of the two largest parties reached a deal overnight. The dramatic turn of events made people suspect some unspoken reasons had brought the leaders of the two rival forces together. The leaders have stated that they joined hands mainly to review the constitution, to make changes in the electoral system, improve governance and address problems seen in the economic sector. These are the stated objectives. As far as my observation goes, people don’t have full faith in the leaders of the two parties because of past records. On the economic front, this coalition may achieve some improvements because both parties are on the same page. Both follow liberal economic ideas. Of late, even the UML has become increasingly liberal on economic issues. The private sector has welcomed the new alliance. There are already some signs of reforms. Their plan to make changes in the electoral system through constitutional amendment however is not easy. First, their numerical strength in the federal parliament, mainly in the upper house, is insufficient to amend the constitution. Such a move would be risky from a strategic perspective as well. Many groups and forces have reservations over various provisions of this constitution. Once they start the amendment process, it will be like opening Pandora’s Box. Thus I am optimistic only on the economic front. If they get that right, it will help address the society’s mass frustration.The two parties have cited the perennial political instability as a major reason behind their coming together. Can we now expect policy consistency as well?Political instability is an excuse to cover up their failures. Even the alliance of largest parties cannot guarantee political or policy stability. Numbers alone are not enough. Leaders also need to have a democratic culture and the capacity to manage emerging issues. Even governments led by a single party commanding up to two-thirds majority have failed. On certain occasions, coalition governments have done commendable jobs. Handling the post-quake situation and producing the constitution in 2015 were examples of big parties justifying their coalition. Thus even with some doubt, we can expect political stability and some economic reforms.The Congress unanimously endorsed the deal of party president Sher Bahadur Deuba and CPN-UML chair KP Sharma Oli. But in public, leaders from the anti-establishment faction of the Congress don’t seem satisfied. Why this unease?The deal was made in a dramatic way without proper consultations with other leaders. At least those in the executive committees of the party should have been consulted. It is challenging for the Congress leaders to ally with their major rival, the UML. A cadre-based party, the UML’s style of governance is different to that of the Congress. When in government, the UML treats even government institutions, constitutional bodies and independent agencies as the party’s structures. Whereas the Congress allows more freedom to government agencies. So, there is a risk of the UML misusing state mechanisms while the Congress leaders are in the Cabinet. This is one big risk for the Congress. The second concern is the working style of Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli. He is a towering personality, a hard-working leader, and with his strong command over his party organisation, he can swiftly implement any proposal. The Congress ministers who also have to listen to the concerns of the party’s top leaders may struggle to strike a balance. In Oli’s Cabinet, ministers are likely to get less freedom within their ministries. A rift is thus likely because of Prime Minister Oli’s working style.Why didn’t the Congress then send influential leaders to the Cabinet to check the prime minister?The leaders might not have been so interested in joining this government. They might have sensed intervention from the prime minister’s office and thought they might not be able to perform as per their expectation under Oli’s leadership. See, chiefs of the Congress, the UML and the Maoist Centre work in a dictatorial way. Once they are elected at the party convention for four years, they behave like dictators. They take decisions on their own without any consultations. People in Nepal often lobby for a directly-elected prime minister or President. I wonder what these leaders would do if they were directly elected as executive head. So, the problem is in the working style and attitude of our leaders, not in the constitution or the electoral system.Shekhar Koirala and Gagan Thapa had first pitched for joining hands with the UML to end ‘unnecessary bargaining’ of fringe parties. Suddenly, Deuba struck the deal with Oli. And, now Koirala and Thapa seem sceptical about the deal.The proposal of Koirala and Thapa was for Congress leading the government and the UML supporting it. In fact, Oli was ready to accept Congress leadership. He requested the Congress leaders to take the lead. Surprisingly, the negotiating team led by our party president reached an opposite deal. They offered government leadership to Oli.Then, could it be that, as some claim, Deuba and his wife Arzu were desperate to unseat Dahal fearing they could be dragged into corruption scams?I don’t know much about that scenario. But what I knew is that Oli was willing to join a Congress-led government.Why would Deuba, who is a very clever leader in making such give-and-take deals, have given up a chance to be prime minister right away?It’s true that all three party chiefs—Deuba, Oli and Dahal—are very clever in making deals in their own favour based on their numerical strength. A leader beats the other two on one occasion and on another, another of them comes out on top. It’s like a see-saw. This time Oli won the game.Congress General Secretaries Gagan Thapa and Bishwa Prakash Sharma have expressed suspicion over the implementation of the deal. Many say they did so as Deuba didn’t involve them in negotiations on power-sharing. Is it true?The party’s central work execution committee endorsed the deal signed by the two leaders. The leaders who participate in such meetings should speak up then and there if there is anything objectionable, instead of making such statements in public. Why didn’t they oppose it at the meeting? I don’t see any point in expressing doubt over the deal in public while endorsing the same in party committees.The two general secretaries also expressed doubt over Oli handing over government leadership to Deuba as per the agreement. Why this mistrust?The experience of the past two or three decades makes politicians suspicious of each other. Nepali politicians have hardly ever handed over government leadership easily. After four or five months of collaboration, some issues emerge and a rift is created. So, history makes us doubt that this coalition will last for three and half years. In the meantime, the party establishments have sidelined other factions when it comes to picking ministers, both at federal and provincial levels. When the government fails to perform as per expectation, party cadres of the ruling parties start criticising the government. Is it possible to amend the constitution as the two parties have announced?We can’t backtrack on the inclusive system. We must abide by the policy of inclusion in state agencies. The leaders who spoiled this system are saying that the proportional representation (PR) system is not working. But there is room to make our three-tier federal system more cost-effective. People get irritated when they see a large number of representatives benefitting from state coffers. We can bring down the number of local units from 753 to around 400. However, there should be sufficient wards as those units are directly involved in service delivery while the Palikas are more engaged in development activities. The number of ward members can also be decreased. In provinces, we don’t need PR seats as those elected from the provincial constituencies automatically represent the local communities. Likewise, the provincial cabinets can be downsized. Thus we can downsize the number of people who benefit from state coffers. This is vital to make the federal system sustainable. Similarly, we can rightsize the number of PR seats by adopting a rotational constituency for women, dalits and other marginalised communities. Only the candidates from underrepresented sections will compete in those constituencies. This will help elect competent people even from within the targeted communities. This is how we can address some concerns without compromising the inclusive system envisioned in the constitution.Why has the Congress picked gangsters and tainted individuals as ministers in provinces?The selection of such controversial individuals as ministers and policy makers will damage the party’s image. People are going to raise this issue seriously. In fact the pace of criminalisation and commercialisation of Nepali politics is faster than the political reform being undertaken to clean up politics.It seems intellectual leaders are being sidelined while gangsters are being promoted. Why is it happening?Because people from intellectual or political backgrounds voice critical views and leaders don’t like it. They speak what their conscience says is right. For instance, leaders like Mahesh Acharya and Minendra Rijal aren’t given any role in the party. It is a common problem in all the major political forces in Nepal.Is the space for leaders with intellectual backgrounds and having critical views being squeezed?The Congress used to be a very liberal organisation. But it has also become illiberal and leaders have become increasingly intolerant. All leaders—whether the seniors or young ones—are becoming less tolerant even of constructive criticism. Party leaders haven’t spoken against the selection of gangsters as ministers. Even the office bearers who are in decision making bodies and can change the decisions are silent now. This is dangerous. This is an example of how critical voices are sidelined.Haven’t the two young general secretaries been able to raise hope in the Congress?They are working like central committee members. General secretaries should be able to intervene while making crucial policy decisions. They can stop the party committees from making wrong decisions. But they are risk-averse. They are not taking the risk to fight the powerful party establishment.Historically, in all parties there is a trend of its anti-establishment faction bargaining for 40-45 percent seats in the party or government. If they don’t get an acceptable power sharing deal, they don’t cooperate with the party leadership. Is it a healthy democratic practice?Intra-party competition compels the leaders to do this. The ruthless establishment always sidelines party members and leaders if they aren’t loyal. So, the leadership of the anti-establishment has to protect such cadres because the rival factor too needs a strong support base of cadres to compete against the powerful establishment. Party establishments are strong due to centralised resources and other factors, so you need an equally strong force to compete against them. \nThe Meteorological Forecasting Division has predicted partly to generally cloudy conditions across Nepal on Monday, with light to moderate rain accompanied by thunder and lightning likely in a few places across all provinces.

Though still a developing nation, Nepal was a land of profound beauty and deep-rooted cultural heritage. The residents of Nepal faced many challenges, but beneath these hardships lay a resilient spirit and an unyielding hope for the future.\n\nThis enchanting land, where Mount Everest reaches towards the skies and the air carries a mix of incense and cool mountain breezes, was more than a geographical marvel. It was a mosaic of cultures, languages, and traditions, a testament to human endeavor against all odds. Nepal's history, from the unification under King Prithvi Narayan Shah to its transformation into a federal democratic republic, told a story of aspiration and endurance.\n\nIn recent years, the people of Nepal, with their indomitable will, had taken strides towards rebuilding and reimagining their country. They turned their struggles into stepping stones, each challenge a chapter in their ongoing saga. The shift from a monarchy to a republic had not only changed governance but had woven a new tapestry of democratic values and collective decision-making.\n\nEconomically, while agriculture continued to sustain a large part of its population, Nepal had begun to harness the potential of its picturesque landscapes, developing sustainable tourism that promised to preserve their natural heritage while boosting local economies. Communities living in the shadows of the Himalayas had become stewards of the earth, protecting the biodiversity that made their country unique.\n\nEach day brought new stories. Whether it was a festival in Kathmandu, a technological advance in Pokhara, or a conservation effort in Chitwan, these events were threads in the vibrant quilt of Nepali life. These stories, updated daily, reflected the pulse of progress and the spirit of hope that characterized this resilient nation.\n\nAnd so, as Nepal moved forward, each moment was not just a passage of time but a promise of potential, a narrative of a nation perennially climbing towards tomorrow, guided by the legacy of its past and the dreams of its future.\n\nNews events:\nPrime Minister KP Oli has said Nepal will pursue a balanced foreign policy with both neighbours and will not play the card against each other. The prime minister said countries can be big or small, but their sovereignty is equal. He made the comment at the launch of a book titled “Geopolitics and Blockade” authored by Rastriya Prajatantra Party Nepal Chairman Kamal Thapa in Kathmandu on Monday.Thapa, who served as foreign minister during the Indian blockade of Nepal in 2015 when Oli was the prime minister, has recounted his experiences in the book. India imposed a months-long blockade against Nepal, expressing dissatisfaction over certain provisions of the constitution, which was promulgated in September 2015.During this period, Thapa negotiated with India and sought international support at the United Nations General Assembly. Speaking at the function, Oli dismissed the idea of ‘geopolitics’ as an absolute concept in Nepal’s context. “Geopolitics is about safeguarding our legitimate national interests. We have to clearly communicate our concerns and positions to our neighbours because we don’t play one against the other. We want to be a good neighbour, not a bad one,” said Oli.The prime minister said Nepal wants the same treatment from its neighbours as it extends to them. “We should not tilt to one side, and we have to maintain neutrality in our relations.” This was probably the first time that Prime Minister Oli spoke in detail about Nepal’s foreign policy in general and the neighbourhood in particular.“ We will not allow our soil to be used against any neighbour. We are very much mindful of the ongoing uncertainties in geopolitics. We are in favour of world peace and sensitive to the well-being of our citizens,” said the prime minister.Reflecting on the 2015-16 Indian blockade, Oli said: “We did not surrender. We suffered a lot, and so did our people, but every action we took was in the nation’s best interest.”The prime minister expressed scepticism about the frequent use of the term “geopolitics,” suggesting it has become a convenient excuse for avoiding responsibility.“If we want to hide our weaknesses, if we fail to resolve any issue or fail to give adequate attention to any subject, then it has become easy to blame geopolitics.”“But beyond that, we have to look into our traditional, cultural and social relations. We have to balance our relations. People may say whatever they like, but we must break this habit [of blaming geopolitics]. We have two neighbours, and oftentimes, relations may fluctuate, but we cannot change our neighbours,\" said the prime minister, suggesting that talks and dialogue are the ways to resolve any misunderstanding that arise.After the Indian blockade, Oli capitalised on nationalist sentiments, visited China, and signed a trade and transit agreement, which is widely regarded as a landmark decision.To lessen Nepal’s dependency on India for bilateral and third-country trade, Nepal and China signed the trade and transit agreement in 2016, granting Nepal access to seven land and sea ports for third-country trade. Despite this agreement’s initial hype, just two cargo shipments have been made between Nepal and third countries through China in the last eight years. Thapa, the author of the book, urged the prime minister to fully utilise the transit routes provided by China. “We don’t have any production to export,” said the prime minister. “That’s why progress has been slower than expected.”Oli also signed another agreement with India, focussing on using waterways, mainly cross-border rivers, for transit.\"We reached a transit agreement for using Indian waterways for both bilateral and third-country trade. We did this agreement considering our ties with India. For the country’s justified interest and well-being, we must speak up and ensure our national interests are aligned with international accountability,\" said Oli. Oli also talked about the delay by India in receiving the report of the Eminent Persons Group on Nepal-India relations. The group was formed in 2016 with a mandate to review the Nepal-India relations in a changed global and regional context. The report prepared by eight members from both sides, has been gathering dust since 2018. \"Modiji and I spoke and formed the EPG. I don’t know the reason why the Indian side has been hesitant to receive the report. It was agreed that the report would be presented to the Indian prime minister first, and then to the Nepali side…Not receiving the report is not good, India should accept it. It covers everything from the 1950s Peace and Friendship Treaty to our entire bilateral ties.\"On boundary matters, the prime minister said that both sides should rely on facts and evidence. The key boundary dispute between Nepal and India centres around the Kalapani area and the mouth of the Mahakali River. Nepal claims that the river originates at Limpiyadhura, while India disputes it. \"If there’s a confusion, we should refer to the Treaty of Sugauli. We can resolve the dispute through facts and evidence. If necessary we can negotiate, but dialogue must continue,\" said Oli. Nepal-India relations had hit rock bottom when the Oli government in 2020 published a new map in response to an Indian map issued in November, 2019. The boundary issue remains unresolved with both sides maintaining a status quo.Former minister Thapa recalled the events during the 2015-16 Indian blockade, reflecting on his visits to India, meetings with Modi and former external affairs minister of India Sushma Swaraj and others in an attempt to resolve the tensions between Nepal and India. “Our differences stem mainly from geopolitics, security, and strategic concerns,” said Thapa. He urged the prime minister to work to align with India on these fronts to achieve progress in bilateral relations.Thapa also praised Oli for his tough stance during the Indian blockade and his bold move to sign landmark agreements with China. He urged the prime minister to clear up misunderstandings with India and effectively implement the agreements signed with China during the blockade. Senior journalist Yubaraj Ghimire had offered a critical overview of the book and highlighted some past incidents related to India and China. He gave examples of how Nepal's foreign policy was handled and why it went wrong in several contexts.  \nOver 3,500 people across the country have been infected with scrub typhus since mid-July, the start of this fiscal year.Officials at the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division say they expect more cases in the coming days as the disease typically peaks in September.“Like in previous years, hundreds of people have also been infected with scrub typhus this year,” said Dr Gokarna Dahal, chief of vector Control Section at the division. “More people can get infected in the coming days, as the peak season is still ahead.”Scrub typhus, or bush typhus, is an infectious disease caused by the parasite Orientia tsutsugamushi, a mite-borne bacterium. It spreads in humans when bitten by infected chiggers (larval mites) found in mice.Until a few years ago, it was believed that people residing in rural areas or those working in grasslands or fields were at high risk. However, urban populations are also now being affected by the disease.“Over 100 people from Hetauda Sub-metropolitan city have been infected from Scrub typhus this year,” said Krishna Bahadur Major, chief of the Health Office, Makawanpur. “Although more cases are reported in villages, urban areas are not immune, with several positive cases emerging there as well.”Doctors point out high fever, headache, abdominal pain, backache, joint and muscle pain, red rash, nausea and vomiting as some of the symptoms of scrub typhus infection. Patients with severe illness may develop bleeding which could lead to organ failure. The infection can lead to respiratory distress, inflation of brain, lungs, kidney failure and then multi-organ failure. If not treated immediately, it could be fatal.Nepal saw a surge in scrub typhus cases after the calamitous 2015 earthquakes that killed nearly 9,000 persons across the country.Three months after the quakes, the BP Koirala Institute of Health Sciences, Dharan, alerted the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division about six children with unusual fevers and severe respiratory problems.Serum samples were collected for subsequent tests in Kathmandu and Bangkok, which confirmed a scrub typhus outbreak. By then, four children had already died in the course of the treatment. By the end of the year, 101 cases were confirmed in 16 districts, and four more people succumbed to the disease.The magnitude of the outbreak escalated in 2016 when 831 cases of scrub typhus were reported in 47 districts, and 14 people died by the end of that year.According to the Ministry of Health and Population data, more than 1,026 people were infected with the disease in 2020. Their number increased to 1,999 in 2021, and it rose to more than 2,900 in 2022.In 2023, over 5,000 people were infected with the deadly disease. Doctors say the risk of severity and fatality can be minimised if the patients are diagnosed and treated early, they say.Ordinary antibiotics, such as doxycycline and azithromycin, which are on the essential drugs list supplied by the government to health facilities across the country for free distribution, can cure the disease.However, what is concerning is that many health workers, including doctors, lack sufficient knowledge about diagnosing scrub typhus. Many health facilities also lack reagents to carry out tests for the disease.Doctors can diagnose the disease based on the symptoms, but the risk of misdiagnosis is high, as scrub typhus symptoms are similar to those of other illnesses. They warn that waiting for lab results before starting treatment could be dangerous. It can take about a week to get lab results, and by that time, if the patient is not treated can fall into a coma and suffer multi-organ failure. \nAlmost two months after concluding the party's general convention, the CPN (Unified Socialist) on Monday decided to elect its office bearers through a vote.“Discussions were held for long on whether to appoint the office bearers based on consensus or through a vote,” Jeevanram Shrestha, a leader of the party, told the Post. “Eventually the party has now decided to elect them through voting.”On the second day of the central committee meeting on Monday, the party decided to hold the election for the office bearers.The party’s election body published the two-day election schedule that started Monday. As per the timeline, nomination for the position of office bearers started on Monday while voting will start on Tuesday afternoon.The party's general convention, held in Kathmandu from June 30 to July 5, unanimously elected Madhav Kumar Nepal as chairman, Ghanashyam Bhusal general secretary, and Jhalanath Khanal as senior leader.The party’s statute mentions that it will have 21 office bearers. Since the party charter does not acknowledge the senior leader as an office bearer, the organisation now has to elect 19 office bearers to fill the vacant positions. After the general convention elected the chairman and general secretary unanimously, the office bearers were expected to be appointed based on consensus. However, party insiders said leaders close to Chairman Nepal lobbied hard to hold an election for office bearers.In a brief interview with the Post soon after being elected as party chair, Nepal had said the rest of the party secretariat also will be elected based on consensus. “We are trying to elect the secretariat members based on consensus,” Nepal had said. But, the process to elect the office bearers halted for long. When it started, the party decided to go for the election. “When the general convention was concluded in consensus, General Secretary Bhusal and senior leader Khanal were in favour of appointing the office bearers unanimously,” a party leader told the Post on the condition of anonymity. “Chairman Nepal, who commands a strong majority in the central committee, however, lobbied to elect them through voting.” The party’s central committee members will vote to elect the office bearers. At present the Unified Socialist has a 344-member central committee. A total of 93 central members were announced at the general convention held in July first week, while the remaining 251 members were selected on August 2. In the second phase, a task force comprising Chairman Nepal, senior leader Khanal and General Secretary Bhusal had finalised the names of the central members.As of Monday evening, Rajendra Pandey and Pramesh Hamal, who are close to the party chair, are preparing to contest for the post of senior vice chair position. The Khanal-Bhusal group is adopting a strategy not to field any candidate for this position and support one of them, says a party insider.“Beduram Bhusal, who became general secretary immediately after the formation of the party, was an aspirant for the post of senior vice chair,” the leader said. “However, he has agreed to support Hamal.”Chairman Nepal commands a strong majority in the party while Khanal and General Secretary Bhusal lead a separate faction. But the Nepal-led faction is divided into sub-factions which are led by Pandey and Hamal. The two leaders–Pandey and Hamal–are in a race to become the senior vice-chair. Apart from Beduram Bhusal, Hamal also has the support of senior leader Khanal, said multiple party leaders.Party insiders expect tough competition for the vice chair of the Madhesh Province as well. Ramchandra Jha and Dharmendra Prasad Sah are contesting for the position. Former deputy general secretaries Bijay Paudel, Prakash Jwala, Ganga Lal Tuladhar and Jagannath Khatiwada are contesting for the position of vice-chairs. Paudel and Jwala are from General Secretary Bhusal’s camp while Tuladhar and Khatiwada are from chairman Nepal’s camp. The party’s statute has a provision for seven vice-chairs. Likewise, former secretaries of the party, Birodh Khatiwada, Ramkumari Jhakri, Hari Prasad Parajuli, Nagendra Chaudhary, Rajendra Rai, Ambar Bahadur Thapa, Jeevan Ram Shrestha and Garima Shah, are contesting for the deputy general secretary positions.Deputy general secretary candidates Jhakri, Thapa and Khatiwada are from Nepal’s faction and are close to Rajendra Pandey’s team. Parajuli, Shrestha and Shah are close to General Secretary Bhusal. Chaudhary and Rai, though are from Nepal’s camp, try to maintain neutrality. According to party leaders, there are more than 50 aspirants for the seven positions of secretaries. The party now has to elect a senior vice-chair, seven vice chairs including one woman, four deputy general secretaries, and seven secretaries. Prior to the general convention, the party had amended its statute to increase the number of office bearers to 21, besides the senior leader.A group of CPN-UML leaders led by Nepal split the country’s largest communist party to form the CPN (Unified Socialist) on August 25, 2021. Nepal earlier served as the chief of the CPN-UML for 15 years. They split the party, protesting against UML chair KP Sharma Oli’s decision to dissolve the House of Representatives twice accusing him of trampling the new constitution and instigating political instability in the country.Following a poor performance in local and general elections in 2022, the Unified Socialist is now struggling to retain party members. In the federal and provincial elections, it failed even to secure the status of a national party. The party won only 10 seats in the 275-member House of Representatives in the general elections.Despite holding important portfolios in the federal and provincial governments, the party leaders find it difficult to stop its cadres from rejoining their old party, the UML, let alone attracting new members.  \nNADA Auto Show 2024, Nepal’s biggest automobile fair, kicks off Tuesday in Kathmandu. Electric vehicle (EV) producers and representatives are here to tap into Nepal’s booming EV market, which saw 149 percent increase in imports in the last fiscal year, which ended in mid-July. The country brought in 11,701 EVs worth Rs29.48 billion during this period. The Post caught up with Balaje Rajan, chief strategy officer and vice president for International Business of Tata Passenger Electric Mobility, who is currently in Nepal to participate in the auto show, to talk about Nepal’s EV market, ongoing competition with Chinese EVs and the company’s future plans. Excerpts: How do you observe the Nepali EV market?Nepal has taken a very progressive stance towards EVs. Roughly 85 percent of the passenger vehicle market here now consists of EVs. It's a significant market for Tata Motors because, as the market leader over the last couple of years, we aim to maintain that spot, and we also believe that our products are perfect for Nepali roads. So, I see Nepal as a very important market. I also see Nepal as one of the benchmark automotive markets in the world where EVs are driving the market.The presence of Chinese EVs in the Nepali market is increasing faster. How do you view the competition? What are your strategies for staying ahead?Chinese EVs compete everywhere in the world, including in India. Despite multiple competitors, we have constantly innovated our products, and continue to retain a significant leadership position of about 70 percent plus market share in our home country, India. So, our products are more fit for the kind of use cases people see in Nepal. Our partnership with Sipradi, which has developed charging stations and vehicle servicing ecosystems in Nepal, will be our edge. The strength of our products, plus our partnership with Sipradi, will enable us to continue our success. Given the differences in terrain and infrastructure between Nepal and India, TATA EV customers complain that the range is not as advertised. How is the company addressing the issue?We have been communicating the real-world use range and product sales at the dealership. We have to differentiate between the certified range because of the certification methodology. There is a certain ideal test condition which, for statutory or regulatory reasons, we must declare in India. So, we are careful to ensure that that reference is not taken as the real-life range in a Nepal-type condition where the terrain is very different. We are giving a real-life range indication at the point of sale through our partner Sipradi, and we will also, with our current launch and going forward, declare the real-life range in our advertisements. So that customers would know exactly what the specific range is.What is the share of TATA EV in the Nepali market? Which models are popular with customers?We have had a tremendous run for about the last twenty months or so, starting with the pro-EV policies coming into effect. We are proud to say that last year, we were the market leaders, and this year as well, we have seen very strong retail growth. We want to regain that spot. When our Nexon was initially launched, followed by Tiago, we had a very good customer response. In the fleet segment, the Express T has a very strong response. We are launching the Punch at the NADA Auto Show, which starts Tuesday, and we expect a strong response. We will continue to bring our new models here, which will continue to be loved by customers. What are your sales expectations for the auto show?We expect that everyone will come and first have a look at the Punch. It’s a unique car that delights Nepali customers because of its high ground clearance. It has a compact footprint but is spacious inside to manoeuvre it on small roads. At the same time, high-ground clearance also allows you to go outside the Valley. I expect people to come to look at it and then test drive and give us the same type of commercial success that we saw with the Tiago last year.If demand for EVs continues to grow, when do you expect EVs to replace petrol and diesel cars in the passenger car segment in Nepal?I think over the medium term, for sure, there would be a significant impact on the import of petrol and diesel cars. It is also the right thing for Nepal, considering the abundant availability of electricity and the fact that oil [fossil fuel] must be imported. I think the government's policy of switching to EVs is very positive and progressive. In the medium term, as you can see today, 83 percent of customers are buying EVs. As more EVs are on the road, you will probably see only certain specialist use cases where petrol and diesel might still be around, and EVs will become mainstream in the overall pool.How do you assess the EV infrastructure in Nepal? What are the areas for improvement?The current charging infrastructure in Nepal, supporting around 5,000-6,000 cars, are located aptly. Through our partner Sipradi, there are charging stations every 150 km, offering a combination of fast and slow chargers. Siradi has the widest and most robust network of EV chargers. I met customers earlier today [Monday], and they were all very optimistic about the existing charging infrastructure in Nepal. Of course, as the market expands, the need for more charging stations will increase, and we plan to add accordingly. More chargers could be added based on customer demand in locations where chargers are already installed. For now, the charging infrastructure is reasonable, and future expansion will depend on the growth of EVs. Do you have any plans to open an assembly unit for EVs in Nepal? Currently, we don’t have any plans, but when it comes to any assembly, it is a combination of two things. One is the demand, and the second is the extent of incentivisation. So first, in terms of demand, Nepal has shown robust EV adoption. If the market grows significantly, it could justify considering setting up local assembly. The second factor is incentives, which are very important because any investment needs to provide a return. As of now, the size of the market and prevailing regulations do not make a strong case for local assembly, but we will continue to monitor the situation. \nTen-man Bangladesh progressed into the final of the SAFF U-20 Championship after they defeated defending champions India 4-3 on penalties following a 1-1 draw at the ANFA Complex in Lalitpur on Monday.Bangladesh threw away a first-half lead from Asadul Molla to Rickey Meetei Haobam’s 75th minute equaliser and had to rely on substitute goalkeeper Md Asif’s heroics in the shootout to reach their second consecutive final.The Bengal Tigers now dream of lifting their first ever trophy of the SAFF age-group competition after coming close in 2017, 2019 and 2023.But they will have to overcome a huge challenge from a dogged and spirited Nepal. With India out of the competition, their bid for reclaiming the throne from India has now been made easy.Nepal fought back to beat Bhutan 4-1 on penalties on Sunday after their semi-final battle ended in a 1-1 draw.Only Nepal and India have won the SAFF age-group championship title since its inception in 2015, with the latter winning the last three editions. Nepal won the first two.Nepal will also be full of confidence for the title battle, having beaten Bangladesh 2-1 in the group stage, and will be aiming to reclaim the throne.For Bangladesh, it will be a grudge match, a second chance to take care of an unfinished business and write a new chapter in South Asian football history.The stakes will be high.At Satdobato, India started as favourites and were the first to threaten when Gwgwmsar Goyaray sneaked past the Bangladesh defence and charged at goal with his left-footed strike from close range but goalkeeper and captain Md Mehdi Hasan Srabon came to the rescue with a brilliant save.India kept applying pressure on Bangladesh half but struggled to find any clear chances.Bangladesh were also lacklustre but did not throw away the only chance they got as Molla pounced on a goalkeeping error from Priyansh Dubey to slam from close range—credit to Md Rabby Hossen Rahul who outsmarted Thomas Kanamoottil Cherian to send a low cross that tricked outstretching Dubey before finding the feet of Molla.India had some moments in the final minutes of the first half but could not penetrate the Bangladesh defence line.India switched to a more aggressive mode after the break and it soon started to pay dividends as Bangladesh had to survive a series of attacks.Manglenthang Kipgen curling effort almost found the inside of the net in the 52nd minute.Korou Singh Thingujam should have equalised two minutes later when he only had Srabon to beat but his shot from inside the area flashed wide.Thanglalsoun Gangte then reached twice closer to goal, testing Srabon with a powerful shot and hitting the upright.Bangladesh looked determined not to let their lead slip away easily and made a goal line clearance to deny Goyary in the 64th minute but their first choice goalkeeper Srabon had to be stretchered off after sustaining an injury while trying to foil Goyary’s effort.India took full advantage of it and squared the game in the 75th minute. Naoba Meitei Pangambam utilised the opportunity of a poor defending from Kamacai Marma Aky and cut back for Haobam to send a low ball through the crowded area, giving Asif no chance.Bangladesh received another hammer blow in the fifth minute of added time as Aky was sent off for badly challenging India goalkeeper Dubey.But Asif, who came on crisis and gave away the lead, found redemption in the shootout as he denied Gangte and Akash Tirkey to take Bangladesh into the final. \nMosquitoes are climbing Nepal’s hills and mountains, marking their presence in areas that were not their traditional habitats. Accordingly, the number of people infected by the mosquito-borne dengue virus is soaring. A mosquito-borne vector infection, dengue is mostly found in tropical and sub-tropical climates and is concentrated in urban and semi-urban areas. According to the World Health Organization, about half of the world’s population is at risk of dengue, and around 100-400 million infections occur each year. Most districts of Nepal have seen a surge in dengue infections in the past couple of years, putting ill-equipped health centres, especially in the hills, which are new to dengue, under stress. Since January of this year alone, Nepal has seen over 5,000 cases and at least three deaths. In Sankhuwasabha, the district hospital is short of beds and healthcare workers. The situation there is so precarious that people have ended up on the floor, corridor, chairs, storeroom and hospital compound. This, however, is nothing new in the country—the Covid-19 pandemic exposed our inability to handle large-scale emergencies owing to a lack of infrastructure and preparedness. The fact that a disease like dengue has reached the mountains also confirms that we are amid a major climate crisis. With the rising temperatures, mosquitoes carrying dengue have gained climate adaptive potential and thrived in colder climates—or the previously colder areas that are slowly warming up. Even though other mountain districts like Humla and Mustang haven’t reported any cases this year yet, we cannot deny the possibility. Equally concerning is the lack of community-level cleanliness, sanitation and preventive measures. Government bodies often claim they are searching and destroying the mosquito breeding grounds, but the results do not corroborate their claims. One might wonder what the government is doing amid such a health crisis. The truth is that it is not taking this vector-borne disease seriously. Nor have there been satisfactory efforts to equip the healthcare centres struggling with less manpower, insufficient medicines and space shortages. With the changing nature of mosquitoes, it is also necessary to conduct comprehensive research to be alert in upcoming years. Notably, this year, hill districts have seen thousands of positive cases while Madhesh, the comparatively hotter region, province has reported only 77 cases. This discrepancy also should be taken into consideration.Experts worry that the escalation of risks in those areas that aren’t traditional dengue hotspots has turned things upside down. Our infrastructures have not seen any progress for so long, but things have changed, and endemics have started emerging in new areas. But we haven’t invested in strengthening healthcare infrastructures accordingly. The time has come to heed experts’ concerns and deal with this change by allocating more budget for the health sector and upgrading their patient-accommodating capacities. In the short run, the government should conduct search and destroy programmes, cleanliness and sanitation drives, and increase the supply of medicines and human resources in affected areas. If not, these seemingly trivial mosquitoes can pose more danger in the days to come. \nWhile briefing about her official visit to India, from August 18 to 22, Foreign Minister Arzu Rana Deuba told the Nepali Congress (NC) central committee meeting on Friday that New Delhi’s response to Nepal's new coalition government was ‘positive’. This was a very cautious diplomatic statement. The term ‘positive’ in a diplomatic sense is unambiguously suboptimal in contrast to [being] ‘excited’ or ‘enthusiastic’. There is no hiding the fact that New Delhi was ‘okay’ with the replacement of the Moaist-CPN (UML) coalition by the NC-UML, but it has only sent lukewarm signals on the ascendance of KP Sharma Oli as prime minister, once again. Prime Minister Oli has made it a point to invite his Indian counterpart, Narendra Modi, through Foreign Minister Rana to visit Nepal; Oli has yet to receive a similar invitation despite newly appointed Indian foreign secretary Vikram Misri paying a two-day official visit to Nepal just two weeks ago. Many have viewed this as the lingering trust deficit between Oli and Modi.Be that as it may, New Delhi left no stone unturned to welcome Foreign Minister Rana and exude utmost warmth seldom seen during a foreign minister-level visit from Nepal. Rana had reportedly planned a private visit to Delhi for routine health check-up. On short notice, the South Block not only elevated it to a full-fledged official visit with an immediate invitation from her Indian counterpart, S Jaishankar, but also managed to schedule her appointment with Prime Minister Modi. Additionally, Modi accorded high importance to this meeting by involving key policymakers, including Foreign Minister Jaishankar, National Security Advisor Ajit Doval, Foreign Secretary Misri, Principal Secretary PK Mishra and Indian Ambassador to Nepal Naveen Srivastava.Shifting the neutral gearEqually rare in history, Indian and Nepali media alike positively portrayed Rana's India visit as a new stepping stone to pace the Nepal-India relations stuck in the neutral gear for at least a decade. Several serendipities worked: First, India needed a convincing diplomatic feat to reassure its neighbours that Modi's ‘neighbourhood first’, an overarching foreign policy instrument, has not faced a comprehensive debacle, even after the recent regime change in Bangladesh—India supported Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, who was compelled to resign and flee her country. Moreover, there has been a rise in anti-Indian politics in other neighbouring countries like Sri Lanka and Maldives.Second, Rana is not unfamiliar to Modi and Delhi’s power corridors. As the spouse of the five-time prime minister Sher Bahadur Deuba, she has had several opportunities for introduction and interaction with them. This certainly provides comfort in rolling the conversations, which are valuable in diplomatic dealings. It may seem trivial, but unlike many Nepali ministers, her English language skills and aristocratic sophistication come to her advantage in diplomacy.Third, the New Delhi establishment seemed unapologetically keen to recognise her as a (new) trusted friend in the Congress outfit and see her succeed in the first-ever ministerial responsibility. This has sent tremour waves to national politics back home. The coalition partner UML perhaps sees New Delhi's treatment of Rana as the manifestation of her special relations, something beyond what the government as a whole enjoys. Also, quite a few old-school compatriots in her party have now anxiously raised their eyebrows, assuming that India's trust may inch her forward in a bid to the party’s larger political role and government.Substantive issuesBeyond extensive paraphernalia, both sides claimed to have covered a broad range of issues of mutual interest, including the infrastructure and other projects related to cross-border railways, roads and bridges, Integrated Check Posts, petroleum pipelines and digital financial connectivity. Moreover, the increase in electricity export, reaching 1,000 megawatts, and the opportunities available in power sector cooperation after implementing the long-term power trade agreement were highlighted by both sides after her visit.However, a few contentious issues need deeper explorations than the tangential treatment they received in these bilateral talks. Straight air routes through Indian aerospace for the international flights operated to and from Nepal's newly constructed international airports in Bhairahawa and Pokhara, and clarity on the future of Gurkha recruitment in the Indian army are a few issues Nepal wants to see resolved soon. Operationalising electronic fund transfer gateways as the two prime ministers agreed a year ago and hassle-free processing to implement India-funded ‘small’ local development projects are on India's priority card.According to her post-visit briefing, Rana’s priority list included implementing the Pancheshwar Multipurpose Project and constructing a cross-border bridge over the Mahakali River connecting two countries. It was natural to show interest on her part, as the project agreement was signed 28 years ago when her husband became prime minister for the first time. The Mahakali border river, the location of the project site, runs along the political constituency of Deuba in Nepal’s far west. Furthermore, Rana made Kailali her political base in the same province.Regarding the Pancheshwar Project, India and Nepal’s priorities have diverged for a long time; the former preferred to optimise water use, and the latter focused on electricity production. Currently, as the power trade arrangements are gradually implemented, the interests seem to be converging. The peripheral issues of upper or lower riparian benefits, their components and pricing should no longer serve as constricting impediments. The enthusiasm rekindled in Kathmandu and Delhi to implement the project must not sublimate for decades, like in the past.Rana has had many firsts this time around. She became a minister for the first time, and it was her first official visit to any foreign nation as a minister. Besides, this is her first political and diplomatic responsibility, independent of nurturing her husband's political persona. Finally, her insight in navigating the complex geopolitical manoeuvres confronting Nepal will prove her mettle as a capable future leader of the country. And, her ability to manage the political waves that she created, possibly by winning the confidence of influential southern neighbours, may add at least some score to her future leadership bid in the Nepali Congress.  \nOne of the first major milestones in the development of renewable energy was way back in 1979, when US President Jimmy Carter installed 32 solar panels on the roof of the White House in order to power a water-heating system.Clunky, inefficient and expensive by today’s standards (they weighed 45 kilogrammes each and cost a whopping $28,000 to install), these panels served to heat water for the White House until they were removed during the Reagan administration, undoubtedly as a signal that the new Republican president preferred good old fossil fuels to these hippie-inspired and possibly commie ideas like sustainability and environmentalism.The panels went into storage until at least one of them ended up in a museum in China. There’s a certain irony to that, as China is currently leading the world when it comes to scaling up renewable energy, with twice as many solar and wind projects under construction as the rest of the world combined.Right now, China has 180GW of solar po­­wer under construction along with 159GW of wind power, which far outshines the comparatively measly 40GW under construction in the US. In the first half of this year, China’s clean energy generation has already exceeded the total amount of energy produced by the UK in a year from all sources.The push for renewables could be a lifesaver for poorer states. Existing projects are also being expanded, like the Caipeng photovoltaic power station, which holds the record for being the highest solar power plant in the world, and the Xinjiang solar farm, which has the capacity to power all of Papua New Guinea for an entire year.In fact, according to Reuters, China has installed so many solar panels that they’re generating more energy than the country’s storage and transmission infrastructure can handle! And because China just refuses to think small, it is also manufacturing practically all of the world’s equipment for producing solar panels and—because synergy is a good thing—is also now making over half of all new electric cars sold worldwide.The US is, of course, trying to catch up and one landmark there is that for the first time, the US has this year produced more electricity from wind and solar than it does from coal.It’s not just the richer countries that are taking advantage of this energy revolution. In fact, the push for renewables could be a lifesaver for poorer countries saddled with high fuel import bills for power production.Here, Uruguay stands out as a great example; this South American country was highly reliant on imported oil and gas-based power and, much like Pakistan, greatly suffered from financial shocks whenever the prices of these commodities spiked.Already at full capacity when it came to hydel power and unwilling to set up nuclear power plants that would rely on imported uranium, Ramón Méndez Galain, Uruguay’s then-director of energy, decided to bet on wind and solar power. He financed this by holding a series of clean power auctions, where the private sector was offered long-term contracts at guaranteed rates. This resulted in USD six billion invested in renewables in just five years.In short, he went for the IPP route, only with a focus on renewable energy and with undoubtedly more reasonable terms than we got here in Pakistan. Now Uruguay is reaping the dividends of this approach, with energy production costs having been cut in half and new jobs being created by the clean energy sector.Perhaps as importantly, Ramón’s vision has also practically insulated his country from the shocks of foreign wars and resultant supply issues; from July 2023 to April 2024, Uruguay ran entirely on renewable energy!There are cert­a­inly lessons here for Pakistan, which also pays far too high a price for fuel imports and is unable to withsta­­nd any financial shocks, resulting from high prices of imported fuel.Like Uruguay, we, too, are primed to take advantage of the natural bounties of wind and solar power, and thankfully, we can now see significant movement in that direction. Recently, K-Electric announced its intention of setting up renewable power projects of a combined 640MW. Bidding has already begun on one of these projects, a 150MW solar plant in Balochistan, where the expected tariff is said to be Rs11.2 per unit.In addition, the Sindh government is planning a 550MW floating solar energy project at Keenjhar Lake. Similar projects are underway across the country. When these and other such projects are online, Pakistan’s energy sector may finally have its day in the sun.Some may wonder why we are adding capacity when we can’t seem to be able to pay for the capacity we already have (and in many cases aren’t even using), but we have to understand that there are no quick fixes and that moving towards renewables in a big way will help us save big bucks in the future.— Dawn (Pakistan)/ANN  \nTikTok, a widely popular social media app, is set to come back to the Nepali market after the KP Sharma Oli-led government decided to lift a ban imposed by the previous government headed by Pushpa Kamal Dahal. The then government had raised moral concerns about the app, but now Oli wants to run it with considerable regulatory changes, which will take some time. Even though TikTok was often used to incite communal emotions and spread vulgarity, many took an outright ban as a violation of self-expression and free speech and cited that the app also had positive sides. Therefore, the incumbent government’s decision can be seen as a win-win situation in terms of freedom of expression and the need to demarcate the limits of freedom. For it to be able to resume its operations, TikTok is now mandated to fulfil certain conditions, such as promoting Nepal’s tourism, investing in digital literacy, uplifting Nepal’s public education system and keeping a watch on the content used on the site. According to data before the ban, the app housed around 2.2 million users nationwide, accounting for nearly 40 percent of bandwidth consumption. Having faced revenue loss for months, the social media site seems to have agreed to abide by the government’s directives about its fair use. Now that there will finally be a regulatory directive to handle TikTok, the government should focus on successfully implementing it. The world of social media is quite tricky, as anyone from anywhere can flout the rules and continue misusing them from the backstage. People kept running the app right under the government’s nose using virtual private networks (VPN). How the newly agreed-upon terms of engagement between the social media site and the Nepali government come into effect will be for us all to see in the near future.Being arguably the most misused social media app for causing social unrest, TikTok became the only site banned by the government. However, the concerns raised during its ban apply to other social media apps as well, not least Facebook, X and Instagram, with 10.58 million, 4.66 million and 3.60 million users, respectively. These apps continue to be sites of misogyny, racism, casteism and misinformation, among other concerns of discrimination and discord. But they have also offered many opportunities to voice their opinions and make themselves heard. They have provided youth with employment and entrepreneurship opportunities, not least in Nepal, where we have a vibrant community of social media influencers, celebrities and entrepreneurs. Banning TikTok, or any other medium of expression for that matter, is never a solution, and the current government seems to have realised it. But it should remain vigilant not to let any such social media site become a tool of misuse, exploitation and social discord. The general public should also be sensitised about how grave an impact their irrational behaviours can have in a country like ours which values mutual trust, cooperation as well as religious harmony. There is no other option but to follow the regulations. \nUS President Joe Biden and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday discussed the Russia-Ukraine war following Modi’s visit to Ukraine, along with the situation in Bangladesh where protests led to the ousting of former leader Sheikh Hasina earlier this month.Modi posted online that he discussed the situation in Ukraine with Biden over the phone and “reiterated India’s full support for early return of peace and stability.” He also said the two leaders stressed “the need for early restoration of normalcy, and ensuring the safety and security of minorities, especially Hindus, in Bangladesh.”The White House issued a separate statement, saying Biden commended Modi’s recent visit to Poland and Ukraine, and that both leaders expressed “support for a peaceful resolution of the conflict in accordance with international law, on the basis of the UN Charter.”Last week, Modi visited Ukraine in the first visit by an Indian prime minister in modern Ukrainian history. It came at a volatile juncture in the war launched by Russia in February 2022. Moscow is making slow gains in eastern Ukraine as Kyiv presses a cross-border incursion.Modi urged President Volodymyr Zelenskiy to sit down for talks with Russia to end the war and offered to help bring peace.Modi’s Ukraine visit followed a visit he made to Russia in July where he embraced President Vladimir Putin on the same day that a deadly Russian missile strike hit a children’s hospital. That visit angered Ukraine and the U.S. State Department said it raised concerns with India about ties with Russia.Moscow has been a large weapons supplier to India since the Soviet Union days. Washington in recent years has looked to woo New Delhi  to counter China’s influence.Modi said the two leaders also discussed the situation in Bangladesh where about 300 people, many of them university and college students, were killed during protests that began in July with students agitating against quotas in government jobs before the events spiraled into demonstrations to oust long-serving former Prime Minister Hasina.An interim government headed by Nobel Peace Prize winner Muhammad Yunus was sworn in after Hasina fled to India. Attacks were reported against Muslim-majority Bangladesh’s minorities, especially Hindus, amid the protests.Hindu nationalist Modi’s own government in Hindu-majority India has faced criticism over the years over attacks on minorities, especially Muslims. \nOn Tuesday, the country is expected to witness partly to generally cloudy conditions throughout the day, with light to moderate rain accompanied by thunder and lightning likely in several parts of Koshi, Bagmati, and Lumbini provinces.Heavy rainfall is anticipated in one or two locations within these provinces. Brief thundershowers may also occur in some areas of other provinces, according to the Meteorological Forecasting Division.Tonight, similar weather conditions are expected, with partly to generally cloudy skies across the country. Light rain or thunderstorms may occur in a few places in Koshi, Bagmati, Karnali, and Sudurpaschim provinces, while one or two places in the remaining provinces may also experience light precipitation.The met office said the monsoon trough is positioned south of its average location in the west and near its average location in the east.On Monday, the highest maximum temperature was recorded at Dipayal at 35.8°C, while the lowest minimum temperature was observed at Jiri at 14.9°C. The highest rainfall in the past 24 hours was recorded in Dharan at 28.5 mm. \nTwo people were killed when a motorcycle collided with a Tata Sumo car near Dhansar bridge in Chandrapur-4 on Tuesday.The four-wheeler, with registration number Ba 03-001 Cha 531, was heading east from Dhansar bridge when it struck the motorcycle, registered as Province 1-02-043 Pa 8025, resulting in the deaths of the two individuals on the bike, according to Deputy Superintendent of Police Rajkumar Rai.The deceased have been identified as Tulasi Ojha, a resident of Dharan Sub-Metropolitan City-15, Sunsari, and Bibas Banskota, a resident of Sundarharaicha Municipality-11, Morang.\"Both victims sustained severe injuries and were rushed to Civil Hospital in Chandranigahapur, where they were pronounced dead by the doctors,\" Rai confirmed.Police have recovered the Tata Sumo, but the driver remains at large.The bodies of the deceased have been sent to the Primary Health Care Centre in Chandranigahpur for post-mortem examinations. \nSayyid Badr bin Hamad bin Hamood Albusaidi, the minister of foreign affairs of Oman, arrived in Kathmandu on a two-day official visit to Nepal at the invitation of Minister for Foreign Affairs Arzu Rana.The foreign minister of Oman was received by Foreign Secretary Sewa Lamsal upon arrival at the Tribhuvan International Airport in Kathmandu, said the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on X. The two foreign ministers are scheduled to hold a bilateral meeting and discuss various matters on further strengthening Nepal-Oman relations, according to the ministry. During the visit, Albusaidi will pay a courtesy call on President Ramchandra Paudel and Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli, said the ministry in a statement on Sunday.Nepal and the Sultanate of Oman established their diplomatic relations on January 21, 1977.The two sides exchanged some high-level visits in the past. Late King Birendra and Queen Aishwarya visited Oman in 1986 and the then prime minister Sher Bahadur Deuba in 2017. \nSeparatist militant attacks on police stations, railway lines and highways in Pakistan’s restive province of Balochistan, coupled with retaliatory operations by security forces, killed at least 51 people, officials said on Monday.The most widespread assault by ethnic insurgents in years forms part of a decades-long effort to win secession of the resource-rich southwestern province, home to major China-led projects such as a strategic port and a gold and copper mine.“These attacks are a well thought out plan to create anarchy in Pakistan,” Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi said in a statement, adding that security forces had killed 12 militants in operations after the attacks, but without giving details.The largest of the attacks targeted vehicles from buses to goods trucks on a major highway, killing at least 23 people, officials said, with 35 vehicles set ablaze.Rail traffic with Quetta was suspended following blasts on a rail bridge linking the provincial capital to the rest of Pakistan, as well as on a rail link to neighbouring Iran, railways official Muhammad Kashif said.Police said they had found six as yet unidentified bodies near the site of the attack on the railway bridge.Officials said militants also targeted police and security stations in Balochistan, which is Pakistan’s largest province, killing at least 10 people in one attack.Militant group the Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) took responsibility in a statement to journalists that claimed many more attacks, including one on a major paramilitary base, though Pakistani authorities have yet to confirm these.The BLA is the biggest of several ethnic insurgent groups that have battled the central government for decades, saying it unfairly exploits Balochistan's gas and mineral resources. It seeks the expulsion of China and independence for the province.Naqvi’s comments came after the office of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif vowed in a statement that security forces would retaliate for the attacks and bring those responsible to justice.PASSENGERS KILLEDOn Sunday night, armed men blocked a highway in Balochistan, marched passengers off vehicles, and shot them after checking their identity cards, a senior superintendent of police, Ayub Achakzai, told Reuters.As many as 35 vehicles, including trucks, were set on fire on the highway in the area of Musakhail.“The armed men also not only killed passengers but also killed the drivers of trucks carrying coal,” said Hameed Zahir, the deputy commissioner of the area.Militants have targeted workers from the eastern province of Punjab whom they see as exploiting their resources.In the past, they have also attacked Chinese interests and citizens in the province, where China runs the strategic southern deepwater port of Gawadar, as well as a gold and copper mine in its west.The BLA said its fighters targeted military personnel travelling in civilian clothes, who were shot after being identified. Pakistan’s interior ministry said the dead were innocent citizens.Six security personnel, three civilians and one tribal elder made up the ten killed in clashes with armed militants who stormed a station of the Balochistan Levies in the central district of Kalat, police official Dostain Khan Dashti said.Officials said police stations had also been attacked in the two southern coastal towns, but the toll had yet to be confirmed.Balochistan, which borders both Iran and Afghanistan, is Pakistan’s largest province by size, but the least populated and it remains largely underdeveloped, with high levels of poverty. \nDespite slowed economic growth, Nepal’s external sector appears stronger than ever, thanks to remittances, tourism and the appreciation of the US dollar.Nepal’s three external indicators—foreign exchange reserve, remittance earnings, and tourism income, which represent all international economic transactions between residents of the country—reached a historic high in the last fiscal year that ended mid-July.Conversely, the country’s statistical body, the National Statistics Office, has projected Nepal’s economic growth to be at a meagre 3.87 percent for 2023-24 due to the poor performance of the internal sector. According to experts, the mismatch is due to political uncertainty and growing corruption, as the external sector's growth did not support the internal sector. “It’s good that tourism income has grown. This will generate jobs,” said Nara Bahadur Thapa, former executive director at Nepal Rastra Bank, the country’s central bank. “But at the same time, growing remittance earnings means no job prospects at home. But the money sent by migrant workers has boosted foreign exchange reserves to an all-time high.”Though Nepal is in a remittance trap, the country could turn this into an opportunity by investing in the real sector. “The best option to channel remittances is to bring the private sector on board for investment in the productive sector,” said Thapa.Experts said that since the interest rate on credit has dropped significantly due to the huge amount of liquidity, investment is all that the country needs now. In the last fiscal year, Nepal’s gross foreign exchange reserves increased 32.6 percent to Rs2.04 trillion, a historic high. According to experts, such a trend in a least-developed country indicates no investment. According to the central bank report released on Sunday, remittance inflows increased 16.5 percent to Rs1.44 trillion in the last fiscal year, the highest amount on record.The remittances have been increasing because youth are leaving. In the last fiscal year, foreign employment permits were issued for 741,302 individuals (460,103 first-time and 281,199 renewed). The number is a slight reduction from 774,976 in the previous fiscal year.Under the service account, travel income, or expenditure made by foreign tourists, increased 32.1 percent to Rs82.33 billion in the review year, the highest revenue on record. The total number of tourist arrivals increased to 1.12 million in the last fiscal year from 862,992 in the previous fiscal year.The balance of payments remained at a surplus of Rs502.49 billion in the review year.With the upbeat external sector, the internal sector has remained dismal.“This is because the private sector investment has been shrinking for the last two years,” said Chandra Dhakal, president of the Federation of Nepalese Chambers of Commerce and Industry, the apex private sector body. He was speaking at an interaction in Kathmandu on Sunday.“As Nepal’s industrial capacity is under 40 percent. The private sector investment that contributes 86 percent to the economy has shrunk. This will naturally not generate employment opportunities.”He said that the demand for workers has boomed in the country, where the private sector has thrived. The World Bank said in its recent report that frequent political changes, a significant drag on businesses for over a decade, have dampened private investment. Thriving corruption and lack of accountability have stalled growth and forced tens of thousands of young Nepalis to try their luck abroad.Thapa, a former official at the central bank, said that with billions of dollars in the banks, the incumbent government has an opportunity to take advantage of it.Nepal is currently ruled by an unusual coalition of the two largest parties and this brings both challenges and opportunities. “The government has to facilitate the private sector. It has to ask the private sector to bring forward ready-to-invest projects,” said Thapa. The capital market is gaining momentum. “Through initial public offerings (IPOs) and follow-on public offers (FPOs), the government can facilitate raising money and enable the private sector to invest in the productive sectors that create jobs,” said Thapa. However, political wrangling has paralysed the country.The Securities Board of Nepal (SEBON) and Nepal Tourism Board have been headless for months. Nepal Electricity Authority has yet to open the door for signing the power purchase agreement with the big developers even though the country has huge loanable funds.“The government and the private sector both have to invest,” said Dhakal. “For every rupee the government spends, the private sector has been spending Rs5.”Economists say that the government’s capital injection into the economy would encourage the private sector to pump the investment.Over the years, private investment has remained sluggish. For example, the import restriction imposed by the government two years ago discouraged the private sector from spending, decreasing capital in the market and intermediate goods imports. As a result, public consumption and investment contracted, ultimately impacting the government’s revenue collection.Economists and statisticians say Nepal, which is set to graduate from the least developed countries by 2026, does not have the environment to achieve double-digit economic growth in the immediate future due to low investment from the government and the private sector.The country’s statistical office recently said that, given the ongoing investment, Nepal’s growth rate will neither slow down nor grow. It will remain static. According to economists, everything from wages to business growth and social security to other state benefits will remain static, which will encourage youth to try their luck abroad. \nAs the festive season approaches—a time when consumers are mercilessly exploited—the government is doubling down on its efforts to set up consumer courts for the first time in Nepal, aiming to safeguard consumer rights.It has been nearly two and a half years since the Supreme Court ordered the government to establish consumer courts in all provinces to speed up justice delivery.On Sunday, Industry, Commerce and Supplies Minister Damodar Bhandari told an interaction at the central supply and consumer department of the Nepali Congress that a consumer court would be established within a month.“The presence of the consumer court will have a significant impact on controlling food adulteration, artificial shortage and price manipulation.”But consumer rights activists remain sceptical and dismiss it as yet another lofty promise.Consumers face difficulty accessing water, energy, telecoms and financial services, despite paying for them. Besides, as Nepal’s e-commerce grows, now more than ever, instances of consumers fraud are becoming more prevalent.Nepal’s quality control watchdog, the Department of Food Technology and Quality Control, filed 178 cases in district administration offices against producers and traders for producing and selling substandard food items and animal feed in the last fiscal year. There were 121 cases in the previous fiscal year. Consumer rights activists say the district administrations deliver justice in only a handful of cases.Speaking at the interaction, lawmakers criticised party politics for protecting wrongdoers.They said that whenever market inspection teams raid certain shops or factories, top officials receive phone calls to protect those businesses. On May 28, the budget announced the allocation of necessary funds to set up consumer courts. An official at the Ministry of Industry, Commerce and Supplies said that the government allocated a budget of Rs10 million for administrative expenses to establish at least one consumer court in one of the districts in Kathmandu Valley. However, setting up consumer courts requires a considerable amount of money. As a temporary measure to comply with the Supreme Court’s order, officials plan to rent a separate room in a district administration office to set up the court, which will then begin hearing cases.Consumer rights activists said that forming a court within a month is impossible.“I attended the function when the industry minister Bhandari delivered his speech. We applauded, and the function concluded,” said Prem Lal Maharjan, president of the National Consumers Forum.“This is one of the glaring examples of how promises are made and not delivered.”“A consumer court inside a district administrative office, with a limited budget and few judges, is a joke,” said Maharjan. The top court had ordered the setting up of consumer courts in all 77 districts with separate infrastructure. In mid-June, the Industry Ministry's draft report on establishing a consumer court was submitted to the Law Ministry and sent to the Judicial Council for its suggestions.However, Ashok Kumar Chhetri, spokesperson for the Judicial Council, said he was unaware of the development.“The draft regarding the formation of consumer courts has not come to my notice.” The Consumer Protection Act, 2018, has a provision requiring the government to establish consumer courts. Based on this provision, the Ministry of Industry, Commerce, and Supplies submitted a draft of legislation to the Ministry of Law in September 2019. As the process dragged on, the Supreme Court, on February 20, 2022, ordered the government to establish consumer courts in all provinces to protect buyers' interests amid repeated instances of unfair market practices.A division bench of justices Bam Kumar Shrestha and Nahakul Subedi issued the order after the Forum for Protection of Consumer Rights Nepal moved the court. Although the draft reached the Ministry of Law and then the Ministry of Industry, Commerce, and Supplies, the process has been delayed due to frequent changes in government.According to an official update on the development, the Ministry of Industry cancelled the previous process last year and started afresh by forming a committee.The committee recommended setting up a pilot consumer court in a suitable location within the Kathmandu Valley, in coordination with or on the advice of the Judicial Council, considering the country's current condition and available resources, the official said. According to officials, more consumer courts will be gradually established in other districts based on financial resources.The Industry Ministry official said they realised that setting up just one consumer court per province would not be practical, as people would have to travel long distances for their cases. Therefore, the draft proposes gradually setting up consumer courts in all districts.A consumer court is a specialised court which primarily deals with consumer-related disputes, conflicts, and grievances. The court holds hearings to adjudicate these issues.The public has long been demanding a consumer court to bring unscrupulous traders under a legal framework within a fast-track system.Since consumers often hesitate to get involved in complex court cases, observers believe this has emboldened dishonest traders. They believe that once consumer courts are established, filing complaints will become easier, and the process will involve fewer hassles. \nAnother Olympic Games has come and gone and Nepal’s quest to bring home an official Olympic medal continues to seem like a pipe dream.Nepal sent seven athletes to the 2024 Summer Games in Paris to compete in six different sports but none of them will have anything to show for back home—no athlete from Nepal has won a single official medal in the country’s 60-year Olympic history.But, is it at all realistic to expect an Olympic medal from Nepali athletes?“Winning a medal at the Olympics is not impossible. But our investment and preparation for the Olympics and other international events are woefully inadequate,” said former Olympican Deepak Bista, who currently serves as the president of Nepal Olympians Association and the director of national team preparation, at the National Sports Council. “There are no proper venues for players to train and practice, So how do you compete against elite athletes from around the world?” Athlete Santoshi Shrestha completed the difficult 41.195km track of the women’s marathon event in the 79th position out of 91 athletes. Her timing of 2 hours 55 minutes and 06 seconds was far from her previous best and national record of 2 hours 46 minutes and 23 seconds, which she set on the way to marathon debut gold at Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Dhaka Marathon earlier this year.After the women’s marathon, Santoshi said she could have set a new national record in Paris had she pushed herself more in an endurance-testing track, but she chose not to because of fear of possible injury.“I could not take the risk because the track was very steep after 15 km. I was comfortable and could have made a new record there [in Paris] but I chose to stay in the comfort zone. I want to compete in other tournaments as well,” said Santoshi.But Santoshi’s story could have been different had her preparations and training back home been better. “Further, players, coaches and team management all need to work hard with complete focus and dedication all round the year if they are to bring medals. Sadly, the state of our players is not good enough. They are compelled to find other jobs so that they can look after their families. How can we expect them to win medals at big tournaments?” added Bista, who was the second Nepali athlete to qualify for the Olympics, Beijing 2008.“The players need physical, mental and financial support.”Former Nepali Olympian Sangina Baidya also points to poor investment and preparation in sports for Nepal’s underperformance at the Olympics.“There is a lack of extensive investment in sports infrastructures. The state should be interested in the development of sports. If there is sufficient investment at the youth level, and they get substantial funding, resources and infractures, they can undoubtedly perform better in the international competitions including the Olympics,” said taekwondo practitioner Baidya, who was the first Nepali athlete to qualify for the Olympics, in Athens 2004, through a selection tournament.“In comparison to other successful countries, here in Nepal, preparations for the Olympics start late. They get only a few months of training, which is not enough,” she added.Judoka Manita Shrestha Pradhan has a similar story. She got a training room only two months before the Olympics and she was still expected to win at least one or two bouts in Paris—which is a lot to ask for. Shrestha Pradhan could not progress beyond the first round of women’s 57 kg weight category event.There is no targeted budget for the Olympics programme despite the sports sector getting Rs3.5 billion for the fiscal year 2024/25. Only Rs9 million was allocated for the transport, lodging and food of athletes and officials participating in the Paris Olympics and Paralympics.The Nepal Olympic Committee provides $750 per person to the 10 athletes of the 10 sports under the International Olympic Committee’s Solidarity scholarship, which is insufficient. Swimmers Alexander Shah and Duana Lama trained abroad, in the United States and Thailand, respectively, but the scholarship amount was not enough for them to train at top-class facilities. Lama finished last in her Heat and 30th overall in women’s 200m freestyle.Shah, who was competing at the Olympics for a second consecutive time, will at least return home with some joy. His 51.91 seconds in the men’s 100m freestyle Heat shattered his own previous national record of 52.17 seconds set during the World Aquatic Championship in Doha, Qatar.Badminton star Prince Dahal trained in Sri Lanka and had to travel to Paris 2024 without a coach as Nepali authorities did not send the name of the coach for accreditation and visa process on time.Prince Dahal could not win a single match in the men’s singles group stage. Shooter Sushmita Nepal finished 42nd in the women’s 10m air rifle qualification event. Table tennis player Santoo Shrestha also exited the Olympics from the men’s singles preliminary round.But big investment in sports may not always do the trick.Santoo Shrestha, who competed in the men’s singles table tennis at Paris Olympics, was the only third player in Nepal’s Olympic history to qualify for the Olympics through the selection stage—which is a perfect demonstration of how poor the country is technically.Take Jamaica and Kenya. Athletes in these countries are highly successful in athletics.Jamaica—the home of sprinter Usian Bolt, eight time Olympic gold medallist and world record holder in the 100 metres, 200 metres, and 4 × 100 metres relay—has won a total of 87 medals at the Olympics. Of them 86 have come from track and field.Kenya is the most successful African country at the Olympics, with a total of 124 medals so far. Of them 117 are from track and field and seven from boxing.Ethiopia is another nation which focuses on long-distance events. Their total of 58 Olympic medals have all come in long-distance events in athletics.India was once a dominant country in field hockey and won a record 11 Olympic medals, including eight golds between 1928 and 1980. Although the country experienced a drought in hockey medals, the sport is gradually finding new success after its team picked two consecutive hockey bronze medals in Tokyo 2020 and Paris 2024. Wrestling and shooting are the other sports Indian athletes specialise in.“The government should learn from how other countries prepare their athletes,” said Bista, suggesting that Nepal should target some sports for the 2028 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles and prepare accordingly.Nepal has won a total of 26 medals at the Asian Games. Of them, it has bagged 24 medals in martial arts, which include karate (4), taekwondo (14) and boxing (6). “Nepal should select sports in which Nepal is historically good, for instance martial arts. After that, the government should allocate a significant budget just for the Olympics programme and train the players from the beginning if it expects our athletes to do better,” Bista added.Technically, Nepal’s only medal at the Olympics came in 1988 in Seoul when Bidhan Lama won a bronze medal in the men’s 50kg weight category taekwondo competition. But his medal was counted as unofficial as the sport was then an exhibition event. Taekwondo entered the Olympics programme only at Sydney 2000.But the 2026 Asian Games in Aichi-Nagoya, Japan could be a head start.The National Sports Council has launched Mission 2026 as part of the preparations for the next Asiad and has targeted at least 10 medals. But, sadly, the government has only approved Rs20 million for the programme.“We don’t have enough funding for the programme. This amount will support our athletes for only five to six months. It is unfortunate that the government could not embrace the NSC’s mission.” Bista said, adding that he fears Mission 2026 will just be an ambitious dream.But Bista hopes Palesha Goverdhan may change history despite the odds. Goverdhan became the first Nepali paralympian to pass the selection stage when she qualified for the Paris Paralympics. She won a gold medal in the Asian Qualifiers in China.Govardhan also won a bronze at the 2022 Asian Para Games, becoming the first Nepali para athlete to win a medal at the event.“Palesha is training in London under one of the best trainers,” said Bista who added that the NSC is paying her training fees. \nKunwar has been the MD for just under three years. Before coming back to her homeland to join Daraz Nepal, she worked at different American companies, including Amazon, the world’s biggest e-commerce platform. In this conversation, Kunwar talks about the opportunities and challenges of running an e-commerce enterprise in Nepal, as well as the country’s overall business environment.  \nWhen the Ranjitkar group was established, they discovered this forgotten dance and devoted two years to researching it.Now, they are reintroducing it during Indra Jatra by training the new generation in this traditional art form. \nHe is known for his nationalist legacy, marked by the amendment of Nepal's map to include territories like Kalapani, Lipulekh, and Limpiyadhura, and his strong stance against India, especially during and after the 2015 Nepal blockade.But how did he rise to become the country's powerful man? \nPyakuryal holds a Phd in Public Affairs from the University of Akron, US. In this interview, they discuss Nepal’s elusive political stability, the narratives governing Nepali politics, the role of patriarchy, and the trends in Nepali politics Pyakuryal will be closely following in the years ahead. \nOn a rainy afternoon, I found myself sitting in a microbus. I leaned closer towards the window while passengers crowded inside as if my slight adjustment would miraculously carve enough space for everyone on board. Approximately ten seats were inside, enclosed by a low ceiling that forced unfortunate standers to duck their heads. I was lucky to snag a window seat before the bus picked up more people.After several staggered pauses every few meters—in an attempt to pick up as many stragglers as possible—we finally took off. The ride was slow and uneventful, sans the moisture accumulating on my right shoulder. I clutched the umbrella in my lap and absentmindedly watched the traffic passing by, noting the buildings and restaurants on the route that had grown surprisingly familiar through my first month in Nepal. It was quite different from my first few days here when everything was unfamiliar. Even in America, I had never lived or worked in a big city, and Kathmandu's pollution and bustling traffic were something to get used to. I had grown well-adjusted to crossing roads and dodging motorbikes on my daily walks. Sometimes, I stopped at a local fruit vendor and picked up a mango. I suppose I was “living like a local” somehow, cramming myself into a microbus for Rs20 or buying fruit for another 50. But perhaps more accurately, I realised that my two-month stint in Nepal involved more careful coexistence with the locals than anything.Since arriving, I have coexisted with others as I have never done before. I was overly cautious of the shared kitchen in my living space or ensuring I didn’t step on anyone’s toes on a crowded bus. I turned my eyes from stares as I walked down the street, unsure if it was my clothing, my face, or some other indistinguishable characteristic that marked me as different. My fateful afternoon ride on the microbus also reminded me of my work in Nepal. This summer, I was interning at Siddhartha Art Gallery in preparation for the Kathmandu Triennale in 2026. The theme of the Triennale is coexistence, kinship, and care.During my internship, I realised there was much more to coexistence than difference. One of the goals of the Triennale is to explore coexistence as “kinship among all beings, peoples, cultures, ecologies, faiths, and thoughts.” Kinship, intimacy, and solidarity are all movements of coexistence that build bridges across seemingly vast chasms of difference.In honour of the upcoming Triennale, the Australian Embassy held a reception on July 26, which I was lucky enough to attend, to formally introduce the event and its thematic importance. Gathered in Australian ambassador Felicity Volk’s home was an eclectic group of people from Switzerland to Cambodia, who all seemed excited to learn more about what the team behind the 2026 Triennale had in store for them. Volk opened the reception with a powerful speech on coexistence and art. “As we look around at a world fractured by politics, by war and heightened geopolitical tensions, by climate change and environmental devastation…as we look at all of this, we are reminded that we also need to look for the ways we are united,” she declared, continuing to highlight the crucial role that artists play in healing such deep fractures. “In a time of crisis—a crisis of existence and coexistence—we need the humanity, the self-expression, the healing and the community that the artists and their arts create and nourish.” I couldn’t agree more. As I researched prospective artists for the 2026 Triennale, I noticed that their works often explored similar themes like displacement, indigeneity, and women’s rights while maintaining the individual style and perspective that made their art uniquely theirs. These were also artists across the world, heralding from Nepal to Australia. Somehow, I felt a thread of solidarity running through their creations; they seemed to speak to a universal struggle for liberation. Scrolling through daily news articles and videos, I could sense that commonality underpinning so much of the media circulating worldwide, echoing calls for justice, protest and revolution. In a uniquely post-colonial and digital world, many of us have reckoned that we could not distance ourselves from injustice simply because of its location.The Kathmandu Triennale also brings together international and local artists. I found this form of globalisation potent—not only to wonder but to know that someone was encountering the same obstacles as you thousands of miles away. Here was this foreigner whose name you had never heard of before, and they were grieving, too, and feeling, too. Suddenly, their work did not feel so foreign anymore.In Nepal, I found myself experiencing intimate moments in surprising places. For one, the microbus, where I sat knee-to-knee with a dozen strangers, packed together like sardines. If the bus stopped suddenly, we all lurched forward like our bodies had been tied together and then untied the moment the bus moved again. Afterwards, we laughed, albeit a bit nervously, and apologised to the person whose arm we grabbed for support.Afterwards, I was unsure if everyone on board could still be strangers. I was reminded of my college coursework, which introduced me to intimacy, kinship, and its unexpected manifestations. One of my professors explained that kinship was often established through ritual. However, the rituals didn’t have to be remarkable or elaborate. It could be mundane or sneakily Quotidian. The everyday repetition of crossing the street in Nepal came to my mind. I was initially terrified, missing the well-obeyed traffic lights and pedestrian crossings I had taken for granted in my hometown. But as I completed each daily commute to work, crossing the road grew increasingly more reflexive. It was easiest when I wasn’t alone. Walking alongside a stranger, our steps synchronised, both of us hoping to match the other. It was oddly reassuring. Upon reaching the other side, we swiftly parted ways. Then we were strangers again, united only by one fleeting spurt of required coordination, but this ritual would repeat itself, day after day, with countless people who were strangers but, briefly, not quite. As my time in Nepal ends, I reflect on these fleeting moments of kinship and intimacy in anticipation of the Triennale. Caring for one another is critical, especially as a global community. How can we express that care through artwork? How can we truly hear each other? The first step might be recognising the importance of active rather than passive coexistence. Solidarity is a challenging thing to build. Realising common hardship, demystifying what is foreign, identifying the artist as more than just an artist and the stranger as more than a stranger—only then can we walk together. \nThe shopkeeper asked if I was a police officer or worked for the Nepal police when I went to purchase the book ‘Bepatta Sipahi’. His question surprised me, so I asked why he thought that. He mentioned that many police officers often ask for this book, so he assumed I might be one of them.This made me wonder what was in the book that prompted such a question. I knew it was the sequel to ‘Sipahi Ko Diary’, a book about war and soldiers. But later, I understood why the police were particularly interested in it.The decade-long civil war in Nepal is often said to have set the country back by 100 years. Beyond the physical devastation, it took thousands of innocent lives and shattered countless families. Similarly, the Kedarnath flood on June 16, 2013, also claimed thousands of lives. While these two events might seem unrelated, they are deeply interconnected in ‘Bepatta Sipahi’. These two incidents shape the narrative, plot, and characters.‘Bepatta Sipahi’ is a story of pain, death, and destruction brought by war, affecting both soldiers and their families. Just as life seems to stabilise, more suffering is introduced by the Kedarnath flood. The book revolves around Tej Bahadur Raut, a missing soldier who served in the Nepal Army during the civil war. Through his first-person perspective, the story vividly portrays the horrors of war—the deaths of comrades, the mass graves, and the blood-soaked battlegrounds shared by both soldiers and Maoist fighters. It highlights the tragic reality of Nepali citizens forced to fight against those they once considered brothers and sisters, all due to political turmoil.In ‘Sipahi Ko Diary’, the writer narrates the experiences and struggles of the soldier Shiva Chhetri. In ‘Bepatta Sipahi’, the focus shifts to his fellow soldier, Tej Bahadur Raut, who went missing during the war. During a visit to Kedarnath with his cousin-brother, Shiva comes across Tej's diary. The story unfolds through this diary, where Tej recounts various war incidents, his family troubles, the horrors of battle, and the circumstances leading to his disappearance. Shiva is portrayed as a brave soldier, often leading his team to victories against the Maoists and earning praise from his superiors and peers. However, after a significant incident, his life takes a dramatic turn, opening up a new chapter in the story.The connection between Tej's journey from the civil war to the Kedarnath flood is captivating, keeping readers on edge and eager to find out what happens next. The story is filled with twists, making it difficult to predict the plot. This book blends elements of thriller, suspense, romance, and more, capturing the rollercoaster of Tej's life as he navigates through unforeseen challenges and finds himself in situations he never imagined. The unpredictable turns in his life echo the book's line, \"Manchey le socheko pugdaina vanchan. Tara sochyo vane pugcha,\" meaning, \"People say just expecting, or thinking is not enough. But it is enough.\" The story reflects that while life is full of surprises, expecting the unexpected is no surprise.Katuwal's ‘Bepatta Sipahi’ spans different periods, from the civil war to the Kedarnath flood, with time shifting as the author narrates various events. The book also includes a fragment from the diary of Tej's sister, Niru, a Maoist soldier. Mentioned in Tej's diary, Niru’s account provides insight into the perspective of a Maoist soldier. It reveals why she joined the Maoists and became a soldier, even if it meant opposing her family and turning her brother into an enemy. The book portrays the shared terror of war through her story, where soldiers on both sides are tragically forced to fight against each other.The war scenes in ‘Bepatta Sipahi’ are depicted with striking detail, capturing every nuance of the experience. The emotions involved—firing at the enemy, having brief conversations with comrades, or witnessing their deaths—are conveyed, allowing readers to fully immerse themselves in the story.The writer incorporates multiple languages in the book, including Nepali, Hindi, and English, adding depth and authenticity to the narrative.The book provides a detailed portrayal of the civil war, vividly illustrating the conditions people and villages face. It captures the horror of war through the eyes of a soldier, highlighting the uncertainty of their lives and the government's shortcomings in protecting them. The character often voices frustration over the government's neglect of soldiers' safety.While ‘Bepatta Sipahi’ focuses on Tej's life, the array of characters and shifting settings—from the battlefield to Kedarnath—can initially be confusing. The story may seem disjointed initially, but the connections between the characters and events become clearer as readers progress. However, the book has some literary shortcomings, such as using specialised military terminology that might be challenging for some readers.Although ‘Bepatta Sipahi’ is a sequel to ‘Sipahi Ko Diary’, it stands alone and can be understood without reading the first book. While ‘Sipahi Ko Diary’ recounts the author's experiences as a soldier, ‘Bepatta Sipahi’ shifts focus to the story of a fellow soldier and his search for him, drawing on the author's real-life experiences.Bepatta SipahiAuthor: Chandra KatuwalYear: 2022Publisher: Bhundipuran PrakashanPages: 216 \nTwo and half months after its general convention, the Janata Samajbadi Party-Nepal picked office-bearers and central committee members.Chairman Upendra Yadav was given the mandate to select the party’s leadership without holding an election after the general convention was concluded without electing office bearers following the registration of candidacies for the positions.Chairman Yadav on Monday appointed a 30-member central executive committee and 27 central members and named the members of the central discipline commission, central audit commission, and central election commission.JSP-Nepal announced its central members and nine-member central executive committee after a month of the convention, but it struggled to pick office bearers.Rakam Chemjong has been appointed as co-chairman, while Raj Kishor Yadav, Mrigendra Kumar Singh Yadav, Govinda Chaudhary, Shivalal Thapa Magar, and Bidyut Bajracharya have been named vice-chairmen.The party has named Lalbabu Raut and Ram Kumar Sharma as general secretaries, while Manish Kumar Suman has been given the role of spokesperson.

Bhaktapur, which sees jatras and festivals round the year, is no stranger to music, dance and celebrations. But this is not an ordinary occasion. The performers in question are Lakhe dancers who are reviving the Ranjitkar Lakhe dance after a century.The young dancers are preparing for Indra Jatra this year, where mask-clad Lakhe dancers roam the streets to rid the community of hardships and suffering. Lakhe, demon deities revered as protectors of people and crops, are thought to reside in the demonic mask. As the dancer dons the mask, the spirit is said to take over.Bhaktapur was once a key site for the Ranjitkar Lakhe performances, but the art form vanished from the city after the 1934 earthquake.“Bhaktapur suffered the most damage during the 1934 earthquake,\" says Ganesh Ram Ranjit, treasurer of the Ranjitkar Group’s Bhaktapur branch. “The destruction left residents struggling to recover for a decade, making it nearly impossible to perform the costly Lakhe dance.”The Ranjitkar Group discovered the extinct dance in the year the group was established. They located a Lakhe temple in Bhaktapur that had closed after the earthquake. After two years of research, they learned that performing the Lakhe dance was seen as a good omen in Bhaktapur and involved hosting community feasts. However, the high cost of this tradition forced many to sell their properties, rendering it unfeasible in the city’s post-earthquake conditions. Over time, the dance was abandoned as more lands supporting these cultural events were lost during rapid urbanisation.“There was a significant decline in our engagement with our cultural heritage,” says Rabi Shakya, a sculptor and Lakhe dance teacher training the new dancers. “The encouraging change now is the strong interest from the new generation, which is making it possible to revive intangible heritage like this dance.”After 100 years, the Ranjitkar Lakhe Dance is making a return to Bhaktapur at this year’s Indra Jatra.“It’s challenging to accurately re-enact the dance since it hasn’t been seen in a century,” Shakya notes. “As a sculptor, I drew inspiration from Bhaktapur’s revered Shree Navadurga Bhawani to create the Lakhe’s mask.” Similarly, the dance was choreographed by studying Lakhe dances from Kathmandu, Patan, and Banepa within the Ranjitkar community, and combining them with traditional steps from Bhaktapur Lakhe dances.“As for the musical instruments, we are using traditional instruments like Dha, Dhime, and Ponga, which are said to excite the Lakhe,” says Rajendra Maharjan, Lakhe dance teacher and musician.Maharjan is one of the experienced Newari arts teachers working to revive the lost Lakhe dance. He is involved in training young students in cultural arts and is now dedicated to the Ranjitkar dance training, with the students practising together nearly every day.“Becoming a Lakhe performer involves more than just wearing the costume and mask,” said Sudin Ranjit, a Lakhe dance student. “We must train extensively with our teachers, and it demands a lot of hard work.”To Ranjit, a resident of Bhaktapur, the training is more than learning a new craft; it is a matter of protecting culture. Growing up only interested in instruments, he slowly understood how important continuing cultural practices like Lakhe dances is for their community.“The dance will not only bolster Bhaktapur’s cultural pride but also boost tourism and create jobs,” says Dr Purushottam Lochan Shrestha, a professor and researcher specialising in Bhaktapur and Newari culture.Shrestha notes that reviving the dance would offer employment to everyone involved, from the dancers and the sculptor making the masks to those participating in the rituals. “Economic centres throughout the city, from small businesses to large industries, will benefit from the influx of tourists attracted by the Lakhe dance,” Shrestha adds, commending the Ranjitkar group's initiative.Once the Ranjitkar community revitalises the Lakhe dance, the Ranjitkar group plans to set up a new Guthi house with a fresh community fund and organise annual events for the dance.“The Lakhe dance won’t let them separate,” Shakya remarks.In today’s globalised world, where identity often merges into a homogenised blend, shared cultural practices provide a sense of connection and belonging. This new Lakhe dance embodies that spirit of togetherness for the community involved.“Reviving the dance after 100 years,” Shakya says, “is about preserving our culture for the next 300 years.” \nThe Lions Club of Kathmandu Corporate, Nepal MD325-D has felicitated various personalities as part of its endeavour to recognise the contribution of the individuals and business entities for the society.As part of its campaign, the Lions Club of Kathmandu honoured Prateek Pradhan with Social Journalism Award, Sylapa T Rimponche with Social Spiritual Award, Erika Gurung with Social Player Award, Ramesh Corporation with Social Corporate House Award, Rajendra Malla with Social Corporate Leader Award and Rajesh Hamal with Social Celebrity Award.Likewise, Chandra Ghimire is honoured with Social Bureaucratic Award, Binod Das with Sports Management Award, Anil Kedia with Social Academic Award, Mohan Ojha with Social Management Award and Surya Nepal with Corporate Social Responsibility Award.The Lionism embarked in Nepal in 1971 as the Lions Club of Biratnagar under the stewardship of former Prime Minister Matrika Prasad Koirala.The Lions Clubs International says it has over 2,000 clubs operating across the nation. \nThe government has declared a public holiday in the Kathmandu Valley on Sunday to celebrate the Bhoto Jatra.On the occasion of the festival, a public holiday has been declared in the three districts of Kathmandu Valley [Kathmandu, Lalitpur, and Bhaktapur], according to a statement by Narayan Prasad Bhattarai, spokesperson for the Ministry of Home Affairs, on Friday.The government announces a public holiday each year on this occasion.The month-long chariot-pulling festival of Rato Machhindranath concludes with the displaying of a bhoto (a jewel-studded vest) at Jawalakhel, Lalitpur. It is an annual cultural and religious ritual of displaying the black jewel-studded vest believed to be of then Nagraj, the serpent King.Machhindranath is revered as the God of rain, good harvest and prosperity. Paying homage to Lord Machhindranath is believed to bring good luck and fulfil one’s wishes. \n: BELLAVITA, India’s leading and most celebrated perfume brand, has announced its official launch in Nepal.The company said the expansion marks a significant milestone in its global growth strategy- gy, bringing its premium fragrance collection closer to the discerning regional consumers.

Officials said that after receiving their suggestions, the draft will be sent to the law and finance ministries before it is tabled at the Cabinet.The bill will be registered in Parliament after the Cabinet’s go-ahead.On March 1, the erstwhile government approved the tourism ministry’s proposal to prepare the draft domestic air carriers’ liability and insurance bill.Nepal adopted the Montreal Convention 1999 (MC99) on December 15, 2018. The MC99, however, makes only international airlines liable in case of passenger death or injury. A year after Nepal adopted the MC99, preparation for adopting a similar kind of law started but could not proceed, although the draft had been prepared.Tourism ministry officials say the process was stalled multiple times as governments changed. Since 2019, when the drafting of the MC99 started, the ministry has welcomed 11 ministers.Since 2019, there have been six fatal plane and helicopter crashes that killed 130 people, and all the families of the victims have been barred from a justifiable compensation that would be $100,000 as per the proposed provisions.The draft, however, is ready. And with a political will, officials expect the registration process to be completed within weeks. The draft bill was extensively discussed with the stakeholders before finalising it in 2020.“But the will to serve the public is rare among politicians. No minister was interested in passing the bill. All they did was stunt. No work,” said a senior official at the ministry.The draft of the air carriers’ liability and insurance bill proposes a fivefold increase in compensation from domestic carriers for death or injury.As per the planned law, domestic airlines have to pay a minimum compensation of $100,000 for the injury or death of a passenger. Currently, the minimum compensation for passenger death on a domestic flight is $20,000.Under the Montreal Convention of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), carriers have to pay 128,821 Special Drawing Rights (SDRs) or ($171,018) if the damage is due to the carrier’s negligence or a wrongful act or omission.SDRs are an interest-bearing international reserve asset used by the International Monetary Fund.Under the Montreal Convention 1999, in any crash, the victims’ families have the right to claim unlimited compensation for a wrongful death.The draft bill states that the carrier should make an advance payment when necessary to meet the immediate economic needs of passengers or victims' families.According to the proposed law, a compensation claim should be filed with the airline or its agents within 60 days of the incident or accident. The carrier’s liability limitation for cargo lost and damaged shall be $20 per kg if the damage was caused or contributed to by the negligence of the airlines, it says. The cargo damage is limited up to $5,000.The compensation for the hand baggage, if lost or damaged, shall be $400.Under the Montreal Convention 1999, effective as of December 28, 2019, a carrier’s liability limitation for cargo lost, damaged or delayed shall be 22 SDRs per kg ($29.21 per kg) in the case of destruction, loss, damage or delay concerning cargo carriage.Carriers must pay 1,288 SDRs ($1,709.90) for each passenger in case of baggage destruction, loss, damage, or delay.Likewise, 5,346 SDRs ($7,097.16) should be compensated for each passenger in relation to damage caused by delay in the carriage of persons.The draft also sets the minimum compensatory damages for the third party. Under the proposed rule, the minimum compensatory damages for the third party by an aircraft weighing 10 tonnes or below shall be $25 million.Similarly, the minimum compensatory damages for the third party by an aircraft weighing up to 35 tonnes shall be $35 million and $60 million for the aircraft weighing above 35 tonnes.However, the domestic carriers have been objecting to a few clauses, such as the carrier’s liability for delays and unlimited compensation, which, according to them, is impractical in a country like Nepal.Airlines officials say that, given Nepal’s geographical terrain, climatic behaviour, and airport facilities, Nepali airlines cannot afford to be liable for delays.According to tourism ministry officials, the proposed legislation is a modified version of the Montreal Convention 1999, as several clauses would be difficult for domestic airlines to comply with.As a result of the delay, 130 passengers who died in different crashes since 2019 missed out on compensation in millions of rupees. \nSherpa Hospitality Group (SHG), a subsidiary of Yeti Group, on Friday celebrated significant milestones and unveiled exciting new ventures. The group said that the special occasion marks the first anniversary of Shinta Mani Mustang—A Bensley Collection, the launch of the new Mountain Lodges of Nepal property in Manang, and the upgrade of Kasara Chitwan.The group launched a new property in Manang under the Mountain Lodges of Nepal brand. This new property joins a collection of 14 family-owned premium lodges, providing guests with exceptional trekking experiences along the Great Himalayan Trails.The group said that for over thirty years, Mountain Lodges of Nepal has provided warmth, welcome, and guidance on trekkers’ journeys. “With a focus on simplicity and recovery, Mountain Lodges of Nepal seeks to honour the mountains and the traditions of mountain hospitality. With our fully-supported trips and accommodations, Mountain Lodges of Nepal strives to make the Himalayas easy to reach, safe, and welcoming for people of all ages.”“Our mission is to redefine high-end tourism along Nepal’s Great Himalayan trails, catering to tourists who seek meaningful journeys and bring quality back to our communities.” \nSeriously ill patients at District Hospital Sankhuwasabha are squeezed into every available space besides the beds: corridors, the floor, chairs, and even the storeroom, and outside on the hospital compound.With the spike in new cases of water-borne, viral fever and vector-borne diseases, mostly dengue, the hospital is struggling to cope.“Every day, around two dozen seriously ill patients end up sleeping on the corridor floor and in other areas,” Dr Pranam Jayaru, medical superintendent at the district hospital, told the Post over the phone from Khandbari, the district headquarters. “Our health workers have been working overtime to provide care, but we lack even the most basic supplies like IV stands. Patients’ visitors have to hold the IV bags or we have to improvise by tying them to windows.”This situation is becoming increasingly common in hospitals in many districts, which are seeing a spike in patient numbers amid a massive dengue outbreak. The virus has spread to 75 of the country’s 77 districts, killing at least three people and infecting 5,119 others since January. Two mountain districts—Humla and Mustang—have yet to record dengue cases this year. “For the last three years, we have witnessed a dengue epidemic during the monsoon season,” said Jayaru. “We can only request our staff to serve extra hours, but cannot provide equipment or expand bed numbers.”Doctors say most patients do not want to be referred to other places, as reaching Dharan, the nearest city, in an ambulance takes over six hours. Holding seriously ill patients in ill-equipped hospitals is risky as they lack consultant doctors, blood transfusion services, and high-tech laboratories, among other things.Experts say the deadly virus outbreak in most mountain districts and all hill districts shows the impact of climate change on Nepal’s healthcare system. Despite these challenges, no effective mitigation measures have been adopted.Many hospitals are overwhelmed by the influx of patients, and health workers are forced to place seriously ill patients in corridors and other makeshift spaces, compromising patient safety.“Our health facilities are not equipped to endure the climate crisis,” said Dr Meghnath Dhimal, chief researcher at the Nepal Health Research Council. “Many are built on hilltops or riverbanks, both vulnerable to climate impacts. These health facilities are also unprepared for emerging problems and spiking patient flow.”Of the 5,119 cases of the dengue cases reported, only 77 cases are from Madhesh Province, which is traditionally an endemic area. Health Ministry officials admit that the disease is shifting towards hills and mountain regions due to climate change. They say other factors, such as increased mobility and improved transportation, are also contributing to the spread of the disease to new areas. “Yes, new challenges have increased in areas previously considered less risky, but we have not strengthened our health facilities to deal with the emerging challenges accordingly,” said Dr Gokarna Dahal, chief of the Vector Control Section at the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division. “Our health system is not is not designed to address these evolving risks.”Dengue is a viral disease transmitted by female Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes. According to the World Health Organization, the same vector also transmits chikungunya, yellow fever, and the Zika virus.In 2023, at least 20 persons died, and more than 52,000 were infected by the virus across the country.In 2022, a total of 88 people died, and over 54,000 were infected by the virus. During that period, hospitals in the Kathmandu Valley were overwhelmed with dengue patients, and pharmacies ran out of paracetamol, the most widely used medicine to treat fever.Back in 2019, dengue killed at least six people and more than 16,000 were hospitalised across the country. The virus had spread to 68 districts at the time.Dengue has become a year-round threat in Nepal over the past few years with cases consistently rising each year.Epidemiologists as well as virologists now consider the dengue virus as a major public health problem in Nepal. They also say that despite thousands of persons getting infected and scores dying from the disease, the authorities have not taken the situation seriously. The lackadaisical approach, they believe, is contributing to the spread of the virus. They call for implementing measures such as search-and-destroy drives and awareness campaigns to control dengue vectors.A report by the United Nations titled “Climate Change 2022: Impacts, Adaptation and Vulnerability” states that at least six major vector-borne diseases have recently emerged in Nepal and are now considered endemic, with climate change implicated as the primary driver.The report also showed increasing evidence that climate change has extended the elevational distribution of Anopheles, Culex and Aedes mosquitoes, which carry viruses to above 2,000 metres in Nepal.Dengue-transmitting mosquitoes breed in clean water and bite people in daylight. Uncovered water tanks and other discarded objects such as plastic cups and bottles could be breeding grounds for the dengue-carrying mosquitoes.Symptoms of dengue include mild to high fever, severe muscle pain, rashes, severe headache and pain in the eyes, doctors say. Patients with these symptoms are advised to seek immediate treatment. While there is no specific cure for the disease, early detection and access to proper medical care can prevent death. \nIn a bid to monitor the nutrition status of the population, the Ministry of Health and Population is planning to carry out a nutrition assessment survey in all districts throughout the country in the ongoing fiscal year.Officials said the nutrition status of pregnant women, children under five, adolescents, and new mothers will be monitored during the survey.“We will first assess the nutrition condition of the people of specific age groups and then share the findings with relevant agencies, including the Ministry of Health and Population,” said Lila Bikram Thapa, chief of the Nutrition Section at the Family Welfare Division under the Department of Health Services. “The nutrition assessment survey is crucial for getting the latest picture of the nutrition status of the population.”Malnutrition is a silent crisis in Nepal. The country has made significant progress in reducing stunting among children under five. According to the Nepal Demographic and Health Survey-2022 report, stunting decreased from 57 percent in 2001 to 25 percent in 2022.Wasting, a debilitating disease that causes muscle and fat tissues to waste away among children under five, decreased from 11 percent in 2001 to eight percent in 2022.Wasting or low weight for one’s height in children, if not treated properly and on time, is associated with a higher mortality risk, according to the World Health Organisation.Even though the health survey report showed some improvement in the country’s overall nutrition status, progress is not the same in all provinces. More than 16 percent of the children under five years in Lumbini Province are found to be suffering from wasting—the most immediate, visible, and life-threatening form of malnutrition.Likewise, around 10 percent of children under the age of five years in Madhesh Province have been found suffering from wasting.Officials said the new study was required to determine the latest progress on the population's nutrition conditions.“The nutrition status of the adolescent population will be monitored by schools, while health facilities will monitor children, pregnant women, and new mothers,” said Thapa. “Health workers will also take classes in schools to educate students about the importance of good nutrition and counsel pregnant women and new mothers at health facilities.”Along with the lack of sufficient nutrient foods, poor sanitation and lack of safe drinking water and treatment are blamed for wasting.Doctors say malnutrition during pregnancy increases the risk of complications and maternal and neonatal deaths, as well as the likelihood of low birth weight. It is a major impediment to growth, affecting human capital and economic productivity of a country.Experts say nutrition is directly linked to the country's overall development. Malnutrition affects children's physical and mental growth, which ultimately affects the country’s economic health.It weakens intellectual capacity, limits productivity in adulthood, and increases vulnerability to certain diseases.Nutritionists ask authorities to promote locally available foods, educate people about the importance of a nutritious diet, and provide fortified flour to improve nutritional conditions and reduce dependency on freely distributed foods.Nepal also has an international obligation to improve the condition of malnourished children.To meet the SDG targets, the country needs to reduce stunting to 15 percent from the current 32 percent by 2030, wasting to four percent from the current eight percent, underweight condition to 10 percent from the existing 19 percent, and anaemia to 10 percent from more than 43 percent at present.The SDGs, a follow-up on the Millennium Development Goals, (MDGs), aim to end poverty, hunger, and all forms of inequality worldwide by 2030, and Nepal has committed to meeting the goals. \nLast week, doctors at Thapathali-based Paropakar Maternity and Women’s Hospital diagnosed a new mother in her late 20s with postnatal depression. Her newborn baby was admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit of the hospital due to health complications, and the mother was under care in the maternity ward.“We had to start her on anti-depressants, as she was showing serious symptoms, including suicidal thoughts,” said Dr Pratikshya Ghimire, a psychiatrist at the hospital. “She felt sad all the time, worried about the newborn's future, and had lost her appetite.” Mental health problems during pregnancy are the second leading cause of maternal deaths, after excessive bleeding during childbirth, also known as postpartum haemorrhage, and pre-eclampsia [pregnancy-related high blood pressure disorders. A report on maternal mortality unveiled last year by the National Statistics Office showed that six percent of maternal deaths were due to self-harm (suicide), with most cases occurring during pregnancy.To address mental health problems during pregnancy, the Ministry of Health and Population has started outpatient care services at the Maternity Hospital.“We have not only started outpatient care but also begun screening inpatients for mental health conditions,” said Dr Ghimire. “We have diagnosed around a dozen and a half patients with serious mental health problems.”According to Dr Ghimire, the woman had an inter-caste marriage, and neither her in-laws nor her own parents accepted her marriage, contributing to her mental health struggles. Several other pregnant women and new mothers have also been found suffering from mental health problems, each at various stages of severity.“The Health Ministry had deputed one psychiatric doctor to our hospital, and we started offering outpatient services after her arrival,” said Dr Shree Prasad Adhikari, the hospital's director. “We are also working on training all hospital staff in mental health screening so that conditions can be diagnosed early. Once mental health problems are identified, patients can be referred to specialists.”Officials hope that screening pregnant women for mental health problems and providing prompt treatment will help reduce maternal deaths, which have been rising alarmingly of late.Doctors say prenatal and postnatal depression can occur at any time during pregnancy or after childbirth. Shifts in hormone levels during pregnancy and after childbirth can significantly affect mood. Many women feel anxious about changes happening to their bodies. Some may even have financial concerns and some worry about taking on new and additional responsibilities.Some women experience extreme sadness, anxiety, fatigue, and changes in sleeping and eating habits during pregnancy or after childbirth. Experts warn that prenatal and postnatal depression along with anxiety and other mental health issues, can lead some women to take their own lives.They also emphasise that excessive bleeding after childbirth, also known as postpartum haemorrhage, pre-eclampsia (pregnancy-related high blood pressure disorders), and suicide are preventable. “Timely screening for mental health problems and proper counselling can significantly reduce the mental health problems faced by pregnant women and new mothers,” said Adhikari. “We have launched this initiative at our hospital, and this is something other hospitals should also implement.”Nepal reduced the maternal mortality rate from 539 per 100,000 births in 1996 to 239 per 100,000 births in 2016. For this, the country also received a Millennium Development Goals award. The 2021 census report showed that in every 100,000 live births, 151 women died from maternity-related complications. According to the report, 88 maternal deaths were prevented in every 100,000 live births between 2016 and 2021. Nepal’s target under the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals is to reduce the maternal mortality rate to 75 per 100,000 births by 2030. \nA World Health Organization official stressed on Tuesday that mpox, regardless of whether it is the new or old strain, is not the new Covid, as authorities know how to control its spread.“We can and must tackle mpox together,” said Hans Kluge, WHO regional director for Europe, in a UN media briefing.“So will we choose to put the systems in place to control and eliminate mpox globally? Or we will enter another cycle of panic and neglect? How we respond now and in the years to come will prove a critical test for Europe and the world,” he added.Mpox, a viral infection that causes pus-filled lesions and flu-like symptoms, is usually mild but can kill.The clade 1b variety has caused global concern because it seems to spread more easily through routine close contact.A case of the variant was confirmed last week in Sweden and linked to a growing outbreak in Africa, the first sign of its spread outside the continent. The WHO declared the recent outbreak of the disease a public health emergency of international concern after the new variant was identified.Kluge said that the focus on the new clade 1 strain will also help in the fight against the less severe clade 2 variety that has spreading globally since 2022, allowing Europe to improve its response through better health advice and surveillance.About 100 new cases of the clade 2 mpox strain are now being reported in the European region every month, added Kluge.Mpox transmits through close physical contact, including sexual contact, but unlike previous global pandemics such as Covid-19, there is no evidence it spreads easily through the air.Health authorities need to be on alert and flexible in case there are new, more transmissible clades or ones that change their transmission route, but there are no recommendations for people to wear masks, said WHO spokesperson Tarik Jasarevic. \nDusit Princess Kathmandu is organising a five-day trout festival at its SOI restaurant. The dishes will be available for order from 12:30 pm to 10:00 pm every day till August 30. In celebration of Nepal’s rivers and lakes, which provide an ideal environment for high-quality trout, the Director of Culinary Food and Beverage Service, Chef Utpal Mondal, and his team at Dusit Princess Kathmandu have crafted a menu showcasing the flavours and versatility of locally sourced trout. “As the festive month of Shrawan ends, people focus on healthy and nutritious food. Trout, rich in omega-3 fatty acids, vitamins, and essential minerals, offers a heart-friendly option that checks all the boxes from a nutritional and culinary standpoint,” says Mondal.He adds that the goal of the culinary event is to offer their guests a rare opportunity to experience a wide variety of trout dishes they wouldn’t typically find at home.The event menu features twelve unique dishes, six of which are drawn from diverse culinary traditions across continents. Three dishes are inspired by oriental cuisine, while the remaining three highlight flavours from Nepal and India. The menu has been designed to include various dishes, from soups and starters to main courses, including Mexican, Italian, Continental, and Thai flavours.While discussing the event’s highlights, Mondal said, “The celebration presents a unique opportunity for guests to indulge in a diverse range of trout-based dishes, something they wouldn’t typically have the chance to experience elsewhere.” \nI can vividly remember my first encounter with baking when I was 10 years old. We had just moved to our new home and got a cable connection. The cable opened a world of possibilities, as it gave me access to various contents.This was back in the late 2000s when YouTube would take hours to load, taunting us with its buffering screen. I was particularly drawn to travel and lifestyle channels, mainly TLC, Fox Life, and Food Network, which kept me informed about different foods and cultures. I don’t know why, but I was always drawn to desserts. It was fascinating to see how these miraculous treats made people smile at the end of the meal.Growing up in Nepal, I noticed that baking wasn't very common. While some families did have ovens, they were mostly multifunctional ones used primarily for heating food.I also noticed that most of our desserts didn't require an oven, as they could be made on a stovetop. So, you can imagine my excitement when my mom decided to buy an oven during one of her festive shopping sprees.I could finally feel the joy these channels portrayed. (I blame food writer Nigella Lawson for getting me hooked on a domestic lifestyle.) Then, one day, after watching one of the cooking episodes on television, I finally mustered enough strength and decided to bake something. I distinctly remember wanting to make a chocolate cake for myself after watching one of Rachel Allen’s bake series. I watched all the ingredients used in that recipe and scurried across my pantry, only to realise I didn’t have half of the stuff she mentioned. I then decided to improvise the recipe (a big mistake). I randomly combined the ingredients that I had in a mixing bowl and chucked the batter into my oven, hoping for a magical cake to pop out an hour later.After I saw the result an hour later, I was mortified. The cake was stuck in the pan, refusing to come out, and it was as dense as fudge. I convinced myself that the taste was what mattered most, but when I served a slice to my brother, he made a face of utter disgust.That was the day I realised that baking soda was not the same as baking powder.After this incident, I researched baking and found out it was technical. This was a blessing in disguise for me, as I loved science, and I started to view baking as a science experiment. I then reflected and evaluated how to perfect one's baking skills.I analysed my errors and noted down all the steps I did every time I baked. Home baking is a passion for many. The idea of turning a few simple ingredients into a delicious masterpiece is as enchanting as it sounds.Yet, for many of us, this seemingly magical process can often turn into a series of unfortunate events, leading to crumbled dreams and deflated ambitions. Dense cakes, burnt crusts, rock-hard cookies and unrisen bread, if you are an amateur baker, then you have seen it all. But why do these mishaps happen so often? And most importantly how do we overcome them?From my experience, behind every successful bake lies a series of challenges and mishaps that test even the most dedicated bakers. Baking has its own set of rules that you need to follow to get that scrumptious treat every time. So, to transform a recipe into an actual dish that will impress your friends and family, I am sharing with you some of the tips and tricks I learned from my tumultuous journey as a home baker.First things first, we have to look into the prime appliance that we are working with. Commercial ovens are of two types: one that runs on gas and the other that runs on electricity. We have to look at the oven present at our home and consider its pros and cons. The main benefits of a gas oven are its size and temperature control. One can quickly change the temperature just by twisting the knob, and it preheats much more quickly than an electric one. However, they are known to have uneven temperatures at times and release more humidity, making it harder to properly crisp or brown food. This can result in burnt edges and cold or hot spots. An electric oven, on the other hand, provides more even and consistent temperatures and doesn’t release as much moisture in the air.This dry oven environment makes it easier to brown your items, making it great for baking bread. However, while the dry oven results in more even cooking, you also run the risk of drying out cakes and other baked goods.Also, many people forget to preheat the oven before baking, which is crucial for maintaining an even temperature throughout the baking process. When baking cakes and bread, I like to place a small tray of water at the bottom of the oven to provide moisture and prevent the baked goods from drying out.An oven thermometer can be a baker's best friend, providing a true reading and ensuring your creations bake evenly. I also like rotating the pan midway while baking, as it allows for an even distribution of heat.The next thing people mess up on is measuring and the specificity of ingredients in a recipe. Our moms made our food with their instinct; it is something that they learned along the way, but when you are baking, you cannot instinctively add or omit a few steps.I think that is why we initially had problems with baking. In a culture where cooking comes instinctually, baking challenges us, to be precise. A gram of more or less of any ingredient can drastically alter the outcome. Different methods of measuring flour can yield different results.Every component in baking serves a distinct purpose and function. Flour offers structure, sugar adds sweetness and moisture, eggs bind things together, and butter enhances taste and texture. However, not all ingredients are created equally. For example, using salted butter instead of unsalted might change the taste profile of your meal.Similarly, different flours have varying protein concentrations, which affect the texture of baked goods. The type of sugar used also makes a difference. Granulated sugar, brown sugar, powdered sugar, and speciality sugars like turbinado or muscovado each add unique flavours to a bake.Understanding these nuances and how they interact is critical for getting the intended outcomes. Accurate measurement tools and techniques are essential, but mastering them can be a steep learning curve. So, I would recommend investing in a kitchen scale that allows for more accurate measurements by weight rather than volume.Moving on, leavening agents such as baking soda, baking powder, and yeast are required to make baked goods rise. However, they can also cause confusion and errors. Baking soda needs an acidic component to activate, but baking powder has both an acid and a base, making it self-activating.Using the wrong type of flour or sugar, or using them in incorrect proportions, can result in flat, overly raised, or collapsed cakes. Yeast, being a living organism, presents its challenges.The water temperature must be just right—not too hot to kill the yeast, nor too cold to inhibit its activity. Proofing times and conditions also need to be carefully managed to achieve the perfect rise.Bakers should also be careful about the way they mix ingredients. The method of mixing ingredients can significantly impact the final product. Over-mixing can develop too much gluten in cakes and pastries, leading to tough textures.Under-mixing can leave pockets of unincorporated ingredients, resulting in uneven bakes. Techniques like folding, creaming, and whipping each serve specific purposes and must be executed with care.Finally, home bakers must understand the importance of timing and patience in baking. Even a minute or two can make the difference between perfectly baked cookies and burnt edges.Recipes often provide a range for baking times, but factors like oven hot spots, pan material, and altitude can affect these times. It’s crucial to keep a close eye on your bakes and rely on visual and tactile cues, such as a cake pulling away from the sides of the pan or a toothpick coming out clean, to determine doneness.Baking is also an exercise in patience, a virtue not everyone possesses. Doughs need time to rest and rise, flavours need time to meld, and baked goods need time to cool before they can be enjoyed.Impatience can lead to underbaked centres, crumbling slices, and a general sense of frustration. Cultivating patience is as important as mastering any technique in the baker’s repertoire.Home baking is a journey full of ups and downs, but it comes with great rewards. The obstacles encountered teach valuable lessons in patience, precision, and perseverance.The satisfaction of success, the freedom to create, and the therapeutic benefits make the endeavour meaningful. Whether baking for oneself, loved ones, or as an artistic outlet, the journey is as fulfilling as the result. Embrace the flour-dusted countertops, occasional setbacks, and the joys of home bakingFor a beginner-friendly recipe that involves mixing ingredients and delivers amazing results, try my recipe for fudgy, nutty brownies that I call ‘Bliss Brownies’.Bliss Brownies150g unsalted butter plus extra for the tin150g chopped dark chocolate200g caster sugar½ tsp baking powder2 eggs80g cocoa powder150g plain flour70g mixture of nuts (walnuts and almonds)60g blended papayaMix all the ingredients (except the dark chocolate and nuts) in a blender or a food processor and blitz till you get a smooth paste.Fold the chocolate and the nuts into the brownie batter, making sure that the pieces are evenly mixed in.Grease a loaf pan with soft butter and dust with cocoa powder. Pour the batter into the loaf pan.Bake in a preheated oven at 170c for 40 minutes and let it cool in the oven for an hour. Enjoy with a cup of coffee or, as I like it, a scoop of vanilla ice cream. \nIn a world where acceptance and safety often seem difficult to attain, many queer individuals also struggle to find a safe space to express themselves. They have to hide their true self and face relentless judgement when going to public places like cafes and restaurants.This is the reality for countless LGBTQIA+ individuals. The need for a safe space for this community is not just a desire but a necessity—a space where one can be themselves. This struggle for safety and acceptance can be traced to crucial historical moments, such as the Stonewall Riots of 1969 in New York City.The Stonewall Inn was more than a bar; it was a refuge for the queer community. When police raided the bar, the community fought back. This series of violent confrontations, which began in the early hours of June 28, 1969, between police and gay rights activists, marked the beginning of the modern LGBTQIA+ rights movement. The spirit of Stonewall, the fight for dignity and the right to exist openly lives on in places like Inclusive Galaxy Restaurant in Kathmandu. Inclusive Galaxy beyond a restaurant is an ‘oasis’ for the queer community and beyond.Founded by Bishwaraj Adhikari, Mr Gay Handsome Nepal 2013, a human rights defender, the restaurant proves the power of safe spaces. It’s a place where the community can unite, free from the prejudice and hostility that often permeate their everyday lives.After years of working in the human rights sector, Adhikari and his partner developed the idea for Inclusive Galaxy. What began as a small cafe gradually evolved into a full-fledged restaurant, driven by the growing demand and support from the community.“In developed countries with strong LGBTQIA+ movements, you can find community areas like gay villages. These are created as safe spaces for people whose families and communities have excluded them. They also support new business ideas and pink tourism. I hope to see pink tourism develop in Nepal someday,” says Adhikari. His vision for Inclusive Galaxy goes beyond just being a restaurant. He aims to promote financial independence and empowerment within the queer community.Since its inception in February 2019, Inclusive Galaxy has become a key spot for many in Lazimpat, a relatively queer-friendly area in Kathmandu. The location is essential because the first LGBTQIA+ movement in Nepal started in 2001 through the Blue Diamond Society.Inclusive Galaxy, true to its name, welcomes everyone—queer and non-queer alike—to share a comfortable space. His vision was clear: to create a space where people of all genders and sexual identities could come together without fear of exclusion.“I didn’t want to make it exclusively for queer people because that would be excluding ourselves from society. Different groups need to live together and understand each other,” Adhikari explains.In the early days, the cafe attracted both queer and non-queer customers. However, when some of the residents learned about Adhikari’s identity and the nature of the clientele, there was a brief period of hesitation. “At first, I didn’t understand what was happening, but then I realised my identity was an issue for a few people. I believe people should be judged by others by their character, not by their gender or sexuality. Over time, as residents saw that we operated like any other cafe, they became more comfortable,” Adhikari reflects.Adhikari started Inclusive Galaxy to give queer individuals a place to be proud of themselves, counteracting the self-doubt and insecurity that hiding one’s identity can cause. This turned the cafe very quickly into a community hub. The journey was not without challenges, though. It was difficult to hire staff and cooks from the LGBTQIA+ community, and soon after the restaurant opened, the COVID pandemic made things even harder.Despite these difficulties, the doors of Inclusive Galaxy remained open. During the pandemic, many queer individuals, who were abandoned by their families or afraid to return home, found comfort at Inclusive Galaxy.Since many couldn’t afford to pay for meals, the restaurant provided free food from its resources. As the number of people needing meals grew to 20-30 daily, Adhikari started raising funds within the community.“During my time as an activist, many people came here not only for food but also to see an organisation where the queer community supports one another,” Adhikari says.“The time during COVID was difficult, but it brought me closer to the community.”Four years after its inception, the restaurant has garnered a loyal following. Sarosy Neupane, Miss Pink Nepal 2024 first runner-up, describes Inclusive Galaxy as her second home. She moved to Kathmandu to study in 2022. Being distant from her family, she started visiting Galaxy for meals that reminded her of home-cooked food. Over time, she grew attached to the café because of its welcoming atmosphere.“It’s heartwarming to see people from our community and different walks of life here. The founders even invite us to festivals like ‘Dahi Chiura Khane din,’” she shares.Neupane visits the cafe regularly and sometimes stays until 3 am, engrossed in conversations. “I hope more spaces like this can open in the future. If, unfortunately, this place were to close someday, I don’t think we’d have any other place to turn to,” she adds.Muna Chhetri, a trans woman who has been a loyal customer for three years, shares, “This is my safe space where I can truly be myself. I always feel judged in other restaurants, but that fear doesn’t exist here. It’s where even those who aren’t accepted at home can feel accepted.”Sahara Khadka Chhetri, owner of Pink Tiffany, Kathmandu’s first openly LGBTIQIA+ friendly restaurant and bar, frequently visits after managing the bar, appreciating the convenience of not cooking at home.She notes very few places like this cater to our community, and some even had to close during COVID. “As an entrepreneur, I know that sustaining these spaces is a challenge. But as more spaces like these open, they will make the way for a more inclusive and compassionate society.”The welcoming atmosphere at Inclusive Galaxy has also had a surprising effect on non-queer patrons. Samriddha Jung Rana, a twenty-year-old neighbour who identifies as straight, often visits the café and appreciates the importance of such spaces.“Previously, I didn’t know much about the queer community and didn’t care much. But now, coming into this café, I’ve been interested in their rights and issues. I’ve realised that we’re not so different after all. We are all human,” he remarks.The ventures like Inclusive Galaxy and Pink Tiffany have inspired hope for collaborative businesses between queer and non-queer groups. The recent initiative by the Nepal Tourism Board promoting Pink Tourism in April 2024 is a positive step. Still, Adhikari believes that more support is needed from the government and the private sector.Despite the progress, challenges remain. However, Adhikari remains optimistic about the future. He is working on plans to develop the restaurant into a homestay program in the future.“Like how different planets, asteroids, and stars make up a beautiful galaxy, people from all walks of life and identities make a beautiful society. I am happy that we are assimilating together in this space. We are not so different; we are all different and similar simultaneously,” he says. \nAditya Mishra is a Nepali chef and entrepreneur based in New York. Passionate about elevating Nepali cuisine globally, Mishra sharpened his culinary skills while staging at various Michelin-starred restaurants in the city during his time at culinary school. A recipient of the James Beard Foundation National Scholars Scholarship in 2023, Mishra’s early experiences inspired him to establish his own supper club, ‘The Sewing Tin’, alongside co-founder Akhil Upad.In an interview with Post’s Aarati Ray, Mishra discusses his restaurant in New York, serving Nepali cuisines there and the recipe for his signature dish.How did your cooking journey start in New York?At 14, I told my parents I wanted to be a chef, but they preferred I pursue a stable career like engineering, as many Nepali families do. So, I left for Louisiana in 2019 to study engineering.But, cooking never left my heart so, after a year, I left engineering college and moved to New York City. It’s been three and a half years and my parents only learned about it later. When my mom visited me in NYC and saw my dedication to cooking, she saw my passion and supported my decision.What sparked your interest in cooking from a young age?As a child, I was drawn to cooking shows on TLC. The glamour of cooking, eating, travelling and the prosperity of famous chefs was fascinating.Around age 16, I discovered Chef Anthony Bourdain’s groundbreaking book, ‘Kitchen Confidential’, which shed light on the reality of the culinary industry. I learned how he became a cultural icon in NYC, reshaping perceptions of chefs.I was also fascinated by chefs like Marco Pierre White, who was a mentor to Gordon Ramsay. Their stories of achieving fame while maintaining discipline intrigued me. But, as I grew older and entered the culinary world, I realised it was far from glamorous—it involved dedication and I am glad I persevered.How did the idea for The Sewing Tin originate?The concept of ‘The Sewing Tin’ came when I realised the stark contrast between the romanticised view of kitchen work and its harsh reality. Witnessing the struggles of many kitchen staff—economic hardships, immigration challenges and language barriers—I had to rediscover my love for cooking.During my internship at ‘Junoon’ restaurant, I met my co-founder, Akhil Upad, who shared my culinary enthusiasm despite his preparations for medical college. Together, we wanted to create a dining experience that was more personal and communal, offering fine dining with a sense of community.We wanted our food to tell stories, so we named our restaurant ‘The Sewing Tin’ inspired by the immigrant experience in NYC. When immigrants opened cookie boxes as kids, they often found sewing supplies instead of food.‘The Sewing Tin’ is like opening a cookie box and finding sewing supplies—something uniquely desi, or South Asian. How do you promote Nepali cuisine in New York City through The Sewing Tin?My partner is from Atlanta with Indian roots, while I come from Nepal, so our menu celebrates and reflects both cultures and heritage.We represent our respective cultures authentically. For example, we have a dish inspired by Newari cuisine called kachaila, similar to French Tartar. We present it as Tartar to make it accessible to our customers but infuse it with Nepali flavours, telling stories about its origins and giving diners a taste of my homeland.What do you think of the prospects of Nepali cuisine abroad?I’m on a mission to share Nepali food worldwide. I have served up dishes like chatamari and lamb sekuwa in my restaurant. But I’m still learning and want to explore more of Nepal’s cuisines. My big dream? To make Nepali cuisine reach more places because it’s got something special that can wow taste buds everywhere.How do you see the changes in restaurants in Nepal?The restaurant industry has deep roots in community and bringing people together, dating back centuries. While this core idea remains, modern restaurants have evolved, making changes to adapt to the times.Yet, in Nepal, despite the growing number of restaurants, many lack uniqueness and storytelling, focusing more on making money than fostering a sense of community.I’ve noticed a troubling trend of rising prices, especially for beloved dishes like momos, which makes people question if they're getting value for their money. It seems like profits are taking precedence over creating genuine, authentic culinary experiences.The industry is starting to lose the creativity and passion that once made it special. It might be time for chefs to shake things up, challenge the norm and bring fresh ideas to the table, revitalising the culinary scene with renewed energy and creativity.What challenges have you faced in New York as an outsider?Living in a bustling city like New York as an outsider has its challenges. But, this city is also full of opportunities for those who are passionate. If you stay true to your culture and want to share your story, opportunities are waiting for you.Even though it can be daunting because of the tough competition, the city appreciates determination and expertise. When I started my journey here, all I wanted to do was cook, eat and share the story of Nepal and its diverse cultures. Instead of focusing on the difficulties, I embraced the chance to follow my passion.What do you think about the criticism of blending Nepali food with modern culinary styles?Chefs care about their food—it’s like they’re sharing a story. They’ve put in a lot of effort to become skilled, so let them be creative. It’s okay to give helpful advice but don’t be mean just to criticise. Chefs shouldn’t also just copy what’s popular, they should cook what they truly love. That’s what makes food special and meaningful.Mishra’s signature dish:Confit Duck Chatamari A traditional Nepali delicacy with French influence.Ingredients:Duck (Legs and breast)Rice (soaked overnight)MayonnaiseWhole spices (cloves, cinnamon, cardamom, bay leaf)Red onionGarlicGingerMula ko achar (Fermented radish)ScallionsLemon juiceNepali pepperVinegarSaltSugarProcedure:For the Duck:Season duck with salt and pepper.Cook in a covered pan with whole spices, garlic, and ginger at low heat for 2 hours on a stove (270 degrees in the oven)Increase heat to crisp up the skin (approximately 15 minutes).Shred the duck meat.Confit Garlic Aioli:Mash cooked garlic and ginger and mix with mayonnaise, lemon juice, Nepali pepper and fermented radishes.Pickled Onions:Slice onions and cook in a mixture of vinegar, water, salt, sugar, and whole spices until softened (about 10 minutes).For the chatamari:Blend soaked rice to make a batter, let it ferment for 6 hours, and adjust consistency with water.Assembling:Cook chatamari batter in duck fat for 4 minutes.Top with shredded duck, aioli, pickled onions and scallions.Serve \nCeleus Baral exudes a serene aura when you meet her, and when she tells you she bakes, it makes sense. Even during a brief encounter, you can tell she has the patience needed to be a baker.“You can eyeball cooking, but baking is chemistry. You have to be meticulous. You cannot rush it, or it does not turn out as expected,” says the 21-year-old environment science student. She also runs the online baking shop Bakeleus. Recently, she has also started selling her baked goods beyond her online shop, with her first stall appearing at The Yellow House’s Night Market. Bakeleus’s menu lists a variety of offerings, including jams, granola, tarts, cakes, cookies, cupcakes and brownies. Baral began baking in 2020, during the lockdown, and launched her online shop last year.She grows much of the produce she incorporates into her baking, and believes we should all understand the origins of our food. “This connection fosters gratitude and a deeper appreciation for nature,” she says. Her background in environmental science, coupled with her affinity for the natural world, imbues her creations with a unique artistic sensibility. Each item she bakes is a testament to her creativity and experimentation, as she believes consistent practice is the key to mastery.Despite the demands of being a full-time student, Baral strives to accommodate orders, typically requiring a minimum of 72 hours' notice for delivery. She is a passionate and discerning individual, evident in the love she infuses into her baking. Additionally, Baral advocates for a zero-waste policy at home, ensuring that every scrap of food and all household items are recycled.Three easy to bake recipes you can try at homeMini carrot cakes Ingredients:38 g milk or yoghurt35 g all-purpose flour1/4 tea spoon ground cinnamon1/8 tea spoon ground gingerA pinch of cardamom1 tea spoon baking powder½ tea spoon fine sea salt2 large eggs, at room temperature27 g granulated sugar13 g brown sugar (or 39 g of regular granulated sugar)1 tea spoon vanilla extract27 g extra virgin olive oil33 g carrots, peeled and shreddedChopped walnutsCandied lemon or orange slices (optional for garnish)Cream cheese frosting56.5 g unsalted butter, softened113.5 g cream cheese, softened1/2 teaspoon vanilla extractA pinch of salt250 g powdered sugarDirections:For the cake:Preheat the oven to 195°C.

Yet, pockets of the past remain—small, peaceful neighbourhoods where houses are still made of wood, paths are made of stone tiles, and the stillness of a world that wants to stay intact and immobile. These places are known for tourism, culture, and the restoration of community pride. One such stop is the quiet village of Khokana in southern Lalitpur.Khokana is comparatively close to the mainland urban Lalitpur; from the ring road junction of Bagdole, it takes only a 10-minute drive to reach there. From the airport, you can take a cab directly to Khokana, which will take around half an hour. Get your cameras and hiking boots ready; the area is filled with historical artefacts and hiking trails.However, it is vastly different from the city. It is much nearer to the hills, where stone-paved paths, which could easily be goat trails, are rare in today’s Kathmandu.One such goat trail leads to Sikali temple, a major attraction of the area and accessible only on foot. The pavements are lined with big and small temples on each side, along with ponds that serve as clean water sources and a location for religious rituals. The houses are made of bricks and wood. The concrete invasion, although present, is minimal. Scattered every few hundred metres are small mustard oil mills, co-operative businesses of the locals of Khokana that have existed since medieval times.A site well-recognised for its historical significance, Khokana was even proposed to be made a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1996. Sikali TempleAround an hour’s walk from the historic town, Sikali Temple can be reached, which is also the location for its famed Sikali Jatra.While it can be reached through any public vehicle, a more holistic and adventurous route is to follow the goat trails on the outskirts of Khokana. This route, albeit long, allows for great hiking opportunities, scenic views of the hills surrounding the Kathmandu Valley, and a close-up view of the mediaeval but well-maintained architecture of the local houses.Even if you lose the way, which is very possible, the locals are very welcoming and more than willing to guide you. The main temple itself is three stories tall, and built in the Pagoda style, a common style in many temples in the valley.It is surrounded by a lush grass field which plays the stage to the Sikali Jatra held every year. The temple, like many religious spots around Khokana, is dedicated to the local deity Shree Rudrayani.The Sikali Jatra, a five-day festival that serves as an alternative to Dashain for the Khokana locals, is filled with chariot dances, battle enactments, and storytelling celebrations in the worship of Goddess Rudrayani.Starting from Ghatasthapana in mid to late September, the Jatra is vibrant and an essential experience for every visitor. Historical Khokana townKhokana’s historical town is located around 5 minutes walking distance from the local bus park. The town complex, paved with hand-made stone tiles, is graced with the Indrayanee temple but also has many red-bricked houses built in the local Newari architecture, some of them centuries old.One such house is the ‘Khokana Museum’. Although closed, it is widely popular for being the first house to be lit with electricity in Nepal, as Chandra Shamsher did in 1911.The stand-holder of the first light bulb can still be seen, serving as a historical monument for everyone to see.Similarly, the town complex is also filled with Guthi houses, small ponds, and even the local Ward office. While the Ward office provides a wealth of information for visitors interested in the area’s history, the Guthi halls symbolise the strong community support culture of the locals.The ponds, a notable one present right opposite the Indrayanee temple, have stone taps and remind us of primitive ways of obtaining clean water—a practice many locals are still engaged in.Yet, these ponds are also religious locations, especially used in rituals in the Sikali Jatra.Finally, a stroll through the complex allows visitors to explore old houses and historical artefacts in the serene quietness of Khokana, while the small outlets and Choila places nearby allow you to enjoy the spicy duck or chicken delicacies at the same time.Overall, the historical complex is enough to transport visitors back to a glimpse of the medieval past of the Kathmandu Valley. Mustard oil millsThe most well-known feature of Khokana is its mustard oil mills, which have been operational for hundreds of years and have been using the same methods of preparation since their inception.These mills, scattered throughout Khokana, are often community-owned, and even the ones owned by certain individuals have almost exclusively employed locals.Despite the advent of modern machinery, there is still substantial demand for their products due to the assured guarantee.When I visited one such mill, the local staff informed me that the furnace and oil presser used by them were 300 years old, given by the Patan royalty even before the Shahs became king.In addition to buying pure, organically created mustard oil and pellets, visiting these oil mills offers many educational benefits for international and local tourists alike.Khokana offers visitors a unique glimpse into a preserved bubble of the past through its tranquillity, preservation of ancient lifestyle and cultural elements, and remarkable self-sustenance.  \n“How much oxygen do you have for the summit?”I think this is the kind of question a film producer would ask. But when you're on the mountain, the answer is never clear.I have worked for a long time in the film industry and different art areas, especially photography and engraving.Working in various fields and drawing inspiration from them has become a new normal for me. I have made this approach my way of life without even realising it.I took responsibility for producing the last movie I worked on and shot the behind-the-scenes footage for a documentary. By doing so, I witnessed the entire shooting process and the journey of a movie.In the snowy highlands of Turkey, we had to endure the consequences of the changing climate to shoot ‘About Dry Grasses’, directed by Nuri Bilge Ceylan. The highlands used to be snowy in January, but by the time we got there in the same month, there was no snow. Nature was changing. It was responding to what was happening—to what humanity had done to it. In the end, it snowed, and we shot the intense snow scenes we wanted. But since most of our days were sunny, unlike what the director wanted, we had to shoot in the sunset and sunrise hours. As crew members, we spent many days waiting for the sun to set.Production requires creating opportunities, finding solutions, and being creative for a work of art to come true. For this, patience, endurance, calmness, and timing are necessary. On the other hand, nature wanted us to listen to it and wait for the right time.During that time, I witnessed many of nature's lessons. For example, I experienced extreme cold for the first time. We endured temperatures ranging from -33 degrees to +55 degrees. By listening to nature, surrendering to its forces, and working within its limits, we managed to persevere.No matter how much you prepare or plan during the pre-production phase, if you are working in nature, remember that nature will always have the final say.The film was completed, released, and connected with audiences. Its success at Cannes 2023 was followed by my trip to the North Pole for my project. I returned with a mix of wonderful developments, joys, and challenges. During this process, I experienced life and death, happiness and sadness, losses and awards.I realised the value of being able to breathe comfortably a few days after my father's chemotherapy ended. Just a few days earlier, he had said, \"Well done, my daughter. I'm glad you went!\" All the anxiety and hard work, filled with fears at the beginning, were finally behind me.Before going to Everest, when I was on the verge of giving up, defeated by my fears, I remembered my father's words. Everest reminded me of what he said while struggling to breathe, adding a turning point to my life.What does it mean to say ‘life’s turning point?’ How many turning points can there be in life?Who am I, and what am I doing in this world? How well do I know my own limits? Can I find answers to these big questions? These thoughts sparked my dream of journeying to Everest. Now, after returning, I can say that it turned my life around.“How much oxygen do you need for the summit?” sounds more like “How much do you need to hold on to life?” How many reasons do you find that give meaning to your life, keep you alive, and allow you to breathe? How much can you endure in the face of obstacles, and can you keep believing that a solution will eventually come your way?Can these questions be separated from the idea of measuring and assessing something, from learning its quantity and financial value? Can everything be known with certainty? Should the journey be fully understood in advance, with all its promises laid out? Should it be viewed like a purchase with a price tag, asking, “Is this journey worth this much?”I had never trekked before and had no climbing experience. I had lived at sea level my entire life and had never been to a high altitude.However, this journey was not only about the physical climb but also an inner discovery. After losing my father to lung cancer, his breathing difficulties taught me the fragility of breath, life, and existence. I also mentally prepared myself for the physical challenges I might face. Despite all my concerns, could this journey help me understand the cycle of life and the resilience of the soul?So, how could I make this trek possible? How could I land in Nepal? Despite all the economic difficulties and the many things I felt needed organising, I did my best and believed in it.Since I was embarking on this journey, I felt I should share about my travels and inspire others.Starting with photography, cinema, and engraving, which are already integral parts of my life, I dreamed of documenting and sharing the inspiring aspects of this journey.After months of correspondence and dreaming, it all came true. Finally, I embarked on the journey with the goal of creating photographs, engravings, and documentaries. I learned a great deal from my travels in Nepal, from the people I met, and from every moments I witnessed. I felt incredibly fortunate to have been able to honour my father’s memory with the peace and serenity I experienced in the Himalayas.During my 15-day journey to Everest Base Camp, I encountered nature’s masterpieces at every turn. As concerns like “How will I endure?” and “How will I finish?” started to weigh on me, the mountains suddenly parted with the clouds and gazed down at me.It was amazing to witness the appearance of ‘Gods’ that I had never seen before, in such immense size and in such a close, awe-inspiring manner beside me during that silent walk.As someone who came from one of the most crowded cities in the world, Istanbul, while I struggled with my daily questions and uncertainties, trying to control everything, they stood there calmly, as if answering me.They were just there—before and after.My guide, Lakhpa Sherpa, always reminded me not to worry about how high we were, how long it would take to reach our accommodation, or what the weather would be like. He encouraged me to live in the moment, and he was right.He advised me to focus on my breathing, not to get thirsty, to eat enough, and to appreciate the extraordinary beauty of the journey. In the mountains, plans dissolve and each moment is embraced as it comes.All the good wishes, prayers, and everything encountered along the way were for the journey itself. The mountain was full of life, secrets, and everything I had wondered about.This 15-day journey to Everest Base Camp was a solo adventure, yet I wouldn't have been able to complete it without my guide, Lhakpa, and my porter. Additionally, I was fortunate enough to experience the hospitality, generosity, and honesty at Trekkers Paradise, which organised the entire journey and provided guidance.I witnessed how dedication and sincerity are crucial in completing a journey safely and healthily. Ghanshyam Sharma, from Trekkers Paradise and Sauraj Jhingan, a climber who summited the Everest in 2018, shared their experiences with me during the journey.They experienced the 2015 earthquake while they were at the Everest Base Camp.As a filmmaker, their role as actors, and attention to detail played a significant role in bringing my dream photography and documentary project to life.The sponsors of my journey were Turkish Airlines, The North Face, Apple, Canon, and Stanley. My supporters include Oscar International College and Nepal Film Campus. Throughout the journey, I shared many experiences, memories, and countless photos and images with my students.On my way back home after 21 days, I celebrated my birthday on the plane. From the right window, the Himalayas bid me farewell. I felt like I had opened a new chapter in my life, and I was certain that I would return.I had made many friends and memories in Nepal.For now, I will be working on a documentary and preparing for a photography and engraving exhibition titled ‘My Soul Beyond the Mountain’.To the Himalayas: This summer was spent with you, but we will meet again soon. \nWe spent five days in Sri Lanka two weeks ago, driving up and down the island, covering almost 70 percent of its territory. Our tour spanned over 1,000 kilometres, including hills, beach spots, and heritage and religious sites.Our first stop in Sri Lanka was Colombo’s Bandaranaike International Airport. We were greeted by a warm and humid breeze when we exited the airport. The host briefed us (a group of journalists) that heavy rainfall has affected areas across Sri Lanka since mid-May 2024. Rain and storms intensified on June 1, with the most significant effects in the south and west of the country. We were lucky to have no rain in the forecast.On the first night, we checked into the lavish Jetwing Lake resort, an opulent sanctuary amidst the lush landscape. The resort’s expansive grounds were a retreat, offering a glimpse of Sri Lanka's natural beauty. We feasted on delicious cuisine, every bite exploding with flavour, introducing us to the island’s famed culinary delights. On June 7, early morning, the sun shone brightly, previewing the promise of an incredible journey ahead. We set off early the following day, eager to explore the mysteries of this enchanting island. As we ventured further into the heart of Sri Lanka, the landscape revealed its majestic nature. We were astounded by seeing Pidurangala Rock, a 200-metre-high granite colossus just a kilometre north of Sigiriya. The short hike to Pidurangala Rock offered breathtaking views of Sigiriya and beyond. We climbed the steep steps and soon were rewarded with a breathtaking panoramic view of the surrounding landscape. It took us 30 minutes to climb. The sight took our breaths away and left us humbled in the presence of such grandeur. From the top are glorious vistas of the surrounding landscape and an incredible view of the majestic Sigiriya Rock. From there, Sigiriya Lion’s Rock is visible, standing alone. This was the place where demon king Ravana had his palace in the Treta Yuga. Believed to have been built 50 centuries ago, the palace is said to have had a unique lift for Ravana and his visitors. Ravana imprisoned Sita in one of the caves at the bottom of this humongous boulder. Sigiriya is a fifth-century fortress in Sri Lanka carved out of an inselberg, a hill of hard volcanic rock that soared high above the surrounding jungle. We spent two hours atop the rock, mainly taking photographs. We descended from Pidurangala Rock, filled with awe and a sense of accomplishment.The journey ahead seemed even more enticing as we ventured along the winding roads, heading towards our next destination.Cash-strapped Sri Lanka plunged into its worst financial crisis in more than seven decades in 2022, with a severe dollar shortage sending inflation soaring to a high of 70 percent, its currency to record lows, and its economy contracting 7.3 percent.Thanks to the growing number of tourists, Sri Lanka is now bouncing back.In Jetwing Lake, we met Kasun Pradeep Somasiri, a receptionist. He briefed us that the resort is now 50 percent occupied. “That’s a better figure now as we are recovering.”The travel and tourism sector is a significant income generator for Sri Lanka. However, the economic crisis, the Ukraine–Russia war, and China’s zero-Covid policy have jeopardised the industry.Tourism accounted for more than 12 percent of the country’s GDP in 2019 and was the third-largest source of foreign exchange reserves, behind worker remittances and the apparel industry.Sri Lanka was poised to be one of the world’s best holiday destinations due to its rich culture, wealth of natural resources, and diversity of accessible experiences.However, tourism-dependent Sri Lanka suffered its first major setback with the Easter bombings 2019. This led to the collapse of inbound tourism flows as international arrivals declined by 18 percent year-on-year, and tourist expenditure fell by 17.7 percent that year. This was immediately followed by two years of pandemic restrictions. Inbound visitors fell to just 116,600 in 2021.An acute balance of payments crisis forced Sri Lanka to preemptively default on foreign debt of over $50 billion in April 2022, triggering a crippling economic contraction with spiralling inflation.“Tourism is gaining momentum,” says Somasiri. “The British and Chinese have started to return to Sri Lanka.”January-August is the peak season for foreigners. “From December to April, local people travel for holiday purposes,” says Somasiri. Before we started the tour to other religious sites, our tour guide, Sampath Mayadunne, told us, “Don't take selfies with your back to Buddha.” Turning your back on a Buddha statue and some other religious sites to take photos and videos is a strict no-no.The most common sight across Sri Lanka is the tank cascades system, an ancient irrigation infrastructure. The system is a network of small tanks draining to large reservoirs that store rainwater and surface runoff for later use.“These infrastructures were built by its ancient kings over 2,000 years ago to solve the water scarcity in the country’s dry zone,” says Mayadunne.On day two, we travelled to Ranweli Spice Garden in Matale. This garden is famous for its rare spices and herbs. A tour of the gardens will show you the cultivation, harvesting, cleaning, and packaging process, as well as the health benefits and uses of the herbs.On the way, we saw a colourful Muthumariamman Hindu temple, boasting hundreds of detailed sculptures in a rich mosaic of colour.In Kandy, we visited the Temple of the Tooth Relic (Sri Dalada Maligawa), one of the most sacred places of worship in the Buddhist world. It was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1988.The temple sustained damage from bombings by Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna in 1989 and by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam in 1998. However, it was fully restored each time.We then headed to Jetwing St Andrew’s, a luxurious 5-star property in Sri Lanka’s hill country of Nuwara Eliya, situated at 1,900 metres above sea level. During our stay in Kandy, we immersed ourselves in the city's charm and the serenity of the countryside. On the third day, early morning, we travelled to Nuwara Eliya, the area famous for tea estates that give many Nepalis the feeling that they have come to Kanyam, Ilam, in eastern Nepal.We visited a tea factory called Damro Labookellie Tea Centre, the oldest tea centre in Sri Lanka. Due to its cold climate, it is the most important area for tea production in Sri Lanka.In this tea factory, they make white and black tea, while the green tea is processed in another tea factory and then sent to Damro.After the tea factory tour and the tea tasting, we headed to Galle, our next resting point.We encountered narrow, winding, and maze-like streets and alleys in Nuwara Eliya, known as ‘Little England’. The town has preserved almost all its British-era buildings and is calm and beautiful. On our way to Galle, at the roadside, our tour guide stopped us at the famed Sita temple, which has Hanuman's footprints and is the place where Sita, wife of Lord Rama, was held captive by the demon king Ravana after he abducted her from India.We were at Sita Eliya, a temple named Sri Seethai Amman.When we reached the Hindu temple, rich in vibrant colours and architectural elements, it was full of devotees. The water stream adjoining the temple is believed to be where Sita bathed. Large footprints are found on the stones in the stream, and there is a saying that those belong to Hanuman, who came spying to find Sita’s whereabouts.In Ella, Ravana’s waterfalls are significant in the Rama-Ravana story. The cascade charms visitors from all over the globe. The waterfall is easily accessible and is known to have hidden caves at the top, which are believed to have been used as Ravana's residence.The 25-metre-tall waterfall is a beautiful cascade that provides the perfect backdrop for a photo to remember your Ramayana trail adventures in Sri Lanka. A short pilgrimage tour ended there, and it was now time for an adventure. Though it was not part of our itinerary, our guide decided to tour us on a train ride.Though short, only six kilometres from Ella to Demodera, it was thrilling. Everyone screamed in unison like kids on a fair ride to hear the echoes in the dark every time we passed through the tunnels. The sound of the train is subtly different inside a tunnel. For the first-timer, the darkness and shouts inside the tunnels when the train passes would be scary, like a horror movie.The train we boarded wasn’t crowded, but people had already filled the doorway, ready for the scenic journey.With the shrill sound of a whistle, the train slowly pulled away from the platform at Ella, passing houses, coconut trees and green fields.As the train progressed, tourists and locals were leaning out the windows and crowding to hang out the doors. I joined the crowd and hung out on a train. A short excitement ended there.After lunch, we headed to Galle and reached Jetwing Lighthouse. As soon as our group entered the hotel, they shouted with excitement.The hotel is on a rocky outcrop three miles west of Galle. Waves crash over giant boulders in front of it and produce howling winds.We were at Galle’s 17th-century fort five minutes from the hotel on day four. In the Bay of Galle on the southwest coast of Sri Lanka, Galle Fort was built first in 1588 by the Portuguese and lavishly rebuilt by the Dutch during the 17th century. It is a historical, archaeological and architectural heritage monument that maintains a perfect appearance even after more than 436 years.We then reached Hikkaduwa Beach, a popular beach destination on the southern coast of Sri Lanka. On the way, we saw a 30-metre-high Big Buddha Statue. It is a replica of the 6th-century Buddhas of Bamiyan destroyed by the Taliban in Afghanistan. It was created using the earliest known sketches of the statue. It was built in remembrance of the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami victims.We then travelled through the 222-kilometre-long Southern Expressway, Sri Lanka's first expressway linking the capital, Colombo, with Galle, Matara, and Hambantota, significant cities south of the island.On day five, we reached Colombo, the capital of Sri Lanka. Jetwing Colombo Seven hosted us in the bustling capital. We took a city tour early morning and visited Bally's Casino at night.On day six, we returned to Kathmandu early in the morning on a Sri Lankan Airlines flight, the airline that organised the trip in coordination with Jetwing Hotels Limited, a Sri Lankan hotel chain.National flag carrier Nepal Airlines, in its previous avatar as Royal Nepal Airlines, used to operate direct flights to Colombo during the 1980s. However, the carrier suspended operations following an armed movement by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) in Sri Lanka. There had been no direct air links between the two countries for decades.In 2016, Himalaya Airlines started a chartered flight that lasted a few months due to low traffic movement between the two countries. Sri Lankan Airlines started operating direct flights to Kathmandu in August 2021.“The main objective of this media tour is to increase tourism in both countries for mutual benefit. We want to draw Nepalis for pilgrims and leisure activities,” says Nilina Pathirana, Country Manager at Srilankan Airlines in Nepal.“We have understood that Nepali travellers tend to travel to Bangkok, Vietnam, Malaysia, Dubai, and Maldives. Nepalis have quite minimal knowledge about Sri Lanka and the religious connection between Lanka and Nepal. We want to promote Nepal and Sri Lanka jointly. This will be a win-win business,” added Pathirana.The airline said it currently carries 60 percent of the passengers from Nepal to Sri Lanka and beyond destinations like Tokyo, Sydney, Melbourne, and other Middle Eastern destinations. The return airfare for a 3.5-hour-long flight starts at Rs74,000. “We have a four-night, five-day package that begins from Rs80,000, depending on the properties and extended itineraries,” says Pathirana.Nepalis must submit certain required documents for visa processing, like their passport copy and bank statement. Due to this government-to-government policy, only Nepalis must obtain a prior visa. Otherwise, Sri Lankans are required to have a visa upon arrival.“The other best thing is that Sri Lankan Airlines can be involved with the visa process or facilitate the Nepalis tourists. Our main intention is to have a sustainable market in Kathmandu and make it a daily flight,” says Pathirana. \nMundhum Trek in Koshi province in the eastern part of Nepal is a new cultural walking trail. It passes through several indigenous ethnic villages and landscapes in Khotang and Bhojpur districts. This trail goes up to an elevation of 4,200 metres to the viewpoint of Silchung Peak and takes one through the settlements of the Kirati people. This route starts from Diktel Bazaar and passes through beautiful settlements like Chakhewa, Rawa Dhap, Salpa Bhanjyang, Silchung and Hanspokhari before ending in Bhojpur. There are some hotels in Diktel but trekkers are advised to carry tents. The trail offers panoramic views of most of the eight-thousanders, including Everest, Lhotse, Makalu, Cho Oyu and Kanchenjunga mountains. The spring season, March through May, is highly recommended for the trek.Janaki Mandir Janaki Mandir at Janakpur in Madhesh province was constructed in 1874 and is a blend of Mughal and local architecture. The temple is a three-storey building and has 60 rooms, making it the largest temple in Nepal. Pilgrims flock here by the thousands to pay homage to Janaki Mandir—Janaki being the other name of Sita, the daughter of King Janak. The temple houses an idol of Sita which was found near Ayodhya, the kingdom of Ram. The marriage anniversary of Lord Ram and Sita is celebrated in Janakpur every year on Vivaha Panchami, which falls in December. In the southwest corner of Janaki Mandir is the Vivaha Mandap, which has been built at the site where the marriage of Ram and Sita is said to have taken place. Another well-known temple in the vicinity is Ram Mandir, which is built in pagoda style and is hence different from the other temples in Janakpur that generally bear resemblance to Mughal architecture. It houses a female statue, said to be of Yogamaya, which has the reputation of being one of the most beautiful images of female forms in Nepal. Other holy sites of interest include the Laxman Temple, Sankat Mochan Temple and Hanuman Temple.Kuri Village, Kalinchok Kuri village, a popular tourist destination around 150 km from Kathmandu, lies at an altitude of 3,842 metres above sea level in Kalinchowk of Dolakha district, in Bagmati province. People visit the place to enjoy the snow during the winter besides the mesmerising landscapes and splendid panoramic view of the Himalayan range. Kalinchok gets snow mainly at the end of December and the snowfall continues till the end of February or mid-March. When there is snow, it is difficult for jeeps, buses and cars to reach the top of Kuri village. Chains are wrapped around the wheels of vehicles and specially modified jeeps with highly experienced drivers are used to carry visitors. There are several hotels and restaurants in the area. The road up to Kuri has also improved over the years.Annapurna Base Camp Annapurna Base Camp trek, in Gandaki province, makes for a picturesque journey that takes you to the foothills of the Annapurna South, up to 4,130 metres above sea level. The five-day trek (seven days for slow walkers) offers rich cultural diversities, typical Nepali villages and the flora and fauna nestled at the foothills of Annapurna. The distance from Pokhara to Annapurna Base Camp is approximately 81 kilometres. It is among the shortest and most budget-friendly treks in Nepal. For Nepalis, lodging costs around $5 to $10 per day. For foreigners, the overall cost of the trek ranges from $800 to $1500 on average per person. Annapurna Base Camp trek can be done at any time throughout the year as each season offers a different trekking experience. The ideal time for the trek depends on your weather preferences and what you expect from it. However, autumn (September to October) and spring (March to May) are considered the two best seasons for the trek, as the days at the time are warm and bright with clear skies.Bardiya National Park Bardiya National Park, located in the southern Tarai belt of Lumbini province, is home to one of the most elusive and majestic animals on earth—the Royal Bengal Tiger. The park, which covers an area of 968 square kilometres, is considered one of the most important protected areas in the country. It is a prime destination for those looking to catch a glimpse of a tiger. A bit of luck and patience will offer a good chance to see the Bengal Tiger. The jungle safari also offers one the opportunity to spot Asian elephants and the greater one-horned rhinoceros. The rare Gangetic river dolphins are occasionally spotted on rafting trips along the Geruwa River, the eastern channel of the Karnali river. Besides, visitors can enjoy the homestays and explore local Tharu culture. The right time to visit the park is from mid-September to mid-December and mid-February to May.Khaptad National Park Khaptad National Park in Sudurpaschim province is a protected area in the far western region. It stretches over four districts of Bajhang, Bajura, Achham and Doti and ranges in elevation from 1,400 to 3,300 metres. The park can be visited throughout the year. Trekkers are advised to bring their tents, food and other supplies. The Nepal Tourism Board says of late, social media has been increasingly influencing Nepali travellers to go to Khaptad. Since the far-flung Khaptad National Park is still offbeat for many travellers, the area remains pristine and fresh. The seasons of spring (March-May) and autumn (October-November) are the ideal times to visit the park. The temperature ranges from 10°c to 20°c offering pleasant trekking weather. The monsoon begins in June and lasts until September and during this time, roads often become muddy and slippery. From December to February, winter brings snow and chilling winds to the park.Limi Valley \nOnce again, my heart swelled with joy when my hometown came into view.Arriving at Lalikharka after the treacherous journey through Pauwa Bhanjyang and the bustling Kanchhi Dokan, Phidim, the headquarters of Panchthar district, revealed itself like a surprise gift. My home town, Phidim, is unique in the fact that it reveals to travellers approaching it from uphill. As the vehicle descends the mountain road, it slowly comes into view, its houses and buildings recognisable for the native son.This Dashain, I undertook the much-awaited trip to my hometown with my wife Kabita and daughter Aarohi. Little did I anticipate the transformation that awaited me.The moment I got out of the jeep, I noticed that Phidim, nestled in the lush hills, has undergone a remarkable transformation over the years. As I guided my family to my home, which had suffered damages in the 1989 quake that struck eastern Nepal, I found that old, mud and stone houses had been replaced by concrete buildings. The place was vastly different from the one I remembered.Arriving at my childhood home felt like reuniting with an old friend. Navigating its nooks and crannies with my daughter, we delved into the history of the house, a symbol of my cherished memories.My wife had visited Phidim years ago, spending a month with my parents. She, too, recalled beautiful moments she had had in the town. I asked the tenant about the neighbours and acquaintances. Some had died, while others had left for good.A call to local journalist Giriraj Banskota led me to the school grounds, where memories flooded back. This was where I spent my teenage years, playing ball, learning to kick, and watching major tournaments. Here, I even encountered a group of Western climbers headed to Kanchenjunga, the world’s third-highest mountain. I remember being awed by their shiny yellow tents, headlights and strange smell. I remember practising my tutephuteko Angrezi with the climbers. Birendra Shield, an annual sports tournament named after the late king, brought ace players from various schools in Panchthar district. The district also hosted Yuba Mela, an annual three-day fair to commemorate the birthday of the king, organising football tournaments in which teams from as far as Sunsari and Taplejung participated. I never excelled at dribbling balls. A boy growing up in a seven-member family, I soon found my interest in literature. In the late 1980s, Phidim hosted a major literary festival. In the run-up to the 1990 pro-democracy protest, walls were painted with anti-monarchy slogans, local politicians were arrested. I took my family to my school, Naya Namuna Secondary School. It was Saturday, so the school was closed. I peeked through the steel gate and wall, imagining myself labouring over classes. Memories are hazy, but what I remember most is going out of the school—to quiz contests with me leading the school team, to essay competitions at the District Education Office and to play carom board, a national pastime, in a nearby shopfront. Returning to the main street, the demolition of a landmark gate made me reflect on how cities transform, shedding old landmarks for new identities. Navigating narrow alleyways, I felt like a stranger in my own hometown. Multistory buildings have emerged and roads have been paved, reshaping the town. It’s the same place with a different face, leaving me nostalgic for the Phidim of my memories.We finally reached Shivalaya temple, which I told my wife and daughter was one of my cherished hangouts. A giant statue of Falgunanda (the Kirant leader’s birthday is celebrated on November 10) stood before the steps to the temple. Though my wife suspected I came here to smoke, in reality, I visited the temple in the evening to meet friends and talk about issues that mattered most to us at the time. It also offered a panoramic view of the town (I could not take my family to Gadhi Danda, a hillock across the Shivalaya).Towards the end of my journey, I felt sad about Phidim’s lack of prospects. To my dismay, I found that people have been leaving the town in droves. Despite blacktopped roads and multi-story buildings, Phidim faces a troubling reality. The lack of quality higher education and specialist healthcare has driven people away, echoing the circumstances that led me to Kathmandu years ago. Conversations with locals confirmed a mass exodus from the town, a trend that raises concerns about Phidim's future.My conversations with familiar strangers led me to conclude that Phidim has transformed into a transit town for pilgrims heading to Pathibhara Devi Temple, which is around 255 kilometres north in Taplejung district. I met dozens of people headed to the holy site. While pilgrims see it as a stopover, for me, it was a homecoming. The realisation dawned that Phidim is, perhaps, in a state of transition, trading its rustic charm for the hallmarks of urbanisation. While I left Phidim for higher education in Kathmandu, people from rural areas have flocked to the town in search of better opportunities, bringing life and energy to the once quiet community.As we bid adieu to my hometown, I couldn’t help but reflect on the inevitability of leaving a place, no matter how enamoured one is with it. Passing Kanchhi Dokan, I pointed out Kanchnajungha and Kumbhakarna to my daughter—symbols of my childhood. Phidim, now a blend of nostalgia and change, remains etched in my heart, a testament to the intricate dance between memory and evolution. \nNewcastle United’s Anthony Gordon equalised 14 minutes from time to secure a 1-1 draw at Bournemouth in the Premier League on Sunday and spoil their hosts’ 125th anniversary celebrations.Marcus Tavernier put Bournemouth ahead in the first half but Gordon stole in at the back post to steer home a 76th-minute cross from substitute Harvey Barnes to ensure a deserved share of the spoils.Newcastle advanced to four points from their opening two games of the season. Bournemouth drew their first match at Nottingham Forest.Bournemouth, hoping for a win to mark their anniversary festivities, had the ball in the net in stoppage time for what looked initially to be a dramatic late winner but Dango Ouattara’s effort was ruled out for handball after a VAR check.Ouattara rose powerfully but a check showed the ball hit him on the top of his arm as he went up for the header and it was disallowed to the frustration of the home fans.It was Newcastle who looked more likely to snatch a winner, however, with Bournemouth goalkeeper Neto making several key stops to deny Alexander Isak, Joelinton and a header from centre-back Dan Burn in the closing stages.Bournemouth’s lead came after Antoine Semenyo had stolen possession from Joelinton and worked the ball past three defenders before setting up a tap-in for Tavernier.Joelinton was caught midway in his own half by the Bournemouth winger, who looked to have taken on too much as he stormed in at goal but managed to get a square pass to Tavernier when surrounded by three defenders.Semenyo, who struck the crossbar in the first half, was close to another assist in the 64th minute but his pass from the wing was miscued by a sliding Evanilson at the back post.Bournemouth’s record signing was making his debut in one of five changes from last week’s line-up but Evanilson’s two other efforts on goal were easily dealt with by home goalkeeper Nick Pope and he was taken off after 72 minutes.Madueke hits hat-trick as Chelsea thrash Wolves 6-2 Noni Madueke silenced the boos with a second-half hat-trick all assisted by Cole Palmer as Chelsea crushed Wolverhampton Wanderers 6-2 away in a frenetic Premier League clash at Molineux on Sunday.Chelsea’s first Premier League points of the season and the first for new manager Enzo Maresca arrived in spectacular fashion as the visitors ripped Wolves apart after the break following an absorbing first period.Maresca’s side led twice in the first half with goals by Nicolas Jackson and Palmer but both times Wolves deservedly hit back through Matheus Cunha and Jorgen Strand Larsen.Wolves fell apart after the break, however, and Madueke took the game beyond them with three goals in 15 minutes.Joao Felix came off the bench to mark his return to the club with his side’s sixth goal.Much has been made of Chelsea’s huge squad assembled at massive cost and the baffling puzzle Italian Maresca has been hired to solve, but the youthful side he sent out on Sunday including nine players aged 23 or under gelled impressively.Madueke was the villain for the home fans in more ways than one. The English forward was booed from the start after a deleted social media post in which he insulted the city of Wolverhampton.He silenced the hecklers in emphatic fashion, however, to get Chelsea’s league campaign up and running after their opening defeat by champions Manchester City.With Wolves in disarray, Pedro Neto, who left them for Chelsea in the summer, teed up Felix for a cool finish.Slot off to winning start at home as Liverpool cruise past Brentford Arne Slot’s comfortable start to life as Liverpool manager continued when his new side strolled to a 2-0 victory over Brentford in the Premier League on Sunday.Liverpool dominated early on, scoring a fine opening goal on the counterattack when Luis Diaz arrowed his first of the season into the top corner with 13 minutes on the clock.Brentford responded well, going close with two short-range headers either side of halftime, but Mohamed Salah ended the visitors’ hopes of taking anything from their trip to Anfield with a second goal 20 minutes from time.Dutchman Slot now has two 2-0 wins from two games as he undertakes the difficult task of replacing Juergen Klopp as Liverpool boss, with a testing trip to Manchester United up next.“The time with Juergen (was) amazing and the time with the new boss is a joy and he has a certain way of playing,” Liverpool captain Virgil van Dijk told Sky Sports.Before Sunday, no Liverpool boss since Graeme Souness in 1991 had secured wins in their two opening league games in charge.Brentford, without star striker Ivan Toney in the squad again as speculation over his future continues, grew into the contest, but could not make a sustained spell of pressure before halftime count.Liverpool upped the ante after the break and deservedly got their second goal, with Salah adding to his strike on the opening day at Ipswich Town with another well-taken shot to seal the victory.Salah is now Liverpool’s outright fifth top scorer at Anfield in all competitions with 118 goals, moving ahead of Robbie Fowler as he again looks primed to be front and centre of a Red title tilt. \nNepal stormed into the final of the SAFF U-20 Championship after they defeated ten-man Bhutan 4-1 on penalties following a 1-1 draw at the ANFA Complex in Lalitpur on Sunday.Nepal goalkeeper Jiyarat Shekh was the hero of the shootout. He stopped penalties from Jigme Namgyel and Ugyen Dorji and scored the decisive penalty kick, sending Nepal into their third final of the competition.Nepal will face defending champions India or Bangladesh, who meet in the second semi-final clash on Monday, in the title match on Wednesday.The defeat also ended Bhutan’s hopes of reaching their first ever final of the SAFF age-group competition. They reached the semi-finals in 2017, 2019 and 2023.Bhutan were a better side and kept Nepal under pressure most of the first half but could not create any clear chance at goal.Nepal were also lacklustre before the break and could not really threaten the Bhutan post.But the game suddenly burst into life eleven minutes into the second half, when Jetsuen Dorji intercepted a poor pass from Semanta Thapa and launched a thunderstrike from outside the edge of the penalty area. Nepal goalie Shekh was completely aware of the incoming shot and could have done better but let the ball slip with his misguided effort.Nepal immediately felt a sense of urgency after conceding and their constant pressure on the opponents was rewarded with two freekicks from dangerous range after 70 minutes.Abinash Syangtan failed to convert both freekicks but his first attempt was a further warning of what Nepal could do as Bhutan’s goalkeeper Lhocho Nima had to work really hard to keep the shot away.Nepal continued to apply pressure and it earned them their first reward as Kinzang Tenzin was sent off for a second yellow after harshly challenging Sabin Ghimire in the middle of the pitch.Tenzin’s departure proved costly for Bhutan as Nepal equalised only six seconds after the match resumed.Semanta tossed the resulting freekick for Lachhu Thapa, who sent a long ball into the six yard box for Dhami to head home with an incredible back-header.Samir Tamang almost put the game to bed in the 90th minute but his header off a long pass from Ram Thapa missed the goal by inches.Bhutan had a golden opportunity to shock Nepal in the fifth minute of injury time when Semanta’s poor attempt to clear the ball fell straight to the path of Namgyel. But the midfielder could not capitalise on the chance from near the spot kick, as the game went to tiebreaker. \nNepal Volleyball Association on Saturday awarded cash prizes to the four volleyball teams who won medals at various Central Asian Volleyball Association (CAVA) tournaments.The association honoured the team members of gold and silver medallists of CAVA Beach Volleyball, silver medallists of CAVA Women’s Volleyball Nations League and bronze medallists of CAVA U-20 Women’s Volleyball Championship amid a function in Kathmandu.The players of the national women’s volleyball team who won silver medal at the CAVA Women’s Volleyball Nations League in Kathmandu earlier this month were rewarded with Rs102,000 each. Captain Aruna Shahi’s team had also made history by defeating India for the first time in their volleyball history during the group stage of the tournament. However, their hopes to win a first major trophy at home remained unfulfilled after they lost to the Indians in the final. Women’s volleyball head coach Jagadhish Bhatta also bagged Rs102,000, while assistant coach Bharat Yadav received Rs92,000. Physio Lokendra Kunwar and manager Nilam Bajracharya got Rs82,000 each.Kamala Pun and Manisha Chaudhary were provided with Rs60,000 each for winning the gold medal at the CAVA Beach Volleyball in Bhutan.Man Bahadur Shrestha and Dil Bahadur Sunar’s pair, who won silver in beach volleyball in Bhutan, were honoured with Rs30,000 each.

His unbeaten 67 (84) had guided Nepal to a seven-wicket victory against the United Arab Emirates in the Premier Cup final. Jha was also an important part of the Nepal squad at ICC U-19 World Cup and T20 World Cup. Footballer Rai has established herself as one of the most important players of the national women’s football team. Her stoppage time goal against Lebanon guided Nepal to the final of the WAFF Women’s Championship last year.Manmati Bista was a part of the Nepal national women’s kabaddi team who won a bronze medal at the 19th Asian Games in Hangzhou, China.Volleyball player Bhatta is a regular at the national team. She was in the squad that secured a silver medal at the CAVA Women’s Volleyball Nations League this month.Rugby’s Shrestha led Bagmati Province to the championship during the National Games. He also represented Nepal in the rugby competition at the 19th Asian Games. \nHezbollah launched hundreds of rockets and drones at Israel early on Sunday, as Israel’s military said it struck Lebanon with around 100 jets to thwart a larger attack, in one of the biggest clashes in more than 10 months of border warfare.Missiles were visible curling up through the dawn sky, dark vapour trails behind them, as an air raid siren sounded in Israel and a distant blast lit the horizon, while smoke rose over houses in Khiam in southern Lebanon.On Sunday evening, sirens sounded in Rishon Letsiyon, central Israel, the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) said, and added that one projectile had been identified crossing from the southern Gaza Strip and falling in an open area. The armed wing of Hamas said it had fired an “M90” rocket at Tel Aviv.Any major spillover in the fighting, which began in parallel with the war in Gaza, risks morphing into a regional conflagration drawing in Hezbollah’s backer Iran and Israel’s main ally, the United States.With three deaths confirmed in Lebanon and one in Israel, both sides indicated they were happy to avoid further escalation for now, but warned that there could be more strikes to come.Hezbollah leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah said the Iranian-backed group’s barrage, a reprisal for the assassination of senior commander Fuad Shukr last month, had been completed “as planned”.However, the group would assess the impact of its strikes and “if the result is not enough, then we retain the right to respond another time”, he said.Israel’s foreign minister said the country did not seek a full-scale war, but Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu warned: “This is not the end of the story.”Earlier, Netanyahu had said: “We are determined to do everything we can to defend our country ... whoever harms us - we harm him”.The two sides have exchanged messages that neither wants to escalate further, with the main gist being that the exchange was “done”, two diplomats told Reuters.Expectations of an escalation had risen since a missile strike in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights last month killed 12 youths and the Israeli military assassinated Shukr in Beirut in response.Hezbollah had delayed its retaliation to give time for ceasefire talks, and had calibrated its attack to avoid triggering a full-scale war, a Hezbollah official said.US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin ordered the presence of two aircraft carrier strike groups in the Middle East, bolstering the US military presence. Earlier, top US General C.Q. Brown arrived in Israel for talks with military leaders.Meanwhile in Gaza, the Israeli offensive continued, with air strikes killing at least five Palestinians in Gaza City early on Monday, according to the official Palestinian news agency Wafa.There was no agreement in the Gaza ceasefire talks that took place in Cairo, with neither Hamas nor Israel agreeing to several compromises presented by mediators, although a senior US official, described the talks as “constructive” and said the process would continue in the coming days.DENSE BOMBARDMENTIsrael’s air strikes started before Hezbollah began its barrage, Nasrallah said. Netanyahu said these “pre-emptive” strikes had foiled a much larger Hezbollah barrage but Nasrallah said they had had little impact.Hezbollah’s own rocket and drone strikes were focused on an intelligence base near Tel Aviv, Nasrallah said. Netanyahu said all the drones targeting what he called a strategic location in central Israel were intercepted.A security source in Lebanon said at least 40 Israeli strikes had hit various towns in the country’s south in one of the densest bombardments since hostilities began in October.Hezbollah said the strikes killed two of its fighters in al-Tiri. The Hezbollah-allied Shi’ite Muslim group Amal said a strike on Khiam killed one of its fighters.Israel’s military said a naval soldier was killed and two wounded.Lebanon’s caretaker prime minister, Najib Mikati, met cabinet ministers at a session of the national emergency committee.Flights to and from Ben Gurion airport in Tel Aviv were suspended for around 90 minutes. Some flights to and from Beirut were also halted, stranding passengers.WARNING SIRENSIn northern Israel, warning sirens sounded and explosions were heard in several areas as Israel’s Iron Dome aerial defence system shot down rockets coming from southern Lebanon.“Israel should, as it did this morning, deliver a pre-emptive strike. But if Hezbollah continues, Israel should strike very hard to remove the threat from Hezbollah once and for all,” said Yuval Peleg, 73, from Haifa.A resident of the southern Lebanese town of Zibqeen told Reuters he had awakened “to the sound of planes and the loud explosions of rockets - even before the dawn prayer. It felt like the apocalypse.”The White House said US President Joe Biden was following events. “We will keep supporting Israel’s right to defend itself, and we will keep working for regional stability,” National Security Council spokesperson Sean Savett said.United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres was “deeply concerned” by the escalation between Israel and Hezbollah and called on both parties to immediately return to a cessation of hostilities, his spokesperson said.Egypt and Jordan also warned against escalation.The United States was not involved in Israel’s strikes on Sunday, but provided some intelligence about incoming Hezbollah attacks, a US official said.Hezbollah fired missiles at Israel immediately after the Oct. 7 attacks by Hamas gunmen on Israel. Hezbollah and Israel have been exchanging fire constantly ever since, while avoiding a major escalation as war rages in Gaza to the south.That precarious balance appeared to shift after the strike in the Golan Heights, for which Hezbollah denied responsibility, and the subsequent assassination of Shukr, one of Hezbollah’s most senior military commanders.Shukr’s death in an air strike was quickly followed by the assassination of Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran, which led to vows of reprisals against Israel by Iran. \nThirteen people were killed and two injured in Indonesia's North Maluku province on Sunday after floods in the east of the sprawling archipelago, authorities said.The country's disaster management agency BNPB said the floods, caused by heavy rain since Saturday, also badly damaged 10 houses in Ternate city.Citing forecasts that heavy rain may continue in the next few days, BNPB warned residents to be on guard.\"We urge people to remain vigilant and follow directions from authorities on potential subsequent floods,\" spokesperson Abdul Muhari said in a statement.BNPB said it has deployed a team to help evacuate the victims. Search and rescue agency Basarnas also said that efforts to evacuate victims, who were hit by landslides and debris swept along by floodwaters, were ongoing.In May, flash floods and mudslides in Indonesia's West Sumatra province killed more than 60 people. \nPavel Durov, the Russian-French billionaire founder and CEO of the Telegram messaging app, was arrested at Bourget airport outside Paris on Saturday evening, TF1 TV and BFM TV said, citing unidentified sources.Durov was travelling aboard his private jet, TF1 said on its website, adding he had been targeted by an arrest warrant in France as part of a preliminary police investigation.TF1 and BFM both said the investigation was focused on a lack of moderators on Telegram, and that police considered that this situation allowed criminal activity to go on undeterred on the messaging app.Durov faces possible indictment on Sunday, according to French media.The encrypted Telegram, with close to one billion users, is particularly influential in Russia, Ukraine and the republics of the former Soviet Union. It is ranked as one of the major social media platforms after Facebook, YouTube, WhatsApp, Instagram, TikTok and Wechat.Telegram did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment. The French Interior Ministry and police had no comment.Russian-born Durov founded Telegram with his brother in 2013. He left Russia in 2014 after refusing to comply with government demands to shut down opposition communities on his VKontakte social media platform, which he sold.\"I would rather be free than to take orders from anyone,\" Durov told U.S. journalist Tucker Carlson in April about his exit from Russia and search for a home for his company which included stints in Berlin, London, Singapore and San Francisco.After Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Telegram has become the main source of unfiltered - and sometimes graphic and misleading - content from both sides about the war and the politics surrounding the conflict.The platform has become what some analysts call ‘a virtual battlefield’ for the war, used heavily by Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskiy and his officials, as well as the Russian government.Telegram – which allows users to evade official scrutiny - has also become one of the few places where Russians can access independent news about the war after the Kremlin increased curbs on independent media following its invasion of Ukraine.The Russian foreign ministry said its embassy in Paris was clarifying the situation around Durov and called on Western non-governmental organisations to demand his release.Russia began blocking Telegram in 2018 after the app refused to comply with a court order to grant state security services access to its users’ encrypted messages.The action interrupted many third-party services, but had little effect on the availability of Telegram there. The ban order, however, sparked mass protests in Moscow and criticism from NGOs.‘Neutral platform’TF1 said Dubai-based Durov had been travelling from Azerbaijan and was arrested at around 8 p.m. (1800 GMT).Durov, whose fortune was estimated by Forbes at $15.5 billion, said some governments had sought to pressure him but the app should remain a \"neutral platform\" and not a \"player in geopolitics\".Telegram’s increasing popularity, however, has prompted scrutiny from several countries in Europe, including France, on security and data breach concerns.Russia’s representative to international organisations in Vienna, Mikhail Ulyanov, and several other Russian politicians were quick on Sunday to accuse France of acting as a dictatorship - the same criticism that Moscow faced when putting demands on Durov in 2014 and trying to ban Telegram in 2018.\"Some naive persons still don’t understand that if they play more or less visible role in international information space it is not safe for them to visit countries which move towards much more totalitarian societies,\" Ulyanov wrote on X.Elon Musk, billionaire owner of X, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter, said after reports of Durov’s detention: \"It’s 2030 in Europe and you’re being executed for liking a meme.\"Robert F. Kennedy Jr, who on Friday abandoned his U.S. presidential campaign and endorsed Republican Donald Trump, said on X after the reports that the need to protect free speech, \"has never been more urgent.\"Several Russian bloggers called for protests at French embassies throughout the world at noon on Sunday. \nIn 2008 Matina Shakya was only three years old when she was appointed as the Kumari of Kathmandu. She was succeeded by Trishna Shakya as the new Kumari in 2017.Kumaris are revered as goddesses of beauty and strength in certain Hindu and Buddhist traditions. Worshipping young girls as Kumaris is a 2,000-year-old practice in Nepal. Since the 13th century, when the Malla kings ruled, the Newars of the Kathmandu Valley have been worshipping Kumari, a girl from the Shakya/Bajracharya community chosen to embody the divine energy of goddess Taleju Bhawani. The reign of a Kumari ends when she starts menstruating. So long as she is serving as the Kumari, she is believed to be the nation’s divine protector, safeguarding it from evil. Matina, 18, is now in her first year of college, studying for a bachelor’s degree in management. Her father, Pratapman Shakya, when asked about having a daughter who is the only living the goddess in the world said, “Not having your own daughter live in the same house as you seemed a little unfair, but we feel very proud to call ourselves the parents of the royal Kumari who is revered by people all over the world.”On March 9, 2023, he, along with Matina, were getting ready for a special function held to honour all former Kumaris from across Nepal. “There are often events to honour Matina as she was the royal Kumari, but this one was dedicated to all former Kumaris from different areas. There are 129 living Kumaris in all,” he added. Besides Kathmandu, Kumari tradition is followed in Bhaktapur, Lalitpur, and Kirtipur, among other cities.According to him, this was the first time an event like this was organised and the Deputy Mayor of Kathmandu, Sunita Dangol, was also in attendance.Throughout the year, many people line up outside the ‘Kumari Ghar’ to get a chance to visit the Kumari and get her blessings. Many foreigners stand out in the yard to catch a glimpse of her. Nepali people believe that if a Kumari smiles at you, it is a bad omen.Everyday, a tutor visits the Kumari to help her continue with her education as she is not allowed to step outside the Kumari Ghar. She takes her exams and does her homework from the Kumari Ghar itself. She also has the freedom to play inside the Kumari Ghar. Many former kumaris have pursued careers in their fields of interest or studied after their term ends, and they continue to be treated with the same respect. The tradition of Kumari has evolved over time. In the past Kumaris did not enjoy these freedoms.Because of various superstitious beliefs, Kumaris were not fully educated and were forbidden from getting married because of the belief that the groom would die soon if he married an ex-Kumari. They led secluded lives, were restricted from participating in normal childhood activities, and focused solely on their religious duties.However, now, these myths have been dispelled. Modern understanding has shifted to recognise that Kumaris, after stepping down from their divine role, have the freedom to marry and lead a normal life. The perception of Kumaris as isolated figures has evolved, with a focus on providing them with a more balanced upbringing. There have been initiatives to integrate Kumaris into regular social and educational settings, allowing them to have a more holistic and fulfilling childhood experience. “Matina was already familiar with the students from the school that she attended after her term as Kumari ended,” said Shakya. “The kids visited the Kumari Ghar frequently so that she could have a smooth transition,” he added. According to Gautam Prasad Shakya, who has been living as a caretaker in the Kumari Ghar, the changes made to the tradition are minor. “The traditions of Kumari have mostly stayed the same. All the rituals are still practised like in the old days,” he said.On 6 May 2005, Pun Devi Maharjan, a lawyer, filed a case in the Supreme Court claiming that the traditional practice of electing young girls as Kumaris, or “goddesses’, who are expected to follow certain social restrictions and appear at religious festivals, violated the rights of the child. Quoting Maharjan’s complaint, Puskar Mathema writes in Yuwamanch Monthly of October 2007, “If Kumari tradition is continued, it will undermine the fundamental rights as well the freedoms of children guaranteed by the constitution and child rights treaties. Apart from this, it will have a negative impact on their physical and mental development.”The case continued while Nepal overthrew the monarchy and declared itself a secular state in 2007. When the judgement was pronounced in 2008, the goddess was still in her role, now giving blessings to the country’s President. The court ordered that the Kumaris and ex-Kumaris receive better benefits and arrangements and ordered the government to improve their support and allowances.In April 2006, Prof Chunda Bajracharya filed a petition at the Supreme Court against Maharjan’s petition, who had argued against the Kumari tradition. Bajracharya contended that the tradition should be preserved as heritage due to its over 100 years of history.“People who don’t understand the culture shouldn’t comment on it,” she stated. Bajracharya also criticised the human right activists who contended that Kumaris were only allowed to wear the colour red. “People who say Kumaris are forced to wear red clothing all the time, are the same people who send their kids to schools in uniform,” she said.“After the 2008 court verdict, there have been a lot of improvements. Now, a teacher visits the Kumari Ghar daily to tutor the Kumari, who is expected to complete school assignments and sit periodic exams. All the former Kumaris now get benefits like scholarships and special pensions,” she added.Bajracharya is currently a professor of literature at the Tribhuvan University in Kathmandu.“The only significant change that the court verdict brought to the tradition was in terms of her education,” said Gautam Prasad Shakya, the caretaker. “Kumaris were tutored long before the case, but the case helped formalise this arrangement. After the court verdict, the time between 12 pm and 4 pm was designated as the Kumari’s tuition time,” he added.After the verdict, there was a concerted effort to provide Kumaris with access to quality education, enabling them to develop the skills and knowledge needed to lead fulfilling lives beyond their divine roles. There was also a shift towards ensuring that the Kumari's living quarters are comfortable, safe, and conducive to her overall well-being.Moreover, the selection process for the Kumari underwent reforms in the aftermath of the Pun Devi Maharjan case. There was a push for greater transparency, accountability, and inclusivity in the selection of the Kumari, with an emphasis on ensuring that the process was fair, respectful, and free from undue influence.Efforts were made to support their transition into adulthood, including providing them with comprehensive resources for education, vocation, and social integration. This shift aimed to address the challenges faced by former Kumaris and empower them to lead independent and fulfilling lives after their divine service.“The Kumari tradition has evolved over time. During the tenure of my daughter, we saw a lot of improvements. Even after her time as Kumari, Matina continued to get a lot of government support,” said Shakya, former Kumari Matina’s father.“Some people argue that child rights are being violated, but all of her rights are being upheld inside the Kumari Ghar. This is a unique and respected aspect of Nepali culture, and I don’t believe it violates any of my child’s rights.”While the Kumari tradition continues, its practices have evolved. “She enjoys this normal life and it didn’t take her long to adjust as well,” says Matina’s father, on her transition from the revered Kumari to the ordinary Matina. \nWhat animals did Juddha Shumsher have in his zoo?“We only have records of animals from the mid-1960s,” says Ganesh Koirala, who has been employed at the Central Zoo for the past 36 years and currently serves as its information officer and programme officer. “That too I hand-copied from an old torn-down file that I came across.”Today, the Central Zoo, which sprawls across six hectares in Jawalakhel, Lalitpur, houses as many as 1,298 wild animals of different species of mammals, reptiles, fishes and birds from Nepal and around the world—from tiger, rhinoceros, hippopotamus and red panda to its recent attraction: a pair of chimpanzees.After enduring decades of neglect under various government bodies, with its animals and infrastructure scraping along in a deplorable state, the zoo received a new lease of life with improved infrastructure and animal care in 1995, when it came under the management of the King Mahendra Trust for Nature Conservation (KMTNC), now known as the National Trust for Nature Conservation, in 1995.Today, the Central Zoo is an entertainment venue, one of the most happening places in the Kathmandu valley. Flocked by thousands of daily visitors, the zoo now also hosts rescued animals and those in need of rehabilitation. It is also a site for conservation education.But when Juddha Shumsher Rana (prime minister from 1932–1945) built the Jawalakhel Zoological Garden on the premises of his Jawalakhel Durbar (where Nepal Administrative Staff College stands today) in 1932, he did so purely for private interests—as a space of entertainment and amusement for him and his family.Built in the semi-wilderness of Jawalakhel around a historical pond dating to the 17th century during the reign of King Siddhi Narsingh Malla, the zoo also became the space he could use to show his respect for two women he revered, his mother and sister-in-law, and indulge in one of his favourite pastimes—gambling.Today, the Central Zoo, nestled in the heart of Jawalakhel's sprawling crowd, does not go unnoticed, and its story is well told. But what passions drove Juddha to build the zoo? What was its original layout? What animals did it have in the beginning? And how did Juddha spend time there?“I remember once seeing a small board that read ‘Jawalakhel Zoological Garden’,” Koirala says. “I don’t know whether it was from Juddha’s time or was made in the later years. It must surely be that Juddha built the zoo out of influence from the British given how this term was used by them.”Koirala adds, “There is a former employee, now an elderly gentleman who worked in the zoo in the 1960s. He surely has some stories from Juddha’s time.”Birds, beasts and palacesTo trace the birth of Jawalakhel Zoological Garden, one has to look at the history of Nepal’s rulers owning birds and animals.Like rulers around the world, Nepal’s royalty kept wild and exotic birds and animals in captivity as a source of pleasure and mark of wealth and power. The book ‘Social History of Nepal’ by historians TR Vaidya, Tri Ratna Manandhar and Shankar Lal Joshi details how Mallas during the mediaeval Kathmandu Valley to Ranas and Shahs in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries owned rare, exotic creatures. In 1708, a rhinoceros in Kathmandu Valley broke the iron chain in which it was bound and killed its tamer. In 1714, Bhaktapur’s King Bhupatindra Malla gifted a camel and an elephant to Kantipur’s King Bhaskar Malla to build peace.Among Shahs, King Rana Bahadur Shah in particular was reputed for his collection of birds and animals. He also owned a zoo outside his palace in Basantapur Durbar Square, where the Nepal Bank Limited stands in New Road today. The zoo contained “tiger, bear, monkey, elephant, horse, deer… heron, peacock… pigeon, wild dogs, rabbits, rats, mongoose.”Jung Bahadur Rana’s zoo on the premises of his Thapathali Durbar hosted a variety of birds and animals collected during his hunting expeditions as well as those brought from abroad. Jung Bahadur himself used to “supervise and inspect it”. Juddha Shumsher likewise had his own collection of creatures which steadily expanded into a zoological garden. Seeking wilderness in his Jawalakhel DurbarJuddha’s biographer Ishwari Prasad writes in ‘The Life and Times of Maharaja Juddha Shumsher Jung Bahadur Rana’ that between 1933 and 1940, Juddha shot 433 tigers, 33 rhinoceros and 93 leopards. An insatiable big-game hunter, Juddha had a deep fondness for being in the wild and among wild animals, and from this came, according to oral history prevalent among members of Kathmandu’s Rana community including Juddha’s descendants, the desire to own a zoo.Built in 1752, Schönbrunn Zoo in Vienna, the world’s first modern zoo, was already over 100 years old when Juddha was born in 1875. London Zoo opened in 1828 and Alipore Zoological Garden (Kolkata Zoo) in 1875. Nawab Wajid Ali Shah Zoological Garden (Lucknow Zoo) was established in 1921. Juddha’s inspiration, his descendants say, was most likely reinforced by his tours to zoological gardens during his visits to England in 1908 and to different Indian cities.An article titled ‘Central zoo in state of neglect’ published in The Kathmandu Post in 1996 says that Juddha one day “received a pair of leopards as a gift”, cementing his desire to own a zoo. A report ‘Central Zoo Master Plan’ prepared by the KMTNC in 1996 says that Juddha decided to build a zoo in an epiphany when he saw that some animals “including deer, a few rhinos, and some tigers had been collected from the Tarai and kept in Kathmandu” could be put into one compound in the “lonely piece of land with a large 16th [sic] century Malla period Pokhari”.The pond lay still and serene surrounded by green wilderness ever since Patan’s King Siddhi Narsingh Malla built it in the 1600s. On the grounds surrounding this pond, the Newars from Na:Tole, Pulchowk and surroundings had their devisthans where, for centuries, they gathered to perform their religious ceremonies during Basanta Panchami and Bhoto Jatra even after this area fell within the Jawalakhel Durbar.For the palace, the ground served as its extended garden along with a horse and elephant stable. Subodh Rana, 69, grandson of Juddha Shumsher, recalled his father Kiran Shumsher telling him that Juddha and his family sometimes also used the scenic grounds for picnics. If there was any spot where Juddha wanted to build a menagerie, it would be around this Pokhari (pond). One day, he called his grandson General Maheshwar Shumsher Rana and deputed him to the task of doing just this.The zoo’s layout—except for the small plots of lands acquired later—that was in place when it came under KMTNC's management was, the present and retired zoo officials believe, mostly the same as it was built by Maheshwar and so offers a peek into how Juddha’s zoo must have been like. Pond in the middle of the ground surrounded by enclosures—the southern bank housing mainly larger animals, and cages for birds positioned on the northern banks.From pigeons to the king of the jungleWhat animals and birds did the enclosures at Juddha’s zoo house?“We cannot tell for sure,” Koirala says.Once it came under government ownership, the zoo was tossed from one institution to the other for lack of interest and knowledge on the right institution to manage it. Amid all this chaos, documents were possibly lost and the zoo has no concrete record about the animals that Juddha must have once taken amusement at, said Koirala.Mukti Narayan Shrestha, 82, a retired secretary of the Nepal government, joined the Central Zoo in 1970 as a veterinarian when many original structures of the zoo were still intact. Shrestha also worked with an elderly khardar who, he says, was employed in the zoo since the time of Juddha and was about to retire when he joined.“In those days where the purpose of menageries was exclusively for exhibition and pleasure with no regard for the welfare and recreation of animals and birds, the cages were tiny and iron-barred,” Shrestha says.Elephant, horses, deer, monkeys, tiger, rhinoceros, clouded leopard, red panda, bear, palm civet (nir biralo), four-horned antelope, Himalayan goral, pheasants, Himalayan monal—from the mythical and the majestic, the gentle and friendly to the fiery and ferocious, Juddha’s zoo boasted them all, Shrestha says.Shrestha’s account is not different from the anecdotes passed down to other retired and present zoo officials and the members of the Rana community, who also detail the rare and the exotic fauna, like the gharial crocodile and porcupine, even the jungle’s king—creatures, they say, that Juddha must have received from foreigners as gifts—appearing alongside domestic birds like pigeons.Tidbits of published information also confirm that the zoo had a good collection of exotic birds and animals from Nepal and abroad. One such suggestion comes from Kalyan Shumsher’s ‘Shree Teen Juddha Mahima’ published during Juddha’s reign in 1943.“One need not travel abroad to see the incredible birds and animals found in foreign countries,” he writes. “It will suffice to see [those creatures] right here in the zoo opened by His Holiness Shree 3 [Juddha] in Jawalakhel.”Among these incredible creatures, one reigned supreme—lion, the king of the jungle.For one, it would not have satiated Juddha to build a zoo and not have the jungle’s king exhibited in it. Juddha hence must have done everything possible to ensure one for the zoo. Infrastructure at the zoo suggests that the lion indeed lived at Juddha’s zoo or, in the least, during the Rana regime.“Where bear habitat lies today, there were two dome-shaped attached enclosures with a holding room, constructed in the classic architecture that many enclosures in the British zoos had in the past. They had brick walls and lime plaster,” Koirala says. “These were built to house a lion in one cage and a tiger in the other.”Near these enclosures stood another cage that remains intact today, with the head of a roaring lion carved out of the wall on the top of its iron bars. Zoo officials as well as members of the Rana community believe that Juddha had this exhibit built to specifically house a lion.Remarkably, these Juddha-era infrastructural spaces are corroborated by a rare piece of photographic evidence. A 1946 photo of the zoo shows a lion while a Kathmandu mother and her sons stand in front of its cage.Juddha’s place of piety and playThe zoo was not merely a space that Juddha sought out for amusement and retreat in the outpost of his palace; he also used this place to express his deepest affection.This affection spills right at the zoo’s entrance, in the form of the life-size statue of Karma Kumari Devi, wife of Juddha’s elder brother and Rana Prime Minister Dev Shumsher. Karma Kumari stands tall in her regal costume shaded by a wide canopy. Juddha revered Karma Kumari because it was she who raised him and looked after his mother Juhar Kumari Devi after the death of his father Dhir Shumsher. On another prominent part of the zoo on the south-east, Juhar Kumari’s enthroned statue overlooks the pond. Juddha had commissioned the London-based sculptor Domenico Antonio Tonelli to cast these statues.When Karma Kumari’s statue was unveiled is not clear, but Juhar Kumari’s statue was unveiled by Juddha amid a grand function in 1935 on Jawalakhel’s most auspicious day, Bhoto Jatra. It was attended by the British Resident Frederick Bailey.“On June 28, 1935, at Jawalakhel Durbar… the pond nearby looked very scenic,” says a Gorkhapatra news report titled ‘Statue installation’ dated July 5, 1935. “Because it was the day of Bhoto Jatra of Machhindranath… and moreover since an ideal woman’s statue was being unveiled, there was a crowd of lakhs of people.”Less than fifty metres from Karma Kumari’s statue stands a one-story building with a pagoda roof that today serves as the zoo’s meeting hall. Juddha, an avid gambler, found the scenic semi-wilderness covered in trees and filled with the sounds of wildlife to be a perfect place to relish the game. So he built a building with twelve doors on its four sides allowing him and his fellow gambling compatriots the freedom to enter through a particular door that they thought would bring luck. He called it his Juwa Ghar, the gambling house, and built it with the sole purpose of indulging in the game he loved. Roar of lion reverberates in KathmanduThe sounds of the animals and birds in the zoo rose up in the Jawalakhel sky. Every day, until much later in the 1970s, roar of the zoo’s lion (there were later other lions) diffused to far corners of the Valley, merging the zoo with the spirit of Kathmandu and informing the city folks of its presence.But was the zoo open to the public as well?“I think once it was built, the zoo was open for the public,” Subodh Rana said. “It is unlikely that Juddha Shumsher built such a large zoo and kept it only for his family.”For one, Kalyan Shumsher mentioning that one “need not travel abroad to see the incredible birds and animals found in foreign countries” suggests that the public had at least some access to the zoo. Of course, the Newar community from Na:Tole, Pulchowk and surrounding areas were permitted inside the zoo on the days of their guthi functions on Basanta Panchami and Bhoto Jatra.As the zoo was established at the back of the ground where Bhoto Jatra celebrations happen, it naturally filled with revellers on this day in addition to the guthi ritual observers as testified by the Gorkhapatra report. The photo of the mother and her sons also bear testimony that the zoo was not entirely closed to the public.What is widely believed, though, is that the zoo officially came under government ownership after Nepal became a democracy in 1951. And it would still be a few more years before it was open to the public in 1956.In 1945, Juddha gave up his power and eventually retired in Dehradun, India, where he died in 1952. With time, Jawalakhel Zoological Garden became the Central Zoo. It would take many avatars—a neglected site of crammed, unmaintained cages with sad eyes of emaciated creatures staring from behind the bars, a focal point of animal diplomacy, particularly during the period of monarchy, to, in its recent decades, a space of conservation and education.When all this was happening, the city sprawled around Jawalakhel, subduing the lion’s roar with its noise. More wildlife from around the country and the world came—creatures captured from the wild, those sold by circuses, those rescued from traffickers. Fate would bring these creatures to the care of generations of Kathmandu folks, intertwining each other’s joys and sorrows. After the tale of Juddha’s Jawalakhel Zoological Garden, there would be these stories to tell. Sitting around a table inside Juddha’s Juwa Ghar, Koirala and other zoo officials begin unfolding these stories before me. \nNepal’s book market is no stranger to the popular Bangladeshi-Swedish writer Taslima Nasrin. Almost all of her books have been translated into Nepali, but Nasrin herself says that they are all unauthorised translations. “All books [Nepali translations] are pirated versions,” Nasrin told the Post in a Whatsapp conversation. Nasrin, who is currently in exile in India after facing death threats in Bangladesh following the publication of her novel Lajja (Shame), said that she or her publishers have never allowed anyone the right to translate her books into Nepali. “I don’t know of any such Nepali publishers. No one asked for permission and no one has paid [me] royalty.”Translating and publishing books without permission from authors or publishers is a punishable crime. But Nepal’s book market is full of such unauthorised translations and prints of books written by the who’s who of the world literature. Such endeavours haven’t just hurt the authors but also the readers, says Ajit Baral, publisher of the Kathmandu-based Fineprint publication. “These translations are poor,” Baral says. “Tomes with 1200–1300 pages have been trimmed to 200–300 pages. An example is the biography of Bill Clinton.”Another popular book that has seen unauthorised Nepali translation is the biography of Steve Jobs by Walter Isaacson.“We have no official deal in place for a [Nepali] translation of Steve Jobs,” Peppa Mignone, associate agent of the CAA, the translation authority of the biography, said in an email interview with the Post.The book’s Nepali translation is published by Panchpokhari Publication House. The translated book identifies the translator thus: “Achyut Koirala, who has a master’s in English literature, is primarily a journalist. He is currently affiliated with Nagarik daily. He keeps a close tab on international history, politics and culture and has written scripts and dialogues for half a dozen Nepali films. He has published over a dozen non-fiction books.”Koirala, who admits to the unauthorised translation, claims that he hasn’t just translated the book but has also done ‘creative writing’ with it.‘Rich Dad Poor Dad’, written by Robert Kiyosaki and Sharon Lechter, is among the books that’s perennially on the bestseller list across the world. Upon investigation, the Post found three Nepali translations of the book—all unauthorised. One of them is translated by Dilip Kumar Shrestha and published by the same firm, the Panchpokhari Publication House. Another Nepali iteration of the book is published by Book For All publication and translated by Kopila MD. Yet another Nepali version is translated by one Sudheer Dixit and published by Plata Publication, Kathmandu.In an email conversation with the Post, Ronson Taylor, who oversees the international rights at The Rich Dad Company, said, “At this point in time, we do not have a relationship with an established publisher in the [Nepali] language market. If there are any Rich Dad Poor Dad books currently for sale in the Nepali market, they are pirated.”Basanta Thapa, a writer and translator, says that many books are being translated of late to make easy money. “But how would the quality of these unauthorised translations be!” Thapa wonders. “Readers who haven’t read the original wouldn’t know the faults in the translated versions.” Thapa says that any translator worth his salt aims to ‘recreate’ a book and it takes much work to do that.Taslima’s books are the major victimsTaslima’s memoir Uttal Hawa has been translated into Nepali as ‘Sangharsha’, literally Struggle, and is published by Khoji Publication House. Even though the book in its cover claims that it is an authorised translation from the English version Wild Wind, it is a pirated one. The book is translated by Bikash Basnet and edited by Bhogiraj Chamling. A revised version of the book is edited by Sangeet Srota (Yam Bahadur Chhetri).The same publication house has also published the Nepali translation of the book’s sequel as ‘Prem ra Jeevan’. Publisher Sushil Chalise says that while he is aware that one needs to receive permission from the author or the publisher to translate a book, his efforts to contact Taslima were unsuccessful. Therefore, he had published the version the translator made available to him. Translator Basnet, too, admits he translated the book without Taslima’s permission. “About a decade back, we didn’t know how to ask for permission,” he said.Nepal has the Copyright Act (2002) in place. Before it, there was the The Patent, Design and Trade Mark Act, 2022 (1965) that included intellectual property in its 2006 revision. Even the Muluki Ain (Civil Code) of 1910 BS had a provision about copyright. Moreover, it goes without saying that translating somebody else’s work without permission is immoral.Likewise, Indigo Ink Pvt Ltd has published a Nepali translation of Taslima’s anthology of essays No Country for Women as ‘Aaimai ko Kunai Desh Chhaina’. The book is translated by Krishna Giri and edited by Pramod Pradhan. “I have no idea about the agreement between the publisher and translator,” Pradhan, who is also a children’s book writer, says. “I just copy-edited it upon request.”Bishnukumar Poudel, publisher of Indigo Ink, however, claims that he is still trying to take translation rights for the book. “We translated the book long ago,” he says. “We are still trying to get translation rights.”Indigo is also publishing unauthorised translations under its imprints All Book Store Pvt Ltd, Book for All and Plata Publication. It has published two versions of Rich Dad Poor Dad under those shadow imprints. But Plata Publication is not registered in the Company Registrar’s Office.Pradhan says that many foreign books have had unauthorised translations in Nepali and their quality is poor. Those books are translated not from the original language but from a second or third language, so these translations are bound to have problems, he says. “After I learned that those were unauthorised translations, I have stopped editing them,” Pradhan said.Indian author Shiv Khera’s You Can Win has been translated into Nepali by Bloomsbury India and has granted the distribution rights to Ekta Books. But the book’s unauthorised translations are also found in the market and they don’t even mention the name of the publisher and translator. What is interesting is they mention that it’d be illegal to republish the book, or an excerpt of it, without the author’s permission.The Nepali translation of the book, which was poorly written and rife with inaccuracies, had landed the publisher at court. After a complaint was filed at the District Court Kathmandu in 2066BS on the charge that the publisher violated the copyrights and economic rights, the court had issued a verdict on Mangsir 11 that year, charging a fine of Rs10,000, Rs20,000 and Rs30,000 to the defendants Netra Prasad Pokharel, Narayan Prasad Bhusal, and Bhagwati Risal and Bishnu Silwal, respectively.Baral, the Fineprint publisher, says that international publishers wouldn’t demand much for translation rights given Nepal’s small market, but Nepali publishers do not bother to reach out to them. “Publishers who put out unauthorised translations and sell them at 50 percent discount have troubled publishers like us,” he said.Fineprint has published authorised translated versions of books such as Leaving Microsoft to Change the World by John Wood, Healed by Manisha Koirala, and Hippie by Paulo Coelho. The publication house is also set to release the Nepali translation of Israeli historian Yuval Noah Harari’s bestseller Sapiens. Translated into Nepali by Dinesh Kafle, the book’s translation right was acquired at the cost of USD1300, Baral said. Likewise, the publication acquired the translation rights of Sadhguru’s Inner Engineering at IRS93,000, he added.Baral says that publication of unauthorised translations is an immoral and illegal work. “This phenomenon not just hampers Nepal’s fledgling book publishing industry but also tarnishes the country’s reputation in the global market,” Baral said.Thapa, the writer and translator, points out the lack of regulatory mechanisms in the country. “We don’t have an agency that regulates the quality of translations being done,” he says. “Nobody compares the translation with the original. We need a dedicated authority to enhance the quality of translation.” Universities, Nepal Academy and other stakeholders can play a role to uplift the translation sector, he adds.One’s pain, another’s pleasureWhen the author Suketu Mehta was travelling through Mumbai, a young man approached him with a handful of books while his vehicle was stuck in traffic. Brandishing Maximum City, written by none other than Mehta himself, the young man requested the author to buy a copy. Suketu leafed through the book and said, “This is a pirated copy and I’m the author of this book.” The youth wasn’t bothered and replied, “Okay, you can buy it at a discount.”This anecdote was shared to the Post by Mehta’s friend, the author and professor Amitava Kumar, in an email exchange.Most of these pirated books are imported into Nepal from India while the retailers of original books are finding themselves increasingly in trouble. “We sell original copies but many readers doubt us as well, given the ubiquity of pirated versions,” says Anjan Shrestha, operator of Education Book House, Jamal.Ramchandra Timothy, chair of Thapathali-based Ekta Books Pvt Ltd, said that the phenomenon of piracy has tarnished Nepal’s image internationally. “There was a time when Bangladesh would be known as ‘piracy king’,” he said. “Now there's a risk Nepal would take the crown.”As tax increases, so does piracyThe government decision to impose a 10 percent tax on book imports in fiscal year 2019-20 led to a proliferation of pirated book markets, booksellers say. After the decision, booksellers started to cut back on imports and that led to the entry of a new crop of pirated booksellers, a trader in Kathmandu says. But following widespread backlash, then finance minister Bishnu Paudel struck down the policy.“After the government’s decision, we stopped importing books for a while,” says Shrestha of Education Books. “The import of books went down for about two years. Then the pirates stepped in to fill the gap. It was about that time that pirated copies of biographies and memoirs of Obamas and Jai Shettys became omnipresent in the market.”Pirated copies of classics by Roald Dahl and JK Rowling also made an entry in the Nepali market. Then the phenomenon only saw a rise.Since the customs department does not levy duty on foreign books and also does not care to differentiate between the pirated and original copies, unauthorised books have found a safe haven in Nepali market.The government doesn’t levy any customs duty on books and newspapers published by foreign publishers abroad. The importers should only pay Rs565 at the customs points. But Nepali publishers have to pay 10 percent tax to import books printed in India.James Taylor, director of Communications and Freedom to Publish of the International Publishers Association, says that the government, publishers, writers and readers should join hands to control widespread piracy. “The government should realise that book publishing and reading culture contribute to the country’s economy as well,” he said, adding that the government should seize pirated books and close websites that sell pirated ebooks.Nandan Jha, executive vice chair of Penguin Random House India’s sales, production and business department, says that piracy has emerged as a big challenge for publishers of late and has harmed the authors, publishers, distributors, printers, readers and other stakeholders. “To confront piracy, all the stakeholders should launch a special joint effort,” Jha told the Post in an email exchange.Piracy has proliferated in the Nepali market to such an extent that the publishers of such books and unauthorised translations keep whatever ISBN numbers they like, often conflicting with other books, and still get off scot free. If scanned or searched on the internet, the ISBN number gives details on the author of the book, what the book is about, and its price, among others.Bijay Sharma, information officer at TU Library, says, “Keeping ISBN number at one’s will is illegal. If anyone files a complaint, we can punish them.”By the lawThe Muluki Ain-1910 BS had mandated that a publisher take permission of Gorkha Bhasa Prakashini Samiti before publishing any material. The Copyrights Act came into effect in 2022 BS and was amended in 2054 BS. In 2059 BS, a new Act was promulgated and it is still effective now. Authorities are currently working to amend the Act to give the registrar’s office more autonomy regarding copyright.According to the 2059 BS Act, copyright violations are considered government cases. In such cases, plaintiffs should file a complaint with the police. The Act’s clause 25 has various conditions that amount to violation of copyright. The Act’s subclause A says that if a publisher produces or copies material in writing or sound and sells or distributes it, it amounts to violation of copyright.Likewise, the Act’s clause 26 prevents selling of unauthorised material. The clause restricts the ‘importation of copies of work or sound recording, either made in a foreign country or sourced otherwise, into Nepal for business purpose shall not be permitted if preparation of such copies would be considered illegal if they were prepared in Nepal.’If anyone infringes upon protected rights, they are liable to punishment but the provision’s implementation remains lax.The law gives the authority to district court to take legal action against copyright violators.Advocate Parshuram Koirala says that if the government becomes more proactive, it can punish violators on the basis of the 2059 BS Act and thereby control the phenomenon of intellectual theft and copyright violations. “Creation is a crucial part of humanity’s benefit,” he says. “If intellectual property is not protected effectively, then there’d be no inspiration to create something.”Bal Bahadur Mukhiya, a professor at Nepal Law Campus, suggests the inclusion of rules about digital piracy in law, and also the clauses of various related international treaties and agreements that Nepal is part of.“In the US, a teacher or professor should pay a certain revenue even to photocopy a chapter of some text for teaching purposes,” Mukhiya says. “But in Nepal, those who photocopy an entire book and sell it go scot free.”(This report is prepared in collaboration with the Centre for Investigative Journalism, Nepal.) \nWhenever I mention that I’m researching Nepal’s Grand Strategy, the initial reaction I often get—even from well-informed individuals—is one of disbelief. Although they are too polite to say it aloud, I can almost hear them thinking, “Are you out of your mind?”Many people doubt whether Nepal’s democratic governments of the post-1990 era can formulate a coherent foreign policy, let alone deliberate on a grand strategy. The psychological outlook we’ve inherited as citizens of a country sandwiched between two giants and the chaotic nature of our foreign policy establishment fuel this scepticism. Adding to that is the nostalgia for the finesse and pomp with which the palace once operated. Is there some truth to these perceptions?The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MoFA) has been primarily relegated to administrative functions, lacking both intellectual direction and a political mandate from the top leadership. The Nepali Defence Ministry is often jokingly called a “post box.” But has the MoFA’s role dwindled to a little more than passport printing and logistical support for foreign visits?Our top leaders' overreliance on personal dealings with foreign counterparts—often through non-state intermediaries—continues to tarnish public perception and weaken the foreign policy establishment as a whole. During extreme crises and trust deficits, relying on private individuals or non-state actors as messengers and influencers may be acceptable. However, habitually abusing it undermines state capacity and risks state interest manipulation.Foreign Minister Arzu Rana Deuba’s visit to India last week elicited scepticism in some quarters. However, the optics of meeting top Indian leaders were hailed by many as proof of a successful visit. Rana in DelhiRana's red-carpet treatment in New Delhi, including a meeting with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, symbolises India’s comfort with the Nepali Congress’ presence in the new ruling coalition. There is no denying that the Nepali Congress is favourably regarded in New Delhi and Washington, which speaks to the party's legacy and ability to communicate with these key partners. Moreover, we cannot misread the hospitality accorded to Rana, a significant Nepali Congress leader and the spouse of the prime minister-in-waiting.One might assume that Rana carried a message from Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli, assuring New Delhi that Kathmandu seeks to maintain cordial relations and resolve bilateral irritants, including the Kalapani issue and Nepal’s new map, through mutual consultation. However, the pre-departure press release from MoFA was terse, stating that Rana would “discuss matters of mutual interest.” The Indian press release offered more details, mentioning discussions on the “full range of the India-Nepal bilateral partnership,” including progress on power trade and sports cooperation. Later, the Nepali embassy in Delhi made cursory references to various issues, including air routes for Bhairahawa and Pokhara airports.Many issues need to be resolved: Kalapani, air routes, preferential treatment for Nepali goods, Nepali recruitments in the Indian Army after the Agniveer scheme and the Eminent Persons Group (EPG) report, among others. Despite numerous high-level exchanges annually or with every government change on both sides, the issues regarding perceived security sensitivities have been ring-fenced; there seems to be a tacit agreement between both governments to remain quiet about this matter. Instead, both sides want to oversell the issues of high-voltage optics around development. “Yes, we agreed to add another 200 MW of electricity to an already bright bilateral relationship.” Deferring discussions on these difficult issues only festers the problem. While Nepal needs to respect India’s genuine security concerns and proactively address them, the latter needs to stop exaggerating its security sensitivities to impede things it doesn’t like.Overall, the visit was limited mainly to symbolism—a courtesy call to Nepal’s most important partner by a new foreign minister, conveying an invitation from a prime minister perceived as difficult in New Delhi due to his nationalist stance and occasional ‘leanings toward Beijing.’Initially, the Indian Ministry of External Affairs was comparatively more transparent and offered some substance beyond the vague reference to usual ‘issues of mutual interest.’ Additionally, Indian press reports mentioned that Rana would use the visit for a health check-up. I don’t believe that Nepali government departments are inherently less transparent than their Indian counterparts. The issue lies in our permanent governments' diminishing involvement in setting the agenda for high-level exchanges, especially with key partners and subsequent public communication. Compared to their Indian counterparts, MoFA officials appear to have less space and autonomy to shape the visit’s agenda. Politicians caught up in their myopic power struggles can perhaps be forgiven for failing to consider civil service reforms. However, it’s astonishing that no chief secretary has advocated strengthening the permanent government’s strategy in the last decade. Instead, some have tried installing cameras to monitor their colleagues without addressing the root causes of poor performance. So, it is appropriate to question whether the problem lies in the structure, the hiring policies, the pay incentives, the skillsets, or all of the above.The more politicians and civil servants undermine the role of Nepali institutions, the more the agency of Nepal and Nepalis will diminish, and it will become more favourable for powerful foreign influencers to dictate everything. Greater transparency, restoration of normal administrative processes and strict adherence to standard operating procedures in diplomatic dealings are the only ways to restore the credibility lost in the public’s eyes. Allowing public cynicism to fester is, in many ways, akin to a self-fulfilling prophecy, as beliefs are as powerful as actual events. \nA popular question often arises in the international sphere: Will Nepal fall under China’s influence? It is generally assumed that leftist parties in Nepal are close to China and democratic parties to India and the US. As a result, the leftists are assumed to favour Chinese interests and the latter favour India’s interests in the emerging geopolitical game.During our closed-door dialogue with several influential leaders from the Nepali Congress, CPN-UML and the Maoist Centre who have held important ministries, one takeaway was that Nepali political leaders across major parties have a sophisticated understanding of Nepal’s core national interests concerning geopolitics. Despite divergent ideologies and differing affinities with China and India, they have surprising commonalities in their policy positions. However, on Nepal’s external relations, the problem is not about fundamental differences in defining national interests or political affinities with India and China. The issue lies in managing four key factors that subvert policy positions: Geo-political squeeze, narrow political interests, corruption dynamics and weak negotiation capacities.Geopolitical pressuresGeo-political competition in Nepal is most apparent in five arenas: Political influence, connectivity and critical infrastructure, market, resources and security. Our political leaders and decision-makers are under immense pressure from the big powers to make decisions that suit their interests in these areas.In recent years, China has sought to cultivate close ties with political parties, especially those on the left, and encourage “independence” from India’s influence. Political influence is linked to the global rivalry in political values and world visions offered by China and the US. As a result, big powers have attempted to influence Nepal’s role in the international arena, including the United Nations. For the big powers, political influence is also a means of achieving their interests in connectivity, infrastructure, markets, resources and security. Such competition, if not managed, can lead to severe conflicts.After the peace process, India became wary of China’s influence in Nepal. This rivalry intensified after the 2017 Doklam standoff and the 2020 Galwan Valley conflict. Consequently, India began to discourage Chinese engagements in Nepal. India-China relations directly impact Chinese investments’ feasibility in Nepal, including the Trans-Himalayan Multi-Dimensional Connectivity Network, which aspires to access the Indian market. It is apparent that Chinese investments in the hydropower sector have shrunk due to India’s policy on power trade. Therefore, the goals of the Nepal-China Industrial Park in Damak are achievable only if relations between India and China improve.Nepal’s critical infrastructure, including transmission lines, telecommunications and digital infrastructure, is another sensitive sector. Geopolitical actors' involvement in these sectors may generate further vulnerabilities for Nepal’s national security.Multiple cases worldwide have demonstrated that geopolitical competition is also about tapping resources and raw materials. Nepal has a few resources that China needs. However, Chinese companies have benefited from substantial procurement contracts, funded mainly by Nepal and multilateral agencies.For China, Nepal is an attractive market in the short term and a gateway to South Asia in the long term. China’s engagements with Nepal and its policies in Tibet indicate that the country is betting big on accessing the South Asian market. However, this is another area in which India is very sensitive. Given China and India’s emphasis on security, they will exert more pressure on Nepal’s security sector, which receives little attention in Nepali public space.Vulnerabilities and potential conflictOur foreign policy goals should focus on resisting external economic and political pressures, avoiding geopolitical conflict, fostering trusted relationships with India and China and aligning external relations with our national interests. So, it is essential to recognise and address our vulnerabilities first. The leverage big powers have in shaping political leaders’ careers and domestic power dynamics is the major source of vulnerability in foreign policy decision-making. As external actors offer significant incentives, political leaders must fear them and be eager to appease them for personal benefit.Corruption and financial interests continue to influence some of Nepal’s policy decisions. In the case of Pokhara International Airport, political actors, influenced by kickbacks and economic interests, moved the process from outside government institutions and mobilised the public to pressure decision-makers. The prevalence of many such cases shows that corruption dynamics will continue to influence decision-making across all political spectrums and other sectors unless we have accountability and transparency in aid and infrastructure projects.Nepal’s vulnerability also stems from weak negotiation capacity and communication skills. Regarding dealing with big powers, Nepal lacks the necessary diplomatic mechanisms, skills and knowledge to promote national interest. It must take immediate steps to reduce the potential for geopolitical conflict. First, Nepal must set a clear course on the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). China is pushing the BRI by gradually subsuming all forms of bilateral cooperation under the BRI framework. However, the implications of China's move are not yet clear. Although Nepal has already signed the BRI and should look forward to the initiative, it must enhance its negotiation capacity, address vulnerable areas and communicate better with China and other big powers to ensure mutual benefit.Given the rivalry between India and China, Nepal must ensure that China feels safe from India’s engagements and vice versa. Nepal once had an informal policy where Chinese small-scale aid was limited to the northern districts and Indian small-scale aid was limited to the southern districts. However, the situation has changed in recent years as Chinese activities have increased in the southern border areas, and Indian activities have increased in the northern border areas. Nepal must ensure that such activities do not generate security dilemmas.Another immediate step is to communicate Nepal’s position on security cooperation through a white paper to provide no room for misunderstanding among big powers about what Nepal will and will not do. Such a paper will be critical in developing trusted relations with big powers amidst growing geo-political rivalry. To reduce geopolitical conflict and ensure national interest, all political parties and leaders must agree to a common code of conduct for cultivating relations with external forces and political actors, which must be communicated well to international actors.After all, the question for Nepal is not about whether it will fall under China’s influence but how it can benefit from geopolitical competition and maintain a trusted relationship with all the big powers. \nMigration has been a prominent feature of Nepali society for most of its history. The initial large outflow for enrolment in the British and Indian armies, migration to India for work, and labour migration to the Gulf countries and Malaysia represent three epochs that have characterised its trend over the last 200 years. Although, ostensibly, toiling in the sun in the Arab countries differs considerably from fighting as mercenaries in the two world wars, the two have more in common than is perceptible at first glance. Circumstances, conditions and implications of migration and return have been perpetuated or allowed by those in power. The agency of migrants and their ability to render migration an informed choice remains attenuated for most, with migration still a compulsion and an agonising familial separation to sustain livelihood. Migration continues to be “choreographed” for the majority, even if not to the levels of inducement, enjoinment and coercion practised by the Rana regime to supply recruits to the British Indian army.The choreographyBir Shumsher, to solicit British support for his nascent regime after ascending to premier, agreed to their wishes of expanding the extant Gurkha battalions and supplied recruits accordingly from 1885. It then precipitated during the First World War and was later replicated by Juddha Shumsher during the Second World War. The Ranas employed every tactic in the book to supply recruits, enticing not only the recruits and the recruiters but also village leaders; many were coerced and forced to enlist. This explicit migration choreography would be considered a violation of human rights in contemporary times. Notwithstanding, the migration of Nepalis for work abroad continues to be choreographed to a large extent, albeit more subtly.The opening line of Warsan Shire’s poem, Home, “No one leaves home unless home is the mouth of a shark”, captures the emotions of many Nepali migrant workers who feel compelled to leave the country. With the grim prospects within the country, particularly for those who could not avail themselves of quality education available only in select regions, migration becomes inevitable. Rather than a voluntary application of one’s right to mobility, it is an avenue to ensure livelihood for many as a last resort. The government has done little to deter outmigration but instead has allowed the perpetuation of the structural factors that necessitate it. Further, notwithstanding the speeches of political leaders, government policies encourage labour migration, as evidenced by inducements such as allotments to migrant workers in the public offerings of companies in the Nepal Stock Exchange and the recently introduced collateral-free loans for those repatriating remittances. There is a discrepancy between the proclaimed goal of enhancing employment opportunities within the country and the policies formulated.Tendentious market power asymmetries characterise the global labour market, leaving migrant workers with little bargaining strength. The supply of workers is much higher than its demand, so governments and companies in destination countries can dictate favourable terms and conditions with little resistance. Destination country governments treat migrant workers as second-class citizens, allowing no opportunities for naturalisation and imposing stringent restrictions on mobility. Employer companies similarly confiscate passports and discriminate based on age, laying off migrant workers who are past their prime working years. Thus, migrant workers are dismissed years after investing in the job, causing skills and confidence loss. They are labelled with the epithet “temporary workers”, which is as exploitative as it is denigrating. Through this, the origin country bears the burden of their unproductive years—childhood and old age—while destination countries reap the benefits but externalise the costs.The agency of the migrant workers is compromised both in their decision to migrate and return. Institutional structures compel them to dance to the choreography imposed by other actors who also profit from their migration.Maintaining the status quo Outmigration from Nepal for work has had the pernicious effect of acting as a palliative to maintain the national order—political or economic—allowing those in power to avoid painful reform measures. Although not as unequivocal as the Rana regime's ploy to stay in power, today's import-based economy relies on remittances to sustain itself. Without this insulation, it is inconceivable how the economic order would be maintained, even in the short term.Another aspect of this is the surplus labour in the country. Labour migration from Nepal constitutes a virtuous cycle whereby its surplus migrates to foreign nations with labour shortages or demands. It does not divest the Nepali industrial or service sectors of labour but helps match the excess human resources with jobs abroad, producing optimal outcomes. The migrant workers repatriate remittances in return—a win-win.However, this highlights the inability of the Nepali economy to absorb these workers. They would be either unemployed or underemployed without the option to migrate, bringing about social and political turmoil. Migration is thus essential in the short term but with the dangers of lulling policymakers into inaction and producing moral hazard by allowing them to escape by not implementing painful but necessary reforms.Migrant worker woesDespite this indispensability, it is migrant workers who face the brunt of the consequences. They migrate for 3D (dirty, dangerous and difficult) jobs, which renders them vulnerable to abuse and exploitation. The Nepali government has resorted to imprudent, blanket approaches to protect migrant workers, with the feckless bans on female labour migration for domestic work serving as an example. Again, these bans choreograph migrations based on state expediency without considering migrant workers’ compulsion to migrate, thus exacerbating their vulnerabilities by forcing them to use informal routes. They have, however, allowed the government an excuse when questioned.When the utility of migrant workers is assumed to have waned, they are discarded by governments and employers in destination countries without sufficient financial assistance or an alternative option back home. The disbandment of the Gurkha battalions in the aftermath of the Second World War still serves as a poignant picture. The same is true for migrant workers in the Gulf, many of whom earn enough to educate their children but not to retire. Most of them engage in menial work post-return, as the skills they learnt abroad are inapplicable in the Nepali job market, all the while looking for opportunities to remigrate. Despite such hardships, they cannot escape the structural factors that prompted their migration in the first place. \nOur roads are becoming increasingly unsafe due to poor and haphazard construction, natural disasters. But more often than not, it is because our drivers are overworked, and there is hardly any solid monitoring mechanism in place to check their physical and mental status. Providing resting time for drivers becomes even more crucial during monsoons, when landslides obstruct roads and the journeys become longer.Realising the need to provide drivers with resting time and place, the Lumbini Province Government started building five “smart refresh centres” in Bardaghat in Nawalparasi West, Sainamaina in Rupandehi, Chandrauta in Kapilvastu, Lamahi in Dang, and Bardiya along the East-West Highway four years ago. These centres promise washrooms, eateries, restrooms, shower rooms, charging stations, parking area, among other amenities, to help drivers and passengers tackle fatigue during long-distance travels. However, due to budget constraints, the project hasn’t seen the light of day yet. While the idea of starting the refresh centres is laudable, there is a clear lack of coordination among political parties to complete the project. The ambitious project took shape in Lumbini during the CPN-UML government when it set aside around Rs110 million. But the government was ousted even as it began construction work, and the new government, led by the Maiosts, slashed the budget for the project. The project got shelved by subsequent governments. Even though the first phase of the project (only the construction of the building) has been completed in Sainamaina, its operation has been halted as it lacks proper guidelines for functioning. The experiment in Lumbini has been a failed project.Nepal’s Motor Vehicle and Transport Management Act mandates drivers to rest after six hours of driving. However, the authorities have failed to enforce the rules, let alone arrange proper rest areas for the drivers. Safer roads not only improve road safety but also help the country's tourism flourish. As we strive to expand our tourism agenda by attracting more tourists, the importance of ensuring basic resting facilities along the highways cannot be overstated. Providing the best services for tourists will attract them to the country, thereby boosting our economy and buttressing international reputation. While it is encouraging that several other provinces have rest centres along highways, the conditions are far from decent. Most of these centres lack basic sanitary and hygiene services. Moreover, such small projects lack sufficient construction as well as maintenance funds, as has been the case in Lumbini. The governments’ tendency to consider them “trivial” is equally concerning. Such a mindset not only hinders our journey towards making roads safer but also other opportunities that come along with it, including tourism promotion and passenger satisfaction. As highway accidents become a regular phenomenon in Nepal, we need more smart refresh centres. The federal government should therefore come on board and help provincial and local governments construct these centres through enough budget allocation on need basis. It is also necessary to devise a plan to maintain and renovate existing ones that lack enough amenities for drivers and passengers. Meanwhile, political parties should heed the projects that are in the best interests of people, and not weigh them on the basis of whether they fall under their party’s priority or not. \nThe energy sector remained one of Nepal’s most vibrant sectors for over a year. Some encouraging news brightened the country’s mood even as the overall economy remained stagnant. In June last year, Nepal and India inked a long-term power trade agreement, whereby the southern neighbour would import 10,000 MW of hydroelectricity from Nepal in 10 years. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi made the announcement at a joint press meet with Nepali counterpart Pushpa Kamal Dahal, who was on a visit to India. Based on the same deal, India has been gradually increasing the quantum of energy it is importing from Nepal. On Monday, New Delhi approved a plan to import an additional 251 MW of electricity from Nepal, increasing the total imports to nearly 1,000 MW. Nepal, which was heavily dependent on India’s electricity until a few years ago, became a net exporter of electricity last fiscal. Encouraged by the potential market in India and other neighbouring countries including Bangladesh, investors have been injecting huge investments in this sector. Work to build transmission lines and substations has picked up in recent months. Nepal and Bangladesh were all set to sign an agreement last month on the export of Nepal’s 40 MW of electricity via India, only to be cancelled due to political unrest in the South Asian nation. Even as Nepal makes great strides in electricity production and exports, our villages still remain unelectrified. According to the Nepal Electricity Authority’s latest report, 18 of the country’s 753 local government units are not connected to the national grid. According to the NEA report published on Tuesday, 1 percent of the total population is still deprived of the basic facility. Even in the rest of the parts of the country covered by the national grid, electricity supply is still erratic. Moreover, while the import of electric vehicles (EVs) is rising, exhibiting a keen interest among Nepalis to switch from fossil fuel to electricity, the government doesn’t seem to be keeping pace. While it is yet to build the infrastructure for electric vehicles, including charging stations, its policy on import and sales of such vehicles isn’t consistent. Another important area where the government should concentrate its efforts on is increasing the consumption of electricity in the kitchens of Nepalis across the country. The ministry of energy should devise some attractive schemes to replace cooking gas with electric stoves. Authorities don’t seem to be seriously working on these fronts. Instead, the government at times looks derailed. At a time when it needs to expedite work to replace fossil fuel-based activities with electricity, the government is preparing to build oil pipeline connecting Siliguri of India to Charali in Jhapa, a greenfield tank terminal in Charali, and an extension of the pipeline from Amlekhgunj to Lothar in Chitwan with India’s support.Promoting electricity and fossil fuel usage at the same time, the government seems to be trying to have it both ways. This approach is wrong approach. What the government should do is to formulate a clear policy of promoting clean energy-based activities and formulate a comprehensive plan on energy production and consumption. That should be guided by the approach of increasing domestic consumption and exporting surplus production. This strategy has multiple benefits. Replacement of the huge quantity of imported fossil fuels with electricity saves billions of rupees, helps rejuvenate the country’s economy and decarbonises the transport and other sectors. \nIn June, when the Cabinet decided to make National Identity Card (NID) mandatory for accessing government services, including social security allowances, it was widely criticised, with even federal lawmakers voicing their disapproval. The Home Ministry had announced that the directive would be enforced in 28 districts, setting a deadline of mid-July. This decision had “terrorised people”, as they feared they would be deprived of social security services, and many registered in haste.But the government last month decided to overturn the directive with equal haste. Now, the Nepalis are left confused: To obtain it or not to obtain it? Seemingly disbelieving the government's changing position on the use of the NID, over half a million people opted for it between mid-June to mid-July. Yet, there is little information about whether the government has worked out the behind-the-scenes procedures for its proper utility. Despite the NID’s design to combine important identity cards and documents including driving licenses, academic documents, voting cards, insurance details, and ATM card numbers in a single chip, implementing agencies still lack the infrastructure for such an endeavour. This technological hurdle adds to the already challenging task of fully executing the NID card campaign six years after the government started distributing it. Moreover, the hubbub surrounding the NID’s “revolutionary” function has proven to be dubious—it is either of no use or is imposed arbitrarily on the people. This is a prime example of how our authorities care not to think about its citizens' comfort or welfare when they come up with new policies or schemes. The authorities' main argument for implementing the NID is that it will be a one-stop solution for surveilling and controlling criminal activities like financial fraud by removing duplication. Article 51 of the Constitution of Nepal 2015 pledges to develop an integrated national identity management information system and manage citizens' data. The NID and Registration Act 2020 states that personal privacy would be ensured in its usage. But experts believe the document has several loopholes as it does not discuss data protection. Sensitive data and information of the citizens are the nation's assets, and they must be safeguarded diligently. However, the government is yet to fully assure citizens about data privacy; what is working in the government’s favour is that many lack digital literacy enough to know about their privacy rights. Moreover, the government has not clearly explained how it plans to segregate information access by multiple agencies, as the NID provides an integrated database of different information. This paints a murky picture of Nepal’s cyber security ecosystem, as data security is fragile, and hackers often target government websites. Ever since the launch of the Adhaar Card in India, there have been numerous cases of duping, misuse and information leak. The government must learn from the mistakes of its next-door neighbour before launching a “grand” campaign to digitalise identification. The government would do well to return to the basics before taking any further steps and clearly address the concerns of experts, lawmakers and citizens about why and how the card is an important addition to other identifications like citizenship, driving license, and passport. Moreover, the authorities should first ideate on the utility, functionality and safety of the NID before imposing it on the citizens.  \nLately, road accidents are taking place almost every day. Thousands of people lose their lives in road crashes every year across the country. What are the factors causing these disasters? Why have the authorities failed to prevent them? The Post's Thira Lal Bhusal sat down with former secretary Arjun Jung Thapa, who was director general at the Department of Roads for years, to discuss the pressing issue.Why are road accidents taking place so frequently in Nepal? There is no one reason for road accidents. On the infrastructure front, factors like design, condition and geometry of a road are crucial. Putting sign boards along the roads and giving vital information about the particular location is necessary. Those signs should be placed properly so all driving vehicles and passengers can see them clearly. Some technical aspects, such as whether the superelevation is properly designed, particularly at sharp bends, matter greatly. These must be regularly monitored and corrected in time. Regular vehicle fitness tests are essential. Experienced and disciplined drivers are equally important to ensure road safety. Some accidents occur when drivers are unfamiliar with the roads. For instance, the accident that took place at Anbukhaireni of Tanahun district on Friday, killing 27 Indian nationals, might have been because of the driver’s lack of familiarity with the road condition. Yet another serious concern is the lack of road discipline. Those who come to Nepal with years-long experience of driving abroad fear driving because of motorists' reckless driving and lack of lane discipline. The recent accident at Jadibuti, killing one scooter rider, could have been avoided if proper lane discipline had been followed. Reckless driving by motorcyclists has remained a big problem in our case. So, a separate lane should be designated for bikers. Similarly, lanes should be designated for vehicles based on their speed. But such rules are never followed seriously in our case. Traffic police have been entrusted with enforcing traffic rules but lack the human resources to enforce them effectively. We need an integrated and centrally controlled digital traffic light management system. We had experimented with a system as a trial for some time after 2015. We called a bid but couldn’t accept anyone as the bidders proposed more than the rate we had fixed. The project collapsed, and that system could never be revived. We badly lack technology in this sector. When we try to import technology, brokers get involved and ruin the entire process. The condition of roads built haphazardly, mainly in the hills, is another major concern. What do you say about that?We have built around 80,000 kilometres of road across the country. Of that, only around 14,000 kilometres fall under the jurisdiction of the road department. The rest of the road sections fall under the jurisdiction of various authorities, such as the Department of Local Infrastructure and provincial and local governments. The busiest roads are those under the Department of Roads. They are highways and regional roads. Only 50 percent of the roads overseen by the Department of Roads are blacktopped and are not maintained properly. Of the remaining 65,000 kilometres of road, only 4,000 kilometres are blacktopped. This means that the road condition across the country is poor and must be upgraded. The government will now develop the Kakarvitta-Gorusinghe section of the East-West Highway as a safe demonstration corridor. There will be proper infrastructure for crossings, grade-separated intersections, controlled entries, fencing for the safety from wild animals and crossings for wildlife. Local vehicles will run on service lanes. If it is developed as planned, it would be on par with Asian standards. Other roads in the pipeline will follow these standards. These criteria are being implemented while upgrading the Nagdhunga-Mugling road section as well. We have miles to go to upgrade our roads to international standards. Why are we failing to make quality roads?We can’t build our roads according to the original design. At times, locals obstruct road construction and force us to change the alignments. Then, we have to build them based on the availability of the land.Are our rural roads fit from the engineering perspective?Around 35,000 kilometers out of the 65,000 kilometers of roads that don’t fall under the jurisdiction of the Department of Roads are built randomly. Local leaders, influential individuals, and bulldozer operators fix the alignments of such roads.How can we rectify the malpractices in this sector?We need to activate the National Road Safety Council urgently. Officials from all the concerned departments and representatives from various stakeholders should sit together in this body and find solutions. Also, coordination has become more complicated in the federal system. For instance, highways are under federal jurisdiction, transport management on highways falls under provincial authority, while road management is under federal jurisdiction. Therefore, an effective coordinating body has become a must. Otherwise, we can’t control the increasing trend of deaths in road accidents. At least 1,700 people lost their lives in 2013, and the then government set a target to reduce it by at least 50 percent by 2020. Instead, the yearly death toll has crossed 2,800 now.While it takes years to complete road upgrading tasks, construction materials are left unmanaged and scattered, making driving along the road very difficult and dangerous. Can’t such things be improved?Contractors are powerful because of their political connection with influential leaders including prime ministers and ministers. Civil servants can’t be assertive when the contractors get political protection. At times, they try to use force to coerce government officials. If the situation is not going in their favour, they provoke locals with a plan to get extension in their contract citing local unrest. Experts say that the government is also to blame as it doesn’t carry out development projects properly. Do you agree?I worked for three decades in government agencies until a few months ago. What I found is that one government devises specific policies, plans and initiates certain projects but successive governments stop them. The new leadership starts its own plans and projects. Then, the contractors don’t get their payment. This is the other side of the story. Another problem is that our ministers, lawmakers and leaders show interest in the projects that deserve the least priority while important projects don’t get attention. For instance, around 30 kilometers of Arniko Highway, which connects Nepal with China, has been badly damaged. This is a very important road for the country. Can’t the government repair and maintain a 30-kilometer section of a highway? It requires just around Rs3 billion whereas leaders have allocated over Rs11.5 billion in the projects of personal interests of leaders. Around Rs4 billion has been allocated under lawmakers’ constituency development programmes and additional Rs5 billion has been earmarked for local bridges. We have allocated around Rs60 billion for non-important projects but we have ignored a crucial road, Arniko Highway, which was built with the support of our neighbour China in the 1960s. Thus we have given unnecessary importance where it doesn’t deserve while ignoring vital development projects. The road accidents are directly or indirectly linked to the government’s wrong policies and plans.Development projects are sometimes said to have failed due to rivalry between some leaders. Do you have any such experience?I will give you an example. In the Biratnagar-Bathnaha cross-border rail project, we had to build over 13 kilometers of the railway. It was around four to five years ago. We cleared over 11 kilometers but locals protested in the remaining section where a station was planned. The locals obstructed work there even as 85 percent of the money for land acquisition had already been distributed. Later, we found that the then minister Aman Lal Modi had provoked the locals to demand for additional money. He demanded a ‘special rate for his men’. But the laws don’t allow it.Some experts argue that to upgrade the quality of our roads, we need to make this sector competitive and, for that, we have to allow the private sector to develop projects. Is it viable?The government is hindering the private sector from entering into this business. They don’t invest without assured returns. They need roads like Kathmandu-Tarai Expressway. The government called for proposals in the build-operate-transfer (BOT) model for this project. They were interested. But the government simultaneously allowed a company to build the Kathmandu-Tunnel Road in the same area. Then the investors felt a risk to invest there. But, the company couldn’t continue the tunnel project. Private sector should be welcomed in this sector but we should create a conducive environment for that. Bangladesh and India have built infrastructure projects under the BOT model. We can do it as well.What do you think about the jurisdictional dispute over the New Road stretch between the Kathmandu Metropolis and the Department of Roads? Who should maintain this road?All the roads within the metropolis fall under the local government’s jurisdiction, as the constitution clearly states. The federal department is managing the roads with the understanding that the local governments are not efficient at maintaining them for now. If a local unit wants to maintain a certain road section on its own, the department should allow it without any dispute. Both sides showed childish behaviour while handling the New Road case. \nCPN (Unified Socialist) leader Ram Kumari Jhakri was among the most active leaders involved in the formation of the party after split with the CPN-UML in 2021. Three years on, she is now the most vocal leader calling for a unification of the two parties. Why didn’t the new party perform well, and what made her lobby for a party merger? Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal sat with former minister Jhakri for more insights.You worked actively to form the CPN (Unified Socialist), but the party couldn’t perform well. It couldn’t even become a national party from the general elections. What went wrong?We formed the CPN (Unified Socialist) out of compulsion. When Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli—who was prime minister at the time as well—dissolved the House of Representatives in December 2020, we firmly stood against his move, saying that it sowed the seeds of political instability. We staged huge protests and moved the Supreme Court against the decision of Oli, our party chair at the time. I was among the petitioners. Once the top court reinstated the House, we expected the party to move smoothly. Unfortunately, that couldn’t happen. The party establishment led by Oli and the rival faction took extreme actions against each other. The agitating faction announced action against the party chair, and the party establishment expelled us from the party itself. When Oli dissolved the House a second time, we protested the move as it brought instability. We were in favour of transforming the party through intra-party struggle, but the situation took some unexpected turns. We didn’t quit the party with a lofty plan of making a new revolutionary organisation. We were compelled to do so.Our new party accommodated many genuine leaders who had been sidelined in the UML. But ultimately, old leaders heavily dominated the new party’s central committee. They were active leaders of their time but were out of touch with the new, changing context. Young leaders didn’t get space in party committees. I proposed recruiting at least 40 percent members under 40 years in the central committee and over 50 percent members under 30 years in the district committees. I made a 29-year-old leader the chair of the district committee in my home district. In 42 days, I attended 36 district conventions where youths in their 30s were elected district committee chairs. I tried to reach out to municipalities to promote youths in the party chapters. But at the central level, old faces dominated party committees. That didn’t attract people to the party or impress the general public. Thus, it failed to gather steam right from the beginning.Many think that Madhav Kumar Nepal’s selection as party chief was a wrong move since he had led the UML for 15 years and become prime minister, and people didn’t find novelty in the new party. Do you think so too?Madhav Kumar Nepal has been the most active leader in the party since its inception. Whatever the party has achieved so far is because of him. But a party leader must mobilise teams with defined roles and responsibilities and continuously motivate and engage them in result-oriented tasks. He works a lot but doesn’t mobilise teams effectively. Observers say the Unified Socialist was formed due to the personality clash between top leaders and that it lacked a national agenda and a clear policy to prove the need for a new party. Do you feel so?Our immediate agenda was safeguarding the constitution and ensuring political stability in the country. We protested the House dissolution guided by the same policy. But when provincial governments were made like satellites of the federal government, we couldn’t play any role in stabilising them.The UML is guided by the policy of People’s Multiparty Democracy, propounded by the late Madan Bhandari. There was a debate on further enhancing the policy in the changed context. A large section of Left intellectuals were interested in contributing to that. We could have engaged them in the process. But our party stopped the debate on that topic as well. We missed the chance of engaging many critical individuals in the discourse and having a relatively different policy. When in the UML, we practised direct elections of party representatives and leaders from the conventions. Unfortunately, leaders of the new party, Unified Socialist, made a statute that gave powers to the party leadership to nominate party secretariat, office bearers and other members. Leaders would pick those who are loyal to them. This regressive approach killed competition in the party.You are known to prefer a more proactive work and decision-making approach. There are rumours that you have been fed up with the party’s lacklustre style and are mulling to join the mother party, UML.If I were to decide only from a personal perspective, I would have done so much earlier because I had multiple opportunities in the past. But I am for party merger because I don’t see any relevance of running multiple retail shops under communist banners because we are not substantially different from each other in terms of policies. Our electoral system has also made it necessary. The Unified Socialist can’t run like this. We must accept reality and decide—merging our party with the UML is better than running it this way. But it seems that the top leaders of the twin parties are still bitter about each other.True, the bitterness lingers on, mainly among the top leaders. We have also made some mistakes. The UML offered some opportunities to the Unified Socialist, and we should have made some offers to capitalise on the favourable situation. At one time, UML leaders proposed our party chair as a candidate for the vacant post of the country’s President. We should have devised our own proposal and made a win-win deal. But we ran away and squandered the opportunity. If Madhav Kumar Nepal had become president on the UML’s proposal, our party might have been reunited with the UML much earlier. I also took an initiative to that end but in vain. Later also, UML chair Oli visited our party chair’s residence to have our party on board the government. But the reaction from our side ruined things. We are certainly not responding to the UML responsibly. Rather than irritate the UML, we must turn each positive gesture into an opportunity for party unity.One more factor is blocking the unity between the two parties. There are a large number of second-rung leaders in the UML who can’t directly confront Oli. They are now encouraging former President Bidya Devi Bhandari to join active politics and trying to make decisions in their favour through her. Oli knows these leaders will support Nepal when he returns to the UML. Why would he [Oli] then merge the fringe party and create another power centre against himself? He knows Madhav Kumar Nepal will challenge him with the backing of the dissidents. It is natural for a leader to think twice before allowing another leader of your stature to create a parallel power centre within the organisation. Even I would have thought twice. This is a major factor hindering party unity.Your party chair and other key leaders seem quite close to CPN (Maoist Centre) chair Pushpa Kamal Dahal and critical of UML chair Oli. Moreover, Oli often lambasts Madhav Kumar Nepal publicly. Will they still merge the parties?In principle, our party is open for unity with any Left party. But party cadres won’t join the Maoist Centre. If our leadership decides to merge the party with the Maoists, a huge number of our party cadres will join the UML. Unity between the UML and the Unified Socialist is natural because we grew up in the same background and orientation. But we are quite different from Maoists. Several groups trying to form new political outfits have failed to emerge as a major political force and sustain themselves. You worked in a big party for years and also helped establish a new one. What are the challenges of forming a new political organisation in Nepal?Political parties sustain if they evolve with society. If you trace the history of the Nepal’s Congress and communist parties, you will see how they have evolved over the past seven decades. They competed against each other but joined hands to fight autocratic forces towards establishing democracy. They have done hundreds of progressive things in society. Their major fault is that they have multiple entry points but no exit policy. The only exit way is the death of the leaders. This has caused unhealthy practices and created dissident groups.The dissidents who didn’t get any space within their party formed new outfits. They also amplified negative narratives against the old parties. It happened with the Congress, the UML and the Maoist Centre. Had there been an exit system in the party, the situation wouldn’t be this bad. But new political parties can’t sustain without their own political ideology and orientation. You may form an organisation, cash in on people’s frustration and achieve some immediate gains, but outfits can’t sustain.But recent electoral trends show that Nepalis are seeking alternative forces and new faces. Can we be oblivious to that?You are right. We have seen such trends in the Panchayat system as well. But garnering votes during elections for one term and establishing a sustainable political force are two different things.  \nThe CPN (Maoist Centre) has either led or been a part of the government for most of the past decade and half. But the most recent Maoist Centre-led government under Pushpa Kamal Dahal was ousted only last month. Following this, the party’s senior leaders are in marathon meetings. The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal asked Giriraj Mani Pokharel, the Maoist Centre deputy general secretary, on the party’s review of the turn of events and its future strategy. The Maoist Centre is now out of the government. How does the party intend to go forward? We have started a series of party meetings to review the overall situation and to set the party’s agenda. We held a meeting of the office bearers that ran for five days. Now the party’s standing committee meeting is underway. After this, there will be a central committee meeting. That will take the final decisions on the party’s strategy and programmes for the coming days. In the meetings, the party chair has asked the leaders to discuss national as well as party issues frankly and honestly. At the end of the meeting, we will make an objective analysis of the overall situation and prepare an action plan.The Central Committee endorses the decisions. But the meetings of the office bearers and standing committee set the agenda and orientation for the party. What have you decided so far? On the national front, obviously, the dissolution of our government and formation of a new alliance is an issue. Leaders of the new coalition have said their alliance is for making changes in the constitution. They however are still not transparent. Based on their statements, it can be said that they are going against their own pledges. During the election campaign, they had said nothing about changing the constitution. You don’t find it in their manifestos as well. But in the middle of this five-year tenure, they have come up with a new agenda. A question arises: Can they change the constitution? Doesn’t that violate the mandate the parties got through the elections? Generally, the constitution might be reviewed after 10 years of its implementation. But we haven’t implemented it in a full-fledged way as we don’t even have all the laws required for its effective implementation. We have just agreed to conclude the remaining tasks of the peace process. So, the proposal to amend the constitution without first completing the basics required for its implementation is wrong. They want to make changes in the proportional inclusive system of our constitution. A political force can work to secure a majority in the House through general elections and ensure stability in the country. We accept that. We have also been lobbying for a directly elected executive president for political stability. They are not ready to debate on that. But they want to revoke the inclusive system, a major achievement of the 2006 people’s movement. This system has empowered historically excluded and deprived communities. We have to enhance the capacity of these groups instead of depriving them of their rights. If there are anomalies in the system’s implementation, let’s develop methods to more effectively pick our representatives. But the ruling parties seem intent on turning back the clock. Some leaders have publicly announced that they want to end the role of small parties. There can be a number of political parties in a country like Nepal, which is rich in social diversity. We adopted federalism for the same purpose. The leaders give priority to their family members and loyal ones while selecting election candidates and blame the constitution for the ensuing mistakes. They want to rule the country indefinitely through a two-party system. So we think the Congress-UML alliance is on the path of regression. Republicanism, federalism, secularism, inclusion and socialism-oriented systems are integrated five pillars of the present constitution. No attack on them will be tolerated. This is one focus of our ongoing meeting. We are also discussing some fresh international issues such as the developments in Bangladesh. We have yet to get a complete picture from there. But we can still learn some things. The centre of global affairs is changing and shifting to Asia. More importantly, there is a strong influence of such geopolitical forces in Nepal as well.Party chair Pushpa Kamal Dahal has said that there was an external hand in the recent change of coalition.External elements are active, in one way or the other. Some want to make our country a playground of external forces but our party and party chair firmly stood against it. The forces that wanted various things but didn’t get them from the government then started searching for a character suitable for them. People aren’t aware of such unseen elements but we should be careful. In the meeting, we are discussing this issue as well.Do you think geopolitics is the major reason for the ouster of the Dahal-led government?In his third term as a prime minister, Prachanda was working with certain priorities such as good governance, social justice and prosperity. He had taken governance seriously. Previously, there was a practice of exploiting state coffers in collusion between politicians, big businessmen and bureaucrats. The Prachanda-led government strongly stood against such a nexus. Actions against those involved in Bhutanese refugee scam, Lalita Niwas land grab, Bansbari Leather Shoe land scam, and gold smuggling are some examples. The government formulated a law to address the problems of loan shark victims. But some individuals associated with the coalition partners were involved in the scams. Were these bad elements linked to the Congress or the UML? Dahal entered into coalitions with both.The individuals were linked to partners in both the coalitions. The party chair made good governance his main priority but the Maoist Centre is the third-largest party so his hands were tied. When certain individuals were brought under investigation in corruption cases, the initiatives to change the government were expedited overnight. We can conclude that Prachanda government’s anti-corruption moves inspired other parties to oust it.You mentioned external interference as well as other parties’ fear of the government’s anti-corruption actions. Which one was the major reason for government change?The government’s anti-corruption drive is the main reason behind the formation of the new coalition. This drive brought the two largest parties together to form a government, which is unusual in the parliamentary system. The government is working to increase the threshold to secure seats under the proportional representation category. The proposed provision is against small parties, and the Maoist Centre has opposed this. Do you see the possibility of polarisation among the parties on this issue?When the ruling parties introduce new proposals that were not even discussed during the elections, we will definitely oppose them. We led the previous movements for people’s rights and we have to secure these rights. Thus the polarisation between those who want to trample on the statute and those who are against such attacks is inevitable. Is the Maoist Centre preparing to unify with other parties including the Nepal Communist Party led by Netra Bikram Chand Biplab?First, we are in the final stage of merging with the outfit of Mahindra Raya Yadav. Also, the Biplab-led party has endorsed the party unity proposal. We have to iron out some theoretical issues and make the party line clear in the changed national as well as international context. Dialogue between us is headed in the right direction.You earlier said party chair has urged other leaders to openly debate issues. Have they discussed why the Maoist party has lost its strength as well as the issue of the party chair holding leadership continuously for three and a half decades.Comrade Prachanda led the decade-long people’s war and subsequent political movements as well as the peace process, all of which made epochal changes in Nepal’s political history. No one can deny this. Therefore, Prachanda doesn’t need any position in the party. He is now a nationally as well as internationally established personality. But our party as well as the country needs him. Therefore, the discussions in the party are now aimed at making the best use of his personality in the larger interest of the society. As far as the reasons behind the setbacks we faced in the recent time are concerned, we had rightly assessed the situation in the past.But we couldn’t adapt to the changed context. We failed to develop our culture and lifestyle in line with our guiding ideology. Similarly, we failed to run the party in a proper way. We gave up our agendas and became power-centric. We developed anti-proletariat tendencies. We were gradually distanced from the public. Now we have decided that we must reestablish our relations with the working class and the oppressed. We have also failed to communicate about the important works we did when we were in the government. We need to tell the people what we did in their favour when we were in government in the past 15 years. There will also be some serious soul-searching.There is a perception that the Maoist Centre and its leaders are incapable of staying out of power.Our party’s general convention had decided to maintain a right balance in the party’s role in the government, Parliament and the street. It is true that we were in the past more engaged in the government. The party chair has already said that our focus won’t be the government from now on. \nAjaya Dixit’s current work focuses on studying challenges of building resilience across boundaries and at sub-national scales. He has studied and written extensively on water resources, trans-boundary water cooperation, flood management, wash services and climate change adaptation, clean energy transition and related policy studies. In this interview with the Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal, Dixit discusses river management in Nepal’s urban areas: Where have we gone wrong in this endeavour and what can we do? You have extensively studied river systems and have been following changes seen in river basins. How do you see recent problems caused by encroachment and rampant development activities?We humans have lived and have to continue to live within water cycles: water evaporates from the ocean to the sky and then precipitates to the land and flows via rivers back to the ocean. Rivers that function as arteries of the land surface, sustaining humans, aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems face widespread abuses: pollution, rampant extraction of their bed and banks, fragmentation and degradation. Without rivers, we would not be who we are. Unfortunately, we have forgotten this essence. We neglect and abuse rivers. In 1981, just after the monsoon ended, I, along with my students, walked from Sundarijal to Teku studying Bagmati rivers’ sediment. At many places, we walked on the riverbed. The river then was clean. Gradually, the river systems began to face all-round decay. I have read painful accounts of my contemporaries who remember swimming in the clean Bagmati and its tributaries. In less than 50 years, our rivers in Kathmandu Valley and other basins no longer look like rivers. I feel helpless and ache with pain at this collective failure! What state of rivers are we passing on to our next generation?River encroachment is common across Nepal but more serious in urban areas, including in Kathmandu. How can this be stopped?Our approach to rivers is an imitation of the trend common across South Asia, or the subcontinent, which is again largely based on the knowledge system developed in the industrialised Global North without contextualising locally. The region features waterscapes of high and punctuated rainfall during the monsoon months, rivers, wetlands, ponds, and springs, all connected with groundwater aquifers in one of the most complex landscapes of the world: the Himalaya-Ganga region. Yet, current development endeavours subjugate water rather than respect and live with it. In 2022, the Indus River in Pakistan faced major floods with devastating consequences. Referring to these floods, a group of global scientists stated that “the impacts [of the floods] were the outcome of an outdated river management system.” This approach is primarily based on building of physical structures such as buildings, bridges and roads close to rivers interfering with their natural flows. The approach that began in the early twentieth century keeps marching on even while we are facing twenty first century water challenges.There is an increasing trend of building corridor roads along the rivers in Kathmandu as well as other places. Is this a good or bad practice? In Nepal, road building in the hills has earned the sobriquet of “dozer roads,” meaning politically designed roads excavated by heavy machine operators without adhering to basic engineering, social, environmental, or hydrological safeguards. Even highways built with “engineering,” such as the Mugling-Narayanghat section, face regular accidents. The sliding of the two buses in the Trishuli is the recent example. Building roads along the banks of rivers, defined as “river corridors,” is the preferred approach for improving connectivity. In the Kathmandu Valley, this is also associated with rivers shackled within concrete walls in the name of river beautification. In the monsoon, however, they all overflow as we have been seeing in the last few years and this year as well.What will happen to these rivers 10-15 years down the line? Is there any chance of some of our rivers dying? Or, will the measures taken in recent times protect them?All rivers must flow clean and free in selected stretches. But today, rivers are disconnected with their floodplains. Within walls and embankments, they have become conduits of filth. Many rivers are already seriously degraded. If the current trend continues, many rivers may die. I remember Jacques-Yves Cousteau, the French oceanographer, filmmaker, and author, who wrote: “Water and air, the two essential fluids on which all life depends, have become global garbage cans.” Our current efforts at conserving, developing and managing rivers are grossly inadequate. During the Covid-19 pandemic, we saw some rivers heal as human actions across the board ceased due to the lockdown. But this healing came at huge human and economic costs. The lessons, however, are clear. We must stop turning rivers into garbage cans for them to begin to heal. The onus lies on us, our activities, our governance, and the policies we make and put into practice effectively. We need new ways of imagining rivers in harmony with human needs. Otherwise, the rivers will die. If rivers die, what will become of us?What problems may city dwellers face as a result of this continued destruction of rivers?A 2020 analysis of rivers in Nepal found that the quality of rivers in the mid-hills and the Tarai are already deteriorating. Industries, cities, towns, and agriculture produce waste that, when disposed of in rivers untreated, cause pollution. Solid and liquid wastes produced by expanding cities and towns pollute nearby rivers, streams, and water bodies. Pollution kills aquatic life such as fish, which are sources of livelihood for many communities. Polluted rivers and water bodies degrade human and environmental health, leading to negative impacts on human livelihoods. The impacts of pollution on rivers are considerable during non-monsoon months when river discharge, and consequently the capacity of rivers to dilute waste, are low.What should be done to conserve the rivers, at least in the present form, and stop further damages?All rivers are a combination of water (W), energy (E), biodiversity aquatic (B), and sediment (S), represented by the acronym WEBS. In the current scheme of things, the focus is on water and energy. Aquatic ecosystems are the concern of only those working on freshwater ecosystems. They are neglected in the larger context though the state has made some provisions for conserving ecosystems. In Nepal’s Hydropower Development Policy of 2001 all hydropower plants must release 10 percent minimum flow to the downstream reaches to enable fish and other aquatic life to survive in the river. A 2021 study of 50 hydropower plants however found that none of the plants surveyed release environmental-flows. All hydropower plants, as per their power purchasing agreements, are required to produce maximum power during the dry season. We should start by accepting the fact that rivers need clean flowing water and respecting the policies we have made. Then we must systematically introduce changes and avoid the oversights embedded in the present approach. The present approach to water development and management focused on engineering and structural solutions is based on single-disciplinary education that is blind to gender and social inclusion challenges and aquatic ecosystems. In the present approach, nobody seems to want sediment which is a natural consequence of flow within the water cycle.To meet such an objective, we need to begin with a system of integrated knowledge that synthesises natural science, social science, and indigenous practices. By incorporating fields such as hydrology, ecology, social science-supported context-specific engineering, and indigenous knowledge and practices, we can take a comprehensive approach to water management challenges and solutions. Interdisciplinary approaches can build collaboration, innovation, and systemic decision-making and promote innovative water management for the benefit of both ecosystems and human societies.Do you think initiatives such as river clean up campaigns run by various groups help protect these waterways?I see such initiatives as manifestation of dissatisfaction of concerned citizens with the degradation of rivers and to bring about changes. In 1990, I was part of the Save Bagmati Campaign, which aimed to highlight the degrading state of the river. This campaign has taken many new forms, and citizen groups have begun campaigns in other rivers of Nepal. They however remain fragmented and ad-hoc. Similar campaigns in some countries have led to granting rights to rivers. In 2017, New Zealand recognised the Whanganui River and its tributaries as legal entities, acknowledging their physical and spiritual significance as “living and indivisible” and ensuring their survival, health, and integrity to balance the needs of humans and nature. Promulgations like Living Indus (Pakistan), Namami Gange river-improvement programme (India) can offer lessons for a holistic water journey. The collective voice of concerned citizens for the integrity of rivers can be a powerful medium for policy and pathway changes. Nepal must also begin country-wide river restoration initiatives. We need more dialogue and conversation around water challenges and solutions.As cities turn into concrete jungles, their water tables are said to be receding alarmingly. You often propose redesigning our settlements and development infrastructure in a way that wouldn’t disturb rivers’ natural courses and catchment areas. Could you elaborate?South Asia is a region of waterscapes containing streams, ponds, wetlands, open spaces, floodplains, springs, and underground aquifers. Yet, our towns, cities, and infrastructure are planned, designed, and built to disregard water rather than live with it. As land-centric urban growth dominates, waterscapes temporarily seem to vanish but later water comes back. In Nepali we have a saying “In twelve years a stream returns”. The present practice of urban development is obsessed with concretisation, making these areas impermeable. Rainwater, part of which would naturally infiltrate the ground, now immediately reaches the rivers already constrained by walls. The river at a downstream section immediately peaks and when the rainfall stops the river has very low discharge. Basic parameters, like the intensity of rainfall (mm per hour), are poorly recognised and used in design guidelines. The interaction of current urbanisation practices and increasing extreme rainfall, temperature and humidity rise spawned by climate change and urban heat island effects will make our urban areas as crucible of hazards, and unhealthy. A new urban future must harmoniously integrate nature, including water bodies and wetlands, and preserve natural land cover, including traditional ponds to promote groundwater recharge. It can be further achieved by preserving green open spaces, forests, gardens, permeable “sponge” pavements, and natural waterfronts for healthier communities in sustainable cities. The starting point will be recognising cities as waterscapes. Amplified mitigation of emissions of greenhouse gases at global levels remains a critical imperative in this new future. The major impacts of climate change are evident through the water cycle. Squatters settled along the riverbanks are taken as one of the major headaches in preserving rivers’ catchment areas. How can this issue be resolved?The squatters and migrants to urban regions are outcomes of the present-day political economy of development. People move to cities seeking livelihood, education, and opportunities to move up the social ladder. These groups who end up living in high-risk areas are sometimes also seen as political vote banks. This issue needs to be viewed within the larger development question including generation of local employment, new livelihood opportunities and addressing insecurities of water, food, health, and education.Recently the Supreme Court asked authorities to make septic tank and soak pit mandatory while approving building designs in order to help recharge groundwater, and a recent Cabinet meeting has banned building any structure within 40 metres on both sides of major rivers in Kathmandu, Do such measures help keep the rivers alive or is that too little too late?Such decisions, in some way, seem to underscore the notion of giving space to rivers and maintaining their integrity. Building of septic tanks as part and parcel of new houses began in the 1970s as primary treatment units that can prevent the direct dumping of human waste into rivers and water bodies. The regular cleaning and safe disposal of waste from septic tanks are emerging questions. Rivers and waterscapes face much deeper challenges, however. The present water development model marches on like a mighty tusker, trampling in its path communities, villagers, residents, natural ecosystems, the terrestrial and aquatic beings, and past memories. Turning that around will require those working on water and river integrity across geographical, social, disciplinary and political boundaries to join hands in seeking changes and laying the foundation for a new ethical social contract for rivers and waterscapes as a first step in that long journey. \nWithin days of CPN-UML chair KP Sharma Oli and Nepali Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba reaching a deal to form a new government under Oli’s leadership, some Congress leaders including the two party general secretaries started doubting the deal’s implementation. Independent observers also have doubts over the longevity of the Congress-UML partnership. To get some insight, the Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal sat down with Congress Central Committee member Govind Raj Pokharel, who is also former vice-chair of National Planning Commission. Many have expressed doubt over the longevity of the Congress-UML alliance. What is your observation?There was a discussion in the political circles on the need for the Congress and the UML joining hands to address some serious problems the country has been facing for years. The issues of governance, flaws seen in the practice of the electoral system, and the national economy are some pressing issues that need to be addressed. In the meantime, the top leaders of the two largest parties reached a deal overnight. The dramatic turn of events made people suspect some unspoken reasons had brought the leaders of the two rival forces together. The leaders have stated that they joined hands mainly to review the constitution, to make changes in the electoral system, improve governance and address problems seen in the economic sector. These are the stated objectives. As far as my observation goes, people don’t have full faith in the leaders of the two parties because of past records. On the economic front, this coalition may achieve some improvements because both parties are on the same page. Both follow liberal economic ideas. Of late, even the UML has become increasingly liberal on economic issues. The private sector has welcomed the new alliance. There are already some signs of reforms. Their plan to make changes in the electoral system through constitutional amendment however is not easy. First, their numerical strength in the federal parliament, mainly in the upper house, is insufficient to amend the constitution. Such a move would be risky from a strategic perspective as well. Many groups and forces have reservations over various provisions of this constitution. Once they start the amendment process, it will be like opening Pandora’s Box. Thus I am optimistic only on the economic front. If they get that right, it will help address the society’s mass frustration.The two parties have cited the perennial political instability as a major reason behind their coming together. Can we now expect policy consistency as well?Political instability is an excuse to cover up their failures. Even the alliance of largest parties cannot guarantee political or policy stability. Numbers alone are not enough. Leaders also need to have a democratic culture and the capacity to manage emerging issues. Even governments led by a single party commanding up to two-thirds majority have failed. On certain occasions, coalition governments have done commendable jobs. Handling the post-quake situation and producing the constitution in 2015 were examples of big parties justifying their coalition. Thus even with some doubt, we can expect political stability and some economic reforms.The Congress unanimously endorsed the deal of party president Sher Bahadur Deuba and CPN-UML chair KP Sharma Oli. But in public, leaders from the anti-establishment faction of the Congress don’t seem satisfied. Why this unease?The deal was made in a dramatic way without proper consultations with other leaders. At least those in the executive committees of the party should have been consulted. It is challenging for the Congress leaders to ally with their major rival, the UML. A cadre-based party, the UML’s style of governance is different to that of the Congress. When in government, the UML treats even government institutions, constitutional bodies and independent agencies as the party’s structures. Whereas the Congress allows more freedom to government agencies. So, there is a risk of the UML misusing state mechanisms while the Congress leaders are in the Cabinet. This is one big risk for the Congress. The second concern is the working style of Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli. He is a towering personality, a hard-working leader, and with his strong command over his party organisation, he can swiftly implement any proposal. The Congress ministers who also have to listen to the concerns of the party’s top leaders may struggle to strike a balance. In Oli’s Cabinet, ministers are likely to get less freedom within their ministries. A rift is thus likely because of Prime Minister Oli’s working style.Why didn’t the Congress then send influential leaders to the Cabinet to check the prime minister?The leaders might not have been so interested in joining this government. They might have sensed intervention from the prime minister’s office and thought they might not be able to perform as per their expectation under Oli’s leadership. See, chiefs of the Congress, the UML and the Maoist Centre work in a dictatorial way. Once they are elected at the party convention for four years, they behave like dictators. They take decisions on their own without any consultations. People in Nepal often lobby for a directly-elected prime minister or President. I wonder what these leaders would do if they were directly elected as executive head. So, the problem is in the working style and attitude of our leaders, not in the constitution or the electoral system.Shekhar Koirala and Gagan Thapa had first pitched for joining hands with the UML to end ‘unnecessary bargaining’ of fringe parties. Suddenly, Deuba struck the deal with Oli. And, now Koirala and Thapa seem sceptical about the deal.The proposal of Koirala and Thapa was for Congress leading the government and the UML supporting it. In fact, Oli was ready to accept Congress leadership. He requested the Congress leaders to take the lead. Surprisingly, the negotiating team led by our party president reached an opposite deal. They offered government leadership to Oli.Then, could it be that, as some claim, Deuba and his wife Arzu were desperate to unseat Dahal fearing they could be dragged into corruption scams?I don’t know much about that scenario. But what I knew is that Oli was willing to join a Congress-led government.Why would Deuba, who is a very clever leader in making such give-and-take deals, have given up a chance to be prime minister right away?It’s true that all three party chiefs—Deuba, Oli and Dahal—are very clever in making deals in their own favour based on their numerical strength. A leader beats the other two on one occasion and on another, another of them comes out on top. It’s like a see-saw. This time Oli won the game.Congress General Secretaries Gagan Thapa and Bishwa Prakash Sharma have expressed suspicion over the implementation of the deal. Many say they did so as Deuba didn’t involve them in negotiations on power-sharing. Is it true?The party’s central work execution committee endorsed the deal signed by the two leaders. The leaders who participate in such meetings should speak up then and there if there is anything objectionable, instead of making such statements in public. Why didn’t they oppose it at the meeting? I don’t see any point in expressing doubt over the deal in public while endorsing the same in party committees.The two general secretaries also expressed doubt over Oli handing over government leadership to Deuba as per the agreement. Why this mistrust?The experience of the past two or three decades makes politicians suspicious of each other. Nepali politicians have hardly ever handed over government leadership easily. After four or five months of collaboration, some issues emerge and a rift is created. So, history makes us doubt that this coalition will last for three and half years. In the meantime, the party establishments have sidelined other factions when it comes to picking ministers, both at federal and provincial levels. When the government fails to perform as per expectation, party cadres of the ruling parties start criticising the government. Is it possible to amend the constitution as the two parties have announced?We can’t backtrack on the inclusive system. We must abide by the policy of inclusion in state agencies. The leaders who spoiled this system are saying that the proportional representation (PR) system is not working. But there is room to make our three-tier federal system more cost-effective. People get irritated when they see a large number of representatives benefitting from state coffers. We can bring down the number of local units from 753 to around 400. However, there should be sufficient wards as those units are directly involved in service delivery while the Palikas are more engaged in development activities. The number of ward members can also be decreased. In provinces, we don’t need PR seats as those elected from the provincial constituencies automatically represent the local communities. Likewise, the provincial cabinets can be downsized. Thus we can downsize the number of people who benefit from state coffers. This is vital to make the federal system sustainable. Similarly, we can rightsize the number of PR seats by adopting a rotational constituency for women, dalits and other marginalised communities. Only the candidates from underrepresented sections will compete in those constituencies. This will help elect competent people even from within the targeted communities. This is how we can address some concerns without compromising the inclusive system envisioned in the constitution.Why has the Congress picked gangsters and tainted individuals as ministers in provinces?The selection of such controversial individuals as ministers and policy makers will damage the party’s image. People are going to raise this issue seriously. In fact the pace of criminalisation and commercialisation of Nepali politics is faster than the political reform being undertaken to clean up politics.It seems intellectual leaders are being sidelined while gangsters are being promoted. Why is it happening?Because people from intellectual or political backgrounds voice critical views and leaders don’t like it. They speak what their conscience says is right. For instance, leaders like Mahesh Acharya and Minendra Rijal aren’t given any role in the party. It is a common problem in all the major political forces in Nepal.Is the space for leaders with intellectual backgrounds and having critical views being squeezed?The Congress used to be a very liberal organisation. But it has also become illiberal and leaders have become increasingly intolerant. All leaders—whether the seniors or young ones—are becoming less tolerant even of constructive criticism. Party leaders haven’t spoken against the selection of gangsters as ministers. Even the office bearers who are in decision making bodies and can change the decisions are silent now. This is dangerous. This is an example of how critical voices are sidelined.Haven’t the two young general secretaries been able to raise hope in the Congress?They are working like central committee members. General secretaries should be able to intervene while making crucial policy decisions. They can stop the party committees from making wrong decisions. But they are risk-averse. They are not taking the risk to fight the powerful party establishment.Historically, in all parties there is a trend of its anti-establishment faction bargaining for 40-45 percent seats in the party or government. If they don’t get an acceptable power sharing deal, they don’t cooperate with the party leadership. Is it a healthy democratic practice?Intra-party competition compels the leaders to do this. The ruthless establishment always sidelines party members and leaders if they aren’t loyal. So, the leadership of the anti-establishment has to protect such cadres because the rival factor too needs a strong support base of cadres to compete against the powerful establishment. Party establishments are strong due to centralised resources and other factors, so you need an equally strong force to compete against them. \nThe Meteorological Forecasting Division has predicted partly to generally cloudy conditions across Nepal on Monday, with light to moderate rain accompanied by thunder and lightning likely in a few places across all provinces.
