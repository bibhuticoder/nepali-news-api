Write it in the form of inspiring story not news article or event.\n    \n    Story:\nOnce upon a time, nestled between the towering peaks of the Himalayas and the lush jungles of the Terai, there was a country named Nepal. Though still a developing nation, Nepal was a land of profound beauty and deep-rooted cultural heritage. The residents of Nepal faced many challenges, but beneath these hardships lay a resilient spirit and an unyielding hope for the future.\n\nThis enchanting land, where Mount Everest reaches towards the skies and the air carries a mix of incense and cool mountain breezes, was more than a geographical marvel. It was a mosaic of cultures, languages, and traditions, a testament to human endeavor against all odds. Nepal's history, from the unification under King Prithvi Narayan Shah to its transformation into a federal democratic republic, told a story of aspiration and endurance.\n\nIn recent years, the people of Nepal, with their indomitable will, had taken strides towards rebuilding and reimagining their country. They turned their struggles into stepping stones, each challenge a chapter in their ongoing saga. The shift from a monarchy to a republic had not only changed governance but had woven a new tapestry of democratic values and collective decision-making.\n\nEconomically, while agriculture continued to sustain a large part of its population, Nepal had begun to harness the potential of its picturesque landscapes, developing sustainable tourism that promised to preserve their natural heritage while boosting local economies. Communities living in the shadows of the Himalayas had become stewards of the earth, protecting the biodiversity that made their country unique.\n\nEach day brought new stories. Whether it was a festival in Kathmandu, a technological advance in Pokhara, or a conservation effort in Chitwan, these events were threads in the vibrant quilt of Nepali life. These stories, updated daily, reflected the pulse of progress and the spirit of hope that characterized this resilient nation.\n\nAnd so, as Nepal moved forward, each moment was not just a passage of time but a promise of potential, a narrative of a nation perennially climbing towards tomorrow, guided by the legacy of its past and the dreams of its future.\n\nNews events:\nWith a bit of luck Nepal’s fairytale victory would have been secured.The country’s hopes of progressing to the Super Eight stage of the 2024 ICC Men’s T20 World Cup ended after they lost to cricketing powerhouse South Africa by one run in a nail-biting last-ball thriller in their Group D match at the Arnos Vale Ground in Kingstown, St Vincent on Saturday.But their spirited performance earned praise worldwide after almost pulling off an upset win over one of the tournament favourites.Fielding first after winning the toss, the Rhinos restricted a strong Proteas team to a subpar 115-7 with their stupendous spin attack as Dipendra Singh Airee and part-time bowler Kushal Bhurtel shared all seven wickets that fell between them on a turning track.But they fell agonisingly short from recording their historic first ever victory over an ICC’s full-member nation after they could only manage 114-7.Despite the heartbreak, Nepal’s performance caught attention worldwide.“A performance to be proud of. Keep your heads high,” world cricket governing body International Cricket Council wrote on X, formerly Twitter.South Africa legend Dale Steyn called the Nepal vs South Africa game the “Match of the Tournament” on ICC’s Digital Daily show.“It would’ve been the talk of the tournament if Nepal would’ve gotten over the line. It would’ve been fantastic, and they deserved to win,” Steyn said. “[This was] the match of the tournament to be honest with you. I saw people crying in the stands, it shows how much it means to them, and that’s what cricket is all about.”Indian cricket commentator and journalist Harsha Bhogle said Nepal have a brighter future ahead of them.“Hold your heads high Nepal. That was South Africa you almost took down today. You have some of the most passionate fans and you let them believe. Hopefully bigger days are round the corner.”Indian Premier League franchise cricket team Chennai Super Kings wrote on X: “Unreal fans support! Unreal game of unreal night! Nepal, you have won all our hearts!”“Nepal's performance—all cricketing commentators, most of the IPL franchise teams, cricketing bodies are talking about the team, talking about that fan following!” a Nepal supporter based in Australia wrote on X. “Isn't it great? Didn't we win something?”ICC and Asian Cricket Council commentator Mikkhail Vaswani wrote on his Facebook page: “Nepal are the youngest team in this World Cup. They have put on some great performances. Time to back the boys for a very strong and committed effort.”At an average age of 23.7, Nepal are the youngest team at the World Cup. The team is led by Rohit Paudel, who, at 21, is the youngest captain in the 20-team tournament, while Gulsan Jha, 18, is the youngest player.After the match, Paudel stressed that Nepal needed more exposure against the best teams of the world if they are to be on the right side of the result.“We were very close but a little far,” Paudel said after the close contest. “In crunch moments, we did well, the way we fought was very good.”He added, “If we get more exposure regularly, then next games we will be on the other side [of the result].”Nepal were a far less experienced side as they were making their only second appearance at the world stage.Chasing, the batters took Nepal to 85-2 in the 14th over in the chase, riding on 32 runs from their power play without losing a wicket and a half-century stand between opener Aasif Sheikh and Anil Sah that came off just 36 deliveries.But the introduction of spinner Tabraiz Shamsi (4-19) would prove to be lethal in Nepal’s chase.Shamsi first dismissed Bhurtel for 13 with his only second delivery in the eighth over and Paudel for a duck two balls later to hurl South Africa back in the game.Sheikh and Sah rebuilt the Nepal innings.Sah hit three boundaries off Anrich Nortje and a six off Shamshi to raise the tempo before Sheikh smashed Kagiso Rabada for a four and a six that took Nepal past 80 total after 13 overs with still eight wickets in hand.After Sah fell to Aiden Markram (1-8) making 27 runs off 24 balls, Sheikh and Airee dragged Nepal to 98-3 from 17 overs.But Shamshi returned with the ball in the 18th over and mercilessly raided the stumps of Airee and dangerman Sheikh to turn the game back into South Africa’s favour. Sheikh finished his innings with 42 runs off 49 balls.Nepal needed 16 runs off the last 12 balls but Nortje (1-27) and Ottneil Baartman held their nerves in the final two overs to save the Proteas from the jaws of defeat.Nortje bowled four dots in the penultimate over including a wicket of Kushal Malla that left Nepal requiring 16 runs off the last eight balls.Sompal Kami hit Nortje with a long six and collected two runs off the last ball of the 19th over that brought the equation down to eight off the final six deliveries. Gulsan Jha next cracked a four off Baartman in the 19.3 overs and managed another two off the next delivery to inch Nepal closer to overhauling the target.Nepal only needed two runs off the last two deliveries to keep alive their hopes of reaching the Super Eight but Baartman threw two dots with perfect bouncers to break Nepali hearts.Gulsan Jha tried to take the game to Super Over with a desperate attempt to add a run off a bye of the final delivery but Quinton de Kock and Heinrich Klaasen combined to run him out at the non-striker’s end.Earlier, Bhurtel took 4-19 and Airee bowled 3-21 to trouble South Africa throughout the innings.South Africa added 22 runs for the first wicket before Airee got the breakthrough wicket when he caught and bowled de Kock for 10 in the fourth over.Bhurtel then bowled captain Markram for 15 in the 12th over, ending their 46-run stand for the second wicket.South Africa seemed headed for a good total when they were at 68-2 in the 12th over but Bhurtel’s wrist spin and Airee’s off break kept their powerful opponents under control.Bhurtel removed Klaasen for three before Airee got the big fish Hendricks, who top scored for South Africa with 43 runs off 49 balls, and removed David Miller for seven the next.South Africa needed sixth number batter Tristan Stubbs’s 27 not out off 18 balls for a boost to their innings.Bhurtel then underlined Nepal’s impressive bowling, claiming the wickets of Marco Jansen (1) and Rabada (0) in successive deliveries off the final two balls.Sandeep Lamichhane also started for the first time after missing Nepal’s matches in the United States due to visa issues and bowled splendidly conceding only 18 runs in his four-over spell.“I am very proud of the unit, especially the way we bowled and batted, I'm very proud of that,” Paudel said.South Africa skipper Markram was also full of praise for Nepal’s bowling.“First and foremost, the way [Nepal] bowled it made it really tough for us. They put us under a lot of pressure,” Markram said.The defeat leaves Nepal fourth in the five-team group D with one point, which they earned after rain washed out their second group match against Sri Lanka. Nepal had lost their opening game to the Netherlands by six wickets.South Africa, who had already progressed to the Super Eight round, finished the group stage unbeaten, collecting eight points from four matches.Nepal next face Bangladesh on Monday and will look to end their T20 World Cup campaign on a high note.Bangladesh are second with four points from three matches and a victory over Nepal would secure them a spot in the next round.The Netherlands, on two points, are also in contention and next face Sri Lanka who are also without a win and lie at the bottom of the group. \nNepal’s unemployment rate has been increasing, according to a report.The fourth Nepal Living Standard Survey report, published by the National Statistics Office on Thursday, shows that the unemployment rate climbed up to 12.6 percent in 2022-23 from 11.4 percent in 2017-18, representing a 1.2 percent rise in the five-year period.The unemployment rate has risen from 4.9 percent in 1995-96 to 12.6 percent in 2022-23.This rise is more pronounced among younger workers, with the unemployment rate for those aged 15-24 jumping from 7.3 percent in 1995-96 to 22.7 percent in 2022-23. The report said this highlights the challenge of finding jobs for youths in Nepal. The survey report shows joblessness among people between the ages of 15 and 24 declined to 22.7 percent in 2022-23 from 23.9 percent in 2017-18.“Most worrying is the rise in unemployment in the past five years, which increased by 1.2 percent, and that’s worrisome,” said Hem Raj Regmi, deputy chief statistician at the statistics office. “The economy has failed to generate enough jobs for its large and expanding young population.”The population structure has shifted towards a younger working-age population, with a decrease in the proportion of children (0-14 years) and an increase in the proportion of adults (15-59 years).This trend is further supported by a declining dependency ratio, suggesting a growing workforce. The proportion of the elderly population (60 years and above) has increased.Regmi said the age between 15 and 24, the most productive time for an individual, is not considered the working age in Nepal, as these people are involved in education and training.“At this age, our survey has found, people will work only if they are offered a job. The responsibility to earn money grows in later years.”The survey data on employment status reveals significant shifts in the labour market between 1995-96 and 2022-23. The percentage of those with jobs has declined considerably from 67.2 percent in 1995-96 to 32.4 percent in 2022-23, while the percentage of those not in the labour force has increased from 29.4 percent to 62.9 percent.The share of wage employment in agriculture has significantly declined from 70.7 percent in 1995-96 to 1.9 percent in 2022-23. The share of wage employment in non-agriculture, on the other hand, has risen considerably from 9.5 percent in 1995-96 to 56.6 percent in 2022-23.The survey report shows that 32.4 percent of the population is employed, 62.9 percent is not in the labour force, and 4.7 percent is unemployed.The labour force participation rate came down to 37.1 percent in 2022-23 from 38.2 percent five years ago.“The employment condition in Nepal is the worst,” said economist Pushkar Bajracharya. “The government failed to create jobs. This is because the investment environment has not been favourable in past years, mainly due to political and policy uncertainty. When there is no investment, there is no job creation.”Bajracharya said the unemployment rate would further jump due to the repercussions of the Covid-19 pandemic and the recession and slowdown the country has seen.“Many industries, service sectors and companies are still laying off workers due to the economic slowdown. There is low demand for labour in the country as the key economic sectors—construction and manufacturing—are facing recession, while wholesale and retail have shown a slight recovery,” said Bajracharya. Experts say that while the overall unemployment rate is low, the jobs being created in Nepal’s economy are not of quality. There is a need for new strategies, new partners, and new goals.Each year, around a million Nepali youths, including students, leave the country to try their luck abroad.The survey data on remittances and transfers reveals a significant increase in the prevalence and magnitude of remittances received by households in Nepal between 1995-96 and 2022-23.The percentage of households receiving remittances has increased dramatically from 23.4 percent in 1995-96 to 76.8 percent in 2022-23, indicating a significant rise in the number of Nepali families relying on the money sent by their members working abroad.This increase is consistent with the observed growth in average remittances per household, which has significantly increased from Rs15,160 in 1995-96 to Rs145,093 in 2022-23.Remittances (other than from India) are quite dominant, highlighting the importance of international migration for income generation.Remittances from India declined from 32.9 percent in 1995-96 to 11.1 percent in 2010-11, but they have increased since, reaching 21.3 percent in 2022-23, according to the survey report.The survey data on household loans shows that the percentage of families borrowing money is relatively stable (61.3 percent in 1995-96 and 63.8 percent in 2022-23). However, the percentage of households with outstanding loans has significantly increased, from 58.4 percent in 1995-96 to 97.3 percent in 2022-23.The data also reveals a shift in the sources of household loans. Traditional money lenders were previously a dominant source (39.7 percent in 1995-96), but their share significantly decreased to 11.4 percent in 2022-23.The share of loans from banks has increased (from 16.1 percent in 1995-96 to 22.4 percent in 2022-23), while loans from relatives continue to remain significant (40.8 percent in 1995-96 to 42.5 percent in 2022-23).Household consumption as a reason for borrowing has been declining (from 49.4 percent in 1995-96 to 23.5 percent in 2022-23). This could be attributed to improved access to essential goods and services or a shift to other borrowing needs, the survey report shows.The use of collateral has also shifted, with an increase in the proportion of loans taken with collateral. While 16.8 percent of loans were taken with land and house collateral in 1995-96, this share increased to 35.1 percent in 2022-23.The data shows a noticeable shift in the dominant sectors of non-farm activities. While trade was previously the most prevalent sector (52.1 percent in 1995-96), it has declined (42.5 percent in 2022-23). The share of manufacturing has also decreased from 29.9 percent in 1995-96 to 22.6 percent in 2022-23.Similar is the case with the service sector enterprises, which decreased from 29.2 percent in 2003-04 to 7.2 percent in 2022-23. The percentage of registered enterprises has increased significantly from 11.7 percent in 1995-96 to 52.6 percent in 2022-23, indicating greater adherence to regulations and potentially better access to resources and support.Data on wage employment in 2022-23 provides insights into the nature of work and earnings in Nepal. The average number of daily working days for wage earners in the past year is 72.Daily wage jobs keep 64.9 percent of people busy. This suggests a need for more secure and stable employment opportunities for most of the workforce. While long-term jobs with monthly salaries account for 28.7 percent, contract-based work constitutes only 6.4 percent.According to the survey, nominal income levels in Nepal increased substantially from 1995-96 to 2022-23. The average household income increased more than twelvefold, from Rs43,732 in 1995-96 to Rs551,148 in 2022-23.Similarly, the average per capita income rose significantly from Rs7,690 to Rs136,707 over the period. This growth was uneven across income groups: the per capita income of the poorest 20 percent of the population grew from Rs2,020 to Rs61,335, while that of the wealthiest 20 percent surged from Rs19,325 to Rs259,867.The composition of household income also shifted markedly, with the share of farm income dropping from 61 percent in 1995-96 to 16.8 percent in 2022-23, reflecting a transition to non-farm and other income sources. Remittances make up an important share of this income.The survey also shows a shift in cropping patterns—the percentage of land holdings growing paddy has decreased from 76 percent in 1995-96 to 64.3 percent in 2022-23. The percentage of holdings growing summer vegetables has increased from 35.6 in 1995-96 to 39.3 in 2022-23. Likewise, the percentage of holdings with cattle has declined significantly from 73.5 in 1995-96 to 37.8 in 2022-23.The literacy rate for the population aged 5 years and above has substantially increased (from 37.8 percent in 1995-96 to 77.4 percent in 2022-23). This positive trend is also visible in the adult literacy rate (15 years and above), which has risen (from 35.6 percent in 1995-96 to 72.5 percent in 2022-23), highlighting significant progress in literacy among the adult population.This improvement is more noticeable among males, with the literacy rate increasing from 53.5 percent in 1995-96 to 82.9 percent in 2022-23. For the females, the increase is from 19.4 percent in 1995-96 to 64.1 percent in 2022-23.The data also shows a significant increase in school attendance among the population aged 15 years and above, with 33.9 percent having attended school in 1995-96 compared to 70.2 percent in 2022-23.This trend is again more noticeable among males, with school attendance increasing from 50.2 percent in 1995-96 to 81.4 percent in 2022-23. For females, attendance increased from 19.1 percent in 1995-96 to 61.1 percent in 2022-23.The survey data on health services paints a mixed picture of health status and access to healthcare in Nepal between 1995-96 and 2022-23. The population reporting chronic illnesses grew from 6.5 percent in 1995-96 to 18.5 percent in 2022-23, indicating a potential rise in non-communicable diseases.There has also been a significant increase in the percentage reporting acute illnesses—from 9 percent in 1995-96 to 24.9 percent in 2022-23, suggesting a potential shift in disease patterns or reporting practices. A decline is observed in diarrhoea from 17 percent in 1995-96 to 6.6 percent in 2022-23, potentially indicating improved sanitation and hygiene practices.Cold/fever remains a significant concern, increasing from 43.7 percent in 1995-96 to 51.5 percent in 2022-23. The percentage of those consulting a doctor has remained relatively stable (around 29 percent), and the percentage consulting a paramedic has significantly decreased.Migration patterns within Nepal reveal significant shifts in trends between 2003-04 and 2022-23. While the overall percentage of the migrant population within the country has remained relatively stable—36.6 percent in 2003-04 and 38.1 percent in 2022-23—there is a notable shift in the gender composition of migrants.Males constituted a higher proportion of migrants in 2003-04 (50.1 percent), but females made a larger share of the migrant population (49.6 percent) in 2022-23. A decline in the percentage of migrants from rural areas in 2022-23 indicates a potential shift in migration patterns, possibly driven by changing economic opportunities and societal factors.The analysis of reasons for migration reveals that family remains the dominant factor (75.2 percent in 2003-04 moving within the country for family reasons and 74.9 percent in 2022-23).The fourth Nepal Living Standards Survey, conducted in 2022-23, is the first such survey since the country’s transition to a federal system. Data was collected from a nationally representative sample of 9,600 households on a wide range of topics. \nCPN-UML Chairman KP Sharma Oli once again vented his ire at the budget for the new fiscal year on Saturday, fuelling speculations of growing discord among the ruling parties.On May 29, the day after Finance Minister Barsha Man Pun read out the national budget in Parliament, Oli lambasted some of the provisions and said the fiscal plan was of “one minister and one party”.Oli and his party were unhappy with some of the provisions, including the distribution of funds to the conflict victims, who mostly are CPN (Maoist Centre) members. Oli’s UML is the largest partner in the Pushpa Kamal Dahal-led coalition government.Addressing the UML parliamentary party meeting on Saturday, Oli said the budget had failed to address the concerns of the poor. “Our duty is to stop poverty and lead the country towards development. If the poor are not benefitting and development is not happening, how can we satisfy them?” Oli wondered.He also asked the party’s ministers to see the status of the ministries they lead. “We have to keep track of the budget allocated to the ministries led by the UML,” Oli said, directing the party’s lawmakers to openly discuss the budget in the party and in Parliament.He also accused the government of failing to pay enough attention to development activities. “Our party joined the government to stop poverty and advance development. If that is not happening, how can we be satisfied?” Oli said.Stating that the percentage of the poor had now increased, Oli claimed that poverty had been reduced significantly during his premiership, which lasted over three years until July 2021.A UML central committee leader told the Post that Oli has already expressed his dissatisfaction with the budget with Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal. Oli’s second instance of expressing his displeasure with the budget signals a growing misunderstanding between the two leaders, UML leaders said. Oli wants more spending in the sectors of entrepreneurship and infrastructure.He urged the UML ministers to study the budget but directed the party’s lawmakers not to comment on it on social media platforms. “It’d be better to express your concerns and comments at party meetings,” Oli told UML lawmakers.Also on Saturday, Gagan Thapa, a general secretary of the opposition Nepali Congress, raised questions about the government’s activities. The UML is in government, but the party is acting as if it is not a part of it, he said. “The UML first sent junior party leaders to the Cabinet. Now it has stopped owning up the government’s activities,” Thapa shared his observation.When the UML goes to people, it takes no responsibility for the government’s works, he said. “They are acting as though the UML was not consulted while the Maoists prepared the budget.”The party had deputed former finance minister Bishnu Poudel to provide inputs and suggestions for the budget. \nWhat’s cooking in the Rastriya Swatantra Party? Why are the leaders of the fourth-largest party in the House of Representatives and the third-largest partner in the Pushpa Kamal Dahal-led Cabinet giving statements hinting at their possible exit from the government?Some remarks made by the RSP ministers have fuelled speculation. On Saturday, Minister for Youth and Sports Biraj Bhakta Shrestha of the same party remarked that the time has come to review their participation in the government and its support to the coalition. Addressing a function organised to mark the establishment day of the RSP, he went on to say that they were ready to quit the government if needed. “We are always carrying our resignation letter in our pocket, and the paper may be pulled out any time,” he said. On Friday, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Home Affairs Lamichhane, who is also the RSP president, complained that though they were in the government, others were controlling state power in a true sense. Many wondered if Lamichhane had started getting frustrated with the government.Addressing a press briefing organised on the occasion of Lamichhane’s 100 days in the home ministry, he said, “Though we are in government, we don’t know who is exercising the state power. Power has been controlled by some others for a long time, and it is a bit difficult to break that nexus.” However, some lawmakers from the party the Post spoke to voiced ignorance of why the party’s ministers were making such remarks. The RSP put on an impressive performance at the 2022 election, capitalising on the public’s frustration with traditional parties. Minister Shrestha said they were treading a tough path and were ready to quit the government if they were coerced into making unnecessary compromises.Shrestha said that after they joined the government, they realised that the country’s misgovernance was more serious than prevailing social malpractices. In the last week of December in 2022, Dahal became prime minister for the third time with the support of the CPN-UML and the RSP, among other parties. Dahal later ditched them and joined hands with the Nepali Congress to form a new Cabinet.After 14 months, Dahal sent the Nepali Congress out of power and brought the UML and the RSP into the coalition on March 4 this year. Hundred days after the latest change in the power equation, statements from the leaders and ministers of the third-largest coalition partner have made watchers curious about their intentions. Asked what was going on inside their party, RSP lawmakers expressed their ignorance. They said they had no idea about the party’s future moves and leaders’ mood as there had not been enough meetings, discussions, and interactions recently.“We would know what is going on in the party and the government only if there were party meetings,” the lawmakers told the Post asking not to be named. “Only a select group of leaders make party’s decisions, and we are kept in the dark.” Kabindra Burlakoti, the party's deputy general secretary, however, tried to downplay Shrestha's statement as generic. He said Saturday’s statement by the minister is nothing different from the ones party leaders have been saying since joining the government. His statement does not imply that the party is seeking to recall its ministers, added Burlakoti. “Until our party has a free hand to work in the government, we are not considering withdrawing our support,” Burlakoti told the Post.Experts, however, say Lamichhane is trying to cover up his failure to deliver. The party that rose with tall promises made during the election campaign is failing to live up to its pledges. It has courted controversy in multiple cases, including the cooperative scam.“The party has a free hand in the government,” Krishna Pokharel, a professor of political science, told the Post. “I see no reason for the party to blame its coalition partners.”After the Ilam-2 by-election on April 27, RSP General Secretary Mukul Dhakal travelled to various places to study the reasons for the party’s defeat in the bypolls.During the general secretary's visit to various districts, well-wishers shared their advice that it would have been better had the party focused on organisation-building rather than joining the government, deputy general secretary Burlakoti said.“However, the party is not considering a radical move immediately,” Burlakoti added. “The advice given to our general secretary during his nationwide tour was received as feedback. The party is in no mood to quit the government.”Experts, however, say RSP leaders might be anxious about the report and recommendations of the parliamentary probe committee formed to investigate the cooperative scam. Lamichhane has been accused of embezzling millions of rupees from various cooperatives when he managed the now shuttered television Galaxy 4K.The parliamentary committee has been mandated to figure out if the cooperative money was rerouted to the Gorkha Media Network. Lamichhane was the managing director of the media company that operated the television.“Anticipating the possible outcome of the probe, the RSP could have started to bargain with ruling partners,” Jhalak Subedi, a political analyst, told the Post. “They might have tried to use the situation to win public sentiment.”But Burlakoti denied such a possibility. “We are confident that our party president won’t be implicated by the probe,’’ he said. “Then there is no question our party leaders should be bargaining with the coalition partners.” \n“Our land. Our future”. The theme for this year’s World Environment Day, emphasising land restoration, combating desertification and building resilience to drought, encompasses the pressing issues of this era which need careful intervention. The scale and intensity of the impacts of land degradation, desertification and drought are alarming. The United Nations Environment Program (UNEP) states that up to 40 percent of the world’s land is degraded, adversely impacting around 3.2 billion people. Projections also indicate that over three-quarters of the world's population by 2050 will be affected by drought. These impacts manifest in several aspects of life and nature, including loss of biodiversity and ecosystems, depletion of resources, food insecurity, livelihood and ultimate human existence. In recent times, land degradation induced by physical, chemical and biological processes has been accelerated by human activities. The main culprits include haphazard infrastructure development, industrialisation, high carbon-intensive energy use, overgrazing and excessive extraction of natural resources without consideration of environmental sustainability. Prolonged droughts are becoming more common and climate change adds uncertainty and complexities to their occurrences. Nepal’s vulnerabilityNepal’s young mountains are geologically fragile and complex. Located in a tectonically active zone, the whole land mass from the Himalayas in the North to the Siwalik in the South is susceptible to peculiar challenges, especially erosion, landslides and floods. Anthropogenic activities in this hazard-prone region, including haphazard infrastructure construction, land use change, and chemical fertiliser and pesticide overuse, exacerbate these natural phenomena. For instance, road construction on the slopes without due consideration to the environment and slope stabilisation in the last decade has increased incidents of landslides and slope failures. Excessive extraction of resources from rivers is another concern. While regulatory provisions in the Environment Protection Act and Regulation mandate comprehensive assessment, project developers often perceive such provisions as a burden. Limited focus on the implementation of the Environmental Management Plan, compliance monitoring and evaluation, and audits are the reasons behind haphazard resource extraction and the continuation of environmentally unsustainable projects.Soil loss through erosion, a serious threat to soil health, results in agricultural yield decline, ecosystem degradation, habitat destruction and several economic impacts. A 2016 study by the International Center for Integrated Mountain Development (ICIMOD) estimated 40 million tons of soil loss between 1990 and 2010 in the Koshi basin. Identification of arable soil loss areas is critical for effective land management planning focused on conservation measures. The 61st report of the Office of the Auditor General pointed out that the content of soil organic matter currently stands at 2.83 against the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) target of 3.37. Policy interventionsA 2018 report titled “Land degradation neutrality target setting program in Nepal” set three targets to be achieved by 2030: i) Increase forest cover to 44.7 percent; ii) increase agricultural growth by 6 percent; iii) increase Soil Organic Carbon in forest and cropland by 1 percent per annum and iv) restoring 10 percent of wetland ecosystem out of 26277 sq. hectares of wetlands. Among these, Nepal’s success in increasing forest cover from 39.6 percent in 1993 to 44.74 percent in 2018 is praised all over the world as one of the best-case examples of sustainable forest management initiatives. Despite this achievement, the recent episodes of forest fires during the pre-monsoon period are worrisome. The attainment of other targets requires concentrated effort by building synergies and collaboration among national policies/strategies and different climate action programmes. For instance, Land Use Policy, Agriculture Development Strategy, Nepal Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan and Climate Change Policy are required to be aligned on its objectives, strategies and programmes. At the programme level, for instance, the National Climate Change Support Programme, the National Adaptation Plan, and the President Chure Terai Madesh Conservation Programme need to focus on a collaborative approach; eliminating duplication and creating synergies among beneficiaries and outcome of this programme. Research on drought shows an increasing trend in both the intensity and frequency of drought occurrences. The impacts of drought are significantly higher in rain-fed agricultural regions like Nepal, which rely extensively on the monsoon. Droughts result in crop failures and food insecurity, which is why region-specific explorations of droughts are essential for effective drought monitoring and risk mitigation. A 2021 study indicated that summer drought events have increased fivefold in the central region, doubled in the eastern region, and not significantly changed in the western region of Nepal. These incidences have severe implications for vulnerable communities that are mostly dependent on subsentence agriculture for their livelihood. As a result, difficulty in local livelihoods prevails, which acts as a “push factor” leading to increased migration from rural to urban city centres and abroad. Soil healthHealthy soil is the foundation not only of agricultural systems and food security but also of the existence of humans. So, data management should be a priority towards understanding and analysing the pattern, trend and hotspots of land degradation and droughts. Sustainable land management programmes should incorporate soil conservation and watershed management, soil fertility management and improvement, community forestry programmes, technology development, and research and development. Climate-smart agriculture and the implementation and monitoring of environmental management plans are equally important. For these programmes to be successful, functional coordination mechanisms and institutional arrangements are pivotal. Further, opportunities to tap climate finance for implementing adaptation programmes at the local level will be crucial. But the state alone cannot address the land degradation problem; rather, collaboration among all sectors and stakeholders, including civil society, the private sector, and the general public, is essential for achieving the desired outcomes in restoring land, combating desertification and building drought resilience. \nEven in 2024, women stand a long way from accessing equal opportunities with men. The persistent gender disparities across various spheres of life—education, employment, healthcare, and beyond—are stark reminders of the structural barriers confronting women in Pakistan. Despite efforts, the nation consistently lags on gender parity indices, raising concerns about the adequacy and sufficiency of initiatives targeted at closing the gender gap. Placed 142nd out of 146 countries on the WEF’s 2023 Global Gender Gap Index, it is evident that significant strides are needed to address gender inequities in Pakistan.An examination of past budgetary allocations and policy documents unveils a persistent neglect of gender considerations, manifesting in inadequate resource allocation for women across crucial sectors. These systemic imbalances perpetuate gender inequalities, thwarting the full realisation of Pakistan’s human potential. Recent stabilisation policies have further tilted the scales against women due to discriminate access to formal capital markets, decent jobs, financial and digital tools, etc.As the new fiscal year approaches, it is imperative to remind the government of the gender issues that have only received perfunctory attention over the years. Policymakers must acknowledge that no economic recovery can be sustainable if half the country’s population is inhibited in its capacity to contribute productively, underscoring the need for gender-centric policies.While economic revival must remain a top priority, any effort towards this goal without adequate female representation is like building a house of cards. Sustainable economic recovery is contingent upon the mainstreaming of gender-centric policies across all sectors. This necessitates integrating the gendered impacts of policies into the planning process, rather than treating them as an afterthought.In this context, the federal and provincial budgets can be leveraged by respective governments to address disparities through gender-responsive budgeting. Gender Responsive Budget entails evaluating the gendered impacts of budgetary allocations, integrating gender equality in planning processes, and establishing monitoring mechanisms for greater accountability. The overarching goal is to ensure equitable distribution of resources for inclusive development.It is disconcerting that despite the widespread adoption of Gender Responsive Budget in many countries, including South Asian counterparts India and Bangladesh, Pakistan has yet to present a gender-responsive budget. As a first step, all PC-1 forms must incorporate a dedicated section obligating departments to thoroughly assess the gendered impacts of the proposed projects. Projects that help level the playing field should be prioritised over those that magnify distortions. Additionally, macroeconomic policies must only be implemented after carefully assessing their differential impacts on women.To further promote gender equity, several key demands must be addressed, including ensuring equal employment opportunities, pay equity, supporting women-owned businesses with financial incentives, and increasing funding for girls’ education, especially in underserved areas. Expanding maternal, reproductive, and mental health services, establishing affordable childcare facilities, and streng­thening laws and support services against gender-based violence are also essential, particularly in the face of climatic cha­l­lenges. Ad­­diti­o­­nally, enhancing social protection program­mes for more coverage, along with increasing digital and financial access is essential to promote equity.Greater representation of women in decision-making roles is of utmost import­ance. Currently, political representation seems confined to a few privileged women, often detached from the everyday challenges faced by the majority.This lack of representative female voices in the political arena results in the formation of ineffective policies that overlook critical gender issues. Developing mechanisms to facilitate participatory budgeting can help address this concern.The government must also prioritise data consolidation to support evidence-based policymaking. At present, the inadequate targeting of social programmes stemming from deficiencies in data undermines the effectiveness of initiatives. With limited fiscal space, the government must calibrate each and every budgetary allocation judiciously for maximised impact, for which data is key.In a nutshell, mainstreaming gender considerations across all sectors during the planning phase can enable policy-makers to significantly enhance the prospects for fairer, more inclusive economic resurgence.-Dawn (Pakistan)/ANN \nNepal is in the hands of shortsighted and irrational decision-makers. Take, for example, the recent directive by Home Minister Rabi Lamichhane to deploy traffic rule violators for traffic management. Thankfully, Lamichhane’s directive was overturned by the Supreme Court. The Kathmandu Road Division’s hasty decision to blacktop the road section the Kathmandu Metropolitan City had prepared for footpath extension is another example.It is striking how Lamichhane—a journalist-turned-politician and a former vocal critic of the ministers from parties he now aligns with—turned out no different. He is just as unscrupulous and power-hungry as the old guard, doing everything he can to remain in power and satisfy his political ambitions. Such a hunger for power leads him to make hasty and moody decisions, further augmenting the burden on the economy and society. This piece will analyse the economic cost of such decisions later, but first, let’s understand the reasons behind the pomposity of the leaders. One must understand political schooling to understand why Nepali politicians, new and old, formulate bizarre policies. What are the qualifications to become a politician, let alone a minister, in Nepal? It is anything but education and expertise. The current federal Cabinet of Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal and state and local level governments are not far from any of this. Most of them are no experts, nor do they hold the required knowledge to run their positions. The irony is that we have a government where a journalist becomes the home minister, a former rebel commander becomes the finance minister, and someone who lost the election becomes the minister of foreign affairs, home affairs, and physical infrastructure and transportation, all within a year under the same prime ministership. How can one person seamlessly transition between ministries overnight and suddenly become an expert in each field? ConsequencesThe lack of proper education and thorough understanding of the policymakers’ responsibilities is causing serious problems at the policy level. This is the main reason for their narrow-mindedness—their inability to accept diversity and expert opinions—and to understand complex social and economic phenomena, which leads them to have a “holier-than-thou” and “I am the law” attitude. Huge economic costs and unnecessary social burdens come with that. Every economic policy comes with economic and social costs. Economic costs are of two types: Direct costs and opportunity costs. Direct costs are the actual tangible expenditures associated with implementing a policy and can be easily measured. Opportunity costs are implicit and come with forgone policy alternatives. These are difficult to measure, yet are crucial for policy evaluation, as they directly affect overall output or the economy. For example, had the home minister's recent ruling not been halted by the Supreme Court, it would have cost the nation an estimated Rs250 million a year. This calculation is based on the daily productivity of an individual ($1434/365) at the current exchange rate (Rs133.25/USD) and 1,300 incidences per day. The recent impulsive decision by the Road Department, under Raghuvir Mahaseth, to blacktop a section of the New Road, led to financial costs. If the minister were concerned about the people and the economy, he would have worked to speed up the construction of the remaining section of the Ring Road, which has far more important economic, social, and health and environmental concerns. As a result of these difficulties, households are bearing extra social costs, and the retail and service economies are losing productivity in the area due to a lack of proper infrastructure and environmental quality. Further, this will only increase the cost of production over time and reduce the country’s output because of fewer economic activities. Similarly, the former finance minister Janardan Sharma’s controversial tax policy and the current finance minister Barsha Man Pun's ineffective policy of distributing the budget for their cadres through popular programmes such as the Prime Minister Daughter Resilient Programme—when similar programmes like former PM KP Oli’s Prime Minister Employment Programme turned into white elephants—will add further burden. The inconsistency in the government’s policies, such as reducing tax last year and increasing this year on electric vehicles, shows a lack of understanding of the matter. These are just a few examples of irrational and farfetched laws and policies of the past and incumbent governments. The politicians’ behaviours and self-righteous actions put a huge economic, social and environmental toll on the nation. Additionally, policies that lead to the depletion of natural resources and allocation of public property to private politicians’ cronies result from the irresponsibility of the leaders. Not to forget, the decisions of the former government led by KP Oli to allow the commercialisation and export of natural resources from the Chure region and swap the land of the Jhapa-based Giri Bandhu Tea Estate are no less concerning. There should be stringent mechanisms to control politicians’ reckless decisions. Though the Supreme Court has been overturning such steps, self-fulfilling politicians like those in the current and past governments remain a nuisance. Politicians must be made responsible for their deeds, even if they do not trigger corruption cases. Publicising cost-benefit analysis before formulating any such policies and regulations should be made mandatory. Otherwise, no matter whether the old or the new leaders make it to the government with their chicaneries, Nepal will continue to bear economic, social and environmental costs.  \nIn what looks like a perfect example of a circle of financial gain and loss, Nepal is sending a significant amount of money, much of which is earned through remittance, to foreign destinations every year to pay for the higher education of Nepalis. In the first nine months of the fiscal year 2023-24, which began in mid-July, the country sent out 95.85 billion rupees in foreign education alone. The figure could be even higher, as students and their guardians often find non-conventional or illegal mediums, including hundi, to transfer money abroad. What is alarming is that the official figures represent a 42.5 percent increase from the same duration in the last fiscal year, when students took Rs67.19 billion to spend on education abroad. In FY 2022-23, the total outgoing amount stood at Rs142 billion, a 48 percent rise from the Rs67.70 billion in FY 2021-22.Along with cash, the number of Nepali youths leaving home for education abroad is growing each year. In the first eight months of the current fiscal year, over 90,000 students have obtained the no-objection certificate (NOC) from the Ministry of Education. The total figure for FY 2022-23 stood at over 110,000, while it was almost 113,000 in FY 2021-22. As per the Ministry of Education, the number of students obtaining NOC has tripled in the past decade. That these students start earning after a few years and send money is a positive fact not to be missed—Nepal’s remittance is growing every year, thanks to the students-turned-non-resident Nepalis and labour migrants. But what we gain from remittance, we end up losing in the form of human capital. At a median age of 27.1, we are still a relatively younger country, which makes us a lucrative source for the export of youths.Our youths are heading out of the country in hundreds of thousands each year, and the risk is that they might return to the country only when we have missed the train of development. It is no surprise that 33 percent of the NOCs are obtained for study in Japan, a country of old people with a median age of almost 50 years. Ageing or aged developed countries like Japan, the United States and Canada, among many others, need a constant supply of youth migrants willing to toil hard. Poor countries of Asia and Africa have become rich sources for the export of cheap labour that not only sustains the economies of developed countries but also supplies children who transform from immigrants to naturalised citizens and keep those countries in rude demographic health.Meanwhile, those in positions of power in Nepal, including political leaders, bureaucrats and university and school authorities, continue to turn the country into an undesirable place. As education becomes expensive and the job market is saturated, youths see no reason to stay back in Nepal. While education abroad is no guarantee of success, we have collectively failed to assure students of the quality of education we are offering at home. Apart from improving the quality itself, we also need to work on image-building—that Nepal’s education is not as bad as it has been made out to be.    \nWestern powers and countries from the rest of the world will use the second day of a major summit in Switzerland on Sunday to pursue a consensus on condemning Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and underscoring concerns about the war's human cost.A draft of the final summit declaration seen by Reuters refers to Russia's invasion as a “war”- a label Moscow rejects - and calls for Ukraine’s control over the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant and its Azov Sea ports to be restored.Moscow casts what it calls its special military operation in Ukraine as part of a broader struggle with the West, which it says wants to bring Russia to its knees. Kyiv and the West say Russia is waging an illegal war of conquest.World leaders including US Vice President Kamala Harris, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and French President Emmanuel Macron gathered this weekend at a mountaintop resort in a bid to bolster international support for ending the war.Many Western leaders voiced forceful condemnation of the invasion, invoking the UN Charter in defense of Ukrainian territorial integrity, and rejecting Russian President Vladimir Putin's demands for parts of Ukraine as a condition for peace.“One thing is clear in this conflict: there is an aggressor, which is Putin, and there is a victim, which is the Ukrainian people,” Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said.Some leaders are expected to depart early, and talks on Sunday will turn towards pursuing a joint position on the need for nuclear and food security, and the return of prisoners of war and children removed from Ukraine during the conflict.White House National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan told reporters Qatar had helped to mediate the return from Russia of 30 or more Ukrainian children to their families.“It’s going to take international pressure. It’s going to take a spotlight from the international community – and not just from the voices from the United States or Europe – but from unusual voices, as well, to say what Russia has done here is morally reprehensible and must be reversed,” he said.Kyiv says about 20,000 children have been taken to Russia or Russian-occupied territory without the consent of family or guardians since the war began. Moscow rejects this, saying it has protected vulnerable children from the war zone.The draft communique, dated June 13, calls for all illegally deported children to be returned.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy hailed the participation of more than 90 countries at the Buergenstock resort overlooking Lake Lucerne as a show of international support for Kyiv, even as some European allies said a broader outreach was needed to build a lasting peace plan.One central ambition of the Swiss and Ukrainian organisers is to announce on Sunday the host country for a follow-up conference meant to build on the Swiss momentum.Saudi Arabia is one of the favourites, and Foreign Minister Prince Faisal bin Farhan Al Saud said the kingdom was ready to assist the peace process, but warned that a viable settlement would hinge on “difficult compromise.”Striking a balance in the summit’s final declaration between forthright condemnation of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and wording that commands the broadest possible support has been part of the diplomatic tug-of-war at the event, sources say.It remains to be seen how many countries will back a final joint declaration, and Austrian Chancellor Karl Nehammer on Saturday sought to temper hopes somewhat.“Just to manage expectations, please: the crucial take-away is that we’ve all come here, that we’re talking, that many different nations and continents are talking to each other ... This is the essence of this conference,” he said. “Peace and peace processes take time, working millimetre by millimetre.” \nAs many as 10 people, including children, were shot and wounded at a city-run water park near Detroit on Saturday evening, police said, calling the incident random gunfire.The suspect was still at large late on Saturday, but police said they believed he was cornered in a house nearby. The gun was found at the scene, police said.A man got out of a vehicle in front of Brooklands Plaza Splash Pad park, in Rochester Hills, Michigan, about 5 p.m. (2100 GMT) and fired about 30 shots from a 9mm semiautomatic Glock, reloading several times, Oakland County Sheriff Michael Bouchard told a press conference.It was not immediately clear if there were any fatalities, said police, who had initially reported five people shot.Rochester Hills is about 30 miles (50 km) north of Detroit. The neighbouring community Oxford Township, also in Oakland County, was the scene of a 2021 mass school shooting where student Ethan Crumbley, then 15, killed four students and wounded six other students and a teacher at Oxford High School.“It’s a gut punch, obviously, for us here in Oakland County,” Bouchard said. “We’ve gone through so many tragedies, you know. We’re not even fully comprehending what happened at Oxford.”Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer said on X, “I am heartbroken to learn about the shooting in Rochester Hills.” \nThe weather is forecast to be partly to generally cloudy throughout the country on Sunday.Light to moderate rain with thunder and lightning is likely to occur in some places of Gandaki, Koshi and Bagmati provinces the Meteorological Forecasting Division said. In Madhesh and the rest of the country, similar conditions may occur in one or two places.Tonight, partly to generally cloudy weather is expected at Koshi, Madhesh, Bagmati and Gandaki provinces with chances of light to moderate rain with thunder and lightning in Madhesh, Koshi and high hilly regions of Bagmati and Gandaki provinces. Dhangadi experienced the hottest day in the country with temperatures rising to 42.7 degrees Celsius while Jomsom recorded a minimum temperature of 12.0 degrees Celsius. Meanwhile, Kathmandu’s temperature rose to a maximum of 35.3 degrees Celsius on Saturday.  \nAs John Berger, a prominent art critic and novelist, said, art is the enduring legacy of a generation, preserving the thoughts, beliefs, politics, and passions of an entire era. When all is perished, what remains is art, a reflection of an era’s collective consciousness, preserved for posterity. Art is both the most accessible and spiritual form of an archive, distinct from academic records. It is because, unlike other forms of archives, art captures both the profound and the mundane, even when they lie in striking juxtaposition. It embodies emotions and experiences too complex for words, nurturing the drive in artists of different eras to innovate beyond conventional forms of expression and mediums.The most recent art exhibition at Gallery Mcube’s ‘Young Artists Show’ features ten young artists’ expressions of love, angst, and struggle for the world around them all within one space. This exhibition features stunning, inventive, and evocative artworks that explore a wide range of subjects and emotions. The artworks represent a diverse group of young artists from various parts of Nepal.Harshita Singh’s artwork is the first thing you see as you enter the space. It incorporates her pottery practice and her fascination with the concept of ‘Hamsa’, which represents hands. Her creation is both original and compelling. I found myself staring at artwork for extended periods, trying to unravel its meanings and the artistic processes behind it.Subodh Bhandari and Sambrididhi R Shakya’s ‘What Makes a City’ deserve a larger and extended exhibition because of the issues it raises. This intricate mixed-media features layers of symbolism that will engage art enthusiasts and amateurs alike. With a specific focus on Kathmandu, these works explore the essence of urban life and the difficulties faced by cities, employing materials like plastic sacks, glass, intricate paintwork, and calligraphy.These artworks address Kathmandu’s waste management issues and water scarcity with sensitivity and insight. They also shed light on Nepal’s brain drain problem, highlighting its impact on the city and its inhabitants. Overall, ‘What Makes a City’ by Subodh Bhandari and Sambrididhi R Shakya not only showcases their artistic prowess but also raises important social and environmental issues in a visually compelling and thought-provoking way.As I walked through the exhibition, I came across feathers painted with detailed, lifelike images of different birds hovering around a levitating tree branch in an enthralling spectacle. More feathers scattered all over the floor, each one intricately painted with bird art. I found the concept to be both captivating and innovative, pushing the boundaries of artistic expression with daring experimentation. This artwork is part of Ronisha Shrestha’s series ‘Abandoned Companions’, in which she compassionately portrays the fate of animals in urban landscapes with incredible empathy.Saran Tandukar’s ‘Scarecrow’ stands out from the rest of the artworks presented in the space. He has collected clothes and fabrics from his community to capture stories, memories, and their essence.His work reflects the migration struggles in our community. He says, “When there is a drought, everybody leaves their home and field, even if they are emotionally connected. The situation forces them to leave everything behind.”He expresses feeling like an abandoned scarecrow in a drought-stricken field, watching his friends and family depart. Just as no one takes a scarecrow when they migrate, he feels as if he is left behind—a sentiment shared by many families and communities in Nepal.The artist’s expertise in working with cloth, particularly in capturing human features, adds an intriguing layer to the piece. His skill in painting with cloth, especially in depicting people's faces and structures, adds a fascinating dimension to the pieces.As part of this series, the exhibition features cubes adorned with levitated fabrics—a sight that further enhances the thematic exploration and visual impact of the artworks on display.The two artworks presented by Rojan Rai, ‘Sweet Smile’ and ‘Bags Full of Uncertainties’, intertwine graffiti-style street art and integrate traditional forms of painting. They feature the essence of daily life through the depiction of the resilience of street vendors.‘Bags Full of Uncertainties’ depicts a middle-aged street vendor overwhelmed by the number of bags he carries. This painting highlights the burdens of uncertainty while also showcasing the beauty of resilience. It is a poignant and powerful reminder to embrace life’s unpredictability and cherish each moment.The second artwork by Rojan also shows a street vendor, but this one is a child. ‘Sweet Smile’ depicts a little boy selling cotton candy against a backdrop bearing the word ‘SWEET’ in bold graffiti style. The boy’s joyous grin, contrasted against this vivid background, exemplifies the beauty and resilience of ordinary life.Gallery Mcube’s ‘Young Artists Show’ not only exhibits budding artists’ enormous potential but also expresses the new generation's emotions and sociopolitical challenges. It showcases their artistic ability and also addresses important social and environmental issues in visually appealing and innovative ways. The gallery’s initiative to spotlight these talented artists is truly commendable.

The war in Gaza between Israel and Hamas has also diverted the world's attention from Ukraine.The talks will focus on broader concerns triggered by the war, such as food and nuclear security.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has trumpeted the summit's wide attendance as a success and predicted \"history being made\", adding that agreements stemming from it will be part of the peacemaking process.\"Ukraine never wanted this war. It's a criminal and absolutely unprovoked aggression by Russia,\" he said alongside Swiss President Viola Amherd, who said the conflict had brought \"unimaginable suffering\" and violated international law.German Chancellor Olaf Scholz called the gathering an important step to discuss peace and security questions.\"This is a small plant that needs to be watered, but of course also with the perspective that more can then come out of it,\" he told Welt TV.Biden sent US Vice President Kamala Harris to represent him—riling Kyiv—while Saudi Arabian Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman will be represented by his foreign minister and India dispatched a lower-level delegation. Beijing is staying away after Russia was frozen out of proceedings.Harris announced more than $1.5 billion in energy and humanitarian aid for Ukraine, where infrastructure has been pounded by Russian airstrikes since the 2022 invasion.\"This war remains an utter failure for [Russian President Vladimir] Putin,\" Harris said during a meeting with Zelenskiy.A military helicopter hovered over the luxury Buergenstock resort overlooking Lake Lucerne on Saturday as leaders arrived by helicopter on a patch of grassland fenced off with razor wire while cows grazed nearby.On the eve of the summit, Putin said Russia would end the war only if Kyiv agreed to drop its NATO ambitions and hand over four provinces claimed by Moscow—demands Kyiv swiftly rejected as tantamount to surrender.Putin's conditions apparently reflected Moscow's growing confidence that its forces have the upper hand in the war. Scholz cast them as an attempt to muddy the waters.\"Everyone knows that this is not a serious proposal, but had something to do with the peace conference in Switzerland,\" he said in a separate TV interview.Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said Putin's proposal had \"shown the real path to peace\".\"If you want to save the world, discuss Vladimir Putin's proposal ... Only those who do not want peace can't see, can't understand it,\" TASS news agency quoted her as saying.China and RussiaZelenskiy has accused Beijing of helping Moscow undermine the gathering, an accusation China's Foreign Ministry denied.The leaders of France, Germany, Italy, Britain, Canada and Japan are among those due to attend. Turkey and Hungary, which maintain friendlier ties with Russia, are also expected to join.Austrian Chancellor Karl Nehammer said it was an opportunity to start building a broader global consensus to put pressure on Russia.\"It's like we're in a Western echo chamber. That is: all Western European countries, the USA, we agree on what we want to happen with Ukraine,\" Nehammer said. \"But that alone is not enough.\"Neutral Switzerland, which took on the summit at Zelenskiy's behest, wants to pave the way for a future peace process that includes Russia. Saudi Arabia or Turkey have been mooted as possible hosts.Calls for Russia to be at the table will only get stronger over time, said Bob Deen, senior research fellow at the Netherlands-based Clingendael Institute think-tank.\"There is a risk that if Ukraine waits too long, it might end up with rival formats popping up. It may risk losing the initiative,\" Dean told a forum on the summit's sidelines.Supporters of Ukraine are marking the talks with a series of events in the nearby city of Lucerne to draw attention to the war's humanitarian costs.On Saturday afternoon, about 250 people gathered in the centre of the city, many wrapped in Ukrainian flags, wearing traditional clothes and carrying pictures of missing brothers, husbands or sons as they shared their stories.\"I'm clinging to the idea that my husband is still alive,\" said Svitlana Bilous, the wife of a soldier who has been missing for more than 14 months. \"That's what keeps me going.\" \nThe Millennium Challenge Account Nepal (MCA-Nepal) has signed a contract with Techno Electric and Engineering Company Ltd India to construct a 400 kV substation at Ratmate in Belkotgadhi Municipality-7 of Nuwakot district as part of implementing Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) Nepal Compact.“The 400 kV Gas Insulated Switchgear (GIS) substation will be constructed within the contract duration of 39 months,” the MCA-Nepal said in a statement on Saturday. “Once completed, Ratmate Substation will have a capacity of 1000 Mega Volt Ampere making it one of the largest substations in the country.”The new $51.6 million Ratmate Substation will serve as a critical interconnection of power transmission between the Lapsiphedi and New Hetauda Substations, said the MCA-Nepal, the body responsible for implementing the MCC projects in the country.Khadga Bahadur Bisht, executive director at the MCA-Nepal, and Rajiv Agarwal, director- commercial at Techno Electric and Engineering Company Ltd India, signed and exchanged the contract in the presence of MCC and MCA-Nepal officials.With the execution of this contract, MCA-Nepal has signed two of the three substations construction contracts planned under the MCC Nepal Compact.Nepal Electricity Authority Managing Director Kul Man Ghising has described the signing of the deal as an important progress in implementing the MCC Compact.“The 400 kV Ratmate Substation, as envisioned in the Transmission System Development Plan of Nepal (TSDPN), is a critical component of Nepal’s national power transmission system and yet another milestone in MCC Nepal Compact’s contribution to the energy sector in Nepal,” he said.Diane L Francisco, resident country director of Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC), said the signing of the Ratmate Substation, the second of the three substations, marks a significant stride forward as the MCC Nepal Compact builds momentum in its implementation.“Over the next few years, we are confident that the progress of the MCC Nepal Compact will provide critical contributions to Nepal’s growing energy sector, helping meet Nepal’s evolving needs, bolstering Nepal’s immense potential, and bringing prosperity to the Nepali people,” Francisco said. Last month, the MCA-Nepal had signed a contract with another Indian company for the construction of a substation in Nawalparasi. Linxon India Pvt Ltd bagged the contract for the construction of the 400kV New Butwal Substation in Nawalparasi.MCA-Nepal Executive Director Bisht shared that the MCA-Nepal is expediting all works for the construction of the substations and transmission lines under the Electricity Transmission Project funded by the US government’s Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) and the government of Nepal.“The contract for the third substation in Damauli is in the pipeline and the bids for the 18-km cross-border line are under evaluation,” he said. “We are also at the final stages of the procurement process to invite bids for the construction of the remaining portion of the transmission line as well.”The 400 kV Ratmate Substation will also have evacuation capacity of around 3,200 MW of power from hydropower projects and substations. The reliable power at various voltage levels at the substation will be available for distribution in Nepal to enhance industrial and commercial activities, the MCA-Nepal said.Along with three substations, the MCC Nepal Compact will fund the construction of up to 315 km of transmission line from Lapsiphedi, Kathmandu to the Nepal-India border in Nawalparasi (Bardaghat Susta West) under the Electricity Transmission Project.The bids for the 18 km cross-border transmission line have been received for evaluation and that it aims to award the contract in August, said the MCA-Nepal. “Likewise, preparations are on track to ensure the bids for the remaining 297 km of transmission lines are relaunched at the earliest possible this year,” it said. \nThe caretaker Prime Minister of India, Narendra Modi, is all set to take the oath of office for the third constitutive term on Sunday evening, with the invited South Asian leaders to witness the ceremony. Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal will fly to New Delhi to attend the swearing-in, and the two prime ministers will hold a meeting after the ceremony, according to government officials. A Cabinet meeting on Thursday approved the prime minister’s visit to India. It will be a two-day trip, says Rekha Sharma, Minister for Communication and Information Technology. On Wednesday, Modi phoned Prime Minister Dahal and they briefly discussed the upcoming meeting, according to government officials.Modi is set to become the second Indian prime minister after Jawaharlal Nehru to serve three constitutive terms. The third term will be different from his first two as he was the prime minister backed by an absolute majority for his party, the Bharatiya Janata Party, in the last two terms. This time, Modi has to rely on coalition partners under the banner of the National Democratic Alliance.With Modi entering his third term, will Nepal-India ties change, or will they remain the same? Modi has championed the “Neighborhood First” policy in his dealings with South Asian nations. Modi is the only Indian prime minister who has visited Nepal more than once—in 2014 and 2018, and again in 2022. Thus, he knows all top leaders of Nepal and is fully aware of bilateral issues, having served in the office for a decade.“India’s policy towards Nepal will not change. There is very much consistency in their policy towards Nepal,” said former foreign minister Ramesh Nath Pandey. “Modi will have control over Nepal policy.In the past decade, several Nepali prime ministers have visited India and interacted with Modi. The Indian prime minister is thus fully aware of Nepal’s concerns and interests, as well as India's expectations of Nepal. However, according to Pandey, Nepal has squandered a decade trying to shed the historical baggage and resolve bilateral differences.This time, the BJP’s coalition partner, the Janata Dal (United), hails from the bordering state of Bihar. The JDU has called for a review of India’s controversial Agnipath scheme, under which hundreds of Nepali youths used to be recruited into the Indian Army’s Gorkha regiments. The Nepal government has refused to allow India to recruit its youth under this short-term scheme, arguing that the 1947 agreement between Nepal, India and Britain stipulated full-term service in both the Indian and British Armies, not short-term enlistment.“Prime Minister Modi had a telephone conversation with the Prime Minister of Nepal,” said an Indian government statement on Thursday. During the talks, Prime Minister Dahal congratulated Prime Minister Modi on his historic victory in the recently concluded Indian general elections, according to the statement.The statement said, “Dahal was convinced that, under Prime Minister Modi's leadership, India-Nepal relations would continue to strengthen.”Nepal shares deep-rooted cultural and civilizational links with India and remains a special partner in India’s ‘Neighbourhood First’ policy, added the statement.Nepal and India have many commonalities and differences that surface from time to time. Issues like boundary disputes, Nepal’s call for scrapping the Peace and Friendship Treaty of 1950 and drafting a new one, and the submission of the report of the Eminent Persons Group on Nepal-India relations, among others, remain key bottlenecks in the bilateral ties. Once again, Modi has an opportunity to resolve them.Some Indian experts also claimed that although Modi’s new government will include several coalition partners, the policy towards Nepal will fundamentally remain unchanged. But Modi’s new term is full of challenges as he will have to rely on and persuade his alliance partners and this could lead to instability in governance.Ranjit Rae, former Indian ambassador to Nepal, said that India’s foreign policy will remain unchanged in Modi’s third term as there is broad consensus among the parties on key foreign policy issues. “As Nitish Kumar is in the government and Bihar shares a long border with Nepal, Nepal will remain important in the foreign policy architecture,” Rae said. “Primarily, India’s ‘Neighbourhood First’ policy will continue.” On reviewing the Agnipath scheme, Rae said that it would be good if the new government reviewed it. According to the Indian media, there are hard bargains among coalition partners in New Delhi on power-sharing and it remains to be decided which party gets what portfolio.The two key alliance partners, N Chandrababu Naidu of the Telugu Desam Party and Nitish Kumar, both have secular credentials, so a party-centric foreign policy is unlikely to dominate during Modi’s third term, said Nihar Nayak, Research Fellow at the New Delhi-based Manohar Parrikar Institute for Defence Studies and Analyses (MP-IDSA).According to Nayak, the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) could see a revival, and as per the strong demands of Nitish Kumar’s JDU, the Agnipath scheme will also be scrapped.“If the Agnipath scheme is scrapped or reviewed, relations with Nepal will improve. The second thing is that there will be no BJP foreign policy. India’s insecurity in the region will diminish. The call for the restoration of the Hindu state in Nepal is unlikely to crop up as prominently. There will be changes in some aspects of foreign policy as Modi will be compelled to heed his coalition partners,” said Nayak. \nThe Oli government's decision to allow land swaps for the Giri Bandhu Tea Estate was overturned by the Supreme Court, leading to accusations of \"policy corruption\" and a demand for an investigation by the Nepali Congress and others.\nThe collective indignity bestowed on political women, from Shailaja Acharya to Sumana Shrestha, by political patriarchs needs immediate redress. In today’s time, when power has ceased to be a zero-sum game and good leadership is synonymous with collaboration, the traditionally inclined old men clumsily spewing patriarchal narratives make civilised citizens extremely uncomfortable. Political women with independent political personhood have always been problematic to traditional men. Sahana’s grit, Shailaja’s impatience, Binda’s blatant feminism and Sumana’s formidability seem to have threatened those with the traditional bent of mind. At least two generations of strong, opinionated women have been sidelined or ousted because they did not fit into the mould of patriarchal party politics. It almost seems like the traditional men view them as political “shrews” who, like in the famous Shakespearean play The Taming of the Shrew, need to be “tamed”, cut to a size that is desirable to political patriarchy.Until not long ago, the concept of a “good woman” stemmed from feminine subservience and obedience. Women’s personhood was stunted through intense psychological conditioning that can be traced back to the origins of the state and society. A woman was told how her family’s honour rested on her good character. She was introduced to a heavy burden of feminine morality at an early age. With stories being fed about good women versus bad, patriarchy was very successful in grooming girls to grow up to be good women and obedient keepers of their family’s honour. Subservience was the prerequisite to being a good woman. A good woman was anything but defiant, and if by chance she did get tempted to disobey and defy the norms, she paid a hefty price. This “truth” was continuously fed into the feminine psyche, mostly through religious texts and scriptures. These women were duly punished in the ancient scriptures and medieval texts crafted and propagated by men.Vyaas wrote the story of how Draupadi was dragged by her hair and abused publicly because she had made fun of Duryodhana, leading to the great war between the Pandava and Kaurava brothers. Mother Mary was glorified as a virgin, while Mary Magdalene was vilified as a “loose” woman and had to be rescued. Sita’s disobedience tempted Ravana and caused much grief to Lord Ram. Eve disobeyed the Lord and ate the apple only to be the cause of Adam’s banishment. Khadija was a strong woman and a successful merchant before she married the Prophet, but she submitted herself to him and became his first disciple. In addition, the annual celebration of Swasthani Vrata Katha revered the ideal woman in the form of Goma Brahmani, who never protested, tolerated every injustice inflicted against her personhood. The idea of feminine morality has been strongly correlated with women’s socio-cultural subservience, religious conformity, psychological and economic fragility and physical docility. Even in politics, the men in charge prefer women who embody traditional femininity. However, here lies the problem: The idea of moral, subservient women clashes with the essence of equality and freedom propounded by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Women who have learned the freedoms cannot unlearn them. Today, several women in politics are highly qualified, independent, articulate and honest. They live the most painful existence because the unlearning of patriarchal values has already taken place within them, and they have a fully developed sense of personhood, which, however, is repeatedly obliterated by their party men or other political men who still operate by the patriarchal rules. Strong, independent, ethical women are repeatedly denied space in the party’s leadership. Educated, dignified, honest, resolute, independent and opinionated, Shailja Acharya was often ridiculed for her “short temper” and “moods”. In UML’s case, Sahana’s leadership in the inter-party women’s caucus irked her party men. An economist by training, she was more qualified than most men in her party, but her commitment to the larger political sorority was perceived as defiance; therefore, a covert “cutting to size” was practised against her as well. Narratives are created to invalidate women as viable leaders. These days, the “tamings” have become more overt. Binda Pandey, one of the handful of qualified women inside UML, was denied an election ticket, and the insider quickly pointed out that her “attitude” killed her prospects. The same has been the case with Shiva Maya Tumbahamphe, Kamala Panta, Shashi Shrestha, and others. Women’s recruitment, retention and promotions in parties seek obedient, subservient “yes-women” who do not have to be “tamed”. The latest “taming” attempt, however, appears much more menacing than the past. A woman with an ivy-league education, who speaks the global language, wears gender-neutral clothing, questions the old guards about procedural gaps, carries her own bags, drives her own car and has managed to keep herself out of the clout-centric politics so far, must irk the political retainers quite intensely to receive such blatant, overt attacks regarding her personal choices: From her clothing to her life partner. KP Oli has tried dismantling Sumana Shrestha’s political legitimacy and citizenship by calling Nepal her maita. The chauvinism that drips from Oli’s statement is disgustingly archaic, feudal and regressive for a leader of his stature.Bringing Shrestha into the helm of political give-and-take does not seem to have worked; if it had, Oli would not have had to start “taming” her. If she was unapologetically vocal as a member of the opposition, she seems adamant as a minister to fix the portfolio given to her. Maybe it is her “audacity” to fix the system at the ministry that has somehow miffed the old guard like Oli. His recent rants, aimed to paint her as a frivolous, westernised young woman whose political journey is a mere fluke, scream his intense insecurities. If that is indeed the case, then maybe Sumana Shrestha is doing something right, and we need more “shrew” muckrakers like her.  \nNepal prepares to auction 5G frequency after a three-year halt, despite concerns about investments, market readiness, and economic viability.\nEducation in Every Home’s report titled ‘Diversity, Equity and Inclusion in Nepal’s Textbooks’ highlights the lack of diversity, inclusivity, and inaccuracies in these textbooks.  The findings include egregious mistakes in textbooks like the inclusion of a letter Abraham Lincloln supposedly wrote—dating to a time 17 years after his assassination, to assertions like Brazil has tigers, elephants and rhinos while Germany has tigers and monkeys. The books display a clear bias in favour of Brahmin Chhetri males, while women make up just 18 percent of all people profiled. While 80 percent of all bylines are male, the presence of marginalised communities, especially Dalits, is nearly non-existent.  \nCrucial events unfold, shaping destinies and altering the course of history.\nThe Araniko Project, which is also a popular blog, aims to uncover the past and present of the Nepal-China relations by using primary sources in Mandarin. A fluent Mandarin speaker, Rajbhandari, who has lived in Beijing for six years, has a master’s degree in Chinese politics from Renmin University of China.  In this conversation, she talks about Chinese historiography on Nepal, the nuances of Mandarin-to-English translation, Nepal-China ties and the importance of understanding Chinese language in order to understand the country. \nNeupane was one of the conveners of ‘Project Sambad’, “a collaborative platform hosted by a group of Nepali institutions, designed to promote in-depth conversations that critically examine Nepali society and its policy-making space.” The first edition of the event happened in Kathmandu on March 14 and 15.  In this interview, the two discuss the state of Nepali public debates and ways to foster better discussions on vital issues. \nWhy do we romanticise the dead? Why can’t we be honest about them? Especially moms. They’re the most romanticised of anyone.”One rarely comes across a book titled ‘I’m Glad My Mom Died’. My first thought after stumbling onto this literary piece was what possibly could have been the author’s grudge towards her mother for naming the book with such an abrasive title. And quite fittingly, the title has made its mark by drawing attention from readers worldwide, making the book a New York Times bestseller. American writer, filmmaker, former actress, and singer Jennette McCurdy has created a stir in the literary scene with her debut book, ‘I’m glad my mom died’. The book’s main theme revolves around the complicated relationship between the author and her mother. The book also explores other themes such as abuse, child stardom and exploitation, eating disorders, grief and healing, and finally, resilience and survival. The memoir opens with the celebration of McCurdy’s sixth birthday when her mom presents her with a two-piece outfit surrounded by daisies. McCurdy throws on her best fake smile and exclaims it to be her favourite birthday gift ever. This particular event prods the readers to be cautious about the series of events that will unfold, hinting at the complex and often painful dynamics of her relationship with her mother that are to be revealed throughout the narrative.The general perception regarding abuse tends to focus primarily on physical violence overlooking other forms, such as emotional and psychological abuse. McCurdy, in her memoir, chronicles the continuum of emotional and psychological abuse she had to face throughout her childhood at the hands of her mother. Just like any other helicopter parent, McCurdy’s mother projects her unmet aspiration of becoming an actor to her daughter. She then continues to micromanage every aspect of McCurdy’s life, often pressuring her to achieve the dream that she once harboured. The authoritarian demeanour of the mother leaves McCurdy to develop OCD from a young age which she refers to as the “Holy Ghost”. Due to her age, she isn’t fully aware of how harmful the condition she was diagnosed with can be. Instead, she is thrilled to have conversations with the “Holy Ghost” where she says, “I can talk to the holy ghost whenever I want to, and he can talk to me, guiding me to do what is right, which is whatever he tells me to do. I am so lucky”. As the memoir continues, the readers find that the mother uses McCurdy’s fame to pay their bills, often flaunting her daughter’s success to maintain her unattained lifestyle. McCurdy’s struggle to make her mother understand her aspiration to become a writer instead of an actor is similar to the struggle of the character Farhan in the Bollywood hit ‘3 Idiots’, where, at last, the orthodox father finally lets his son pursue his interest of becoming a photographer. However, in McCurdy’s case, her mother is dismissive of her daughter’s ambition and instead tries to manipulate her daughter by saying, “Writer’s dress is frumpy and fat. I would never want your little actress’s peach butt to turn into a big, giant writer’s watermelon butt.”The emotional quandary of McCurdy’s is further complicated when her mother gets diagnosed with breast cancer. The mother’s manipulative behaviour leads her to make her children watch the video of her cancer diagnosis time and again until her children take it to blame themselves for the cause of their mother’s cancer. Ultimately, McCurdy considers it her job to save her mother from mortal sickness as cancer. She tries every rule in the book to get validation from her mother to the extent that she hides her preferred colour, purple, just because her mother prefers pink.The situation worsens when even after having reached the age of 16, the mother thinks it is a good idea to let her son and daughter shower in the same bathroom.Similarly, she puts McCurdy on a strict diet plan of calorie restriction. She is even made to read every diet-related book even before she gets her menstruation. The memoir is divided into two parts, i.e. before and after. ‘Before’ chronicles McCurdy’s experience with her abusive mother, whereas ‘After’ poignantly describes the harrowing effect of bulimia as a result of her mother’s years of abuse. The book also focuses on the ethical and developmental concerns of exposing a child to the limelight from a young age through McCurdy’s personal experience in the Hollywood industry. It also highlights the damage the entertainment industry can do to a child’s mental and emotional well-being.The book shines in its execution, particularly in addressing the question, “What does grief look like when you don’t share a great relationship with your loved one?” This question ties seamlessly into the title, as McCurdy struggles to recognise and cope with her emotions following her mother’s death. The universal practice of idolising one’s mother makes it difficult for her to acknowledge the abuse she endured during childhood—adding layers to her grief and healing process. Despite being a candid account of McCurdy’s experience with abuse, the nature of the memoir can resonate with Nepali readers. It mirrors the stark reality of Nepali households, where children often bear the burden of their parents’ unfulfilled dreams of securing a stable job. This restricts them from following their desire when it comes to careers. The memoir plays its part in demonstrating that fame is not everything; it is frequently nothing at all. It urges its readers to see the thin line that demarcates the life of an ordinary person and a celebrity. However, underneath the line lies a shared humanity that transcends fame and fortune, reminding us that our intrinsic value is not defined by external measures of success.The memoir should come with a trigger warning because its graphic narration of emotional abuse might make readers uncomfortable. This disrupted the linear flow of my reading experience, making it difficult to progress through the book. However, the author’s touch of sarcasm creates an engaging authorial voice. Destined to become an actor yet a natural when it comes to writing, McCurdy has set the train in motion through her candid yet moving writing. She accurately describes the mental state of her formative years, which skillfully captures the emotions she wishes to convey. The memoir ends on a hopeful note as McCurdy affirms, “Mom didn’t get better. But I will.”I’m Glad My Mom Died Author: Jennette McCurdyYear: 2022Publisher: Simon and Schuster \nThe ruling and opposition parties might appear divided as they relentlessly attack each other on different issues, but when it comes to criticising the decisions of Sumana Shrestha, the minister for education, science, and technology, they have one voice.Shortly after taking charge of the ministry, Shrestha started a process of taking action against the teachers and professors involved in party politics. The ministry has sought information on the teachers and professors affiliated to the parties from the Election Commission and the respective district education units.The initiative was taken as per the Political Parties Act, 2017 which prohibits the teachers, professors and other government employees from engaging in politics. Similarly, the Patan High Court on October 5, 2021 had ruled that school teachers cannot engage in active politics. Responding to a writ petition, the court said those drawing salaries and benefits from the state coffers should not be involved in partisan politics. The major parties have disapproved of Shrestha’s move as a large number of teachers are their cadres. For instance, as many as 263 of the 4,743 representatives to the Nepali Congress general convention held in December 2021 were school teachers and staff. The number is above five percent of the total delegates.The main opposition CPN-UML also had dozens of teachers as representatives in its 10th general congress held in November that year. Hundreds of school teachers are associated with the CPN (Maoist Centre) as well.Leaders from all these parties have criticised the move directly or indirectly. Speaking in the House of Representatives on Tuesday, Maoist Centre Secretary Devendra Paudel said the principals of many best-performing community schools were affiliated to different parties.“It is unnecessary to test teachers’ DNA. Let them work,” he said, implying that there was no need to probe whether the teachers are affiliated to a political party.Another factor antagonising the major parties is Shrestha’s decision to make public the report of the High-Level National Education Commission— more than five years after it was submitted to then-prime minister KP Sharma Oli.On June 7, she made public the report that Oli and his successors had for years kept under wraps. The government was under the pressure of private schools to keep the report a secret as it envisions converting the schools registered as companies into trusts within 10 years. Converting the existing schools into trusts would mean they will be barred from taking profits home. Several cross-party leaders have investments in private schools.Oli was so annoyed by Minister Shrestha’s decision to make the report public that he resorted to making personal remarks about her nationality and marital status without naming her.Now the teachers’ unions of various parties have united against her. The ministry on May 27 endorsed a directive guiding teachers’ transfers. The directive came amid allegations that teachers are being transferred without fulfilling the due procedure. The directive is accused of encroaching on the authority of the School Management Committee and increasing the ministry’s role in transfers. “Your good education is meaningless if you are doing more harm than good to the education sector,” said Shankar Adhikari, chair of the teacher association close to the Maoist Centre, referring to Shrestha’s foreign degree. “She has a shallow understanding of Nepal's education sector.”Leaders of other teacher associations have asked the minister to reverse the directive, warning of the consequences of not doing so. “The directive was issued with the mala fide intent of troubling teachers. This is unacceptable,” said Gyanedra Rawal of the Nepal Teachers’ Union, the Congress teachers’ wing.Some lawmakers and education experts, however, have supported minister Shrestha, saying she is on the right track to improve the country's education sector. Addressing the lower house meeting on Wednesday, independent lawmaker Amresh Kumar Singh said he fully supports the education minister, who is making the necessary intervention. “The education minister is taking the right course. Her works need to be appreciated,” he said.Those who have followed Shrestha’s work also praise her. “She [Shrestha] is eager to bring about vital changes, mainly in school education,” said Usha Jha, a former member of the National Planning Commission.However, many officials at the ministry are unhappy with her work. While she is dedicated to her job, she has a habit of not listening to others, they allege. “The minister thinks she knows everything and is not accommodative. This is the reason her decisions are dragged into controversy,” said a senior official at the ministry. “A minister is a team leader who has to take all the staff along. But that is not the case now.” \nThe Janata Samajbadi Party-Nepal (JSP-Nepal), led by Upendra Yadav, is set for its Unity General Convention, which will commence on Monday in Janakpur, a month after the party suffered a split.The federal chair of the JSP-Nepal, Ashok Rai, along with seven federal lawmakers and 30 central committee members, split the party on May 5 to form the Janata Samajbadi Party.The party split was more visible at the centre, but it is said to have had a lesser impact on Yadav’s faction in the province so far.Party insiders say the dissidents in provincial assemblies and party committees couldn’t get organised to form new committees as the registration of the new party at the election commission was immediately challenged in the Supreme Court. The court asked the commission and other authorities to put the process on hold, and the case is still sub judice. When the court gives a verdict on the issue, the JSP-Nepal's fence-sitters may decide whether to remain with the party or defect to the new outfit.Just a week before the unity general convention, the party suffered another setback as it had to give up the chief minister’s post in Madhesh Province when the erstwhile coalition partners–the CPN-UML and CPN (Maoist Centre)—withdrew their support to the government. During the floor test held on June 5 JSP-Nepal lawmaker Saroj Kumar Yadav, the immediate past chief minister of the province, fell 4 votes short from securing the position. When he garnered 50 votes in support, 53 members voted against him. In the 107-strong assembly, the chief minister has to secure at least 54 votes in support.Upendra Yadav's parties, including the current JSP-Nepal, continuously led the provincial government for almost seven years until Satish Kumar Singh of the Janamat Party dethroned Yadav’s party from the chief ministerial position on June 7.Though the recent party split and the dethroning of the Madhesh Province’s leadership can be blamed on the party leadership, according to analysts, the unity general convention poses little challenge to Yadav. Because of the split, there are no leaders left in the party who’d challenge Yadav, Chandra Kishore, an observer of Madhesh politics, told the Post. “Therefore, the general convention should be a walk in the park for him.” The party that held its statute convention last year adopted a policy of lobbying for a directly elected presidential system in the country. Likewise, the Madhesh-based party set the goal of fighting for a parliament with fully proportional representation. This is expected to direct policy at the unity convention. However, experts question the sustainability of the policies adopted by the statute convention in the party's post-split situation.“The policies adopted by the statute convention will remain intact,” Prakash Adhikari, a federal lawmaker of the party, told the Post. “The party division, which is sub judice in the Supreme Court, will not impact policy changes.”Chandra Kishore, who has been following Madhesh politics for a long time, differs from Adhikari.“Yadav is a political strategist. He acts as per the situation,” he said. “He will not necessarily act as per the party documents.” The JSP-Nepal’s central committee in January, two months before the split, decided to hold the unity general convention in June. The party decided to organise the convention in order to consolidate the unity between various Madhes-based parties over time, party leaders said.This is the first unity convention held after the merger of various Madhes-based parties, Manish Kumar Suman, spokesperson for the JSP-Nepal, told the Post.The Tarai Madhesh Loktantrik Party, led by Mahantha Thakur; the Rastriya Madhesh Samajbadi Party, led by Sarat Singh Bhandari; the Tarai Madhesh Sadbhawana Party, led by Mahendra Yadav’ the Sadbhawana Party, led by Rajendra Mahato; the Madheshi Janadhikar Ganatantrik Party, led by Raj Kishor Yadav; and Anil Jha’s Nepal Sadbhawana Party merged to form the Rastriya Janata Party before the 2017 general and provincial elections.The Rastriya Janata Party and the Nepal Sanghiya Samajbadi Party led by Upendra Yadav fought the 2017 elections with a tie-up in Madhesh but merged the parties in 2020 to form the Janata Samajbadi Party. When the erstwhile prime minister KP Sharma Oli issued an ordinance to split the Yadav-led party to counterbalance a rift within his Nepal Communist Party (NCP) formed after the merger of the CPN-UML and the CPN (Maoist Centre) following the 2017 election, the merger in the two Madhesh-based parties was hastened. Before this, the only Madheshi party to hold the general convention periodically was the Nepal Sadbhawana Party. Gajendra Narayan Singh, who formed the Nepal Sadbhabana Council in 1985, turned the council into a party following the first people’s movement of 1990.Yadav’s will be another Madhesh-based party to hold the general convention more than once, Suman said.Article 269 (4) (B) of the constitution mandates a political party to hold its general convention at least once in five years. However, if the office bearers cannot be elected in five years due to a situation arising out of special circumstances, based on the statute of a political party, new leaders can be elected within six months thereafter. The constitutional time frame is not mandatory for a new party or one formed after a split. As Nepal’s regional parties often suffer splits, they rarely hold the general convention periodically.The Upendra Yadav-led Madheshi Janadhikar Forum (MJF) held its second convention in 2009, in Birgunj, just after the first Constituent Assembly election in 2008. The MJF was a rights-based organisation before it entered politics after the first Madhesh uprising of 2007. JSP-Nepal spokesperson Suman said Yadav has led various political parties, but this is the second time an outfit he leads is holding the general convention.The Bijaya Kumar Gachhadar-led Madhesi Janadhikar Forum (Loktantrik) held its first general convention in Biratnagar in May 2016. The same year, Nepal Sadbhawana Party also held its general conventions in April.The JSP-Nepal has invited foreign dignitaries to the unity convention. The party's foreign affairs department chief, Arjun Thapa, said delegates from India, Malaysia, Azerbaijan, Spain, and Indonesia have already arrived in Nepal.Invitations have been extended to various parties, except the Janata Samajbadi Party led by Ashok Rai, which splintered from the JSP-Nepal. The Nepali Congress, the UML, the Maoist Centre, the Rastriya Swatantra Party, the Rastriya Prajantra Party, and the CPN (Unified Socialist) are other parties that will participate in the Janakpur convention. Party leaders say the opening ceremony will be held on Monday, whereas the closed session, which will discuss the party’s political documents, is scheduled for the subsequent days. \nNepali Congress General Secretary Gagan Thapa has joined the group of leaders calling for a constitutional amendment in order to address the underperforming provincial system and the political instability allegedly caused by the mixed electoral system the country constitutionally endorsed nearly a decade ago. After a change in coalition at the centre began to affect provincial governments, voices for reforming the electoral system through constitutional amendment are growing louder. Speaking at a programme in Kathmandu on Saturday, Thapa, a general secretary of the largest party in the House of Representatives, argued that reforming the electoral system had become necessary to ensure political stability. He also said that the provinces’ performance so far shows that the federal system cannot be sustained in its current form. “By reform in the provincial structure, I do not mean scrapping the federal system altogether, which the country cannot afford,” Thapa told the Post when asked to explain his statement. “The issue of governments’ formation in the provinces has been challenged in court. This is a result of lack of clarity on provincial government formation in the constitution.”The government formation process in Koshi and Gandaki provinces have been challenged multiple times, and the Supreme Court has many times invalidated the chief ministerial appointment and election processes in the two provinces.Questions have been raised over the expenditures for running the provincial governments. “To address this issue, we need to downsize the elected representatives’ bodies not only in the provinces but also at the federal level. For that, we need constitutional reform,” Thapa added. “We bear a collective responsibility to protect and sustain the constitution. This, however, requires some amendments. Reform in the electoral system is as important,” Thapa emphasised. The provinces followed the same process of government formation practised at the centre and that caused problems, he said. Thapa stressed that amendments to the constitution could address all these issues.The Congress leader says it is wrong to advocate either for scrapping the federal system altogether or and fully retaining the constitutional provisions on the provinces. The Rastriya Prajantara Party, which bats for the revival of the Hindu Kingdom, has been demanding the scrapping of the country’s federal structure. The Rastriya Swatantra Party, which was formed two years ago, also wants the provincial structure overhauled. The new party says it wants to downsize the middle layer of the federal system. The party hasn’t participated in the provincial elections.Former National Assembly member Khim Lal Devkota, who is also an expert on federalism and a columnist at The Post, sees a slim chance of any changes in the federal system even though “it is necessary”.“I have closely worked with Nepal’s top political leaders. I believe they won’t readily amend the constitution,” Devkota told the Post. “The longer we take to amend the constitution, the more questions there will be on the longevity of the constitution.” During the Congress Mahasamiti meeting held in February, many leaders raised their voices in favour of filling all seats of the lower house of the federal parliament through direct election. Instead of electing a section of the lower house under the Proportional Representation (PR) system, the leaders had suggested that the upper house of the parliament be filled exclusively through the PR system. They were of the view that Nepal would not have a stable government unless all the lower house members were directly elected by their constituencies.Devkota is also of the opinion that Nepal needs to reform the election system. The mixed electoral system should be changed to create an environment for political instability, he said.In the 275-strong federal lower house, 165 are directly elected, whereas 110 come from the PR category. The upper chamber has 59 members. Of them, 56 are chosen through an electoral college comprising provincial assembly members and the chiefs and deputy chiefs of local units. Each province elects eight members, while three are appointed by the President on the recommendation of the Council of Ministers.Likewise, among the 550 members in the seven provincial assemblies, 220 are elected under the PR category. This number is large compared to the population size and thus needs to be reduced significantly, say experts.However, Krishna Pokharel, a professor of political science, blames the political leaders for the current problems of the provinces. Top politicians are using provincial governments and assemblies to place their second- and third-tier leaders. This has burdened the state without yielding any tangible results, he added. Pokharel says this represents a failure of the leadership rather than the federal system.Since the inception of the provincial system, political parties have appointed chief ministers on a rotational basis, Pokharel told the Post. “It is true that there are operational problems in the provinces, but leaders are more responsible for this than the system.” Even though the state structure is federal, political parties have yet to adopt the three-tier system within their organisations, he said. “What stops the political parties from giving autonomy to their provincial committees and letting them make decisions regarding the provinces on their own?” Pokharel questioned.Devkota, however, said two models should be considered to ensure the stability of provincial governments.The first involves distributing the government leadership positions based on the number of seats won in the election, and the second concerns implementing provisions similar to those at the local government level. According to the first model, the chief minister and other positions are distributed based on the number of seats shared in the provincial assembly elections, and the government is run among the constituent parties on a consensus basis.As per the second method, the chief minister is directly elected by voters, similar to the election of mayors or chairs at the local units. This makes the chief ministers fully accountable to the people. The chief minister can be removed by a two-thirds majority of the provincial assembly, thus preventing one from being an autocrat. One of the major concerns is the destabilising linkage of provincial politics with the power equation in Kathmandu. When the coalition at the centre changes, governments in the provinces also change.The subnational governments changed immediately after the change in coalition partners in Kathmandu on March 4. When Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal changed ruling partners, the second-largest party in the House of Representatives, CPN-UML, joined the government while the largest force, the Congress, was ousted from power. The changes at the centre immediately triggered changes in the provinces as well. \nPolice on Friday arrested two people from Thimi of Bhaktapur for allegedly mining cryptocurrency.The Central Investigation Bureau took 50-year-old Biswas Gurung and Rajendra Tahamata, 25, into custody in connection with the crime, said Hobindra Bogati, spokesperson for the bureau.The duo allegedly ran mining operations from the CTEVT’s information technology lab using a server and 64 desktops, on which blockchain applications were found during a preliminary investigation. Further investigation into the matter is underway. \nThe Central Investigation Bureau has arrested three individuals on charges of embezzlement of over Rs74 million of the Kathmandu-based Square Savings and Credit Cooperative.Those arrested include cooperative chair Basudev Man Joshi, 66, of Kathmandu Metropolitan City-14; secretary Subarna Selalik, 67, of Kathmandu-25; and member Dharma Ratna Pachhai, 58, of Kathmandu-26.Superintendent of Police Hobindra Bogati, who is also the spokesperson for the CIB, said they were arrested on Friday. On Sunday, Kathmandu District Court remanded them for a week for further investigation.According to him, the cooperative operators have been accused of luring depositors with the promise of attractive interest rates but failing to return their deposits. \nDays after Kathmandu Mayor Balendra Shah joined the Nepali Congress in accusing CPN-UML chair KP Sharma Oli in a multi-billion-rupee failed land swap bid in Jhapa, lawmakers from the main opposition have backed Shah in his initiative to expand the sidewalks at New Road—something the UML opposes.Speaking in the House of Representatives on Thursday, Congress General Secretary Bishwo Prakash Sharma backed the mayor's plan to expand pedestrian lanes at New Road that clashed with the vision of the Road Division, led by a UML minister, to widen the roads instead. Lawmaker Sharma said that in case of conflict between a central agency and a local unit, the federal government should show more restraint than the local government.“Mayor Balendra Shah’s initiative to widen pavements at New Road is the right step for the general public’s convenience,” Sharma told the House. “Mayor Shah should be allowed to continue his work without any interference as what he is doing is absolutely right.”The conflict escalated when the Road Division, under the federal government, intervened and paved the road cut by the metropolis on Monday. The metropolis had cleared stretches a few metres wide on either side of the road to create space for pavements. The dispute resulted in a standoff between those deployed by the Road Division and the Kathmandu municipal staff, with different people taking different sides. The tension eased without any untoward incident as the metropolis backed off after the federal government deployed police at the site.The Road Division, under the Ministry of Physical Infrastructure and Transport, is led by Deputy Prime Minister Raghubir Mahaseth, who is a UML secretary. The dispute grew to involve those supporting Mayor Shah and the UML, the biggest partner in the Pushpa Kamal Dahal-led coalition, and also spilled over to social media.In Parliament, lawmakers from the main opposition Nepali Congress threw their weight behind Shah.Not only the party’s general secretary Sharma, two other lawmakers from the party also expressed their support for the mayor in the House meeting on Thursday. Congress lawmaker Arjun Narsingh KC said the conflict between the federal government and the Kathmandu mayor has raised serious questions about the federal government’s intent. KC stressed that cooperation and collaboration between the federal, provincial, and local governments is essential in avoiding conflict and resolving disputes between the three federal units. He said Articles 232 and 235 of the constitution and related schedules clearly define their jurisdictions.“The recent conflict between the federal and local governments and the saga of making and breaking of a road section have raised serious questions,” KC said. He urged the government not to resort to violence and to resolve the issue in a rational way.Another Congress lawmaker, Kanti Sejuwal, also speaking in the zero hour of Parliament, questioned the government for clashing with the municipal authority. “Either we should scrap the Local Government Operation Act 2017, or the federal government should let Balendra work.”As the Road Division intervened in Mayor Shah’s plan to widen the pavement in the New Road area, Sejuwal had expressed his anger at UML chair Oli.Following the federal agency’s intervention, the mayor wrote on social media, alleging Oli’s involvement in the attempted illegal swapping of land at the Birtamode-based Giri Bandhu Tea Estate worth billions of rupees. The largest party, the Congress, had been accusing the UML chief of being complicit in the land swap issue.A few days ago, Shah also engaged in a heated exchange with the KMC’s Ward 22 chairman Chinkaji Maharjan, a UML member, over the sidewalk expansion. Even before that, municipal staff dumped a truckload of dirt and trash outside the Kathmandu Road Division office, claiming that the delayed road expansion work from Kalanki to Maharajgunj had inconvenienced the public.Earlier, on May 14, the Congress parliamentary party meeting had decided to raise the issue of the tea estate land in Parliament. The Oli government, formed after the 2017 general elections, allowed the owners of the tea estate to swap 343.19 bighas (232.43 hectares) of land it occupied, based on a revision to the Land Act (1964). The Act was revised in January 2020, under the Oli administration, introducing a provision for allowing a swap or selling of land to pay off the tea estate’s liabilities if it went into liquidation. Asked if the Congress had backed the mayor as he alleged the UML chair Oli’s involvement in the Tea Estate land scam, the Congress publicity department head Min Bahadur Bishwokarma denied it. “Party lawmakers including the general secretary must have backed the mayor as the New Road sidewalk issue is of public concern, and not necessarily because it involves the UML,” Bishwokarma said. \nDead bodies of a man and a woman were found on a cliff in Dakshinkali Municipality-8, located on the southern outskirts of Kathmandu.According to the Kathmandu Valley Police Office, the bodies were spotted approximately 200 metres down the hill from the Kathmandu-Dakshinkali road.Senior Superintendent of Police Dinesh Raj Mainali said that the preliminary investigation suggests they died in an accident, as a crashed motorcycle was found near the bodies.Mainali said a disaster management team of Nepal Police is working to retrieve the bodies from the hill. He said locals informed the police after spotting the bodies on Wednesday evening.The police said the deceased woman is a 32-year-old resident of Changunarayan Municipality-5, while the man is yet to be identified. \nWith the monsoon just around the corner, the Kathmandu Metropolitan City has finally started repairing the Sisdole road that leads to the Bancharedanda landfill in Nuwakot district. Officials said they started fixing potholes, concreting and other works on Wednesday.“We have allocated Rs30 million for the repairs, and the work started on Wednesday after completing the tender process,” said Rabinman Shrestha, chief of the Environment Department of the Kathmandu Metropolitan City (KMC). “We have asked the contractor to complete the work at the earliest in view of the looming monsoon.”Every year, garbage disposal is affected during the monsoon season due to rain, landslides, and poor road conditions. Sometimes, garbage disposal is disrupted due to obstructions by the residents living in settlements near and around the landfill site. These obstructions result in a complete halt in door-to-door garbage collection for weeks, leading locals in the Valley to discard their trash on the streets and causing chaos in the city.“We are aware of the risks associated with obstructions in garbage disposal and their consequences,” said Shrestha. “We have been taking measures accordingly to lessen all possible risks.”The metropolis said that around 200 metres of road near the Sisdole area, which is often damaged by garbage trucks and excavators, will be concretised.Meteorologists in Nepal anticipate the onset of monsoon by the end of next week, a few days ahead of the usual June 13 arrival of the weather system from the Bay of Bengal.KMC is also considering purchasing a high-pressure pump to prevent the overflow of leachate from the dumping ground. Recently, locals in the Sisdole area protested and stopped the trucks from disposing of garbage alleging the KMC’s negligence in leachate control.Municipal officials said that the Ministry of Urban Development took away a high-pressure pumpset from the landfill site's leachate pond some three months ago for maintenance, but has yet to return it. Landfill leachate is a hazardous liquid containing harmful bacteria, chemicals and other components. It forms when rainwater passes through a landfill or when organic matter decomposes naturally.Officials say the leachate needs to be re-injected into the landfill, which quickens the decomposition process of the landfill waste and prevents the liquid from flowing into the river. The city office has also started segregating degradable and bio-non-degradable waste materials from households in its seven wards. Wards 5, 7, 10, 12, 24 and 27 have been segregating the waste materials generated in the households. The city office has also arranged separate trucks for collecting segregated waste materials from the households.Degradable waste materials are being turned into compost at the KMC’s waste transfer station. Officials said that the metropolis has also been using reagents to expedite the compost-making process.Waste segregation at the source was one of the measures Mayor Balendra Shah touted as a solution to Kathmandu’s chronic garbage problem. After he assumed office, Shah asked city residents to start segregating waste at the source. They started doing so, using separate bins in their homes. But the plan didn’t work, largely due to a lack of preparations on the KMC’s part.The Kathmandu Valley generates over 1,200 tonnes of solid waste every day, nearly 60 percent of which comes from the KMC alone. Experts say 60 percent of organic waste originating in the Valley can be converted into compost and the remaining 30 percent of non-degradable waste can be recycled. \nNepal Oil Corporation has reduced the prices of petroleum products, effective from Saturday midnight. The price of petrol has been cut by Rs3 while diesel and kerosene have also become cheaper by Re1 each. Consumers will now have to pay Rs165 for a litre of petrol and Rs152 for a litre of diesel and kerosene in Kathmandu, Pokhara and Dipayal. Likewise, petrol will now cost Rs164 and diesel and kerosene Rs151 per litre in Surkhet and Dang. It will cost Rs162.50 for petrol and Rs149.50 for diesel and kerosene in Charaali, Biratnagar, Janakpur, Amlekhgunj, Bhalwari, Nepalgunj, Dhangadhi and Birgunj. \nThailand is on the brink of becoming the ultimate destination for the LGBTQIA+ community, thanks to its welcoming environment and the recent launch of the Pink Plus Economy initiative.This revolutionary move, announced on June 9 by Borderless.lgbt, aims to create a supportive ecosystem for LGBTQIA+ individuals in Thailand, encompassing living, family planning, and retirement.According to the reports, Thailand Privilege, a state-owned enterprise dedicated to long-term visas, backs the initiative. The support for the Pink Plus Economy is bolstered by Thailand’s National Legislative Assembly’s recent legalisation of same-sex marriage and upcoming policies favouring LGBTQIA+ family planning.If the legislation is approved by the Senate, Thailand will join Taiwan and Nepal as the only Asian nations to permit same-sex marriage.According to the report, Thailand is ready to welcome more than 200 million LGBTQIA individuals from around the world to wed, live, play, innovate, plan a family and retire in the country.Borderless.lgbt, supported by Thailand Privilege, will offer a series of \"Pink Plus\" membership packages with multi-merchant offerings, including a Thailand Privilege card, a state-of-the-art immersive telemedicine platform with renowned medical experts, shopping vouchers, retirement living programmes and pink tech innovation workshops.Other facilities are family wellness support, dedicated financial planning services, home buying/leasing support and exclusive resort staycations, which will be rolled out for distribution via global resellers. “We are very excited to be part of the journey of how Thailand transforms itself to be a global Diversity, Equality and Inclusion (DE&I) hub. Living in Thailand can now come with inclusive lifestyle, wellness and innovation,” says Manatase Annawat, president of Thailand Privilege.Interested resellers can apply to undertake a training course at www.borderless.lgbt. The successful trainee who passes the training and DE&I assessment will be awarded a certificate of attendance which will entitle him/her the right to distribute selected \"Pink Plus\" packages in accordance with the assessment scores.A high-tech call centre with a soundproof concierge suite is also established in the heart of the trendiest precinct, Thonglor, in cosmopolitan Bangkok to serve the “Pink Plus” members. \nThe 21st replenishment meeting of the International Development Association (IDA21) is scheduled to be held in Kathmandu on June 18.Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal will deliver a keynote address at the opening session of the four-day meeting.The session will be led by the co-chairs of the IDA21 replenishment—World Bank Senior Managing Director Axel van Trotsenburg and Sheku Sambadeen Sesay, the IDA21 Independent Co-Chair.Faris Hadad-Zervos, the World Bank country director for Maldives, Nepal, and Sri Lanka, said the major event, to be held in Kathmandu for the first time, will bring more than 200 IDA delegates representing both donors and recipients.IDA is the part of the World Bank that invests in the future of people and the planet, with projects across 75 countries. Established in 1960, IDA aims to reduce poverty by providing grants and zero- to low-interest loans for programmes that boost economic growth, reduce inequalities, and improve people’s living conditions.Replenishing IDA’s resources will be a key topic of the meeting, which comes at the midpoint of a funding cycle concluding in December 2024—when donors commit to contributions for July 2025 to June 2028.The June 18 session kicks off four days of closed-door meetings to discuss IDA21’s proposed focus areas, assess the financing needs of countries supported by IDA, and consider financing scenarios.The overarching theme for IDA21 is ‘ending poverty on a livable planet: delivering impact with urgency and ambition’.To fulfil this, the IDA21 policy package will have five focus areas: people, planet, prosperity, infrastructure and digitalisation, supported by four lenses of gender, jobs, fragility, conflict and violence, and private investments. The current replenishment (IDA20) ends on June 30, 2025.The target, or a narrow range of scenarios, for the pledging session, is typically agreed upon at the fourth replenishment meeting in October. IDA21 resources will be available for commitments for a three-year period starting July 1, 2025, through June 30, 2028.IDA will continue to provide special support for countries affected by fragility, conflict, and violence and utilise windows to provide additional resources specific to key thematic priorities, such as crisis response, addressing regional challenges, and providing blended finance for private sector investments in IDA countries, among others.“IDA is scaling up its market share significantly, also enabling co-financing and coordinating donor resources to maximise impact. IDA is a transparent, accountable, and cost-effective platform that delivers results, making it a prime investment for global development finance. So you can get a sense of how important this meeting is,” said Hadad-Zervos.He said that Nepal's development story is original. “It is one of economic transformation in the face of various challenges. It faced almost every challenge that a country could face—conflict, earthquakes, Covid, climate crisis, floods, and many others.”“This confluence has put Nepal's development gains at risk. Yet Nepal is a very resilient country. And despite these challenges, it has achieved significant development progress,” he said.Shree Krishna Nepal, joint-secretary at the finance ministry, said that the World Bank Group’s first economic mission to Nepal was in 1963 to assess the country's developing prospects and challenges. The group approved its first credit in 1969 for a telecommunications project that continues to be transformative today.Since then, IDA has provided Nepal with $6 billion in credits and grants. Currently, the World Bank is supporting 24 projects worth $2.3 billion. The World Bank said IDA is also helping transform the lives of millions of Nepalis through investments in education, health, jobs and skills, connectivity and infrastructure, social protection, food security, and others.A robust IDA 21 replenishment will ensure that IDA countries continue to benefit from it and that IDA continues its decades-long track record of lifting millions of people out of poverty, providing quality education for children, ensuring access to health services, and creating jobs so that people in low-income countries can become self-sustainable and living, according to the multilateral funding agency. \nChildren aged between five and 11 years with compromised immunity will be administered the Covid vaccine, according to health officials.The Covax facility, the United Nations-backed international vaccine-sharing scheme, has agreed to provide 100,000 doses of the children’s vaccine, and supply will start in the last week of June, according to officials at the Ministry of Health and Population.“These 100,000 doses are part of the 2.5 million doses, which Covax had agreed to supply to Nepal in 2024,” said Dr Abhiyan Gautam, chief of the Immunisation Section at the Family Welfare Division under the Department of Health Services. “Children between five and 11 having underlying conditions—cancer, HIV, and others will be administered the vaccine.”Last month, Nepal confirmed the spread of the Covid sub-lineages KP.1, KP.2, KP.3, and KP.4 in the country. All the sub-variants are offshoots of the Omicron variant, which is considered responsible for the surge in new Covid cases in the last few months.Hospitals in Kathmandu had reported a surge in serious cases of Covid infection in April. Doctors attending the infected patients had said that elderly people and those with underlying conditions were getting severe.The Covax facility supplied millions of doses of various brands of the coronavirus vaccine, which were used to inoculate the majority of the country's population.Officials said that Nepal will receive 1.6 million doses of Pfizer-BioNTech monovalent vaccine by the end of this month, including the children’s vaccine, from Covax. The rest of the doses of the monovalent vaccine to be received later will be administered to the adult population in all provinces of the country. The monovalent or single component is designed for the Omicron variant XBB.1.5 of SARS-CoV-2.Earlier, the facility used to supply Pfizer-BioNTech bivalent vaccine doses that included a component of the original virus strain as well as a part of the Omicron variant to provide broad protection against Covid.The vaccine is called a bivalent Covid shot as it contains two components: the original virus strain and Omicron BA.4 and BA.5 sub-variants.Over 12,000 people died, and hundreds of thousands were infected in the first, second and third waves of the Covid pandemic. \nAt least one case of cholera, a highly contagious and potentially fatal disease, has been confirmed in Kathmandu.According to the Sukraraj Tropical and Infectious Disease Hospital, a 62-year-old man from Makwanpur district, who had been admitted with severe diarrhoea some two weeks ago, tested positive for the deadly disease.The man is said to have been residing in Kathmandu for a long time.“The health condition of the patient was serious when he was brought to our hospital,” said a health worker serving at the Hospital’s Emergency Department, asking not to be named, as the official was not authorised to speak to the media. “The stool test confirmed a cholera infection.”According to health workers at the hospital, Vibrio cholera 01 Ogawa serotype has been confirmed in stool samples of infected patients.Cholera is a highly infectious disease that causes severe diarrhoea and vomiting, which causes dehydration and can lead to death within a few hours if left untreated. The World Health Organisation says cholera is a global threat to public health and an indicator of inequality and a lack of social development.The Kathmandu Valley witnessed a massive cholera outbreak in the monsoon of 2022 in which 77 cholera-positive cases were confirmed. Hundreds of people suffered from diarrheal infections that continued for months.Experts say an outbreak of cholera in Kathmandu Valley before the onset of the monsoon is concerning, as rainwater contaminates most water resources, increasing the risk of more people getting infected from water-borne diseases including cholera. “More people could have been infected with cholera, as not all cases become severe and not all patients do not go to the hospital for treatment,” said Dr Sher Bahadur Pun, chief of the Clinical research unit at the Sukraraj Hospital. “Many patients buy medicines from nearby pharmacies to recover at home. Only serious cases end up in hospitals.”Meanwhile, officials at the Health Office Kathmandu said that they are unaware of any confirmed cholera cases in the district. “We don’t have information about a cholera outbreak in recent days,” said Dr Arjun Sapkota, chief of the Health Office in Kathmandu. “We are the agency responsible for investigating the causes of outbreaks of deadly diseases, and as of today (Friday) we don’t have such information.”Sapkota informed that one case of cholera infection was reported from Sitapaila in Kathmandu about three months ago. An Indian national who is a truck driver was admitted to the Sukraraj Hospital at that time.“We had mobilised our team to investigate the source of the outbreak,” said Sapkota. Doctors warn that concealing outbreaks of deadly diseases such as cholera and failing to investigate their sources and inform the public about the risks can prove counterproductive, as the deadly bacteria keep spreading in communities if preventative measures are not taken.Due to poor sanitation and hygiene conditions, Nepal is highly vulnerable to water-borne diseases including diarrhoea, dysentery, typhoid, hepatitis, and cholera, with thousands of people getting infected with them every year.Doctors say contaminated water and food are the main catalysts for the spread of cholera in the Kathmandu Valley. Last year, health authorities administered an oral cholera vaccine in wards 11, 12, and 13 of the Kathmandu Metropolitan City that were highly affected by the outbreak. In October 2021, a Vibrio cholera outbreak in several local units of Kapilvastu district killed at least four people including three minors—boys aged seven and two, and a five-year-old girl. Another deceased was a 45-year-old man.Following the outbreak, the Health Ministry had launched a mass vaccination drive against the disease after all its attempts failed to curb the infection.The World Health Organisation says that a multifaceted approach is key to controlling cholera and reducing deaths.Doctors say launching awareness drives against water-borne diseases and ensuring safe drinking water are the only ways to save people from dying of water-borne diseases, including cholera.A combination of careful survey, ensuring safe drinking water, maintaining sanitation and hygiene, social mobilisation, and treatment is required to contain the spread of the infection, according to doctors. \nPost-monsoon is considered the dengue epidemic season. However, most districts in the country have already reported outbreaks of the deadly disease even before the onset of monsoon.Public health experts have warned of a massive outbreak of the potentially deadly virus in the coming days, as the monsoon is just around the corner, and authorities are not doing much to prevent outbreaks.“Except counting the number of infected people and releasing statements, not much of substance is being done,” said Dr Baburam Gautam, a public health expert. “The general public has stopped taking such statements on dengue infection seriously.”Dengue is a viral disease transmitted by female Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes. The same vectors also transmit chikungunya, yellow fever, and Zika virus, according to the World Health Organisation.According to data provided by the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division, at least 1,105 people from 69 districts have been infected with the dengue virus since January this year. Among the 69 districts that reported dengue outbreaks, Kathmandu has the highest number of cases: 112. Jhapa district recorded 109 cases, followed by Chitwan (73), Makwanpur (58), Sindhupalchok (44), Tanahun (39), Okhaldhunga (38), Doti (30), Rupandehi (28), and Bhaktapur (27). The three districts of the Valley—Kathmandu, Bhaktapur and Lalitpur—together reported 157 cases of infections in this period.Sindhupalchok, Rasuwa, and Kalikot are among the mountain districts that have reported dengue cases.Public health experts say reported cases could be just the tip of the iceberg, as around 80 percent of those infected are asymptomatic. Many people infected with dengue show mild symptoms and do not need treatment or can be treated with paracetamol at home.Last year, at least 20 persons died, and more than 52,000 were infected by the virus, which had spread to all 77 districts.In 2022, a total of 88 people died and over 54,000 were infected by the virus across the country. At the time, hospitals in the Kathmandu valley were overwhelmed with dengue patients and pharmacies had run out of paracetamol, the most widely used medicine to treat fever.In 2019, the disease killed at least six people and more than 16,000 were hospitalised across the country. The virus had spread to 68 districts at the time.Post-monsoon is considered a highly transmissible season for dengue, but Nepal has witnessed outbreaks of the deadly disease around the year, making the country endemic to the virus.Experts say this is the right time to prepare for and prevent possible outbreaks.Waiting for a massive outbreak would be a big mistake, they say. To reduce the risk, authorities should launch an awareness drive, step up vector surveillance, and take other measures. Health ministry officials said that they have alerted all related agencies to the risk of a dengue outbreak.“Even if massive outbreaks have not been seen in any place, many districts have already reported dengue cases,” said Gokarna Dahal, chief of the Vector Control Section at the division. “We have alerted all relevant agencies to the risk of an outbreak in the coming days.”Authorities and agencies in some local units have launched activities to raise residents' awareness of the risks, and we have urged all health agencies to take preventive measures, Dahal said.Epidemiologists and virologists say the dengue virus has emerged as a major public health issue in Nepal. They also say that despite thousands of people getting infected and scores dying from the disease, the authorities do not take it seriously. They said measures such as search-and-destroy and awareness drives should be initiated to contain the spread of virus-spreading vectors.Dengue-transmitting mosquitoes breed in clean water and bite people in daylight. Uncovered water tanks and discarded objects, such as plastic cups and bottles, could be breeding grounds for these mosquitoes.Symptoms include mild to high fever, severe muscle pain, rashes, severe headache, and pain in the eyes. Patients having these symptoms are advised to seek immediate treatment. While there is no specific cure for the disease, early detection and proper medical care can prevent death. \nSevere heat in the Tarai region has affected ongoing polio vaccination programmes.Officials at the Immunisation Section at the Family Welfare Division under the Department of Health Services say the immunisation campaign has been affected by school closures due to scorching heat.“The immunisation campaign will resume once schools resume their regular classes,” said Dr Abhiyan Gautam, chief of the Immunisation Section. “It will take more time for the campaign to complete due to the severe heat in Tarai districts.”Several districts’ maximum temperatures have either reached close to or crossed 40 degrees Celsius in the last few days. On Tuesday, Dhangadhi recorded 40.4 degrees Celsius, Nepalgunj 40.2 degrees Celsius and Birendranagar 37.3 degrees Celsius, the Met office’s data shows.Met officials anticipate monsoon will start at the end of next week and bring respite from scorching heat.Over 1.46 million children born between April 2016 and October 2018 are being inoculated with inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) in a nationwide immunisation drive started on May 26.Officials said that children who missed the IPV vaccine during the routine immunisation programme will be administered the vaccine, as they are at risk of getting infected with Type-2 polio.Gautam said that vaccination programmes are being carried out smoothly in the rest of the places. The vaccine is being administered in schools, booths and health posts.Nepal has been polio-free since 2010, but the World Health Organisation officially declared it polio-free on March 27, 2014 after maintaining zero polio cases for three consecutive years.After introducing the IPV vaccine in September 2014, the country switched to the bivalent oral poliovirus vaccine (bOPV0) from the trivalent oral poliovirus vaccine (tOPV).The trivalent oral poliovirus vaccine contains all three types of poliovirus: Type-1, Type-2, and Type-3. The current oral poliovirus vaccine is made up of live, attenuated poliovirus.The trivalent poliovirus vaccine was effective against all three types of poliovirus.However, the Type -2 component of this vaccine can lead to the circulation of vaccine-derived viruses. Its use was linked to a vaccine associated with paralytic polio, a condition in which children develop paralysis.Nepal became the first country in the South Asia region to incorporate the IPV vaccine in its routine immunisation programme in line with the UN Health body’s endgame strategic plan to eliminate the risk of vaccine-derived poliovirus and phase out all oral polio vaccines in the routine immunisation programme.IPV consists of inactivated poliovirus strains of all three poliovirus types.Gautam said that due to global shortages of the IPV vaccine, children born between April 13, 2016, and October 18, 2018 were inoculated only with the bivalent oral poliovirus vaccine.“Children who missed the IPV vaccine will be at high risk of poliovirus infection,” Gautam said. “So we are launching a campaign to inoculate them.”Health officials say that children should continuously receive the bivalent poliovirus vaccine, even if they are administered the IPV vaccine, as the bivalent poliovirus vaccine is also necessary for intestinal immunity, while IPV provides mucosal immunity.Childhood immunisation is the number one priority of the government, under which 13 types of vaccines are given against a range of diseases, including measles-rubella, pneumonia, tuberculosis, diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus, hepatitis B, rotavirus, Japanese encephalitis and typhoid under the regular immunisation programme, free of cost.Regular immunisation is one of the most successful programmes in Nepal, with a high coverage rate. The country has demonstrated remarkable progress in reducing the under-five mortality rate and the regular immunisation programme is credited with that.The Nepal Demographic and Health Survey-2022, carried out by the Ministry of Health and Population, however, showed that at least four percent of the children aged between 12 and 23 months received no vaccine at all.This figure was one percent in 2016.The Ministry of Health and Population said that the vaccine coverage rate for polio is 95 throughout the country. \nThe 16th five-year periodic plan, proposed by the National Planning Commission, aims to reduce neonatal deaths to 13 from the existing 21 in every 1,000 live births. Public health experts, however, are sceptical of its success, as neonatal deaths have not declined since 2016, and the measures taken at present are not sufficient to lessen the ongoing death rates.“Both the Nepal Demographic and Health Survey-2022 and the finance ministry’s recent report show neonatal deaths constantly high,” said Dr Shyam Raj Upreti, former director general at the Department of Health Services. “It will not be easy to pick high-hanging fruits. It requires a lot of investments and micro planning, which are currently lacking.”A recent report by the Ministry of Finance shows that 21 neonates die in every 1,000 live births, the same results shown by the Nepal Demographic and Health Survey-2022, carried out by the Ministry of Health and Population.The government’s target for Sustainable Development Goals is to reduce neonatal mortality to 12 deaths per every 1,000 live births by 2030.The SDGs, a follow-up on the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), aim to end poverty, hunger, and all forms of inequality in the world by 2030. Nepal has committed to meeting the goals.The 16th five-year plan, which starts next fiscal year and ends in 2029, is aligned with the SDG targets.Public health experts say meeting the goal is easier said than done. Most health facilities having birthing centres lack neonatal units, trained human resources, and quality services.“Without ensuring quality services, which require trained human resources and advanced facilities, among others, it is impossible to reduce neonatal deaths,” said Upreti. “The government has made various plans to reduce child deaths—including neonatal deaths—but does not pay much attention to their effective implementation.”The finance ministry’s recent report shows that the institutional delivery rate increased to 80 percent from 79 percent last year. The rise in institutional deliveries has contributed to lessening the maternal mortality rate, which is 151 in every 100,000 live births.“Fifty percent of the neonates die in the first 24 hours of birth,” said Dr Abhiyan Gautam, chief of the Immunisation Section at the Family Welfare Division of the Department of Health Services. “Most of our health facilities, including birthing centres, lack proper infrastructures.”Study shows that 85 percent of all deaths among children under the age of five in Nepal take place before a child’s first birthday, with 64 percent occurring during the first month of life.Along with trained human resources, infrastructures and quality services, deaths of neonates are also linked to the antenatal care visit of pregnant women, access to health facilities, timely referral system and others, experts say. The government has been taking various measures to reduce neonatal deaths, including planning to set up a ‘special newborn care unit’ in all district hospitals throughout the country. For that, concerned agencies under the health ministry have imparted training to all doctors, nurses and paramedics serving in Nuwakot, Dhading, Sindhupalchok and Makawanpur district hospitals.Special newborn care units are general units designed to care for newborn children who fall ill shortly after birth. Doctors, nurses, and paramedics monitor ailing children admitted to the unit.The health ministry has installed an underfloor heating system at birthing centres in four mountain districts to curb postpartum and neonatal deaths there.Underfloor heating is a form of central heating that ensures indoor climate control for thermal comfort. It uses an electrical heating cable installed underneath the flooring.Hypothermia, infection, low birth weight, premature birth, and abnormal birth asphyxia are among the leading causes of neonatal deaths, doctors say.Some of the programmes being undertaken to lower child mortality include newborn care, kangaroo care, exclusive breastfeeding, infection prevention, chlorhexidine for umbilical cord care, and free neonatal care. “Whatever the achievements we made so far were achieved by the measures taken as of now,” said Upreti. “The ongoing programme may not achieve further progress. Government must implement the programmes and plans to prevent more deaths.” \nNepali chef Aditya Mishra promotes Nepali cuisine in New York through his supper club, \"The Sewing Tin,\" which blends traditional flavors with modern culinary techniques while highlighting the challenges and opportunities of being an outsider in the competitive culinary scene.\nCeleus Baral, a talented baker and environmental science student, runs Bakeleus, selling a range of baked goods made with local produce and a commitment to sustainability, offering three easy-to-bake recipes for carrot cakes, mulberry fudge cakes, and strawberry casseroles.\nPotato is a widely cultivated and highly nutritious staple crop in Nepal, with a high yield and diverse culinary uses; however, excessive consumption of processed potato products (chips, fries) can lead to health concerns.\nChicken eggs are a healthy, versatile food that provide essential nutrients, promote weight loss, and protect against various health conditions, with Nepal being self-sufficient in egg production.\nPiano Piano South, an Italian restaurant in Lalitpur, offers a garden dining area, a revised menu with a variety of Italian dishes, and a selection of wines, providing a tranquil escape with culinary delights.\nMundhum Trek in Koshi province in the eastern part of Nepal is a new cultural walking trail. It passes through several indigenous ethnic villages and landscapes in Khotang and Bhojpur districts. This trail goes up to an elevation of 4,200 metres to the viewpoint of Silchung Peak and takes one through the settlements of the Kirati people. This route starts from Diktel Bazaar and passes through beautiful settlements like Chakhewa, Rawa Dhap, Salpa Bhanjyang, Silchung and Hanspokhari before ending in Bhojpur. There are some hotels in Diktel but trekkers are advised to carry tents. The trail offers panoramic views of most of the eight-thousanders, including Everest, Lhotse, Makalu, Cho Oyu and Kanchenjunga mountains. The spring season, March through May, is highly recommended for the trek.Janaki Mandir Janaki Mandir at Janakpur in Madhesh province was constructed in 1874 and is a blend of Mughal and local architecture. The temple is a three-storey building and has 60 rooms, making it the largest temple in Nepal. Pilgrims flock here by the thousands to pay homage to Janaki Mandir—Janaki being the other name of Sita, the daughter of King Janak. The temple houses an idol of Sita which was found near Ayodhya, the kingdom of Ram. The marriage anniversary of Lord Ram and Sita is celebrated in Janakpur every year on Vivaha Panchami, which falls in December. In the southwest corner of Janaki Mandir is the Vivaha Mandap, which has been built at the site where the marriage of Ram and Sita is said to have taken place. Another well-known temple in the vicinity is Ram Mandir, which is built in pagoda style and is hence different from the other temples in Janakpur that generally bear resemblance to Mughal architecture. It houses a female statue, said to be of Yogamaya, which has the reputation of being one of the most beautiful images of female forms in Nepal. Other holy sites of interest include the Laxman Temple, Sankat Mochan Temple and Hanuman Temple.Kuri Village, Kalinchok Kuri village, a popular tourist destination around 150 km from Kathmandu, lies at an altitude of 3,842 metres above sea level in Kalinchowk of Dolakha district, in Bagmati province. People visit the place to enjoy the snow during the winter besides the mesmerising landscapes and splendid panoramic view of the Himalayan range. Kalinchok gets snow mainly at the end of December and the snowfall continues till the end of February or mid-March. When there is snow, it is difficult for jeeps, buses and cars to reach the top of Kuri village. Chains are wrapped around the wheels of vehicles and specially modified jeeps with highly experienced drivers are used to carry visitors. There are several hotels and restaurants in the area. The road up to Kuri has also improved over the years.Annapurna Base Camp Annapurna Base Camp trek, in Gandaki province, makes for a picturesque journey that takes you to the foothills of the Annapurna South, up to 4,130 metres above sea level. The five-day trek (seven days for slow walkers) offers rich cultural diversities, typical Nepali villages and the flora and fauna nestled at the foothills of Annapurna. The distance from Pokhara to Annapurna Base Camp is approximately 81 kilometres. It is among the shortest and most budget-friendly treks in Nepal. For Nepalis, lodging costs around $5 to $10 per day. For foreigners, the overall cost of the trek ranges from $800 to $1500 on average per person. Annapurna Base Camp trek can be done at any time throughout the year as each season offers a different trekking experience. The ideal time for the trek depends on your weather preferences and what you expect from it. However, autumn (September to October) and spring (March to May) are considered the two best seasons for the trek, as the days at the time are warm and bright with clear skies.Bardiya National Park Bardiya National Park, located in the southern Tarai belt of Lumbini province, is home to one of the most elusive and majestic animals on earth—the Royal Bengal Tiger. The park, which covers an area of 968 square kilometres, is considered one of the most important protected areas in the country. It is a prime destination for those looking to catch a glimpse of a tiger. A bit of luck and patience will offer a good chance to see the Bengal Tiger. The jungle safari also offers one the opportunity to spot Asian elephants and the greater one-horned rhinoceros. The rare Gangetic river dolphins are occasionally spotted on rafting trips along the Geruwa River, the eastern channel of the Karnali river. Besides, visitors can enjoy the homestays and explore local Tharu culture. The right time to visit the park is from mid-September to mid-December and mid-February to May.Khaptad National Park Khaptad National Park in Sudurpaschim province is a protected area in the far western region. It stretches over four districts of Bajhang, Bajura, Achham and Doti and ranges in elevation from 1,400 to 3,300 metres. The park can be visited throughout the year. Trekkers are advised to bring their tents, food and other supplies. The Nepal Tourism Board says of late, social media has been increasingly influencing Nepali travellers to go to Khaptad. Since the far-flung Khaptad National Park is still offbeat for many travellers, the area remains pristine and fresh. The seasons of spring (March-May) and autumn (October-November) are the ideal times to visit the park. The temperature ranges from 10°c to 20°c offering pleasant trekking weather. The monsoon begins in June and lasts until September and during this time, roads often become muddy and slippery. From December to February, winter brings snow and chilling winds to the park.Limi Valley \nOnce again, my heart swelled with joy when my hometown came into view.Arriving at Lalikharka after the treacherous journey through Pauwa Bhanjyang and the bustling Kanchhi Dokan, Phidim, the headquarters of Panchthar district, revealed itself like a surprise gift. My home town, Phidim, is unique in the fact that it reveals to travellers approaching it from uphill. As the vehicle descends the mountain road, it slowly comes into view, its houses and buildings recognisable for the native son.This Dashain, I undertook the much-awaited trip to my hometown with my wife Kabita and daughter Aarohi. Little did I anticipate the transformation that awaited me.The moment I got out of the jeep, I noticed that Phidim, nestled in the lush hills, has undergone a remarkable transformation over the years. As I guided my family to my home, which had suffered damages in the 1989 quake that struck eastern Nepal, I found that old, mud and stone houses had been replaced by concrete buildings. The place was vastly different from the one I remembered.Arriving at my childhood home felt like reuniting with an old friend. Navigating its nooks and crannies with my daughter, we delved into the history of the house, a symbol of my cherished memories.My wife had visited Phidim years ago, spending a month with my parents. She, too, recalled beautiful moments she had had in the town. I asked the tenant about the neighbours and acquaintances. Some had died, while others had left for good.A call to local journalist Giriraj Banskota led me to the school grounds, where memories flooded back. This was where I spent my teenage years, playing ball, learning to kick, and watching major tournaments. Here, I even encountered a group of Western climbers headed to Kanchenjunga, the world’s third-highest mountain. I remember being awed by their shiny yellow tents, headlights and strange smell. I remember practising my tutephuteko Angrezi with the climbers. Birendra Shield, an annual sports tournament named after the late king, brought ace players from various schools in Panchthar district. The district also hosted Yuba Mela, an annual three-day fair to commemorate the birthday of the king, organising football tournaments in which teams from as far as Sunsari and Taplejung participated. I never excelled at dribbling balls. A boy growing up in a seven-member family, I soon found my interest in literature. In the late 1980s, Phidim hosted a major literary festival. In the run-up to the 1990 pro-democracy protest, walls were painted with anti-monarchy slogans, local politicians were arrested. I took my family to my school, Naya Namuna Secondary School. It was Saturday, so the school was closed. I peeked through the steel gate and wall, imagining myself labouring over classes. Memories are hazy, but what I remember most is going out of the school—to quiz contests with me leading the school team, to essay competitions at the District Education Office and to play carom board, a national pastime, in a nearby shopfront. Returning to the main street, the demolition of a landmark gate made me reflect on how cities transform, shedding old landmarks for new identities. Navigating narrow alleyways, I felt like a stranger in my own hometown. Multistory buildings have emerged and roads have been paved, reshaping the town. It’s the same place with a different face, leaving me nostalgic for the Phidim of my memories.We finally reached Shivalaya temple, which I told my wife and daughter was one of my cherished hangouts. A giant statue of Falgunanda (the Kirant leader’s birthday is celebrated on November 10) stood before the steps to the temple. Though my wife suspected I came here to smoke, in reality, I visited the temple in the evening to meet friends and talk about issues that mattered most to us at the time. It also offered a panoramic view of the town (I could not take my family to Gadhi Danda, a hillock across the Shivalaya).Towards the end of my journey, I felt sad about Phidim’s lack of prospects. To my dismay, I found that people have been leaving the town in droves. Despite blacktopped roads and multi-story buildings, Phidim faces a troubling reality. The lack of quality higher education and specialist healthcare has driven people away, echoing the circumstances that led me to Kathmandu years ago. Conversations with locals confirmed a mass exodus from the town, a trend that raises concerns about Phidim's future.My conversations with familiar strangers led me to conclude that Phidim has transformed into a transit town for pilgrims heading to Pathibhara Devi Temple, which is around 255 kilometres north in Taplejung district. I met dozens of people headed to the holy site. While pilgrims see it as a stopover, for me, it was a homecoming. The realisation dawned that Phidim is, perhaps, in a state of transition, trading its rustic charm for the hallmarks of urbanisation. While I left Phidim for higher education in Kathmandu, people from rural areas have flocked to the town in search of better opportunities, bringing life and energy to the once quiet community.As we bid adieu to my hometown, I couldn’t help but reflect on the inevitability of leaving a place, no matter how enamoured one is with it. Passing Kanchhi Dokan, I pointed out Kanchnajungha and Kumbhakarna to my daughter—symbols of my childhood. Phidim, now a blend of nostalgia and change, remains etched in my heart, a testament to the intricate dance between memory and evolution. \nThe gate leading inside the city of Lucknow proudly declares, “Muskuraiye aap Lucknow mein hain” (Smile because you are in Lucknow). During my brief stay, the city lived upto its promise. Known as the city of Nawabs, with a rich history going centuries back, the city is abuzz with autos, rickshaws, honks of public buses and the constant loud sounds of the metro going over your head, irritable honks of public buses and food that leaves you wanting more.In such a happening place stands Bara Imambara, built in 1784 by Asaf-ud-Daula. ‘Bara’ means big, and ‘Imambara’ is a building with a big hall where people assemble for mourning congregations. This building was originally built to provide employment for the public because, at that period, the country was going through a famine, and it was seen as a relief project. I walked through the grand entrance gate known as Rumi Darwaza (Turkish Gate), wiping my sweat and fighting the Lucknow heat, entering the vast complex. Echoing in all corners was a voice from the speaker that kept reminding the visitors of the many rules inside the historical place. I tried not to let the wonder overwhelm me as I walked through the complex. To my right stood the elegant Asafi Mosque, recently painted in cream-like white. Its design is visually pleasing and a testament to the Mughal era’s artistic finesse. Its walls are adorned with intricate calligraphy and elegant designs, reminiscent of a time when such aesthetics held great importance. I couldn’t help but admire the tremendous effort the craftsmen put into bringing the Nawab’s vision to life, meticulously crafting the elegant domes which seemed to touch the sky. The mosque’s serene atmosphere stands in stark contrast to the bustling city just beyond its walls.Upon stepping into the main hall—known as Asafi Hall—I was immediately struck by its sheer size. It is vast and impressive, appearing to stretch into eternity, and its massive arched roof seemed to defy gravity. What’s even more intriguing is that it stands without the support of pillars or beams. The interlocking system of bricks, a hidden secret, upholds this colossal structure, leaving one in awe of the brilliance of the builders of the past.This very hall houses a large vaulted central chamber with the tomb of Asaf-ud-Daula. Standing beside his tomb was a chilling moment, knowing that the remains of a great historical figure was resting just a few feet below. After scanning the large hall, the guide took me to my favourite part of the Imambara—the labyrinth or the Bhool Bhulaiyaa. This labyrinth sits right above the main hall, and because the hall is unsupported, the ceiling had to be lightweight, so the hollow labyrinth was born. It is quite impossible to figure out the Bhool Bhulaiyaa on your own, as it is a confusing network of corridors and staircases. So, it is necessary to have the company and guidance of a guide.As I moved with my guide through the maze, I thought I could feel the presence of the past inhabitants who had walked through these confusing passageways. What fascinated me most was the maze’s design: every sound, no matter how faint, echoed through the structure, enhancing its aura of mystery.The guide whispered from a distance, his head close to the wall, and the sound reached my ears, even though he was out of sight. It felt as if the walls carried the whispers. We exchanged astonished glances. When the guide reappeared, he smiled and remarked, “Now, you understand why they say that walls have ears.”Exiting the maze, I climbed to the roof, which offered a breathtaking view of Lucknow. The city spread out in front of me, its modern skyline contrasting the monument’s historic charm. It was a moment of reflection, contemplating how centuries had passed, and yet, Bara Imambara stood as a timeless witness to the changing tides of history. As I stood there, taking it all in, I felt recharged by the air coming in from all directions. After descending from the terrace, my brisk guide led me to the final stop in the Imambara, Shahi Baoli (Stepwell). Also referred to as the royal stepwell, it sits underground and is another example of architectural brilliance in the complex. This didn’t surprise me much since it was built at a time when architecture wasn’t just functional but also a work of art.The moment I descended the steps that led me underground, I noticed the sudden drop in temperature. The Shahi Baoli served as a cool refuge during the blistering summer day. The well-planned architecture of the Baoli allowed it to naturally regulate its temperature. The way to the main well is locked, but visitors can throw coins through jail-like doors into the well in order to try out their luck, much like we do in Davis Falls in Pokhara.Entering the underground corridors, I felt a slight chill because it was cold and dimly lit. I turned on my phone’s flashlight and saw the walls adorned with intricate Mughal carvings. Upon reaching a spot where we could see the well, the guide informed us that the well acted as a CCTV camera at the time. He explained that individuals inside the structure could discreetly observe those entering, as their reflections would be visible on the well’s water, but the people entering could not see the people inside the building.I waited to see that happen, and when a group entered through the gate, I was stunned; their faces were perfectly mirrored on the water’s surface, showcasing the ingenuity behind the well’s design, serving both as a water source and a security measure.My experience at Bara Imambara was a delightful one. I had never seen such a remarkable work of architecture before—it is beautiful, interesting and ahead of its time. \nSerene, snow-capped mountains set against the bluest skies. It’s a heavenly sight in pictures but mighty hard to climb in real life. Climbing Everest, Annapurna, or Manaslu means enduring freezing cold, biting air, and days of physical and mental strain until you reach the summit. The journey is a slippery path of rocks, rivers, and bridges, navigated skillfully by experienced trekkers, locals, and guides. In 2022, Nepal welcomed 15,781 trekkers, highlighting the importance of climbing and trekking guides for the country's economy.For new trekkers, understanding the trek can be confusing. If you’re anxious about missing something in your backpack or need motivation to start a trek, here are tips from two seasoned guides to help you grasp the essentials.Meet Luckme Syangden, a 25-year-old climbing guide with extensive experience in the treacherous heights of Everest. According to Syangden, maintaining a positive mindset is the first step towards a successful climb, both before and throughout the entire process.Preparation for the journeyTrekking is undeniably demanding, both physically and mentally. However, maintaining a ‘can-do’ attitude can go a long way in pushing people to their destination, says Syangden. “We never force the people to push through if we think they’ve reached their limits, but we do try to use ourselves as an example to show that they can,” says Syangden. According to Syangden, when you’re guiding so many people through the process of climbing, you realise that everybody is different; their bodies have different needs and limitations. So it’s important to move forward while assessing their physical and mental well-being. “We always maintain a strong, positive mindset ourselves and strive to inspire our trekkers with the same optimism. Rushing them when they’re unwell isn’t our approach,” says Syangden.Manu Rai, 32, has been a trekking guide for three years. Her passion for physical activities and exploring the vast landscapes of her village led her to this profession. Rai, an avid walker and traveller, found her calling when she met fellow adventure enthusiasts who shared her love for hiking and trekking. According to Rai, engaging in physical activities and regular workouts can significantly enhance the strength needed for embarking confidently on a trek.For novice trekkers, it’s advisable to begin preparing at least a month prior to the trek. Joining a gym or engaging in physical activities like walking can make a significant difference. Start with a 20-minute walk on the first day and gradually extend the duration as the trek approaches. This gradual increase helps in building strength, endurance, and confidence. Additionally, regular stretching is essential to loosen the muscles, reducing the risk of injuries while navigating challenging terrains. Personally, I've found going to the gym and incorporating squats into my routine immensely beneficial in strengthening my leg muscles. Backpacking essentialsWhen backpacking, packing wisely is key. Rai advises opting for light yet warm clothing instead of bulky jackets to reduce the load. She recommends essentials like down jackets, caps, goggles, sunglasses, sunscreen, a stick, warmer, gloves, socks, and sturdy boots. Syangden, who also carries the same essentials, stresses the importance of carrying a safety knife and period supplies for female trekkers.Managing periods during treksManaging periods during treks can be challenging, as Syangden points out. “I carry all of the supplies that I need, but as you can imagine, handling period cramps and all the other symptoms while trekking through gruelling mountains is no easy task. I just do my best to power through it all,” says Syangden.Handling altitude sickness and injuriesRai advises trekkers to rest and wait if altitude sickness strikes. Carrying painkillers and paracetamol is essential. If conditions worsen, trekkers can choose to halt their trip. In such cases, communication with fellow travellers and guides is key. Guides can also arrange transportation for the trekker’s return if needed. Effective communication with trekkers and guidesSyangden highlights the importance of communication and building positive relationships with fellow trekkers. Over her journey from being a beginner to a seasoned guide, she has learned that talking and fostering a friendly rapport with clients significantly smoothens the trek.“In my initial guiding days, communication was tough, but now I can confidently lead trekking groups,” Syangden states.Challenges faced by a female trekkersBoth Syangden and Rai acknowledge the challenges faced by female trekkers. They often encounter underestimation and demeaning comments questioning their trekking abilities. Syangden has personally dealt with such remarks, reflecting a wider issue where being a woman is wrongly linked to an inability to handle the physical demands of trekking. Becoming a trekking guideTrekkers and adventure-seekers may come to the realisation that their love for the mountains and hills can translate itself to a profession that not only supports their own passion but also that of those enthusiastic about the secrets of the mountains. According to both Syangden and Rai, the first step is to connect with a trekking association and enrol in a trekking guide course. Rai explains that this course covers essential skills like map reading, navigation, guiding techniques, geography, safety measures, and environmental knowledge.Additionally, Syangden, who is currently undergoing a climbing course, mentions that colleges now offer bachelor’s programmes in mountaineering, providing a comprehensive education for aspiring guides. \nFive young women established Duluwa Outdoors in 2021 to encourage female travel in Nepal, providing a platform for shared experiences, empowering solo travel, and offering safety tips for women exploring Nepal's diverse destinations.\nGermany thrashed 10-man Scotland 5-1 on Friday with three goals in the first half to make a triumphant start to their Euro 2024 campaign and lay down a marker with the biggest opening game margin of victory in the tournament’s history.The Germans, hunting a record fourth European title and first major trophy after a barren decade, scored through Florian Wirtz, Jamal Musiala and a Kai Havertz penalty before Niclas Fuellkrug and Emre Can added two more late in the second half.Scotland, who had defender Ryan Porteous sent off on the stroke of halftime, got on the scoresheet in the 87th minute courtesy of Antonio Ruediger’s deflected own goal.Julian Nagelsmann’s Germany next face Hungary on Wednesday before taking on Switzerland in their final Group A match.“We played with a lot of intensity and played the right spaces, took some risks and that is why we scored. We played an outstanding first half and we were up 3-0,” Germany captain Ilkay Guendogan said.“That is how we wanted to start. I had a good feeling before the game and I was proved right.”“The start is what we wanted but still the goal we let in showed that all teams have quality and if you don't pay attention you will be punished.”The Scots, who lost Porteous for a studs-up challenge on Guendogan that earned the hosts their penalty, must quickly go back to the drawing board and regroup if they are to make it past the group stage for the first time in a major tournament.POWERFUL STARTThe Germans, who lost their opening matches at the 2018 and 2022 World Cups as well as the previous Euros in 2021, dominated possession from the start with the Scots defending high.That ambitious strategy proved fatal for the visitors, who left far too many open spaces at the back, and it did not take long for the hosts to punish them.Toni Kroos flighted a perfect 30-metre cross for Joshua Kimmich who timed his pass to Wirtz perfectly for the winger to drill home for a 10th minute lead and become the youngest scorer for Germany at a Euros aged 21.With Scotland still recovering, Germany struck again nine minutes later, with Guendogan slipping another ball past the Scottish backline, this time for Havertz on the left, with the forward laying it off for Musiala in the box to rifle home.It was the start all of Germany was hoping for as hundreds of thousands of supporters across several fan zones erupted with joy, but there was more to come with Porteus’ reckless challenge and dismissal conceding a spot kick Havertz easily converted.It was one-way traffic again after the break and Germany added a fourth through substitute Fuellkrug’s fiercely struck shot in the 69th as Scotland coach Steve Clarke, the first man to lead the team to back-to-back Euros, looked on helplessly.“First half, we just got it all wrong really, didn’t show up, weren’t aggressive enough, and we let good players get on the ball,” said Scotland captain Andy Robertson.“Second half, we’re down to 10 men and I thought the lads dug in really well. We have to bounce back quickly because there was lots wrong here and it’s a quick turnaround now.”Scotland, who did not have one effort on or off target, pulled a goal back late on when Ruediger inadvertently headed the ball into his own net but substitute Emre Can then curled home a fine shot in stoppage time for the Germans’ fifth goal.The reeling Scots next play the Swiss on Wednesday. \nNepal blew their chances of qualifying for the Super Eight of the 2024 ICC Men’s T20 World Cup after losing to South Africa by a single run in a last-over nail-biter at the Arnos Vale Ground in West Indies.The Rhinos had everything on the line and were in need of two runs off the last ball of the game when Gulshan Jha was caught between the wickets by Quinton de Kock.Earlier, the Rhinos put up a great bowling display, restricting South Africa, who were sent to bat first, to a lowly total of 115 runs.Opener Quinton de Kock managed to put 10 runs off 11 balls before being dismissed by Dipendra Singh Airee in 3.4 overs. Kushal Bhurtel then picked out South Africa captain Aiden Markram for a 22-ball 15 in 11.2 overs and had Heinrich Klaasen caught by Karan KC for a cheap three shortly after.Kock’s opening partner Reeza Hendricks managed to stay on the ground, smashing five hits to the fences and a maximum, accumulating 43 runs, highest of the innings, before being sent to the pavilion by Airee in 15.3 overs.Tristan Stubbs was the only other South African batter to score in double digits, putting an unbeaten 27 in his 18-knock play.Bhurtel claimed four wickets in his four-over spell, giving away just 19 runs. Similarly, Airee also bowled four overs, grabbing three wickets and conceding 21 runs.Despite the easy chase, Nepal found themselves on the losing end, putting up 114 runs at a loss of seven wickets at the end of the stipulated 20 overs.The Rhinos were off to a good start with openers Bhurtel and Aashif Sheikh building a decent first-wicket partnership. However, the tides turned quickly for Nepal as South Africa’s Tabraiz Shamsi struck twice in a single over, dismissing Bhurtel for 13 in 7.2 overs, and captain Rohit Paudel for a duck only two deliveries later.Sheikh stood undeterred, building a half-century partnership with Anil Sah to bring some much-needed relief to the Nepali innings. Sah scored 27 runs, which featured three boundaries and a six, before being caught by Marco Jansen off Aiden Markram.Just as the innings were steadying for the Rhinos, Shamsi struck again, proving a thorn in Nepal’s flesh. Nepal were in need of 18 runs off as many deliveries at the end of 16 overs when they dealt a massive blow, losing Dipendra Singh Airee (6), Aasif Sheikh (42) and Kushal Malla (1) in a span of five balls.Tension ran high as Nepal were still in need of eight runs with an over to spare. Gulshan Jha, who took to the field at number seven, missed twice, narrowing the game down to eight runs with four deliveries in hand.Jha then smashed a boundary. The game was down to two runs off as many balls, but he missed again. With only a single delivery remaining, Jha and his partner Sompal Kami made the run for an equaliser, but the former was run out, ending Nepal’s hopes of competing in the World Cup.For South Africa, Tabraiz Shamsi grabbed four wickets while Aiden Markram also dismissed a Nepali batter. \nNepal restricted South Africa to a lowly total of 115 runs in Group D match of the 2024 ICC Men’s T20 World Cup being held at the Arnos Vale Ground, West Indies.Sent to bat first, the Group D leaders struggled to put points together as Nepal’s Kushal Bhurtel and Dipendra Singh Airee shone with the ball.Opener Quinton de Kock managed to put 10 tuns off 11 balls before being dismissed by Airee in 3.4 overs.Bhurtel then picked out South Africa captain Aiden Markram for a 22-ball 15 in 11.2 overs, and had Heinrich Klaasen caught by Karan KC for a cheap three shortly after.Kock’s opening partner Reeza Hendricks stood his ground, smashing five hits to the fences and a maximum, accumulating 43 runs, highest of the innings, before being sent to the pavillion by Airee in 15.3 overs.Tristan Stubbs was the only other South African batter to score in double digits, putting an unbeaten 27 in his 18-knock play.Bhurtel claimed four wickets in his four-0ver spell, giving away just 19 runs. Similarly, Airee also bowled four overs, grabbing three wickets and conceding 21 runs.South Africa have already reached the Super Eight stage after heavy rain in Florida led to the abandonment of the Nepal-Sri Lanka match on June 11.Nepal lost to the Netherlands in their opening game and sit in the fourth position with one point. But they still have a chance to progress to the Super Eight if they win both of their remaining matches—against South Africa and Bangladesh. \nNepal can finally breathe a sigh of relief and will have at least something to cheer for when they return home from Saudi Arabia—thanks to a spirited battle against a strong Yemen.The Gorkhalis headed into their last Group H game of the second round of the 2026 FIFA World Cup and 2027 AFC Asian Cup Qualifiers against Yemen on Tuesday low in confidence after losing all of their previous five matches, with their most recent embarrassment coming in a 4-0 drubbing by group winners United Arab Emirates last week.Vincenzo Alberto Annese’s men had conceded 18 goals in five qualifiers matches, scoring none in reply.Nepal’s dismal qualifiers campaign was also partly contributed by the sheer negligence of sports authorities All Nepal Football Association (ANFA) and National Sports Council whose poor management of the country’s only international standard football venue—Dasharath Stadium—forced Nepal to play their two home matches at neutral venues.However, on Tuesday, they floored Yemen with a dogged fightback until the death after initially falling behind to a ninth minute Nasser Al Gahwashi penalty at the Prince Mohammad bin Fahd Stadium in Dammam, thanks to Sanjeeb Bista and Gillespye Jung Karki whose goals either side of the half time turned things around for Nepal.Although Mohammed Al Dahi’s equaliser in the first minute of stoppage time denied them a first victory of the qualifiers and also a first win against Yemen, their dogged display will still serve as a testament that the youth Nepali squad have a lot of potential.The draw against Yemen will especially wash the burden off the Italian coach Annese whose contract with Nepal is expiring this month.Annese, who was appointed as Nepal head coach in March last year, has been under a sharp knife following a series of disappointing results that also included a draw against minnows Bhutan, disappointing SAFF Championship campaign and World Cup Qualifiers first round struggles against Laos.The 39-year-old coach has been using the exodus of Nepali football stars including Bimal Gharti Magar and Sujal Shrestha to Australia and an inexperienced squad as his defence for Nepal’s poor run of results in the international arena.But he seems to have finally cracked the code in his probably last game with Nepal as coach. And the output against Yemen could possibly convince ANFA to trigger another extension in his contract. ANFA had added a three-month extension in Annese’s contract this year.The emergence of Sanjeeb, who only made his international debut in March this year as an 88th minute substitute during a 5-0 qualifiers loss to Bahrain, is even more promising.Sanjeeb, who played full 90 minutes in Nepal’s 3-0 loss against Bahrain before being benched in 4-0 defeat to the UAE, had a hand in both of Nepal’s goals against Yemen in Dammam.Sanjeeb, who replaced star forward Anjan Bista in the front, first pounced on a misplaced back pass from Radhawan Al Hubaishi and bent the ball past Yemen goalkeeper Mohammed Khairalah to score an equaliser in the 22nd minute.Sanjeeb then received a long pass from Chhiring Lama and served it for Karki to head home Nepal’s second goal in the 66th.It was the first international goals for both Sanjeeb and Karki. Karki made his debut for Nepal in September last year during Nepal’s goalless draw with Myanmar. The evening was also memorable for Nepal captain Kiran Kumar Limbu. Playing his 100th international match, the 34-year-old goalkeeper produced a string of stunning saves to keep Yemen at bay till the final moments and helped Nepal earn a point.Even though Nepal failed to reach the third round of the FIFA World Cup Qualifiers and could not directly qualify for the 2027 Asian Cup, they still have a chance to secure their spot in their maiden Asian Cup through Asian Cup Qualification which will be played between March 25, 2025 to March 31, 2026.Top two teams from each nine groups qualified for the third round of 2026 FIFA World Cup and also secured a direct berth to the 2027 AFC Asian Cup. Qatar, Kuwait, Japan, North Korea, South Korea, China, Oman, Kyrgyzstan, Iran, Uzbekistan, Iraq, Indonesia, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, UAE, Bahrain, Australia and Palestine progressed.The 18 nations who failed to advance (India, Afghanistan, Syria, Myanmar, Thailand, Singapore, Malaysia, Chinese Taipei, Turkmenistan, Hong Kong, Vietnam, Philippines, Tajikistan, Pakistan, Yemen, Nepal, Lebanon and Bangladesh) will compete in the 24-team AFC Asian Cup Qualifiers, with only six teams making it to the Asian Cup finals.Bhutan, the Maldives and Laos will join them in the third round of Asian Cup Qualification as the best ranking losing teams of the first round. The winners of the Asian Cup Qualifiers playoffs between Sri Lanka and Cambodia, Timor-Leste and Mongolia and Brunei Darussalam and Macau will also be in the competition. \nUS President Joe Biden could soon announce a new effort to allow immigrants in the US illegally to obtain legal status if they are married to US citizens, three sources said, an election-year move that could energize some liberal voters.Biden is expected to unveil the effort as soon as Tuesday at a White House event, two of the sources said, requesting anonymity to discuss internal plans still subject to change.Biden, a Democrat, is seeking a second term in the November 5 election that will pit him against Republican challenger Donald Trump, an immigration hardliner.Biden has grappled with record numbers of migrants caught crossing the US-Mexico border illegally on his watch and recently rolled out a restrictive new asylum ban at the border to deter crossers.Some fellow Democrats and immigrant advocates opposed the asylum ban and have called on Biden to protect long-term US residents who lack legal status, including spouses.Reuters reported in April that the White House was considering ways to allow the spouses to obtain legal status.White House spokesperson Angelo Fernandez Hernandez did not confirm any coming immigration relief, but said in a statement that Biden officials “remain committed to taking action to address our broken immigration system.”Biden said in June 4 remarks on the asylum ban that in coming weeks he would “speak to how we can make our immigration system more fair and more just.”Tuesday’s White House event will be tied to the anniversary of the 2012 Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program.The DACA program was launched by former President Barack Obama and then-Vice President Biden and currently grants deportation relief and work permits to 528,000 people brought to the US as children.The US State Department also could roll out new guidance that says DACA recipients should be presumed eligible for non-immigrant visas if they leave the US, one of the sources said.Representative Nanette Barragan, a Democrat and head of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, said she would attend the White House event and urged Biden to take action to protect spouses of US. citizens and DACA recipients.Barragan said in an interview that Biden could contrast himself with Trump, who has vowed to launch the largest deportation effort in US history.“I think it could be significant for the lives of these people who are living in the shadows, who are married to American citizens and who are under threat of being removed from the country,” she said.An estimated 1.1 million immigrants in the US illegally are married to US citizens, according to data by advocacy organization FWD.us, but how many of those would be included in a possible Biden action remained unclear. \nSenior officials of South Korea and the United States held an emergency phone call over a possible impending visit by Russian President Vladimir Putin to North Korea, Seoul’s foreign ministry said on Friday.South Korea’s vice foreign minister, Kim Hong-kyun, in the phone call with US Deputy Secretary of State Kurt Campbell, said that Putin’s visit should not result in deeper military cooperation between Pyongyang and Moscow in violation of UN Security Council resolutions, the ministry said.Echoing Kim’s concerns, Campbell pledged continued cooperation to tackle potential regional instability and challenges caused by the trip.‘While closely monitoring related developments, the two sides agreed to resolutely respond through airtight cooperation to North Korea’s provocations against South Korea and actions that escalate tensions in the region,” the ministry said in a statement.On Wednesday, a senior official at Seoul’s presidential office said Putin was expected to visit North Korea “in the coming days”. Russia’s Vedomosti newspaper on Monday reported Putin would visit North Korea and Vietnam in the coming weeks.Civilian aircraft have been cleared from Pyongyang’s airport and there are signs of preparations for a possible parade in the capital’s Kim Il Sung Square, NK PRO, a Seoul-based website, reported this week, citing commercial satellite imagery.When Sergei Shoigu, then Russia’s defence minister, visited Pyongyang last year to jumpstart the two countries’ warming ties, he accompanied Kim to a parade and saluted as North Korea’s banned nuclear-tipped missiles rolled by.Speaking at the Stimson Center think tank in Washington on Wednesday, Campbell said the United States has a very good understanding of what North Korea has provided Russia, which he said has had “a substantial impact on the battlefield”.Less clear, he said, is what Russia has provided North Korea.“Hard currency? Is it energy? Is it capabilities that allow them to advance their nuclear or missile products? We don’t know. But we’re concerned by that and watching carefully,” he said. \nNepal's book market is rife with unauthorized translations, violating the rights of authors like Taslima Nasrin and leading to concerns over quality and the tarnishing of the country's reputation in the global market.\nBharat Budha, chair of Putha Uttarganga Rural Municipality’s ward 10, knows that many youths from his village have made it to the United States via ‘tallo bato’—backdoor route—and that many are still on the way. He also knows that eight of them have been deported from the country and that they have lost a cumulative Rs45 million in the process. The deported youths say that they returned home empty-handed after facing unspeakable ordeals and lost Rs6 million each on average.The Tak village in Rukum East—a close-knit settlement of 425 houses—was considered the Maoists’ ‘base area’ during the insurgency. Village youths who reached the US through illegal routes and got deported have lost an estimated Rs40 million. The number of those who returned without completing the journey and the amount they lost remain unknown.To get to the US, the youths have taken loans at up to 36 percent interest per annum from their relatives and village landowners. In Tak village, at least one person each from half of the households has gone abroad, Budha said. “Youths started going to America about six-seven years ago,” he said. “If they could gather enough money, the whole village would try to go to the US.” Budha’s own son had reached the US illegally in 2017, spending Rs3.2 million.During the insurgency, outsize slogans of revolution would adorn the walls of houses in the village. Hoping for a better life, people from all walks of life helped out the Maoists. But now, village youths are paying the agents to illegally get to the US—a country that the Maoists used to call their ‘enemy’, an ‘imperialistic force’. This has cost the Tak village much and in multiple ways.Death of a dreamSome of the deported youths have chosen to flee the village altogether, burdened with debt and creditors’ pressure. At least five such families have already left, said a resident. The family of Ram Budha was one of them. On April 28, 2015, Ram, who had returned to Nepal after working in Malaysia for eight years, took the illegal route to the US. He travelled through arduous trails for months and finally arrived in the country. Upon reaching the country, he was detained and had to stay at the detention camp for 27 months. When his refugee application was rejected, he was deported to Nepal in mid-December 2019. He lost Rs4.5 million in the process. He now owes over Rs6 million to creditors. “After the creditors began to put pressure on me, I couldn’t live in the village peacefully,” said Ram, who currently runs a vegetable farm in Tarakeshwar, Kathmandu.While those who got to the US through illegal routes and fortunately got refugee status there narrate their stories with pride, those who have been deported or returned from half-way have tragic tales to tell.Nanda Kala Gharti, who lives in a small stone house on the upper flank of Tak village, spends her days in melancholy. Her husband, Dhanlal, had chosen to take the illegal route to the US, and Nanda Kala, a mother of four, is living with the repercussions of his decision. Dhanlal had got into the US after a six-month long arduous journey and was detained immediately. He had to spend four years in the detention camp, before he was deported to Nepal. He had already lost Rs6 million.Nanda Kala said they now have an insurmountable crisis in their hands. Pointing to her son, she exclaimed, “When will he grow up, go abroad and pay back the loans!”Dhanlal himself tried to go to Croatia once and spent 15 days in Kathmandu for the process. But after he was turned down, he returned home dejected. “Now we will submit the passport to another agent [for Dhanlal’s trip abroad],” Nanda Kala said. “There’s no point staying here.”Stories that echo each otherThe situation in Sisne Rural Municipality is similar to that of Putha Uttarganga. Here, one can hear plenty of stories of those who have tried to go to the US and those who are fighting refugee cases there. Krishna Regmi, chair of the rural municipality, personally knows seven people who have been deported from the US.Gangaram Khadka, a resident of Sisne-3, runs a bee and chicken farm. Like other young men in his village, Khadka had headed off to the US via an illegal route on 27 March, 2018. He had reached the US via the New Delhi-Moscow-Barcelona-Bogota-Panama-Costa Rica-Nicaragua-Honduras-Guatemala-Mexico route. When he finally arrived in the US, he was detained and had to spend 11 months in detention. He was deported on 15 March, 2019. He had handed over Rs3.2 millions to the agent and spent Rs2 million to fight the case to become a refugee. “It’s not possible for me to pay back the loan while working in Nepal,” he said. “I aim to pay back some interest and head off abroad again.”For six months after Khadka was deported, he had anxiety and headache, he said, adding the three people from his village who were deported like him are also struggling with their mental health.Tikaram Pun, a 40-year-old resident of Bohora village in Musikot-4, is also haunted by his past journey. In September 2017, he reached the US after crossing 17 countries with the help of organised human traffickers. Of the 41 people in his group, 31 were from Rukum East and Rukum West, he said. Pun, who was detained on arrival in the US, spent 24 months in a detention camp. His refugee application was also refused and so he was deported along with eight other Nepalis. “When I returned, I started having mental health problems. I still suffer from them,” he said. Pun is under pressure from creditors and relatives to pay back the Rs9.2 million loan he had taken for the task.Those who died on the wayA group of 10 Bangladeshis and seven Nepalis, including Rupak Bohora of Bafikot-3 in Rukum West, were on a mission to reach Costa Rica through Colombia, Caribbean Coast, Capuragana and Panama. But while they were crossing a sea, their boat capsized. As many as 12 died in the incident, including six Nepalis. Rupak’s wife, Geeta, learned about the incident only after six days, on 25 June, 2021.“I still don’t know what exactly happened,” said Geeta, who had been married off at age 19 and is now a mother of two daughters. The only thing she knows is that Rupak has died and she is now all alone. And that she has Rs5 million in loan taken for Rupak’s trip. She showed a picture of her husband on her phone to this scribe and said, “I only have memories.”Lack of political will and legal remediesThe concrete bridge over Chewang river is on the edge of Tak village. On the walls of the bridge are paintings of political theorists like Marx, Engels, Lenin, Stalin and Mao, and the iconic slogan, ‘Workers of the world, unite!’, below them. But the slogan appears to be at odds with life in the village. Given the phenomenon of illegal travels to the US through the help of organised human traffickers, the whole village appears to be emptying. Neither the local governments are concerned about the phenomenon nor are the political parties paying attention.Puniraj Gharti, chair of Putha Uttarganga Rural Municipality, said though the trend is worrying, there’s nothing he can do. “How could we stop them from making the trip when they are struggling to make a living in the village?” he said.Krishna Regmi, chair of Sisne Rural Municipality, said that the vicious cycle of poverty started after marijuana farming was banned in the country. Then the Maoist insurgency added to the woe, forcing youths to migrate. The signing of the peace agreement in 2006 didn’t herald any change in the economy either and youths are struggling to get jobs. Organised human traffickers are cashing in on this sorry state of affairs, Regmi said. “Meter byajis [usurious lenders] are also promoting this phenomenon,” he added.The phenomenon is equally rife in Dang’s Tulsipur and Ghorahi. Ramesh Kumar Pandey, chair of Ghorai-15, says that even though many heading to the US are swindled, no complaints are filed at the ward office. “Only those who attempt to go to Saudi Arabia or Qatar file the complaints,” he said.One can infer from Pandey’s statements that the families of such illegal travellers don’t want to publicise the ordeals of their family members. On the one hand, agents threaten them to not publicise the issue; on the other, they fear they themselves would be punished by law.According to the Anti-Human Trafficking Bureau, as many as 178 Nepalis, including 174 men, have been deported from the US in the five fiscal years after 2018-19. Of them, the highest 49 are from Rukum while 37 are from Dang. The data doesn’t include those who returned after making it to the half-way or those who have been fighting the legal battle in the US for refugee status. But this data is enough to show that many such youths are from the ‘base areas’ of the Maoist insurgency.SSP Jeevan Shrestha, chief of the bureau, said that data on the number of such victims and the amounts they have spent is hard to collect since complaints are rarely filed with the police. “This is human trafficking but for a lack of law, we are still compelled to launch the cases as per Human Trafficking and Transportation (Control) Act 2074 BS,” Shrestha said. “The Act provides a maximum penalty of Rs250,000 for the offenders and 50 percent of that as compensation to the victims.” Without specific law, police also invoke the theft and organised crime act to punish the offenders, he added.On the one hand, police receive no complaints; on the other, the phenomenon sees no control.Bhaskar Gautam, a political scientist, says the rise in cases of human trafficking in the insurgency’s ‘base areas’ is due to the political system’s abject failure.While the Maoists raised issues related to livelihood, nationalism and a new kind of democracy to fuel their war machine, after the peace process, it is livelihoods that have been hit the hardest, Gautam said. “The traditional way of life and economy took a hit during the insurgency,” he said. “Developments after the peace process also failed to address that. What sprang up was organised human trafficking.”(Mahesh KC in Rukum East and Durgalal KC in Dang contributed to this report.)This report is prepared in collaboration with the Center for Investigative Journalism-Nepal. \nHospitals in Pokhara, Chitwan, Biratnagar, and Butwal brazenly disregard government regulations mandating free treatment for underprivileged patients, denying access to essential healthcare due to regulatory failures and lack of enforcement.\nThe Nepali cricket team’s second-ever T20 World Cup should have been a moment of joy but has turned into a dark crisis. But first, some introductions.Ever since I can remember, playing and watching cricket have been important parts of my identity. I have followed with joy the rise of Nepali cricket over the last 20 years. I am what you might call a fanatic. I never miss any Nepal match if I can help it, be it a friendly with a local club in India, a crunch qualifier against one of our nemesis associate nations, or a World Cup match against a Test nation. It does not matter what time zone a match is being played or where I am. I have also followed Sandeep Lamichhane’s career closely. He put Nepali cricket on the international map, and whether he played for the national team or some local T20 franchise, I tried to find a working link to be able to watch him play.I am establishing these credentials first because I expect fellow passionate Nepali cricket fans will rush to dismiss what comes next. But I want you to know that I love Nepali cricket just as much as you do, and so this is not part of some conspiracy to discredit Sandeep or Nepali cricket. Quite the opposite: I care about Nepali cricket too much to stay silent. At a time when populist stunts are rife, it feels necessary to speak truth to power, as an expression of love. Custodians of rape cultureMuch has been written about Sandeep’s Gaushala-26 rape case. As a rule of thumb, I choose to believe victims. The harassment she has faced—which culminated in her suicide attempt—beggars belief. She has remained steadfast against all pressure, rejecting advances to “settle” the case. It is hard to imagine why else anyone would willingly subject themselves to such inhumane treatment. This reflection, though, is not just about whether Sandeep raped Gaushala-26. My focus here is to examine Sandeep’s case as a textbook example of how our institutions perpetuate rape culture, where sexual abuse and violence are normalised. Custodian 1: The fansEver since Sandeep has been accused, the vast majority of his fans have taken to social media to defend him, as well as to defame the victim. Perhaps it is no surprise in a deeply patriarchal society in the grips of populism, where hero worship has taken new heights. Sandeep is a hero to many, and apparently he can do no wrong. Or, even if he wrongs, he is still above the law because he can bowl a mean googly, and that’s what matters. These fans- mostly but not exclusively young men- are vocal in their support for Sandeep. Even when he was a convicted felon, never mind when he was just accused of being a rapist- that too potentially of a minor- cricket mattered more to his devotees. Such craze toward their favourite cricketer substantially sustained a rape culture where allegations of sexual abuse were relegated to oblivion. When an overwhelming, assertive, visible, and vitriolic population aggressively downplays rape charges, it extinguishes any hope victims might have in their elusive quest for justice. Custodian 2: The courtsEvery level of the court system has already weighed in on Sandeep’s case. The Supreme Court—in its infinite wisdom—allowed him to represent the national team and travel abroad while on trial for rape charges. Along with the Prime Minister, who found it fitting to felicitate Sandeep in the middle of his trial, the Supreme Court’s tacit endorsement of Sandeep has made a mockery of victims’ rights and cemented rape culture as the established norm in Nepal. The Kathmandu District Court was at least bold enough to convict Sandeep of rape, though it did not find the victim to be a minor, which would have led to more significant consequences for Sandeep. Knowledge sources had commented then that this was already paving the way for a successful appeal later, which soon came to pass. The High Court overturned that conviction, acquitting Sandeep of all charges. Almost instantaneously, the fans came out in droves and celebrated that decision. Social media is swarmed with comments about how if Sandeep was punished when convicted, he should be reinstated immediately now that he is acquitted. It is an open secret that the judiciary- like many other institutions in Nepal- is compromised. Power and privilege run deep, and decisions are not just made on the merits of the legal argument. To all the fans now celebrating Sandeep’s acquittal and making that the basis for his rehabilitation, I have just one question: If you are from a poor family and if your loved one is sexually assaulted by someone rich, powerful, or politically connected, do you genuinely expect our judicial system to impart justice and punish the perpetrator? Take a moment, put yourself in the shoes of Gaushala-26’s family, and reflect on this question. If you honestly believe that justice would be served, I have a bridge to sell you.Custodian 3: CAN and the cricketing fraternityThe Cricket Association of Nepal (CAN) has towed a fine line, appearing to uphold the law in the strictest sense. As soon as Sandeep was convicted, CAN suspended him from all cricketing activities. He was only reinstated after he was acquitted by the High Court. Dig a bit deeper though, and rape culture rears its ugly head. Even while facing serious rape charges, CAN was not compelled by any sense of morality to prevent him from representing Nepal. Within moments of the High Court’s acquittal, CAN officials rushed to announce that Sandeep had been reinstated. They went above and beyond to lobby the US Embassy to grant him a visa on time. When that failed, they facilitated his travel to St. Vincent and the Grenadines for him to play the remaining matches. They have lobbied the International Cricket Council to ensure his inclusion while sacrificing another player from the squad. To be sure, CAN has faced incredible scrutiny and received intense pressure from “the fans” to back Sandeep. Yet, the rush to not only rehabilitate but actually elevate Sandeep demonstrates that CAN only saw the case as a nuisance. Even if the legal burden of proof might not have been met, CAN could and should have investigated whether Sandeep met the national team’s code of conduct, as has been customary in similar cases around the world. It should have taken time to study the decision, and it could have waited for the legal process to reach its logical conclusion; it is all but certain that a Supreme Court appeal will follow. What CAN has not done speaks volumes of how rape culture is sustained in Nepal. To my knowledge, no official has spoken publicly about whether Sandeep’s actions violated the expectations placed on national players, or expressed concern or solidarity for the victim. The reasons for Sandeep’s absence have been conveniently ignored, as if he has simply been on holiday or nursing a minor injury. Just as his absence was unexplained, so too has his return been left ‘unsaid’. The gaslighting of the entire saga shows the contempt with which the issue is treated in Nepal. The wider cricketing fraternity—which includes players, former players, coaches, commentators, sponsors, and officials—has, at best, adopted a veil of silence or, at worst, come out publicly in Sandeep’s support. Respected national and international commentators have found it convenient to use phrases such as “Sandeep is not available” when away and “Sandeep, the talisman of Nepali cricket, is back” now, without any mention of the dark context. A moment to engage with and educate a whole nation on how to take rape charges, and its victim, seriously has been left unaddressed. Because, of course, cricket comes first. A naïve hopeI expect the backlash to this piece to be swift and severe. It feels poignant that I am travelling to watch Nepal play in the World Cup in the very matches Sandeep will now play. But his celebrated return has filled me with dread, anxiety, and disgust, to the point that I do not know how to support my beloved team anymore. Spare a thought for Gaushala-26 and for all victims of rape and rape culture. Regardless of the legalese, we must strive to build a culture where victims are empowered and supported to speak up and stand for the truth. Nepali cricket has always found a way through adversity, often miraculously. Our obsession with star power must be replaced with a focus on the role cricket, and citizens, should play in sustaining a culture of accountability and respect for victims. As amazing as it is, cricket is still only a game and must become a vehicle for good, not evil.  \nAmidst ongoing atrocities in Ukraine, Sudan, Israel, and Gaza, the international community emphasizes criminal prosecutions for justice, but this approach risks oversimplifying victims' rights and neglecting holistic responses such as transitional justice measures that prioritize their needs and context-specific reparations.\nTorrential rains mark the onset of Asar, signifying a surge in last-minute capital spending, known as 'Asarey Vikas,' characterized by hasty and substandard road construction due to government and contractor urgency to meet financial deadlines.\nWhen it arrives, it can bring both bounty and bane. However, due to a changing climate, monsoons in recent times have invariably resulted in more hardship than help. This monsoon, which arrived in Nepal on Monday, three days ahead of the usual date, will certainly buoy farmers and provide much-needed relief from the blistering heat, but concerns over its severity still loom large. Experts have predicted above-normal rains and above-average maximum and minimum temperatures. As this will exacerbate floods, landslides and epidemics, disaster preparedness becomes crucial.Our responses to natural disasters have consistently fallen short. Governments come and go, but the same pattern repeats every year, and hundreds of lives, and a whole lot of properties and physical infrastructure are left at nature’s mercy. Not that the country has no plans and policies for disaster preparedness. This year, as in previous ones, the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Authority has devised the Monsoon Preparedness and Response Plan, which is commendable. The necessary logistics and emergency relief materials have also been stockpiled in all provinces, according to officials. The problem, however, is with the execution of these plans. This monsoon is estimated to put 1.81 million people and 412,000 households at risk, and require 18,000 rescues. These numbers are large, suggesting the necessity for a comprehensive response to disasters and ensuring that relief programmes reach the most vulnerable and needy. Lack of effective coordination between federal, provincial and local levels has also caused several problems during disasters. Local governments play a big role as primary rescuers in floods and landslides, but they are still far short in human and financial resources. The examples from the earthquake-devastated Rukum West, Sindhupalchowk and several other places highlight how Nepal fails to rehabilitate the disaster-displaced people for long periods. The residents of Rukum West are still obliged to live in houses with cracks and fissures, and experts warn that these houses could be badly damaged this monsoon. There is also high risk to those living in high landslide and flood prone areas. Unless we design approaches that include not only immediate relief programmes but also year-round relocation, rehabilitation, monitoring and study, people will continue to suffer. Also, proactive measures like public awareness and early warning should be strengthened.Moreover, monsoons are notorious for water- and vector-borne diseases, including dengue, cholera and typhoid. Dengue cases are already being reported from different parts of the country and the caseload will likely increase during and after the monsoon. Water resource contamination has surged in the past few months, leading to a higher number of water-borne disease cases in hospitals. During the monsoon preparedness, the authorities shouldn’t overlook these epidemics and focus particularly on areas that are more prone to diseases and, therefore, need timely healthcare intervention and workers.A coordinated effort from health, home, urban development and water supply ministries can help make this monsoon a lot safer. In the long run, we should find ways to mitigate the effects of climate change, which has exacerbated our climatic conditions and intensified disasters. Understanding the impact of climate change and human activities on weather will help us better prepare for future monsoons and the disasters that come in their wake.  \nThe Janata Samajbadi Party-Nepal inaugurated its second general convention on Monday. The Upendra Yadav-led party is holding the mega event at a time the party has suffered multiple setbacks. Seven of its 12 federal lawmakers split the JSP-Nepal and registered a new outfit—Janata Samajbadi Party—at the Election Commission last month. The party of Upendra Yadav, who headed the party that had continuously led Madhesh provincial government since 2018, has been pushed to the opposition bench in the provincial assembly. Yadav, who was deputy prime minister and health minister in the Pushpa Kamal Dahal-led Cabinet until last month, has been ousted from the federal government as well. Despite such adverse circumstances, Yadav is poised to be the party chief again, most likely unopposed.Yadav rose to power after successfully spearheading a Madhesh movement in 2007 demanding rights for the historically marginalised Madheshi people. Though the demand for federalism had been raised by various quarters even in the past, it was Yadav-led agitation that eventually forced the Nepali state to introduce the federal system in the country. He formed Madheshi Janadhikar Forum-Nepal under his own leadership. Since then he has always been at the helm of a party. He has merged his party with various outfits, multiple times, only to split again.With the rise of Madheshi parties in the aftermath of the second people’s movement in 2006, people—not only from the southern belt of the country but also from most marginalised communities—had high hopes for a paradigm shift in Nepali politics. The big parties traditionally holding power, namely the Nepali Congress and the CPN-UML, had felt pressure. But within years of their joining governments in Kathmandu, people were disenchanted by their performance. A section of people expected that the regional parties would do better when allowed to lead provincial governments. They failed in the province as well.In Nepal, communist leaders and parties have been infamous for persistent disputes and divisions, mostly after the 1990 political change. When parties mushroomed in Madhesh, they beat the communists in terms of infightings and divisions. There is not a single party in Madhesh that remained intact, which is disappointing for those who expected that regional forces would build pressure on traditional forces through better delivery.Mismanagement, lack of organisational discipline, non-transparency and top leaders’ monopoly in decision-making have become common traits of Madhesh-based parties. Big parties such as the Congress, the UML and the Maoist Centre are criticised for being monopolistic and rather undemocratic. But, newer forces proved themselves worse. For instance, at least the big parties have been holding their general conventions as per the constitutional provision. Their provincial, district and village units are also elected through a process. For example, the UML is now electing its district leaders through conventions. When they fail to pick leaders in consensus, they readily go for a vote. Top leaders may favour those loyal to them but even these loyalists must nonetheless follow the process. That is why the UML is considered the most organised party in the country. The Congress also follows at least basic democratic norms while electing its leaders and making important decisions. But we don’t see the same in Madhesh-based and other newly emerged forces. This is unfortunate. Only political parties that are well-organised, democratic and transparent in their activities will have the moral strength to mount pressure on big forces. Those who can’t maintain democracy and transparency in their own organisations can’t ensure it in the government when they come to power. We hardly find any leader in Madhesh handing over party leadership to other leaders through a democratic process. We hope that in the ongoing convention Yadav’s JSP-Nepal can bring policies to make the party organisation more transparent and democratic. \nAmbassadors aren’t magicians. No matter how good their PR skills are, it takes time and effort to cultivate good working relations with the officials of their host countries. When a country constantly chops and changes its ambassadors, diplomacy becomes difficult. Nepali political parties have a wretched record of abruptly recalling ambassadors appointed by the previous coalition governments. But Thursday's silly recall of Dr Shankar Sharma, Nepali ambassador to India, must be the most egregious of them all. The Cabinet decided to recall Sharma days ahead of Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal’s New Delhi visit to attend the third swearing-in of Narendra Modi as India’s prime minister. Why couldn’t Dahal have waited until he got back from New Delhi? With what authority would an ambassador that his prime minister clearly does not trust coordinate his India trip? Why the rush, one wonders. Of course, it is natural for a new government to want to appoint those it can rely on as the country’s envoys. But then our envoys are Nepal’s representatives abroad, whose conduct can make or break the country’s image. This is why only the most capable of them should make the cut. And if the best of the best are chosen, they should be allowed to work for the four full years. This time, the government has recalled not just its Indian ambassador but also its envoys from 10 other countries, including the US and the UK. Notably, these envoys were appointed by the same prime minister before he changed his main coalition partner, from the Nepali Congress to the CPN-UML. This is unfortunate. Political instability has had a devastating impact on Nepali economy as it now struggles to achieve even a modest 4 percent annual growth. It has destroyed our domestic institutions. The same instability is now also affecting our standing abroad. If Nepal’s major political actors cannot send a message of unity and purpose to the rest of the world, how will others trust us? Why would they come and invest in Nepal?Our relations with major powers like India and the US are not things to be trifled with, at a time of heightened geopolitical competition in the region. In these contested times, the only way Nepal can safely navigate the choppy geopolitical waters is through mature diplomacy. Appoint the right people in the right capitals and give them a free hand. What is particularly strange about the most recent recall of 11 ambassadors is that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs seems to have been bypassed, as the decision was apparently made against the advice of Foreign Minister Narayan Kaji Shrestha. This is not the first time that the advice of the foreign ministry has been sidelined. The diplomatic code of conduct is widely ignored and the ministry continues to be kept out of the loop as our top leaders engage with their foreign counterparts. Again, even if the ambassadors are to be appointed on political quotas (which they ideally should not), there can be a political understanding to pick the best of the lot and to let them serve out their term. Unless that happens, political instability at home will continue to harm Nepal's foreign conduct, with grave consequences for the Nepali national interest.  \nPrithvi Subba Gurung, deputy general secretary of the CPN-UML, is one of the leaders who strongly lobbied for a federal system while the Constituent Assembly was writing the constitution between 2008 to 2015. Eight years after the adoption of the federal democratic republican constitution, the federal system, particularly the provinces, are widely being criticised for their supposed failure to deliver. The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal asks former Gandaki chief minister Gurung what went wrong in the course of implementing the federal system.The implementation of the federal system has faced several hurdles since its adoption. Most provinces have for months failed even to form the governments, let alone run them efficiently. Where is the problem?We have adopted a federal system but are working against its spirit. Provinces should run autonomously. On some key issues, federal leaders and the party’s central bodies may give some direction to their provincial bodies. But most provincial activities are still centrally-governed even years after the adoption of federalism. So, our practices aren’t in line with the system. The provincial governments shouldn’t have been affected by the changes in the federal coalition. Such problems were seen in India years ago. But they have learned from their experience. In our case, leaders of major political parties treated the provincial governments as party chapters. The provincial governments are formed and run as per the constitution and all the three tiers of the governments are autonomous. The high commands in our political parties aren’t ready to accept the new constitutional setup.Are the provincial leaders equally responsible as they seek Kathmandu’s nod before taking any important decisions?They seek the centre’s support because they are trained in that way. They are too dependent on the centre. You said India learned by experience and now provinces there work more autonomously. But, in Nepal, provinces are now witnessing more problems than during their first tenure, which is evident also in the difficulties in government formation in multiple provinces. Why couldn’t they learn from the five-year experience?Nepal’s leaders and political parties are still not committed to federalism. They have failed to implement the federal system as per the spirit of the constitution. This is the major problem. The big parties as well as their leaders are guided by a centralised mindset and still prefer working in a unitary system. We should not forget that we transformed the executive and legislative bodies into three tiers of federal systems. But our judiciary retained the old structure. Therefore, the judiciary doesn’t accept the federal system and its practice in a true sense. Its verdicts reflect the same.The role of Speakers and Province Heads has courted controversies in multiple provinces. The top court invalidated some of their decisions. Is it because of lack of clarity, faults in our constitutional provisions, or is it because of the leaders?Speaker and Province Head are political posts created in accordance with constitutional provisions. When overall politics is dirty and unhealthy, those taking up these responsibilities also feel compelled to resort to similar tactics. When overall politics improves, they automatically make better decisions. Mainly there is no leader in the high command who completely owns federalism and is determined to implement it in its true spirit. This government in its policies and programmes unveiled last month had rightly said that “protecting federalism and strengthening the federal democratic republic is our top priority”. But the budget failed to introduce programmes as per the promises made in the policies and programmes.How do we correct these anomalies? Where do we begin?We are in a complex situation. Many have started to float the idea of making amendments to the constitution. But we shouldn’t forget that various forces and stakeholders had their own positions during constitution-making. They made compromises and found middle grounds to promulgate the constitution. If we go for amendments, they all will return to their respective stances. Some may want to revive the Hindu Kingdom while others will stand against it. Some leaders even within Nepali Congress have started to advocate for constitutional monarchy. But we can’t regress to the monarchical system. We can’t renounce secularism and an inclusive democratic system. We can’t backtrack on our commitment to a socialism-oriented system. We may explore some changes in our electoral system or form of governance without going against these key features of our constitution but we can’t destabilise the charter. What are the major flaws to be fixed?There are some. For instance, provinces have no role in education. The responsibility of education up to secondary level is given to the local level. And, everything is controlled by the federal government. The local units are entrusted with key responsibilities such as developing curriculum, overseeing the issues of career developments of teachers and staffers and their promotion as well as transfers etcetera. Local units can’t do all of these things efficiently as they have their own limitations. How can a local unit transfer a teacher from Kaski to Lamjung? Provinces should have been given such responsibilities. The power has been centralised at Singha Durbar. Such is also the situation in other sectors.Though the proportional representation (PR) system is hailed as one of the most beautiful features of our constitution in terms of ensuring inclusion, it has also been blamed for political instability. Many have demanded revision in the electoral system.The major political parties such as the CPN-UML and Nepali Congress have not trained their party members on the proper implementation of key constitutional features such as federalism and electoral system. The party members and general people have either wrongly understood it, or have negative impressions about the systems. These systems were adopted with an objective to resolve our decade-long conflict and address the concerns of the historically marginalised communities and even mainstream some groups through an inclusive democratic system. The idea was to integrate all the communities and maintain unity in diversity. After holding years-long debates on various options, we agreed on the mixed electoral system so as to reflect our diversity in the state agencies.As the proverb goes, “the bad workman blames his tools”, our leaders are blaming the system for their failure to secure a majority by winning people’s trust. Many countries that practise similar electoral systems have progressed. Our electoral system and the form of governance are not causing political instability. Many countries have adopted a parliamentary system and many others have practised the presidential model. Countries have progressed in both the systems. Also, there are examples of failures under both setups. So, the problem lies in our political parties and leaders, not in the systems. Shouldn’t political parties like the UML and Congress work with a plan to secure a majority by winning people’s trust? They aren’t training their focus on that but blaming the system. At times, they have squandered the majority as well and have failed to keep the party intact. Isn’t it our [leaders’] failure?Some argue that the issue of the fractured mandate can be addressed by increasing the threshold ceiling for political parties to be eligible to get PR votes and that can be done by amending election laws. Does it help?This is the idea coming from big political parties because they get more votes when fringe parties disqualify for PR votes. But a higher ceiling may deprive many small parties from representing certain communities. So, this goes against the spirit of inclusion. What we need is a good coalition culture. If we see the trend of recent decades, Indian politicians have become much more mature in this context. In the past, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi accommodated his electoral alliance partners in his ruling coalition even though his party won the majority single-handedly. If we scrap the inclusive electoral system, won’t the marginalised communities again revolt? We should be careful about that.At times, leaders have helped dissident groups split their party. These are the same leaders who issued an ordinance to change the provision that required a group within a political party to show support of 40 percent members of the party’s central committee “and” the parliamentary party. Only then could it split. They changed the threshold to 20 percent, and the “and” provision had been changed to “or”. The provision of requiring 40 percent support on both sides had earlier been included to ensure political stability. But the leaders who are helping party divisions are blaming the system for instability in the country. So, we [leaders] have to mend our ways, not blame the system. The Rastriya Swantantra Party, the fourth-largest in the lower house, has officially said that it wants to overhaul the federal system and drastically downsize the provinces. Also, leaders within the major parties who earlier stood in favour of federalism have started criticising it. On Saturday, Congress General Secretary Gagan Thapa said the country can’t sustain the provinces in their present form. What is your view?I am one of those who advocated for a federal system even before the first Constituent Assembly because Nepal is a country full of discrimination based on caste, class, region and religion. We advocated for the system to do away with these discriminations and find a system to maintain unity within diversity. Federalism is the best system to promote national unity as all groups get their own space as per their unique features. For instance, if you make multiple rooms in a building, you can give space and adjust more people. But if you keep many people inside a big room, they will have difficulties—no matter how big the room is. We should strengthen the federal system. We can’t regress.Then, why do many people see provinces as a burden?In Nepal, the federal system was projected as a structure that resulted in huge liability to the state coffers. But the facts don’t substantiate it. A local unit in the federal structure replaced many erstwhile Village Development Committees (VDCs). For instance, in my home district of Lamjung, eight palikas covered the areas of 61 VDCs, and the expenditure of the current eight local units is no more than that of the erstwhile 61 VDCs. Now we don’t need 77 district coordination committees. They can be scrapped. No province needs more than seven ministers. Likewise, the federal Cabinet can be drastically downsized. Why do we need a 25-strong Cabinet at the centre when we already have seven other provincial cabinets? Twelve ministries are enough at the centre, as suggested by the high level commission on administration reform.There are many departments and divisions that were designed under the unitary system that have become completely redundant in the federal setup. So many project offices established over two decades ago based on the needs of that time are still there. These irrelevant bodies should be scrapped. This is how we can significantly cut down on administrative costs. Leaders and people don’t discuss that. They only blame provinces. \nLawmaker Jiban Pariyar, a joint general secretary of the Nepali Congress, the main opposition, was a member of the four-member taskforce that prepared the terms of reference (ToR) of the parliamentary committee to probe the cooperative scam. The taskforce finalised it after a prolonged dispute over whether to categorically mention Deputy Prime Minister and Home Minister Rabi Lamichhane’s name while defining the committee’s jurisdiction. The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal talked to him about the ToR finalisation process and other aspects of the probe. It took weeks to finalise the ToR and jurisdiction of the parliamentary committee formed to probe the cooperative scam. How did you finally reach an agreement? I will give a brief context first. Cases of cooperative frauds had been made public even in the past. But this time, some groups and gangs were seen to be working in an organised way to embezzle billions of rupees deposited by common people. Some established people, including those active in politics, were found to be misusing the people’s hard-earned money. This issue was thus urgent and our party Nepali Congress raised it strongly in Parliament. We had raised this issue even when we were in the government [before March 4]. We had raised it with erstwhile home minister Narayankaji Shrestha in parliamentary committees and other platforms. We had talked to him about the involvement of lawmakers and other politicians in such scams.But the Congress raised this issue more strongly after the party quit the government.This is true, and for a good reason. We demanded a parliamentary committee to probe this issue after our party’s exit from the government because Rabi Lamichhane, someone linked with some big cooperative scams, became home minister. We raised this issue after he was allowed to lead the same ministry and police agencies that were supposed to be investigating the scams. Earlier, various agencies within Nepal Police and other government bodies were looking into the matter. Erstwhile home minister Shrestha had assured us of an independent and fair investigation. Lamichhane transferred police officials who were investigating the scams, and tried to protect cooperative operators involved in wrongdoing. Based on all these activities, we concluded that a parliamentary probe committee is a must and we firmly stood for the same. Initially, we raised this issue in Parliament without obstructing House proceedings but the government compelled us to disrupt the meetings after it refused to address our concerns. The prime minister tried to give Lamichhane a clean chit by saying that he was not involved in the cooperative scams. Also, the Nepal Police chief at a parliamentary committee meeting said that the home minister wasn’t under investigation as he had done nothing wrong. In the meantime, the attorney general issued a letter stating that no cooperative-related case was registered against Lamichhane. It became clear that the government agencies wouldn’t investigate the issue independently. Then, we raised the issue strongly and we even had to obstruct Parliament meetings. After the pressure, top leaders from the ruling as well as opposition parties agreed to form a parliamentary committee to investigate the matter. The leaders formed a task force led by Law, Justice and Parliamentary Affairs Minister Padam Giri and entrusted us with preparing the committee’s ToR and defining its jurisdiction.But at the task force meetings, members from the ruling parties lobbied to define the committee’s jurisdiction in a way that only allowed for investigation into the wrongdoings of cooperatives and their operators but not those involved in syphoning money from there through illegal means. They argued that only those who issued the loans should be made liable, not those who obtained it. Their intent was to protect Rabi Lamichhane. But I insisted that our duty is to find where the common people’s money has been spent or misused and then to return the money to the depositors. I insisted on investigating Lamichhane as various studies have shown his involvement in the misuse of depositors’ money.Then, we started exchanging written proposals. We exchanged and discussed many such proposals in writing. We insisted on mentioning the names of Lamichhane and the Gorkha Media Network—where Lamichhane and GB Rai invested tens of millions of cooperatives’ money—and ensuring that the depositors get their money back. After a long negotiation, members from the UML became a bit flexible. But the Rastriya Swatantra Party of Lamichhane continued to be rigid. Then, we finally agreed to mention the names of the cooperatives from where Lamichhane and his former colleagues had obtained money and to name Gorkha Media Network but not Lamichhane.But won’t keeping out the name of the sitting home minister create more confusion and disputes?There is no need to be confused. The ToR has stated the name of Gorkha Media Network, where Lamichhane and his team invested the money they got from the cooperatives, and the ToR’s Annex-2 has a list of cooperatives from where they obtained the money. It has also stated that “responsible officials of the company” involved in such transactions would also be investigated. Even other firms and individuals linked to the transactions will be probed. So there is no chance of keeping Lamichhane away from investigation. The committee’s jurisdiction defined in the ToR is clear on this.Will your party ask for Lamichhane’s resignation after the committee starts investigating him?Our party is yet to formally demand the home minister’s resignation. But questions have been raised about him in Parliament, in various public platforms and in the media. Also, the general public has raised this issue. He knows the committee will summon him for interrogation. A few months ago, when a minister [from Congress] was summoned by the Commission for Investigation of Abuse of Authority, Lamichhane was the one who strongly demanded the minister’s resignation in Parliament. He will soon face the parliamentary inquiry committee. Let’s see how he faces it. Leaders from ruling parties including the prime minister have accused the Congress of personally targeting Lamichhane after he refused to join a Congress-led coalition in which he was offered the prime ministerial position.Leaders from new parties should understand that political leaders engage in dialogue with all political forces. Some meetings are convened in a strategic way. This is natural in a democracy. Also, Lamichhane met with our party president. But they spread a rumour that our party president offered him the prime ministerial position. That’s not true. The argument that we targeted him after he refused to join our coalition is baseless. The Congress has officially decided that the probe committee can investigate any of our members suspected of wrongdoings. Has any other party made such a decision officially? We have also officially challenged the home minister to prove the allegations he labelled at our party leaders from Parliament’s rostrum. We have also challenged him to investigate and prove the charges.When the names of head and members of the parliamentary probe committee became public, many thought that the parties didn’t give due importance to the panel as they nominated relatively low-profile lawmakers. Why didn’t the parties choose powerful leaders to investigate a national crisis of this magnitude?This is a wrong perception. All members are federal parliamentarians. They shouldn’t be judged based on their personalities and profiles. The committee is powerful because it has a mandate from the House, and its jurisdiction and the ToR give it power. What we should carefully follow is their work. They can invite experts and specialists—such as chartered accountants, bankers, account specialists—if they require technical expertise during the investigation.Lamichhane himself is chair of the fourth-largest party, which has a decisive role in the ruling coalition. Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal and CPN-UML chair KP Sharma Oli had initially ruled out any need of investigation into the home minister. In this context, can the committee members freely conduct the investigation?I am confident that even the committee member from the RSP can’t defend his leader when the documents and facts show that the money was illegally released. How can other members protect him? I believe they will conduct the investigation independently and come up with a consensus report. Documents, facts and figures guide investigation. This isn’t like leaders giving statements on public platforms. We are not saying he must be proven guilty as the Congress has blamed him. He may prove to be innocent after investigation. We should accept if the evidence proves Lamichhane innocent. The bottom line is that the investigation should be fair. Many Congress leaders are also involved in cooperative scams and other corruption cases. So people suspect that leaders will eventually trade off and the probe panel will be only an eyewash.This investigation cannot be weakened under any pretext. I am saying this based on the documents and evidence I have studied. Also, the media and other stakeholders such as the study report of Pokhara Metropolitan City and the investigation report of Rupandehi District Police, among others, have already made ample evidence public. It’s not easy to acquit the guilty.What will Congress’ approach be if the committee, where ruling parties have a majority, fails to decide by consensus and members take decisions on a majority basis?In the seven-member panel, there are two members from our party and one from the Rastriya Prajatantra Party. If those from the ruling parties pushed for a wrong decision based on their majority, members from opposition parties will counter that and register their differing views. If such a situation arises they will be free to make the reality public and they can even bring out a different report.Was Congress under pressure to reach an agreement as there were reports that the government was preparing to unveil the budget through ordinance citing opposition’s House obstruction?We weren’t worried about that. In fact, the prime minister’s initiatives and his seriousness to end the House deadlock played a crucial role in helping us reach this agreement. \nAmnesty International’s Secretary General Agnès Callamard was in Nepal last week as a part of her first South Asian tour. During her four-day visit, she interacted with people from all walks of life, including the prime minister, in an attempt to gauge the human rights situation here. In this interview with Binod Ghimire of the Post, Callamard talked about the human rights situation in Nepal and the rest of the world. Excerpts: You have been travelling this part of the world, interacting with people. How do you evaluate the human rights situation here?Human rights are backsliding everywhere. It’s a global phenomenon. There is backsliding on civil and political rights, freedom of expression, press freedom and freedom of peaceful assembly. There is backsliding on women’s rights and non-discrimination on economic rights, and in terms of armed conflicts. The number of people dying in armed conflicts is increasing exponentially. We are in deep trouble as far as human rights protection is concerned. The South Asia region hasn’t been immune to the global trend.For my mission, I am visiting Sri Lanka and Nepal. In the two countries, we observe the shrinking of civic space and greater weaponisation of laws to curtail freedom of expression, particularly online. The digital laws are often overbroad and disproportionate. Banning TikTok in Nepal, for instance, is a disproportionate overbroad measure of the violation of international laws. We are observing a great deal of attacks in protests. The use of lethal force or disproportionate use of force by the police in response to even peaceful protests is increasing. There are incidents where protestors have died after the use of police force. There are issues of impunity for past crimes. A study by a European research centre shows that fewer people live in democracies worldwide in 2024 than in 1986. This is a complete U-turn. What do you see as the reasons for the backsliding? There are several factors that explain the backsliding. One could be growing restlessness and anxiety due to economic downturns. There was a severe financial crisis in 2008, and we didn't really recover from it. The inequalities within states and between states have increased in the last decade. We have seen a sharp increase in the wealth of the super-rich. On the other hand, the poor are getting poorer. This is feeding anger and creating fertile ground for populism. The authoritarian leaders are feeding on that particular ground. The backsliding is also linked to Covid that had a terrible impact on the economy and society. During Covid, the governments adopted different emergency measures but, in many cases, those measures were never lifted. In Europe, refugees, migrants and minorities are viewed as the reasons why the economy is not picking up and they are accused of stealing jobs. In every country, the minorities have been made the scapegoats. There is a resentment that democracy has not delivered for the people. The expectations are high, but the governments have failed to act accordingly. Therefore, the people are prepared to listen to the authoritarian leaders. By authoritarian leaders, I do not mean those who are in power by force but those who are democratically elected. They are elected by the people, but they practise authoritarianism once they get into power. In Nepal, the burning problem of authoritarianism has been reflected even in local politics. For instance, the mayor of Kathmandu has resorted to repeated attacks against street vendors and landless people. These are authoritarian moves. Such leaders target vulnerable groups who cannot protect themselves. You are in Nepal at a time the government has arrested the owner of the largest media house. How does Amnesty International look at this situation?We are very alarmed and upset. We call on the government to release him immediately. Even if the charges are valid, they certainly do not justify imprisoning him. Amnesty International believes that the use of those charges is politically motivated and is an attempt to stifle dissent. It is a response to the professional investigation and reporting about the policies and practices of those in power. This is an attempt to silence him, to silence the news media and to silence journalists. By so doing, the authorities are also violating the rights of the Nepali society to access information at a time when they need that kind of information. The attack on Sirohiya is an act of reprisal, censorship and violation of his own rights and the right of the Nepali people to freedom of information and freedom of press, which is also a collective form of rights.We believe that he might have been arrested in relation to the reporting of financial fraud by people in power. Many people with whom I have interacted say that that safe space of expression is shrinking in Nepal. There are incidents where people have been arrested for criticising people in authority.Unregulated generative artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a big threat. How can it be regulated?Globally, information technology and AI present many opportunities for people. But they also present risks. Amnesty International has focused on the risks. We have identified discrimination and biases. Data upon which some of these AI tools are based are inherently biased. They are based on a sample of a certain group of people, which can not be the ground for effective policy making. We are campaigning against the use of AI for facial recognition for mass surveillance. It is a violation of the freedom of movement and freedom of privacy, and many communities around the world are disproportionately affected.We have done several studies that show that mass surveillance and facial recognition are used in the most impoverished African-American communities in the United States, Muslim communities in India and Palestinian communities in Israel and occupied territories. Cyber surveillance and spyware are other problems which have been widely used to target journalists and human rights defenders, as well as opponents. We have been demanding that spyware be regulated. So far, this has been excluded from different regulations related to information technology.Generative AI has huge implications for the world, societies and human beings. Currently, only the European Union has made attempts to regulate it by adopting an AI Act last December. This is imperfect but is a first step. We have criticised it because it excludes cyber surveillance and the use of AI for security purposes, and it doesn’t stop the use of AI targeted at refugees and migrants. Nevertheless, other aspects of the law are positive. Do you think other countries should follow the European Union’s footsteps?Yes, they can build on it without going below the benchmark. We encourage all countries to prepare and enact better laws. We are calling on governments to take it as an example, but after correcting the shortcomings.Why do you think Nepal’s transitional justice process has been stuck? What can human rights organisations like Amnesty do to push it forward?Sadly, the transitional justice process hasn’t progressed in several countries. I think the leaders are so keen to preserve the peace that they are prepared to give up on justice. They fear that if they open the gate to judicial reparation and investigation, what has been achieved so far will be dismantled. That’s the fear that I have seen everywhere. Everywhere, including in Nepal, the leaders create opposition between peace and justice.You can see many governments are opposing the International Criminal Court prosecutors’ arrest warrant in relation to Gaza, saying it will create problems in agreeing on a ceasefire. This is nonsense.Peace and justice are two sides of the same coin. In fact, peace is not sustainable without justice. When justice is not delivered, the conflict is bound to recur. It is just a matter of time. We often hear the excuse that if a particular leader or a person is prosecuted, that would affect peace. On the contrary, not investigating the perpetrator is a real challenge to peace. Many people who are in power after a peace deal themselves are guilty of war crimes. They don’t want to be held accountable. It is not in their interest to deliver transitional justice. It takes an incredible, highly moral and principled leadership to take the process ahead.We have seen here that the transitional justice process has been paralysed. Successive governments have failed to act on the Comprehensive Peace Accord. They haven’t acted on what the Supreme Court told them in 2015. It had directed them to review, revise and reform the Transitional Justice Act.Here I have seen the categorisation of crimes as serious and non-serious, which is very strange. It is shocking to me that some killings are considered non-serious, and could lead to de facto amnesty for those responsible for them, even though these crimes fall under international law. If someone was killed after torture then two crimes have been committed—torture and killing. Right to life is the most important right. The investigation should be done accordingly. The same is the case with sexual violence with rape and without rape.What is alarming is that people are losing trust. If people do not trust the systems that are supposed to deliver justice, that will cause a big problem. The Truth and Reconciliation Commission and the Commission of Investigation on Enforced Disappeared Persons couldn’t undertake proper investigation and prosecution. Not all have received the government’s relief, which has led to much frustration and animosity. There is political interference on transitional justice, which also lacks independence and transparency.We are calling on the authorities to act as directed by the Supreme Court, ratify the statute on the International Criminal Court as well as the International Convention on Disappearance. Do you see chances of international interference if Nepal continues to delay justice delivery?There is no doubt that some crimes committed during the war fall within universal jurisdiction. If the perpetrators of those crimes travel to countries where a framework of universal jurisdiction has been enacted, they could be arrested there. We are seeing the multiplication of universal jurisdiction cases in Europe.Cases of custodial deaths, torture and extrajudicial killings are common in Nepal. How can they be checked?Different organisations like Amnesty International should be monitoring the abuse of power by the police and state authorities. There must be impartial and fair investigation of such incidents. But there is a regime of impunity. The police are not very keen to investigate themselves. I wanted to mention the case of Ajit Mijar, which is an example of justice being denied. It also shows the complicity of the institution in denying justice.Nepal is ranked the fourth most vulnerable country due to climate change though it contributes negligibly in greenhouse gas emissions. The largest polluters haven't fulfilled their responsibilities towards Nepal. How can organisations like Amnesty advocate for countries like Nepal?Amnesty International has long been advocating for climate justice. We have a set of demands. We are advocating at the United Nations level and also at the COP. We are pushing through COP our message of loss and damage, about the responsibilities of industrialised countries to cut their reliance on fossil fuel industries and so on. The impact of global warming will lead to loss of lives in places like Nepal and Pacific Islands.We saw very timid steps taken in COP in UAE last year. These steps are far from sufficient. We see countries multiplying their investments in fossil fuel while big fossil fuel companies are also violating their written commitment to decrease the reliance on fossil fuels. This is alarming.However, we have made some progress on loss and damage. Governments are recognising the principle of loss and damage for the countries that are least responsible for climate change. They can rely on some kind of global financial system to protect and support them in case of a sudden climate related crisis. We are now advocating for the responsible countries to set aside the necessary funds.Nepal is at the receiving end of climate change though the country is not responsible for it. However, the Nepali government also has a responsibility towards its people. The extreme weather risk faced by Nepal demands urgent acts from the authorities. The most vulnerable communities are at particular risk. The government must have instruments to protect them.  \nThe CPN (Unified Socialist), which was fashioned in 2021 by a splinter faction of the CPN-UML, is preparing to hold its first general convention. The party has done poorly in all elections since its establishment. It has also failed in service delivery despite continuously being in the government since its inception. The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal caught up with the party’s General Secretary, Ghanashyam Bhusal, for insights about the Unified Socialist’s upcoming general convention and broader political dynamics. Your party is holding its first general convention in a few weeks. What new things does the party have to offer?Our party was born in the context of sharp division between political forces over the issue of Parliament dissolution by then prime minister KP Sharma Oli, chairman of the CPN-UML, which was then also our party. That was the immediate reason for the party split. But there were other disputes within the UML. The differences were about the political line and party orientation. After Oli’s election as the party leader, policy issues were undermined. In fact, we were at odds because of the policy issues.What were those policy disputes?We [our faction] believed that after the establishment of democratic republic system, the fight for a political system was almost over as this is the most progressive political system of our time. We stressed that now the political line and programmes of the party should be updated and the focus shifted to attaining prosperity. Democracy can’t be sustained if we can’t promote industry, create jobs and ensure good governance. So we have to orient our policies to ensure these achievements. In our country, comprador capitalists, who want to earn money without running industries, are dominant. They shift the state’s policies in collusion with politicians, bureaucrats, police and other state agencies. Likewise, the economic policy doesn’t talk about jobs and production but only growth and development. These factors are detrimental to our economy. We wanted to change these policies and dynamics. We had differences on these issues with Oli. When we were debating them with him, the Parliament dissolution created a sort of abnormal situation. We stood against it, defying our party chief Oli. That division eventually led to the party split. Many people, including leaders in our own party, saw Parliament dissolution as the only reason behind the birth of our party. The new party was confused about the way forward. The upcoming general convention will formulate clear policies in this connection. What about the leadership? Will the party get new leadership?For the past two decades, I have been advocating that a communist party should adopt the right programmes to bring about social changes. At the time, the Maoists had a policy of seizing state power through force, and the UML was talking only about transforming society through elections. But the UML was basically engaged only in winning elections. In this context, we [a group of UML leaders] came up with some policies that would make substantive changes in such ritualistic practices.Now, I have been saying that our party should be led by a leader who can internalise and effectively implement those policies. We have almost finalised the party’s policy documents. When the documents are circulated among party workers, the debate about who is eligible to implement these policies will start.You often claim to be the proponent of the CPN (Unified Socialist)’s party line. If so, will you claim party leadership to implement those policies?The first condition to become the party leader is that he/she should internalise the policies and programmes adopted by the party. I shouldn’t say that no one besides me has internalised them. It is true that I have been actively leading the debates and discussions to introduce new policies in the party. Party representatives will debate and decide this at the convention.A large number of senior leaders quit the UML to form this party. But it couldn’t even retain its members let alone further expand.There was a need for radical reforms and restructuring in communist organisations and their policies. This should have been done by the country’s largest communist party—the CPN-UML. But the party leadership and its rank and file didn’t realise the need for it. There was no serious policy discussion in the UML. While the leadership of the CPN (Unified Socialist) and its organisation are oriented in the right direction, it’s not properly trained for such restructuring. Therefore, many even accused the party leadership of being just a follower and subservient to the Nepali Congress and the Maoist Centre. Various sections of society who had praised us for standing against Oli’s wrong decision didn’t appreciate other political moves of our party. Parliament dissolution was a political event. A party needs clear programmes and agenda to keep public support. Unfortunately, we were found wanting in this regard. We should have done something in job creation and increasing production. We will make such things clear at the upcoming convention. Since its formation, the party has been constantly bickered over power sharing with other parties and even party leaders always seem to be wrangling for ministerial berths. Don’t you think such activities weaken the party?This happened as the party lacked clear policies to move ahead. Standing against Oli became sort of its policy as there was deep resentment against him. As far as the leaders’ attachment to power is concerned, the party was born out of power [from Parliament, not from the ground]. So the struggle for power is linked to its genesis. It has been in power ever since its establishment. These allegations were hence natural, and the party leadership couldn’t clarify things. We couldn’t show what we did for the betterment of the society.Party chair Madhav Kumar Nepal and other top leader Jhalanath Khanal seem to be working at cross-purposes. Nepal seems closer to the Congress while Khanal has been consistently lobbying for an alliance with the UML and the Maoist Centre.We have almost resolved this issue in the course of finalising the party’s policy document. Our conclusion is that, in general, the Congress mainly represents neoliberals and comprador capitalists. When we lobby for the country’s independent economic policy, the Congress may not agree. The party tilts more towards pro-western ideas in the name of liberalism. We in our party are in consensus that in the long-run we will compete against the Congress. But we shouldn’t forget that we got the current democratic system and the constitution only after fighting jointly with the Congress. So we have to keep our doors open for collaboration with the Congress in order to safeguard this system and the constitution. It is also historically proven that the Congress and left forces should stand together to safeguard democratic system. Thus we have now made our theoretical standing clearer.But in practical aspects, as you said, there are some differences. Party chair doesn’t want to increase distance with the Congress as he worked closely with Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba and other leaders to fight Oli ji. But Jhalanath Khanal ji is for left alliance.While there are already major communist forces such as the CPN-UML and the Maoist Centre, why is one more communist force, CPN (Unified Socialist), needed? How do you prove your relevance?The CPN-UML didn’t follow the right policies, even those endorsed by its general conventions. Party chief Oli wants total control of the party organisation, from the centre to the local units. The entire party is mobilised mainly to realise Oli’s personal ambitions. This party can’t work in favour of the society in the long run. The Maoist Centre hasn’t succeeded in transforming itself from war-era rigidity of Maoism. The Unified Socialist is here to correct these two major deviations of Nepal’s communist movement. Had the party raised this issue prominently right since its formation, people would have understood its relevance. We will do it now. This convention will be a landmark event in this connection as well. Many people think that the Unified Socialist will ultimately merge with the UML.Merger is not a solution. Even if you want to bring two parties together, you have to unify them. A merger brings top leaders together based on power sharing, just like the merger of the UML and Maoist Centre in 2018. Such a merger is guided mainly by the interests of certain leaders. That’s why the merger didn’t last. The need now is unification among communist parties based on policies and programmes. Otherwise, it will be nothing more than a gathering of leaders. There is no point in merging the party to make the UML bigger and make Oli prime minister one more time.As a leader of a ruling coalition partner, how confident are you of the stability of this alliance?Given the composition of the present Parliament, we can’t rule out the making and breaking of different coalitions until the next election. Oli ji used to talk of the Unified Socialist as a tumour removed after a surgery. His mindset that he can do anything in Nepali politics has suffered a setback. Therefore, he became ready for this coalition. If he has realised this change, this coalition will last. But if he again tries to manoeuvre to justify his dissolution of Parliament and serve any other interests, there might even be other coalitions.Why has your party been in a state of disharmony with coalition partners right from the beginning?Initially, the prime minister didn’t consult with us while making this coalition. That created misunderstanding. He eventually admitted his mistake in failing to inform us on time and sought our support. So, that chapter was closed. Now we have no issue at the party’s level, and officially, we are committed to this coalition. \nOver three decades of experience, United Nations Resident Coordinator in Nepal, Hanaa Singer-Hamdy, highlights Nepal's progress in poverty reduction, health, education, and infrastructure, while emphasizing challenges such as inequality, climate change, and financing gaps.

Write it in the form of inspiring story not news article or event.\n    \n    Story:\nOnce upon a time, nestled between the towering peaks of the Himalayas and the lush jungles of the Terai, there was a country named Nepal. Though still a developing nation, Nepal was a land of profound beauty and deep-rooted cultural heritage. The residents of Nepal faced many challenges, but beneath these hardships lay a resilient spirit and an unyielding hope for the future.\n\nThis enchanting land, where Mount Everest reaches towards the skies and the air carries a mix of incense and cool mountain breezes, was more than a geographical marvel. It was a mosaic of cultures, languages, and traditions, a testament to human endeavor against all odds. Nepal's history, from the unification under King Prithvi Narayan Shah to its transformation into a federal democratic republic, told a story of aspiration and endurance.\n\nIn recent years, the people of Nepal, with their indomitable will, had taken strides towards rebuilding and reimagining their country. They turned their struggles into stepping stones, each challenge a chapter in their ongoing saga. The shift from a monarchy to a republic had not only changed governance but had woven a new tapestry of democratic values and collective decision-making.\n\nEconomically, while agriculture continued to sustain a large part of its population, Nepal had begun to harness the potential of its picturesque landscapes, developing sustainable tourism that promised to preserve their natural heritage while boosting local economies. Communities living in the shadows of the Himalayas had become stewards of the earth, protecting the biodiversity that made their country unique.\n\nEach day brought new stories. Whether it was a festival in Kathmandu, a technological advance in Pokhara, or a conservation effort in Chitwan, these events were threads in the vibrant quilt of Nepali life. These stories, updated daily, reflected the pulse of progress and the spirit of hope that characterized this resilient nation.\n\nAnd so, as Nepal moved forward, each moment was not just a passage of time but a promise of potential, a narrative of a nation perennially climbing towards tomorrow, guided by the legacy of its past and the dreams of its future.\n\nNews events:\nWith a bit of luck Nepal’s fairytale victory would have been secured.The country’s hopes of progressing to the Super Eight stage of the 2024 ICC Men’s T20 World Cup ended after they lost to cricketing powerhouse South Africa by one run in a nail-biting last-ball thriller in their Group D match at the Arnos Vale Ground in Kingstown, St Vincent on Saturday.But their spirited performance earned praise worldwide after almost pulling off an upset win over one of the tournament favourites.Fielding first after winning the toss, the Rhinos restricted a strong Proteas team to a subpar 115-7 with their stupendous spin attack as Dipendra Singh Airee and part-time bowler Kushal Bhurtel shared all seven wickets that fell between them on a turning track.But they fell agonisingly short from recording their historic first ever victory over an ICC’s full-member nation after they could only manage 114-7.Despite the heartbreak, Nepal’s performance caught attention worldwide.“A performance to be proud of. Keep your heads high,” world cricket governing body International Cricket Council wrote on X, formerly Twitter.South Africa legend Dale Steyn called the Nepal vs South Africa game the “Match of the Tournament” on ICC’s Digital Daily show.“It would’ve been the talk of the tournament if Nepal would’ve gotten over the line. It would’ve been fantastic, and they deserved to win,” Steyn said. “[This was] the match of the tournament to be honest with you. I saw people crying in the stands, it shows how much it means to them, and that’s what cricket is all about.”Indian cricket commentator and journalist Harsha Bhogle said Nepal have a brighter future ahead of them.“Hold your heads high Nepal. That was South Africa you almost took down today. You have some of the most passionate fans and you let them believe. Hopefully bigger days are round the corner.”Indian Premier League franchise cricket team Chennai Super Kings wrote on X: “Unreal fans support! Unreal game of unreal night! Nepal, you have won all our hearts!”“Nepal's performance—all cricketing commentators, most of the IPL franchise teams, cricketing bodies are talking about the team, talking about that fan following!” a Nepal supporter based in Australia wrote on X. “Isn't it great? Didn't we win something?”ICC and Asian Cricket Council commentator Mikkhail Vaswani wrote on his Facebook page: “Nepal are the youngest team in this World Cup. They have put on some great performances. Time to back the boys for a very strong and committed effort.”At an average age of 23.7, Nepal are the youngest team at the World Cup. The team is led by Rohit Paudel, who, at 21, is the youngest captain in the 20-team tournament, while Gulsan Jha, 18, is the youngest player.After the match, Paudel stressed that Nepal needed more exposure against the best teams of the world if they are to be on the right side of the result.“We were very close but a little far,” Paudel said after the close contest. “In crunch moments, we did well, the way we fought was very good.”He added, “If we get more exposure regularly, then next games we will be on the other side [of the result].”Nepal were a far less experienced side as they were making their only second appearance at the world stage.Chasing, the batters took Nepal to 85-2 in the 14th over in the chase, riding on 32 runs from their power play without losing a wicket and a half-century stand between opener Aasif Sheikh and Anil Sah that came off just 36 deliveries.But the introduction of spinner Tabraiz Shamsi (4-19) would prove to be lethal in Nepal’s chase.Shamsi first dismissed Bhurtel for 13 with his only second delivery in the eighth over and Paudel for a duck two balls later to hurl South Africa back in the game.Sheikh and Sah rebuilt the Nepal innings.Sah hit three boundaries off Anrich Nortje and a six off Shamshi to raise the tempo before Sheikh smashed Kagiso Rabada for a four and a six that took Nepal past 80 total after 13 overs with still eight wickets in hand.After Sah fell to Aiden Markram (1-8) making 27 runs off 24 balls, Sheikh and Airee dragged Nepal to 98-3 from 17 overs.But Shamshi returned with the ball in the 18th over and mercilessly raided the stumps of Airee and dangerman Sheikh to turn the game back into South Africa’s favour. Sheikh finished his innings with 42 runs off 49 balls.Nepal needed 16 runs off the last 12 balls but Nortje (1-27) and Ottneil Baartman held their nerves in the final two overs to save the Proteas from the jaws of defeat.Nortje bowled four dots in the penultimate over including a wicket of Kushal Malla that left Nepal requiring 16 runs off the last eight balls.Sompal Kami hit Nortje with a long six and collected two runs off the last ball of the 19th over that brought the equation down to eight off the final six deliveries. Gulsan Jha next cracked a four off Baartman in the 19.3 overs and managed another two off the next delivery to inch Nepal closer to overhauling the target.Nepal only needed two runs off the last two deliveries to keep alive their hopes of reaching the Super Eight but Baartman threw two dots with perfect bouncers to break Nepali hearts.Gulsan Jha tried to take the game to Super Over with a desperate attempt to add a run off a bye of the final delivery but Quinton de Kock and Heinrich Klaasen combined to run him out at the non-striker’s end.Earlier, Bhurtel took 4-19 and Airee bowled 3-21 to trouble South Africa throughout the innings.South Africa added 22 runs for the first wicket before Airee got the breakthrough wicket when he caught and bowled de Kock for 10 in the fourth over.Bhurtel then bowled captain Markram for 15 in the 12th over, ending their 46-run stand for the second wicket.South Africa seemed headed for a good total when they were at 68-2 in the 12th over but Bhurtel’s wrist spin and Airee’s off break kept their powerful opponents under control.Bhurtel removed Klaasen for three before Airee got the big fish Hendricks, who top scored for South Africa with 43 runs off 49 balls, and removed David Miller for seven the next.South Africa needed sixth number batter Tristan Stubbs’s 27 not out off 18 balls for a boost to their innings.Bhurtel then underlined Nepal’s impressive bowling, claiming the wickets of Marco Jansen (1) and Rabada (0) in successive deliveries off the final two balls.Sandeep Lamichhane also started for the first time after missing Nepal’s matches in the United States due to visa issues and bowled splendidly conceding only 18 runs in his four-over spell.“I am very proud of the unit, especially the way we bowled and batted, I'm very proud of that,” Paudel said.South Africa skipper Markram was also full of praise for Nepal’s bowling.“First and foremost, the way [Nepal] bowled it made it really tough for us. They put us under a lot of pressure,” Markram said.The defeat leaves Nepal fourth in the five-team group D with one point, which they earned after rain washed out their second group match against Sri Lanka. Nepal had lost their opening game to the Netherlands by six wickets.South Africa, who had already progressed to the Super Eight round, finished the group stage unbeaten, collecting eight points from four matches.Nepal next face Bangladesh on Monday and will look to end their T20 World Cup campaign on a high note.Bangladesh are second with four points from three matches and a victory over Nepal would secure them a spot in the next round.The Netherlands, on two points, are also in contention and next face Sri Lanka who are also without a win and lie at the bottom of the group. \nNepal’s unemployment rate has been increasing, according to a report.The fourth Nepal Living Standard Survey report, published by the National Statistics Office on Thursday, shows that the unemployment rate climbed up to 12.6 percent in 2022-23 from 11.4 percent in 2017-18, representing a 1.2 percent rise in the five-year period.The unemployment rate has risen from 4.9 percent in 1995-96 to 12.6 percent in 2022-23.This rise is more pronounced among younger workers, with the unemployment rate for those aged 15-24 jumping from 7.3 percent in 1995-96 to 22.7 percent in 2022-23. The report said this highlights the challenge of finding jobs for youths in Nepal. The survey report shows joblessness among people between the ages of 15 and 24 declined to 22.7 percent in 2022-23 from 23.9 percent in 2017-18.“Most worrying is the rise in unemployment in the past five years, which increased by 1.2 percent, and that’s worrisome,” said Hem Raj Regmi, deputy chief statistician at the statistics office. “The economy has failed to generate enough jobs for its large and expanding young population.”The population structure has shifted towards a younger working-age population, with a decrease in the proportion of children (0-14 years) and an increase in the proportion of adults (15-59 years).This trend is further supported by a declining dependency ratio, suggesting a growing workforce. The proportion of the elderly population (60 years and above) has increased.Regmi said the age between 15 and 24, the most productive time for an individual, is not considered the working age in Nepal, as these people are involved in education and training.“At this age, our survey has found, people will work only if they are offered a job. The responsibility to earn money grows in later years.”The survey data on employment status reveals significant shifts in the labour market between 1995-96 and 2022-23. The percentage of those with jobs has declined considerably from 67.2 percent in 1995-96 to 32.4 percent in 2022-23, while the percentage of those not in the labour force has increased from 29.4 percent to 62.9 percent.The share of wage employment in agriculture has significantly declined from 70.7 percent in 1995-96 to 1.9 percent in 2022-23. The share of wage employment in non-agriculture, on the other hand, has risen considerably from 9.5 percent in 1995-96 to 56.6 percent in 2022-23.The survey report shows that 32.4 percent of the population is employed, 62.9 percent is not in the labour force, and 4.7 percent is unemployed.The labour force participation rate came down to 37.1 percent in 2022-23 from 38.2 percent five years ago.“The employment condition in Nepal is the worst,” said economist Pushkar Bajracharya. “The government failed to create jobs. This is because the investment environment has not been favourable in past years, mainly due to political and policy uncertainty. When there is no investment, there is no job creation.”Bajracharya said the unemployment rate would further jump due to the repercussions of the Covid-19 pandemic and the recession and slowdown the country has seen.“Many industries, service sectors and companies are still laying off workers due to the economic slowdown. There is low demand for labour in the country as the key economic sectors—construction and manufacturing—are facing recession, while wholesale and retail have shown a slight recovery,” said Bajracharya. Experts say that while the overall unemployment rate is low, the jobs being created in Nepal’s economy are not of quality. There is a need for new strategies, new partners, and new goals.Each year, around a million Nepali youths, including students, leave the country to try their luck abroad.The survey data on remittances and transfers reveals a significant increase in the prevalence and magnitude of remittances received by households in Nepal between 1995-96 and 2022-23.The percentage of households receiving remittances has increased dramatically from 23.4 percent in 1995-96 to 76.8 percent in 2022-23, indicating a significant rise in the number of Nepali families relying on the money sent by their members working abroad.This increase is consistent with the observed growth in average remittances per household, which has significantly increased from Rs15,160 in 1995-96 to Rs145,093 in 2022-23.Remittances (other than from India) are quite dominant, highlighting the importance of international migration for income generation.Remittances from India declined from 32.9 percent in 1995-96 to 11.1 percent in 2010-11, but they have increased since, reaching 21.3 percent in 2022-23, according to the survey report.The survey data on household loans shows that the percentage of families borrowing money is relatively stable (61.3 percent in 1995-96 and 63.8 percent in 2022-23). However, the percentage of households with outstanding loans has significantly increased, from 58.4 percent in 1995-96 to 97.3 percent in 2022-23.The data also reveals a shift in the sources of household loans. Traditional money lenders were previously a dominant source (39.7 percent in 1995-96), but their share significantly decreased to 11.4 percent in 2022-23.The share of loans from banks has increased (from 16.1 percent in 1995-96 to 22.4 percent in 2022-23), while loans from relatives continue to remain significant (40.8 percent in 1995-96 to 42.5 percent in 2022-23).Household consumption as a reason for borrowing has been declining (from 49.4 percent in 1995-96 to 23.5 percent in 2022-23). This could be attributed to improved access to essential goods and services or a shift to other borrowing needs, the survey report shows.The use of collateral has also shifted, with an increase in the proportion of loans taken with collateral. While 16.8 percent of loans were taken with land and house collateral in 1995-96, this share increased to 35.1 percent in 2022-23.The data shows a noticeable shift in the dominant sectors of non-farm activities. While trade was previously the most prevalent sector (52.1 percent in 1995-96), it has declined (42.5 percent in 2022-23). The share of manufacturing has also decreased from 29.9 percent in 1995-96 to 22.6 percent in 2022-23.Similar is the case with the service sector enterprises, which decreased from 29.2 percent in 2003-04 to 7.2 percent in 2022-23. The percentage of registered enterprises has increased significantly from 11.7 percent in 1995-96 to 52.6 percent in 2022-23, indicating greater adherence to regulations and potentially better access to resources and support.Data on wage employment in 2022-23 provides insights into the nature of work and earnings in Nepal. The average number of daily working days for wage earners in the past year is 72.Daily wage jobs keep 64.9 percent of people busy. This suggests a need for more secure and stable employment opportunities for most of the workforce. While long-term jobs with monthly salaries account for 28.7 percent, contract-based work constitutes only 6.4 percent.According to the survey, nominal income levels in Nepal increased substantially from 1995-96 to 2022-23. The average household income increased more than twelvefold, from Rs43,732 in 1995-96 to Rs551,148 in 2022-23.Similarly, the average per capita income rose significantly from Rs7,690 to Rs136,707 over the period. This growth was uneven across income groups: the per capita income of the poorest 20 percent of the population grew from Rs2,020 to Rs61,335, while that of the wealthiest 20 percent surged from Rs19,325 to Rs259,867.The composition of household income also shifted markedly, with the share of farm income dropping from 61 percent in 1995-96 to 16.8 percent in 2022-23, reflecting a transition to non-farm and other income sources. Remittances make up an important share of this income.The survey also shows a shift in cropping patterns—the percentage of land holdings growing paddy has decreased from 76 percent in 1995-96 to 64.3 percent in 2022-23. The percentage of holdings growing summer vegetables has increased from 35.6 in 1995-96 to 39.3 in 2022-23. Likewise, the percentage of holdings with cattle has declined significantly from 73.5 in 1995-96 to 37.8 in 2022-23.The literacy rate for the population aged 5 years and above has substantially increased (from 37.8 percent in 1995-96 to 77.4 percent in 2022-23). This positive trend is also visible in the adult literacy rate (15 years and above), which has risen (from 35.6 percent in 1995-96 to 72.5 percent in 2022-23), highlighting significant progress in literacy among the adult population.This improvement is more noticeable among males, with the literacy rate increasing from 53.5 percent in 1995-96 to 82.9 percent in 2022-23. For the females, the increase is from 19.4 percent in 1995-96 to 64.1 percent in 2022-23.The data also shows a significant increase in school attendance among the population aged 15 years and above, with 33.9 percent having attended school in 1995-96 compared to 70.2 percent in 2022-23.This trend is again more noticeable among males, with school attendance increasing from 50.2 percent in 1995-96 to 81.4 percent in 2022-23. For females, attendance increased from 19.1 percent in 1995-96 to 61.1 percent in 2022-23.The survey data on health services paints a mixed picture of health status and access to healthcare in Nepal between 1995-96 and 2022-23. The population reporting chronic illnesses grew from 6.5 percent in 1995-96 to 18.5 percent in 2022-23, indicating a potential rise in non-communicable diseases.There has also been a significant increase in the percentage reporting acute illnesses—from 9 percent in 1995-96 to 24.9 percent in 2022-23, suggesting a potential shift in disease patterns or reporting practices. A decline is observed in diarrhoea from 17 percent in 1995-96 to 6.6 percent in 2022-23, potentially indicating improved sanitation and hygiene practices.Cold/fever remains a significant concern, increasing from 43.7 percent in 1995-96 to 51.5 percent in 2022-23. The percentage of those consulting a doctor has remained relatively stable (around 29 percent), and the percentage consulting a paramedic has significantly decreased.Migration patterns within Nepal reveal significant shifts in trends between 2003-04 and 2022-23. While the overall percentage of the migrant population within the country has remained relatively stable—36.6 percent in 2003-04 and 38.1 percent in 2022-23—there is a notable shift in the gender composition of migrants.Males constituted a higher proportion of migrants in 2003-04 (50.1 percent), but females made a larger share of the migrant population (49.6 percent) in 2022-23. A decline in the percentage of migrants from rural areas in 2022-23 indicates a potential shift in migration patterns, possibly driven by changing economic opportunities and societal factors.The analysis of reasons for migration reveals that family remains the dominant factor (75.2 percent in 2003-04 moving within the country for family reasons and 74.9 percent in 2022-23).The fourth Nepal Living Standards Survey, conducted in 2022-23, is the first such survey since the country’s transition to a federal system. Data was collected from a nationally representative sample of 9,600 households on a wide range of topics. \nCPN-UML Chairman KP Sharma Oli once again vented his ire at the budget for the new fiscal year on Saturday, fuelling speculations of growing discord among the ruling parties.On May 29, the day after Finance Minister Barsha Man Pun read out the national budget in Parliament, Oli lambasted some of the provisions and said the fiscal plan was of “one minister and one party”.Oli and his party were unhappy with some of the provisions, including the distribution of funds to the conflict victims, who mostly are CPN (Maoist Centre) members. Oli’s UML is the largest partner in the Pushpa Kamal Dahal-led coalition government.Addressing the UML parliamentary party meeting on Saturday, Oli said the budget had failed to address the concerns of the poor. “Our duty is to stop poverty and lead the country towards development. If the poor are not benefitting and development is not happening, how can we satisfy them?” Oli wondered.He also asked the party’s ministers to see the status of the ministries they lead. “We have to keep track of the budget allocated to the ministries led by the UML,” Oli said, directing the party’s lawmakers to openly discuss the budget in the party and in Parliament.He also accused the government of failing to pay enough attention to development activities. “Our party joined the government to stop poverty and advance development. If that is not happening, how can we be satisfied?” Oli said.Stating that the percentage of the poor had now increased, Oli claimed that poverty had been reduced significantly during his premiership, which lasted over three years until July 2021.A UML central committee leader told the Post that Oli has already expressed his dissatisfaction with the budget with Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal. Oli’s second instance of expressing his displeasure with the budget signals a growing misunderstanding between the two leaders, UML leaders said. Oli wants more spending in the sectors of entrepreneurship and infrastructure.He urged the UML ministers to study the budget but directed the party’s lawmakers not to comment on it on social media platforms. “It’d be better to express your concerns and comments at party meetings,” Oli told UML lawmakers.Also on Saturday, Gagan Thapa, a general secretary of the opposition Nepali Congress, raised questions about the government’s activities. The UML is in government, but the party is acting as if it is not a part of it, he said. “The UML first sent junior party leaders to the Cabinet. Now it has stopped owning up the government’s activities,” Thapa shared his observation.When the UML goes to people, it takes no responsibility for the government’s works, he said. “They are acting as though the UML was not consulted while the Maoists prepared the budget.”The party had deputed former finance minister Bishnu Poudel to provide inputs and suggestions for the budget. \nWhat’s cooking in the Rastriya Swatantra Party? Why are the leaders of the fourth-largest party in the House of Representatives and the third-largest partner in the Pushpa Kamal Dahal-led Cabinet giving statements hinting at their possible exit from the government?Some remarks made by the RSP ministers have fuelled speculation. On Saturday, Minister for Youth and Sports Biraj Bhakta Shrestha of the same party remarked that the time has come to review their participation in the government and its support to the coalition. Addressing a function organised to mark the establishment day of the RSP, he went on to say that they were ready to quit the government if needed. “We are always carrying our resignation letter in our pocket, and the paper may be pulled out any time,” he said. On Friday, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Home Affairs Lamichhane, who is also the RSP president, complained that though they were in the government, others were controlling state power in a true sense. Many wondered if Lamichhane had started getting frustrated with the government.Addressing a press briefing organised on the occasion of Lamichhane’s 100 days in the home ministry, he said, “Though we are in government, we don’t know who is exercising the state power. Power has been controlled by some others for a long time, and it is a bit difficult to break that nexus.” However, some lawmakers from the party the Post spoke to voiced ignorance of why the party’s ministers were making such remarks. The RSP put on an impressive performance at the 2022 election, capitalising on the public’s frustration with traditional parties. Minister Shrestha said they were treading a tough path and were ready to quit the government if they were coerced into making unnecessary compromises.Shrestha said that after they joined the government, they realised that the country’s misgovernance was more serious than prevailing social malpractices. In the last week of December in 2022, Dahal became prime minister for the third time with the support of the CPN-UML and the RSP, among other parties. Dahal later ditched them and joined hands with the Nepali Congress to form a new Cabinet.After 14 months, Dahal sent the Nepali Congress out of power and brought the UML and the RSP into the coalition on March 4 this year. Hundred days after the latest change in the power equation, statements from the leaders and ministers of the third-largest coalition partner have made watchers curious about their intentions. Asked what was going on inside their party, RSP lawmakers expressed their ignorance. They said they had no idea about the party’s future moves and leaders’ mood as there had not been enough meetings, discussions, and interactions recently.“We would know what is going on in the party and the government only if there were party meetings,” the lawmakers told the Post asking not to be named. “Only a select group of leaders make party’s decisions, and we are kept in the dark.” Kabindra Burlakoti, the party's deputy general secretary, however, tried to downplay Shrestha's statement as generic. He said Saturday’s statement by the minister is nothing different from the ones party leaders have been saying since joining the government. His statement does not imply that the party is seeking to recall its ministers, added Burlakoti. “Until our party has a free hand to work in the government, we are not considering withdrawing our support,” Burlakoti told the Post.Experts, however, say Lamichhane is trying to cover up his failure to deliver. The party that rose with tall promises made during the election campaign is failing to live up to its pledges. It has courted controversy in multiple cases, including the cooperative scam.“The party has a free hand in the government,” Krishna Pokharel, a professor of political science, told the Post. “I see no reason for the party to blame its coalition partners.”After the Ilam-2 by-election on April 27, RSP General Secretary Mukul Dhakal travelled to various places to study the reasons for the party’s defeat in the bypolls.During the general secretary's visit to various districts, well-wishers shared their advice that it would have been better had the party focused on organisation-building rather than joining the government, deputy general secretary Burlakoti said.“However, the party is not considering a radical move immediately,” Burlakoti added. “The advice given to our general secretary during his nationwide tour was received as feedback. The party is in no mood to quit the government.”Experts, however, say RSP leaders might be anxious about the report and recommendations of the parliamentary probe committee formed to investigate the cooperative scam. Lamichhane has been accused of embezzling millions of rupees from various cooperatives when he managed the now shuttered television Galaxy 4K.The parliamentary committee has been mandated to figure out if the cooperative money was rerouted to the Gorkha Media Network. Lamichhane was the managing director of the media company that operated the television.“Anticipating the possible outcome of the probe, the RSP could have started to bargain with ruling partners,” Jhalak Subedi, a political analyst, told the Post. “They might have tried to use the situation to win public sentiment.”But Burlakoti denied such a possibility. “We are confident that our party president won’t be implicated by the probe,’’ he said. “Then there is no question our party leaders should be bargaining with the coalition partners.” \n“Our land. Our future”. The theme for this year’s World Environment Day, emphasising land restoration, combating desertification and building resilience to drought, encompasses the pressing issues of this era which need careful intervention. The scale and intensity of the impacts of land degradation, desertification and drought are alarming. The United Nations Environment Program (UNEP) states that up to 40 percent of the world’s land is degraded, adversely impacting around 3.2 billion people. Projections also indicate that over three-quarters of the world's population by 2050 will be affected by drought. These impacts manifest in several aspects of life and nature, including loss of biodiversity and ecosystems, depletion of resources, food insecurity, livelihood and ultimate human existence. In recent times, land degradation induced by physical, chemical and biological processes has been accelerated by human activities. The main culprits include haphazard infrastructure development, industrialisation, high carbon-intensive energy use, overgrazing and excessive extraction of natural resources without consideration of environmental sustainability. Prolonged droughts are becoming more common and climate change adds uncertainty and complexities to their occurrences. Nepal’s vulnerabilityNepal’s young mountains are geologically fragile and complex. Located in a tectonically active zone, the whole land mass from the Himalayas in the North to the Siwalik in the South is susceptible to peculiar challenges, especially erosion, landslides and floods. Anthropogenic activities in this hazard-prone region, including haphazard infrastructure construction, land use change, and chemical fertiliser and pesticide overuse, exacerbate these natural phenomena. For instance, road construction on the slopes without due consideration to the environment and slope stabilisation in the last decade has increased incidents of landslides and slope failures. Excessive extraction of resources from rivers is another concern. While regulatory provisions in the Environment Protection Act and Regulation mandate comprehensive assessment, project developers often perceive such provisions as a burden. Limited focus on the implementation of the Environmental Management Plan, compliance monitoring and evaluation, and audits are the reasons behind haphazard resource extraction and the continuation of environmentally unsustainable projects.Soil loss through erosion, a serious threat to soil health, results in agricultural yield decline, ecosystem degradation, habitat destruction and several economic impacts. A 2016 study by the International Center for Integrated Mountain Development (ICIMOD) estimated 40 million tons of soil loss between 1990 and 2010 in the Koshi basin. Identification of arable soil loss areas is critical for effective land management planning focused on conservation measures. The 61st report of the Office of the Auditor General pointed out that the content of soil organic matter currently stands at 2.83 against the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) target of 3.37. Policy interventionsA 2018 report titled “Land degradation neutrality target setting program in Nepal” set three targets to be achieved by 2030: i) Increase forest cover to 44.7 percent; ii) increase agricultural growth by 6 percent; iii) increase Soil Organic Carbon in forest and cropland by 1 percent per annum and iv) restoring 10 percent of wetland ecosystem out of 26277 sq. hectares of wetlands. Among these, Nepal’s success in increasing forest cover from 39.6 percent in 1993 to 44.74 percent in 2018 is praised all over the world as one of the best-case examples of sustainable forest management initiatives. Despite this achievement, the recent episodes of forest fires during the pre-monsoon period are worrisome. The attainment of other targets requires concentrated effort by building synergies and collaboration among national policies/strategies and different climate action programmes. For instance, Land Use Policy, Agriculture Development Strategy, Nepal Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan and Climate Change Policy are required to be aligned on its objectives, strategies and programmes. At the programme level, for instance, the National Climate Change Support Programme, the National Adaptation Plan, and the President Chure Terai Madesh Conservation Programme need to focus on a collaborative approach; eliminating duplication and creating synergies among beneficiaries and outcome of this programme. Research on drought shows an increasing trend in both the intensity and frequency of drought occurrences. The impacts of drought are significantly higher in rain-fed agricultural regions like Nepal, which rely extensively on the monsoon. Droughts result in crop failures and food insecurity, which is why region-specific explorations of droughts are essential for effective drought monitoring and risk mitigation. A 2021 study indicated that summer drought events have increased fivefold in the central region, doubled in the eastern region, and not significantly changed in the western region of Nepal. These incidences have severe implications for vulnerable communities that are mostly dependent on subsentence agriculture for their livelihood. As a result, difficulty in local livelihoods prevails, which acts as a “push factor” leading to increased migration from rural to urban city centres and abroad. Soil healthHealthy soil is the foundation not only of agricultural systems and food security but also of the existence of humans. So, data management should be a priority towards understanding and analysing the pattern, trend and hotspots of land degradation and droughts. Sustainable land management programmes should incorporate soil conservation and watershed management, soil fertility management and improvement, community forestry programmes, technology development, and research and development. Climate-smart agriculture and the implementation and monitoring of environmental management plans are equally important. For these programmes to be successful, functional coordination mechanisms and institutional arrangements are pivotal. Further, opportunities to tap climate finance for implementing adaptation programmes at the local level will be crucial. But the state alone cannot address the land degradation problem; rather, collaboration among all sectors and stakeholders, including civil society, the private sector, and the general public, is essential for achieving the desired outcomes in restoring land, combating desertification and building drought resilience. \nEven in 2024, women stand a long way from accessing equal opportunities with men. The persistent gender disparities across various spheres of life—education, employment, healthcare, and beyond—are stark reminders of the structural barriers confronting women in Pakistan. Despite efforts, the nation consistently lags on gender parity indices, raising concerns about the adequacy and sufficiency of initiatives targeted at closing the gender gap. Placed 142nd out of 146 countries on the WEF’s 2023 Global Gender Gap Index, it is evident that significant strides are needed to address gender inequities in Pakistan.An examination of past budgetary allocations and policy documents unveils a persistent neglect of gender considerations, manifesting in inadequate resource allocation for women across crucial sectors. These systemic imbalances perpetuate gender inequalities, thwarting the full realisation of Pakistan’s human potential. Recent stabilisation policies have further tilted the scales against women due to discriminate access to formal capital markets, decent jobs, financial and digital tools, etc.As the new fiscal year approaches, it is imperative to remind the government of the gender issues that have only received perfunctory attention over the years. Policymakers must acknowledge that no economic recovery can be sustainable if half the country’s population is inhibited in its capacity to contribute productively, underscoring the need for gender-centric policies.While economic revival must remain a top priority, any effort towards this goal without adequate female representation is like building a house of cards. Sustainable economic recovery is contingent upon the mainstreaming of gender-centric policies across all sectors. This necessitates integrating the gendered impacts of policies into the planning process, rather than treating them as an afterthought.In this context, the federal and provincial budgets can be leveraged by respective governments to address disparities through gender-responsive budgeting. Gender Responsive Budget entails evaluating the gendered impacts of budgetary allocations, integrating gender equality in planning processes, and establishing monitoring mechanisms for greater accountability. The overarching goal is to ensure equitable distribution of resources for inclusive development.It is disconcerting that despite the widespread adoption of Gender Responsive Budget in many countries, including South Asian counterparts India and Bangladesh, Pakistan has yet to present a gender-responsive budget. As a first step, all PC-1 forms must incorporate a dedicated section obligating departments to thoroughly assess the gendered impacts of the proposed projects. Projects that help level the playing field should be prioritised over those that magnify distortions. Additionally, macroeconomic policies must only be implemented after carefully assessing their differential impacts on women.To further promote gender equity, several key demands must be addressed, including ensuring equal employment opportunities, pay equity, supporting women-owned businesses with financial incentives, and increasing funding for girls’ education, especially in underserved areas. Expanding maternal, reproductive, and mental health services, establishing affordable childcare facilities, and streng­thening laws and support services against gender-based violence are also essential, particularly in the face of climatic cha­l­lenges. Ad­­diti­o­­nally, enhancing social protection program­mes for more coverage, along with increasing digital and financial access is essential to promote equity.Greater representation of women in decision-making roles is of utmost import­ance. Currently, political representation seems confined to a few privileged women, often detached from the everyday challenges faced by the majority.This lack of representative female voices in the political arena results in the formation of ineffective policies that overlook critical gender issues. Developing mechanisms to facilitate participatory budgeting can help address this concern.The government must also prioritise data consolidation to support evidence-based policymaking. At present, the inadequate targeting of social programmes stemming from deficiencies in data undermines the effectiveness of initiatives. With limited fiscal space, the government must calibrate each and every budgetary allocation judiciously for maximised impact, for which data is key.In a nutshell, mainstreaming gender considerations across all sectors during the planning phase can enable policy-makers to significantly enhance the prospects for fairer, more inclusive economic resurgence.-Dawn (Pakistan)/ANN \nNepal is in the hands of shortsighted and irrational decision-makers. Take, for example, the recent directive by Home Minister Rabi Lamichhane to deploy traffic rule violators for traffic management. Thankfully, Lamichhane’s directive was overturned by the Supreme Court. The Kathmandu Road Division’s hasty decision to blacktop the road section the Kathmandu Metropolitan City had prepared for footpath extension is another example.It is striking how Lamichhane—a journalist-turned-politician and a former vocal critic of the ministers from parties he now aligns with—turned out no different. He is just as unscrupulous and power-hungry as the old guard, doing everything he can to remain in power and satisfy his political ambitions. Such a hunger for power leads him to make hasty and moody decisions, further augmenting the burden on the economy and society. This piece will analyse the economic cost of such decisions later, but first, let’s understand the reasons behind the pomposity of the leaders. One must understand political schooling to understand why Nepali politicians, new and old, formulate bizarre policies. What are the qualifications to become a politician, let alone a minister, in Nepal? It is anything but education and expertise. The current federal Cabinet of Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal and state and local level governments are not far from any of this. Most of them are no experts, nor do they hold the required knowledge to run their positions. The irony is that we have a government where a journalist becomes the home minister, a former rebel commander becomes the finance minister, and someone who lost the election becomes the minister of foreign affairs, home affairs, and physical infrastructure and transportation, all within a year under the same prime ministership. How can one person seamlessly transition between ministries overnight and suddenly become an expert in each field? ConsequencesThe lack of proper education and thorough understanding of the policymakers’ responsibilities is causing serious problems at the policy level. This is the main reason for their narrow-mindedness—their inability to accept diversity and expert opinions—and to understand complex social and economic phenomena, which leads them to have a “holier-than-thou” and “I am the law” attitude. Huge economic costs and unnecessary social burdens come with that. Every economic policy comes with economic and social costs. Economic costs are of two types: Direct costs and opportunity costs. Direct costs are the actual tangible expenditures associated with implementing a policy and can be easily measured. Opportunity costs are implicit and come with forgone policy alternatives. These are difficult to measure, yet are crucial for policy evaluation, as they directly affect overall output or the economy. For example, had the home minister's recent ruling not been halted by the Supreme Court, it would have cost the nation an estimated Rs250 million a year. This calculation is based on the daily productivity of an individual ($1434/365) at the current exchange rate (Rs133.25/USD) and 1,300 incidences per day. The recent impulsive decision by the Road Department, under Raghuvir Mahaseth, to blacktop a section of the New Road, led to financial costs. If the minister were concerned about the people and the economy, he would have worked to speed up the construction of the remaining section of the Ring Road, which has far more important economic, social, and health and environmental concerns. As a result of these difficulties, households are bearing extra social costs, and the retail and service economies are losing productivity in the area due to a lack of proper infrastructure and environmental quality. Further, this will only increase the cost of production over time and reduce the country’s output because of fewer economic activities. Similarly, the former finance minister Janardan Sharma’s controversial tax policy and the current finance minister Barsha Man Pun's ineffective policy of distributing the budget for their cadres through popular programmes such as the Prime Minister Daughter Resilient Programme—when similar programmes like former PM KP Oli’s Prime Minister Employment Programme turned into white elephants—will add further burden. The inconsistency in the government’s policies, such as reducing tax last year and increasing this year on electric vehicles, shows a lack of understanding of the matter. These are just a few examples of irrational and farfetched laws and policies of the past and incumbent governments. The politicians’ behaviours and self-righteous actions put a huge economic, social and environmental toll on the nation. Additionally, policies that lead to the depletion of natural resources and allocation of public property to private politicians’ cronies result from the irresponsibility of the leaders. Not to forget, the decisions of the former government led by KP Oli to allow the commercialisation and export of natural resources from the Chure region and swap the land of the Jhapa-based Giri Bandhu Tea Estate are no less concerning. There should be stringent mechanisms to control politicians’ reckless decisions. Though the Supreme Court has been overturning such steps, self-fulfilling politicians like those in the current and past governments remain a nuisance. Politicians must be made responsible for their deeds, even if they do not trigger corruption cases. Publicising cost-benefit analysis before formulating any such policies and regulations should be made mandatory. Otherwise, no matter whether the old or the new leaders make it to the government with their chicaneries, Nepal will continue to bear economic, social and environmental costs.  \nIn what looks like a perfect example of a circle of financial gain and loss, Nepal is sending a significant amount of money, much of which is earned through remittance, to foreign destinations every year to pay for the higher education of Nepalis. In the first nine months of the fiscal year 2023-24, which began in mid-July, the country sent out 95.85 billion rupees in foreign education alone. The figure could be even higher, as students and their guardians often find non-conventional or illegal mediums, including hundi, to transfer money abroad. What is alarming is that the official figures represent a 42.5 percent increase from the same duration in the last fiscal year, when students took Rs67.19 billion to spend on education abroad. In FY 2022-23, the total outgoing amount stood at Rs142 billion, a 48 percent rise from the Rs67.70 billion in FY 2021-22.Along with cash, the number of Nepali youths leaving home for education abroad is growing each year. In the first eight months of the current fiscal year, over 90,000 students have obtained the no-objection certificate (NOC) from the Ministry of Education. The total figure for FY 2022-23 stood at over 110,000, while it was almost 113,000 in FY 2021-22. As per the Ministry of Education, the number of students obtaining NOC has tripled in the past decade. That these students start earning after a few years and send money is a positive fact not to be missed—Nepal’s remittance is growing every year, thanks to the students-turned-non-resident Nepalis and labour migrants. But what we gain from remittance, we end up losing in the form of human capital. At a median age of 27.1, we are still a relatively younger country, which makes us a lucrative source for the export of youths.Our youths are heading out of the country in hundreds of thousands each year, and the risk is that they might return to the country only when we have missed the train of development. It is no surprise that 33 percent of the NOCs are obtained for study in Japan, a country of old people with a median age of almost 50 years. Ageing or aged developed countries like Japan, the United States and Canada, among many others, need a constant supply of youth migrants willing to toil hard. Poor countries of Asia and Africa have become rich sources for the export of cheap labour that not only sustains the economies of developed countries but also supplies children who transform from immigrants to naturalised citizens and keep those countries in rude demographic health.Meanwhile, those in positions of power in Nepal, including political leaders, bureaucrats and university and school authorities, continue to turn the country into an undesirable place. As education becomes expensive and the job market is saturated, youths see no reason to stay back in Nepal. While education abroad is no guarantee of success, we have collectively failed to assure students of the quality of education we are offering at home. Apart from improving the quality itself, we also need to work on image-building—that Nepal’s education is not as bad as it has been made out to be.    \nWestern powers and countries from the rest of the world will use the second day of a major summit in Switzerland on Sunday to pursue a consensus on condemning Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and underscoring concerns about the war's human cost.A draft of the final summit declaration seen by Reuters refers to Russia's invasion as a “war”- a label Moscow rejects - and calls for Ukraine’s control over the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant and its Azov Sea ports to be restored.Moscow casts what it calls its special military operation in Ukraine as part of a broader struggle with the West, which it says wants to bring Russia to its knees. Kyiv and the West say Russia is waging an illegal war of conquest.World leaders including US Vice President Kamala Harris, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and French President Emmanuel Macron gathered this weekend at a mountaintop resort in a bid to bolster international support for ending the war.Many Western leaders voiced forceful condemnation of the invasion, invoking the UN Charter in defense of Ukrainian territorial integrity, and rejecting Russian President Vladimir Putin's demands for parts of Ukraine as a condition for peace.“One thing is clear in this conflict: there is an aggressor, which is Putin, and there is a victim, which is the Ukrainian people,” Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said.Some leaders are expected to depart early, and talks on Sunday will turn towards pursuing a joint position on the need for nuclear and food security, and the return of prisoners of war and children removed from Ukraine during the conflict.White House National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan told reporters Qatar had helped to mediate the return from Russia of 30 or more Ukrainian children to their families.“It’s going to take international pressure. It’s going to take a spotlight from the international community – and not just from the voices from the United States or Europe – but from unusual voices, as well, to say what Russia has done here is morally reprehensible and must be reversed,” he said.Kyiv says about 20,000 children have been taken to Russia or Russian-occupied territory without the consent of family or guardians since the war began. Moscow rejects this, saying it has protected vulnerable children from the war zone.The draft communique, dated June 13, calls for all illegally deported children to be returned.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy hailed the participation of more than 90 countries at the Buergenstock resort overlooking Lake Lucerne as a show of international support for Kyiv, even as some European allies said a broader outreach was needed to build a lasting peace plan.One central ambition of the Swiss and Ukrainian organisers is to announce on Sunday the host country for a follow-up conference meant to build on the Swiss momentum.Saudi Arabia is one of the favourites, and Foreign Minister Prince Faisal bin Farhan Al Saud said the kingdom was ready to assist the peace process, but warned that a viable settlement would hinge on “difficult compromise.”Striking a balance in the summit’s final declaration between forthright condemnation of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and wording that commands the broadest possible support has been part of the diplomatic tug-of-war at the event, sources say.It remains to be seen how many countries will back a final joint declaration, and Austrian Chancellor Karl Nehammer on Saturday sought to temper hopes somewhat.“Just to manage expectations, please: the crucial take-away is that we’ve all come here, that we’re talking, that many different nations and continents are talking to each other ... This is the essence of this conference,” he said. “Peace and peace processes take time, working millimetre by millimetre.” \nAs many as 10 people, including children, were shot and wounded at a city-run water park near Detroit on Saturday evening, police said, calling the incident random gunfire.The suspect was still at large late on Saturday, but police said they believed he was cornered in a house nearby. The gun was found at the scene, police said.A man got out of a vehicle in front of Brooklands Plaza Splash Pad park, in Rochester Hills, Michigan, about 5 p.m. (2100 GMT) and fired about 30 shots from a 9mm semiautomatic Glock, reloading several times, Oakland County Sheriff Michael Bouchard told a press conference.It was not immediately clear if there were any fatalities, said police, who had initially reported five people shot.Rochester Hills is about 30 miles (50 km) north of Detroit. The neighbouring community Oxford Township, also in Oakland County, was the scene of a 2021 mass school shooting where student Ethan Crumbley, then 15, killed four students and wounded six other students and a teacher at Oxford High School.“It’s a gut punch, obviously, for us here in Oakland County,” Bouchard said. “We’ve gone through so many tragedies, you know. We’re not even fully comprehending what happened at Oxford.”Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer said on X, “I am heartbroken to learn about the shooting in Rochester Hills.” \nThe weather is forecast to be partly to generally cloudy throughout the country on Sunday.Light to moderate rain with thunder and lightning is likely to occur in some places of Gandaki, Koshi and Bagmati provinces the Meteorological Forecasting Division said. In Madhesh and the rest of the country, similar conditions may occur in one or two places.Tonight, partly to generally cloudy weather is expected at Koshi, Madhesh, Bagmati and Gandaki provinces with chances of light to moderate rain with thunder and lightning in Madhesh, Koshi and high hilly regions of Bagmati and Gandaki provinces. Dhangadi experienced the hottest day in the country with temperatures rising to 42.7 degrees Celsius while Jomsom recorded a minimum temperature of 12.0 degrees Celsius. Meanwhile, Kathmandu’s temperature rose to a maximum of 35.3 degrees Celsius on Saturday.  \nAs John Berger, a prominent art critic and novelist, said, art is the enduring legacy of a generation, preserving the thoughts, beliefs, politics, and passions of an entire era. When all is perished, what remains is art, a reflection of an era’s collective consciousness, preserved for posterity. Art is both the most accessible and spiritual form of an archive, distinct from academic records. It is because, unlike other forms of archives, art captures both the profound and the mundane, even when they lie in striking juxtaposition. It embodies emotions and experiences too complex for words, nurturing the drive in artists of different eras to innovate beyond conventional forms of expression and mediums.The most recent art exhibition at Gallery Mcube’s ‘Young Artists Show’ features ten young artists’ expressions of love, angst, and struggle for the world around them all within one space. This exhibition features stunning, inventive, and evocative artworks that explore a wide range of subjects and emotions. The artworks represent a diverse group of young artists from various parts of Nepal.Harshita Singh’s artwork is the first thing you see as you enter the space. It incorporates her pottery practice and her fascination with the concept of ‘Hamsa’, which represents hands. Her creation is both original and compelling. I found myself staring at artwork for extended periods, trying to unravel its meanings and the artistic processes behind it.Subodh Bhandari and Sambrididhi R Shakya’s ‘What Makes a City’ deserve a larger and extended exhibition because of the issues it raises. This intricate mixed-media features layers of symbolism that will engage art enthusiasts and amateurs alike. With a specific focus on Kathmandu, these works explore the essence of urban life and the difficulties faced by cities, employing materials like plastic sacks, glass, intricate paintwork, and calligraphy.These artworks address Kathmandu’s waste management issues and water scarcity with sensitivity and insight. They also shed light on Nepal’s brain drain problem, highlighting its impact on the city and its inhabitants. Overall, ‘What Makes a City’ by Subodh Bhandari and Sambrididhi R Shakya not only showcases their artistic prowess but also raises important social and environmental issues in a visually compelling and thought-provoking way.As I walked through the exhibition, I came across feathers painted with detailed, lifelike images of different birds hovering around a levitating tree branch in an enthralling spectacle. More feathers scattered all over the floor, each one intricately painted with bird art. I found the concept to be both captivating and innovative, pushing the boundaries of artistic expression with daring experimentation. This artwork is part of Ronisha Shrestha’s series ‘Abandoned Companions’, in which she compassionately portrays the fate of animals in urban landscapes with incredible empathy.Saran Tandukar’s ‘Scarecrow’ stands out from the rest of the artworks presented in the space. He has collected clothes and fabrics from his community to capture stories, memories, and their essence.His work reflects the migration struggles in our community. He says, “When there is a drought, everybody leaves their home and field, even if they are emotionally connected. The situation forces them to leave everything behind.”He expresses feeling like an abandoned scarecrow in a drought-stricken field, watching his friends and family depart. Just as no one takes a scarecrow when they migrate, he feels as if he is left behind—a sentiment shared by many families and communities in Nepal.The artist’s expertise in working with cloth, particularly in capturing human features, adds an intriguing layer to the piece. His skill in painting with cloth, especially in depicting people's faces and structures, adds a fascinating dimension to the pieces.As part of this series, the exhibition features cubes adorned with levitated fabrics—a sight that further enhances the thematic exploration and visual impact of the artworks on display.The two artworks presented by Rojan Rai, ‘Sweet Smile’ and ‘Bags Full of Uncertainties’, intertwine graffiti-style street art and integrate traditional forms of painting. They feature the essence of daily life through the depiction of the resilience of street vendors.‘Bags Full of Uncertainties’ depicts a middle-aged street vendor overwhelmed by the number of bags he carries. This painting highlights the burdens of uncertainty while also showcasing the beauty of resilience. It is a poignant and powerful reminder to embrace life’s unpredictability and cherish each moment.The second artwork by Rojan also shows a street vendor, but this one is a child. ‘Sweet Smile’ depicts a little boy selling cotton candy against a backdrop bearing the word ‘SWEET’ in bold graffiti style. The boy’s joyous grin, contrasted against this vivid background, exemplifies the beauty and resilience of ordinary life.Gallery Mcube’s ‘Young Artists Show’ not only exhibits budding artists’ enormous potential but also expresses the new generation's emotions and sociopolitical challenges. It showcases their artistic ability and also addresses important social and environmental issues in visually appealing and innovative ways. The gallery’s initiative to spotlight these talented artists is truly commendable. Young Artists’ Show 2024Where: Gallery Mcube, Chakupat, LalitpurTimings: 11:00 am to 8:00 pmEntry: FreeTill June 19 \nWorld leaders gathered at a Swiss mountain resort on Saturday to try to build support for Ukraine's peace proposals at a summit skipped by US President Joe Biden, shunned by China and dismissed as a waste of time by Moscow.More than 90 countries will take part, but China's absence in particular has dimmed hopes the summit would show Russia as globally isolated, while recent military reverses have put Kyiv on the back foot. The war in Gaza between Israel and Hamas has also diverted the world's attention from Ukraine.The talks will focus on broader concerns triggered by the war, such as food and nuclear security.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has trumpeted the summit's wide attendance as a success and predicted \"history being made\", adding that agreements stemming from it will be part of the peacemaking process.\"Ukraine never wanted this war. It's a criminal and absolutely unprovoked aggression by Russia,\" he said alongside Swiss President Viola Amherd, who said the conflict had brought \"unimaginable suffering\" and violated international law.German Chancellor Olaf Scholz called the gathering an important step to discuss peace and security questions.\"This is a small plant that needs to be watered, but of course also with the perspective that more can then come out of it,\" he told Welt TV.Biden sent US Vice President Kamala Harris to represent him—riling Kyiv—while Saudi Arabian Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman will be represented by his foreign minister and India dispatched a lower-level delegation. Beijing is staying away after Russia was frozen out of proceedings.Harris announced more than $1.5 billion in energy and humanitarian aid for Ukraine, where infrastructure has been pounded by Russian airstrikes since the 2022 invasion.\"This war remains an utter failure for [Russian President Vladimir] Putin,\" Harris said during a meeting with Zelenskiy.A military helicopter hovered over the luxury Buergenstock resort overlooking Lake Lucerne on Saturday as leaders arrived by helicopter on a patch of grassland fenced off with razor wire while cows grazed nearby.On the eve of the summit, Putin said Russia would end the war only if Kyiv agreed to drop its NATO ambitions and hand over four provinces claimed by Moscow—demands Kyiv swiftly rejected as tantamount to surrender.Putin's conditions apparently reflected Moscow's growing confidence that its forces have the upper hand in the war. Scholz cast them as an attempt to muddy the waters.\"Everyone knows that this is not a serious proposal, but had something to do with the peace conference in Switzerland,\" he said in a separate TV interview.Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said Putin's proposal had \"shown the real path to peace\".\"If you want to save the world, discuss Vladimir Putin's proposal ... Only those who do not want peace can't see, can't understand it,\" TASS news agency quoted her as saying.China and RussiaZelenskiy has accused Beijing of helping Moscow undermine the gathering, an accusation China's Foreign Ministry denied.The leaders of France, Germany, Italy, Britain, Canada and Japan are among those due to attend. Turkey and Hungary, which maintain friendlier ties with Russia, are also expected to join.Austrian Chancellor Karl Nehammer said it was an opportunity to start building a broader global consensus to put pressure on Russia.\"It's like we're in a Western echo chamber. That is: all Western European countries, the USA, we agree on what we want to happen with Ukraine,\" Nehammer said. \"But that alone is not enough.\"Neutral Switzerland, which took on the summit at Zelenskiy's behest, wants to pave the way for a future peace process that includes Russia. Saudi Arabia or Turkey have been mooted as possible hosts.Calls for Russia to be at the table will only get stronger over time, said Bob Deen, senior research fellow at the Netherlands-based Clingendael Institute think-tank.\"There is a risk that if Ukraine waits too long, it might end up with rival formats popping up. It may risk losing the initiative,\" Dean told a forum on the summit's sidelines.Supporters of Ukraine are marking the talks with a series of events in the nearby city of Lucerne to draw attention to the war's humanitarian costs.On Saturday afternoon, about 250 people gathered in the centre of the city, many wrapped in Ukrainian flags, wearing traditional clothes and carrying pictures of missing brothers, husbands or sons as they shared their stories.\"I'm clinging to the idea that my husband is still alive,\" said Svitlana Bilous, the wife of a soldier who has been missing for more than 14 months. \"That's what keeps me going.\" \nThe Millennium Challenge Account Nepal (MCA-Nepal) has signed a contract with Techno Electric and Engineering Company Ltd India to construct a 400 kV substation at Ratmate in Belkotgadhi Municipality-7 of Nuwakot district as part of implementing Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) Nepal Compact.“The 400 kV Gas Insulated Switchgear (GIS) substation will be constructed within the contract duration of 39 months,” the MCA-Nepal said in a statement on Saturday. “Once completed, Ratmate Substation will have a capacity of 1000 Mega Volt Ampere making it one of the largest substations in the country.”The new $51.6 million Ratmate Substation will serve as a critical interconnection of power transmission between the Lapsiphedi and New Hetauda Substations, said the MCA-Nepal, the body responsible for implementing the MCC projects in the country.Khadga Bahadur Bisht, executive director at the MCA-Nepal, and Rajiv Agarwal, director- commercial at Techno Electric and Engineering Company Ltd India, signed and exchanged the contract in the presence of MCC and MCA-Nepal officials.With the execution of this contract, MCA-Nepal has signed two of the three substations construction contracts planned under the MCC Nepal Compact.Nepal Electricity Authority Managing Director Kul Man Ghising has described the signing of the deal as an important progress in implementing the MCC Compact.“The 400 kV Ratmate Substation, as envisioned in the Transmission System Development Plan of Nepal (TSDPN), is a critical component of Nepal’s national power transmission system and yet another milestone in MCC Nepal Compact’s contribution to the energy sector in Nepal,” he said.Diane L Francisco, resident country director of Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC), said the signing of the Ratmate Substation, the second of the three substations, marks a significant stride forward as the MCC Nepal Compact builds momentum in its implementation.“Over the next few years, we are confident that the progress of the MCC Nepal Compact will provide critical contributions to Nepal’s growing energy sector, helping meet Nepal’s evolving needs, bolstering Nepal’s immense potential, and bringing prosperity to the Nepali people,” Francisco said. Last month, the MCA-Nepal had signed a contract with another Indian company for the construction of a substation in Nawalparasi. Linxon India Pvt Ltd bagged the contract for the construction of the 400kV New Butwal Substation in Nawalparasi.MCA-Nepal Executive Director Bisht shared that the MCA-Nepal is expediting all works for the construction of the substations and transmission lines under the Electricity Transmission Project funded by the US government’s Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) and the government of Nepal.“The contract for the third substation in Damauli is in the pipeline and the bids for the 18-km cross-border line are under evaluation,” he said. “We are also at the final stages of the procurement process to invite bids for the construction of the remaining portion of the transmission line as well.”The 400 kV Ratmate Substation will also have evacuation capacity of around 3,200 MW of power from hydropower projects and substations. The reliable power at various voltage levels at the substation will be available for distribution in Nepal to enhance industrial and commercial activities, the MCA-Nepal said.Along with three substations, the MCC Nepal Compact will fund the construction of up to 315 km of transmission line from Lapsiphedi, Kathmandu to the Nepal-India border in Nawalparasi (Bardaghat Susta West) under the Electricity Transmission Project.The bids for the 18 km cross-border transmission line have been received for evaluation and that it aims to award the contract in August, said the MCA-Nepal. “Likewise, preparations are on track to ensure the bids for the remaining 297 km of transmission lines are relaunched at the earliest possible this year,” it said. \nThe caretaker Prime Minister of India, Narendra Modi, is all set to take the oath of office for the third constitutive term on Sunday evening, with the invited South Asian leaders to witness the ceremony. Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal will fly to New Delhi to attend the swearing-in, and the two prime ministers will hold a meeting after the ceremony, according to government officials. A Cabinet meeting on Thursday approved the prime minister’s visit to India. It will be a two-day trip, says Rekha Sharma, Minister for Communication and Information Technology. On Wednesday, Modi phoned Prime Minister Dahal and they briefly discussed the upcoming meeting, according to government officials.Modi is set to become the second Indian prime minister after Jawaharlal Nehru to serve three constitutive terms. The third term will be different from his first two as he was the prime minister backed by an absolute majority for his party, the Bharatiya Janata Party, in the last two terms. This time, Modi has to rely on coalition partners under the banner of the National Democratic Alliance.With Modi entering his third term, will Nepal-India ties change, or will they remain the same? Modi has championed the “Neighborhood First” policy in his dealings with South Asian nations. Modi is the only Indian prime minister who has visited Nepal more than once—in 2014 and 2018, and again in 2022. Thus, he knows all top leaders of Nepal and is fully aware of bilateral issues, having served in the office for a decade.“India’s policy towards Nepal will not change. There is very much consistency in their policy towards Nepal,” said former foreign minister Ramesh Nath Pandey. “Modi will have control over Nepal policy.In the past decade, several Nepali prime ministers have visited India and interacted with Modi. The Indian prime minister is thus fully aware of Nepal’s concerns and interests, as well as India's expectations of Nepal. However, according to Pandey, Nepal has squandered a decade trying to shed the historical baggage and resolve bilateral differences.This time, the BJP’s coalition partner, the Janata Dal (United), hails from the bordering state of Bihar. The JDU has called for a review of India’s controversial Agnipath scheme, under which hundreds of Nepali youths used to be recruited into the Indian Army’s Gorkha regiments. The Nepal government has refused to allow India to recruit its youth under this short-term scheme, arguing that the 1947 agreement between Nepal, India and Britain stipulated full-term service in both the Indian and British Armies, not short-term enlistment.“Prime Minister Modi had a telephone conversation with the Prime Minister of Nepal,” said an Indian government statement on Thursday. During the talks, Prime Minister Dahal congratulated Prime Minister Modi on his historic victory in the recently concluded Indian general elections, according to the statement.The statement said, “Dahal was convinced that, under Prime Minister Modi's leadership, India-Nepal relations would continue to strengthen.”Nepal shares deep-rooted cultural and civilizational links with India and remains a special partner in India’s ‘Neighbourhood First’ policy, added the statement.Nepal and India have many commonalities and differences that surface from time to time. Issues like boundary disputes, Nepal’s call for scrapping the Peace and Friendship Treaty of 1950 and drafting a new one, and the submission of the report of the Eminent Persons Group on Nepal-India relations, among others, remain key bottlenecks in the bilateral ties. Once again, Modi has an opportunity to resolve them.Some Indian experts also claimed that although Modi’s new government will include several coalition partners, the policy towards Nepal will fundamentally remain unchanged. But Modi’s new term is full of challenges as he will have to rely on and persuade his alliance partners and this could lead to instability in governance.Ranjit Rae, former Indian ambassador to Nepal, said that India’s foreign policy will remain unchanged in Modi’s third term as there is broad consensus among the parties on key foreign policy issues. “As Nitish Kumar is in the government and Bihar shares a long border with Nepal, Nepal will remain important in the foreign policy architecture,” Rae said. “Primarily, India’s ‘Neighbourhood First’ policy will continue.” On reviewing the Agnipath scheme, Rae said that it would be good if the new government reviewed it. According to the Indian media, there are hard bargains among coalition partners in New Delhi on power-sharing and it remains to be decided which party gets what portfolio.The two key alliance partners, N Chandrababu Naidu of the Telugu Desam Party and Nitish Kumar, both have secular credentials, so a party-centric foreign policy is unlikely to dominate during Modi’s third term, said Nihar Nayak, Research Fellow at the New Delhi-based Manohar Parrikar Institute for Defence Studies and Analyses (MP-IDSA).According to Nayak, the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) could see a revival, and as per the strong demands of Nitish Kumar’s JDU, the Agnipath scheme will also be scrapped.“If the Agnipath scheme is scrapped or reviewed, relations with Nepal will improve. The second thing is that there will be no BJP foreign policy. India’s insecurity in the region will diminish. The call for the restoration of the Hindu state in Nepal is unlikely to crop up as prominently. There will be changes in some aspects of foreign policy as Modi will be compelled to heed his coalition partners,” said Nayak. \nThe Oli government's decision to allow land swaps for the Giri Bandhu Tea Estate was overturned by the Supreme Court, leading to accusations of \"policy corruption\" and a demand for an investigation by the Nepali Congress and others.\nThe collective indignity bestowed on political women, from Shailaja Acharya to Sumana Shrestha, by political patriarchs needs immediate redress. In today’s time, when power has ceased to be a zero-sum game and good leadership is synonymous with collaboration, the traditionally inclined old men clumsily spewing patriarchal narratives make civilised citizens extremely uncomfortable. Political women with independent political personhood have always been problematic to traditional men. Sahana’s grit, Shailaja’s impatience, Binda’s blatant feminism and Sumana’s formidability seem to have threatened those with the traditional bent of mind. At least two generations of strong, opinionated women have been sidelined or ousted because they did not fit into the mould of patriarchal party politics. It almost seems like the traditional men view them as political “shrews” who, like in the famous Shakespearean play The Taming of the Shrew, need to be “tamed”, cut to a size that is desirable to political patriarchy.Until not long ago, the concept of a “good woman” stemmed from feminine subservience and obedience. Women’s personhood was stunted through intense psychological conditioning that can be traced back to the origins of the state and society. A woman was told how her family’s honour rested on her good character. She was introduced to a heavy burden of feminine morality at an early age. With stories being fed about good women versus bad, patriarchy was very successful in grooming girls to grow up to be good women and obedient keepers of their family’s honour. Subservience was the prerequisite to being a good woman. A good woman was anything but defiant, and if by chance she did get tempted to disobey and defy the norms, she paid a hefty price. This “truth” was continuously fed into the feminine psyche, mostly through religious texts and scriptures. These women were duly punished in the ancient scriptures and medieval texts crafted and propagated by men.Vyaas wrote the story of how Draupadi was dragged by her hair and abused publicly because she had made fun of Duryodhana, leading to the great war between the Pandava and Kaurava brothers. Mother Mary was glorified as a virgin, while Mary Magdalene was vilified as a “loose” woman and had to be rescued. Sita’s disobedience tempted Ravana and caused much grief to Lord Ram. Eve disobeyed the Lord and ate the apple only to be the cause of Adam’s banishment. Khadija was a strong woman and a successful merchant before she married the Prophet, but she submitted herself to him and became his first disciple. In addition, the annual celebration of Swasthani Vrata Katha revered the ideal woman in the form of Goma Brahmani, who never protested, tolerated every injustice inflicted against her personhood. The idea of feminine morality has been strongly correlated with women’s socio-cultural subservience, religious conformity, psychological and economic fragility and physical docility. Even in politics, the men in charge prefer women who embody traditional femininity. However, here lies the problem: The idea of moral, subservient women clashes with the essence of equality and freedom propounded by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Women who have learned the freedoms cannot unlearn them. Today, several women in politics are highly qualified, independent, articulate and honest. They live the most painful existence because the unlearning of patriarchal values has already taken place within them, and they have a fully developed sense of personhood, which, however, is repeatedly obliterated by their party men or other political men who still operate by the patriarchal rules. Strong, independent, ethical women are repeatedly denied space in the party’s leadership. Educated, dignified, honest, resolute, independent and opinionated, Shailja Acharya was often ridiculed for her “short temper” and “moods”. In UML’s case, Sahana’s leadership in the inter-party women’s caucus irked her party men. An economist by training, she was more qualified than most men in her party, but her commitment to the larger political sorority was perceived as defiance; therefore, a covert “cutting to size” was practised against her as well. Narratives are created to invalidate women as viable leaders. These days, the “tamings” have become more overt. Binda Pandey, one of the handful of qualified women inside UML, was denied an election ticket, and the insider quickly pointed out that her “attitude” killed her prospects. The same has been the case with Shiva Maya Tumbahamphe, Kamala Panta, Shashi Shrestha, and others. Women’s recruitment, retention and promotions in parties seek obedient, subservient “yes-women” who do not have to be “tamed”. The latest “taming” attempt, however, appears much more menacing than the past. A woman with an ivy-league education, who speaks the global language, wears gender-neutral clothing, questions the old guards about procedural gaps, carries her own bags, drives her own car and has managed to keep herself out of the clout-centric politics so far, must irk the political retainers quite intensely to receive such blatant, overt attacks regarding her personal choices: From her clothing to her life partner. KP Oli has tried dismantling Sumana Shrestha’s political legitimacy and citizenship by calling Nepal her maita. The chauvinism that drips from Oli’s statement is disgustingly archaic, feudal and regressive for a leader of his stature.Bringing Shrestha into the helm of political give-and-take does not seem to have worked; if it had, Oli would not have had to start “taming” her. If she was unapologetically vocal as a member of the opposition, she seems adamant as a minister to fix the portfolio given to her. Maybe it is her “audacity” to fix the system at the ministry that has somehow miffed the old guard like Oli. His recent rants, aimed to paint her as a frivolous, westernised young woman whose political journey is a mere fluke, scream his intense insecurities. If that is indeed the case, then maybe Sumana Shrestha is doing something right, and we need more “shrew” muckrakers like her.  \nNepal prepares to auction 5G frequency after a three-year halt, despite concerns about investments, market readiness, and economic viability.\nEducation in Every Home’s report titled ‘Diversity, Equity and Inclusion in Nepal’s Textbooks’ highlights the lack of diversity, inclusivity, and inaccuracies in these textbooks.  The findings include egregious mistakes in textbooks like the inclusion of a letter Abraham Lincloln supposedly wrote—dating to a time 17 years after his assassination, to assertions like Brazil has tigers, elephants and rhinos while Germany has tigers and monkeys. The books display a clear bias in favour of Brahmin Chhetri males, while women make up just 18 percent of all people profiled. While 80 percent of all bylines are male, the presence of marginalised communities, especially Dalits, is nearly non-existent.  \nCrucial events unfold, shaping destinies and altering the course of history.\nThe Araniko Project, which is also a popular blog, aims to uncover the past and present of the Nepal-China relations by using primary sources in Mandarin. A fluent Mandarin speaker, Rajbhandari, who has lived in Beijing for six years, has a master’s degree in Chinese politics from Renmin University of China.  In this conversation, she talks about Chinese historiography on Nepal, the nuances of Mandarin-to-English translation, Nepal-China ties and the importance of understanding Chinese language in order to understand the country. \nNeupane was one of the conveners of ‘Project Sambad’, “a collaborative platform hosted by a group of Nepali institutions, designed to promote in-depth conversations that critically examine Nepali society and its policy-making space.” The first edition of the event happened in Kathmandu on March 14 and 15.  In this interview, the two discuss the state of Nepali public debates and ways to foster better discussions on vital issues. \nWhy do we romanticise the dead? Why can’t we be honest about them? Especially moms. They’re the most romanticised of anyone.”One rarely comes across a book titled ‘I’m Glad My Mom Died’. My first thought after stumbling onto this literary piece was what possibly could have been the author’s grudge towards her mother for naming the book with such an abrasive title. And quite fittingly, the title has made its mark by drawing attention from readers worldwide, making the book a New York Times bestseller. American writer, filmmaker, former actress, and singer Jennette McCurdy has created a stir in the literary scene with her debut book, ‘I’m glad my mom died’. The book’s main theme revolves around the complicated relationship between the author and her mother. The book also explores other themes such as abuse, child stardom and exploitation, eating disorders, grief and healing, and finally, resilience and survival. The memoir opens with the celebration of McCurdy’s sixth birthday when her mom presents her with a two-piece outfit surrounded by daisies. McCurdy throws on her best fake smile and exclaims it to be her favourite birthday gift ever. This particular event prods the readers to be cautious about the series of events that will unfold, hinting at the complex and often painful dynamics of her relationship with her mother that are to be revealed throughout the narrative.The general perception regarding abuse tends to focus primarily on physical violence overlooking other forms, such as emotional and psychological abuse. McCurdy, in her memoir, chronicles the continuum of emotional and psychological abuse she had to face throughout her childhood at the hands of her mother. Just like any other helicopter parent, McCurdy’s mother projects her unmet aspiration of becoming an actor to her daughter. She then continues to micromanage every aspect of McCurdy’s life, often pressuring her to achieve the dream that she once harboured. The authoritarian demeanour of the mother leaves McCurdy to develop OCD from a young age which she refers to as the “Holy Ghost”. Due to her age, she isn’t fully aware of how harmful the condition she was diagnosed with can be. Instead, she is thrilled to have conversations with the “Holy Ghost” where she says, “I can talk to the holy ghost whenever I want to, and he can talk to me, guiding me to do what is right, which is whatever he tells me to do. I am so lucky”. As the memoir continues, the readers find that the mother uses McCurdy’s fame to pay their bills, often flaunting her daughter’s success to maintain her unattained lifestyle. McCurdy’s struggle to make her mother understand her aspiration to become a writer instead of an actor is similar to the struggle of the character Farhan in the Bollywood hit ‘3 Idiots’, where, at last, the orthodox father finally lets his son pursue his interest of becoming a photographer. However, in McCurdy’s case, her mother is dismissive of her daughter’s ambition and instead tries to manipulate her daughter by saying, “Writer’s dress is frumpy and fat. I would never want your little actress’s peach butt to turn into a big, giant writer’s watermelon butt.”The emotional quandary of McCurdy’s is further complicated when her mother gets diagnosed with breast cancer. The mother’s manipulative behaviour leads her to make her children watch the video of her cancer diagnosis time and again until her children take it to blame themselves for the cause of their mother’s cancer. Ultimately, McCurdy considers it her job to save her mother from mortal sickness as cancer. She tries every rule in the book to get validation from her mother to the extent that she hides her preferred colour, purple, just because her mother prefers pink.The situation worsens when even after having reached the age of 16, the mother thinks it is a good idea to let her son and daughter shower in the same bathroom.Similarly, she puts McCurdy on a strict diet plan of calorie restriction. She is even made to read every diet-related book even before she gets her menstruation. The memoir is divided into two parts, i.e. before and after. ‘Before’ chronicles McCurdy’s experience with her abusive mother, whereas ‘After’ poignantly describes the harrowing effect of bulimia as a result of her mother’s years of abuse. The book also focuses on the ethical and developmental concerns of exposing a child to the limelight from a young age through McCurdy’s personal experience in the Hollywood industry. It also highlights the damage the entertainment industry can do to a child’s mental and emotional well-being.The book shines in its execution, particularly in addressing the question, “What does grief look like when you don’t share a great relationship with your loved one?” This question ties seamlessly into the title, as McCurdy struggles to recognise and cope with her emotions following her mother’s death. The universal practice of idolising one’s mother makes it difficult for her to acknowledge the abuse she endured during childhood—adding layers to her grief and healing process. Despite being a candid account of McCurdy’s experience with abuse, the nature of the memoir can resonate with Nepali readers. It mirrors the stark reality of Nepali households, where children often bear the burden of their parents’ unfulfilled dreams of securing a stable job. This restricts them from following their desire when it comes to careers. The memoir plays its part in demonstrating that fame is not everything; it is frequently nothing at all. It urges its readers to see the thin line that demarcates the life of an ordinary person and a celebrity. However, underneath the line lies a shared humanity that transcends fame and fortune, reminding us that our intrinsic value is not defined by external measures of success.The memoir should come with a trigger warning because its graphic narration of emotional abuse might make readers uncomfortable. This disrupted the linear flow of my reading experience, making it difficult to progress through the book. However, the author’s touch of sarcasm creates an engaging authorial voice. Destined to become an actor yet a natural when it comes to writing, McCurdy has set the train in motion through her candid yet moving writing. She accurately describes the mental state of her formative years, which skillfully captures the emotions she wishes to convey. The memoir ends on a hopeful note as McCurdy affirms, “Mom didn’t get better. But I will.”I’m Glad My Mom Died Author: Jennette McCurdyYear: 2022Publisher: Simon and Schuster \nThe ruling and opposition parties might appear divided as they relentlessly attack each other on different issues, but when it comes to criticising the decisions of Sumana Shrestha, the minister for education, science, and technology, they have one voice.Shortly after taking charge of the ministry, Shrestha started a process of taking action against the teachers and professors involved in party politics. The ministry has sought information on the teachers and professors affiliated to the parties from the Election Commission and the respective district education units.The initiative was taken as per the Political Parties Act, 2017 which prohibits the teachers, professors and other government employees from engaging in politics. Similarly, the Patan High Court on October 5, 2021 had ruled that school teachers cannot engage in active politics. Responding to a writ petition, the court said those drawing salaries and benefits from the state coffers should not be involved in partisan politics. The major parties have disapproved of Shrestha’s move as a large number of teachers are their cadres. For instance, as many as 263 of the 4,743 representatives to the Nepali Congress general convention held in December 2021 were school teachers and staff. The number is above five percent of the total delegates.The main opposition CPN-UML also had dozens of teachers as representatives in its 10th general congress held in November that year. Hundreds of school teachers are associated with the CPN (Maoist Centre) as well.Leaders from all these parties have criticised the move directly or indirectly. Speaking in the House of Representatives on Tuesday, Maoist Centre Secretary Devendra Paudel said the principals of many best-performing community schools were affiliated to different parties.“It is unnecessary to test teachers’ DNA. Let them work,” he said, implying that there was no need to probe whether the teachers are affiliated to a political party.Another factor antagonising the major parties is Shrestha’s decision to make public the report of the High-Level National Education Commission— more than five years after it was submitted to then-prime minister KP Sharma Oli.On June 7, she made public the report that Oli and his successors had for years kept under wraps. The government was under the pressure of private schools to keep the report a secret as it envisions converting the schools registered as companies into trusts within 10 years. Converting the existing schools into trusts would mean they will be barred from taking profits home. Several cross-party leaders have investments in private schools.Oli was so annoyed by Minister Shrestha’s decision to make the report public that he resorted to making personal remarks about her nationality and marital status without naming her.Now the teachers’ unions of various parties have united against her. The ministry on May 27 endorsed a directive guiding teachers’ transfers. The directive came amid allegations that teachers are being transferred without fulfilling the due procedure. The directive is accused of encroaching on the authority of the School Management Committee and increasing the ministry’s role in transfers. “Your good education is meaningless if you are doing more harm than good to the education sector,” said Shankar Adhikari, chair of the teacher association close to the Maoist Centre, referring to Shrestha’s foreign degree. “She has a shallow understanding of Nepal's education sector.”Leaders of other teacher associations have asked the minister to reverse the directive, warning of the consequences of not doing so. “The directive was issued with the mala fide intent of troubling teachers. This is unacceptable,” said Gyanedra Rawal of the Nepal Teachers’ Union, the Congress teachers’ wing.Some lawmakers and education experts, however, have supported minister Shrestha, saying she is on the right track to improve the country's education sector. Addressing the lower house meeting on Wednesday, independent lawmaker Amresh Kumar Singh said he fully supports the education minister, who is making the necessary intervention. “The education minister is taking the right course. Her works need to be appreciated,” he said.Those who have followed Shrestha’s work also praise her. “She [Shrestha] is eager to bring about vital changes, mainly in school education,” said Usha Jha, a former member of the National Planning Commission.However, many officials at the ministry are unhappy with her work. While she is dedicated to her job, she has a habit of not listening to others, they allege. “The minister thinks she knows everything and is not accommodative. This is the reason her decisions are dragged into controversy,” said a senior official at the ministry. “A minister is a team leader who has to take all the staff along. But that is not the case now.” \nThe Janata Samajbadi Party-Nepal (JSP-Nepal), led by Upendra Yadav, is set for its Unity General Convention, which will commence on Monday in Janakpur, a month after the party suffered a split.The federal chair of the JSP-Nepal, Ashok Rai, along with seven federal lawmakers and 30 central committee members, split the party on May 5 to form the Janata Samajbadi Party.The party split was more visible at the centre, but it is said to have had a lesser impact on Yadav’s faction in the province so far.Party insiders say the dissidents in provincial assemblies and party committees couldn’t get organised to form new committees as the registration of the new party at the election commission was immediately challenged in the Supreme Court. The court asked the commission and other authorities to put the process on hold, and the case is still sub judice. When the court gives a verdict on the issue, the JSP-Nepal's fence-sitters may decide whether to remain with the party or defect to the new outfit.Just a week before the unity general convention, the party suffered another setback as it had to give up the chief minister’s post in Madhesh Province when the erstwhile coalition partners–the CPN-UML and CPN (Maoist Centre)—withdrew their support to the government. During the floor test held on June 5 JSP-Nepal lawmaker Saroj Kumar Yadav, the immediate past chief minister of the province, fell 4 votes short from securing the position. When he garnered 50 votes in support, 53 members voted against him. In the 107-strong assembly, the chief minister has to secure at least 54 votes in support.Upendra Yadav's parties, including the current JSP-Nepal, continuously led the provincial government for almost seven years until Satish Kumar Singh of the Janamat Party dethroned Yadav’s party from the chief ministerial position on June 7.Though the recent party split and the dethroning of the Madhesh Province’s leadership can be blamed on the party leadership, according to analysts, the unity general convention poses little challenge to Yadav. Because of the split, there are no leaders left in the party who’d challenge Yadav, Chandra Kishore, an observer of Madhesh politics, told the Post. “Therefore, the general convention should be a walk in the park for him.” The party that held its statute convention last year adopted a policy of lobbying for a directly elected presidential system in the country. Likewise, the Madhesh-based party set the goal of fighting for a parliament with fully proportional representation. This is expected to direct policy at the unity convention. However, experts question the sustainability of the policies adopted by the statute convention in the party's post-split situation.“The policies adopted by the statute convention will remain intact,” Prakash Adhikari, a federal lawmaker of the party, told the Post. “The party division, which is sub judice in the Supreme Court, will not impact policy changes.”Chandra Kishore, who has been following Madhesh politics for a long time, differs from Adhikari.“Yadav is a political strategist. He acts as per the situation,” he said. “He will not necessarily act as per the party documents.” The JSP-Nepal’s central committee in January, two months before the split, decided to hold the unity general convention in June. The party decided to organise the convention in order to consolidate the unity between various Madhes-based parties over time, party leaders said.This is the first unity convention held after the merger of various Madhes-based parties, Manish Kumar Suman, spokesperson for the JSP-Nepal, told the Post.The Tarai Madhesh Loktantrik Party, led by Mahantha Thakur; the Rastriya Madhesh Samajbadi Party, led by Sarat Singh Bhandari; the Tarai Madhesh Sadbhawana Party, led by Mahendra Yadav’ the Sadbhawana Party, led by Rajendra Mahato; the Madheshi Janadhikar Ganatantrik Party, led by Raj Kishor Yadav; and Anil Jha’s Nepal Sadbhawana Party merged to form the Rastriya Janata Party before the 2017 general and provincial elections.The Rastriya Janata Party and the Nepal Sanghiya Samajbadi Party led by Upendra Yadav fought the 2017 elections with a tie-up in Madhesh but merged the parties in 2020 to form the Janata Samajbadi Party. When the erstwhile prime minister KP Sharma Oli issued an ordinance to split the Yadav-led party to counterbalance a rift within his Nepal Communist Party (NCP) formed after the merger of the CPN-UML and the CPN (Maoist Centre) following the 2017 election, the merger in the two Madhesh-based parties was hastened. Before this, the only Madheshi party to hold the general convention periodically was the Nepal Sadbhawana Party. Gajendra Narayan Singh, who formed the Nepal Sadbhabana Council in 1985, turned the council into a party following the first people’s movement of 1990.Yadav’s will be another Madhesh-based party to hold the general convention more than once, Suman said.Article 269 (4) (B) of the constitution mandates a political party to hold its general convention at least once in five years. However, if the office bearers cannot be elected in five years due to a situation arising out of special circumstances, based on the statute of a political party, new leaders can be elected within six months thereafter. The constitutional time frame is not mandatory for a new party or one formed after a split. As Nepal’s regional parties often suffer splits, they rarely hold the general convention periodically.The Upendra Yadav-led Madheshi Janadhikar Forum (MJF) held its second convention in 2009, in Birgunj, just after the first Constituent Assembly election in 2008. The MJF was a rights-based organisation before it entered politics after the first Madhesh uprising of 2007. JSP-Nepal spokesperson Suman said Yadav has led various political parties, but this is the second time an outfit he leads is holding the general convention.The Bijaya Kumar Gachhadar-led Madhesi Janadhikar Forum (Loktantrik) held its first general convention in Biratnagar in May 2016. The same year, Nepal Sadbhawana Party also held its general conventions in April.The JSP-Nepal has invited foreign dignitaries to the unity convention. The party's foreign affairs department chief, Arjun Thapa, said delegates from India, Malaysia, Azerbaijan, Spain, and Indonesia have already arrived in Nepal.Invitations have been extended to various parties, except the Janata Samajbadi Party led by Ashok Rai, which splintered from the JSP-Nepal. The Nepali Congress, the UML, the Maoist Centre, the Rastriya Swatantra Party, the Rastriya Prajantra Party, and the CPN (Unified Socialist) are other parties that will participate in the Janakpur convention. Party leaders say the opening ceremony will be held on Monday, whereas the closed session, which will discuss the party’s political documents, is scheduled for the subsequent days. \nNepali Congress General Secretary Gagan Thapa has joined the group of leaders calling for a constitutional amendment in order to address the underperforming provincial system and the political instability allegedly caused by the mixed electoral system the country constitutionally endorsed nearly a decade ago. After a change in coalition at the centre began to affect provincial governments, voices for reforming the electoral system through constitutional amendment are growing louder. Speaking at a programme in Kathmandu on Saturday, Thapa, a general secretary of the largest party in the House of Representatives, argued that reforming the electoral system had become necessary to ensure political stability. He also said that the provinces’ performance so far shows that the federal system cannot be sustained in its current form. “By reform in the provincial structure, I do not mean scrapping the federal system altogether, which the country cannot afford,” Thapa told the Post when asked to explain his statement. “The issue of governments’ formation in the provinces has been challenged in court. This is a result of lack of clarity on provincial government formation in the constitution.”The government formation process in Koshi and Gandaki provinces have been challenged multiple times, and the Supreme Court has many times invalidated the chief ministerial appointment and election processes in the two provinces.Questions have been raised over the expenditures for running the provincial governments. “To address this issue, we need to downsize the elected representatives’ bodies not only in the provinces but also at the federal level. For that, we need constitutional reform,” Thapa added. “We bear a collective responsibility to protect and sustain the constitution. This, however, requires some amendments. Reform in the electoral system is as important,” Thapa emphasised. The provinces followed the same process of government formation practised at the centre and that caused problems, he said. Thapa stressed that amendments to the constitution could address all these issues.The Congress leader says it is wrong to advocate either for scrapping the federal system altogether or and fully retaining the constitutional provisions on the provinces. The Rastriya Prajantara Party, which bats for the revival of the Hindu Kingdom, has been demanding the scrapping of the country’s federal structure. The Rastriya Swatantra Party, which was formed two years ago, also wants the provincial structure overhauled. The new party says it wants to downsize the middle layer of the federal system. The party hasn’t participated in the provincial elections.Former National Assembly member Khim Lal Devkota, who is also an expert on federalism and a columnist at The Post, sees a slim chance of any changes in the federal system even though “it is necessary”.“I have closely worked with Nepal’s top political leaders. I believe they won’t readily amend the constitution,” Devkota told the Post. “The longer we take to amend the constitution, the more questions there will be on the longevity of the constitution.” During the Congress Mahasamiti meeting held in February, many leaders raised their voices in favour of filling all seats of the lower house of the federal parliament through direct election. Instead of electing a section of the lower house under the Proportional Representation (PR) system, the leaders had suggested that the upper house of the parliament be filled exclusively through the PR system. They were of the view that Nepal would not have a stable government unless all the lower house members were directly elected by their constituencies.Devkota is also of the opinion that Nepal needs to reform the election system. The mixed electoral system should be changed to create an environment for political instability, he said.In the 275-strong federal lower house, 165 are directly elected, whereas 110 come from the PR category. The upper chamber has 59 members. Of them, 56 are chosen through an electoral college comprising provincial assembly members and the chiefs and deputy chiefs of local units. Each province elects eight members, while three are appointed by the President on the recommendation of the Council of Ministers.Likewise, among the 550 members in the seven provincial assemblies, 220 are elected under the PR category. This number is large compared to the population size and thus needs to be reduced significantly, say experts.However, Krishna Pokharel, a professor of political science, blames the political leaders for the current problems of the provinces. Top politicians are using provincial governments and assemblies to place their second- and third-tier leaders. This has burdened the state without yielding any tangible results, he added. Pokharel says this represents a failure of the leadership rather than the federal system.Since the inception of the provincial system, political parties have appointed chief ministers on a rotational basis, Pokharel told the Post. “It is true that there are operational problems in the provinces, but leaders are more responsible for this than the system.” Even though the state structure is federal, political parties have yet to adopt the three-tier system within their organisations, he said. “What stops the political parties from giving autonomy to their provincial committees and letting them make decisions regarding the provinces on their own?” Pokharel questioned.Devkota, however, said two models should be considered to ensure the stability of provincial governments.The first involves distributing the government leadership positions based on the number of seats won in the election, and the second concerns implementing provisions similar to those at the local government level. According to the first model, the chief minister and other positions are distributed based on the number of seats shared in the provincial assembly elections, and the government is run among the constituent parties on a consensus basis.As per the second method, the chief minister is directly elected by voters, similar to the election of mayors or chairs at the local units. This makes the chief ministers fully accountable to the people. The chief minister can be removed by a two-thirds majority of the provincial assembly, thus preventing one from being an autocrat. One of the major concerns is the destabilising linkage of provincial politics with the power equation in Kathmandu. When the coalition at the centre changes, governments in the provinces also change.The subnational governments changed immediately after the change in coalition partners in Kathmandu on March 4. When Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal changed ruling partners, the second-largest party in the House of Representatives, CPN-UML, joined the government while the largest force, the Congress, was ousted from power. The changes at the centre immediately triggered changes in the provinces as well. \nPolice on Friday arrested two people from Thimi of Bhaktapur for allegedly mining cryptocurrency.The Central Investigation Bureau took 50-year-old Biswas Gurung and Rajendra Tahamata, 25, into custody in connection with the crime, said Hobindra Bogati, spokesperson for the bureau.The duo allegedly ran mining operations from the CTEVT’s information technology lab using a server and 64 desktops, on which blockchain applications were found during a preliminary investigation. Further investigation into the matter is underway. \nThe Central Investigation Bureau has arrested three individuals on charges of embezzlement of over Rs74 million of the Kathmandu-based Square Savings and Credit Cooperative.Those arrested include cooperative chair Basudev Man Joshi, 66, of Kathmandu Metropolitan City-14; secretary Subarna Selalik, 67, of Kathmandu-25; and member Dharma Ratna Pachhai, 58, of Kathmandu-26.Superintendent of Police Hobindra Bogati, who is also the spokesperson for the CIB, said they were arrested on Friday. On Sunday, Kathmandu District Court remanded them for a week for further investigation.According to him, the cooperative operators have been accused of luring depositors with the promise of attractive interest rates but failing to return their deposits. \nDays after Kathmandu Mayor Balendra Shah joined the Nepali Congress in accusing CPN-UML chair KP Sharma Oli in a multi-billion-rupee failed land swap bid in Jhapa, lawmakers from the main opposition have backed Shah in his initiative to expand the sidewalks at New Road—something the UML opposes.Speaking in the House of Representatives on Thursday, Congress General Secretary Bishwo Prakash Sharma backed the mayor's plan to expand pedestrian lanes at New Road that clashed with the vision of the Road Division, led by a UML minister, to widen the roads instead. Lawmaker Sharma said that in case of conflict between a central agency and a local unit, the federal government should show more restraint than the local government.“Mayor Balendra Shah’s initiative to widen pavements at New Road is the right step for the general public’s convenience,” Sharma told the House. “Mayor Shah should be allowed to continue his work without any interference as what he is doing is absolutely right.”The conflict escalated when the Road Division, under the federal government, intervened and paved the road cut by the metropolis on Monday. The metropolis had cleared stretches a few metres wide on either side of the road to create space for pavements. The dispute resulted in a standoff between those deployed by the Road Division and the Kathmandu municipal staff, with different people taking different sides. The tension eased without any untoward incident as the metropolis backed off after the federal government deployed police at the site.The Road Division, under the Ministry of Physical Infrastructure and Transport, is led by Deputy Prime Minister Raghubir Mahaseth, who is a UML secretary. The dispute grew to involve those supporting Mayor Shah and the UML, the biggest partner in the Pushpa Kamal Dahal-led coalition, and also spilled over to social media.In Parliament, lawmakers from the main opposition Nepali Congress threw their weight behind Shah.Not only the party’s general secretary Sharma, two other lawmakers from the party also expressed their support for the mayor in the House meeting on Thursday. Congress lawmaker Arjun Narsingh KC said the conflict between the federal government and the Kathmandu mayor has raised serious questions about the federal government’s intent. KC stressed that cooperation and collaboration between the federal, provincial, and local governments is essential in avoiding conflict and resolving disputes between the three federal units. He said Articles 232 and 235 of the constitution and related schedules clearly define their jurisdictions.“The recent conflict between the federal and local governments and the saga of making and breaking of a road section have raised serious questions,” KC said. He urged the government not to resort to violence and to resolve the issue in a rational way.Another Congress lawmaker, Kanti Sejuwal, also speaking in the zero hour of Parliament, questioned the government for clashing with the municipal authority. “Either we should scrap the Local Government Operation Act 2017, or the federal government should let Balendra work.”As the Road Division intervened in Mayor Shah’s plan to widen the pavement in the New Road area, Sejuwal had expressed his anger at UML chair Oli.Following the federal agency’s intervention, the mayor wrote on social media, alleging Oli’s involvement in the attempted illegal swapping of land at the Birtamode-based Giri Bandhu Tea Estate worth billions of rupees. The largest party, the Congress, had been accusing the UML chief of being complicit in the land swap issue.A few days ago, Shah also engaged in a heated exchange with the KMC’s Ward 22 chairman Chinkaji Maharjan, a UML member, over the sidewalk expansion. Even before that, municipal staff dumped a truckload of dirt and trash outside the Kathmandu Road Division office, claiming that the delayed road expansion work from Kalanki to Maharajgunj had inconvenienced the public.Earlier, on May 14, the Congress parliamentary party meeting had decided to raise the issue of the tea estate land in Parliament. The Oli government, formed after the 2017 general elections, allowed the owners of the tea estate to swap 343.19 bighas (232.43 hectares) of land it occupied, based on a revision to the Land Act (1964). The Act was revised in January 2020, under the Oli administration, introducing a provision for allowing a swap or selling of land to pay off the tea estate’s liabilities if it went into liquidation. Asked if the Congress had backed the mayor as he alleged the UML chair Oli’s involvement in the Tea Estate land scam, the Congress publicity department head Min Bahadur Bishwokarma denied it. “Party lawmakers including the general secretary must have backed the mayor as the New Road sidewalk issue is of public concern, and not necessarily because it involves the UML,” Bishwokarma said. \nDead bodies of a man and a woman were found on a cliff in Dakshinkali Municipality-8, located on the southern outskirts of Kathmandu.According to the Kathmandu Valley Police Office, the bodies were spotted approximately 200 metres down the hill from the Kathmandu-Dakshinkali road.Senior Superintendent of Police Dinesh Raj Mainali said that the preliminary investigation suggests they died in an accident, as a crashed motorcycle was found near the bodies.Mainali said a disaster management team of Nepal Police is working to retrieve the bodies from the hill. He said locals informed the police after spotting the bodies on Wednesday evening.The police said the deceased woman is a 32-year-old resident of Changunarayan Municipality-5, while the man is yet to be identified. \nWith the monsoon just around the corner, the Kathmandu Metropolitan City has finally started repairing the Sisdole road that leads to the Bancharedanda landfill in Nuwakot district. Officials said they started fixing potholes, concreting and other works on Wednesday.“We have allocated Rs30 million for the repairs, and the work started on Wednesday after completing the tender process,” said Rabinman Shrestha, chief of the Environment Department of the Kathmandu Metropolitan City (KMC). “We have asked the contractor to complete the work at the earliest in view of the looming monsoon.”Every year, garbage disposal is affected during the monsoon season due to rain, landslides, and poor road conditions. Sometimes, garbage disposal is disrupted due to obstructions by the residents living in settlements near and around the landfill site. These obstructions result in a complete halt in door-to-door garbage collection for weeks, leading locals in the Valley to discard their trash on the streets and causing chaos in the city.“We are aware of the risks associated with obstructions in garbage disposal and their consequences,” said Shrestha. “We have been taking measures accordingly to lessen all possible risks.”The metropolis said that around 200 metres of road near the Sisdole area, which is often damaged by garbage trucks and excavators, will be concretised.Meteorologists in Nepal anticipate the onset of monsoon by the end of next week, a few days ahead of the usual June 13 arrival of the weather system from the Bay of Bengal.KMC is also considering purchasing a high-pressure pump to prevent the overflow of leachate from the dumping ground. Recently, locals in the Sisdole area protested and stopped the trucks from disposing of garbage alleging the KMC’s negligence in leachate control.Municipal officials said that the Ministry of Urban Development took away a high-pressure pumpset from the landfill site's leachate pond some three months ago for maintenance, but has yet to return it. Landfill leachate is a hazardous liquid containing harmful bacteria, chemicals and other components. It forms when rainwater passes through a landfill or when organic matter decomposes naturally.Officials say the leachate needs to be re-injected into the landfill, which quickens the decomposition process of the landfill waste and prevents the liquid from flowing into the river. The city office has also started segregating degradable and bio-non-degradable waste materials from households in its seven wards. Wards 5, 7, 10, 12, 24 and 27 have been segregating the waste materials generated in the households. The city office has also arranged separate trucks for collecting segregated waste materials from the households.Degradable waste materials are being turned into compost at the KMC’s waste transfer station. Officials said that the metropolis has also been using reagents to expedite the compost-making process.Waste segregation at the source was one of the measures Mayor Balendra Shah touted as a solution to Kathmandu’s chronic garbage problem. After he assumed office, Shah asked city residents to start segregating waste at the source. They started doing so, using separate bins in their homes. But the plan didn’t work, largely due to a lack of preparations on the KMC’s part.The Kathmandu Valley generates over 1,200 tonnes of solid waste every day, nearly 60 percent of which comes from the KMC alone. Experts say 60 percent of organic waste originating in the Valley can be converted into compost and the remaining 30 percent of non-degradable waste can be recycled. \nNepal Oil Corporation has reduced the prices of petroleum products, effective from Saturday midnight. The price of petrol has been cut by Rs3 while diesel and kerosene have also become cheaper by Re1 each. Consumers will now have to pay Rs165 for a litre of petrol and Rs152 for a litre of diesel and kerosene in Kathmandu, Pokhara and Dipayal. Likewise, petrol will now cost Rs164 and diesel and kerosene Rs151 per litre in Surkhet and Dang. It will cost Rs162.50 for petrol and Rs149.50 for diesel and kerosene in Charaali, Biratnagar, Janakpur, Amlekhgunj, Bhalwari, Nepalgunj, Dhangadhi and Birgunj. \nThailand is on the brink of becoming the ultimate destination for the LGBTQIA+ community, thanks to its welcoming environment and the recent launch of the Pink Plus Economy initiative.This revolutionary move, announced on June 9 by Borderless.lgbt, aims to create a supportive ecosystem for LGBTQIA+ individuals in Thailand, encompassing living, family planning, and retirement.According to the reports, Thailand Privilege, a state-owned enterprise dedicated to long-term visas, backs the initiative. The support for the Pink Plus Economy is bolstered by Thailand’s National Legislative Assembly’s recent legalisation of same-sex marriage and upcoming policies favouring LGBTQIA+ family planning.If the legislation is approved by the Senate, Thailand will join Taiwan and Nepal as the only Asian nations to permit same-sex marriage.According to the report, Thailand is ready to welcome more than 200 million LGBTQIA individuals from around the world to wed, live, play, innovate, plan a family and retire in the country.Borderless.lgbt, supported by Thailand Privilege, will offer a series of \"Pink Plus\" membership packages with multi-merchant offerings, including a Thailand Privilege card, a state-of-the-art immersive telemedicine platform with renowned medical experts, shopping vouchers, retirement living programmes and pink tech innovation workshops.Other facilities are family wellness support, dedicated financial planning services, home buying/leasing support and exclusive resort staycations, which will be rolled out for distribution via global resellers. “We are very excited to be part of the journey of how Thailand transforms itself to be a global Diversity, Equality and Inclusion (DE&I) hub. Living in Thailand can now come with inclusive lifestyle, wellness and innovation,” says Manatase Annawat, president of Thailand Privilege.Interested resellers can apply to undertake a training course at www.borderless.lgbt. The successful trainee who passes the training and DE&I assessment will be awarded a certificate of attendance which will entitle him/her the right to distribute selected \"Pink Plus\" packages in accordance with the assessment scores.A high-tech call centre with a soundproof concierge suite is also established in the heart of the trendiest precinct, Thonglor, in cosmopolitan Bangkok to serve the “Pink Plus” members. \nThe 21st replenishment meeting of the International Development Association (IDA21) is scheduled to be held in Kathmandu on June 18.Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal will deliver a keynote address at the opening session of the four-day meeting.The session will be led by the co-chairs of the IDA21 replenishment—World Bank Senior Managing Director Axel van Trotsenburg and Sheku Sambadeen Sesay, the IDA21 Independent Co-Chair.Faris Hadad-Zervos, the World Bank country director for Maldives, Nepal, and Sri Lanka, said the major event, to be held in Kathmandu for the first time, will bring more than 200 IDA delegates representing both donors and recipients.IDA is the part of the World Bank that invests in the future of people and the planet, with projects across 75 countries. Established in 1960, IDA aims to reduce poverty by providing grants and zero- to low-interest loans for programmes that boost economic growth, reduce inequalities, and improve people’s living conditions.Replenishing IDA’s resources will be a key topic of the meeting, which comes at the midpoint of a funding cycle concluding in December 2024—when donors commit to contributions for July 2025 to June 2028.The June 18 session kicks off four days of closed-door meetings to discuss IDA21’s proposed focus areas, assess the financing needs of countries supported by IDA, and consider financing scenarios.The overarching theme for IDA21 is ‘ending poverty on a livable planet: delivering impact with urgency and ambition’.To fulfil this, the IDA21 policy package will have five focus areas: people, planet, prosperity, infrastructure and digitalisation, supported by four lenses of gender, jobs, fragility, conflict and violence, and private investments. The current replenishment (IDA20) ends on June 30, 2025.The target, or a narrow range of scenarios, for the pledging session, is typically agreed upon at the fourth replenishment meeting in October. IDA21 resources will be available for commitments for a three-year period starting July 1, 2025, through June 30, 2028.IDA will continue to provide special support for countries affected by fragility, conflict, and violence and utilise windows to provide additional resources specific to key thematic priorities, such as crisis response, addressing regional challenges, and providing blended finance for private sector investments in IDA countries, among others.“IDA is scaling up its market share significantly, also enabling co-financing and coordinating donor resources to maximise impact. IDA is a transparent, accountable, and cost-effective platform that delivers results, making it a prime investment for global development finance. So you can get a sense of how important this meeting is,” said Hadad-Zervos.He said that Nepal's development story is original. “It is one of economic transformation in the face of various challenges. It faced almost every challenge that a country could face—conflict, earthquakes, Covid, climate crisis, floods, and many others.”“This confluence has put Nepal's development gains at risk. Yet Nepal is a very resilient country. And despite these challenges, it has achieved significant development progress,” he said.Shree Krishna Nepal, joint-secretary at the finance ministry, said that the World Bank Group’s first economic mission to Nepal was in 1963 to assess the country's developing prospects and challenges. The group approved its first credit in 1969 for a telecommunications project that continues to be transformative today.Since then, IDA has provided Nepal with $6 billion in credits and grants. Currently, the World Bank is supporting 24 projects worth $2.3 billion. The World Bank said IDA is also helping transform the lives of millions of Nepalis through investments in education, health, jobs and skills, connectivity and infrastructure, social protection, food security, and others.A robust IDA 21 replenishment will ensure that IDA countries continue to benefit from it and that IDA continues its decades-long track record of lifting millions of people out of poverty, providing quality education for children, ensuring access to health services, and creating jobs so that people in low-income countries can become self-sustainable and living, according to the multilateral funding agency. \nChildren aged between five and 11 years with compromised immunity will be administered the Covid vaccine, according to health officials.The Covax facility, the United Nations-backed international vaccine-sharing scheme, has agreed to provide 100,000 doses of the children’s vaccine, and supply will start in the last week of June, according to officials at the Ministry of Health and Population.“These 100,000 doses are part of the 2.5 million doses, which Covax had agreed to supply to Nepal in 2024,” said Dr Abhiyan Gautam, chief of the Immunisation Section at the Family Welfare Division under the Department of Health Services. “Children between five and 11 having underlying conditions—cancer, HIV, and others will be administered the vaccine.”Last month, Nepal confirmed the spread of the Covid sub-lineages KP.1, KP.2, KP.3, and KP.4 in the country. All the sub-variants are offshoots of the Omicron variant, which is considered responsible for the surge in new Covid cases in the last few months.Hospitals in Kathmandu had reported a surge in serious cases of Covid infection in April. Doctors attending the infected patients had said that elderly people and those with underlying conditions were getting severe.The Covax facility supplied millions of doses of various brands of the coronavirus vaccine, which were used to inoculate the majority of the country's population.Officials said that Nepal will receive 1.6 million doses of Pfizer-BioNTech monovalent vaccine by the end of this month, including the children’s vaccine, from Covax. The rest of the doses of the monovalent vaccine to be received later will be administered to the adult population in all provinces of the country. The monovalent or single component is designed for the Omicron variant XBB.1.5 of SARS-CoV-2.Earlier, the facility used to supply Pfizer-BioNTech bivalent vaccine doses that included a component of the original virus strain as well as a part of the Omicron variant to provide broad protection against Covid.The vaccine is called a bivalent Covid shot as it contains two components: the original virus strain and Omicron BA.4 and BA.5 sub-variants.Over 12,000 people died, and hundreds of thousands were infected in the first, second and third waves of the Covid pandemic. \nAt least one case of cholera, a highly contagious and potentially fatal disease, has been confirmed in Kathmandu.According to the Sukraraj Tropical and Infectious Disease Hospital, a 62-year-old man from Makwanpur district, who had been admitted with severe diarrhoea some two weeks ago, tested positive for the deadly disease.The man is said to have been residing in Kathmandu for a long time.“The health condition of the patient was serious when he was brought to our hospital,” said a health worker serving at the Hospital’s Emergency Department, asking not to be named, as the official was not authorised to speak to the media. “The stool test confirmed a cholera infection.”According to health workers at the hospital, Vibrio cholera 01 Ogawa serotype has been confirmed in stool samples of infected patients.Cholera is a highly infectious disease that causes severe diarrhoea and vomiting, which causes dehydration and can lead to death within a few hours if left untreated. The World Health Organisation says cholera is a global threat to public health and an indicator of inequality and a lack of social development.The Kathmandu Valley witnessed a massive cholera outbreak in the monsoon of 2022 in which 77 cholera-positive cases were confirmed. Hundreds of people suffered from diarrheal infections that continued for months.Experts say an outbreak of cholera in Kathmandu Valley before the onset of the monsoon is concerning, as rainwater contaminates most water resources, increasing the risk of more people getting infected from water-borne diseases including cholera. “More people could have been infected with cholera, as not all cases become severe and not all patients do not go to the hospital for treatment,” said Dr Sher Bahadur Pun, chief of the Clinical research unit at the Sukraraj Hospital. “Many patients buy medicines from nearby pharmacies to recover at home. Only serious cases end up in hospitals.”Meanwhile, officials at the Health Office Kathmandu said that they are unaware of any confirmed cholera cases in the district. “We don’t have information about a cholera outbreak in recent days,” said Dr Arjun Sapkota, chief of the Health Office in Kathmandu. “We are the agency responsible for investigating the causes of outbreaks of deadly diseases, and as of today (Friday) we don’t have such information.”Sapkota informed that one case of cholera infection was reported from Sitapaila in Kathmandu about three months ago. An Indian national who is a truck driver was admitted to the Sukraraj Hospital at that time.“We had mobilised our team to investigate the source of the outbreak,” said Sapkota. Doctors warn that concealing outbreaks of deadly diseases such as cholera and failing to investigate their sources and inform the public about the risks can prove counterproductive, as the deadly bacteria keep spreading in communities if preventative measures are not taken.Due to poor sanitation and hygiene conditions, Nepal is highly vulnerable to water-borne diseases including diarrhoea, dysentery, typhoid, hepatitis, and cholera, with thousands of people getting infected with them every year.Doctors say contaminated water and food are the main catalysts for the spread of cholera in the Kathmandu Valley. Last year, health authorities administered an oral cholera vaccine in wards 11, 12, and 13 of the Kathmandu Metropolitan City that were highly affected by the outbreak. In October 2021, a Vibrio cholera outbreak in several local units of Kapilvastu district killed at least four people including three minors—boys aged seven and two, and a five-year-old girl. Another deceased was a 45-year-old man.Following the outbreak, the Health Ministry had launched a mass vaccination drive against the disease after all its attempts failed to curb the infection.The World Health Organisation says that a multifaceted approach is key to controlling cholera and reducing deaths.Doctors say launching awareness drives against water-borne diseases and ensuring safe drinking water are the only ways to save people from dying of water-borne diseases, including cholera.A combination of careful survey, ensuring safe drinking water, maintaining sanitation and hygiene, social mobilisation, and treatment is required to contain the spread of the infection, according to doctors. \nPost-monsoon is considered the dengue epidemic season. However, most districts in the country have already reported outbreaks of the deadly disease even before the onset of monsoon.Public health experts have warned of a massive outbreak of the potentially deadly virus in the coming days, as the monsoon is just around the corner, and authorities are not doing much to prevent outbreaks.“Except counting the number of infected people and releasing statements, not much of substance is being done,” said Dr Baburam Gautam, a public health expert. “The general public has stopped taking such statements on dengue infection seriously.”Dengue is a viral disease transmitted by female Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes. The same vectors also transmit chikungunya, yellow fever, and Zika virus, according to the World Health Organisation.According to data provided by the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division, at least 1,105 people from 69 districts have been infected with the dengue virus since January this year. Among the 69 districts that reported dengue outbreaks, Kathmandu has the highest number of cases: 112. Jhapa district recorded 109 cases, followed by Chitwan (73), Makwanpur (58), Sindhupalchok (44), Tanahun (39), Okhaldhunga (38), Doti (30), Rupandehi (28), and Bhaktapur (27). The three districts of the Valley—Kathmandu, Bhaktapur and Lalitpur—together reported 157 cases of infections in this period.Sindhupalchok, Rasuwa, and Kalikot are among the mountain districts that have reported dengue cases.Public health experts say reported cases could be just the tip of the iceberg, as around 80 percent of those infected are asymptomatic. Many people infected with dengue show mild symptoms and do not need treatment or can be treated with paracetamol at home.Last year, at least 20 persons died, and more than 52,000 were infected by the virus, which had spread to all 77 districts.In 2022, a total of 88 people died and over 54,000 were infected by the virus across the country. At the time, hospitals in the Kathmandu valley were overwhelmed with dengue patients and pharmacies had run out of paracetamol, the most widely used medicine to treat fever.In 2019, the disease killed at least six people and more than 16,000 were hospitalised across the country. The virus had spread to 68 districts at the time.Post-monsoon is considered a highly transmissible season for dengue, but Nepal has witnessed outbreaks of the deadly disease around the year, making the country endemic to the virus.Experts say this is the right time to prepare for and prevent possible outbreaks.Waiting for a massive outbreak would be a big mistake, they say. To reduce the risk, authorities should launch an awareness drive, step up vector surveillance, and take other measures. Health ministry officials said that they have alerted all related agencies to the risk of a dengue outbreak.“Even if massive outbreaks have not been seen in any place, many districts have already reported dengue cases,” said Gokarna Dahal, chief of the Vector Control Section at the division. “We have alerted all relevant agencies to the risk of an outbreak in the coming days.”Authorities and agencies in some local units have launched activities to raise residents' awareness of the risks, and we have urged all health agencies to take preventive measures, Dahal said.Epidemiologists and virologists say the dengue virus has emerged as a major public health issue in Nepal. They also say that despite thousands of people getting infected and scores dying from the disease, the authorities do not take it seriously. They said measures such as search-and-destroy and awareness drives should be initiated to contain the spread of virus-spreading vectors.Dengue-transmitting mosquitoes breed in clean water and bite people in daylight. Uncovered water tanks and discarded objects, such as plastic cups and bottles, could be breeding grounds for these mosquitoes.Symptoms include mild to high fever, severe muscle pain, rashes, severe headache, and pain in the eyes. Patients having these symptoms are advised to seek immediate treatment. While there is no specific cure for the disease, early detection and proper medical care can prevent death. \nSevere heat in the Tarai region has affected ongoing polio vaccination programmes.Officials at the Immunisation Section at the Family Welfare Division under the Department of Health Services say the immunisation campaign has been affected by school closures due to scorching heat.“The immunisation campaign will resume once schools resume their regular classes,” said Dr Abhiyan Gautam, chief of the Immunisation Section. “It will take more time for the campaign to complete due to the severe heat in Tarai districts.”Several districts’ maximum temperatures have either reached close to or crossed 40 degrees Celsius in the last few days. On Tuesday, Dhangadhi recorded 40.4 degrees Celsius, Nepalgunj 40.2 degrees Celsius and Birendranagar 37.3 degrees Celsius, the Met office’s data shows.Met officials anticipate monsoon will start at the end of next week and bring respite from scorching heat.Over 1.46 million children born between April 2016 and October 2018 are being inoculated with inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) in a nationwide immunisation drive started on May 26.Officials said that children who missed the IPV vaccine during the routine immunisation programme will be administered the vaccine, as they are at risk of getting infected with Type-2 polio.Gautam said that vaccination programmes are being carried out smoothly in the rest of the places. The vaccine is being administered in schools, booths and health posts.Nepal has been polio-free since 2010, but the World Health Organisation officially declared it polio-free on March 27, 2014 after maintaining zero polio cases for three consecutive years.After introducing the IPV vaccine in September 2014, the country switched to the bivalent oral poliovirus vaccine (bOPV0) from the trivalent oral poliovirus vaccine (tOPV).The trivalent oral poliovirus vaccine contains all three types of poliovirus: Type-1, Type-2, and Type-3. The current oral poliovirus vaccine is made up of live, attenuated poliovirus.The trivalent poliovirus vaccine was effective against all three types of poliovirus.However, the Type -2 component of this vaccine can lead to the circulation of vaccine-derived viruses. Its use was linked to a vaccine associated with paralytic polio, a condition in which children develop paralysis.Nepal became the first country in the South Asia region to incorporate the IPV vaccine in its routine immunisation programme in line with the UN Health body’s endgame strategic plan to eliminate the risk of vaccine-derived poliovirus and phase out all oral polio vaccines in the routine immunisation programme.IPV consists of inactivated poliovirus strains of all three poliovirus types.Gautam said that due to global shortages of the IPV vaccine, children born between April 13, 2016, and October 18, 2018 were inoculated only with the bivalent oral poliovirus vaccine.“Children who missed the IPV vaccine will be at high risk of poliovirus infection,” Gautam said. “So we are launching a campaign to inoculate them.”Health officials say that children should continuously receive the bivalent poliovirus vaccine, even if they are administered the IPV vaccine, as the bivalent poliovirus vaccine is also necessary for intestinal immunity, while IPV provides mucosal immunity.Childhood immunisation is the number one priority of the government, under which 13 types of vaccines are given against a range of diseases, including measles-rubella, pneumonia, tuberculosis, diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus, hepatitis B, rotavirus, Japanese encephalitis and typhoid under the regular immunisation programme, free of cost.Regular immunisation is one of the most successful programmes in Nepal, with a high coverage rate. The country has demonstrated remarkable progress in reducing the under-five mortality rate and the regular immunisation programme is credited with that.The Nepal Demographic and Health Survey-2022, carried out by the Ministry of Health and Population, however, showed that at least four percent of the children aged between 12 and 23 months received no vaccine at all.This figure was one percent in 2016.The Ministry of Health and Population said that the vaccine coverage rate for polio is 95 throughout the country. \nThe 16th five-year periodic plan, proposed by the National Planning Commission, aims to reduce neonatal deaths to 13 from the existing 21 in every 1,000 live births. Public health experts, however, are sceptical of its success, as neonatal deaths have not declined since 2016, and the measures taken at present are not sufficient to lessen the ongoing death rates.“Both the Nepal Demographic and Health Survey-2022 and the finance ministry’s recent report show neonatal deaths constantly high,” said Dr Shyam Raj Upreti, former director general at the Department of Health Services. “It will not be easy to pick high-hanging fruits. It requires a lot of investments and micro planning, which are currently lacking.”A recent report by the Ministry of Finance shows that 21 neonates die in every 1,000 live births, the same results shown by the Nepal Demographic and Health Survey-2022, carried out by the Ministry of Health and Population.The government’s target for Sustainable Development Goals is to reduce neonatal mortality to 12 deaths per every 1,000 live births by 2030.The SDGs, a follow-up on the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), aim to end poverty, hunger, and all forms of inequality in the world by 2030. Nepal has committed to meeting the goals.The 16th five-year plan, which starts next fiscal year and ends in 2029, is aligned with the SDG targets.Public health experts say meeting the goal is easier said than done. Most health facilities having birthing centres lack neonatal units, trained human resources, and quality services.“Without ensuring quality services, which require trained human resources and advanced facilities, among others, it is impossible to reduce neonatal deaths,” said Upreti. “The government has made various plans to reduce child deaths—including neonatal deaths—but does not pay much attention to their effective implementation.”The finance ministry’s recent report shows that the institutional delivery rate increased to 80 percent from 79 percent last year. The rise in institutional deliveries has contributed to lessening the maternal mortality rate, which is 151 in every 100,000 live births.“Fifty percent of the neonates die in the first 24 hours of birth,” said Dr Abhiyan Gautam, chief of the Immunisation Section at the Family Welfare Division of the Department of Health Services. “Most of our health facilities, including birthing centres, lack proper infrastructures.”Study shows that 85 percent of all deaths among children under the age of five in Nepal take place before a child’s first birthday, with 64 percent occurring during the first month of life.Along with trained human resources, infrastructures and quality services, deaths of neonates are also linked to the antenatal care visit of pregnant women, access to health facilities, timely referral system and others, experts say. The government has been taking various measures to reduce neonatal deaths, including planning to set up a ‘special newborn care unit’ in all district hospitals throughout the country. For that, concerned agencies under the health ministry have imparted training to all doctors, nurses and paramedics serving in Nuwakot, Dhading, Sindhupalchok and Makawanpur district hospitals.Special newborn care units are general units designed to care for newborn children who fall ill shortly after birth. Doctors, nurses, and paramedics monitor ailing children admitted to the unit.The health ministry has installed an underfloor heating system at birthing centres in four mountain districts to curb postpartum and neonatal deaths there.Underfloor heating is a form of central heating that ensures indoor climate control for thermal comfort. It uses an electrical heating cable installed underneath the flooring.Hypothermia, infection, low birth weight, premature birth, and abnormal birth asphyxia are among the leading causes of neonatal deaths, doctors say.Some of the programmes being undertaken to lower child mortality include newborn care, kangaroo care, exclusive breastfeeding, infection prevention, chlorhexidine for umbilical cord care, and free neonatal care. “Whatever the achievements we made so far were achieved by the measures taken as of now,” said Upreti. “The ongoing programme may not achieve further progress. Government must implement the programmes and plans to prevent more deaths.” \nNepali chef Aditya Mishra promotes Nepali cuisine in New York through his supper club, \"The Sewing Tin,\" which blends traditional flavors with modern culinary techniques while highlighting the challenges and opportunities of being an outsider in the competitive culinary scene.\nCeleus Baral, a talented baker and environmental science student, runs Bakeleus, selling a range of baked goods made with local produce and a commitment to sustainability, offering three easy-to-bake recipes for carrot cakes, mulberry fudge cakes, and strawberry casseroles.\nPotato is a widely cultivated and highly nutritious staple crop in Nepal, with a high yield and diverse culinary uses; however, excessive consumption of processed potato products (chips, fries) can lead to health concerns.\nChicken eggs are a healthy, versatile food that provide essential nutrients, promote weight loss, and protect against various health conditions, with Nepal being self-sufficient in egg production.\nPiano Piano South, an Italian restaurant in Lalitpur, offers a garden dining area, a revised menu with a variety of Italian dishes, and a selection of wines, providing a tranquil escape with culinary delights.\nMundhum Trek in Koshi province in the eastern part of Nepal is a new cultural walking trail. It passes through several indigenous ethnic villages and landscapes in Khotang and Bhojpur districts. This trail goes up to an elevation of 4,200 metres to the viewpoint of Silchung Peak and takes one through the settlements of the Kirati people. This route starts from Diktel Bazaar and passes through beautiful settlements like Chakhewa, Rawa Dhap, Salpa Bhanjyang, Silchung and Hanspokhari before ending in Bhojpur. There are some hotels in Diktel but trekkers are advised to carry tents. The trail offers panoramic views of most of the eight-thousanders, including Everest, Lhotse, Makalu, Cho Oyu and Kanchenjunga mountains. The spring season, March through May, is highly recommended for the trek.Janaki Mandir Janaki Mandir at Janakpur in Madhesh province was constructed in 1874 and is a blend of Mughal and local architecture. The temple is a three-storey building and has 60 rooms, making it the largest temple in Nepal. Pilgrims flock here by the thousands to pay homage to Janaki Mandir—Janaki being the other name of Sita, the daughter of King Janak. The temple houses an idol of Sita which was found near Ayodhya, the kingdom of Ram. The marriage anniversary of Lord Ram and Sita is celebrated in Janakpur every year on Vivaha Panchami, which falls in December. In the southwest corner of Janaki Mandir is the Vivaha Mandap, which has been built at the site where the marriage of Ram and Sita is said to have taken place. Another well-known temple in the vicinity is Ram Mandir, which is built in pagoda style and is hence different from the other temples in Janakpur that generally bear resemblance to Mughal architecture. It houses a female statue, said to be of Yogamaya, which has the reputation of being one of the most beautiful images of female forms in Nepal. Other holy sites of interest include the Laxman Temple, Sankat Mochan Temple and Hanuman Temple.Kuri Village, Kalinchok Kuri village, a popular tourist destination around 150 km from Kathmandu, lies at an altitude of 3,842 metres above sea level in Kalinchowk of Dolakha district, in Bagmati province. People visit the place to enjoy the snow during the winter besides the mesmerising landscapes and splendid panoramic view of the Himalayan range. Kalinchok gets snow mainly at the end of December and the snowfall continues till the end of February or mid-March. When there is snow, it is difficult for jeeps, buses and cars to reach the top of Kuri village. Chains are wrapped around the wheels of vehicles and specially modified jeeps with highly experienced drivers are used to carry visitors. There are several hotels and restaurants in the area. The road up to Kuri has also improved over the years.Annapurna Base Camp Annapurna Base Camp trek, in Gandaki province, makes for a picturesque journey that takes you to the foothills of the Annapurna South, up to 4,130 metres above sea level. The five-day trek (seven days for slow walkers) offers rich cultural diversities, typical Nepali villages and the flora and fauna nestled at the foothills of Annapurna. The distance from Pokhara to Annapurna Base Camp is approximately 81 kilometres. It is among the shortest and most budget-friendly treks in Nepal. For Nepalis, lodging costs around $5 to $10 per day. For foreigners, the overall cost of the trek ranges from $800 to $1500 on average per person. Annapurna Base Camp trek can be done at any time throughout the year as each season offers a different trekking experience. The ideal time for the trek depends on your weather preferences and what you expect from it. However, autumn (September to October) and spring (March to May) are considered the two best seasons for the trek, as the days at the time are warm and bright with clear skies.Bardiya National Park Bardiya National Park, located in the southern Tarai belt of Lumbini province, is home to one of the most elusive and majestic animals on earth—the Royal Bengal Tiger. The park, which covers an area of 968 square kilometres, is considered one of the most important protected areas in the country. It is a prime destination for those looking to catch a glimpse of a tiger. A bit of luck and patience will offer a good chance to see the Bengal Tiger. The jungle safari also offers one the opportunity to spot Asian elephants and the greater one-horned rhinoceros. The rare Gangetic river dolphins are occasionally spotted on rafting trips along the Geruwa River, the eastern channel of the Karnali river. Besides, visitors can enjoy the homestays and explore local Tharu culture. The right time to visit the park is from mid-September to mid-December and mid-February to May.Khaptad National Park Khaptad National Park in Sudurpaschim province is a protected area in the far western region. It stretches over four districts of Bajhang, Bajura, Achham and Doti and ranges in elevation from 1,400 to 3,300 metres. The park can be visited throughout the year. Trekkers are advised to bring their tents, food and other supplies. The Nepal Tourism Board says of late, social media has been increasingly influencing Nepali travellers to go to Khaptad. Since the far-flung Khaptad National Park is still offbeat for many travellers, the area remains pristine and fresh. The seasons of spring (March-May) and autumn (October-November) are the ideal times to visit the park. The temperature ranges from 10°c to 20°c offering pleasant trekking weather. The monsoon begins in June and lasts until September and during this time, roads often become muddy and slippery. From December to February, winter brings snow and chilling winds to the park.Limi Valley \nOnce again, my heart swelled with joy when my hometown came into view.Arriving at Lalikharka after the treacherous journey through Pauwa Bhanjyang and the bustling Kanchhi Dokan, Phidim, the headquarters of Panchthar district, revealed itself like a surprise gift. My home town, Phidim, is unique in the fact that it reveals to travellers approaching it from uphill. As the vehicle descends the mountain road, it slowly comes into view, its houses and buildings recognisable for the native son.This Dashain, I undertook the much-awaited trip to my hometown with my wife Kabita and daughter Aarohi. Little did I anticipate the transformation that awaited me.The moment I got out of the jeep, I noticed that Phidim, nestled in the lush hills, has undergone a remarkable transformation over the years. As I guided my family to my home, which had suffered damages in the 1989 quake that struck eastern Nepal, I found that old, mud and stone houses had been replaced by concrete buildings. The place was vastly different from the one I remembered.Arriving at my childhood home felt like reuniting with an old friend. Navigating its nooks and crannies with my daughter, we delved into the history of the house, a symbol of my cherished memories.My wife had visited Phidim years ago, spending a month with my parents. She, too, recalled beautiful moments she had had in the town. I asked the tenant about the neighbours and acquaintances. Some had died, while others had left for good.A call to local journalist Giriraj Banskota led me to the school grounds, where memories flooded back. This was where I spent my teenage years, playing ball, learning to kick, and watching major tournaments. Here, I even encountered a group of Western climbers headed to Kanchenjunga, the world’s third-highest mountain. I remember being awed by their shiny yellow tents, headlights and strange smell. I remember practising my tutephuteko Angrezi with the climbers. Birendra Shield, an annual sports tournament named after the late king, brought ace players from various schools in Panchthar district. The district also hosted Yuba Mela, an annual three-day fair to commemorate the birthday of the king, organising football tournaments in which teams from as far as Sunsari and Taplejung participated. I never excelled at dribbling balls. A boy growing up in a seven-member family, I soon found my interest in literature. In the late 1980s, Phidim hosted a major literary festival. In the run-up to the 1990 pro-democracy protest, walls were painted with anti-monarchy slogans, local politicians were arrested. I took my family to my school, Naya Namuna Secondary School. It was Saturday, so the school was closed. I peeked through the steel gate and wall, imagining myself labouring over classes. Memories are hazy, but what I remember most is going out of the school—to quiz contests with me leading the school team, to essay competitions at the District Education Office and to play carom board, a national pastime, in a nearby shopfront. Returning to the main street, the demolition of a landmark gate made me reflect on how cities transform, shedding old landmarks for new identities. Navigating narrow alleyways, I felt like a stranger in my own hometown. Multistory buildings have emerged and roads have been paved, reshaping the town. It’s the same place with a different face, leaving me nostalgic for the Phidim of my memories.We finally reached Shivalaya temple, which I told my wife and daughter was one of my cherished hangouts. A giant statue of Falgunanda (the Kirant leader’s birthday is celebrated on November 10) stood before the steps to the temple. Though my wife suspected I came here to smoke, in reality, I visited the temple in the evening to meet friends and talk about issues that mattered most to us at the time. It also offered a panoramic view of the town (I could not take my family to Gadhi Danda, a hillock across the Shivalaya).Towards the end of my journey, I felt sad about Phidim’s lack of prospects. To my dismay, I found that people have been leaving the town in droves. Despite blacktopped roads and multi-story buildings, Phidim faces a troubling reality. The lack of quality higher education and specialist healthcare has driven people away, echoing the circumstances that led me to Kathmandu years ago. Conversations with locals confirmed a mass exodus from the town, a trend that raises concerns about Phidim's future.My conversations with familiar strangers led me to conclude that Phidim has transformed into a transit town for pilgrims heading to Pathibhara Devi Temple, which is around 255 kilometres north in Taplejung district. I met dozens of people headed to the holy site. While pilgrims see it as a stopover, for me, it was a homecoming. The realisation dawned that Phidim is, perhaps, in a state of transition, trading its rustic charm for the hallmarks of urbanisation. While I left Phidim for higher education in Kathmandu, people from rural areas have flocked to the town in search of better opportunities, bringing life and energy to the once quiet community.As we bid adieu to my hometown, I couldn’t help but reflect on the inevitability of leaving a place, no matter how enamoured one is with it. Passing Kanchhi Dokan, I pointed out Kanchnajungha and Kumbhakarna to my daughter—symbols of my childhood. Phidim, now a blend of nostalgia and change, remains etched in my heart, a testament to the intricate dance between memory and evolution. \nThe gate leading inside the city of Lucknow proudly declares, “Muskuraiye aap Lucknow mein hain” (Smile because you are in Lucknow). During my brief stay, the city lived upto its promise. Known as the city of Nawabs, with a rich history going centuries back, the city is abuzz with autos, rickshaws, honks of public buses and the constant loud sounds of the metro going over your head, irritable honks of public buses and food that leaves you wanting more.In such a happening place stands Bara Imambara, built in 1784 by Asaf-ud-Daula. ‘Bara’ means big, and ‘Imambara’ is a building with a big hall where people assemble for mourning congregations. This building was originally built to provide employment for the public because, at that period, the country was going through a famine, and it was seen as a relief project. I walked through the grand entrance gate known as Rumi Darwaza (Turkish Gate), wiping my sweat and fighting the Lucknow heat, entering the vast complex. Echoing in all corners was a voice from the speaker that kept reminding the visitors of the many rules inside the historical place. I tried not to let the wonder overwhelm me as I walked through the complex. To my right stood the elegant Asafi Mosque, recently painted in cream-like white. Its design is visually pleasing and a testament to the Mughal era’s artistic finesse. Its walls are adorned with intricate calligraphy and elegant designs, reminiscent of a time when such aesthetics held great importance. I couldn’t help but admire the tremendous effort the craftsmen put into bringing the Nawab’s vision to life, meticulously crafting the elegant domes which seemed to touch the sky. The mosque’s serene atmosphere stands in stark contrast to the bustling city just beyond its walls.Upon stepping into the main hall—known as Asafi Hall—I was immediately struck by its sheer size. It is vast and impressive, appearing to stretch into eternity, and its massive arched roof seemed to defy gravity. What’s even more intriguing is that it stands without the support of pillars or beams. The interlocking system of bricks, a hidden secret, upholds this colossal structure, leaving one in awe of the brilliance of the builders of the past.This very hall houses a large vaulted central chamber with the tomb of Asaf-ud-Daula. Standing beside his tomb was a chilling moment, knowing that the remains of a great historical figure was resting just a few feet below. After scanning the large hall, the guide took me to my favourite part of the Imambara—the labyrinth or the Bhool Bhulaiyaa. This labyrinth sits right above the main hall, and because the hall is unsupported, the ceiling had to be lightweight, so the hollow labyrinth was born. It is quite impossible to figure out the Bhool Bhulaiyaa on your own, as it is a confusing network of corridors and staircases. So, it is necessary to have the company and guidance of a guide.As I moved with my guide through the maze, I thought I could feel the presence of the past inhabitants who had walked through these confusing passageways. What fascinated me most was the maze’s design: every sound, no matter how faint, echoed through the structure, enhancing its aura of mystery.The guide whispered from a distance, his head close to the wall, and the sound reached my ears, even though he was out of sight. It felt as if the walls carried the whispers. We exchanged astonished glances. When the guide reappeared, he smiled and remarked, “Now, you understand why they say that walls have ears.”Exiting the maze, I climbed to the roof, which offered a breathtaking view of Lucknow. The city spread out in front of me, its modern skyline contrasting the monument’s historic charm. It was a moment of reflection, contemplating how centuries had passed, and yet, Bara Imambara stood as a timeless witness to the changing tides of history. As I stood there, taking it all in, I felt recharged by the air coming in from all directions. After descending from the terrace, my brisk guide led me to the final stop in the Imambara, Shahi Baoli (Stepwell). Also referred to as the royal stepwell, it sits underground and is another example of architectural brilliance in the complex. This didn’t surprise me much since it was built at a time when architecture wasn’t just functional but also a work of art.The moment I descended the steps that led me underground, I noticed the sudden drop in temperature. The Shahi Baoli served as a cool refuge during the blistering summer day. The well-planned architecture of the Baoli allowed it to naturally regulate its temperature. The way to the main well is locked, but visitors can throw coins through jail-like doors into the well in order to try out their luck, much like we do in Davis Falls in Pokhara.Entering the underground corridors, I felt a slight chill because it was cold and dimly lit. I turned on my phone’s flashlight and saw the walls adorned with intricate Mughal carvings. Upon reaching a spot where we could see the well, the guide informed us that the well acted as a CCTV camera at the time. He explained that individuals inside the structure could discreetly observe those entering, as their reflections would be visible on the well’s water, but the people entering could not see the people inside the building.I waited to see that happen, and when a group entered through the gate, I was stunned; their faces were perfectly mirrored on the water’s surface, showcasing the ingenuity behind the well’s design, serving both as a water source and a security measure.My experience at Bara Imambara was a delightful one. I had never seen such a remarkable work of architecture before—it is beautiful, interesting and ahead of its time. \nSerene, snow-capped mountains set against the bluest skies. It’s a heavenly sight in pictures but mighty hard to climb in real life. Climbing Everest, Annapurna, or Manaslu means enduring freezing cold, biting air, and days of physical and mental strain until you reach the summit. The journey is a slippery path of rocks, rivers, and bridges, navigated skillfully by experienced trekkers, locals, and guides. In 2022, Nepal welcomed 15,781 trekkers, highlighting the importance of climbing and trekking guides for the country's economy.For new trekkers, understanding the trek can be confusing. If you’re anxious about missing something in your backpack or need motivation to start a trek, here are tips from two seasoned guides to help you grasp the essentials.Meet Luckme Syangden, a 25-year-old climbing guide with extensive experience in the treacherous heights of Everest. According to Syangden, maintaining a positive mindset is the first step towards a successful climb, both before and throughout the entire process.Preparation for the journeyTrekking is undeniably demanding, both physically and mentally. However, maintaining a ‘can-do’ attitude can go a long way in pushing people to their destination, says Syangden. “We never force the people to push through if we think they’ve reached their limits, but we do try to use ourselves as an example to show that they can,” says Syangden. According to Syangden, when you’re guiding so many people through the process of climbing, you realise that everybody is different; their bodies have different needs and limitations. So it’s important to move forward while assessing their physical and mental well-being. “We always maintain a strong, positive mindset ourselves and strive to inspire our trekkers with the same optimism. Rushing them when they’re unwell isn’t our approach,” says Syangden.Manu Rai, 32, has been a trekking guide for three years. Her passion for physical activities and exploring the vast landscapes of her village led her to this profession. Rai, an avid walker and traveller, found her calling when she met fellow adventure enthusiasts who shared her love for hiking and trekking. According to Rai, engaging in physical activities and regular workouts can significantly enhance the strength needed for embarking confidently on a trek.For novice trekkers, it’s advisable to begin preparing at least a month prior to the trek. Joining a gym or engaging in physical activities like walking can make a significant difference. Start with a 20-minute walk on the first day and gradually extend the duration as the trek approaches. This gradual increase helps in building strength, endurance, and confidence. Additionally, regular stretching is essential to loosen the muscles, reducing the risk of injuries while navigating challenging terrains. Personally, I've found going to the gym and incorporating squats into my routine immensely beneficial in strengthening my leg muscles. Backpacking essentialsWhen backpacking, packing wisely is key. Rai advises opting for light yet warm clothing instead of bulky jackets to reduce the load. She recommends essentials like down jackets, caps, goggles, sunglasses, sunscreen, a stick, warmer, gloves, socks, and sturdy boots. Syangden, who also carries the same essentials, stresses the importance of carrying a safety knife and period supplies for female trekkers.Managing periods during treksManaging periods during treks can be challenging, as Syangden points out. “I carry all of the supplies that I need, but as you can imagine, handling period cramps and all the other symptoms while trekking through gruelling mountains is no easy task. I just do my best to power through it all,” says Syangden.Handling altitude sickness and injuriesRai advises trekkers to rest and wait if altitude sickness strikes. Carrying painkillers and paracetamol is essential. If conditions worsen, trekkers can choose to halt their trip. In such cases, communication with fellow travellers and guides is key. Guides can also arrange transportation for the trekker’s return if needed. Effective communication with trekkers and guidesSyangden highlights the importance of communication and building positive relationships with fellow trekkers. Over her journey from being a beginner to a seasoned guide, she has learned that talking and fostering a friendly rapport with clients significantly smoothens the trek.“In my initial guiding days, communication was tough, but now I can confidently lead trekking groups,” Syangden states.Challenges faced by a female trekkersBoth Syangden and Rai acknowledge the challenges faced by female trekkers. They often encounter underestimation and demeaning comments questioning their trekking abilities. Syangden has personally dealt with such remarks, reflecting a wider issue where being a woman is wrongly linked to an inability to handle the physical demands of trekking. Becoming a trekking guideTrekkers and adventure-seekers may come to the realisation that their love for the mountains and hills can translate itself to a profession that not only supports their own passion but also that of those enthusiastic about the secrets of the mountains. According to both Syangden and Rai, the first step is to connect with a trekking association and enrol in a trekking guide course. Rai explains that this course covers essential skills like map reading, navigation, guiding techniques, geography, safety measures, and environmental knowledge.Additionally, Syangden, who is currently undergoing a climbing course, mentions that colleges now offer bachelor’s programmes in mountaineering, providing a comprehensive education for aspiring guides. \nFive young women established Duluwa Outdoors in 2021 to encourage female travel in Nepal, providing a platform for shared experiences, empowering solo travel, and offering safety tips for women exploring Nepal's diverse destinations.\nGermany thrashed 10-man Scotland 5-1 on Friday with three goals in the first half to make a triumphant start to their Euro 2024 campaign and lay down a marker with the biggest opening game margin of victory in the tournament’s history.The Germans, hunting a record fourth European title and first major trophy after a barren decade, scored through Florian Wirtz, Jamal Musiala and a Kai Havertz penalty before Niclas Fuellkrug and Emre Can added two more late in the second half.Scotland, who had defender Ryan Porteous sent off on the stroke of halftime, got on the scoresheet in the 87th minute courtesy of Antonio Ruediger’s deflected own goal.Julian Nagelsmann’s Germany next face Hungary on Wednesday before taking on Switzerland in their final Group A match.“We played with a lot of intensity and played the right spaces, took some risks and that is why we scored. We played an outstanding first half and we were up 3-0,” Germany captain Ilkay Guendogan said.“That is how we wanted to start. I had a good feeling before the game and I was proved right.”“The start is what we wanted but still the goal we let in showed that all teams have quality and if you don't pay attention you will be punished.”The Scots, who lost Porteous for a studs-up challenge on Guendogan that earned the hosts their penalty, must quickly go back to the drawing board and regroup if they are to make it past the group stage for the first time in a major tournament.POWERFUL STARTThe Germans, who lost their opening matches at the 2018 and 2022 World Cups as well as the previous Euros in 2021, dominated possession from the start with the Scots defending high.That ambitious strategy proved fatal for the visitors, who left far too many open spaces at the back, and it did not take long for the hosts to punish them.Toni Kroos flighted a perfect 30-metre cross for Joshua Kimmich who timed his pass to Wirtz perfectly for the winger to drill home for a 10th minute lead and become the youngest scorer for Germany at a Euros aged 21.With Scotland still recovering, Germany struck again nine minutes later, with Guendogan slipping another ball past the Scottish backline, this time for Havertz on the left, with the forward laying it off for Musiala in the box to rifle home.It was the start all of Germany was hoping for as hundreds of thousands of supporters across several fan zones erupted with joy, but there was more to come with Porteus’ reckless challenge and dismissal conceding a spot kick Havertz easily converted.It was one-way traffic again after the break and Germany added a fourth through substitute Fuellkrug’s fiercely struck shot in the 69th as Scotland coach Steve Clarke, the first man to lead the team to back-to-back Euros, looked on helplessly.“First half, we just got it all wrong really, didn’t show up, weren’t aggressive enough, and we let good players get on the ball,” said Scotland captain Andy Robertson.“Second half, we’re down to 10 men and I thought the lads dug in really well. We have to bounce back quickly because there was lots wrong here and it’s a quick turnaround now.”Scotland, who did not have one effort on or off target, pulled a goal back late on when Ruediger inadvertently headed the ball into his own net but substitute Emre Can then curled home a fine shot in stoppage time for the Germans’ fifth goal.The reeling Scots next play the Swiss on Wednesday. \nNepal blew their chances of qualifying for the Super Eight of the 2024 ICC Men’s T20 World Cup after losing to South Africa by a single run in a last-over nail-biter at the Arnos Vale Ground in West Indies.The Rhinos had everything on the line and were in need of two runs off the last ball of the game when Gulshan Jha was caught between the wickets by Quinton de Kock.Earlier, the Rhinos put up a great bowling display, restricting South Africa, who were sent to bat first, to a lowly total of 115 runs.Opener Quinton de Kock managed to put 10 runs off 11 balls before being dismissed by Dipendra Singh Airee in 3.4 overs. Kushal Bhurtel then picked out South Africa captain Aiden Markram for a 22-ball 15 in 11.2 overs and had Heinrich Klaasen caught by Karan KC for a cheap three shortly after.Kock’s opening partner Reeza Hendricks managed to stay on the ground, smashing five hits to the fences and a maximum, accumulating 43 runs, highest of the innings, before being sent to the pavilion by Airee in 15.3 overs.Tristan Stubbs was the only other South African batter to score in double digits, putting an unbeaten 27 in his 18-knock play.Bhurtel claimed four wickets in his four-over spell, giving away just 19 runs. Similarly, Airee also bowled four overs, grabbing three wickets and conceding 21 runs.Despite the easy chase, Nepal found themselves on the losing end, putting up 114 runs at a loss of seven wickets at the end of the stipulated 20 overs.The Rhinos were off to a good start with openers Bhurtel and Aashif Sheikh building a decent first-wicket partnership. However, the tides turned quickly for Nepal as South Africa’s Tabraiz Shamsi struck twice in a single over, dismissing Bhurtel for 13 in 7.2 overs, and captain Rohit Paudel for a duck only two deliveries later.Sheikh stood undeterred, building a half-century partnership with Anil Sah to bring some much-needed relief to the Nepali innings. Sah scored 27 runs, which featured three boundaries and a six, before being caught by Marco Jansen off Aiden Markram.Just as the innings were steadying for the Rhinos, Shamsi struck again, proving a thorn in Nepal’s flesh. Nepal were in need of 18 runs off as many deliveries at the end of 16 overs when they dealt a massive blow, losing Dipendra Singh Airee (6), Aasif Sheikh (42) and Kushal Malla (1) in a span of five balls.Tension ran high as Nepal were still in need of eight runs with an over to spare. Gulshan Jha, who took to the field at number seven, missed twice, narrowing the game down to eight runs with four deliveries in hand.Jha then smashed a boundary. The game was down to two runs off as many balls, but he missed again. With only a single delivery remaining, Jha and his partner Sompal Kami made the run for an equaliser, but the former was run out, ending Nepal’s hopes of competing in the World Cup.For South Africa, Tabraiz Shamsi grabbed four wickets while Aiden Markram also dismissed a Nepali batter. \nNepal restricted South Africa to a lowly total of 115 runs in Group D match of the 2024 ICC Men’s T20 World Cup being held at the Arnos Vale Ground, West Indies.Sent to bat first, the Group D leaders struggled to put points together as Nepal’s Kushal Bhurtel and Dipendra Singh Airee shone with the ball.Opener Quinton de Kock managed to put 10 tuns off 11 balls before being dismissed by Airee in 3.4 overs.Bhurtel then picked out South Africa captain Aiden Markram for a 22-ball 15 in 11.2 overs, and had Heinrich Klaasen caught by Karan KC for a cheap three shortly after.Kock’s opening partner Reeza Hendricks stood his ground, smashing five hits to the fences and a maximum, accumulating 43 runs, highest of the innings, before being sent to the pavillion by Airee in 15.3 overs.Tristan Stubbs was the only other South African batter to score in double digits, putting an unbeaten 27 in his 18-knock play.Bhurtel claimed four wickets in his four-0ver spell, giving away just 19 runs. Similarly, Airee also bowled four overs, grabbing three wickets and conceding 21 runs.South Africa have already reached the Super Eight stage after heavy rain in Florida led to the abandonment of the Nepal-Sri Lanka match on June 11.Nepal lost to the Netherlands in their opening game and sit in the fourth position with one point. But they still have a chance to progress to the Super Eight if they win both of their remaining matches—against South Africa and Bangladesh. \nNepal can finally breathe a sigh of relief and will have at least something to cheer for when they return home from Saudi Arabia—thanks to a spirited battle against a strong Yemen.The Gorkhalis headed into their last Group H game of the second round of the 2026 FIFA World Cup and 2027 AFC Asian Cup Qualifiers against Yemen on Tuesday low in confidence after losing all of their previous five matches, with their most recent embarrassment coming in a 4-0 drubbing by group winners United Arab Emirates last week.Vincenzo Alberto Annese’s men had conceded 18 goals in five qualifiers matches, scoring none in reply.Nepal’s dismal qualifiers campaign was also partly contributed by the sheer negligence of sports authorities All Nepal Football Association (ANFA) and National Sports Council whose poor management of the country’s only international standard football venue—Dasharath Stadium—forced Nepal to play their two home matches at neutral venues.However, on Tuesday, they floored Yemen with a dogged fightback until the death after initially falling behind to a ninth minute Nasser Al Gahwashi penalty at the Prince Mohammad bin Fahd Stadium in Dammam, thanks to Sanjeeb Bista and Gillespye Jung Karki whose goals either side of the half time turned things around for Nepal.Although Mohammed Al Dahi’s equaliser in the first minute of stoppage time denied them a first victory of the qualifiers and also a first win against Yemen, their dogged display will still serve as a testament that the youth Nepali squad have a lot of potential.The draw against Yemen will especially wash the burden off the Italian coach Annese whose contract with Nepal is expiring this month.Annese, who was appointed as Nepal head coach in March last year, has been under a sharp knife following a series of disappointing results that also included a draw against minnows Bhutan, disappointing SAFF Championship campaign and World Cup Qualifiers first round struggles against Laos.The 39-year-old coach has been using the exodus of Nepali football stars including Bimal Gharti Magar and Sujal Shrestha to Australia and an inexperienced squad as his defence for Nepal’s poor run of results in the international arena.But he seems to have finally cracked the code in his probably last game with Nepal as coach. And the output against Yemen could possibly convince ANFA to trigger another extension in his contract. ANFA had added a three-month extension in Annese’s contract this year.The emergence of Sanjeeb, who only made his international debut in March this year as an 88th minute substitute during a 5-0 qualifiers loss to Bahrain, is even more promising.Sanjeeb, who played full 90 minutes in Nepal’s 3-0 loss against Bahrain before being benched in 4-0 defeat to the UAE, had a hand in both of Nepal’s goals against Yemen in Dammam.Sanjeeb, who replaced star forward Anjan Bista in the front, first pounced on a misplaced back pass from Radhawan Al Hubaishi and bent the ball past Yemen goalkeeper Mohammed Khairalah to score an equaliser in the 22nd minute.Sanjeeb then received a long pass from Chhiring Lama and served it for Karki to head home Nepal’s second goal in the 66th.It was the first international goals for both Sanjeeb and Karki. Karki made his debut for Nepal in September last year during Nepal’s goalless draw with Myanmar. The evening was also memorable for Nepal captain Kiran Kumar Limbu. Playing his 100th international match, the 34-year-old goalkeeper produced a string of stunning saves to keep Yemen at bay till the final moments and helped Nepal earn a point.Even though Nepal failed to reach the third round of the FIFA World Cup Qualifiers and could not directly qualify for the 2027 Asian Cup, they still have a chance to secure their spot in their maiden Asian Cup through Asian Cup Qualification which will be played between March 25, 2025 to March 31, 2026.Top two teams from each nine groups qualified for the third round of 2026 FIFA World Cup and also secured a direct berth to the 2027 AFC Asian Cup. Qatar, Kuwait, Japan, North Korea, South Korea, China, Oman, Kyrgyzstan, Iran, Uzbekistan, Iraq, Indonesia, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, UAE, Bahrain, Australia and Palestine progressed.The 18 nations who failed to advance (India, Afghanistan, Syria, Myanmar, Thailand, Singapore, Malaysia, Chinese Taipei, Turkmenistan, Hong Kong, Vietnam, Philippines, Tajikistan, Pakistan, Yemen, Nepal, Lebanon and Bangladesh) will compete in the 24-team AFC Asian Cup Qualifiers, with only six teams making it to the Asian Cup finals.Bhutan, the Maldives and Laos will join them in the third round of Asian Cup Qualification as the best ranking losing teams of the first round. The winners of the Asian Cup Qualifiers playoffs between Sri Lanka and Cambodia, Timor-Leste and Mongolia and Brunei Darussalam and Macau will also be in the competition. \nUS President Joe Biden could soon announce a new effort to allow immigrants in the US illegally to obtain legal status if they are married to US citizens, three sources said, an election-year move that could energize some liberal voters.Biden is expected to unveil the effort as soon as Tuesday at a White House event, two of the sources said, requesting anonymity to discuss internal plans still subject to change.Biden, a Democrat, is seeking a second term in the November 5 election that will pit him against Republican challenger Donald Trump, an immigration hardliner.Biden has grappled with record numbers of migrants caught crossing the US-Mexico border illegally on his watch and recently rolled out a restrictive new asylum ban at the border to deter crossers.Some fellow Democrats and immigrant advocates opposed the asylum ban and have called on Biden to protect long-term US residents who lack legal status, including spouses.Reuters reported in April that the White House was considering ways to allow the spouses to obtain legal status.White House spokesperson Angelo Fernandez Hernandez did not confirm any coming immigration relief, but said in a statement that Biden officials “remain committed to taking action to address our broken immigration system.”Biden said in June 4 remarks on the asylum ban that in coming weeks he would “speak to how we can make our immigration system more fair and more just.”Tuesday’s White House event will be tied to the anniversary of the 2012 Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program.The DACA program was launched by former President Barack Obama and then-Vice President Biden and currently grants deportation relief and work permits to 528,000 people brought to the US as children.The US State Department also could roll out new guidance that says DACA recipients should be presumed eligible for non-immigrant visas if they leave the US, one of the sources said.Representative Nanette Barragan, a Democrat and head of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, said she would attend the White House event and urged Biden to take action to protect spouses of US. citizens and DACA recipients.Barragan said in an interview that Biden could contrast himself with Trump, who has vowed to launch the largest deportation effort in US history.“I think it could be significant for the lives of these people who are living in the shadows, who are married to American citizens and who are under threat of being removed from the country,” she said.An estimated 1.1 million immigrants in the US illegally are married to US citizens, according to data by advocacy organization FWD.us, but how many of those would be included in a possible Biden action remained unclear. \nSenior officials of South Korea and the United States held an emergency phone call over a possible impending visit by Russian President Vladimir Putin to North Korea, Seoul’s foreign ministry said on Friday.South Korea’s vice foreign minister, Kim Hong-kyun, in the phone call with US Deputy Secretary of State Kurt Campbell, said that Putin’s visit should not result in deeper military cooperation between Pyongyang and Moscow in violation of UN Security Council resolutions, the ministry said.Echoing Kim’s concerns, Campbell pledged continued cooperation to tackle potential regional instability and challenges caused by the trip.‘While closely monitoring related developments, the two sides agreed to resolutely respond through airtight cooperation to North Korea’s provocations against South Korea and actions that escalate tensions in the region,” the ministry said in a statement.On Wednesday, a senior official at Seoul’s presidential office said Putin was expected to visit North Korea “in the coming days”. Russia’s Vedomosti newspaper on Monday reported Putin would visit North Korea and Vietnam in the coming weeks.Civilian aircraft have been cleared from Pyongyang’s airport and there are signs of preparations for a possible parade in the capital’s Kim Il Sung Square, NK PRO, a Seoul-based website, reported this week, citing commercial satellite imagery.When Sergei Shoigu, then Russia’s defence minister, visited Pyongyang last year to jumpstart the two countries’ warming ties, he accompanied Kim to a parade and saluted as North Korea’s banned nuclear-tipped missiles rolled by.Speaking at the Stimson Center think tank in Washington on Wednesday, Campbell said the United States has a very good understanding of what North Korea has provided Russia, which he said has had “a substantial impact on the battlefield”.Less clear, he said, is what Russia has provided North Korea.“Hard currency? Is it energy? Is it capabilities that allow them to advance their nuclear or missile products? We don’t know. But we’re concerned by that and watching carefully,” he said. \nNepal's book market is rife with unauthorized translations, violating the rights of authors like Taslima Nasrin and leading to concerns over quality and the tarnishing of the country's reputation in the global market.\nBharat Budha, chair of Putha Uttarganga Rural Municipality’s ward 10, knows that many youths from his village have made it to the United States via ‘tallo bato’—backdoor route—and that many are still on the way. He also knows that eight of them have been deported from the country and that they have lost a cumulative Rs45 million in the process. The deported youths say that they returned home empty-handed after facing unspeakable ordeals and lost Rs6 million each on average.The Tak village in Rukum East—a close-knit settlement of 425 houses—was considered the Maoists’ ‘base area’ during the insurgency. Village youths who reached the US through illegal routes and got deported have lost an estimated Rs40 million. The number of those who returned without completing the journey and the amount they lost remain unknown.To get to the US, the youths have taken loans at up to 36 percent interest per annum from their relatives and village landowners. In Tak village, at least one person each from half of the households has gone abroad, Budha said. “Youths started going to America about six-seven years ago,” he said. “If they could gather enough money, the whole village would try to go to the US.” Budha’s own son had reached the US illegally in 2017, spending Rs3.2 million.During the insurgency, outsize slogans of revolution would adorn the walls of houses in the village. Hoping for a better life, people from all walks of life helped out the Maoists. But now, village youths are paying the agents to illegally get to the US—a country that the Maoists used to call their ‘enemy’, an ‘imperialistic force’. This has cost the Tak village much and in multiple ways.Death of a dreamSome of the deported youths have chosen to flee the village altogether, burdened with debt and creditors’ pressure. At least five such families have already left, said a resident. The family of Ram Budha was one of them. On April 28, 2015, Ram, who had returned to Nepal after working in Malaysia for eight years, took the illegal route to the US. He travelled through arduous trails for months and finally arrived in the country. Upon reaching the country, he was detained and had to stay at the detention camp for 27 months. When his refugee application was rejected, he was deported to Nepal in mid-December 2019. He lost Rs4.5 million in the process. He now owes over Rs6 million to creditors. “After the creditors began to put pressure on me, I couldn’t live in the village peacefully,” said Ram, who currently runs a vegetable farm in Tarakeshwar, Kathmandu.While those who got to the US through illegal routes and fortunately got refugee status there narrate their stories with pride, those who have been deported or returned from half-way have tragic tales to tell.Nanda Kala Gharti, who lives in a small stone house on the upper flank of Tak village, spends her days in melancholy. Her husband, Dhanlal, had chosen to take the illegal route to the US, and Nanda Kala, a mother of four, is living with the repercussions of his decision. Dhanlal had got into the US after a six-month long arduous journey and was detained immediately. He had to spend four years in the detention camp, before he was deported to Nepal. He had already lost Rs6 million.Nanda Kala said they now have an insurmountable crisis in their hands. Pointing to her son, she exclaimed, “When will he grow up, go abroad and pay back the loans!”Dhanlal himself tried to go to Croatia once and spent 15 days in Kathmandu for the process. But after he was turned down, he returned home dejected. “Now we will submit the passport to another agent [for Dhanlal’s trip abroad],” Nanda Kala said. “There’s no point staying here.”Stories that echo each otherThe situation in Sisne Rural Municipality is similar to that of Putha Uttarganga. Here, one can hear plenty of stories of those who have tried to go to the US and those who are fighting refugee cases there. Krishna Regmi, chair of the rural municipality, personally knows seven people who have been deported from the US.Gangaram Khadka, a resident of Sisne-3, runs a bee and chicken farm. Like other young men in his village, Khadka had headed off to the US via an illegal route on 27 March, 2018. He had reached the US via the New Delhi-Moscow-Barcelona-Bogota-Panama-Costa Rica-Nicaragua-Honduras-Guatemala-Mexico route. When he finally arrived in the US, he was detained and had to spend 11 months in detention. He was deported on 15 March, 2019. He had handed over Rs3.2 millions to the agent and spent Rs2 million to fight the case to become a refugee. “It’s not possible for me to pay back the loan while working in Nepal,” he said. “I aim to pay back some interest and head off abroad again.”For six months after Khadka was deported, he had anxiety and headache, he said, adding the three people from his village who were deported like him are also struggling with their mental health.Tikaram Pun, a 40-year-old resident of Bohora village in Musikot-4, is also haunted by his past journey. In September 2017, he reached the US after crossing 17 countries with the help of organised human traffickers. Of the 41 people in his group, 31 were from Rukum East and Rukum West, he said. Pun, who was detained on arrival in the US, spent 24 months in a detention camp. His refugee application was also refused and so he was deported along with eight other Nepalis. “When I returned, I started having mental health problems. I still suffer from them,” he said. Pun is under pressure from creditors and relatives to pay back the Rs9.2 million loan he had taken for the task.Those who died on the wayA group of 10 Bangladeshis and seven Nepalis, including Rupak Bohora of Bafikot-3 in Rukum West, were on a mission to reach Costa Rica through Colombia, Caribbean Coast, Capuragana and Panama. But while they were crossing a sea, their boat capsized. As many as 12 died in the incident, including six Nepalis. Rupak’s wife, Geeta, learned about the incident only after six days, on 25 June, 2021.“I still don’t know what exactly happened,” said Geeta, who had been married off at age 19 and is now a mother of two daughters. The only thing she knows is that Rupak has died and she is now all alone. And that she has Rs5 million in loan taken for Rupak’s trip. She showed a picture of her husband on her phone to this scribe and said, “I only have memories.”Lack of political will and legal remediesThe concrete bridge over Chewang river is on the edge of Tak village. On the walls of the bridge are paintings of political theorists like Marx, Engels, Lenin, Stalin and Mao, and the iconic slogan, ‘Workers of the world, unite!’, below them. But the slogan appears to be at odds with life in the village. Given the phenomenon of illegal travels to the US through the help of organised human traffickers, the whole village appears to be emptying. Neither the local governments are concerned about the phenomenon nor are the political parties paying attention.Puniraj Gharti, chair of Putha Uttarganga Rural Municipality, said though the trend is worrying, there’s nothing he can do. “How could we stop them from making the trip when they are struggling to make a living in the village?” he said.Krishna Regmi, chair of Sisne Rural Municipality, said that the vicious cycle of poverty started after marijuana farming was banned in the country. Then the Maoist insurgency added to the woe, forcing youths to migrate. The signing of the peace agreement in 2006 didn’t herald any change in the economy either and youths are struggling to get jobs. Organised human traffickers are cashing in on this sorry state of affairs, Regmi said. “Meter byajis [usurious lenders] are also promoting this phenomenon,” he added.The phenomenon is equally rife in Dang’s Tulsipur and Ghorahi. Ramesh Kumar Pandey, chair of Ghorai-15, says that even though many heading to the US are swindled, no complaints are filed at the ward office. “Only those who attempt to go to Saudi Arabia or Qatar file the complaints,” he said.One can infer from Pandey’s statements that the families of such illegal travellers don’t want to publicise the ordeals of their family members. On the one hand, agents threaten them to not publicise the issue; on the other, they fear they themselves would be punished by law.According to the Anti-Human Trafficking Bureau, as many as 178 Nepalis, including 174 men, have been deported from the US in the five fiscal years after 2018-19. Of them, the highest 49 are from Rukum while 37 are from Dang. The data doesn’t include those who returned after making it to the half-way or those who have been fighting the legal battle in the US for refugee status. But this data is enough to show that many such youths are from the ‘base areas’ of the Maoist insurgency.SSP Jeevan Shrestha, chief of the bureau, said that data on the number of such victims and the amounts they have spent is hard to collect since complaints are rarely filed with the police. “This is human trafficking but for a lack of law, we are still compelled to launch the cases as per Human Trafficking and Transportation (Control) Act 2074 BS,” Shrestha said. “The Act provides a maximum penalty of Rs250,000 for the offenders and 50 percent of that as compensation to the victims.” Without specific law, police also invoke the theft and organised crime act to punish the offenders, he added.On the one hand, police receive no complaints; on the other, the phenomenon sees no control.Bhaskar Gautam, a political scientist, says the rise in cases of human trafficking in the insurgency’s ‘base areas’ is due to the political system’s abject failure.While the Maoists raised issues related to livelihood, nationalism and a new kind of democracy to fuel their war machine, after the peace process, it is livelihoods that have been hit the hardest, Gautam said. “The traditional way of life and economy took a hit during the insurgency,” he said. “Developments after the peace process also failed to address that. What sprang up was organised human trafficking.”(Mahesh KC in Rukum East and Durgalal KC in Dang contributed to this report.)This report is prepared in collaboration with the Center for Investigative Journalism-Nepal. \nHospitals in Pokhara, Chitwan, Biratnagar, and Butwal brazenly disregard government regulations mandating free treatment for underprivileged patients, denying access to essential healthcare due to regulatory failures and lack of enforcement.\nThe Nepali cricket team’s second-ever T20 World Cup should have been a moment of joy but has turned into a dark crisis. But first, some introductions.Ever since I can remember, playing and watching cricket have been important parts of my identity. I have followed with joy the rise of Nepali cricket over the last 20 years. I am what you might call a fanatic. I never miss any Nepal match if I can help it, be it a friendly with a local club in India, a crunch qualifier against one of our nemesis associate nations, or a World Cup match against a Test nation. It does not matter what time zone a match is being played or where I am. I have also followed Sandeep Lamichhane’s career closely. He put Nepali cricket on the international map, and whether he played for the national team or some local T20 franchise, I tried to find a working link to be able to watch him play.I am establishing these credentials first because I expect fellow passionate Nepali cricket fans will rush to dismiss what comes next. But I want you to know that I love Nepali cricket just as much as you do, and so this is not part of some conspiracy to discredit Sandeep or Nepali cricket. Quite the opposite: I care about Nepali cricket too much to stay silent. At a time when populist stunts are rife, it feels necessary to speak truth to power, as an expression of love. Custodians of rape cultureMuch has been written about Sandeep’s Gaushala-26 rape case. As a rule of thumb, I choose to believe victims. The harassment she has faced—which culminated in her suicide attempt—beggars belief. She has remained steadfast against all pressure, rejecting advances to “settle” the case. It is hard to imagine why else anyone would willingly subject themselves to such inhumane treatment. This reflection, though, is not just about whether Sandeep raped Gaushala-26. My focus here is to examine Sandeep’s case as a textbook example of how our institutions perpetuate rape culture, where sexual abuse and violence are normalised. Custodian 1: The fansEver since Sandeep has been accused, the vast majority of his fans have taken to social media to defend him, as well as to defame the victim. Perhaps it is no surprise in a deeply patriarchal society in the grips of populism, where hero worship has taken new heights. Sandeep is a hero to many, and apparently he can do no wrong. Or, even if he wrongs, he is still above the law because he can bowl a mean googly, and that’s what matters. These fans- mostly but not exclusively young men- are vocal in their support for Sandeep. Even when he was a convicted felon, never mind when he was just accused of being a rapist- that too potentially of a minor- cricket mattered more to his devotees. Such craze toward their favourite cricketer substantially sustained a rape culture where allegations of sexual abuse were relegated to oblivion. When an overwhelming, assertive, visible, and vitriolic population aggressively downplays rape charges, it extinguishes any hope victims might have in their elusive quest for justice. Custodian 2: The courtsEvery level of the court system has already weighed in on Sandeep’s case. The Supreme Court—in its infinite wisdom—allowed him to represent the national team and travel abroad while on trial for rape charges. Along with the Prime Minister, who found it fitting to felicitate Sandeep in the middle of his trial, the Supreme Court’s tacit endorsement of Sandeep has made a mockery of victims’ rights and cemented rape culture as the established norm in Nepal. The Kathmandu District Court was at least bold enough to convict Sandeep of rape, though it did not find the victim to be a minor, which would have led to more significant consequences for Sandeep. Knowledge sources had commented then that this was already paving the way for a successful appeal later, which soon came to pass. The High Court overturned that conviction, acquitting Sandeep of all charges. Almost instantaneously, the fans came out in droves and celebrated that decision. Social media is swarmed with comments about how if Sandeep was punished when convicted, he should be reinstated immediately now that he is acquitted. It is an open secret that the judiciary- like many other institutions in Nepal- is compromised. Power and privilege run deep, and decisions are not just made on the merits of the legal argument. To all the fans now celebrating Sandeep’s acquittal and making that the basis for his rehabilitation, I have just one question: If you are from a poor family and if your loved one is sexually assaulted by someone rich, powerful, or politically connected, do you genuinely expect our judicial system to impart justice and punish the perpetrator? Take a moment, put yourself in the shoes of Gaushala-26’s family, and reflect on this question. If you honestly believe that justice would be served, I have a bridge to sell you.Custodian 3: CAN and the cricketing fraternityThe Cricket Association of Nepal (CAN) has towed a fine line, appearing to uphold the law in the strictest sense. As soon as Sandeep was convicted, CAN suspended him from all cricketing activities. He was only reinstated after he was acquitted by the High Court. Dig a bit deeper though, and rape culture rears its ugly head. Even while facing serious rape charges, CAN was not compelled by any sense of morality to prevent him from representing Nepal. Within moments of the High Court’s acquittal, CAN officials rushed to announce that Sandeep had been reinstated. They went above and beyond to lobby the US Embassy to grant him a visa on time. When that failed, they facilitated his travel to St. Vincent and the Grenadines for him to play the remaining matches. They have lobbied the International Cricket Council to ensure his inclusion while sacrificing another player from the squad. To be sure, CAN has faced incredible scrutiny and received intense pressure from “the fans” to back Sandeep. Yet, the rush to not only rehabilitate but actually elevate Sandeep demonstrates that CAN only saw the case as a nuisance. Even if the legal burden of proof might not have been met, CAN could and should have investigated whether Sandeep met the national team’s code of conduct, as has been customary in similar cases around the world. It should have taken time to study the decision, and it could have waited for the legal process to reach its logical conclusion; it is all but certain that a Supreme Court appeal will follow. What CAN has not done speaks volumes of how rape culture is sustained in Nepal. To my knowledge, no official has spoken publicly about whether Sandeep’s actions violated the expectations placed on national players, or expressed concern or solidarity for the victim. The reasons for Sandeep’s absence have been conveniently ignored, as if he has simply been on holiday or nursing a minor injury. Just as his absence was unexplained, so too has his return been left ‘unsaid’. The gaslighting of the entire saga shows the contempt with which the issue is treated in Nepal. The wider cricketing fraternity—which includes players, former players, coaches, commentators, sponsors, and officials—has, at best, adopted a veil of silence or, at worst, come out publicly in Sandeep’s support. Respected national and international commentators have found it convenient to use phrases such as “Sandeep is not available” when away and “Sandeep, the talisman of Nepali cricket, is back” now, without any mention of the dark context. A moment to engage with and educate a whole nation on how to take rape charges, and its victim, seriously has been left unaddressed. Because, of course, cricket comes first. A naïve hopeI expect the backlash to this piece to be swift and severe. It feels poignant that I am travelling to watch Nepal play in the World Cup in the very matches Sandeep will now play. But his celebrated return has filled me with dread, anxiety, and disgust, to the point that I do not know how to support my beloved team anymore. Spare a thought for Gaushala-26 and for all victims of rape and rape culture. Regardless of the legalese, we must strive to build a culture where victims are empowered and supported to speak up and stand for the truth. Nepali cricket has always found a way through adversity, often miraculously. Our obsession with star power must be replaced with a focus on the role cricket, and citizens, should play in sustaining a culture of accountability and respect for victims. As amazing as it is, cricket is still only a game and must become a vehicle for good, not evil.  \nAmidst ongoing atrocities in Ukraine, Sudan, Israel, and Gaza, the international community emphasizes criminal prosecutions for justice, but this approach risks oversimplifying victims' rights and neglecting holistic responses such as transitional justice measures that prioritize their needs and context-specific reparations.\nTorrential rains mark the onset of Asar, signifying a surge in last-minute capital spending, known as 'Asarey Vikas,' characterized by hasty and substandard road construction due to government and contractor urgency to meet financial deadlines.\nWhen it arrives, it can bring both bounty and bane. However, due to a changing climate, monsoons in recent times have invariably resulted in more hardship than help. This monsoon, which arrived in Nepal on Monday, three days ahead of the usual date, will certainly buoy farmers and provide much-needed relief from the blistering heat, but concerns over its severity still loom large. Experts have predicted above-normal rains and above-average maximum and minimum temperatures. As this will exacerbate floods, landslides and epidemics, disaster preparedness becomes crucial.Our responses to natural disasters have consistently fallen short. Governments come and go, but the same pattern repeats every year, and hundreds of lives, and a whole lot of properties and physical infrastructure are left at nature’s mercy. Not that the country has no plans and policies for disaster preparedness. This year, as in previous ones, the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Authority has devised the Monsoon Preparedness and Response Plan, which is commendable. The necessary logistics and emergency relief materials have also been stockpiled in all provinces, according to officials. The problem, however, is with the execution of these plans. This monsoon is estimated to put 1.81 million people and 412,000 households at risk, and require 18,000 rescues. These numbers are large, suggesting the necessity for a comprehensive response to disasters and ensuring that relief programmes reach the most vulnerable and needy. Lack of effective coordination between federal, provincial and local levels has also caused several problems during disasters. Local governments play a big role as primary rescuers in floods and landslides, but they are still far short in human and financial resources. The examples from the earthquake-devastated Rukum West, Sindhupalchowk and several other places highlight how Nepal fails to rehabilitate the disaster-displaced people for long periods. The residents of Rukum West are still obliged to live in houses with cracks and fissures, and experts warn that these houses could be badly damaged this monsoon. There is also high risk to those living in high landslide and flood prone areas. Unless we design approaches that include not only immediate relief programmes but also year-round relocation, rehabilitation, monitoring and study, people will continue to suffer. Also, proactive measures like public awareness and early warning should be strengthened.Moreover, monsoons are notorious for water- and vector-borne diseases, including dengue, cholera and typhoid. Dengue cases are already being reported from different parts of the country and the caseload will likely increase during and after the monsoon. Water resource contamination has surged in the past few months, leading to a higher number of water-borne disease cases in hospitals. During the monsoon preparedness, the authorities shouldn’t overlook these epidemics and focus particularly on areas that are more prone to diseases and, therefore, need timely healthcare intervention and workers.A coordinated effort from health, home, urban development and water supply ministries can help make this monsoon a lot safer. In the long run, we should find ways to mitigate the effects of climate change, which has exacerbated our climatic conditions and intensified disasters. Understanding the impact of climate change and human activities on weather will help us better prepare for future monsoons and the disasters that come in their wake.  \nThe Janata Samajbadi Party-Nepal inaugurated its second general convention on Monday. The Upendra Yadav-led party is holding the mega event at a time the party has suffered multiple setbacks. Seven of its 12 federal lawmakers split the JSP-Nepal and registered a new outfit—Janata Samajbadi Party—at the Election Commission last month. The party of Upendra Yadav, who headed the party that had continuously led Madhesh provincial government since 2018, has been pushed to the opposition bench in the provincial assembly. Yadav, who was deputy prime minister and health minister in the Pushpa Kamal Dahal-led Cabinet until last month, has been ousted from the federal government as well. Despite such adverse circumstances, Yadav is poised to be the party chief again, most likely unopposed.Yadav rose to power after successfully spearheading a Madhesh movement in 2007 demanding rights for the historically marginalised Madheshi people. Though the demand for federalism had been raised by various quarters even in the past, it was Yadav-led agitation that eventually forced the Nepali state to introduce the federal system in the country. He formed Madheshi Janadhikar Forum-Nepal under his own leadership. Since then he has always been at the helm of a party. He has merged his party with various outfits, multiple times, only to split again.With the rise of Madheshi parties in the aftermath of the second people’s movement in 2006, people—not only from the southern belt of the country but also from most marginalised communities—had high hopes for a paradigm shift in Nepali politics. The big parties traditionally holding power, namely the Nepali Congress and the CPN-UML, had felt pressure. But within years of their joining governments in Kathmandu, people were disenchanted by their performance. A section of people expected that the regional parties would do better when allowed to lead provincial governments. They failed in the province as well.In Nepal, communist leaders and parties have been infamous for persistent disputes and divisions, mostly after the 1990 political change. When parties mushroomed in Madhesh, they beat the communists in terms of infightings and divisions. There is not a single party in Madhesh that remained intact, which is disappointing for those who expected that regional forces would build pressure on traditional forces through better delivery.Mismanagement, lack of organisational discipline, non-transparency and top leaders’ monopoly in decision-making have become common traits of Madhesh-based parties. Big parties such as the Congress, the UML and the Maoist Centre are criticised for being monopolistic and rather undemocratic. But, newer forces proved themselves worse. For instance, at least the big parties have been holding their general conventions as per the constitutional provision. Their provincial, district and village units are also elected through a process. For example, the UML is now electing its district leaders through conventions. When they fail to pick leaders in consensus, they readily go for a vote. Top leaders may favour those loyal to them but even these loyalists must nonetheless follow the process. That is why the UML is considered the most organised party in the country. The Congress also follows at least basic democratic norms while electing its leaders and making important decisions. But we don’t see the same in Madhesh-based and other newly emerged forces. This is unfortunate. Only political parties that are well-organised, democratic and transparent in their activities will have the moral strength to mount pressure on big forces. Those who can’t maintain democracy and transparency in their own organisations can’t ensure it in the government when they come to power. We hardly find any leader in Madhesh handing over party leadership to other leaders through a democratic process. We hope that in the ongoing convention Yadav’s JSP-Nepal can bring policies to make the party organisation more transparent and democratic. \nAmbassadors aren’t magicians. No matter how good their PR skills are, it takes time and effort to cultivate good working relations with the officials of their host countries. When a country constantly chops and changes its ambassadors, diplomacy becomes difficult. Nepali political parties have a wretched record of abruptly recalling ambassadors appointed by the previous coalition governments. But Thursday's silly recall of Dr Shankar Sharma, Nepali ambassador to India, must be the most egregious of them all. The Cabinet decided to recall Sharma days ahead of Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal’s New Delhi visit to attend the third swearing-in of Narendra Modi as India’s prime minister. Why couldn’t Dahal have waited until he got back from New Delhi? With what authority would an ambassador that his prime minister clearly does not trust coordinate his India trip? Why the rush, one wonders. Of course, it is natural for a new government to want to appoint those it can rely on as the country’s envoys. But then our envoys are Nepal’s representatives abroad, whose conduct can make or break the country’s image. This is why only the most capable of them should make the cut. And if the best of the best are chosen, they should be allowed to work for the four full years. This time, the government has recalled not just its Indian ambassador but also its envoys from 10 other countries, including the US and the UK. Notably, these envoys were appointed by the same prime minister before he changed his main coalition partner, from the Nepali Congress to the CPN-UML. This is unfortunate. Political instability has had a devastating impact on Nepali economy as it now struggles to achieve even a modest 4 percent annual growth. It has destroyed our domestic institutions. The same instability is now also affecting our standing abroad. If Nepal’s major political actors cannot send a message of unity and purpose to the rest of the world, how will others trust us? Why would they come and invest in Nepal?Our relations with major powers like India and the US are not things to be trifled with, at a time of heightened geopolitical competition in the region. In these contested times, the only way Nepal can safely navigate the choppy geopolitical waters is through mature diplomacy. Appoint the right people in the right capitals and give them a free hand. What is particularly strange about the most recent recall of 11 ambassadors is that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs seems to have been bypassed, as the decision was apparently made against the advice of Foreign Minister Narayan Kaji Shrestha. This is not the first time that the advice of the foreign ministry has been sidelined. The diplomatic code of conduct is widely ignored and the ministry continues to be kept out of the loop as our top leaders engage with their foreign counterparts. Again, even if the ambassadors are to be appointed on political quotas (which they ideally should not), there can be a political understanding to pick the best of the lot and to let them serve out their term. Unless that happens, political instability at home will continue to harm Nepal's foreign conduct, with grave consequences for the Nepali national interest.  \nPrithvi Subba Gurung, deputy general secretary of the CPN-UML, is one of the leaders who strongly lobbied for a federal system while the Constituent Assembly was writing the constitution between 2008 to 2015. Eight years after the adoption of the federal democratic republican constitution, the federal system, particularly the provinces, are widely being criticised for their supposed failure to deliver. The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal asks former Gandaki chief minister Gurung what went wrong in the course of implementing the federal system.The implementation of the federal system has faced several hurdles since its adoption. Most provinces have for months failed even to form the governments, let alone run them efficiently. Where is the problem?We have adopted a federal system but are working against its spirit. Provinces should run autonomously. On some key issues, federal leaders and the party’s central bodies may give some direction to their provincial bodies. But most provincial activities are still centrally-governed even years after the adoption of federalism. So, our practices aren’t in line with the system. The provincial governments shouldn’t have been affected by the changes in the federal coalition. Such problems were seen in India years ago. But they have learned from their experience. In our case, leaders of major political parties treated the provincial governments as party chapters. The provincial governments are formed and run as per the constitution and all the three tiers of the governments are autonomous. The high commands in our political parties aren’t ready to accept the new constitutional setup.Are the provincial leaders equally responsible as they seek Kathmandu’s nod before taking any important decisions?They seek the centre’s support because they are trained in that way. They are too dependent on the centre. You said India learned by experience and now provinces there work more autonomously. But, in Nepal, provinces are now witnessing more problems than during their first tenure, which is evident also in the difficulties in government formation in multiple provinces. Why couldn’t they learn from the five-year experience?Nepal’s leaders and political parties are still not committed to federalism. They have failed to implement the federal system as per the spirit of the constitution. This is the major problem. The big parties as well as their leaders are guided by a centralised mindset and still prefer working in a unitary system. We should not forget that we transformed the executive and legislative bodies into three tiers of federal systems. But our judiciary retained the old structure. Therefore, the judiciary doesn’t accept the federal system and its practice in a true sense. Its verdicts reflect the same.The role of Speakers and Province Heads has courted controversies in multiple provinces. The top court invalidated some of their decisions. Is it because of lack of clarity, faults in our constitutional provisions, or is it because of the leaders?Speaker and Province Head are political posts created in accordance with constitutional provisions. When overall politics is dirty and unhealthy, those taking up these responsibilities also feel compelled to resort to similar tactics. When overall politics improves, they automatically make better decisions. Mainly there is no leader in the high command who completely owns federalism and is determined to implement it in its true spirit. This government in its policies and programmes unveiled last month had rightly said that “protecting federalism and strengthening the federal democratic republic is our top priority”. But the budget failed to introduce programmes as per the promises made in the policies and programmes.How do we correct these anomalies? Where do we begin?We are in a complex situation. Many have started to float the idea of making amendments to the constitution. But we shouldn’t forget that various forces and stakeholders had their own positions during constitution-making. They made compromises and found middle grounds to promulgate the constitution. If we go for amendments, they all will return to their respective stances. Some may want to revive the Hindu Kingdom while others will stand against it. Some leaders even within Nepali Congress have started to advocate for constitutional monarchy. But we can’t regress to the monarchical system. We can’t renounce secularism and an inclusive democratic system. We can’t backtrack on our commitment to a socialism-oriented system. We may explore some changes in our electoral system or form of governance without going against these key features of our constitution but we can’t destabilise the charter. What are the major flaws to be fixed?There are some. For instance, provinces have no role in education. The responsibility of education up to secondary level is given to the local level. And, everything is controlled by the federal government. The local units are entrusted with key responsibilities such as developing curriculum, overseeing the issues of career developments of teachers and staffers and their promotion as well as transfers etcetera. Local units can’t do all of these things efficiently as they have their own limitations. How can a local unit transfer a teacher from Kaski to Lamjung? Provinces should have been given such responsibilities. The power has been centralised at Singha Durbar. Such is also the situation in other sectors.Though the proportional representation (PR) system is hailed as one of the most beautiful features of our constitution in terms of ensuring inclusion, it has also been blamed for political instability. Many have demanded revision in the electoral system.The major political parties such as the CPN-UML and Nepali Congress have not trained their party members on the proper implementation of key constitutional features such as federalism and electoral system. The party members and general people have either wrongly understood it, or have negative impressions about the systems. These systems were adopted with an objective to resolve our decade-long conflict and address the concerns of the historically marginalised communities and even mainstream some groups through an inclusive democratic system. The idea was to integrate all the communities and maintain unity in diversity. After holding years-long debates on various options, we agreed on the mixed electoral system so as to reflect our diversity in the state agencies.As the proverb goes, “the bad workman blames his tools”, our leaders are blaming the system for their failure to secure a majority by winning people’s trust. Many countries that practise similar electoral systems have progressed. Our electoral system and the form of governance are not causing political instability. Many countries have adopted a parliamentary system and many others have practised the presidential model. Countries have progressed in both the systems. Also, there are examples of failures under both setups. So, the problem lies in our political parties and leaders, not in the systems. Shouldn’t political parties like the UML and Congress work with a plan to secure a majority by winning people’s trust? They aren’t training their focus on that but blaming the system. At times, they have squandered the majority as well and have failed to keep the party intact. Isn’t it our [leaders’] failure?Some argue that the issue of the fractured mandate can be addressed by increasing the threshold ceiling for political parties to be eligible to get PR votes and that can be done by amending election laws. Does it help?This is the idea coming from big political parties because they get more votes when fringe parties disqualify for PR votes. But a higher ceiling may deprive many small parties from representing certain communities. So, this goes against the spirit of inclusion. What we need is a good coalition culture. If we see the trend of recent decades, Indian politicians have become much more mature in this context. In the past, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi accommodated his electoral alliance partners in his ruling coalition even though his party won the majority single-handedly. If we scrap the inclusive electoral system, won’t the marginalised communities again revolt? We should be careful about that.At times, leaders have helped dissident groups split their party. These are the same leaders who issued an ordinance to change the provision that required a group within a political party to show support of 40 percent members of the party’s central committee “and” the parliamentary party. Only then could it split. They changed the threshold to 20 percent, and the “and” provision had been changed to “or”. The provision of requiring 40 percent support on both sides had earlier been included to ensure political stability. But the leaders who are helping party divisions are blaming the system for instability in the country. So, we [leaders] have to mend our ways, not blame the system. The Rastriya Swantantra Party, the fourth-largest in the lower house, has officially said that it wants to overhaul the federal system and drastically downsize the provinces. Also, leaders within the major parties who earlier stood in favour of federalism have started criticising it. On Saturday, Congress General Secretary Gagan Thapa said the country can’t sustain the provinces in their present form. What is your view?I am one of those who advocated for a federal system even before the first Constituent Assembly because Nepal is a country full of discrimination based on caste, class, region and religion. We advocated for the system to do away with these discriminations and find a system to maintain unity within diversity. Federalism is the best system to promote national unity as all groups get their own space as per their unique features. For instance, if you make multiple rooms in a building, you can give space and adjust more people. But if you keep many people inside a big room, they will have difficulties—no matter how big the room is. We should strengthen the federal system. We can’t regress.Then, why do many people see provinces as a burden?In Nepal, the federal system was projected as a structure that resulted in huge liability to the state coffers. But the facts don’t substantiate it. A local unit in the federal structure replaced many erstwhile Village Development Committees (VDCs). For instance, in my home district of Lamjung, eight palikas covered the areas of 61 VDCs, and the expenditure of the current eight local units is no more than that of the erstwhile 61 VDCs. Now we don’t need 77 district coordination committees. They can be scrapped. No province needs more than seven ministers. Likewise, the federal Cabinet can be drastically downsized. Why do we need a 25-strong Cabinet at the centre when we already have seven other provincial cabinets? Twelve ministries are enough at the centre, as suggested by the high level commission on administration reform.There are many departments and divisions that were designed under the unitary system that have become completely redundant in the federal setup. So many project offices established over two decades ago based on the needs of that time are still there. These irrelevant bodies should be scrapped. This is how we can significantly cut down on administrative costs. Leaders and people don’t discuss that. They only blame provinces. \nLawmaker Jiban Pariyar, a joint general secretary of the Nepali Congress, the main opposition, was a member of the four-member taskforce that prepared the terms of reference (ToR) of the parliamentary committee to probe the cooperative scam. The taskforce finalised it after a prolonged dispute over whether to categorically mention Deputy Prime Minister and Home Minister Rabi Lamichhane’s name while defining the committee’s jurisdiction. The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal talked to him about the ToR finalisation process and other aspects of the probe. It took weeks to finalise the ToR and jurisdiction of the parliamentary committee formed to probe the cooperative scam. How did you finally reach an agreement? I will give a brief context first. Cases of cooperative frauds had been made public even in the past. But this time, some groups and gangs were seen to be working in an organised way to embezzle billions of rupees deposited by common people. Some established people, including those active in politics, were found to be misusing the people’s hard-earned money. This issue was thus urgent and our party Nepali Congress raised it strongly in Parliament. We had raised this issue even when we were in the government [before March 4]. We had raised it with erstwhile home minister Narayankaji Shrestha in parliamentary committees and other platforms. We had talked to him about the involvement of lawmakers and other politicians in such scams.But the Congress raised this issue more strongly after the party quit the government.This is true, and for a good reason. We demanded a parliamentary committee to probe this issue after our party’s exit from the government because Rabi Lamichhane, someone linked with some big cooperative scams, became home minister. We raised this issue after he was allowed to lead the same ministry and police agencies that were supposed to be investigating the scams. Earlier, various agencies within Nepal Police and other government bodies were looking into the matter. Erstwhile home minister Shrestha had assured us of an independent and fair investigation. Lamichhane transferred police officials who were investigating the scams, and tried to protect cooperative operators involved in wrongdoing. Based on all these activities, we concluded that a parliamentary probe committee is a must and we firmly stood for the same. Initially, we raised this issue in Parliament without obstructing House proceedings but the government compelled us to disrupt the meetings after it refused to address our concerns. The prime minister tried to give Lamichhane a clean chit by saying that he was not involved in the cooperative scams. Also, the Nepal Police chief at a parliamentary committee meeting said that the home minister wasn’t under investigation as he had done nothing wrong. In the meantime, the attorney general issued a letter stating that no cooperative-related case was registered against Lamichhane. It became clear that the government agencies wouldn’t investigate the issue independently. Then, we raised the issue strongly and we even had to obstruct Parliament meetings. After the pressure, top leaders from the ruling as well as opposition parties agreed to form a parliamentary committee to investigate the matter. The leaders formed a task force led by Law, Justice and Parliamentary Affairs Minister Padam Giri and entrusted us with preparing the committee’s ToR and defining its jurisdiction.But at the task force meetings, members from the ruling parties lobbied to define the committee’s jurisdiction in a way that only allowed for investigation into the wrongdoings of cooperatives and their operators but not those involved in syphoning money from there through illegal means. They argued that only those who issued the loans should be made liable, not those who obtained it. Their intent was to protect Rabi Lamichhane. But I insisted that our duty is to find where the common people’s money has been spent or misused and then to return the money to the depositors. I insisted on investigating Lamichhane as various studies have shown his involvement in the misuse of depositors’ money.Then, we started exchanging written proposals. We exchanged and discussed many such proposals in writing. We insisted on mentioning the names of Lamichhane and the Gorkha Media Network—where Lamichhane and GB Rai invested tens of millions of cooperatives’ money—and ensuring that the depositors get their money back. After a long negotiation, members from the UML became a bit flexible. But the Rastriya Swatantra Party of Lamichhane continued to be rigid. Then, we finally agreed to mention the names of the cooperatives from where Lamichhane and his former colleagues had obtained money and to name Gorkha Media Network but not Lamichhane.But won’t keeping out the name of the sitting home minister create more confusion and disputes?There is no need to be confused. The ToR has stated the name of Gorkha Media Network, where Lamichhane and his team invested the money they got from the cooperatives, and the ToR’s Annex-2 has a list of cooperatives from where they obtained the money. It has also stated that “responsible officials of the company” involved in such transactions would also be investigated. Even other firms and individuals linked to the transactions will be probed. So there is no chance of keeping Lamichhane away from investigation. The committee’s jurisdiction defined in the ToR is clear on this.Will your party ask for Lamichhane’s resignation after the committee starts investigating him?Our party is yet to formally demand the home minister’s resignation. But questions have been raised about him in Parliament, in various public platforms and in the media. Also, the general public has raised this issue. He knows the committee will summon him for interrogation. A few months ago, when a minister [from Congress] was summoned by the Commission for Investigation of Abuse of Authority, Lamichhane was the one who strongly demanded the minister’s resignation in Parliament. He will soon face the parliamentary inquiry committee. Let’s see how he faces it. Leaders from ruling parties including the prime minister have accused the Congress of personally targeting Lamichhane after he refused to join a Congress-led coalition in which he was offered the prime ministerial position.Leaders from new parties should understand that political leaders engage in dialogue with all political forces. Some meetings are convened in a strategic way. This is natural in a democracy. Also, Lamichhane met with our party president. But they spread a rumour that our party president offered him the prime ministerial position. That’s not true. The argument that we targeted him after he refused to join our coalition is baseless. The Congress has officially decided that the probe committee can investigate any of our members suspected of wrongdoings. Has any other party made such a decision officially? We have also officially challenged the home minister to prove the allegations he labelled at our party leaders from Parliament’s rostrum. We have also challenged him to investigate and prove the charges.When the names of head and members of the parliamentary probe committee became public, many thought that the parties didn’t give due importance to the panel as they nominated relatively low-profile lawmakers. Why didn’t the parties choose powerful leaders to investigate a national crisis of this magnitude?This is a wrong perception. All members are federal parliamentarians. They shouldn’t be judged based on their personalities and profiles. The committee is powerful because it has a mandate from the House, and its jurisdiction and the ToR give it power. What we should carefully follow is their work. They can invite experts and specialists—such as chartered accountants, bankers, account specialists—if they require technical expertise during the investigation.Lamichhane himself is chair of the fourth-largest party, which has a decisive role in the ruling coalition. Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal and CPN-UML chair KP Sharma Oli had initially ruled out any need of investigation into the home minister. In this context, can the committee members freely conduct the investigation?I am confident that even the committee member from the RSP can’t defend his leader when the documents and facts show that the money was illegally released. How can other members protect him? I believe they will conduct the investigation independently and come up with a consensus report. Documents, facts and figures guide investigation. This isn’t like leaders giving statements on public platforms. We are not saying he must be proven guilty as the Congress has blamed him. He may prove to be innocent after investigation. We should accept if the evidence proves Lamichhane innocent. The bottom line is that the investigation should be fair. Many Congress leaders are also involved in cooperative scams and other corruption cases. So people suspect that leaders will eventually trade off and the probe panel will be only an eyewash.This investigation cannot be weakened under any pretext. I am saying this based on the documents and evidence I have studied. Also, the media and other stakeholders such as the study report of Pokhara Metropolitan City and the investigation report of Rupandehi District Police, among others, have already made ample evidence public. It’s not easy to acquit the guilty.What will Congress’ approach be if the committee, where ruling parties have a majority, fails to decide by consensus and members take decisions on a majority basis?In the seven-member panel, there are two members from our party and one from the Rastriya Prajatantra Party. If those from the ruling parties pushed for a wrong decision based on their majority, members from opposition parties will counter that and register their differing views. If such a situation arises they will be free to make the reality public and they can even bring out a different report.Was Congress under pressure to reach an agreement as there were reports that the government was preparing to unveil the budget through ordinance citing opposition’s House obstruction?We weren’t worried about that. In fact, the prime minister’s initiatives and his seriousness to end the House deadlock played a crucial role in helping us reach this agreement. \nAmnesty International’s Secretary General Agnès Callamard was in Nepal last week as a part of her first South Asian tour. During her four-day visit, she interacted with people from all walks of life, including the prime minister, in an attempt to gauge the human rights situation here. In this interview with Binod Ghimire of the Post, Callamard talked about the human rights situation in Nepal and the rest of the world. Excerpts: You have been travelling this part of the world, interacting with people. How do you evaluate the human rights situation here?Human rights are backsliding everywhere. It’s a global phenomenon. There is backsliding on civil and political rights, freedom of expression, press freedom and freedom of peaceful assembly. There is backsliding on women’s rights and non-discrimination on economic rights, and in terms of armed conflicts. The number of people dying in armed conflicts is increasing exponentially. We are in deep trouble as far as human rights protection is concerned. The South Asia region hasn’t been immune to the global trend.For my mission, I am visiting Sri Lanka and Nepal. In the two countries, we observe the shrinking of civic space and greater weaponisation of laws to curtail freedom of expression, particularly online. The digital laws are often overbroad and disproportionate. Banning TikTok in Nepal, for instance, is a disproportionate overbroad measure of the violation of international laws. We are observing a great deal of attacks in protests. The use of lethal force or disproportionate use of force by the police in response to even peaceful protests is increasing. There are incidents where protestors have died after the use of police force. There are issues of impunity for past crimes. A study by a European research centre shows that fewer people live in democracies worldwide in 2024 than in 1986. This is a complete U-turn. What do you see as the reasons for the backsliding? There are several factors that explain the backsliding. One could be growing restlessness and anxiety due to economic downturns. There was a severe financial crisis in 2008, and we didn't really recover from it. The inequalities within states and between states have increased in the last decade. We have seen a sharp increase in the wealth of the super-rich. On the other hand, the poor are getting poorer. This is feeding anger and creating fertile ground for populism. The authoritarian leaders are feeding on that particular ground. The backsliding is also linked to Covid that had a terrible impact on the economy and society. During Covid, the governments adopted different emergency measures but, in many cases, those measures were never lifted. In Europe, refugees, migrants and minorities are viewed as the reasons why the economy is not picking up and they are accused of stealing jobs. In every country, the minorities have been made the scapegoats. There is a resentment that democracy has not delivered for the people. The expectations are high, but the governments have failed to act accordingly. Therefore, the people are prepared to listen to the authoritarian leaders. By authoritarian leaders, I do not mean those who are in power by force but those who are democratically elected. They are elected by the people, but they practise authoritarianism once they get into power. In Nepal, the burning problem of authoritarianism has been reflected even in local politics. For instance, the mayor of Kathmandu has resorted to repeated attacks against street vendors and landless people. These are authoritarian moves. Such leaders target vulnerable groups who cannot protect themselves. You are in Nepal at a time the government has arrested the owner of the largest media house. How does Amnesty International look at this situation?We are very alarmed and upset. We call on the government to release him immediately. Even if the charges are valid, they certainly do not justify imprisoning him. Amnesty International believes that the use of those charges is politically motivated and is an attempt to stifle dissent. It is a response to the professional investigation and reporting about the policies and practices of those in power. This is an attempt to silence him, to silence the news media and to silence journalists. By so doing, the authorities are also violating the rights of the Nepali society to access information at a time when they need that kind of information. The attack on Sirohiya is an act of reprisal, censorship and violation of his own rights and the right of the Nepali people to freedom of information and freedom of press, which is also a collective form of rights.We believe that he might have been arrested in relation to the reporting of financial fraud by people in power. Many people with whom I have interacted say that that safe space of expression is shrinking in Nepal. There are incidents where people have been arrested for criticising people in authority.Unregulated generative artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a big threat. How can it be regulated?Globally, information technology and AI present many opportunities for people. But they also present risks. Amnesty International has focused on the risks. We have identified discrimination and biases. Data upon which some of these AI tools are based are inherently biased. They are based on a sample of a certain group of people, which can not be the ground for effective policy making. We are campaigning against the use of AI for facial recognition for mass surveillance. It is a violation of the freedom of movement and freedom of privacy, and many communities around the world are disproportionately affected.We have done several studies that show that mass surveillance and facial recognition are used in the most impoverished African-American communities in the United States, Muslim communities in India and Palestinian communities in Israel and occupied territories. Cyber surveillance and spyware are other problems which have been widely used to target journalists and human rights defenders, as well as opponents. We have been demanding that spyware be regulated. So far, this has been excluded from different regulations related to information technology.Generative AI has huge implications for the world, societies and human beings. Currently, only the European Union has made attempts to regulate it by adopting an AI Act last December. This is imperfect but is a first step. We have criticised it because it excludes cyber surveillance and the use of AI for security purposes, and it doesn’t stop the use of AI targeted at refugees and migrants. Nevertheless, other aspects of the law are positive. Do you think other countries should follow the European Union’s footsteps?Yes, they can build on it without going below the benchmark. We encourage all countries to prepare and enact better laws. We are calling on governments to take it as an example, but after correcting the shortcomings.Why do you think Nepal’s transitional justice process has been stuck? What can human rights organisations like Amnesty do to push it forward?Sadly, the transitional justice process hasn’t progressed in several countries. I think the leaders are so keen to preserve the peace that they are prepared to give up on justice. They fear that if they open the gate to judicial reparation and investigation, what has been achieved so far will be dismantled. That’s the fear that I have seen everywhere. Everywhere, including in Nepal, the leaders create opposition between peace and justice.You can see many governments are opposing the International Criminal Court prosecutors’ arrest warrant in relation to Gaza, saying it will create problems in agreeing on a ceasefire. This is nonsense.Peace and justice are two sides of the same coin. In fact, peace is not sustainable without justice. When justice is not delivered, the conflict is bound to recur. It is just a matter of time. We often hear the excuse that if a particular leader or a person is prosecuted, that would affect peace. On the contrary, not investigating the perpetrator is a real challenge to peace. Many people who are in power after a peace deal themselves are guilty of war crimes. They don’t want to be held accountable. It is not in their interest to deliver transitional justice. It takes an incredible, highly moral and principled leadership to take the process ahead.We have seen here that the transitional justice process has been paralysed. Successive governments have failed to act on the Comprehensive Peace Accord. They haven’t acted on what the Supreme Court told them in 2015. It had directed them to review, revise and reform the Transitional Justice Act.Here I have seen the categorisation of crimes as serious and non-serious, which is very strange. It is shocking to me that some killings are considered non-serious, and could lead to de facto amnesty for those responsible for them, even though these crimes fall under international law. If someone was killed after torture then two crimes have been committed—torture and killing. Right to life is the most important right. The investigation should be done accordingly. The same is the case with sexual violence with rape and without rape.What is alarming is that people are losing trust. If people do not trust the systems that are supposed to deliver justice, that will cause a big problem. The Truth and Reconciliation Commission and the Commission of Investigation on Enforced Disappeared Persons couldn’t undertake proper investigation and prosecution. Not all have received the government’s relief, which has led to much frustration and animosity. There is political interference on transitional justice, which also lacks independence and transparency.We are calling on the authorities to act as directed by the Supreme Court, ratify the statute on the International Criminal Court as well as the International Convention on Disappearance. Do you see chances of international interference if Nepal continues to delay justice delivery?There is no doubt that some crimes committed during the war fall within universal jurisdiction. If the perpetrators of those crimes travel to countries where a framework of universal jurisdiction has been enacted, they could be arrested there. We are seeing the multiplication of universal jurisdiction cases in Europe.Cases of custodial deaths, torture and extrajudicial killings are common in Nepal. How can they be checked?Different organisations like Amnesty International should be monitoring the abuse of power by the police and state authorities. There must be impartial and fair investigation of such incidents. But there is a regime of impunity. The police are not very keen to investigate themselves. I wanted to mention the case of Ajit Mijar, which is an example of justice being denied. It also shows the complicity of the institution in denying justice.Nepal is ranked the fourth most vulnerable country due to climate change though it contributes negligibly in greenhouse gas emissions. The largest polluters haven't fulfilled their responsibilities towards Nepal. How can organisations like Amnesty advocate for countries like Nepal?Amnesty International has long been advocating for climate justice. We have a set of demands. We are advocating at the United Nations level and also at the COP. We are pushing through COP our message of loss and damage, about the responsibilities of industrialised countries to cut their reliance on fossil fuel industries and so on. The impact of global warming will lead to loss of lives in places like Nepal and Pacific Islands.We saw very timid steps taken in COP in UAE last year. These steps are far from sufficient. We see countries multiplying their investments in fossil fuel while big fossil fuel companies are also violating their written commitment to decrease the reliance on fossil fuels. This is alarming.However, we have made some progress on loss and damage. Governments are recognising the principle of loss and damage for the countries that are least responsible for climate change. They can rely on some kind of global financial system to protect and support them in case of a sudden climate related crisis. We are now advocating for the responsible countries to set aside the necessary funds.Nepal is at the receiving end of climate change though the country is not responsible for it. However, the Nepali government also has a responsibility towards its people. The extreme weather risk faced by Nepal demands urgent acts from the authorities. The most vulnerable communities are at particular risk. The government must have instruments to protect them.  \nThe CPN (Unified Socialist), which was fashioned in 2021 by a splinter faction of the CPN-UML, is preparing to hold its first general convention. The party has done poorly in all elections since its establishment. It has also failed in service delivery despite continuously being in the government since its inception. The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal caught up with the party’s General Secretary, Ghanashyam Bhusal, for insights about the Unified Socialist’s upcoming general convention and broader political dynamics. Your party is holding its first general convention in a few weeks. What new things does the party have to offer?Our party was born in the context of sharp division between political forces over the issue of Parliament dissolution by then prime minister KP Sharma Oli, chairman of the CPN-UML, which was then also our party. That was the immediate reason for the party split. But there were other disputes within the UML. The differences were about the political line and party orientation. After Oli’s election as the party leader, policy issues were undermined. In fact, we were at odds because of the policy issues.What were those policy disputes?We [our faction] believed that after the establishment of democratic republic system, the fight for a political system was almost over as this is the most progressive political system of our time. We stressed that now the political line and programmes of the party should be updated and the focus shifted to attaining prosperity. Democracy can’t be sustained if we can’t promote industry, create jobs and ensure good governance. So we have to orient our policies to ensure these achievements. In our country, comprador capitalists, who want to earn money without running industries, are dominant. They shift the state’s policies in collusion with politicians, bureaucrats, police and other state agencies. Likewise, the economic policy doesn’t talk about jobs and production but only growth and development. These factors are detrimental to our economy. We wanted to change these policies and dynamics. We had differences on these issues with Oli. When we were debating them with him, the Parliament dissolution created a sort of abnormal situation. We stood against it, defying our party chief Oli. That division eventually led to the party split. Many people, including leaders in our own party, saw Parliament dissolution as the only reason behind the birth of our party. The new party was confused about the way forward. The upcoming general convention will formulate clear policies in this connection. What about the leadership? Will the party get new leadership?For the past two decades, I have been advocating that a communist party should adopt the right programmes to bring about social changes. At the time, the Maoists had a policy of seizing state power through force, and the UML was talking only about transforming society through elections. But the UML was basically engaged only in winning elections. In this context, we [a group of UML leaders] came up with some policies that would make substantive changes in such ritualistic practices.Now, I have been saying that our party should be led by a leader who can internalise and effectively implement those policies. We have almost finalised the party’s policy documents. When the documents are circulated among party workers, the debate about who is eligible to implement these policies will start.You often claim to be the proponent of the CPN (Unified Socialist)’s party line. If so, will you claim party leadership to implement those policies?The first condition to become the party leader is that he/she should internalise the policies and programmes adopted by the party. I shouldn’t say that no one besides me has internalised them. It is true that I have been actively leading the debates and discussions to introduce new policies in the party. Party representatives will debate and decide this at the convention.A large number of senior leaders quit the UML to form this party. But it couldn’t even retain its members let alone further expand.There was a need for radical reforms and restructuring in communist organisations and their policies. This should have been done by the country’s largest communist party—the CPN-UML. But the party leadership and its rank and file didn’t realise the need for it. There was no serious policy discussion in the UML. While the leadership of the CPN (Unified Socialist) and its organisation are oriented in the right direction, it’s not properly trained for such restructuring. Therefore, many even accused the party leadership of being just a follower and subservient to the Nepali Congress and the Maoist Centre. Various sections of society who had praised us for standing against Oli’s wrong decision didn’t appreciate other political moves of our party. Parliament dissolution was a political event. A party needs clear programmes and agenda to keep public support. Unfortunately, we were found wanting in this regard. We should have done something in job creation and increasing production. We will make such things clear at the upcoming convention. Since its formation, the party has been constantly bickered over power sharing with other parties and even party leaders always seem to be wrangling for ministerial berths. Don’t you think such activities weaken the party?This happened as the party lacked clear policies to move ahead. Standing against Oli became sort of its policy as there was deep resentment against him. As far as the leaders’ attachment to power is concerned, the party was born out of power [from Parliament, not from the ground]. So the struggle for power is linked to its genesis. It has been in power ever since its establishment. These allegations were hence natural, and the party leadership couldn’t clarify things. We couldn’t show what we did for the betterment of the society.Party chair Madhav Kumar Nepal and other top leader Jhalanath Khanal seem to be working at cross-purposes. Nepal seems closer to the Congress while Khanal has been consistently lobbying for an alliance with the UML and the Maoist Centre.We have almost resolved this issue in the course of finalising the party’s policy document. Our conclusion is that, in general, the Congress mainly represents neoliberals and comprador capitalists. When we lobby for the country’s independent economic policy, the Congress may not agree. The party tilts more towards pro-western ideas in the name of liberalism. We in our party are in consensus that in the long-run we will compete against the Congress. But we shouldn’t forget that we got the current democratic system and the constitution only after fighting jointly with the Congress. So we have to keep our doors open for collaboration with the Congress in order to safeguard this system and the constitution. It is also historically proven that the Congress and left forces should stand together to safeguard democratic system. Thus we have now made our theoretical standing clearer.But in practical aspects, as you said, there are some differences. Party chair doesn’t want to increase distance with the Congress as he worked closely with Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba and other leaders to fight Oli ji. But Jhalanath Khanal ji is for left alliance.While there are already major communist forces such as the CPN-UML and the Maoist Centre, why is one more communist force, CPN (Unified Socialist), needed? How do you prove your relevance?The CPN-UML didn’t follow the right policies, even those endorsed by its general conventions. Party chief Oli wants total control of the party organisation, from the centre to the local units. The entire party is mobilised mainly to realise Oli’s personal ambitions. This party can’t work in favour of the society in the long run. The Maoist Centre hasn’t succeeded in transforming itself from war-era rigidity of Maoism. The Unified Socialist is here to correct these two major deviations of Nepal’s communist movement. Had the party raised this issue prominently right since its formation, people would have understood its relevance. We will do it now. This convention will be a landmark event in this connection as well. Many people think that the Unified Socialist will ultimately merge with the UML.Merger is not a solution. Even if you want to bring two parties together, you have to unify them. A merger brings top leaders together based on power sharing, just like the merger of the UML and Maoist Centre in 2018. Such a merger is guided mainly by the interests of certain leaders. That’s why the merger didn’t last. The need now is unification among communist parties based on policies and programmes. Otherwise, it will be nothing more than a gathering of leaders. There is no point in merging the party to make the UML bigger and make Oli prime minister one more time.As a leader of a ruling coalition partner, how confident are you of the stability of this alliance?Given the composition of the present Parliament, we can’t rule out the making and breaking of different coalitions until the next election. Oli ji used to talk of the Unified Socialist as a tumour removed after a surgery. His mindset that he can do anything in Nepali politics has suffered a setback. Therefore, he became ready for this coalition. If he has realised this change, this coalition will last. But if he again tries to manoeuvre to justify his dissolution of Parliament and serve any other interests, there might even be other coalitions.Why has your party been in a state of disharmony with coalition partners right from the beginning?Initially, the prime minister didn’t consult with us while making this coalition. That created misunderstanding. He eventually admitted his mistake in failing to inform us on time and sought our support. So, that chapter was closed. Now we have no issue at the party’s level, and officially, we are committed to this coalition. \nOver three decades of experience, United Nations Resident Coordinator in Nepal, Hanaa Singer-Hamdy, highlights Nepal's progress in poverty reduction, health, education, and infrastructure, while emphasizing challenges such as inequality, climate change, and financing gaps.
