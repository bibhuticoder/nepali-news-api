Write it in the form of inspiring story not news article or event.\n    \n    Story:\nOnce upon a time, nestled between the towering peaks of the Himalayas and the lush jungles of the Terai, there was a country named Nepal. Though still a developing nation, Nepal was a land of profound beauty and deep-rooted cultural heritage. The residents of Nepal faced many challenges, but beneath these hardships lay a resilient spirit and an unyielding hope for the future.\n\nThis enchanting land, where Mount Everest reaches towards the skies and the air carries a mix of incense and cool mountain breezes, was more than a geographical marvel. It was a mosaic of cultures, languages, and traditions, a testament to human endeavor against all odds. Nepal's history, from the unification under King Prithvi Narayan Shah to its transformation into a federal democratic republic, told a story of aspiration and endurance.\n\nIn recent years, the people of Nepal, with their indomitable will, had taken strides towards rebuilding and reimagining their country. They turned their struggles into stepping stones, each challenge a chapter in their ongoing saga. The shift from a monarchy to a republic had not only changed governance but had woven a new tapestry of democratic values and collective decision-making.\n\nEconomically, while agriculture continued to sustain a large part of its population, Nepal had begun to harness the potential of its picturesque landscapes, developing sustainable tourism that promised to preserve their natural heritage while boosting local economies. Communities living in the shadows of the Himalayas had become stewards of the earth, protecting the biodiversity that made their country unique.\n\nEach day brought new stories. Whether it was a festival in Kathmandu, a technological advance in Pokhara, or a conservation effort in Chitwan, these events were threads in the vibrant quilt of Nepali life. These stories, updated daily, reflected the pulse of progress and the spirit of hope that characterized this resilient nation.\n\nAnd so, as Nepal moved forward, each moment was not just a passage of time but a promise of potential, a narrative of a nation perennially climbing towards tomorrow, guided by the legacy of its past and the dreams of its future.\n\nNews events:\nNearly two weeks after the declaration of several districts and local units ‘disaster crisis zones’, the disaster victims still await the help promised by the federal government. Floods and landslides triggered by incessant rains on September 27 and 28 caused widespread devastation in multiple districts. A few days later, the Cabinet meeting on October 4 decided to declare 41 local units of 12 districts ‘disaster crisis zones.’ However, people in the worst-hit areas are yet to get support from the federal government. Dinesh Lama, the chairperson of Roshi Rural Municipality in Kavrepalanchok, says many local units are still waiting for help. The government was supposed to deposit Rs10 million in local units’ disaster management funds, but the amount is yet to come, according to Lama.“We were told that our rural municipality was on the list of disaster crisis zones, but we have yet to get help from Singha Durbar [the seat of the federal government],” Lama told the Post. “Except for the helicopter assistance to distribute relief materials in the upper parts of the municipality, we haven’t received the help we should have as a disaster crisis zone.” Lama also claimed to have completed the rescue operation, and they are now focused on relief distribution and repairing damaged roads in the municipality. Like Dinesh Lama of Roshi Rural Municipality, Deepa Bohara, chairperson of Sunkoshi Rural Municipality in neighbouring Sindhuli district, said their local units have also not received any help from the federal government. “Our municipality suffered more infrastructure damage than human loss, but we are yet to get the Rs200,000 compensation announced by the government for the families of the deceased,” Bohara told the Post. “We were supposed to receive it through the District Administration Office, but we are still waiting.”At least three people lost their lives in the floods and landslides in her municipality, Bohara said.Deputy chair Rajan Prasad Ghimire of Konjyosom Rural Municipality in Lalitpur said the local units within the Kathmandu Valley have also not received adequate assistance from the federal government. Our local municipality has received Rs200,000 for each bereaved family and an additional Rs15,000 for those whose houses were damaged by the rain. Beyond this, we have not received any help from the federal government.“The federal government should have shifted those who have been rendered homeless due to the continuous rain to a safer place,” Ghimire told the Post. “The budgets of the local units in disaster crisis zones should have been increased, but the government has not taken necessary steps.”But Dil Kumar Tamang, information officer for the Ministry of Home Affairs, denies the claims made by local unit representatives. Tamang said the government has been distributing relief through the district disaster management units.“The monetary assistance the local units are receiving was sent by the federal government,” Tamang told the Post. “But there are still a few places where relief materials have yet to reach.”Tamang said that the government would soon resettle the displaced people.Meanwhile, Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli on Wednesday said that the government would expedite reconstruction and resettlement in areas affected by floods and landslides, with plans to develop safe and integrated settlements.Oli said that decisions on preliminary relief and temporary housing and bridge construction would be taken at the meeting of the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council, and a subsequent Cabinet meeting on Thursday. He said this while receiving a memorandum from a delegation from Khotang district at the Prime Minister’s Residence in Baluwatar on Wednesday. The memorandum concerned the damages from rain-induced disasters.The government had declared dozens of local units in districts hardest hit by the incessant rains as ‘disaster crisis zones’ to expedite rehabilitation, recovery, and reconstruction efforts. The October 4 Cabinet meeting named the most affected local units based on the recommendations from the Ministry of Home Affairs’ National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Authority (NDRRMA). According to the Home Ministry, at least 26 districts were badly affected by the incessant rain, and 12 of them were the hardest hit. Several local units from Panchthar, Okhaldhunga, Udayapur, Dhading, Dolakha, Ramechhap, Sindhupalchok, Lalitpur, Kavre, Sindhuli, Makawanpur, and Chitwan districts are on the list of disaster crisis zones. Under the Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Act 2017, the government can announce a disaster-crisis area to respond to a calamity by specifying its boundaries and a time limit.In crisis-designated areas, the government can make decisions such as prohibiting any operation that may adversely affect rescue work, employing government or non-governmental employees, and using government, non-government, or private movable and immovable property as needed for disaster rescue work, as per the Act.The Act says that if necessary, the government can seize vehicles from any agency or person in the designated areas and use them for relief and rescue operations. It can also fast-track procurement procedures to expedite reconstruction and rehabilitation efforts in the crisis-hit areas. \nIn July 2024, the sudden death of Anna Sebastian Perayil, a 26-year-old chartered accountant with an Indian affiliate of British accounting firm Ernst & Young (EY), sent shockwaves through social media and corporate corridors alike. Her family claimed that extreme work pressure pushed her to exhaustion, leading to her demise. Perayil’s death has now started a broader conversation about hustle culture, its glorification, and its impact on mental and physical health—questions that ripple beyond Indian corporate spaces to touch on workplaces and educational institutions worldwide, including in Nepal.While hustle culture is often associated with startup scenes or Silicon Valley tech giants, its grip extends beyond the corporate world into educational systems, especially in South Asia, where the lines between ambition and overwork often blur.Hustle culture is no longer limited to workplaces; it is creeping into colleges, where the pressure to excel and multitask is mounting. Shukraraj (whom the Post is identifying by only his first name), is a 22-year-old student at one of Kathmandu’s top colleges, who once dreamed of being a part of the prestigious institution. But three years into his degree, the reality has set in. “Many people dream of getting into this college… that’s how its reputation is. But internally, the pressure, rigidness, and push that this college puts on students in the name of ‘holistic growth’ is insane,” Shukraraj said.Shukraraj’s experience mirrors that of many students who, apart from their academic workload, are also expected to juggle extracurricular activities, internships, and never-ending assignments. “We have to be at the college’s beck and call. There’s so much to do, and if we fall sick and happen to be absent, they even give detention as a punishment for being absent—for being ‘sick,’” he says. His friend, who injured her leg during a Chhath celebration last year and missed a few classes, was given four days of detention and extra assignments. “They don’t see students as humans, just robots who should always excel.”Sukraraj’s words carry particular weight, especially when viewed in the context of Perayil’s death.Although one incident occurred in the corporate world and the other in an academic setting, the underlying problem remains the same: hustle culture’s dehumanising effect, where individuals are treated as mere cogs in a productivity machine.A study conducted on 6,972 workers in China found that unreasonable and long working hours negatively affected self-rated health (how individuals perceive their own health), leading to chronic fatigue and even death. Similarly, a large cross-sectional study published in Oxford Academic, of 24,685 employees in Japan revealed that overtime work indirectly increased stress levels through factors like mental workload, self-assessed amount of work, and reduced sleep, ultimately lowering organisational profitability.The findings of these studies align with the case of Suman Shah. The 32-year-old marketing executive from Sunsari spent six years climbing up the corporate ladder, only to realise that hustle culture had consumed him from the inside out. His typical workday began at 5 am and extended late into the night. “The culture in my advertising agency celebrated those who could outwork everyone, and I took that to heart,” he said. But the physical toll became unbearable—headaches, high blood pressure, digestive issues, and, eventually, a thyroid condition. Shah, like Perayil, realised too late that the pursuit of productivity was affecting his well-being. “In a country like Nepal, where job security is precious, I thought hustle was my only way forward—but it cost me my health.”Shah eventually left the job in 2024, moving to a smaller marketing firm in Ilam, where the work culture is friendlier.However, his story reflects a growing trend of employees burning out and leaving their jobs due to excessive stress.In fact, a study by the UK-based financial consulting firm Deloitte revealed that 77 percent of workers have experienced burnout, and 42 percent left their jobs because of it. “Hustle culture, with its glorification of constant work and productivity, takes a heavy toll on students and workers alike, affecting them on mental, emotional, and physical levels,” says Pratiksha Rajopadhyaya, a Kathmandu-based psychologist. According to Rajopadhyaya, the pressure to be continuously productive leads to chronic stress, burnout, and even conditions like anxiety and depression. “Mentally, the never-ending push to perform can cause sleep disorders, constant fatigue, and emotional exhaustion.”For many students and employees alike, the drive to succeed breeds feelings of inadequacy as they struggle to meet the often unrealistic expectations set for them. The emotional toll is huge, manifesting in what Rajopadhyaya describes as “imposter syndrome,” where individuals feel they are never good enough, no matter how much they achieve.Over time, this chronic stress erodes both personal satisfaction and professional productivity, a paradox in a culture that equates workaholism with success.“Nowadays, social media platforms like Instagram and TikTok are filled with influencers glorifying late-night work sessions, promoting the belief that personal worth is tied to productivity,” says Shukraraj.“At my college, it’s the same—most students are constantly exhausted due to the institution’s emphasis on the ‘rise-and-grind’ mentality, where meeting deadlines and fulfilling responsibilities overshadow rest and social life,” he adds.The question now arises: how can institutions—both academic and corporate—address the negative effects of hustle culture? According to Rajopadhyaya, for universities, the answer lies not only in monitoring students’ academic performance but also in caring for their emotional well-being. Schools and colleges must build environments that encourage learning without the constant pressure to excel in every domain.“Meanwhile, corporate environments must reevaluate their definitions of success and productivity. As research has shown, quality work comes from satisfied, well-rested employees, not those teetering on the edge of burnout,” she adds.As the discussion sparked by Perayil’s death continues, it serves as a timely reminder that the hustle culture’s promise of success often comes at too high a price.  \nRoad networks have now connected the far-flung Karnali region, providing hope to people, mostly apple farmers, who can now send their produce to the markets and get reasonable prices.However, the poorly-constructed road networks have become a bane for the villagers. Whenever the crops become market-ready, disaster strikes. Rural roads are often a lifeline for these communities, but they remain closed most of the time due to an increase in disasters, which experts attribute to climate change.Now, some apple growers are discussing whether their harvests could be sent to bordering Tibetan cities, as roads are frequently damaged during the monsoon season at peak harvest time, halting supplies to the Nepali market. “It would be a great relief for apple growers in Humla if they could export apples to the Chinese cities,” said Namgyal Tamang, former president of Humla Chambers of Commerce and Industry.The apple farm in Dolpa covers 412 hectares. However, the district faces difficulties in sending the fruit to the market. Farmers complain that their apples often go to waste. Last year, Dolpa produced 3,696 tonnes of apples, but only 50 tonnes made it to the market, according to Ganesh Adhikari, chief of the Agriculture Development Office, Dolpa.“Roads are usually closed during the apple harvest, which is a big problem,” said Adhikari. “Many farmers store their apples using traditional methods. If the apples don’t decay, traders take them to markets like Nepalgunj and Surkhet.”Adhikari said apple production has increased this season, with output reaching 4,000 tonnes.In Simkot, the headquarters of Humla, apples have been planted on 518 hectares. Last year, the district produced 4,224 tonnes of apples, but none reached the market. Although a road network reached Simikot in March this year, transportation is completely stalled in Humla leaving farmers unable to sell their fruits.“The road has reached Simikot, but it has been three months since no vehicles have been operating. Some farmers use mules to transport apples, worried that the fruit will decay,” said Dasharath Rokaya, an apple farmer in ward 7 of Simkot rural municipality. “Shipping apples by air costs more than the fruit is worth,” he said.Rokaya said that apples go to waste every year due to a lack of roads. His orchard, which spans 25 ropani (1.27 hectares), has 150 apple trees. The cost to transport a kilo of apple from Humla to Nepalgunj by air is Rs130. And from Humla to Surkhet, it costs Rs120 per kg.Nimayangjum Lama of Bargaun in ward 3 of Simkot rural municipality, has set up a storage using traditional methods to keep apples for a month. “Nobody comes to buy in bulk. Though I store the apples, half of them decay,” she said.According to Lama, 25 big apple farms are operating in Simkot village. She said that apples are sent through flight only when the passenger takes them as gifts.Currently, an apple fetches up to Rs10. High quality apples produced in the upper reaches of Tilgufa municipality in Kalikot also go to waste.“There is a bumper production this year, but there is no road to transport them,” bemoaned Dhan Bahadur Shahi, a local farmer of Chilkhaya in Kalikot. “The high transport costs are another issue that farmers say do not cover the cost of production.”Last year, Shahi produced 42 tonnes of apples, but this season, output dropped to 30 tonnes as a hailstorm damaged the plants. His orchard has 500 apple trees. Sending apples to the Tarai cities through the Karnali highway using porters costs Rs10 per kg.In recent years, farmers in Phoimahadev, Chilkhaya, Rachuli, Jubitha, Chappre, Odanku of Mahabai, Gela, Mugraha of Subhakalika, Sukatiya, and Bharta of Kalikot have been engaged in commercial farming of apples.Although vehicles can reach the village from Nagma and Rachuli Bazar during winter, roads are generally obstructed during the rainy season, causing many problems for the farmers, said Parek Bahadur Shahi, a farmer from Jubetha.“Traders with their vehicles can reach farmers’ orchards in Jumla. If the road could operate round-the-year, all the apples could reach the market,” Parek said. “It is difficult for us to take our produce to the market, and on top of that, we don’t get fair prices for our products.”He said the village's lack of cold storage, packaging, and grading facilities forces farmers to harvest apples before they ripen. “Apples are sold for Rs45 per kg in the village.”Last year, 5,860 tonnes of apples were produced across 605 hectares in Kalikot.According to statistics from the Karnali province’s Ministry of Land Management, Agriculture and Cooperatives, apple is being grown on 3,419 hectares across all districts of the province except Surkhet. Last year, Karnali produced 31,000 tonnes of apples, and the production is expected to be around the same this year, said Dhan Bahadur Kathayet, spokesperson of the Land Management Ministry. He said storage problems, lack of grading, road access, and packaging contribute to the low market value of Karnali apples.Farmers are currently selling apples for Rs50 per kg. In Surkhet, a kilo of apples costs Rs125, while in Kathmandu, it reaches Rs250, Kathayat said. “With the lack of well-managed marketing, farmers are getting less value for their product, while consumers are compelled to pay high prices. Only traders and middlemen benefit.”Trucks carrying food and construction materials from Surkhet and Nepalgunj are returning with apples from Jumla, Mugu, and Kalikot.Among other districts in Karnali, Jumla produces 12,500 tonnes of apples on 3,100 hectares. While Jumla has long been renowned for its apples, the trend of commercial farming has been growing in recent years in the district.Min Bahadur Bhandari from ward 5 of Guthichaur rural municipality in Jumla has invested Rs220 million in his apple farm, which has 48,000 plants. The orchard produced 80 tonnes of apples last year. He said traders are visiting his farm to buy apples.Bhandari aims to produce 200 tonnes of apples this season. Tanka Giri of ward 3 of Guthichaur has planted 14,000 apple trees on 22 hectares with an investment of Rs70 million. It has been two years since he started apple cultivation.“There was no road in the past. When we couldn’t take those apples to the market, they were often fed to animals,” Giri said. “But now the demand for Jumla apples has reached international markets, and this has encouraged us to invest.”“Roads have been obstructed frequently for years,” said Karna Bahadur Budhathoki, a trader from Jumla. “A single day of halt in the transportation can spoil apples worth hundreds and thousands of rupees.”Budhathoki said that around 3 tonnes of apples that he purchased were spoiled. Currently, he is buying apples from farmers at Rs50 per kg. It costs an additional Rs20 per kg, which includes the cost of packaging the apples in cartons and transportation to Surkhet and Nepalgunj. \nPrime Minister KP Sharma Oli has requested with the Japanese government for the reconstruction of the BP Highway, many sections of which were damaged by the recent floods and landslides.The highway, which is the shortest route to connect some Tarai districts and eastern part of the country with the capital city Kathmandu, was built by the government of Japan. Prime Minister Oli made the request during a meeting with Japanese Ambassador Kikuta Yutaka on Wednesday, according to two officials present at the meeting.“The recent floods and landslides have badly damaged the BP Highway and it would take a huge amount of money and technical resources to rebuild it,” Oli told ambassador Kikuta, according to the officials. “So we want Japanese support once again.”An official said that Nepal drew the attention of the Japanese side and that now it is up to them to respond. “Though we have already carried out the relief work, opening of the track among other technical works remains,” the official said.During the meeting, the two sides discussed repairing the BP Highway, some sections of which are badly damaged by the recent floods and landslides, a statement issued by the prime minister’s private secretariat said. “Possible Japanese support to rebuild the highway was also discussed,” it stated.Besides Prime Minister Oli, secretary at the Ministry of Physical Infrastructure and Transportation Keshav Kumar Sharma, and joint secretary at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Krishna Prasad Dhakal, among other officials, were present at the meeting.The recent floods and landslides have completely damaged over 12 kilometres of the highway. As the vehicular movement on the shortest route to reach the eastern part of the country including some Tarai districts was halted due to the floods and landslides just ahead of Dashain festival, the government opened a temporary track to resume the highway only for light vehicles.Since reconstruction work is underway, the local Kavrepalanchok district administration has stopped vehicles plying during night time from Wednesday.In the meeting with the Japanese ambassador, Oli described the situation across the BP Highway and steps taken by the government, officials said. Oli added that the government is expecting technical and financial support from the Japanese government.According to the government assessment, it might need Rs20–25 billion for rebuilding the highway.During the time of the earthquake in 2015, some parts of the highway were damaged and the government of Japan had extended the financial and technical support, Oli told the ambassador. “Now we need a similar kind of support from the Japanese side,” Oli added.The Japanese ambassador, while expressing grief over recent damage caused by the floods and landslides, stated that he will communicate the matter to Tokyo.His response was diplomatic to the prime minister’s request, according to the officials who attended the meeting.A formal request will also be sent to the government of Japan seeking its support for rebuilding the highway, the officials said. \nWeena Pun is the author of ‘Kanchhi’ (2024), now available in bookstores across Nepal. She graduated from Stanford University and the MFA Program in Creative Writing at Cornell University. Pun currently lives in Maryland, the US. In this conversation with the Post’s Rishika Dhakal, Pun discusses her debut novel, inspired by the struggles of women in Nepal and the socio-political landscape that shapes their lives.What is your novel Kanchhi about?In a nutshell, Kanchhi is about a girl who goes missing and her mother who awaits her return. But it’s also about the hamlet Kanchhi is from, its people, its culture and the socio-political reasons Kanchhi disappears. Quiet in the background is the story of Nepal itself, just as ambitious as Kanchhi, longing for something bigger than the state it is in.How did you develop the characters in your novel? Are they purely fictional?Meticulously. I developed the characters by drafting scenes after scenes, by having the characters interact with each other, by researching them or their like in the real world, by digging deep into my own memory bank—basically, by just writing. What I just did here is describe the writing process. That’s the only way, I think. You just have to sit down and write and get a feel for the characters as you continue to suss out the story. The characters are purely fictional and not. I mean you are not going to find the characters as they are in the book in real life, but then there are also a lot of people who are very much like the characters in the novel. I think that happens because the process of creating a character involves memory, imagination and research, including observation. Even if you are molding the character after someone you know or an approximation of someone you know, the very act of imagining that character and then describing them and what they do in such a way that fits the story and pushes it forward make them fictional. It's not easy. In Kanchhi, you explore themes of rebellion, family and social expectations. What inspired you to focus on these particular themes and how do they resonate with modern day issues in Nepal? To be honest, I did not really focus on these themes. I think they just made themselves known because I am a woman from Nepal writing about women in Nepal—rebelling against family and societal pressures just comes with the territory for us. I think these themes will definitely resonate with modern day issues in Nepal because we are not that far from the turn of the millennium, the period in which my novel takes place. Unfortunately, women in Nepal today are dogged by the same issues that my characters grappled with in the 80s, 90s, and 00s. From being told to act like a girl to not laugh like a girl to policing sexuality to discriminatory citizenship clauses in the constitution—things haven’t really changed, have they?How has your journalistic background influenced your fiction writing, especially in creating a narrative that is both engaging and clear?I’m not sure. I was a fiction writer long before I was a reporter, even though my fiction publication record was non-existent at the time I joined the Post in 2013. I had, however, already begun work on the novel, and from my times writing sporadically on it, I knew I had a lot of work to do. For one, I needed to know Nepal better, and two, I needed to sharpen my interviewing skills so that I could know Nepal better. I was very shy then and scared of approaching people with questions. Reporting took those worries away and taught me that no question was stupid if you were searching for the truth. This is to say that yes, journalism must have definitely helped me with my fiction writing. I’m just not sure if it made my writing more engaging or clearer. What it definitely did was help me be able to talk to people and find things out and help me get a good overview of the larger, socio-political issues at play in the country—issues that one way or another affected my characters in rural Nepal.Gender dynamics are a significant part of Kanchhi. With the book shedding light on the societal pressures women face, what do you think is the role of literature in challenging or reflecting these gender norms in Nepali society? The role of literature in reflecting gender norms in Nepali society is unavoidable, even when it’s a man writing a story that on the surface has nothing to do with gender dynamics. The inclusion, exclusion and the nature of inclusion and exclusion of women in literature say a lot about gender norms, roles and perceptions in the society that the work of literature is based in. Now, the writer might not set out to reflect these realities, but it just happens. When you write about the society you know, you end up showing it a mirror. Whether the work of literature might end up challenging the prevalent gender norms, though, depends upon the writer and the nature of work itself because challenging something requires deliberation, requires effort, and not every writer is up for that. But then, maybe if you are not up for that, you are not producing a genuine work of literature? But then what is a genuine work of literature? I don’t know. I’ll have to think harder on this.In recent years, there has been a growing interest in global literature from Nepal. What do you think is driving this increasing attention to Nepali stories and what role does Kanchhi play in this trend?My reading on this is that the writers who were born in the 80s and grew up in the 90s during that wave of economic liberalization, globalization and the start of the multi-party democracy in Nepal have now come of age. These writers grew up learning English in ‘boarding’ schools, grew up reading global literature written in or translated into English, and grew up practicing their constitutionally protected right to freedom of speech. Meaning, we are now more than ready to engage with global literature, talk to it or at it, and tell our own stories. I think the interest is only going to grow, as more Nepalis become fluent in the language of global literature. As for where Kanchhi fits in all this—I think it fits squarely in there. Kanchhi is an attempt to tell a story of a girl in rural Nepal in English by a woman from Nepal who grew up reading world literature in the 90s and the early 2000s and who always wanted to see her own stories reflected in it. I, and by extension Kanchhi, are a product of our times.What do you hope readers will remember about Kanchhi? For some reason, this is a really hard question. Let me try answering this by telling you an anecdote about how I had felt when I first read Arundhati Roy’s The God of Small Things. I read the book in 2005 when I was in my second year of A-levels. What wowed me the most about the book was the fact that it was about a South Asian country written by a South Asian writer, written in English and written very well. Something I had not realized was possible or had forgotten that it was possible since we did read R. K. Narayan in English classes. So, my point is, I remember that feeling of wonder when I first read The God of Small Things, and while I am no Arundhati Roy and Kanchhi is not The God of Small Things, I still hope that my readers are able to find something in Kanchhi that they can cherish forever.Weena Pun’s book recommendationsThe Copenhagen Trilogy by Tove Ditlevson: An amazing series of memoirs that talks about the working-class life as it is. No exoticization, no romanticization, no beseeching for pity, no triumphalist narrative. Just a narration of life as it was. The Things They Carried by Tim O’Brien: This is an exceptional account of the Vietnam War told like it was—a theme emerging here. I return to this book every once in a while, to remember what a fast-paced, honest fiction feels like. This Boy’s Life by Tobias Wolff: Another memoir but reads like fiction. The details and the pacing here are just absolutely amazing. Makes me want to write about my life like that.How to Love Your Daughter by Hila Blum: Plotwise, nothing happens, but the writing (even in translation, which is what I read) is exquisite. The anguish of a mother who cannot bear that her daughter has chosen to be estranged from her is all over the book but is never maudlin. Wish I had come across this book while I was drafting Kanchhi—or maybe not.Mothers and Others by Sarah Blaffer Hrdy: When I was a new mother (yup, motherhood is another theme here) and wracked with fear and anxiety, this anthropological work pulled me through. It let me know indirectly that my anxiety was normal and had an evolutionary basis and therefore benefits. This online version of the interview has been edited for clarity  \nThe Supreme Court has ordered senior advocate Gopal Krishna Ghimire, president of the Nepal Bar Association, to submit a written response within seven days regarding a contempt of court case against him.The top court progressed with the contempt proceedings based on the case filed by the Supreme Court’s Deputy Registrar, Govind Prasad Ghimire, alleging contempt against the Bar President. During the hearing on Thursday, a bench comprising Justices Kumar Regmi and Kumar Chudal directed Ghimire to file a written response within the stipulated time frame.“If there are any grounds for not issuing the order as requested by the petitioner, provide evidence along with a response in writing either personally or through a legal representative within seven days from the date of receiving this notice, in addition to submitting a copy of the petition,” the apex court said.On September 27, the Judicial Council nominated two high court chief judges as Supreme Court justices despite lawyers’ sit-in on the council premises, protesting against the nominations. Ghimire, the NBA president, had criticised the nominations, accusing the council of selecting the two judges in exchange for money.Deputy Registrar Ghimire filed the petition at the court on September 30 demanding legal action against the NBA president. \nThe top leaders of Nepal’s three major political parties have agreed to expedite the formation of the search committee to recommend candidates for the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) and the Commission of Investigation on Enforced Disappeared Persons as soon as possible. During a meeting held at the Prime Minister’s residence in Baluwatar on Thursday, the leaders decided to fast-track the remaining tasks of the peace process.Leaders from the Nepali Congress, the CPN-UML, and the Maoist Centre agreed to give full shape to the search committee entrusted to select heads and members of the commissions, said Shakti Basnet, a deputy general secretary of the Maoist Centre. The next Cabinet meeting, scheduled for Friday, is expected to give full shape to the search committee.“The Cabinet will decide the members of the search committee in its upcoming meeting, accelerating the formation of both the TRC and the Commission of Investigation on Enforced Disappeared Persons,” a source close to the prime minister stated.Prime Minister and CPN-UML Chairman KP Sharma Oli, Nepali Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba, and Maoist Centre Chairman Pushpa Kamal Dahal, who is also leader of the main opposition in the House, were present at the meeting. Other leaders in attendance included Home Minister Ramesh Lekhak, Maoist Centre’s Basnet, and Attorney General Ramesh Badal.Basnet added that Thursday’s meeting agreed to finalise the search committee, which had been initiated by his party chair, Dahal, when he was prime minister before being replaced by Oli in mid-July.“The meeting to expedite the remaining tasks of the peace process follows the decision made during Maoist Centre chair Dahal’s premiership. The parties had agreed to form a search committee to select candidates for the two commissions,” Basnet said.Previously, the Parliament passed a bill related to transitional justice, which was ratified by the President on August 29. The House of Representatives passed the bill on August 14, followed by its approval by the National Assembly on August 22.The two commissions have been paralysed since July 2022 after the government decided to extend their terms without retaining their chairmen and members. \nMinister for Culture, Tourism, and Civil Aviation Badri Prasad Pandey has instructed the Pashupati Area Development Trust (PADT) to suspend all activities related to vacating the Gaushala Dharmashala.As the chairperson of PADT, Pandey issued the directive on Wednesday, citing concerns over security in the area, according to a letter from the ministry addressed to the PADT.Pandey has also called for a PADT Executive Council meeting on Sunday at the Ministry of Culture, Tourism, and Civil Aviation to discuss the issue, PADT spokesperson Rewati Raman Adhikari said.The dispute over the management of Gaushala Dharmashala escalated after the PADT, on Tuesday, accused Marwadi Sewa Samiti of seeking to acquire the land on which the pilgrims’ shelter stands, located northwest of the Gaushala crossroads.On May 23, 2003, the Trust and the Samiti reached an agreement that allowed the Samiti to manage the property for an annual rent of Rs51,000. However, in recent years, PADT has requested an increase in the nominal rent, which the Samiti refused.In response, the Trust terminated the two-decade-old agreement on August 2, 2023, and decided to reclaim the 9.5 ropani (0.48 hectares) of land and infrastructure. It also handed over the responsibility of managing the property to the Kathmandu Metropolitan City.Challenging this decision, the Samiti took the matter to the Kathmandu District Court. However, on October 2, the court dismissed the case, ruling that the Samiti had failed to substantiate its claims.Following the court’s decision, the trust and the metropolis began efforts to take possession of the property, but they have faced resistance from individuals linked to the Samiti, a charitable organisation of the Marwadi community.The Samiti obstructed the metropolis’ attempt to claim the property on Tuesday, as well as during a previous attempt on October 9. Due to continued resistance, the metropolis administration has sought assistance from the District Administration Office, Kathmandu. Meanwhile, the Trust held a press briefing to clarify its stance.The PADT has stated that the property will be used solely for religious purposes. However, it is currently rented out for operating hotels, lodges, and restaurants, among other businesses. \nThe federal government has recommended immediate grants of Rs5 million to 10 million to each of the 71 local units declared disaster crisis zones. The financial assistance is aimed at providing relief and carrying out rehabilitation, and reconstruction works in the disaster-affected areas.In a meeting on Thursday, the executive committee of the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Authority (NDRRMA) proposed the grants in line with the declaration of these 71 local units as disaster-hit zones. The government on October 4 had declared 71 local units in 20 districts as disaster crisis zones.The local units declared disaster crisis zones are from Okhaldhunga, Panchthar, Udaypur, Solukhumbu, Khotang, Ilam, Kavrepalanchok, Lalitpur, Dolakha, Sindhuli, Sindhupalchok, Makawanpur, Dhading, Ramechhap, Chitwan, Rautahat, Mahottari, Sarlahi, Siraha and Saptari districts.The meeting chaired by Home Minister Ramesh Lekhak on Thursday decided that nine of the worst-hit local units would receive Rs10 million each, 12 affected units would get Rs7.5 million each, and the remaining 50 units would be provided with Rs5 million each, according to NDRRMA Spokesperson Dijan Bhattarai.The proposal will now be forwarded to the National Council for Disaster Management, chaired by Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli, in a meeting scheduled for Friday.According to Bhattarai, the allocated funds will be used to restore essential services and purchase supplies such as foods and tarpaulins for relief and rescue operations.Additionally, the meeting decided to allocate a budget for procuring helicopters and equipment needed for disaster rescue operations. It also resolved to request the government to offer free health insurance to the families of those who lost their lives in disaster-related incidents through the Council.In addition to Home Minister Lekhak, Health Minister Pradeep Paudel and Minister for Federal Affairs and General Administration Rajkumar Gupta also attended the meeting. Incessant rainfall on September 27 and 28 ravaged various parts of the country including the Kathmandu Valley. At least 244 people were confirmed dead and 19 people remained unaccounted for during the disasters.  \nNepalese politicians have colluded with businessmen for mutual benefits, as seen when CPN-UML leader KP Sharma Oli accepted land for party headquarters from Min Bahadur Gurung, raising questions of corruption and favoritism.\nPre-1990 news media focused excessively on the royal family, neglecting important national issues, a trend that continued with Prime Minister Oli's recent US visit, where university speeches were inflated in importance while substantive news was downplayed.\nAI risks such as mass automation, digital divides, and privacy violations are emerging, especially in the Global South, requiring solutions like education investments, digital infrastructure expansion, and regulatory frameworks to mitigate risks and ensure inclusivity.\nDespite constitutional guarantees, Nepali women face high maternal mortality rates due to inadequate health care infrastructure, lack of skilled birth attendants, and weak implementation of policies, resulting in preventable deaths during childbirth.\nNepal's women's football team aims to break their title jinx in the SAFF Women's Championship, facing challenges from India and defending champions Bangladesh in Group B.\nThe world’s largest technology firms are flocking to Southeast Asia to build data centres at a time when demand for infrastructure and computing power to enable artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly rising.The new investments are expected to contribute to the region’s economies by creating skilled jobs in data centre construction, engineering and maintenance, while also developing specialised talent in AI, cyber security, and data science and management.The investments will also improve the region’s digital infrastructure, allowing small businesses and large institutions to store their data locally, significantly reducing downtime while increasing data sovereignty.With AI-supported innovations such as searches on ChatGPT now requiring at least four to five times more processing capacity compared with traditional internet searches, data centre demand is expected to grow at around 20 per cent a year for the next five to seven years, analysts at Maybank noted in an October report.Data centres are large facilities built to accommodate servers, data storage systems and networking equipment that support better internet services and telecommunications.This, in turn, enables popular online activities such as gaming, live-streaming and investing, as well as more advanced technologies like cloud computing and AI.Thanks to its lower costs, power availability and geopolitical neutrality, South-east Asia is emerging as an ideal region for tech operators to establish a data centre base, with the top five countries being Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia and Vietnam.While Singapore is the preferred destination for hosting data centres due to superior infrastructure and a stable regulatory regime, the Republic had imposed a three-year halt on data centre construction between 2019 and 2022 to assess its impact on the environment.Malaysia seized the bulk of new data centre investments entering the region during that period, and now expects facilities with around one gigawatt (GW) of power capacity to come online over the next two years.That is double the existing data centre capacity it currently has.Another 3GW has also been announced and, if approved, will be gradually rolled out in the next three to five years, RHB Bank said.In comparison, Singapore’s data centre capacity currently stands at around 1.4GW.Among those channelling capital into Malaysia are tech titans like Microsoft, which said in May that it will invest US$2.2 billion (S$2.9 billion) over the next four years to build cloud and AI infrastructure in the country.Amazon Web Services (AWS) in August announced plans to invest an estimated US$6.2 billion to set up a data centre and cloud region in Malaysia.More On This TopicSingapore has one of the world’s densest data centre capacities: Josephine TeoMalaysia plans national cloud policy, AI regulations as Google breaks ground on $2.57b data centreThe cloud service provider is also developing a similar region in Thailand. It revealed plans in 2024 to invest US$5 billion in data centres in the country over the next few years, making Thailand its fourth AWS region in Asean after Singapore, Indonesia and Malaysia.In September, Google said it would invest US$1 billion to build a data centre and cloud region in Thailand, which has so far seen around US$9 billion committed by operators, according to analysts at Morgan Stanley.By 2028, RHB expects Malaysia to account for over half the data centre processing power across the top five South-east Asian markets, with data centres in Johor making up the bulk of inventories at over 2.3GW.That could put the Malaysian state in close competition with Singapore as a data centre hub for the region.After partially lifting its moratorium in 2022, Singapore awarded around 80MW of new capacity to Equinix, GDS, Microsoft and an AirTrunk-ByteDance consortium in July 2023. In May, the Government announced that at least 300MW of data centre capacity may soon be provided.Still, the Republic has signalled that it will be more selective when awarding new capacity moving forward.Speaking at a conference in May, then Senior Minister of State for Communications and Information Janil Puthucheary said data centres are collectively Singapore’s biggest indirect carbon emitter.He added that existing data centres currently contribute to 82 per cent of the information and communications sector’s carbon emissions, and 7 per cent of the country’s total electricity consumption.However, Dr Janil said Singapore may still award an additional 200MW of capacity to operators that are able to tap green sources of energy to run the facilities, and will provide schemes and incentives to support such investments.Mr Dedi Iskandar, head of data centre solutions at property investment adviser CBRE, asked that the authorities provide more clarity on this front.“The industry does not have a clear picture of what’s next after the additional capacity was announced in May, or when we can bid or how. We haven’t seen this information coming, and that has created uncertainty,” he said.“When data centre operators have no line of sight, they cannot make plans to invest in Singapore.”Mr Dedi said that while Singapore is still the preferred destination for hosting mission-critical computing applications, Johor, which still struggles with issues like talent and water shortages, is improving quickly.The highest risk for Singapore arises when the price gap for building and operating a data centre compared with Johor becomes too significant, and when the quality of data centre services between the two markets narrows, he said. \nLiam Payne, former One Direction singer, died after falling from a third-floor hotel balcony in Buenos Aires, leaving fans, family, and music industry in mourning.\nCanadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Wednesday said India made “a horrific mistake” by thinking it could interfere as aggressively as it allegedly did in Canada’s sovereignty.Trudeau made the remark two days after Canada kicked out six Indian diplomats, linking them to the murder of a Sikh separatist leader in Canada and alleging a broader effort to target Indian dissidents in the country.The Canadian leader’s comments were the strongest he has made in a year-long dispute that plunged bilateral relations to a new low.“The Indian government made a horrific mistake in thinking that they could interfere as aggressively as they did in the safety and sovereignty of Canada,” he told an independent probe into foreign interference in Canadian politics.Trudeau said Ottawa could take further steps to ensure Canadians’ security but declined to give details.India denies the allegations of interference and has expelled six Canadian diplomats in a tit-for-tat move. \nIn his final months in office, President Joe Biden is signaling new willingness to use US military assistance to Israel as both a carrot and a stick to influence its high-stakes confrontation with Iran and Iran-backed militant groups.But while the approach increases Washington’s involvement in Israeli decision-making just weeks before the US presidential election, it is unclear whether it will help achieve Biden’s goals, including preventing a broader regional conflict and getting Israel to address the increasingly dire humanitarian situation in Gaza, experts say.Biden’s administration announced on Sunday it would send about 100 soldiers to Israel along with an advanced US anti-missile system, a rare deployment that came as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s government weighs a retaliatory attack on Iran after an Oct. 1 Iranian missile strike.The Biden administration also delivered Israel a letter on Sunday warning that it must take steps in the next month to improve the humanitarian situation in Gaza or face potential restrictions on US military aidBiden’s administration announced on Sunday it would send about 100 soldiers to Israel along with an advanced US anti-missile system, a rare deployment that came as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s government weighs a retaliatory attack on Iran after an Oct. 1 Iranian missile strike.The Biden administration also delivered Israel a letter on Sunday warning that it must take steps in the next month to improve the humanitarian situation in Gaza or face potential restrictions on US military aid.Publicly, US officials say the seemingly opposing moves fit within longstanding policies that aim to both ensure Israel’s defense and to advocate for protection of civilians in the year-old war in Gaza.But current and former officials privately acknowledge that they are milestones that increase US involvement in Israeli strategy even as Biden heads for the door.Israel has frequently resisted US advice and has caused political difficulties for the Biden administration, which faces pressure from some liberal activists in the Democratic Party to use US leverage to rein in Israel.Aaron David Miller, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said that the administration’s carrot-and-stick approach “implies at a time when you might not think the administration is all that active … that they are clearly thinking and acting.”But he cautioned that Washington is unlikely to scale back its military support for Israel if the conflict with Iran deepens.“It is almost inconceivable to me as we approach the possibility of a severe and serious escalation – the Israeli response and what the Iranians will do in return – that this administration could consider anything like a serious restriction or conditioning of military systems,” he said.White House spokesperson John Kirby told reporters on Tuesday that the letter was not “meant as a threat” but that it appears the Israelis are taking the issues seriously.An Israeli official in Washington said: “The letter has been received and is being thoroughly reviewed by Israeli security officials.”Israel said Wednesday that 50 aid trucks were transferred to north Gaza from Jordan, a possible early result of the US demands.A DEADLINE TO INCREASE AIDBiden has prioritized Israel’s defense since Hamas militants triggered the war by killing some 1,200 people, according to Israeli figures. He refused to halt weapons flows to Israel, except for 2,000-pound bombs, despite outcry by fellow Democrats as Israel’s war in Gaza killed 42,000 people, according to Palestinian health authorities.The administration in April demanded better protections for civilians and aid workers in Gaza, which US officials say produced a temporary rise in aid flows into the territory.But Sunday’s letter appeared to be the clearest ultimatum yet to Netanyahu’s government since the Gaza conflict began, outlining specific steps Israel must take within 30 days, including enabling a minimum of 350 trucks with aid to enter Gaza per day.It raises the possibility of Washington making Israel ineligible to receive US weapons over its restrictions on aid delivery, said John Ramming Chappell, advocacy and legal advisor at the Center for Civilians in Conflict.“It is a small step towards a very significant change,” he said.Netanyahu convened an emergency meeting on Wednesday to discuss expanding humanitarian aid to Gaza, three officials who attended the discussion said, with aid likely to increase soon.The decision to send the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense system, or THAAD, is a similarly major step, said former officials and analysts, in line with a strategy of offering the Israelis close military support with the aim of influencing how they conduct military operations.A former defense official described the deployment as a “paradigm shift,” given Israel’s long-standing security doctrine to defend itself, by itself. It also raises the stakes, potentially, for the United States.“The US is putting actual US ‘skin in the game’ by placing US forces inside Israel, that only 2 weeks ago was on the receiving end of 180 Iranian ballistic missiles,” the official said.The Middle East has been on edge awaiting Israel’s response to a missile attack earlier this month that Tehran carried out in retaliation for Israel’s military escalation in Lebanon.Biden has objected to any Israeli strike on Iran’s nuclear sites and expressed concern about a strike on energy sites.“This is probably a carrot to try to cajole the Israelis to not go big,” said Thomas Karako, director of the missile defense project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, referring to the possibility that Israel could choose to strike nuclear and other targets.“And, you know, you don’t send a multi-billion dollar asset without some strings attached.”The White House did not directly respond to a question on whether sending the THAAD to Israel may have been part of a deal for the Israelis to agree not to hit Iranian oil or nuclear sites.Time is running short for the administration.The 30 days Biden has given Israel to comply with its demands will run out after the Nov. 5 US election, giving Netanyahu the ability to decide how fully he should comply, said Miller, especially if the Republican candidate with whom he is close, former President Donald Trump, defeats the Democrat, Vice President Kamala Harris.“Netanyahu believes he is at the point of maximum leverage, and he may well be. You may have a new president-elect that is much more to his liking in a matter of weeks,” Miller added. \nThe weather is forecast to be partly to generally cloudy in the hilly areas of the country on Thursday with partly cloudy to mainly fair weather elsewhere. According to the Meteorological Forecasting Division, light to moderate rain is likely in a few places in Gandaki Province and at one or two locations in the hilly regions of Koshi Province, Bagmati Province, Karnali Province, and Sudurpaschim Province.Tonight, the weather will remain partly to generally cloudy in the hilly regions of Koshi, Gandaki, and Sudurpaschim provinces, while the rest of the country will see partly cloudy to fair skies. Light rain is expected at one or two places in the hilly regions of these provinces.According to the meteorological analysis, the country is currently experiencing a partial influence of western winds, along with some local wind effects in the hilly areas of Koshi, Bagmati, and Gandaki provinces.On Wednesday, the maximum temperature was recorded at 34.7°C in Janakpur, while the minimum was 4.3°C in Jumla. Dharan received the highest rainfall of 39.0 mm in the past 24 hours. \nStudents who fail the Secondary Education Examination (SEE) tests can now pursue pre-diploma courses in both technical and non-technical categories.The Council for Technical Education and Vocational Training (CTEVT) opened admission in various pre-diploma courses targeting non-graded students. Students failing to secure a minimum of 1.60 Grade Point Average (GPA) are categorised as non-graded and thus ineligible to study grade 11. However, they can now pursue several pre-diploma courses, opening the door for higher studies, mainly in technical subjects.The council, making a public call on Wednesday, opened admission to 25 different pre-diploma courses. Students can choose two pre-diploma courses in hotel management, three in agriculture and animal husbandry, 17 in engineering, and one each in social mobilisation, internship development, and computer application and secretariat management. All the courses span 18 months.“The council has revised the admission directives [to allow the non-graded to study pre-diploma courses],” reads the admission notice.Students clearing pre-diploma courses are eligible to study the diploma courses that are equivalent to grade 12.As many as 242,313 students—52.13 percent of the total examinees—had been categorised as non-graded in the SEE results published the last week of June. The number of total examinees stood at 464,785.Earlier, only those who were non-graded in a maximum of two subjects were eligible to take such examinations.This criteria was later changed and a decision was made allowing students who received non-graded in up to seven subjects or those who were absent in the regular exams to take the grade improvement exam.For the first time, the education ministry under Sumana Shrestha allowed all the non-graded students to sit for supplementary tests.Of the 210,321 who appeared in the grade increment test, 119,425 were graded, becoming eligible to study grade 11. Of them were 56,702 boys, 62,721 girls, and two in the ‘others’ category.Over 35,000 non-graded students didn't wish to take the supplementary tests held in August.As many as 122,888 non-graded students will be benefited from the decision to allow them to study the pre-diploma course.The eighth amendment to the Education Act restructured schools to include classes from early childhood to Grade 12 as part of the school level. However, the Grade 10 exam continues in the same format as the previous School Leaving Certificate exams.Amid high failure rate at SEE, the incumbent KP Sharma Oli government has announced that it is working to ensure that 70 percent students graduate the grade 10 examinations. The upcoming tests will be held in March next year. \nAmid widespread deaths and devastation caused by monsoon across various districts, Nepal is at a heightened risk for water-borne, vector-borne, and air-borne disease outbreaks.With most water sources contaminated by rain and floodwater, and thousands of displaced people living in makeshift shelters, experts have warned of a potential surge in infections in the coming days.“People are already getting infected with water-borne, vector-borne and air-borne diseases,” said Dr Sher Bahadur Pun, chief of the Clinical Research Unit at Sukraraj Tropical and Infectious Disease Hospital. “These problems could worsen in the coming days.” At least 209 people have been confirmed dead, while 29 others are still missing due to the floods and landslides triggered by record-breaking torrential rainfall that started Thursday evening. Additionally, 142 people have sustained various degrees of injury, and more than 4,222 others have been taken to safe places, the Home Ministry said on Monday evening. Doctors warn that the risk of water-borne, vector-borne and air-borne disease outbreaks increases in the aftermath of disasters. Nepal’s past experiences suggest the same.“People are already contracting cholera and other water-borne diseases,” said Dr Pun. “As displaced people mostly live in temporary shelters, the chances of spread of air-borne and vector-borne diseases remain high.”At least 95 people from various districts, including from Kathmandu and Lalitpur, have tested positive for cholera since the start of the monsoon in June. The Vibrio cholera 01 Ogawa serotype has been confirmed in the stool samples of the infected patients. Thousands of others were also infected with diarrheal infections after the start of the monsoon season. Diarrhoeal disease is a common and seasonal public health issue, usually triggered by unsafe food and water or hygiene issues. Likewise, six people died, and 12,644 others were hospitalised this year due to dengue, which has spread to 76 out of 77 districts across the country. Hundreds of people are contracting seasonal flu, but health authorities have no records of these cases.Officials at the Ministry of Health and Population said that they are bracing for tough days ahead, as the floodwaters not only contaminate drinking water sources but also create breeding grounds for various disease-spreading vectors.“We expect a surge in water-borne, vector-borne and air-borne diseases in the coming days, as it takes a few days for these illnesses to incubate,” said Dr Yadu Chandra Ghimire, director at the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division. “We have alerted all agencies concerned to step up vigilance and prepare to deal with any adverse situations.”Public health experts have warned that healthcare facilities in the disaster-hit districts could witness an uptick in cases of viral fever cases and waterborne diseases—diarrhoea, dysentery, food poisoning—and snakebites.Health Ministry officials say that they are aware of the risks and have directed agencies concerned to prepare accordingly.“We have stockpiled essential medicines in districts, provinces and at the central level,” said Dr Roshan Pokhrel, the secretary at the ministry. “Responding to the looming outbreaks is not only the responsibility of the Health Ministry, but also of other ministries and agencies, and we have been coordinating with them as well.”In addition to stepping up surveillance measures, stockpiling medicines, and deploying medics at the health facilities in disaster-hit areas, public health experts emphasise the importance of health awareness in reducing infections.They say a combination of careful surveys, ensuring safe drinking water, maintaining hygiene and sanitation, social mobilisation and treatment are required to contain the possible outbreaks of various ailments.The monsoon in Nepal is itself a season of epidemics with thousands of people across the country getting infected with water-borne and vector-borne diseases.The country is one of the world’s most vulnerable to the climate crisis and has witnessed extreme weather events over the past decade and a half.Evidence suggests that the maximum temperature in Nepal is rising at a greater rate (0.056 degrees Celsius per year) than the global average of 0.03 degrees Celsius per year.Experts say extreme weather events—excess rainfall in a short period, continuous rains for several days after the monsoon, dry spells, droughts, below-average precipitation, and above-normal winter temperatures—have become more frequent in Nepal.In recent years, scientists have gathered credible evidence linking the climate crisis to adverse health effects that impact the quality of life and kill people. \nAs the festive season approaches, prices of daily essentials like rice, edible oil, legumes, and lentils have increased.Retailers say food prices are expected to stay high throughout Dashain and Tihar, Nepal’s biggest festivals.In Nepal, food prices are heavily influenced by the Indian market. Even though prices have not increased in India, some opportunist traders have been taking advantage of the poor market monitoring to increase prices under different pretexts. For example, on September 14, India raised the basic import tax on crude and refined edible oils by 20 percent. Nepali importers seized this opportunity to hike their prices even though Nepal had not raised the import tax.Dhurba Prasad Adhikari, joint treasurer of the Nepal Retailers Association, said Nepali wholesalers and retailers have already raised the prices. “It has been a week since edible oil price was increased by Rs20 per litre and the price is expected to increase further as the festive demand kicks in,” he said. But he admits that market rumours and weak inspections make prices more unstable, especially during the festive season when demand is at its peak.According to the association, sunflower oil prices have increased from Rs190 to Rs210 per litre. Likewise, the per litre price of mustard oil has gone up from Rs350 to Rs370.Adhikari, who operates Adhikari Khadya Store, said the price of edible oil is expected to increase in Tihar due to high demand.Retailers said strict inspections in large trading houses could help stabilise prices during the festive season. Consumer rights activists say the current government inspections of the market are just for show and will not address issues related to price, quality, and quantity.“The government’s market inspection body is looking only at retail markets. They, too, know this will not change prices unless they also inspect the warehouses of large importers and traders,” Adhikari said. He said that the government inspecting body needs to check on the stock of goods held by traders.According to retailers, even with the new rice harvesting beginning soon, prices of the staple have increased by Rs100 kg for a 25 kg bag.Even the price of sona mansuli, which normally remains at Rs60 per kg, has now inched up to Rs70 to Rs75 per kg.Rice prices, however, are expected to decline after the arrival of the new harvest.Sugar is now being sold at Rs120 per kg and expected to rise further, retailers said.As private sector traders say they are out of sugar stock and both state supply utilities—the Salt Trading Corporation and the Food Management and Trading Company—have delayed opening the tender to import the sweetener, according to market insiders, the price is expected to cross Rs160 per kg by Tihar.However, retailers said the jeera (cumin seed) price has declined. But the price could still go up in the next two weeks.Last year during Dashain, the price of jeera, an indispensable spice, spiked from Rs1,400 to Rs1,500 per kg. The price has declined, and it is being transacted around Rs950 per kg this year, Adhikari said. Prices of lentils and legumes tend to fluctuate based on international production, but have remained high in recent months.According to the association, pulses have reached Rs180 per kg from Rs175 per kg.Adhikari said food prices have been increasing every year. “The rice prices are so high that people are buying only what they need in smaller quantities,” said Adhikari.“The government needs to intervene in the market, particularly inspect the large traders engaged in unscrupulous market activities,” said Prem Lal Maharjan, president of the National Consumer Forum. “Proper inspection will help bring the prices down. It will also help the government bring in more revenues,” he said.As the government has started operating fair-price shops across the country, there might be some relief for consumers, Maharjan said. “But such subsidised shops should be operated year-round to control market prices.”    \nDean Richard Thompson recently completed his two years as the American ambassador to Nepal. Arriving here just before the 2022 elections, he has since closely observed Nepali politics and society. Umesh Chauhan and Biswas Baral recently sat down with Thompson to reflect on his time in Nepal, major US projects in the country including those under the MCC, geopolitical competition with China, trade, and a range of other issues.How have you seen Nepali politics evolve in the two years you have been in the country? What events stood out? I’ve seen a lot of Nepali politics. Obviously, there’s been a lot of changes. I got here right before the national elections in November 2022. It was really great to see the democratic process play out here, to see Nepalis turn out in such great numbers and make their choices known.Democracy is such a vibrant and colourful exercise anywhere in the world. Nepal did not disappoint on that front. It's been fascinating to watch it evolve, to watch the governments come in different formations.What’s been great is the commitment we’ve seen from successive groups in government to moving forward and carrying forward the [bilateral] partnership and building on projects. I’ve also been amazed at some of the innovative things happening in various sectors of the economy.There has been some very exciting work in the IT sector, for example, that runs the gamut from more traditional back-office type operations to cutting-edge AI research, to developing educational apps for school students, to things like what we have been sponsoring at our Content Creator’s Mela these past two years. It is great to see Nepalis show lots of creativity in expressing themselves and talking about their culture and their society in so many different ways. Across the board, I’d say the experience has been unique.How have the Nepal-US relations evolved over the past 77 years of diplomatic ties? What are the salient features of the relationship? What I would say is we’ve always tried to listen, to engage with the Nepali society. Based on that, I think one of the things that we’ve done is refine the range of products.The Peace Corps, the USAID, the Millennium Challenge Corporation, the Development Finance Corporation, or other elements of our assistance and development commitments—these are different tools that can be employed. And Nepal has continually expanded its capacity to take advantage of them. The US has been able to increase the number of tools and assets, if you will, that Nepal can use to build its economy.I’m very proud of the fact that we have done this primarily through grant-based assistance, so that there is little in terms of downsides. At the same time, we have focused on different segments of the economy or society, for example, through the Development Finance Corporation, we’re now able to target and work with the financial sector to create more opportunities for small and medium-sized enterprises, particularly women-run enterprises. Through the USAID, we can use more of the traditional mechanisms of assistance.The Millennium Challenge Corporation kind of speaks for itself. It targets large-scale, massive infrastructure type projects that aim to be transformative in terms of Nepal’s economy. It has helped grow the road and infrastructure network and show new technology that can help expand that network and make roads safer, more reliable, and easier to maintain. It has helped build an electricity infrastructure that allows Nepal, first and foremost, to internally use the green hydropower that's at its disposal, but there will be excess capacity even to export it to the region to earn additional income. So I’m pretty excited about what I’ve seen happen over the past 77 years, and where we are today. I’m also extremely positive about building on where we are now. Can you give us a status of the implementation of projects under the Millennium Challenge Account Nepal? In the MCC, energy, obviously, is a high-priority area and so is transportation. Where we are with the projects themselves is we have let out the contracts for the sub-stations, for the 18-kilometre cross-border transmission line, and we have reissued the tender for the 297-kilometre broader transmission line package that had to be revised due to some cost changes over the time it took to implement that piece of the package.But we’re pretty positive about getting that back on track by the end of the year and putting the project firmly on the right footing for a five-year completion timeline. But there have also been hurdles, right? Do you still expect the transmission lines and road projects to be completed in five years?I expect there to be more hurdles. The biggest challenge was when the bids came back for the 297-kilometre transmission line. We had a number of delays there from Covid to worldwide inflation, to supply chain shifts that I don’t think people had foreseen completely. I’m not surprised. But the MCC has had a lot of experience around the world with these projects.It builds into this assumption that there will be challenges, there will be situations that need to be rethought and overcome. The real trick is making sure we move forward in a way that’s smart and focused on keeping things on time and on track. We're fortunate in the case of Nepal because we have a partner that has so heavily invested its own resources into the project.We have our $500 million grant and Nepal is putting in almost $200 million. It’s been made a national pride project. Look, other things will inevitably come up. But we believe that we have a good team that’s ready to tackle those types of challenges and press forward.At the end of the day, this can serve as a really positive model for how development assistance and how large-scale infrastructure projects can be implemented in a partnership that is largely the result of an internal domestic process. Don’t forget, Nepal requested the MCC project. The government of Nepal, through a consultative process, developed the idea, designed the project, and is now its lead implementer.We’re a financier and a partner but it is very much a Nepal-owned effort. Talking about challenges, there are many local governments and we have to deal with them every 10 to 15 kilometres in the project areas. Different communities have different concerns and priorities. This can add to some difficulty.What do you think will happen to the project if it cannot meet the five-year deadline?The fate of the project is to be completed in its entirety in five years. I can't speak to whether there’s going to be a particular challenge to delay it by six months or seven months or something like that. Right now, in our planning and projection, we hope that we can move it forward within the timeline.If it needs to go beyond that, we’ll work closely with our partner and figure it out. I’m confident that the $500 million that the US government is providing will be spent within the five years and it will lay a firm foundation for the completion of the project.But coming back to your scenario, indeed, you have different communities. A lot of people are affected by this. Now, on the one hand, that's why we encourage and insist on a consultative process, on everything being as transparent as possible so people know exactly what’s going to happen, that they know what the money is being spent on, what the effects will be in terms of how many trees will have to be cut down or what roads will be built where. That’s very important to us: no surprises for the communities that are out there.I think that we will rely on a lot of that effort to help us propel the project forward if things do get challenging on other fronts as well.Like you said, the project does need to be completed by a deadline of five years. Just in case it doesn’t, what happens?Look, it is an ambitious undertaking. There’s no question about it, right? And the Millennium Challenge Corporation is committed to making it happen within that five-year period. The MCA Nepal is committed to making it happen within that five-year period. But they’re also working closely together to make sure that it’s being done in a proper way, in a transparent way, and I’m confident that we will be able to complete what we need to complete. I’m also sure there’s a firm commitment from the government that if there’s a little piece left over here or there, to make sure it goes forward.I don’t worry about the ultimate completion of the project. I’m more focused on how we get it going as quickly as possible, because just the implementation of the project itself should employ close to 10,000 Nepalis, right? I really want communities to start to see the benefit of the project as soon as possible, because that’s where the transformative nature of it comes into play. Part of it is building it. Part of it is implementing it. Part of it is learning from that process. But then having this infrastructure in place, that’s what really changes the dynamic in Nepal and in the economic well-being of the country.Some fear that a failure to complete the project on time could even create rifts in our bilateral ties.I don’t think they should be fearful. We are partners in this, and if there’s any issue, if we're going to work through it together. What we should be doing is focusing entirely on implementing the project to its fullest potential as quickly as possible.Let’s move to geopolitics. What we see in the region is seemingly an exclusivist India-China geopolitical competition. Indians appear reluctant to work with the regimes that work closely with China. It's almost like they are saying, it's either the Chinese or us. How do you see this geopolitical dynamics playing out in Nepal? And where do the Americans fit in this picture?Yeah, it’s a good question in terms of the dynamic that’s in play today and where things are headed. We have of course been watching the India-China relationship and its development over the past few years with some degree of concern. Obviously, there was conflict there some years ago, and I think they’ve been trying to manage that since.And there’s no question that other countries in the region feel that very powerfully. From our standpoint, what we would like to see is the countries of the region—and particularly Nepal because that’s where I’m accredited and that’s where I have some level of knowledge—exercise their sovereignty and to have the space that they need to make decisions about they own future on behalf of their people in a positive way.We don’t believe countries should be asked to choose. We fully expect that Nepal is going to have good relations with India and China. They’re two neighbours. They’re large countries. They’re important countries in the region. It’s critically important for Nepal that it works with and benefits from both India and China.At the same time, we see no reason that should have any effect on our relationship with Nepal, and no reason Nepal should not be fully able to take full advantage of what the US has to offer. We will continue to watch and continue to work closely with Nepal as a partner and to encourage it to exercise its sovereignty and its decision-making in a way that benefits the Nepali people. The US-China relations are also very dicey at the moment. Surely this has some effect on how the US perceives the Chinese role around the world, including in Nepal.We had a recent high-level visit by our National Security Advisor [to China]. We’ve had recent visits by the Secretary of State, the Secretary of Commerce, the Secretary of Treasury. I think there’s a real effort to try to manage what we all acknowledge is as a competition that’s underway, in a way that’s positive and can maybe move us more towards some type of cooperative element.That channel should continue to be pursued by the US and China, but it’s not reflective of our relationship with Nepal, or our relationship with India. This is about what we can do together [with Nepal]. I’m not going to comment on what other countries may be saying about us, how they may be trying to influence us.I would commit to us remaining as transparent as possible so Nepalis can make their own decisions about what's happening by our relationship.Recently, the Americans were blamed for ousting Sheikh Hasina from Bangladesh. The US is also often accused of meddling in the domestic affairs of other South Asian states, and in other parts of the world for that matter. How do you respond to this accusation?First off, I think you’ve got to take with a grain of salt anything that’s being said by someone who’s been forced to flee their country. The United States simply does not meddle in the internal politics of other countries. We work very hard to be as transparent as we possibly can about our relationships, about what we’re doing, about what we intend.That’s not to say that if we disagree vehemently with a country about a certain policy or a certain issue, we won’t raise it. But this idea that the US would find some benefit in enacting a change in government like that, it simply isn’t part of our repertoire of diplomacy. What we rather look to do is build the strongest relationships that we can.We love to do that primarily through people-to-people relationships and sponsoring as much development opportunity as we possibly can with our partner countries. So, I put no stock in these types of rumours and statements.There is also this sentiment that the Americans and the Indians are increasingly working together on strategic issues, and the same is seen even in South Asia.Certainly, there’s been a huge growth in the strategic partnership between the US and India. I think we want to see that continue to move forward in a positive way. At the same time, there have been disagreements between the US and India on various fronts, just as we have disagreements with many of our partners. And we try to deal with those in a proactive, professional and productive way.But, again, we see our relationship with each individual country through a bilateral lens. So if there are ways that the US and India working together can be beneficial, and another country agrees to such a cooperation, fine. But when it comes to Nepal, we’re going to base our relationship and our efforts first and foremost on our bilateral discussions and our bilateral relationship.Even as we speak, the US and Nepali armies are undertaking joint training in Nepal. How would you characterise the relations between the two armies?Yeah, the PAC ANGEL exercise is going on, focused on disaster relief, humanitarian assistance. The relationship between the two militaries has been strong, it remains strong, and I think it will continue to be strong primarily because we focus it on the areas Nepal wants to focus on—which is building a Nepal army that is capable of responding to disasters, providing humanitarian assistance, and then serving as part of the global peacekeeping network through the United Nations as the largest contributor force of peacekeepers. It’s in our interest to see Nepal continue to professionalise and develop its capacity on those fronts. That’s where our focus is, and that’s where we will continue to make efforts.There has also been a lot of debate in Nepal on the Indo-Pacific Strategy (IPS) and its applicability to South Asia. What is the current state of its application?The Indo-Pacific Strategy is a broad, big strategy by the United States government about how it looks at the entire region. And so it’s about how we create an open, independent, sovereign Indo-Pacific region for the benefit of all the people in the region.What we will continue to do is employ it to build relationships we have with each of the countries in the region. How can we continue to support democratic development? How can we continue to support economic development? Let’s not forget a huge portion, maybe 60 percent of the world’s commerce transits the Indo-Pacific corridor in some way, shape, or form every year.It’s in everyone’s interest for that to remain open and free. And for the countries of the region to be able to act in a sovereign way in their own interests.There is also a sizable section of Nepalis who believe that the IPS was brought with the intent of countering China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), and that Nepal is struggling to find a balance between the two. What is your reading?The USAID, the MCC, the Development Finance Corporation, all of our development programmes have a singular purpose, which is to work with our bilateral partners to grow their economies, to make them more able to meet the needs of their people. That’s the goal. That's how they were designed. And that’s how we will continue to treat them.The BRI is China's initiative. It’s pushing that forward. It’s up to each country to decide how it wants to engage with others. We believe the model of, say, a USAID or an MCC is proving itself to be beneficial to countries, as they are grant-based and economic growth oriented. We’ll continue to push them because we think the data and historical experience we’ve had support them.I think it’s incumbent on us to try to help all of our partners relate to us as equals in any realm that we’re working together. That’s critically important and something we have to acknowledge and something we have to make sure that they’re able to acknowledge.It's about building trust, about showing that our intent is correct, that we have the best interest of our partners in mind, and that we’re applying the same and transparent standards universally.For example, on the MCC, we’ve published everything on the internet. If anybody in Nepal has a question about any aspect of the project, they can go to the website, they can read about the project, they can see the blueprints, they can know exactly what it’s going to involve. That's how I think we build relationships.I think if I came to Nepal and said, hey, I want to do X project because I want to counter this country, I don’t think I would get very good reception. We just don’t look at the world that way. It’s not a healthy approach in the long run.But a bilateral focus that seeks to empower the people of a country—that’s where I think we have the best chance of moving forward. Nepal’s Parliament has finally passed an amendment to the transitional justice law. How does the US see this development? How do you see the transitional justice process progressing?I think this is a really important step in the process. I would say that we remain positive about the way it's going and we are looking to see how we can help. You noted, I’m sure, that we joined a number of other partner countries in issuing a statement of support after the Parliament passed it.We all know bringing a conflict of this scale to conclusion is always going to be a challenge. The TJ legislation has passed, which was a tough hurdle, but implementation will also be difficult.We’re looking forward to figuring out how we can be supportive, and how other partners can be supportive. Some of that may be through bilateral means. Some of it may be through multilateral means.But what I remain encouraged about, in particular, is, we’ve always said this needs to be a Nepali-run process. It has been. That it needs to be victim-centric. I believe that it is. And so we need to make sure the consultative piece of this remains alive as you move to implementation, so that the victims groups, so that the child soldier groups, so that other entities that have been involved continue to have a voice and continue to work together to figure out how to resolve this, to make reparations work, to bring justice in those cases. And so, we are positive.Thousands of Nepali youths are leaving the country every single day in search of better jobs. In this light, do you see the prospect of greater American FDI helping Nepal build a more robust economy that can create enough good jobs?I do. At the beginning of the interview, I talked about some sectors of the economy that are quite exciting right now. I think you’re seeing a lot of interest from the US in the IT sector, the tourism sector, in the health sector, and in the energy sector as it continues to develop.We’re very keen to look for ways to bring more US investment here, whether it’s through equity sort of vehicles, or direct bilateral investments. I think that can also be positive. I think Nepal did a good job in setting up that April Investment Summit. That sent a really positive signal. You’ll recall that we had a representative from the US Chamber of Commerce, Atul Keshap, come out for that. We’ve had a great run of senior US visitors out here over the last year and a half.I think the key right now is for Nepal, through its private sector, through its government, to figure out how to make the environment for investment in Nepal as attractive as it can possibly be. In this interview, we’ve talked about the idea of competition between countries. One place where I will absolutely acknowledge there’s competition is in trying to attract investment.And so Nepal needs to figure out how to make itself as attractive as possible, and how to make it as easy as possible to do business. That helps not only investments that come from other countries, but makes it easier for Nepalis to start businesses, right? It makes it easier for Nepalis to operate and do what they want. And so, in addition to welcoming, say, US companies or British companies or Canadian companies, we would also love to see Nepalis who have gone abroad come back and start to help in building the economy here.We’ve seen how capable and how dynamic they are in building other people’s economies. Let’s do the same here at home.I mentioned that the trade and investment framework talks that we have with Nepal are in their seventh round. I look forward to, in the rest of my tenure here, to continue to build the momentum that will allow investment to take shape and the economy here to thrive. \nHere’s what Prime Minister KP Oli told the parliament on Monday, saying he was giving the address for a “special” reason: “Nepal wants to maintain neighbourly relations as a good neighbour, not a petty, scheming neighbour…Nepal wants a similar behaviour on the part of its neighbours.”He pursued this line of argument, implying that India is wishing ill on Nepal, imposing on Nepal’s sovereignty and interfering in its independent status and policy. He then told the parliament that he would present the issue at the United Nations General Assembly.It basically amounts to saying he will complain to the UN about India’s behaviour. What a petty idea.Given his inherent character trait, PM Oli will find it difficult to develop trusted relations with India in the short term. His only option is to be diplomatic, predictable and consistent. So far, he’s not been able to do that. It does not bode well for Nepal’s foreign policy, which is the most important means of pursuing Nepal’s current priorities, including jobs, growth and climate change.Calculated relations Oli’s statement in the parliament indicates at least three things. First, his expectations from India have not been fulfilled. Second, his communications with the country have broken down. And third, he thinks India may be working to undermine his political authority.Let’s look at his expectations from the southern neighbour. Oli wants to hold high-level talks with PM Modi of India and build trusted relations.In the past two weeks, media reports and opinion pieces have discussed whether Oli would be invited to India or not. It has almost become customary in Nepal for a new prime minister to visit India first before embarking on other high-level visits. Such a custom indicates the value politicians accord to India, especially if they want their government to be stable.The second indication is that Oli is finding it difficult to communicate with people who matter in India. When you begin to communicate your feelings about India through the media, it indicates that your direct communications have either broken down or are ineffective.Behind Oli’s statement is an obvious intention to play the blame game or rally the public. India may be at fault for many things, but blaming India does not absolve him of inconsistencies on his part or the sheer inability to conduct diplomacy in a dignified manner.The third indication is even more significant. Oli has consistently promoted anti-Indian nationalism, and India finds it difficult to trust him. But would that alone be enough to undermine his government?Throughout history, India has had a significant influence on Nepal’s political process and decision-making. Through its influence on individuals who’ve received gifts, benefits, and resources, some at the highest levels, India holds significant leverage over political decision-making and, by extension, over policies and processes.An old playbookIndia’s calculated relations with the Nepali state came to the fore in August this year when Foreign Minister Arzu Rana Deuba visited India. New Delhi turned her visit into a high-profile affair even though she was unprepared to represent Nepal’s interests. Her visit, rather than building political trust, ended up creating more mistrust between Oli and New Delhi as well as between the Foreign Ministry and the Prime Minister’s Office.Although it is a matter of speculation, there are strong grounds to argue that such a courtesy would not have been extended to someone from the CPN (UML). It generates the question, at least in the public’s mind, whether India accorded special treatment to FM Rana as a “special” individual who happened to be the foreign minister and not as a representative of Nepal.Whether real or not, the perception that India is unhappy with Oli has fuelled the notion that the current government coalition is unstable.Throughout Nepal’s modern history, whenever top leaders are forced out, they tend to seek India’s support to regain power. I have heard firsthand from top political leaders that India used to put a pre-condition: First, demonstrate that you have people's support, then we will use our leverage to help you. Thus, the political leaders would launch a political campaign and hold mass meetings throughout the country. If the broader political environment favoured a political change, then India made the additional push.Now, as Pushpa Kamal Dahal tours the country, blaming a corrupt network of power brokers, we are reminded of this old playbook. During mass meetings, an embittered Dahal frequently alleges that “middlemen, brokers, and big cronies have gotten together, and with the strength of so-called numbers, have tried to strangle truth, justice…and good governance.” He also tells the public that his government was ousted because the investigations on corruption were leading to Budhanilkantha (Deuba’s residence) and Balkot (Oli’s residence).Oli’s inherent anti-Indian streakFor Oli, an inherent anti-Indian streak in his psychological make-up and an affinity with the Communist Party of China makes rapprochement with India difficult.In the last 10 years, Oli has made countless petty statements intended to rile and irritate India. He has also accorded China greater space in Nepal.In his book, former deputy PM Kamal Thapa expresses distaste at the way Oli made an unscheduled visit to China Gezhouba Group Corporation and disappeared for one and a half hours for a private meeting with Chinese Communist Party officials during his visit to China in 2016.Another issue is the Eminent Persons’ Group report, which Oli raised during the launch of Thapa’s book. “It would be good to receive the report,” he said during the programme. He made more anti-Indian remarks at another similar event.At present, any talk of the EPG report is viewed as an irritant by India, because it has consistently sent a clear diplomatic message that the report is dead. The unwillingness of a section of the Nepali populace to accept the message, including the CPN-UML, has not gone well in India.In a recent discussion programme, a former ambassador of India to Nepal indicated that the EPG report had become a new irritant in Nepal-India relations. He said that instead of insisting on the acceptance of the report, Nepal could pursue the individual issues identified. Trends in the last two decades indicate that instead of really trying to address the outstanding issues in Nepal-India relations, Nepali leaders are just interested in politicising them and gaining personal mileage.Nepal’s relationship with India has become more and more of a paradox. Nepal’s dominant ethno-nationalism is anti-Indian. Indeed, Nepal has many unresolved issues with India, but it’s economic development hinges on closer connectivity with India, which in turn hinges on trusted political relationships and ability to untangle complex issues.Snubbed by India, Oli is now headed to the US, where he could still get to meet a lukewarm Modi. He hopes to gain stature and make an impression at several forums including the UNGA, where he is scheduled to deliver speeches. We can only wish our PM well. \nFive years ago, on September 30, 2019, when KP Sharma Oli was prime minister for the second time, the government declared the entire country open-defecation free amid much fanfare. However, years later, thousands of people from across the country are getting infected with diarrheal diseases, including scores from cholera.Rautahat is among the nine districts reporting cholera outbreaks this year. Ward 4 of Rajpur Municipality has reported over 100 cases of diarrheal infection and hospitalisation. However, the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division said only 12 people from the municipality had so far contracted cholera.“Over 100 diarrheal patients from the municipality’s ward 4 have been hospitalised,” Khusid Ahmad, a health worker at the municipality, told the Post over the phone from Rautahat. “Contaminated drinking water could be the culprit for the cholera outbreak there. Samples of drinking water collected from affected areas have been sent for lab tests.”Apart from Rautahat, eight other districts—Lalitpur, Kathmandu, Kailali, Pyuthan, Makawanpur, Rolpa, Sindhupalchok, and Achham—have also reported cholera outbreaks this year. So far, the number of diarrheal patients who have contracted cholera is 95. Interestingly, most of the districts that have witnessed outbreaks of deadly cholera this year had years ago been declared open defecation-free.The Vibrio cholera 01 Ogawa serotype has been confirmed in the stool samples of the infected patients. Doctors say that detected cases of cholera infection could be just the tip of the iceberg, as most positive cases are being reported from the districts with active surveillance.Public health experts say outbreaks of cholera in multiple districts, even five years after the country was declared open defecation-free, show a huge gap between official declarations and progress on the ground.They say outbreaks of diarrheal diseases, including cholera, are directly linked to drinking water, sanitation, and hygiene conditions, and the country was declared open defecation-free without improving water and sanitation conditions.“Without ensuring the quality of drinking water and sanitation, among other things, authorities rushed to declare the entire country free from open defecation,” said Dr Mingmar Gyelgen Sherpa, former director general at the Department of Health Services. “Instead of improving basic water and sanitation infrastructure, we’ve focussed too much on outbreak management, and this is the wrong approach.”Even though toilets have been built in most households, open defecation is still widespread in many places. Drinking water samples collected from various parts of the country, including from the districts of the Kathmandu Valley, have been found contaminated with faecal coliform, which means the water the public uses for drinking is unsafe. The presence of faecal coliform, a microscopic organism that thrives in the intestines of warm-blooded animals or their faeces, indicates sewage contamination in the drinking water, according to doctors.A previous study had shown that 81 percent of water samples collected in the Kathmandu Valley were contaminated with deadly microbes.“We only focussed on expanding coverage of drinking water but did not pay attention to ensuring its safety,” said Dr Meghnath Dhimal, chief researcher at the Nepal Health Research Council. “Authorities concerned must also focus on improving the quality.”Experts say improving public hygiene is essential to ensuring water quality and avoiding diarrheal ailments. Awareness drives and health education play a crucial role in changing behaviours, which requires years of investment and continuous efforts.Along with investment in health education, attention should go to building climate-resilient infrastructures for drinking water and sanitation, as water resources have been contaminated by floodwaters in many districts. The effects of climate change have increased adverse events, including floods, which in turn have contaminated the source of drinking water, making people vulnerable to infection with diarrheal ailments.“Multiple agencies of the three tiers of government and non-governmental sectors have to make more effort to prevent diarrhoea outbreaks,” said Sherpa. “But there seems to be a lack of coordination among government agencies.” The World Health Organisation also stresses on a multifaceted approach as a key to controlling cholera and reducing deaths. \n\n\nRae was the envoy to Kathmandu during the promulgation of the 2015 constitution and the subsequent blockade. In this conversation, Rae talks about the evolution of Nepal-India ties since the blockade, regional geopolitics, what the two countries get wrong about each other, how New Delhi views Nepali communist parties and the governments they lead, and the change (if any) in India’s neighbourhood policy since the start of Narendra Modi’s third term in office. \nKunwar has been the MD for just under three years. Before coming back to her homeland to join Daraz Nepal, she worked at different American companies, including Amazon, the world’s biggest e-commerce platform. In this conversation, Kunwar talks about the opportunities and challenges of running an e-commerce enterprise in Nepal, as well as the country’s overall business environment.  \nHindus throughout the country are observing the eighth and ninth days of the Bada Dasain festival today by worshipping Goddess Durga Bhawani.On eighth day, people offer special worship to the goddesses Mahakali, Mahalaxmi, and Maha Saraswati. This day of the Dasain festival is considered a special day when Goddess Durga attained power.On the occasion, people perform religious rituals at the Dasain Ghars and armories, worship the goddess at various shrines by offering animal sacrifices and read the Durga Saptashati scriptures.Devotees throng various goddess shrines in the Kathmandu Valley from early this morning to offer worship and sacrifice goats and ducks.Similarly, people throng the various goddess temples throughout the country today to offer worship, sacrificing goats, ducks, and roosters.Special Durgapuja worship and prayer ceremonies are held at the Dasain Ghars. People also worship the weapons, vehicles, and machines.People who do not sacrifice animals offer sacrifices of various vegetables and fruits in place of animals. Also on this day, a special Kalaratri worship is held at midnight at the Dashain Ghar of Hanumandhoka in the capital city. Mahanawami festival todayThe Mahanawami festival is being observed today with fervor worshipping goddess Durga Bhawani and making offerings. As per the lunar calendar, this festival is observed on the ninth day of the waxing moon in the month of Asoj. It is also marked as part of the 10-day Bada Dashain festival.Special worship is performed to Durga Bhawani today on the occasion of the Mahanawami and the 'jamara' which has been germinated is offered to the goddesses at various shrines. He-goats, ducks, roosters, and he-buffalos are sacrificed at the various temples dedicated to the goddesses. Those who do not have the tradition of offering animal or bird sacrifices, offer the sacrifice of fruits and vegetables to the goddess. The Durga Saptasati and Devi Strota scriptures are also recited at home and in temples on this day.As mentioned in the Markandeya Purana scripture, the Goddess Chamunda had slain the demon Raktabij on the day of Mahanawami. So, the special worship of the goddess on this day with the offering of animal sacrifices. On this day, the security forces also perform what is called the 'kot puja' or worship of the armories.The Taleju Temple located at Hanumandhoka in the capital is also open for the devotees to pay homage on this day. It is opened only on the occasion of the Mahanawami. The people of the Newar community also worship Bhimsen, a Hindu deity, by making animal sacrifices today on the occasion of Mahanawami.This time, the Maha Astami and the Mahanawami festivals fall on the same day. \nThe sacred Phulpati, an assortment of auspicious flowers, leaves, and plants for the Dashain festival, has been ceremoniously sent from the Kalika Temple at Gorkha Durbar to Hanuman Dhoka Durbar in Kathmandu. The Phulpati was officially dispatched on Thursday, following traditional rituals.Lok Prasad Bhattarai, a former employee of Gorkha Durbar and a priest of Dhungagadhe Bhagwati, carried the Phulpati to Kathmandu in a Ba 2 Jha 2128 vehicle. The departure from Gorkha was marked by traditional music, a decorated Phulpati palanquin, and joyous celebrations. The Phulpati from Gorkha Durbar is believed to increase the grandeur of Dashain in Kathmandu upon its arrival at Hanuman Dhoka, signaling the formal commencement of the festival.Preparations for the Phulpati dispatch began on Wednesday, the day of Shasthi. The head priest of the Kalika Temple, Sharda Prasad Bhattarai, mentioned that the process started with an invitation ritual at Piple in Gorkha Municipality-9.“The Phulpati collection process begins after a ritual offering to the gods by priests and assistants. The collected assortment includes Navapatrika, which is then sent to Kathmandu,” Bhattarai explained. He also mentioned that the Navapatrika is gathered from forest areas in Paslang, Reep, and Amarai around Gorkha. The tradition involves offering part of the Navapatrika at Gorkha Durbar, while the rest is dispatched to Hanuman Dhoka.According to local elders, the custom of offering Phulpati to both the ancestral deities of Gorkha and the newly established deities at Hanuman Dhoka was initiated by the Shah dynasty kings.It is said that Drabya Shah, the founder of the Shah dynasty, started the practice of offering Phulpati at Gorkha Durbar in 1616 BS. Later, after Prithvi Narayan Shah conquered Kathmandu, the tradition of sending Phulpati from Gorkha to Hanuman Dhoka began. “The practice of offering prayers at Hanuman Dhoka only starts after Phulpati arrives from Gorkha,” Bhattarai said. \nThe announcement by Min Bahadur Gurung, owner of the Bhatbhateni supermarket chain who was earlier jailed for misappropriating government property, to donate land and construct a building for the CPN-UML headquarters continues to stir controversy.On October 11th, Prime Minister and UML Chair KP Sharma Oli, in the presence of the party’s leaders, laid the foundation for the UML central office at Maitrinagar in ward 2 of Kirtipur Municipality. Gurung donated 10 ropani and 14 ana of land (0.55 hectares) for the UML’s party office. Not all UML leaders are satisfied with this decision, and a few have openly criticised the party chair’s decision to accept the donation. When Post talked to some party leaders about Gurung’s donation, most declined to comment openly but in private they expressed discontent. UML standing committee member Binda Pandey is one UML leader who has openly questioned the party’s decision to accept donations from the businessman. She has also argued that doing so would insult the 2.8 million voters and more than 550,000 party members.“It is wrong for a political party to accept such donations for building its party office, and it is equally wrong for a businessperson to offer such donations,” Pandey wrote on her social media. “The giving side might better know why and how they are offering such donation, but when it comes to the party, accepting such assistance, without informing discussing or deciding at the leadership level and without informing the party, could prove suicidal in the long run.”She also has urged the party leadership to reconsider the decision. However, Rajendra Gautam, the head of the party’s publicity department, said the party secretariat had decided to accept Gurung’s proposed donation of land for the party office, with Gurung himself covering construction costs.“Some of our party leaders may have been unaware of the party secretariat’s decision,” Gautam told the Post. “There is no harm in accepting a donation offered without bargaining.” The decision further aggravates public disenchantment with political parties and their leadership, say political experts, who also see a conflict of interest.They have raised concerns about how a party like the UML, currently in the government, can accept a donation from a businessman, whose case is still sub judice in court. But Gautam, the UML publicity department head, dismisses these concerns.“Until the court gives its final verdict, no one can be labelled a culprit,” Gautam said. In February last year, Gurung was sentenced to two years in prison for his involvement in the Lalita Niwas land case. He was also fined more than Rs8 million rupees. The Commission for the Investigation of Abuse of Authority also found that Gurung had made financial investments to acquire government land at Lalita Niwas, initially in someone else’s name and later in his own.A case was registered against 310 people for the embezzlement of 143 ropani of land (7.27 hectares) at Lalita Niwas. Gurung was arrested by the Central Investigation Bureau (CIB) of Nepal Police, accusing him of being the main planner of the scheme.At a public event, Oli accused the government of harboring malice toward Gurung.Gurung was released on bail from the land scam case in September of the same year. However, the CIB detained him again on charges of forging government documents, but he was again released soon. If such an incident, when political parties received donations from businessmen had occurred in any other civilised country, the party accepting the donation would have faced severe political consequences, says Keshav Dahal, a political expert.“When corruption becomes routine, political leaders cannot differentiate right from wrong,” Dahal told the Post. “The UML’s acceptance of Gurung’s donation is a form of corruption.” During the foundation stone-laying ceremony, Gurung told the media that is closely associated with the UML. Therefore, Gautam argues there was nothing wrong with accepting the donation from someone closely associated with the party.“Until and unless our party distorts the law of the land to favour Gurung’s business interests, there is no harm in accepting the donation,” Gautam reiterated.However, for political economists, a businessman donating to the ruling party in a country without specific laws raises moral concerns and presents a clear conflict of interest. To them, this incident is also indicative of the country’s unfair marketplace, where businessmen with political ties can do business on more favourable terms.“This is against the principles of a fair market economy,” political economist Bhim Bhurtel told the Post. “When the prime minister's name is linked to a businessman, that businessman will definitely receive direct or indirect benefits from state agencies, which will compel other businessmen to extend similar favours.” When one of the country’s biggest retailers has a nexus with the executive head of the state, state agencies may not be able to regulate that business, says Bhurtel.“This could also affect the price and quality of products sold by the retailer,” he added. \nChairman of the CPN (Maoist Centre) Pushpa Kamal Dahal who is also the opposition party leader, launches a broadside against the Nepali Congress, CPN-UML and former monarch all at once, stating that the formation of the government by two largest parties shows the country is heading towards a political crisis.The way the two largest political parties formed the government is a sign of political crisis, he said during an interaction with editors and reporters on Wednesday, adding that such incidents are rare in parliamentary democracy. Dahal, who was unseated by CPN-UML Chairman KP Oli in July second week, has been consistently attacking the CPN-UML.The CPN-UML withdrew support to Dahal's government in the second week of July and formed a new political alliance with the Nepali Congress which has irked Dahal ever since. The covert deal between UML's Oli and Nepali Congress chief Sher Bahadur Deuba paved the way for formation of a new government under Oli’s leadership, with Dahal relegated to opposition leader. Dahal has repeatedly blamed external and domestic forces for the fall of his government, and sometimes he claims that his anti-corruption drive was the reason behind its collapse. The Nepali Congress and CPN-UML not only decided to form a government jointly, but have also agreed to review the constitution. As per the July 1 agreement between Oli and Deuba, Oli will serve as prime minister for two years, and Deuba will succeed him.But Dahal and his party, the Maoist Centre, have taken a tough stance against revising some of the provisions of the constitution.Dahal on Wednesday squarely blamed the UML for standing against some of the key provisions of the constitution, particularly the republic.“The UML does not like the present constitution,” Dahal accused, adding, “So the UML wants to abrogate it.” This is probably the first time Dahal has made such a serious allegation against the UML. He, however, did not criticise the Nepali Congress much.“The UML also does not like inclusiveness, proportional representation and republicanism.”Dahal, during the interaction with journalists, claimed that Congress and UML are trying to abrogate the constitution. “They [Congress and UML] are hell bent on abrogating the constitution. Initially they were diplomatic, and used terms like ‘review’ and ‘revision’, but internally, they wanted to abrogate the present constitution,” said Dahal. Taking a jab at Oli, Dahal claimed that Oli’s repeated attempts to dissolve the parliament was part of a plan to undo the constitution, referring to Oli’s dissolution of the Parliament twice during his earlier term–2018 to 2022.Meanwhile, Congress and UML leaders have been claiming that they are committed to the current constitution, but believe some of the provisions should be reviewed, as they do not align with the expectations at the time of its promulgation in 2015. “They didn’t like inclusiveness, proportional representation, federalism and republic Nepal,” Dahal said, criticising the UML. However, Dahal himself has been mostly in power after 2015 with the support of either the Nepali Congress or UML. But critics say as long as Dahal was supported by the Congress and UML, he never noticed their opposition to federal, secular, republican Nepal.“We also want to review the constitution, but mainly to address the issues that have not been implemented yet,” he said, adding, “Our priority is not a review but the implementation of the constitution.”Dahal emphasised the need for laws including a federal civil service act, and provisions for setting up provincial police, among others. Time and again, various political parties and stakeholders have been raising these issues to strengthen federalism. During his interaction with journalists, Dahal also made a tall claim that major forces were trying to break up his party, the Maoist Centre. He did not name who those major forces are.The Maoist Centre has faced several splits in the past with senior leaders quitting to launch their own parties. The party is now undergoing internal struggle as senior leader Janardan Sharma has been questioning Dahal’s leadership. Dahal has been leading the party for over two decades.When asked to comment on the recent Bhutan visit of former king Gyanendra, Dahal said that there was no chance of restoration of monarchy in Nepal.The former king’s Bhutan visit reflects Nepal’s internal politics, but there is no chance of the monarchy’s return, he said. “I do not see that the king will return. I do not see that possibility. We have already moved from monarchy to republic. It is also impossible due to the actions of the former king and his family,” said Dahal.  \nThe CPN (Maoist Centre), which had earlier decided to contest elections alone, has now opted to partner with like-minded political parties other than the Nepali Congress and CPN-UML in the upcoming byelections slated for December 1.Issuing a circular on Monday, party chairman Pushpa Kamal Dahal and general secretary Dev Gurung informed the lower committees that the party has opened the door for forging electoral alliance with “progressive” and leftist parties except the Congress and the UML. On the byelections announced for December 1, the party will contest alone as far as possible and, if not, it will look to ally with “progressive” and leftist parties, the circular says.The Election Commission has already started the party registration process for the December by elections. As of Sunday, 25 political parties have registered with the commission, according to a statement issued by the commission. Previously, the Maoist Centre had decided to contest elections single-handedly. The two ruling parties Congress and UML, which are also the largest parties in Parliament, have already announced that they would not forge alliances for future elections and contest on their own strength. The Congress made this decision during the party’s Mahasamiti meeting as well as the central working committee. Likewise, a recent politburo meeting of the UML decided to contest the elections alone. The Maoist Centre circular is addressed to the party’s in-charges, district chairs and heads of provincial committees.For byelection preparations, the candidate selection for the vacant ward chair positions will be conducted through the gathering of the party’s registered ward members. The party will prioritise consensus in the selection, but if consensus cannot be reached, the candidates will be selected based on a majority vote and recommended to the municipality committee, where the final decision will be made by consensus. The Mahasamiti meeting of the Congress in February decided to contest the federal and provincial elections in 2027 single-handedly. Several top UML leaders, including party chair KP Sharma Oli and others, have also vowed to contest the elections alone. The Maoist Centre contested local, provincial, and federal elections in alliances with the UML in 2017 and the Congress in 2022. Since 2015, the Maoist Centre was continuously in power for nine years, partnering with the Congress or the UML. Maoist Centre chief Dahal was recently ousted from the prime ministership by Oli, who was appointed prime minister on July 14. The Maoist party was sidelined by the UML and the Congress after a series of political events.“We never declared our intent to contest elections alone but have opened the door for like-minded political parties to contest elections jointly,” a Maoist central committee member said. “Our maximum effort would be to contest elections single-handedly.” An office bearers meeting of the Maoist Centre, in July, concluded that the party would contest the upcoming elections on its own strength and also decided to rebuild the party and its organizations to make it enable to challenge the two largest parties. The opening of the door for alliances is also directed at joining hands with the parties under the umbrella of the Socialist Front, the Maoist leader said.“Most probably, we will forge such alliances with the parties that are associated with the front.” Besides the Maoist Centre, the front includes CPN (Unified Socialist), the Nepal Communist Party led by Netra Bikram Chand ‘Biplav’, and the Nepal Socialist Party headed by Mahindra Raya Yadav. As per the election schedule, the nomination of candidates will take place on November 17 from 10 am to 5 pm at the office of the electoral officer. A preliminary list of candidates will be published from 5 to 6 pm on the same day. Any objections or complaints against the listed candidates can be lodged on November 18, between 10 am and 3 pm. The verification and decision on the nominations and complaints will be carried out on November 18 and 19, and the final list of candidates will be published by 6 pm on November 19. Likewise, candidates can withdraw their nominations on November 20, between 9 am and 1 pm. The final list of candidates will be published from 1 to 3 pm the same day, followed by the allocation of election symbols between 3 and 5 pm. Voting will take place on December 1, from 7 am to 5 pm, at designated polling stations, according to the Election Commission. The electoral body has also announced a 48-hour silence period, starting from midnight on November 28, during which election campaigning will be prohibited. The election authority had earlier announced that there are 41 vacant positions, including two district coordination committee chiefs, two chairs, four vice-chairs, and 10 ward chairs of rural municipalities, as well as one mayor, one deputy mayor, and 21 ward chairs of municipalities. Previously, the commission conducted by-elections for the House of Representatives in Bara-2, Chitwan-2, and Tanahun-1 on April 23, 2023, and for Ilam Constituency-2 on April 27, 2024. The provincial assembly election in Bajhang (A) was also held on April 27. \nThe Nepali Congress is holding a ‘100-day campaign’ to rejuvenate party committees, strengthen the bond between the party's local representatives and central leaders, and pacify the party's dissenters.The party’s central committee meeting, which concluded on September 1, decided to run the 100-day campaign from September 23 to December 31. Krishna Prasad Paudel, chief secretary at the party office, says many central leaders have already reached the districts they are assigned to run campaign activities.According to Paudel, the party’s seven joint general secretaries lead the campaign in the seven provinces. Senior leaders Krishna Sitaula, Shashank Koirala, Bimalendra Nidhi, and Bijaya Kumar Gachhadar, along with some central committee leaders, have either reached the assigned districts or are on the way, Paudel said.“When the party’s senior leaders and central committee members are in their districts, vice presidents and general secretaries of the party will monitor the campaign activities,” Paudel told the Post. “If necessary, the vice presidents, the general secretaries, and the party president will go to some districts.”One of the main objectives of the campaign is to renew party membership. “We claim our party has 0.9 million members,” Paudel said. “During the campaign, leaders will check the trend of party members renewing their membership.”The campaign has been launched at a time when leaders have already started to devise their plans for the next general convention. As per the Congress statute, the party must hold its general convention every four years. The party’s 14th general convention was held in December 2021. If the statute is followed, the party’s next convention should be convened by the end of 2025.Some Congress leaders have floated the proposal of contesting the next general election on its own, without forging electoral alliance with other parties. General Secretary Gagan Thapa floated a proposal to this effect at the Mahasamiti meeting in February that forwarded the proposal to the central committee to take a decision on the issue.“If we are to fight elections on our own [without an alliance], we need a strong organisation, therefore the party is emphasising strengthening the party by conducting campaigns,” Paudel told the Post.But, for the party leaders, success of the campaign will largely depend on the way it will be run.“Will the party leaders try to connect the party organisation to the public or will they conduct it in just a traditional manner? This will determine the success of the campaign,” Guru Ghimire, a Congress leader, told the Post.Ghimire suggested that the party leaders should also gauge the strengths and weaknesses of other parties in the districts.Ghimire also advised the leaders not to use the campaign as an opportunity to promote factional activities.When public disenchantment towards the major parties is growing fast, the campaign the Congress has decided to carry forward could be a means to connect the leaders with the public, says a Congress leader.“This campaign will re-energise the relations between the party and the public, and the party should work hard to make this event fruitful without baggage of internal factions,” Sanjay Kumar Gautam, a Congress lawmaker, told the Post.Reconnecting with the public is a compulsion for the political parties, say political experts. Soon after the November 2022 election, major political parties including the Congress held several campaigns to reconnect with the people but the masses may not be quite impressed by the leaders’ announcements they make during the rallies unless they deliver when in power. Earlier, the CPN-UML carried out various drives such as ‘mission grassroots’, a march along Mid-Hill Highway. “Political parties’ efforts to get connected with the people is something commendable in itself,” Geja Sharma Wagle, a political analyst close to the Congress, told the Post. “But, if the political parties don’t deliver while they are in government, people might not be convinced by their pledges.”Wagle adds that as the Congress is in government, people take the leaders’ speeches seriously only if they work for them sincerely.During the 100-day campaign, the party has decided to inform the party members and local leaders regarding the seven-point agreement reached between the Congress and the CPN-UML on July 1. Based on the same agreement, the two parties formed the coalition government led by UML chair KP Sharma Oli on July 15. As per the deal, Oli will hand over the government leadership to Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba after two years.Besides their power-sharing in the federal government, the Congress and the UML have shared powers in provincial governments as well. While Koshi, Lumbini and Karnali provincial governments are led by the UML, Congress provincial lawmakers head Bagmati, Gandaki, and Sudurpaschim governments. The two big parties have backed Janamat Party to head the provincial government in Madhesh.During a meeting of the coalition partners held in Singha Durbar on September 9, Prime Minister Oli had reportedly complained that the coalition partners did not work enough to counter the ‘disinformation campaign of the opposition parties’ against the Oli government. “The opposition has spread confusion about the government, but the parties in government have not shown any interest in countering the disinformation,” the prime minister had reportedly said at the meeting. “All the ruling partners should defend the government.”Congress leaders will inform the party’s district representatives about the spirit of collaboration with the UML, constitutional amendments, and other issues. They are also responsible for informing the party members at the grassroots about policies such as the common minimum programme.Earlier this month, the Congress-UML coalition brought the programme that has, among other things, reiterated its commitment to reviewing the achievements made and weaknesses observed in the course of implementing the constitution in the past nine years. \nAfter being ousted from government for the first time in nine years, the CPN (Maoist Centre) appears to be at a turning point as it seeks to redefine its vision of socialism. In the wake of consultative meetings in seven provinces and its foreign units, party leaders have stressed the need for fresh ideas based on the party’s historic Chunwang meeting of 2005 that adopted ‘democratic republicanism’.Until this July, the party has continuously been in power since the promulgation of the constitution in 2015. Back during the insurgency days, the meeting held at Chunwang in Rukum district had endorsed the party’s political line advocating for promulgating a constitution through a constituent assembly. On this basis, the party in 2006 signed the Comprehensive Peace Accord with the then seven-party alliance and laid down arms to enter mainstream politics.The 2015 constitution envisions Nepal as a socialism-oriented country, with the Maoist Centre playing a key role in shaping that direction. But why, after all these years, is the party revisiting the question of socialism?Maoist Centre spokesman, Agni Sapkota, argues that the party has been discussing socialism in various forums. “But this time, we want a more intense and focussed discussion.” Tensions within the party also came to light during the party’s standing committee meeting in August where office bearers openly questioned the leadership of Pushpa Kamal Dahal. In response, the party decided to hold consultative meetings in all provinces to discuss the matter. Besides the provincial meetings, the party also consulted its foreign branches known as ‘pradesh committees’ in India, West Asia, and Eurasia.According to Sapkota, the Maoist Centre leadership got three mandates at the consultative meetings that concluded on September 20.“Besides the need for discussion on party ideology, the consultative meetings’ mandates include improving organisational management and updating party statute, changing leaders’ behaviour, and improving their secretariat work,” Sapkota told the Post. Likewise, another party leader, Dor Prasad Upadhyaya, says democratic socialism naturally aligns with the ideology of the Nepali Congress, whereas ‘people’s multiparty democracy’ is the ideology of the CPN-UML. “As for the Maoist Center, we lack a distinct political ideology clearly reflecting the party’s vision.”Although the party claims its ideology is ‘people’s democracy of the 21st century’, party leaders admit that its impact is diluted by lack of commitment. Party leaders said that there was no call for a leadership change during the consultative meetings. However, at the standing committee meeting in August, a deputy general secretary of the party, Janardan Sharma, submitted a 14-page document calling for a change in party leadership.Sharma and Barsha Man Pun—another deputy general secretary of the Maoist party—urged Dahal to pass over party reins to new generation leaders. According to leaders, some within the party feel that Dahal should not leave a leadership vacuum until a clear plan for leadership transition is in place.Likewise, Ram Karki, the party’s secretary, says the consultative meetings were focussed at preparing a political document that would be presented at the central committee meeting in November. “The consultative meetings were focused on the party’s diminishing influence in national politics,” Karki told the Post. “Despite our party leaders who were in government claiming that they did an excellent job, why hasn’t that reflected in the party’s life? This was a major concern expressed during the meetings.”Karki said the meeting also directed the party to remain open for cooperation with other parties with socialist inclinations. When asked about possible cooperation with the Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP), Karki dismissed the idea. “Lately, there have been some points of agreement between the two parties. But, I don’t see any prospect of the two parties getting into a working partnership,” Karki said. “The consultative meetings have said the party leadership is open to cooperation with socialist parties except the RSP.”The RSP—which was one of the junior partners in the immediate past government led by Maoist Centre chief Dahal before the government was toppled on July 12—appears to be on the same page with the Maoist Centre on many issues lately. But the two parties rule out cooperation on the political front.Party spokesperson Sapkota also says that his party can cooperate with the RSP in parliament on issues of public interest, but there is no possibility of forging a working alliance with the party. RSP chair Rabi Lamichhane, who presented his political document at the party's first national conference held for two days in Kathmandu earlier this month, also hinted at potential cooperation with like-minded parties. Despite this, RSP leaders declined cooperation with the Maoist Centre. The Maoist Centre’s consultative meetings have suggested that the party consider unification with other parties in order to revitalise the communist movement, Sapkota added.  \nTicket bookings for public transport during the Dashain festival will open this Saturday. Following discussions with stakeholders, the Department of Transport Management announced that tickets will be available online and at counters to manage the expected surge of nearly two million travellers leaving the Kathmandu Valley for the festivities.According to the department’s Director General, Rajiv Pokharel, transport operators will facilitate online bookings. “We have instructed operators to arrange online bookings wherever possible,” he said. “For counter bookings, passengers must obtain tickets only from official staff wearing uniforms and identification badges.”Around two million people are estimated to leave the Kathmandu Valley during Dashain. The department has introduced 20-point directives to ensure safe and hassle-free travel. Key measures include mandatory checks for alcohol consumption by drivers at major entry and exit points and the requirement for two drivers on long-distance routes. Additionally, those under 18 cannot work as assistant drivers.To assist travellers during Dashain, Tihar, and Chhath festivals, citizen help desks will be established at major locations such as Nagdhunga, Kalanki, Swayambhu, Halchowk, Machhapokhari, Gongabu Bus Park, Chabahil, Tilganga, Koteshwar, Jagati, Satdobato, Balkhu, Dakshinkali, Sundhara, and Sangha in Kavre. An inspection team comprising officials from various agencies will monitor travel arrangements with support from provincial transport ministries.Public transport operating on long and medium-distance routes must follow a designated queue system. Transport expert Ashish Gajurel noted that although bookings are open each year, passengers face difficulties. \"Bus operators don’t increase the number of buses during Dashain, despite rising demand. Authorities must increase the number of buses to ease travel,\" he said.Saroj Sitaula, senior vice-president of the Federation of Nepalese National Transport Entrepreneurs, however, argued that ‘unnecessary’ vehicle checks should be avoided to prevent inconvenience for passengers and drivers. He also highlighted the need to repair potholes on roads to ensure smooth travel.Earlier, Minister for Physical Infrastructure and Transport Devendra Dahal instructed the Department of Roads to complete road repairs nationwide before Ghatasthapana, the first day of the 15-day Dashain festival. The department reported that repairs are underway but have been delayed by the monsoon.The Narayanghat-Butwal road section, part of the East-West Highway, remains a major concern, with only 52.7 percent of its upgrade completed after six years of construction and multiple deadline extensions. The Meteorological Forecasting Division of the Department of Hydrology and Meteorology has predicted chances of rainfall in various places of the country for a couple of days more, raising concerns about travel difficulties during Dashain. Other problematic sections include Nagdhunga-Mugling and Mugling-Pokhara, with landslides and potholes reported along various highways, including the Mid-Hill, Madan Bhandari, Hulaki, and BP highways. \nPanic gripped locals in ward 12 of Chandragiri Municipality, Kathmandu, on Thursday morning after a suspicious object was found in the locality.The suspicious object was spotted in front of Balambu Secondary School, sparking fears of a bomb threat.Locals informed the police, and a bomb disposal team from the Nepal Army arrived at the scene. According to the NA Directorate of Public Relations and Information, the team disposed of the suspicious object, which turned out to be a pressure cooker.   \nKathmandu Metropolitan City has extended the area to prohibit building any structure on either side of the rivers in its territory.In a notice on Wednesday, the city office stated that construction of any structure has been barred on the additional 20 meters from the existing prohibited area.According to the metropolis notice, if the city has, under the existing rule, prohibited any construction on 20 meters from the area marked as river, the prohibited area will now be altogether 40 meters on either side of the waterway.The metropolis said the decision was taken based on a recent Supreme Court verdict that directed the authorities concerned to prohibit construction within an additional 20 metres from riverbanks in the Kathmandu Valley.Currently, construction is permitted only 20 metres beyond major riverbanks in the Kathmandu metropolis.The notice issued by the metropolis states, “No construction will be permitted on an additional 20 metres of land on either side of the river, and ongoing construction will be halted.”It has also asked one and all not to release contaminated water, including sewage, into Bagmati River and its tributaries. “Private and government buildings, as well as commercial properties, must install soak pits for groundwater recharge,” it said. “Waste must not be disposed of in the rivers. Non-compliance will lead to legal action under existing laws.” \nThe rhythmic beat of the Dha echoes through a Bhaktapur alley, blending with the energetic footsteps of dancers. Bhaktapur, which sees jatras and festivals round the year, is no stranger to music, dance and celebrations. But this is not an ordinary occasion. The performers in question are Lakhe dancers who are reviving the Ranjitkar Lakhe dance after a century.The young dancers are preparing for Indra Jatra this year, where mask-clad Lakhe dancers roam the streets to rid the community of hardships and suffering. Lakhe, demon deities revered as protectors of people and crops, are thought to reside in the demonic mask. As the dancer dons the mask, the spirit is said to take over.Bhaktapur was once a key site for the Ranjitkar Lakhe performances, but the art form vanished from the city after the 1934 earthquake.“Bhaktapur suffered the most damage during the 1934 earthquake,\" says Ganesh Ram Ranjit, treasurer of the Ranjitkar Group’s Bhaktapur branch. “The destruction left residents struggling to recover for a decade, making it nearly impossible to perform the costly Lakhe dance.”The Ranjitkar Group discovered the extinct dance in the year the group was established. They located a Lakhe temple in Bhaktapur that had closed after the earthquake. After two years of research, they learned that performing the Lakhe dance was seen as a good omen in Bhaktapur and involved hosting community feasts. However, the high cost of this tradition forced many to sell their properties, rendering it unfeasible in the city’s post-earthquake conditions. Over time, the dance was abandoned as more lands supporting these cultural events were lost during rapid urbanisation.“There was a significant decline in our engagement with our cultural heritage,” says Rabi Shakya, a sculptor and Lakhe dance teacher training the new dancers. “The encouraging change now is the strong interest from the new generation, which is making it possible to revive intangible heritage like this dance.”After 100 years, the Ranjitkar Lakhe Dance is making a return to Bhaktapur at this year’s Indra Jatra.“It’s challenging to accurately re-enact the dance since it hasn’t been seen in a century,” Shakya notes. “As a sculptor, I drew inspiration from Bhaktapur’s revered Shree Navadurga Bhawani to create the Lakhe’s mask.” Similarly, the dance was choreographed by studying Lakhe dances from Kathmandu, Patan, and Banepa within the Ranjitkar community, and combining them with traditional steps from Bhaktapur Lakhe dances.“As for the musical instruments, we are using traditional instruments like Dha, Dhime, and Ponga, which are said to excite the Lakhe,” says Rajendra Maharjan, Lakhe dance teacher and musician.Maharjan is one of the experienced Newari arts teachers working to revive the lost Lakhe dance. He is involved in training young students in cultural arts and is now dedicated to the Ranjitkar dance training, with the students practising together nearly every day.“Becoming a Lakhe performer involves more than just wearing the costume and mask,” said Sudin Ranjit, a Lakhe dance student. “We must train extensively with our teachers, and it demands a lot of hard work.”To Ranjit, a resident of Bhaktapur, the training is more than learning a new craft; it is a matter of protecting culture. Growing up only interested in instruments, he slowly understood how important continuing cultural practices like Lakhe dances is for their community.“The dance will not only bolster Bhaktapur’s cultural pride but also boost tourism and create jobs,” says Dr Purushottam Lochan Shrestha, a professor and researcher specialising in Bhaktapur and Newari culture.Shrestha notes that reviving the dance would offer employment to everyone involved, from the dancers and the sculptor making the masks to those participating in the rituals. “Economic centres throughout the city, from small businesses to large industries, will benefit from the influx of tourists attracted by the Lakhe dance,” Shrestha adds, commending the Ranjitkar group's initiative.Once the Ranjitkar community revitalises the Lakhe dance, the Ranjitkar group plans to set up a new Guthi house with a fresh community fund and organise annual events for the dance.“The Lakhe dance won’t let them separate,” Shakya remarks.In today’s globalised world, where identity often merges into a homogenised blend, shared cultural practices provide a sense of connection and belonging. This new Lakhe dance embodies that spirit of togetherness for the community involved.“Reviving the dance after 100 years,” Shakya says, “is about preserving our culture for the next 300 years.” \nThe Lions Club of Kathmandu Corporate, Nepal MD325-D has felicitated various personalities as part of its endeavour to recognise the contribution of the individuals and business entities for the society.As part of its campaign, the Lions Club of Kathmandu honoured Prateek Pradhan with Social Journalism Award, Sylapa T Rimponche with Social Spiritual Award, Erika Gurung with Social Player Award, Ramesh Corporation with Social Corporate House Award, Rajendra Malla with Social Corporate Leader Award and Rajesh Hamal with Social Celebrity Award.Likewise, Chandra Ghimire is honoured with Social Bureaucratic Award, Binod Das with Sports Management Award, Anil Kedia with Social Academic Award, Mohan Ojha with Social Management Award and Surya Nepal with Corporate Social Responsibility Award.The Lionism embarked in Nepal in 1971 as the Lions Club of Biratnagar under the stewardship of former Prime Minister Matrika Prasad Koirala.The Lions Clubs International says it has over 2,000 clubs operating across the nation. \nThe much-delayed Dodhara Chandani dry port and check post project in farwestern Nepal has finally moved ahead after the provincial cabinet approved the use of forest land to build the facility.The Rs15 billion project is located in Dodhara Chandani Municipality, Kanchanpur district, and is listed by the government as a national priority project.In 2023, the government approved the project's environmental impact assessment (EIA) report.On September 18, the provincial cabinet gave permission to the Nepal Intermodal Transport Development Board to use 43 hectares of Mayapuri community forest in the buffer zone of Suklaphanta National Park, clearing the last major hurdle for the project.Once completed, the dry port is expected to boost the Nepal-India trade and help drive industrial development in the western region.Dodhara Chandani dry port will be the first business gateway to India from Nepal's farwest. The site is 245 km from India’s capital, New Delhi and 1,200 km from Gujarat state. Officials said the dry port will facilitate trade with other Indian states like Rajasthan, Uttarakhand, Punjab, and Haryana. It will also provide Nepal access to India’s largest seaport, Jawaharlal Nehru Port in Mumbai, enhance Nepal's foreign trade, and reduce costs.According to Nepali officials, transporting goods to Nepal through these routes will result in substantial savings.Most of Nepal's trade infrastructure is concentrated in the east, connecting to Kolkata port. Officials say the construction of a dry port in Sudurpaschim province may open up access to more Indian ports in the future.The project is also expected to reduce transportation costs and shorten the time required to import goods from India.Dodhara Chandani inland container depot will feature administrative buildings, customs office, banks, quarantine facilities, staff quarters, warehouses, and parking spaces.As per the master plan, the depot will eventually accommodate 3,000 20-foot freight trucks, although in the first phase will provide space for 300 trucks.The import warehouse will span 7,000 square metres, and the export warehouse will cover 2,520 square metres. The railway warehouse will be spread over 17,500 square metres, and the container stacking yard, a large open space for container movement, will cover 10,000 square metres.In the project's second phase, 126 hectares will be developed for additional warehouses and parking areas.A decade and a half ago, the World Bank conducted a feasibility study for the proposed dry port at Kanjabhoj in Dodhara Chandani Municipality, and the Nepal Intermodal Transport Development Board prepared another report in 2016. \"The cabinet has granted permission to the Nepal Intermodal Transport Development Board to use the land. With this approval, groundwork will begin within the next three months,\" said Ashish Gajurel, the board's executive director. \"We will now start cutting down the trees.\"He said that the national park has written to them to find land in other areas as compensation. \"If we can’t find suitable land, we will have to provide cash compensation equal to the value of the land.\"Gajurel said that they plan to open an office after the Dashain festival to begin work. \"We will clear the site to create a working environment for the Indian side and write to them to immediately begin the tender process and other related tasks,\" he said.According to the EIA, a total of 15,057 trees need to be felled. As per the Forest Clearance Guidelines, ten compensatory trees must be planted for every tree cut for development projects. Project officials say that 150,525 compensatory trees will need to be planted.Gajurel said they need to cut down 1,700 trees immediately, which they have already marked for removal.The dry port will be built under an Indian grant.According to the project, the transshipment centre will be constructed in two phases, and the first phase is estimated to cost Rs8 billion. Dodhara Chandani dry port will be located on the border with India. A twin dry port will be built on the Indian side in Banbasa.The first phase will be linked by road, while the second phase will be linked by rail. The completion deadline is three years from the start of construction.Work has already started on a Rs3.2 billion access road on the Indian side that will connect to Dodhara Chandani. The Indian government is building the access road.Three years ago, the government had decided to constrruct the facility in ward 1 of Chandani Municipality. However, following protests by local residents in Kanjabjoj, which is in ward 8 and was originally planned site, the project was relocated. Last year, during then-Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal's visit to India, it was agreed that the facility would be built by the Indian government.A four-lane bridge over the Mahakali River has been built, and an 8-km access road on the Nepal side between Gaddachauki and Malariya river in ward 1 of Dodhara Chandani.The dry port is expected to boost Nepal-India trade and contribute to industrial development in the western region. According to Nepali officials, transporting goods to Nepal through these routes will result in substantial savings. \nNepal has imported playing cards worth Rs61.1 million in just the first two months of the current fiscal year, according to data from the Department of Customs. The demand for playing cards, particularly high during the festive seasons like Dashain and Tihar, has driven significant imports from countries such as China, India, the US, and the UK.A total of 2,007,892 decks of playing cards were brought into the country during this period, generating Rs35.2 million in revenue for the government. Playing cards are widely used for leisure activities, and also in gambling practices during Nepal’s major festivals.In comparison, Rs64.4 million worth of playing cards were imported during the same two months last fiscal year, yielding Rs40.4 million in revenue. The data also shows that China was the largest exporter of playing cards to Nepal, contributing Rs52.1 million of the total imports this year, followed by India at Rs9 million.Last fiscal year (FY 2023/24), Nepal imported playing cards worth Rs321.8 million, with China and India being the major sources, contributing Rs282.3 million and Rs 26.8 million, respectively. Smaller quantities were also imported from countries like the US and Spain.In the previous fiscal year (2022/23), playing card imports stood at Rs 212.7 million, with Rs 187.6 million worth imported from China, Rs 21.5 million from India, and Rs 3.5 million from Brazil.The rising import figures suggest a steady demand for playing cards in Nepal, particularly during the festive seasons, with millions being spent annually on their procurement from international markets. \nWhiteflies have affected more than 100 hectares of paddy fields in Palpa, in western Nepal, reducing the crop yield by two thirds.The whiteflies (Aleurocybotus indicus) have been affecting the crop since August.In many parts of Palpa, like Rampur, Nisdi, Madi, and Tinau, the district's food basket, farmers are worried about their income this year.Yubaraj Adhikari, a farmer of Rampur Municipality, said his paddy, planted on 0.5 hectares, has been severely affected. \"The plant turned red from green.\"He said the flies had attacked the paddy during the flowering stage, which means the plants still stand but will not bear kernels. A typical rice kernel is 6–10 mm long. Farmers say rice kernel will be halved even in some areas where there is some recovery.\"Based on the plant's growth, I initially expected to harvest 2 tonnes of rice. Now, it is difficult to expect even 500 kilograms.\"Farmers said hectares of rice were affected—about 70 percent potentially damaged. The government authority, however, said they are yet to do the damage assessment.Adults are tiny (about 1 to 1.5 mm) white-winged insects. The wings cover the entire body. A single whitefly can lay up to 200 eggs; if not promptly addressed, the rice will turn reddish about a week after the eggs are laid.Palpa has been witnessing a series of pest attacks, which experts say may be due to the change in the climate pattern.According to the National Climate Change Survey 2022, released by the National Statistics Office, formerly the Central Bureau of Statistics, in May, over the past 25 years, approximately 50 percent of households surveyed reported the emergence of new diseases in their crops.Similarly, 53.9 percent observed the presence of new insects or pests affecting their crops, and 29.8 percent of households noted the appearance of new diseases in their livestock.Agriculture is the mainstay of Nepal's economy. It contributes 24.6 percent to the country's GDP and employs over half of its population.In Palpa, three years ago, an insect known as hopper—plant feeders that suck plant sap from grass, shrubs or trees—infected a large swathe of farmland in Madi, Rampur, Argali and Kachal.Shanti Dotel of Rampur municipality has no hopes of making income from the paddy this year.“The whiteflies have attacked the paddy field. It has turned red,\" she said.Madi and Tinau are the most affected areas.Yam Bahadur Chidi, chairman of Mathagadi rural municipality, said they had received complaints from farmers about the crop damage. \"The pest attacked the crop during the flowering period, which will significantly affect the output.\"\"The yield will drop,\" said Mani Ram Adhikari, another farmer of Rampur Municipality-6. Farmers said that among several varieties, the high-yielding Sabitri is mainly affected by whiteflies.Rampur has been affected by the whiteflies for the last three years, and the flies are gradually invading other areas. The municipality said that whiteflies have been reported since August, mainly in four wards—4, 5, 6 and 7.The municipality even launched a pesticide spray programme, but to no avail. Shanti Dotel, a farmer of Rampur municipality-6, said she chose to plant an improved variety of paddy to get a larger yield, but the situation changed. \"It looks like the straw will also not work.\"She said the pest attack was mostly seen on the hybrid varieties and nominally affected the local varieties.\"It has mostly affected the variety Sabitri,\" said Narayan Prasad Gaire, chief of the agriculture section of Rampur Municipality. “We have even distributed pesticides to the farmers. In some places, we have observed some regeneration in plants.\"Palpa has 8,210 hectares of paddy fields, and hybrid types have been proliferating. \n\nWith the federal government slashing the budget of the nutrition programme, the distribution of fortified flour has been halted in all five districts of Karnali Province since the start of the ongoing fiscal year.Officials admit that the progress in improving nutrition in Karnali Province, achieved through years of efforts and investment, may have been jeopardised due to the suspension of the programme.“Thousands of pregnant women, new mothers, and young children have been deprived of fortified flour, which was crucial in reducing severe malnutrition among these,” said Lila Bikram Thapa, chief of the Nutrition Section at the Family Welfare Division under the Department of Health Services. “The provincial government has started providing Rs2,500 to new mothers, but there is no support for improving the nutrition of young children.”Malnutrition is a silent crisis in Nepal. The country has made significant progress in reducing stunting among children under five. Stunting decreased from 57 percent in 2001 to 25 percent in 2022, according to a report of the Nepal Demographic and Health Survey-2022.Likewise, wasting declined to eight percent from 10 percent in 2016. Wasting or low weight for a particular height is an undernutrition condition, which is a strong predictor of mortality among children under five, according to the World Health Organisation. Wasting in children is associated with a higher risk of death if not treated properly, according to it.Even though the survey report showed some improvement in the country’s overall nutrition status, progress is not the same in all provinces. The problem is more prevalent in the Karnali Province. According to the report, over 30 percent of children under five in the province are stunted, the highest in the country, which is an indicator of chronic undernutrition. The province is also the poorest and most food insecure compared to the national average.According to officials, as part of a super flour distribution programme launched in 2014, the government used to provide three kg of flour—fortified with all necessary micronutrients—to pregnant women, new mothers, and children aged six to 24 months every month to address chronic malnutrition problems in the province. For that, the Health Ministry used to allocate Rs 50 million. “This year, around Rs100 million has been cut from the nutrition programme budget and this is the main reason for the stoppage of the fortified flour distribution programme ” said Thapa. “Besides halting the flour distribution, the budget cut will also impact awareness programmes, which are crucial for reducing the burden of problems.”Nutrition experts warn that slashing Karnali Province's nutrition budget will have long-term consequences and could jeopardise the decades of progress in the sector.They say that authorities concerned should have promoted locally available foods, made people aware of the importance of nutritious foods and provided fortified flour to improve nutrition conditions and lessen dependency on freely distributed foods.They say that health authorities must continue awareness programmes to educate people about the importance of healthy food and what they have been providing.Doctors say malnutrition during pregnancy increases the risk of complications and maternal and neonatal deaths, as well as the likelihood of low birth weight. It is a major impediment to growth, affecting human capital and economic productivity.Experts say that nutrition has a direct link with the overall development of the country.They add that malnutrition affects children's physical and mental growth, ultimately affecting the country’s economic health.The Health Ministry had sought help from the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) to address the growing problems of malnutrition in Lumbini, Karnali, and Sudurpaschim provinces in the past.According to Thapa, the federal government has not renewed its contract with the World Food Programme, which provided logistic support for the fortified flour distribution programme.“This year, the government neither has renewed its agreement with the WFP (World Food Programme) nor allocated a budget for continuing the fortified flour distribution programme,” said Thapa.  \nSave the Children Nepal has launched a pilot initiative of introducing ‘rainbow kits’ specifically designed for transgender individuals impacted by disasters.The initiative aims to ensure that transgender people have dignified access to essential hygiene materials during times of humanitarian crisis.The rainbow kits break traditional gender binary norms by addressing the specific needs of the transgender community during humanitarian disasters, such as the recent flood and landslides in Nepal.“The rainbow kits are a response to the limitations of conventional humanitarian dignity and hygiene kits, which often fail to meet the needs of the LGBTQI+ population,” said Tara Chettry, country director for Save the Children in Nepal and Bhutan. “As diversity and inclusivity remain at the heart of Save the Children’s organisational values, I believe this initiative broadens our approach to humanitarian response, encouraging us to view aid through a more targeted and inclusive lens rather than a one-size-fits-all solution.”The kits were officially handed over to the Blue Diamond Society (BDS), a pioneering organisation working for the rights of LGBTQI+ individuals in Nepal. The BDS will distribute these essential kits to those affected by recent floods and landslides, ensuring that the specific hygiene needs of the LGBTQI+ community are met.The rainbow kit includes a carefully curated selection of items designed by Save the Children and the BDS to support health, dignity, and comfort, including condoms and lubricants, sanitary pads/menstrual cups/tampons, wipes, dry tissues, V-wash, panty liners, hot water bags, menstrual panty (free size), towel, hand sanitiser, toothpaste and brush, soap, masks, and other essential items.Tailored kits promote inclusivity and ensure that all identities are recognised and respected, regardless of their sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression and sex characteristics, said Manisha Dhakal, executive director of Blue Diamond Society. \nAmid the risk of a sharp rise in dengue cases in the coming days, the Ministry of Health and Population is gearing up to purchase rapid diagnostic test kits.Officials admit that they have only around 2,000 kits in stock, which is insufficient to carry out daily testing if cases spike.“We have decided to purchase rapid diagnostic test kits worth Rs 1 million immediately for dengue testing,” said Dr Bikash Devkota, director general at the Department of Health Services. “We have also asked health agencies under provincial governments to purchase rapid diagnostic test kits on their own.”Officials admit that the risk of an exponential rise in dengue cases has increased as the post-monsoon season, which is considered the peak dengue season, has just started, and the rainfall has not stopped. The recent disasters, which killed hundreds and displaced thousands, have also increased the risk of a surge in infections, experts say.At least 246 people have been confirmed dead, while 19 others are still missing following floods and landslides triggered by record-breaking rainfall some 10 days ago. As many as 173 people have been injured, and more than 17,120 others were shifted to safety, according to Nepal Police. “The risk of dengue infection has increased, as hundreds of displaced people are now living in temporary shelters, where water, sanitation and hygiene conditions have been compromised,” said Devkota. “Stored drinking water in these shelters could turn into breeding grounds for mosquitoes, the dengue vectors. We have alerted our health officials accordingly and asked them to launch an awareness drive in the high-risk areas.”Dengue is a mosquito-borne disease transmitted by female Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes. The same vector also transmits chikungunya, yellow fever, and Zika viruses, according to the World Health Organisation.At least seven deaths and 14,975 infections have been reported from 76 of 77 districts across the country since the start of monsoon this year. Experts say reported dengue cases could be just the tip of the iceberg, as around 90 percent of the infected people do not show any symptoms.Health officials say that they have communicated to provincial health authorities to prepare for a possible surge in dengue cases in the coming days. But provincial health authorities have instead asked the federal government agency to purchase testing kits and supply them to the provinces.“Some provincial health authorities have asked us to purchase dengue testing kits and supply them,” said Dr Yadu Chandra Ghimire, director of the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division. “But it is not possible for the federal government to purchase testing kits, which are required in huge quantities, due to budget constraints.” Since there is no specific treatment for dengue, health workers provide symptomatic care and diagnose patients based on symptoms.Of late, a surge in dengue cases has caused a critical shortage of blood in the Kathmandu Valley. The Central Blood Transfusion Service (blood bank) said that hospitals in the Valley have been facing a surge in demand for platelet-rich plasma and platelet concentrate due to the surge in dengue cases.“The daily demand for blood and blood components is about 400 pints, but we have only been able to collect about 100 pints,” said Sanjeev Kumar Yadav, senior technical officer at the Central Blood Transfusion Service. “We urge everyone eligible to step forward and donate blood. We have been struggling to meet the demand, and families of critically ill patients are in a difficult situation as they can’t find blood.”Officials attributed last week’s monsoon disaster and the start of the Dashain holidays to the decline in blood collection. They say the closure of colleges for the Dashain holidays, along with many offices and organisations suspending blood donation campaigns due to the festival, has led to a sharp drop in donations.According to doctors, mild to high fever, severe muscle pain, rashes, severe headache, and pain in the eyes are some symptoms of dengue.The World Health Organisation (WHO) says there is no specific treatment for severe dengue, but early detection and access to proper medical care can save lives.Dengue is a mosquito-borne viral disease transmitted by female Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes. The same vector also transmits chikungunya, yellow fever, and Zika, according to the WHO. \nRam Prasad Koirala, a resident of Nalagaun in Belkotgadhi Municipality, Nuwakot, spent all of Thursday racing around Kathmandu and Bhaktapur, desperately searching for platelets for his 13-year-old son, who has been infected with dengue.Doctors at the Maharajgunj-based Tribhuvan University Teaching Hospital, where his son is being treated, told Koirala to get platelets as his son’s platelet count had dropped to a dangerously low count of 13,000 per microlitre of blood. A healthy count ranges from 150,000 to 450,000 platelets a microlitre.“The doctors have asked me to arrange six pints of platelets, but I could manage only one pint,” a frustrated Koirala told the Post. “I spent the whole day visiting several blood banks across Kathmandu and Bhaktapur, but still couldn’t find donors.”This was a common refrain among many relatives of seriously ailing dengue patients who had come to the Central Blood Transfusion Service (blood bank) in search of platelets, as hospitals in the Valley have been reporting a surge in dengue cases.Officials at the central blood bank said that the demand for platelet-rich plasma and platelet concentrate has tripled compared to the usual daily collection.“Demand for blood and blood components is about 400 pints a day, but we have been able to collect only around 100 pints,” said Sanjeev Kumar Yadav, senior technical officer at the Central Blood Transfusion Service. “We urge everyone eligible to step forward and donate blood. We have been struggling to meet the demand, and families of critically ill patients are in a difficult situation as they can’t find blood.”Officials attributed last week’s monsoon disaster and the start of the Dashain holidays to the decline in blood collection. They say the closure of colleges for the Dashain holidays, along with many offices and organisations suspending blood donation campaigns due to the festival, has led to a sharp drop in donations.“We are ready to travel to Nuwakot, Dhading and other adjoining districts of the Valley to collect blood, as we have no other option for saving lives,” said Yadav. “Relatives of patients, especially those with dengue, have been waiting at the blood bank round the clock.”Officials at the blood bank are worried about a severe blood shortage, as colleges will not reopen until after the Chhath festival (first week of November), and many people will soon be leaving the Valley. They said there is already a daily demand for over 100 pints of platelet-rich plasma and platelet concentrate for dengue patients. As a single patient requires multiple pints, they lament that it is impossible to meet the demand at the current collection rate.“We have also sought help from mainstream as well as social media for blood donations,” said Yadav.Dengue is a mosquito-borne disease transmitted by female Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes. The same vector also transmits chikungunya, yellow fever, and Zika viruses, according to the World Health Organisation.At least seven deaths and 14,975 infections have been reported from 76 of 77 districts across the country. Experts say reported dengue cases could be just the tip of the iceberg, as around 90 percent of the infected people do not show any symptoms.The post-monsoon period is considered a high transmission season for dengue, but Nepal has witnessed outbreaks of the deadly disease since the beginning of the year and across the pre-monsoon, monsoon, and post-monsoon seasons.According to doctors, mild to high fever, severe muscle pain, rashes, severe headache, and pain in the eyes are some symptoms of dengue.The World Health Organisation says there is no specific treatment for severe dengue, but early detection and access to proper medical care can save lives. \nConcerns are growing about a possible rise in home deliveries in several districts after road links were disrupted last week’s devastating floods and landslides.Officials at the Ministry of Health and Population said that they are aware of the growing risk and have instructed agencies concerned to start risk mapping.“The risk of home deliveries has grown due to last week’s monsoon havoc,” said Dr Bikash Devkota, director general at the Department of Health Services. “We have instructed agencies concerned to monitor the situation and report back. We also held discussions with our development partners about the risks and requested them for help.”At least 233 people have been confirmed dead, while 22 others are still missing in the floods and landslides triggered by record-breaking precipitation in three days starting Thursday evening last week. As many as 169 people have been injured, and more than 17,120 others were shifted to safety, according to Nepal Police. Transport links to many districts have been disrupted by the floods and landslides that swept the roads and bridges in many places. Health facilities and birthing centres in many places were also destroyed in the disaster.Maternal health experts say that the recent disaster could cause a severe setback to maternal and child health and also affect institutional delivery rate.“Due to the disruption in vehicular movements, many pregnant women may not be able to reach birthing centres,” said Nisha Joshi, a public health official at the Family Welfare Division under the Department of Health Services. “Pregnant women and new mothers who have lost family members or property in the disasters would be unable to reach hospitals or health facilities for childbirth.”Health officials say that they have cautioned health workers in the affected areas about the heightened risk of an increase in home deliveries, which increases the risk of maternal and newborn deaths.A report on maternal mortality carried out by the National Statistics Office in 2021 showed that for every 100,000 live births, 151 women still died from maternity-related complications. Similarly, the institutional delivery rate has reached around 80 percent. Maternal death rate and home delivery rate are very high in remote areas. “We are aware of the risk of a rise in home deliveries, which poses a threat to the health of mothers and their newborn,” said Joshi. “We have requested the United Nations Population Fund and Nepal Red Cross Society to distribute warm clothes to 12 new mothers in the Nakkhu area of Lalitpur, who are taking refuge in makeshift shelters.”Maternal health experts say expecting mothers may face difficulties in attending regular checkups during pregnancy, which could put both their lives and babies at risk. Along with a potential drop in institutional deliveries, the number of antenatal and postnatal visits could also decline due to the impact of the disaster, according to them.With the government announcing free institutional delivery service in 2009 at all state-run health facilities, more than 2,800 birthing centres were set up across the country. The institutional delivery rate, which was around 18 percent then, has now increased to an average of around 80 percent across the country. The health ministry also provides travel allowances for antenatal care visits, offers skilled birth attendant (SBA) training to staff nurses, and hires them at birthing centres to help prevent deaths during or after childbirth.Nepal had cut the maternal mortality rate from 539 per 100,000 births in 1996 to 239 per 100,000 births in 2016—for which the country even received a Millennium Development Goals award.In the last fiscal year, at least 190 women from 51 districts died of complications during childbirth, data provided by the health ministry shows.The actual number of maternal deaths due to birth-related complications could be much higher, as maternal and perinatal death surveillance is being carried out in 51 districts only, officials say.Nepal’s target under the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals is to reduce the maternal mortality rate to 75 per 100,000 births by 2030. \nDusit Princess Kathmandu hosts a five-day trout festival from 12:30 pm to 10:00 pm till August 30, showcasing 12 unique trout dishes featuring flavors from around the world.\nInspired by baking shows, a young baker overcomes mishaps and masters techniques through scientific analysis, emphasizing the importance of precision, patience, and embracing the journey.\nAfter the Stonewall Riots in 1969, queer individuals who faced discrimination and violence found refuge at the Inclusive Galaxy Restaurant in Kathmandu, where they can now express themselves freely, connect with their community, and support each other.\nAditya Mishra, a Nepali chef in New York City, promotes Nepali cuisine through his supper club \"The Sewing Tin\" and incorporates traditional dishes like kachaila into his menu, while also facing criticism for blending Nepali food with modern styles and highlighting the challenges faced by restaurant owners in Nepal.\nCeleus Baral, an environmental science student, launched Bakeleus, an online baking shop featuring jams, tarts, cakes, cookies, and brownies, utilizing produce she grows and experimenting with creativity and zero-waste practices.\nKhokana, a historic village near Kathmandu, preserves ancient architecture, mustard oil mills, and traditional rituals like the Sikali Jatra, providing a glimpse into the Valley's past amidst urban expansion.\n“How much oxygen do you have for the summit?”I think this is the kind of question a film producer would ask. But when you're on the mountain, the answer is never clear.I have worked for a long time in the film industry and different art areas, especially photography and engraving.Working in various fields and drawing inspiration from them has become a new normal for me. I have made this approach my way of life without even realising it.I took responsibility for producing the last movie I worked on and shot the behind-the-scenes footage for a documentary. By doing so, I witnessed the entire shooting process and the journey of a movie.In the snowy highlands of Turkey, we had to endure the consequences of the changing climate to shoot ‘About Dry Grasses’, directed by Nuri Bilge Ceylan. The highlands used to be snowy in January, but by the time we got there in the same month, there was no snow. Nature was changing. It was responding to what was happening—to what humanity had done to it. In the end, it snowed, and we shot the intense snow scenes we wanted. But since most of our days were sunny, unlike what the director wanted, we had to shoot in the sunset and sunrise hours. As crew members, we spent many days waiting for the sun to set.Production requires creating opportunities, finding solutions, and being creative for a work of art to come true. For this, patience, endurance, calmness, and timing are necessary. On the other hand, nature wanted us to listen to it and wait for the right time.During that time, I witnessed many of nature's lessons. For example, I experienced extreme cold for the first time. We endured temperatures ranging from -33 degrees to +55 degrees. By listening to nature, surrendering to its forces, and working within its limits, we managed to persevere.No matter how much you prepare or plan during the pre-production phase, if you are working in nature, remember that nature will always have the final say.The film was completed, released, and connected with audiences. Its success at Cannes 2023 was followed by my trip to the North Pole for my project. I returned with a mix of wonderful developments, joys, and challenges. During this process, I experienced life and death, happiness and sadness, losses and awards.I realised the value of being able to breathe comfortably a few days after my father's chemotherapy ended. Just a few days earlier, he had said, \"Well done, my daughter. I'm glad you went!\" All the anxiety and hard work, filled with fears at the beginning, were finally behind me.Before going to Everest, when I was on the verge of giving up, defeated by my fears, I remembered my father's words. Everest reminded me of what he said while struggling to breathe, adding a turning point to my life.What does it mean to say ‘life’s turning point?’ How many turning points can there be in life?Who am I, and what am I doing in this world? How well do I know my own limits? Can I find answers to these big questions? These thoughts sparked my dream of journeying to Everest. Now, after returning, I can say that it turned my life around.“How much oxygen do you need for the summit?” sounds more like “How much do you need to hold on to life?” How many reasons do you find that give meaning to your life, keep you alive, and allow you to breathe? How much can you endure in the face of obstacles, and can you keep believing that a solution will eventually come your way?Can these questions be separated from the idea of measuring and assessing something, from learning its quantity and financial value? Can everything be known with certainty? Should the journey be fully understood in advance, with all its promises laid out? Should it be viewed like a purchase with a price tag, asking, “Is this journey worth this much?”I had never trekked before and had no climbing experience. I had lived at sea level my entire life and had never been to a high altitude.However, this journey was not only about the physical climb but also an inner discovery. After losing my father to lung cancer, his breathing difficulties taught me the fragility of breath, life, and existence. I also mentally prepared myself for the physical challenges I might face. Despite all my concerns, could this journey help me understand the cycle of life and the resilience of the soul?So, how could I make this trek possible? How could I land in Nepal? Despite all the economic difficulties and the many things I felt needed organising, I did my best and believed in it.Since I was embarking on this journey, I felt I should share about my travels and inspire others.Starting with photography, cinema, and engraving, which are already integral parts of my life, I dreamed of documenting and sharing the inspiring aspects of this journey.After months of correspondence and dreaming, it all came true. Finally, I embarked on the journey with the goal of creating photographs, engravings, and documentaries. I learned a great deal from my travels in Nepal, from the people I met, and from every moments I witnessed. I felt incredibly fortunate to have been able to honour my father’s memory with the peace and serenity I experienced in the Himalayas.During my 15-day journey to Everest Base Camp, I encountered nature’s masterpieces at every turn. As concerns like “How will I endure?” and “How will I finish?” started to weigh on me, the mountains suddenly parted with the clouds and gazed down at me.It was amazing to witness the appearance of ‘Gods’ that I had never seen before, in such immense size and in such a close, awe-inspiring manner beside me during that silent walk.As someone who came from one of the most crowded cities in the world, Istanbul, while I struggled with my daily questions and uncertainties, trying to control everything, they stood there calmly, as if answering me.They were just there—before and after.My guide, Lakhpa Sherpa, always reminded me not to worry about how high we were, how long it would take to reach our accommodation, or what the weather would be like. He encouraged me to live in the moment, and he was right.He advised me to focus on my breathing, not to get thirsty, to eat enough, and to appreciate the extraordinary beauty of the journey. In the mountains, plans dissolve and each moment is embraced as it comes.All the good wishes, prayers, and everything encountered along the way were for the journey itself. The mountain was full of life, secrets, and everything I had wondered about.This 15-day journey to Everest Base Camp was a solo adventure, yet I wouldn't have been able to complete it without my guide, Lhakpa, and my porter. Additionally, I was fortunate enough to experience the hospitality, generosity, and honesty at Trekkers Paradise, which organised the entire journey and provided guidance.I witnessed how dedication and sincerity are crucial in completing a journey safely and healthily. Ghanshyam Sharma, from Trekkers Paradise and Sauraj Jhingan, a climber who summited the Everest in 2018, shared their experiences with me during the journey.They experienced the 2015 earthquake while they were at the Everest Base Camp.As a filmmaker, their role as actors, and attention to detail played a significant role in bringing my dream photography and documentary project to life.The sponsors of my journey were Turkish Airlines, The North Face, Apple, Canon, and Stanley. My supporters include Oscar International College and Nepal Film Campus. Throughout the journey, I shared many experiences, memories, and countless photos and images with my students.On my way back home after 21 days, I celebrated my birthday on the plane. From the right window, the Himalayas bid me farewell. I felt like I had opened a new chapter in my life, and I was certain that I would return.I had made many friends and memories in Nepal.For now, I will be working on a documentary and preparing for a photography and engraving exhibition titled ‘My Soul Beyond the Mountain’.To the Himalayas: This summer was spent with you, but we will meet again soon. \nWe spent five days in Sri Lanka two weeks ago, driving up and down the island, covering almost 70 percent of its territory. Our tour spanned over 1,000 kilometres, including hills, beach spots, and heritage and religious sites.Our first stop in Sri Lanka was Colombo’s Bandaranaike International Airport. We were greeted by a warm and humid breeze when we exited the airport. The host briefed us (a group of journalists) that heavy rainfall has affected areas across Sri Lanka since mid-May 2024. Rain and storms intensified on June 1, with the most significant effects in the south and west of the country. We were lucky to have no rain in the forecast.On the first night, we checked into the lavish Jetwing Lake resort, an opulent sanctuary amidst the lush landscape. The resort’s expansive grounds were a retreat, offering a glimpse of Sri Lanka's natural beauty. We feasted on delicious cuisine, every bite exploding with flavour, introducing us to the island’s famed culinary delights. On June 7, early morning, the sun shone brightly, previewing the promise of an incredible journey ahead. We set off early the following day, eager to explore the mysteries of this enchanting island. As we ventured further into the heart of Sri Lanka, the landscape revealed its majestic nature. We were astounded by seeing Pidurangala Rock, a 200-metre-high granite colossus just a kilometre north of Sigiriya. The short hike to Pidurangala Rock offered breathtaking views of Sigiriya and beyond. We climbed the steep steps and soon were rewarded with a breathtaking panoramic view of the surrounding landscape. It took us 30 minutes to climb. The sight took our breaths away and left us humbled in the presence of such grandeur. From the top are glorious vistas of the surrounding landscape and an incredible view of the majestic Sigiriya Rock. From there, Sigiriya Lion’s Rock is visible, standing alone. This was the place where demon king Ravana had his palace in the Treta Yuga. Believed to have been built 50 centuries ago, the palace is said to have had a unique lift for Ravana and his visitors. Ravana imprisoned Sita in one of the caves at the bottom of this humongous boulder. Sigiriya is a fifth-century fortress in Sri Lanka carved out of an inselberg, a hill of hard volcanic rock that soared high above the surrounding jungle. We spent two hours atop the rock, mainly taking photographs. We descended from Pidurangala Rock, filled with awe and a sense of accomplishment.The journey ahead seemed even more enticing as we ventured along the winding roads, heading towards our next destination.Cash-strapped Sri Lanka plunged into its worst financial crisis in more than seven decades in 2022, with a severe dollar shortage sending inflation soaring to a high of 70 percent, its currency to record lows, and its economy contracting 7.3 percent.Thanks to the growing number of tourists, Sri Lanka is now bouncing back.In Jetwing Lake, we met Kasun Pradeep Somasiri, a receptionist. He briefed us that the resort is now 50 percent occupied. “That’s a better figure now as we are recovering.”The travel and tourism sector is a significant income generator for Sri Lanka. However, the economic crisis, the Ukraine–Russia war, and China’s zero-Covid policy have jeopardised the industry.Tourism accounted for more than 12 percent of the country’s GDP in 2019 and was the third-largest source of foreign exchange reserves, behind worker remittances and the apparel industry.Sri Lanka was poised to be one of the world’s best holiday destinations due to its rich culture, wealth of natural resources, and diversity of accessible experiences.However, tourism-dependent Sri Lanka suffered its first major setback with the Easter bombings 2019. This led to the collapse of inbound tourism flows as international arrivals declined by 18 percent year-on-year, and tourist expenditure fell by 17.7 percent that year. This was immediately followed by two years of pandemic restrictions. Inbound visitors fell to just 116,600 in 2021.An acute balance of payments crisis forced Sri Lanka to preemptively default on foreign debt of over $50 billion in April 2022, triggering a crippling economic contraction with spiralling inflation.“Tourism is gaining momentum,” says Somasiri. “The British and Chinese have started to return to Sri Lanka.”January-August is the peak season for foreigners. “From December to April, local people travel for holiday purposes,” says Somasiri. Before we started the tour to other religious sites, our tour guide, Sampath Mayadunne, told us, “Don't take selfies with your back to Buddha.” Turning your back on a Buddha statue and some other religious sites to take photos and videos is a strict no-no.The most common sight across Sri Lanka is the tank cascades system, an ancient irrigation infrastructure. The system is a network of small tanks draining to large reservoirs that store rainwater and surface runoff for later use.“These infrastructures were built by its ancient kings over 2,000 years ago to solve the water scarcity in the country’s dry zone,” says Mayadunne.On day two, we travelled to Ranweli Spice Garden in Matale. This garden is famous for its rare spices and herbs. A tour of the gardens will show you the cultivation, harvesting, cleaning, and packaging process, as well as the health benefits and uses of the herbs.On the way, we saw a colourful Muthumariamman Hindu temple, boasting hundreds of detailed sculptures in a rich mosaic of colour.In Kandy, we visited the Temple of the Tooth Relic (Sri Dalada Maligawa), one of the most sacred places of worship in the Buddhist world. It was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1988.The temple sustained damage from bombings by Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna in 1989 and by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam in 1998. However, it was fully restored each time.We then headed to Jetwing St Andrew’s, a luxurious 5-star property in Sri Lanka’s hill country of Nuwara Eliya, situated at 1,900 metres above sea level. During our stay in Kandy, we immersed ourselves in the city's charm and the serenity of the countryside. On the third day, early morning, we travelled to Nuwara Eliya, the area famous for tea estates that give many Nepalis the feeling that they have come to Kanyam, Ilam, in eastern Nepal.We visited a tea factory called Damro Labookellie Tea Centre, the oldest tea centre in Sri Lanka. Due to its cold climate, it is the most important area for tea production in Sri Lanka.In this tea factory, they make white and black tea, while the green tea is processed in another tea factory and then sent to Damro.After the tea factory tour and the tea tasting, we headed to Galle, our next resting point.We encountered narrow, winding, and maze-like streets and alleys in Nuwara Eliya, known as ‘Little England’. The town has preserved almost all its British-era buildings and is calm and beautiful. On our way to Galle, at the roadside, our tour guide stopped us at the famed Sita temple, which has Hanuman's footprints and is the place where Sita, wife of Lord Rama, was held captive by the demon king Ravana after he abducted her from India.We were at Sita Eliya, a temple named Sri Seethai Amman.When we reached the Hindu temple, rich in vibrant colours and architectural elements, it was full of devotees. The water stream adjoining the temple is believed to be where Sita bathed. Large footprints are found on the stones in the stream, and there is a saying that those belong to Hanuman, who came spying to find Sita’s whereabouts.In Ella, Ravana’s waterfalls are significant in the Rama-Ravana story. The cascade charms visitors from all over the globe. The waterfall is easily accessible and is known to have hidden caves at the top, which are believed to have been used as Ravana's residence.The 25-metre-tall waterfall is a beautiful cascade that provides the perfect backdrop for a photo to remember your Ramayana trail adventures in Sri Lanka. A short pilgrimage tour ended there, and it was now time for an adventure. Though it was not part of our itinerary, our guide decided to tour us on a train ride.Though short, only six kilometres from Ella to Demodera, it was thrilling. Everyone screamed in unison like kids on a fair ride to hear the echoes in the dark every time we passed through the tunnels. The sound of the train is subtly different inside a tunnel. For the first-timer, the darkness and shouts inside the tunnels when the train passes would be scary, like a horror movie.The train we boarded wasn’t crowded, but people had already filled the doorway, ready for the scenic journey.With the shrill sound of a whistle, the train slowly pulled away from the platform at Ella, passing houses, coconut trees and green fields.As the train progressed, tourists and locals were leaning out the windows and crowding to hang out the doors. I joined the crowd and hung out on a train. A short excitement ended there.After lunch, we headed to Galle and reached Jetwing Lighthouse. As soon as our group entered the hotel, they shouted with excitement.The hotel is on a rocky outcrop three miles west of Galle. Waves crash over giant boulders in front of it and produce howling winds.We were at Galle’s 17th-century fort five minutes from the hotel on day four. In the Bay of Galle on the southwest coast of Sri Lanka, Galle Fort was built first in 1588 by the Portuguese and lavishly rebuilt by the Dutch during the 17th century. It is a historical, archaeological and architectural heritage monument that maintains a perfect appearance even after more than 436 years.We then reached Hikkaduwa Beach, a popular beach destination on the southern coast of Sri Lanka. On the way, we saw a 30-metre-high Big Buddha Statue. It is a replica of the 6th-century Buddhas of Bamiyan destroyed by the Taliban in Afghanistan. It was created using the earliest known sketches of the statue. It was built in remembrance of the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami victims.We then travelled through the 222-kilometre-long Southern Expressway, Sri Lanka's first expressway linking the capital, Colombo, with Galle, Matara, and Hambantota, significant cities south of the island.On day five, we reached Colombo, the capital of Sri Lanka. Jetwing Colombo Seven hosted us in the bustling capital. We took a city tour early morning and visited Bally's Casino at night.On day six, we returned to Kathmandu early in the morning on a Sri Lankan Airlines flight, the airline that organised the trip in coordination with Jetwing Hotels Limited, a Sri Lankan hotel chain.National flag carrier Nepal Airlines, in its previous avatar as Royal Nepal Airlines, used to operate direct flights to Colombo during the 1980s. However, the carrier suspended operations following an armed movement by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) in Sri Lanka. There had been no direct air links between the two countries for decades.In 2016, Himalaya Airlines started a chartered flight that lasted a few months due to low traffic movement between the two countries. Sri Lankan Airlines started operating direct flights to Kathmandu in August 2021.“The main objective of this media tour is to increase tourism in both countries for mutual benefit. We want to draw Nepalis for pilgrims and leisure activities,” says Nilina Pathirana, Country Manager at Srilankan Airlines in Nepal.“We have understood that Nepali travellers tend to travel to Bangkok, Vietnam, Malaysia, Dubai, and Maldives. Nepalis have quite minimal knowledge about Sri Lanka and the religious connection between Lanka and Nepal. We want to promote Nepal and Sri Lanka jointly. This will be a win-win business,” added Pathirana.The airline said it currently carries 60 percent of the passengers from Nepal to Sri Lanka and beyond destinations like Tokyo, Sydney, Melbourne, and other Middle Eastern destinations. The return airfare for a 3.5-hour-long flight starts at Rs74,000. “We have a four-night, five-day package that begins from Rs80,000, depending on the properties and extended itineraries,” says Pathirana.Nepalis must submit certain required documents for visa processing, like their passport copy and bank statement. Due to this government-to-government policy, only Nepalis must obtain a prior visa. Otherwise, Sri Lankans are required to have a visa upon arrival.“The other best thing is that Sri Lankan Airlines can be involved with the visa process or facilitate the Nepalis tourists. Our main intention is to have a sustainable market in Kathmandu and make it a daily flight,” says Pathirana. \nMundhum Trek in Koshi province in the eastern part of Nepal is a new cultural walking trail. It passes through several indigenous ethnic villages and landscapes in Khotang and Bhojpur districts. This trail goes up to an elevation of 4,200 metres to the viewpoint of Silchung Peak and takes one through the settlements of the Kirati people. This route starts from Diktel Bazaar and passes through beautiful settlements like Chakhewa, Rawa Dhap, Salpa Bhanjyang, Silchung and Hanspokhari before ending in Bhojpur. There are some hotels in Diktel but trekkers are advised to carry tents. The trail offers panoramic views of most of the eight-thousanders, including Everest, Lhotse, Makalu, Cho Oyu and Kanchenjunga mountains. The spring season, March through May, is highly recommended for the trek.Janaki Mandir Janaki Mandir at Janakpur in Madhesh province was constructed in 1874 and is a blend of Mughal and local architecture. The temple is a three-storey building and has 60 rooms, making it the largest temple in Nepal. Pilgrims flock here by the thousands to pay homage to Janaki Mandir—Janaki being the other name of Sita, the daughter of King Janak. The temple houses an idol of Sita which was found near Ayodhya, the kingdom of Ram. The marriage anniversary of Lord Ram and Sita is celebrated in Janakpur every year on Vivaha Panchami, which falls in December. In the southwest corner of Janaki Mandir is the Vivaha Mandap, which has been built at the site where the marriage of Ram and Sita is said to have taken place. Another well-known temple in the vicinity is Ram Mandir, which is built in pagoda style and is hence different from the other temples in Janakpur that generally bear resemblance to Mughal architecture. It houses a female statue, said to be of Yogamaya, which has the reputation of being one of the most beautiful images of female forms in Nepal. Other holy sites of interest include the Laxman Temple, Sankat Mochan Temple and Hanuman Temple.Kuri Village, Kalinchok Kuri village, a popular tourist destination around 150 km from Kathmandu, lies at an altitude of 3,842 metres above sea level in Kalinchowk of Dolakha district, in Bagmati province. People visit the place to enjoy the snow during the winter besides the mesmerising landscapes and splendid panoramic view of the Himalayan range. Kalinchok gets snow mainly at the end of December and the snowfall continues till the end of February or mid-March. When there is snow, it is difficult for jeeps, buses and cars to reach the top of Kuri village. Chains are wrapped around the wheels of vehicles and specially modified jeeps with highly experienced drivers are used to carry visitors. There are several hotels and restaurants in the area. The road up to Kuri has also improved over the years.Annapurna Base Camp Annapurna Base Camp trek, in Gandaki province, makes for a picturesque journey that takes you to the foothills of the Annapurna South, up to 4,130 metres above sea level. The five-day trek (seven days for slow walkers) offers rich cultural diversities, typical Nepali villages and the flora and fauna nestled at the foothills of Annapurna. The distance from Pokhara to Annapurna Base Camp is approximately 81 kilometres. It is among the shortest and most budget-friendly treks in Nepal. For Nepalis, lodging costs around $5 to $10 per day. For foreigners, the overall cost of the trek ranges from $800 to $1500 on average per person. Annapurna Base Camp trek can be done at any time throughout the year as each season offers a different trekking experience. The ideal time for the trek depends on your weather preferences and what you expect from it. However, autumn (September to October) and spring (March to May) are considered the two best seasons for the trek, as the days at the time are warm and bright with clear skies.Bardiya National Park Bardiya National Park, located in the southern Tarai belt of Lumbini province, is home to one of the most elusive and majestic animals on earth—the Royal Bengal Tiger. The park, which covers an area of 968 square kilometres, is considered one of the most important protected areas in the country. It is a prime destination for those looking to catch a glimpse of a tiger. A bit of luck and patience will offer a good chance to see the Bengal Tiger. The jungle safari also offers one the opportunity to spot Asian elephants and the greater one-horned rhinoceros. The rare Gangetic river dolphins are occasionally spotted on rafting trips along the Geruwa River, the eastern channel of the Karnali river. Besides, visitors can enjoy the homestays and explore local Tharu culture. The right time to visit the park is from mid-September to mid-December and mid-February to May.Khaptad National Park Khaptad National Park in Sudurpaschim province is a protected area in the far western region. It stretches over four districts of Bajhang, Bajura, Achham and Doti and ranges in elevation from 1,400 to 3,300 metres. The park can be visited throughout the year. Trekkers are advised to bring their tents, food and other supplies. The Nepal Tourism Board says of late, social media has been increasingly influencing Nepali travellers to go to Khaptad. Since the far-flung Khaptad National Park is still offbeat for many travellers, the area remains pristine and fresh. The seasons of spring (March-May) and autumn (October-November) are the ideal times to visit the park. The temperature ranges from 10°c to 20°c offering pleasant trekking weather. The monsoon begins in June and lasts until September and during this time, roads often become muddy and slippery. From December to February, winter brings snow and chilling winds to the park.Limi Valley \nOnce again, my heart swelled with joy when my hometown came into view.Arriving at Lalikharka after the treacherous journey through Pauwa Bhanjyang and the bustling Kanchhi Dokan, Phidim, the headquarters of Panchthar district, revealed itself like a surprise gift. My home town, Phidim, is unique in the fact that it reveals to travellers approaching it from uphill. As the vehicle descends the mountain road, it slowly comes into view, its houses and buildings recognisable for the native son.This Dashain, I undertook the much-awaited trip to my hometown with my wife Kabita and daughter Aarohi. Little did I anticipate the transformation that awaited me.The moment I got out of the jeep, I noticed that Phidim, nestled in the lush hills, has undergone a remarkable transformation over the years. As I guided my family to my home, which had suffered damages in the 1989 quake that struck eastern Nepal, I found that old, mud and stone houses had been replaced by concrete buildings. The place was vastly different from the one I remembered.Arriving at my childhood home felt like reuniting with an old friend. Navigating its nooks and crannies with my daughter, we delved into the history of the house, a symbol of my cherished memories.My wife had visited Phidim years ago, spending a month with my parents. She, too, recalled beautiful moments she had had in the town. I asked the tenant about the neighbours and acquaintances. Some had died, while others had left for good.A call to local journalist Giriraj Banskota led me to the school grounds, where memories flooded back. This was where I spent my teenage years, playing ball, learning to kick, and watching major tournaments. Here, I even encountered a group of Western climbers headed to Kanchenjunga, the world’s third-highest mountain. I remember being awed by their shiny yellow tents, headlights and strange smell. I remember practising my tutephuteko Angrezi with the climbers. Birendra Shield, an annual sports tournament named after the late king, brought ace players from various schools in Panchthar district. The district also hosted Yuba Mela, an annual three-day fair to commemorate the birthday of the king, organising football tournaments in which teams from as far as Sunsari and Taplejung participated. I never excelled at dribbling balls. A boy growing up in a seven-member family, I soon found my interest in literature. In the late 1980s, Phidim hosted a major literary festival. In the run-up to the 1990 pro-democracy protest, walls were painted with anti-monarchy slogans, local politicians were arrested. I took my family to my school, Naya Namuna Secondary School. It was Saturday, so the school was closed. I peeked through the steel gate and wall, imagining myself labouring over classes. Memories are hazy, but what I remember most is going out of the school—to quiz contests with me leading the school team, to essay competitions at the District Education Office and to play carom board, a national pastime, in a nearby shopfront. Returning to the main street, the demolition of a landmark gate made me reflect on how cities transform, shedding old landmarks for new identities. Navigating narrow alleyways, I felt like a stranger in my own hometown. Multistory buildings have emerged and roads have been paved, reshaping the town. It’s the same place with a different face, leaving me nostalgic for the Phidim of my memories.We finally reached Shivalaya temple, which I told my wife and daughter was one of my cherished hangouts. A giant statue of Falgunanda (the Kirant leader’s birthday is celebrated on November 10) stood before the steps to the temple. Though my wife suspected I came here to smoke, in reality, I visited the temple in the evening to meet friends and talk about issues that mattered most to us at the time. It also offered a panoramic view of the town (I could not take my family to Gadhi Danda, a hillock across the Shivalaya).Towards the end of my journey, I felt sad about Phidim’s lack of prospects. To my dismay, I found that people have been leaving the town in droves. Despite blacktopped roads and multi-story buildings, Phidim faces a troubling reality. The lack of quality higher education and specialist healthcare has driven people away, echoing the circumstances that led me to Kathmandu years ago. Conversations with locals confirmed a mass exodus from the town, a trend that raises concerns about Phidim's future.My conversations with familiar strangers led me to conclude that Phidim has transformed into a transit town for pilgrims heading to Pathibhara Devi Temple, which is around 255 kilometres north in Taplejung district. I met dozens of people headed to the holy site. While pilgrims see it as a stopover, for me, it was a homecoming. The realisation dawned that Phidim is, perhaps, in a state of transition, trading its rustic charm for the hallmarks of urbanisation. While I left Phidim for higher education in Kathmandu, people from rural areas have flocked to the town in search of better opportunities, bringing life and energy to the once quiet community.As we bid adieu to my hometown, I couldn’t help but reflect on the inevitability of leaving a place, no matter how enamoured one is with it. Passing Kanchhi Dokan, I pointed out Kanchnajungha and Kumbhakarna to my daughter—symbols of my childhood. Phidim, now a blend of nostalgia and change, remains etched in my heart, a testament to the intricate dance between memory and evolution. \nUnilever Nepal, through its personal care brand Dove, officially sponsored Nepal’s National Women’s Football Team by presenting exclusive travel kits to 27 players and officials at the All Nepal Football Association (ANFA) office. This initiative highlighted Dove’s commitment to supporting the athletes on their journey to success, focusing on care, empowerment, and confidence.Dove aimed to strengthen its presence in football culture through a long-term, values-driven partnership, promoting women’s football and aligning with major tournaments such as the FIFA Women’s World Cup.Unilever Nepal hoped to foster positive societal change, creating emotional connections with audiences and building sustainable initiatives that extended beyond traditional sponsorships.As Nepali women continued to make strides in various sectors, Unilever Nepal recognised the potential of the national women's football team to inspire the future of women's athletics. \nLionel Messi scored his 10th international hat-trick and had a hand in two more goals as Argentina thrashed Bolivia 6-0 in South American qualifiers for the 2026 World Cup in front of an adoring home crowd at the Monumental stadium on Tuesday.Making only his second international appearance since recovering from an injury sustained at the Copa America in July, Messi capitalised on a mistake by defender Marcelo Suarez to open the scoring in the 19th minute.Bolivia goalkeeper Guillermo Viscarra made a couple of fine saves to prevent the hosts from extending their lead but he was beaten in the 43rd minute when Lautaro Martinez scored from Messi’s quick cross.Argentina made it 3-0 just before the break, with Messi setting up Julian Alvarez to score.Lionel Scaloni’s side controlled the second half and looked like they had extended their lead through Nicolas Otamendi, only to see the goal disallowed for offside.Substitute Thiago Almada did make it 4-0, however, scoring from Nahuel Molina’s pass in the 70th minute with the venue transformed into an Argentine party.Messi, 37, gave fans more reason to celebrate in the closing moments, beating two Bolivia defenders before unleashing a fierce shot past Viscarra to score his second.Messi needed only two more minutes to complete the hat-trick, joining Portugal’s Cristiano Ronaldo with the most in men’s internationals, the Argentine skipper scoring with a left-footed drive to take his tally to 112 goals for his country.“It’s really nice to come here, to feel the affection of the people, it moves me how they shout my name,” Messi said.“This drives me. Enjoying being happy where I am. Despite my age, when I’m here, I feel like a kid because I’m comfortable with this team. As long as I feel good and can keep performing the way I want, I’ll keep enjoying it.”Argentina are top of the standings with 22 points, having returned to winning ways after losing to Colombia last month and drawing with Venezuela last week.The 2026 World Cup will be hosted by the United States, Mexico and Canada. \nRaphinha converted a penalty in each half to guide an improved Brazil to a 4-0 home win over Peru in South American World Cup qualifiers on Tuesday.Building on last week’s 2-1 comeback win in Chile, Brazil looked livelier from the start and dominated possession, with late goals from Andreas Pereira and Luiz Henrique putting the gloss on an impressive performance.Brazil, who had lost four of five qualifiers before their win in Chile on Thursday, are fourth in the standings on 16 points after 10 games, trailing third-placed Uruguay on goal difference.“I think we needed this, it was really important winning both games to get back on track,” Raphinha told Brazilian television Globo.“They were two games that we managed to control. It’s a long way from perfect, but I believe we’re on the right track.”After hitting the crossbar in the 24th minute, Raphinha gave the home side the lead from the penalty spot in the 38th minute after Peru defender Carlos Zambrano was penalised for handball.The Barcelona forward extended Brazil’s lead from the spot in the 54th minute after Zambrano had fouled Savinho in the box.Substitute Pereira scored Brazil’s third with an acrobatic volley in the 72nd minute, brilliantly finishing a cross from Luiz Henrique, who wrapped up the win two minutes later with a low strike from the edge of the box.Argentina hammered Bolivia 6-0 and top the standings on 22 points, three points ahead of Colombia, who thrashed last-placed Chile 4-0.Davinson Sanchez opened the scoring for Colombia with a deflected header in the 34th minute and Luis Diaz doubled their lead early in the second half with an easy finish into an empty net after a bad mistake by the visiting side’s defence.Jhon Duran and Luis Sinisterra wrapped up the win as Chile suffered a fifth consecutive defeat in qualifying.Paraguay beat Venezuela 2-1 and are sixth on 13 points, level with fifth-placed Ecuador and one ahead of Bolivia in seventh. The top six sides are guaranteed a berth at the 2026 finals in North America. \nNepal's Head coach Rajendra Tamang announced the 23-member Nepal national women’s football team for the upcoming 2024 SAFF Women’s Championship on Monday, with Angila Tumbapo Subba named as the captain.

The team will face Bhutan in their opening match on Friday. \nChina will never commit to renouncing the use of force over Taiwan, the government in Beijing said on Wednesday after another bout of war games and a visit by Chinese President Xi Jinping to the scene of a famous defeat for Taiwanese forces.China, which views democratically governed Taiwan as its own territory, staged a day of large-scale drills around the island on Monday that it said were a warning to “separatist acts” following last week’s national day speech by Taiwan President Lai Ching-te.“We are willing to strive for the prospect of peaceful reunification with the utmost sincerity and endeavour,” Chen Binhua, spokesperson for China’s Taiwan Affairs Office, told a regular press briefing in Beijing.“But we will never commit ourselves to renouncing the use of force,” he said.That is, however, aimed at the interference of “external forces” and the very small number of Taiwan separatists, not the vast majority of Taiwan's people, Chen said. Taiwan has close though unofficial relations with the United States, a major arms supplier, and its allies.“No matter how many troops Taiwan has and how many weapons it acquires, and no matter whether external forces intervene or not, if it (Taiwan) dares to take risks, it will lead to its own destruction,” he added.“Our actions to defend national sovereignty and territorial integrity will not cease for a moment.”Chinese state media reported on Wednesday that President Xi had arrived the previous day on Dongshan island in China’s Fujian province, which faces Taiwan and where in 1953 China beat off an invasion attempt by Taiwan-based military.The world’s biggest luxury group has a growing problem with China.The defeated Republic of China government fled to Taiwan in 1949 after losing a civil war with Mao Zedong's communists. No armistice or peace treaty has ever been signed.Xi was on the island to learn about efforts to revitalise the countryside and the “passing on of red genes and strengthening the protection of cultural heritage”, the official People's Daily said, referring to the colour of the Communist Party.He urged officials from Fujian to promote cross-strait cultural exchanges, and “enhance the ethnic, cultural and national identity of Taiwan compatriots,” according to Xinhua news agency.'NEGATIVE EFFECT'Taiwan’s government rejects China’s sovereignty claims, saying only the island's people can decide their future.Speaking to reporters in Taipei earlier on Wednesday, Taiwan National Security Bureau Director-General Tsai Ming-yen said China's drills had backfired given the international condemnation they generated, especially from Washington.“The Chinese communists’ military exercise has created a negative effect in that it made the international community more supportive of Taiwan,” he said.Lai, in his Oct. 10 speech, said China has no right to represent Taiwan, but the island was willing to work with the government in Beijing to combat challenges like climate change, striking both a firm and a conciliatory tone which Taiwan officials said was a show of goodwill.Chen, the Chinese spokesperson, said Lai had stuck to his “stubborn separatist position”.“There was no goodwill to speak of,” Chen said.Lai has repeatedly offered talks with China but been rebuffed.China's military on Monday held open the possibility of more drills around Taiwan depending on the level of “provocation”.In a report to lawmakers, a copy of which was reviewed by Reuters, Taiwan’s defence ministry said China was trying to legitimise the use of force against Taiwan, to undermine military morale and to “deplete the military's combat power”.“In response to the severity of the enemy threat, the military continues to maintain a high degree of vigilance and make every effort to improve training and preparedness,” it said.China has over the past five years sent warships and warplanes in the waters and skies around Taiwan on an almost daily basis.On Wednesday morning, in its daily update of Chinese activities in the previous 24 hours, Taiwan's defence ministry said it had detected 22 Chinese military aircraft and five navy ships around Taiwan. \nChaaaiiittt…The spontaneous eruption of the sound of victory thundered through the neighbourhood of Nhyokha in the Kathmandu core. The line of a kite cut another. Looking out the window of her house, Sajani Shrestha saw children running full speed, shouting and fighting as they vied to catch the falling kite and thread. And craning her neck up to the sky, she could not count but only be mesmerised by the innumerable kites strewn across the skies of Nhyokha, Bangemudha, Indrachowk. “There would be so many kites that they entirely covered the blue of the sky, making beautiful patterns of different colours,” says the 51-year-old. “And you cannot imagine the number of times the call of chait rang in the air.”Clear blue sky and gentle westerlies, the season of kites has arrived in the Kathmandu Valley. While kites soared Kathmandu's sky mainly during Dashain, the kite season officially started in Nag Panchami (August) and ended on the Haribodhini Ekadashi (November). And from royalities to commoners, young and old all flew kites from rooftops and open grounds. Even those who did not, like Sajani, revelled in the live spectacle in the sky as kites soared and fought. With Bhimsen Thapa’s help, King Girvanyuddha flies kites The earliest written account of kite flying is believed to date to 200 BC in China. In Kathmandu, this tradition has religious and socio-cultural and environmental significance, says Tina Manandhar, lecturer of Nepalese History, Culture and Archaeology at Tribhuvan University. According to her, it is believed that kites in Kathmandu skies carry a message to the god of rain Indra that the valley's farmers have had enough rain for their crops. That is why Kathmandu farmers scolded anyone flying kites before plantation season.In an article ‘Changako Utpati Ra Bikas’ published in Gorkhapatra in 1995, historian Rajesh Gautam points to the lack of written documents indicating the exact time when kite culture was introduced in Nepal. Exploring different opinions on kite's introduction to Nepal, he writes that “some have opined the possibility that the skill and tradition of kite flying might have entered Nepal through India.” Yet some others, he writes, state that kites “came to Nepal from Japan during the time of [Rana PM] Dev Shumsher.”He concludes that most likely this tradition was introduced by Malla-era Newar traders: “But since Nepal’s relationship with Tibet and China is very old and direct, kites might have entered Nepal through the Newar traders who were engaged in the trade. One can estimate that the kite was introduced to Nepal during the (mediaeval) Malla regime.”In Social History of Nepal, TR Vaidya, Tri Ratna Manandhar and Shankar Lal Joshi write that there exists documented evidence of the kite flying from the early 19th century. The authors state that Sundarananda, a contemporary poet, has mentioned that the young king Girvanyuddha Bikram Shah (r.1799-1816), with the help of Prime Minister Bhimsen Thapa, flew kites from the towering temple of Taleju Bhawani, Hanumandhoka. And when the king's kite cut the kites of the youngsters, they were located and rewarded with money.In Tyas Bakhatko Nepal, Sardar Bhim Bahadur Pandey states that “During the month of Kartik [October-November] young and old all flew kites,” suggesting that kite culture was ubiquitous in Kathmandu by the early twentieth century.Anticipations and preparationsKite flying in Nepal requires a kite, a lattai (a wooden spool), thread and majha (homemade adhesive prepared by boiling snail slime, rice or sago, and powdered glass from burnt electric bulbs and coated on the line to sharpen it for kite fighting).77-year-old Nirmal Man Tuladhar, an avid kite flyer and retired professor of Linguistics at the Tribhuvan University, explains how Nepali tradition of kite flying was both expensive and needing advance preparation.“In our times, it wasn’t easy to fly kites,” he says. “We had to prepare majha …And as Nepali kites are fighter kites, we mainly fought with other kites [which meant we spent a lot of threads].”This preparation needed first and foremost of passing a hurdle: securing finances and materials to fly kites. While lattai was a one-time investment that could be saved for years, kites and threads had to be replenished every time a kite was cut.“Those were the times when parents wanted us to be more focused in our studies. They only gave money [to buy kites] after immense pestering,” says 80-year-old Dwarika Nath Dhungel, former Secretary of Nepal government, speaking of the 1950s and 1960s.Biodiversity specialist and botanist Tirtha Bahadur Shrestha, 86, was born in Mahabouddha and began flying kites from 1951-52. He saved what little money he got for afternoon snacks to buy Hattimar reel, a brand of line wound in a small lattai, which was strong and sharp and where majha stuck well.Raghuji Pant, a member of parliament, also recalls the difficulty in securing money to sustain his kite flying in and around Kathmandu core in the 1960s and early 1970s. “Four to five of my kites were cut in a day,” writes the 67-year-old in his 2019 article “Changa Jastai Udi Hidne Man” published in Himalkhabar. “[This caused] the line in the spool to shorten. From Bhadra [August-September] to one to one and a half months after Dashain I spent flying kites. So, it was difficult for me to have enough kites even after getting money from grandfather, grandmother, mother and everyone.”Kites and thread secured, now began the crucial work of preparing and applying majha whose strength determined how well it cut other kites. Govinda Tandon, 70, a historian and heritage expert, who grew up in Battisputali, was also an ardent kite flyer.“Materials for making majha were prepared right from the morning on a holiday,\" he writes in his article “Dashainko Butte Changa” published in Gorkhapatra. “Because this work couldn’t be accomplished without a collaboration of 3-4 friends, a holiday was set aside for this. Moreover, a sunny day was considered appropriate. If the majha didn’t dry, the thread could turn moist, and so if it felt like the day wouldn’t be sunny, the entire plan…was aborted.”Kite makers, kite sellers and variety of kites One of the oldest shops in Kathmandu's memory, Shree Chitrakar Kite Center in Tyauda, Asan is bustling with customers during Dashain. “When my grandmother got married and came to this house at age 12 [in early 1940s], this shop was already here,” says its fourth generation owner 47-year-old Dinoj Chitrakar. “So the shop must be around a hundred years old.”Another shop that stands out in Kathmandu's memory is Manandhar Kite Center in Kalimati, established in 1949, and currently run by brothers Mohan Man and Sundar Man Manandhar.In his book Antar Taranga, artist and writer Manuj Babu Mishra recalls “a kite shop near the old halwai shop of Chabahil” in the 1940s. Dhungel and his 1960 batchmates of Juddhodaya Public School recall the kite shops from the 1950s and 1960s – Bekhacha’s Shop at Netapacho, Bhaicha’s Shop at Nhyokha, Lata Manandhar’s Shop at Maru, Kanchha Buddha Bajracharya Shop at Tyauda.Besides the shops, there were makers and sellers of kites cloistered in different localities of Kathmandu Valley.In Kwalkhu, Patan was a Joshi who made Nepali paper kites.“One day I accompanied my uncle to buy kites,\" writes Dibya Giri, 69, in his 2023 article “Changa” in Sahitya Post. “I was amazed to see the huge stacks of kites there. We used to call it the house of the kite maker.”In Nhyokha, Purna Bahadur Shrestha began making kites as a teenager and started his own kite business in the 1950s, according to his daughter Sajani.These kites, made out of Nepali paper, often had different paintings. Mishra recalls painting kites for the kite shop in Chabahil.“I went to that kite shop and with the freely available colours and Nepali papers, I spent my day painting faces, birds, animals, masks, mountains, hills, whatever came to my mind,” he writes in the book. “Such kites apparently sold well!”Most septuagenarians and older generations like Tuladhar and Tirtha Bahadur recall flying kites made of Nepali paper when young. Tirtha Bahadur says that kites from Lucknow began coming to Kathmandu only after the late 1950s. But at least a section of Kathmandu was flying kites from Lucknow from the early twentieth century. Vaidya, Manandhar and Joshi write that the Ranas and Shahs imported kites from Lucknow and that from them, their favourite employees also got to fly some. These kites were large and, in Tyas Bakhatko Nepal, Pande writes that they were referred to as Lucknowia kites.Known for their characteristic hissing sound they made while flying, light body, swift movement and ability to take sharp turns, Lucknow kites were preferred by kite fighters.“Lucknow kites were lighter and could be manoeuvred well,” says Tuladhar. “Kites of Nepali paper were stable but difficult to manoeuvre. They were also expensive. So only some fighters flew Nepali paper kites.”The kites had different names depending upon their designs and colours – Ambe (a heart in the centre), Dibdibe (chequered), Pakhete (a different coloured paper on one edge), Sete (white-coloured), Nilchi (blue-coloured), Rate (red-coloured) and so on.The kite fighters preferred the strong and sharp Hattimar reel that came on a small lattai. The Belchamar reel was cheaper but weaker and prone to be cut by other threads. Kite fliers and kite watchers on rooftops and open groundsBibek Shrestha, 57, and his two brothers took stacks of kites and climbed their rooftops. The rooftops around theirs in the neighbourhood of Nhyokha – in fact in all core settlements of the Valley – were filled with kite fliers and spectators. Many risked precariously balancing on the sloped roofs.While Bibek and his brothers’ kites alighted to meet the sea of kites in the sky, their sister Sajani and other family members gathered around to revel in the live spectacle.Dhungel remembers the rooftops of Jhochhen and surroundings of the 1950s and 1960s swelled with kite fliers. Dhungel did try to fly kites. But he did not become a successful kite flyer. What he did become was, like Sajani and many Kathmandu residents, an admirer of kites soaring in the sky.“But more than engaging in my unsuccessful kite flying attempts, I enjoyed looking at the kites flying. There would be a big crowd of spectators. Females and other family members watched the kites fly as they ate meat and chiura. Some even drank and rejoiced as they flew kites.”When the age of cassette player and speakers dawned in the 1980s, songs blared from the speakers alongside kite flying. Chitrakar and Bibek invited their friends, put their favourite songs on speakers and spent entire afternoons flying kites, dancing, singing and eating.Away from the core cities, in the villages in the Valley, people flew kites in open fields. Like Dibya, who set his kite for flight from the banks of Godavari River in Tikathali. Chhauni was also a popular space for flying kites.Kathmandu’s joy in kite fightingBibek pulled his kite down and then manoeuvred it back up so his line touched his opponent's line from below and quickly reeled out his line. The resulting sharpness from the speed cut the opponent's line.Chaaaiiitttt………“The greatest fun comes from cutting another kite's string,” writes Tuladhar in his 1996 article “Cutting is the greatest fun” published in magazine Kite Lines. “With its coating of adhesive paste and ground glass, the string is as sharp and abrasive as sandpaper on your opponent's line.”Nepali kite, Tuladhar says, is made to fight other kites, and describes how a kite line cuts the other.“The technique is to touch your rival's string and immediately reel out line at high speed,” he writes. “The Nepalese style of kite flying is aggressive, and though the kites look simple, they are strategically designed for bringing down other kites.”At any given time, like Bibek’s kite above Nhyokha sky, skies above the Valley were filled with raging kites, swinging, coming down and going up as the fighters reeled in and out their lattais in ferocious attempts to bring down other kites.Meanwhile spectators cheered. “Even passersby stopped to look at the kites,” recalls Tina.The moment of a kite cutting was accompanied by the sound of chait, and children ran in the direction of the falling kite to grab it and the thread in what was termed as, Dibya says, changa lutne/dhago lutne.Dhungel always joined in to shout the chait resounding through the locality of Jhochhen and almost automatically his feet sped towards the severed kites' direction.“‘Oii leave that thread,’ the kite owner would scold me. ‘Why do you pull my thread, leave it right now.’ But I’d continue pulling the threads as the owner continued shouting. Other times I caught the kites that had failed to fly and dropped on the ground.”The fallen kites got stuck in the buildings, trees or poles, or glided down in the open grounds or paddy fields. Falling kites from the Kathmandu core settled down in Tundikhel covering it. Oftentimes kites fell on the fields to rest upon the lush paddy nearing its harvest.“Children ran straight into the fields to catch the kite,” says Dibya. \"They destroyed the crops by stepping on them. Some farmers chased them, scolding along as they did so and if they caught anyone, they slapped them.”Love and restrictions on kiteAmidst the raging kite fights high up in the sky, there were apparently also some quieter kites lingering much lower among the buildings or tree lines, for their goals lay in not ruthlessly cutting the threads of other kites but piercing softly through the hearts of their owners' love interests. During the Rana regime, there were designated public spaces to fly kites, writes Gautam in his article. Referring to oral accounts, he writes that the Ranas were particularly careful to avoid kite flyers around their durbars. This is because love-stricken men tied letters to kites and flew them into the durbars to their love interests among the nanis.He writes that the kites could be flown mainly on the grounds of Chhauni. Anyone flying kites in any other place and around Rana durbars were arrested.Pant also recalls love-stricken boys from his time. “Just as kites came in different colours and patterns, so did kite flyers,” he writes in the article. “Some wrote love letters using a few words in “symbolic language” on a plain kite and attempted to land it on the rooftop of the girl they liked. Some simply landed their kites on any rooftop if a girl appeared there and waited for reaction.”King Tribhuvan among kite fliersPande writes in his book: “Once or twice during kite season every year, King Tribhuvan went to Chhauni to fly kites. Legend has it that if the line of the king’s kite was cut, it flew to Lhasa. But since anyone who caught that kite received five rupees, everyone attempted to catch that kite.”In 2021 news report ‘Bhawanle Chhekidiyo Changa Udaune Aakash’ by Shivahari Ghimire published in Nayapatrika, cultural expert the late Satyamohan Joshi also recounts that “During Dashain, Tribhuvan came to the ground below Swayambhu to fly kites. […] He did not use the same thread to fly kites twice.”In the same article, Joshi says that the King also went to Budhanilakantha to fly kites and participate in kite flying competitions.End of season, end of cultureMohan Krishna Shrestha, 86, was born in Budhanilakantha. Every year, on the day of Haribodhini Ekadashi, he saw the annual fair at the Budhanilakantha Temple. He also witnessed kite fliers gathered in the open fields around the Temple.“Oh, it’d be a lot of people,” says Shrestha. “They came from all around Bhaktapur, Kathmandu and Lalitpur.”They flew kites on Ekadashi, Dwadashi and some even until Purnima.“They took all the remaining threads and kites that had survived Dashain and flew the last kites of the season,” says Tuladhar. “I remember my uncles, relatives and neighbours going to Budhanilakantha with their kites.”Joshi recalls in the 2021 article that King Tribhuvan also went to Budhanilakantha with his sons Mahendra, Himalaya and Basundhara. He greatly supported and also participated in the competitions there organised by the commoners. If he liked he gave prize money to the winners.This annual event lost its glory days after the decline in the open fields as buildings began to rise with the establishment of Budhanilkantha School in 1972, Mohan says.“The event survived in some form until the 1990s,” he says.But what happened after that?The end-of-the-season event in the 1990s was also an indication of the end of the age-old kite tradition.“If I go to my ancestral place in Asan to fly kites, it’s not possible for me to do that today because there are buildings everywhere,” says Tuladhar. “Cityscapes and urbanisation have created the obstacle for flying kites.”Dibya does feel like flying kites sometimes.“No space to fly kites today,” he says. “In the old times, there were river banks and open fields. Even if you fly kites, it gets stuck in somebody's rooftop or water tank or somewhere.”Yesteryear’s kite enthusiasts believe that increasing means of entertainment was another reason for the decline of kite culture.“When television came, kite flying started to slowly decrease,” says Bibek. “And then mobile phones robbed kite flying even more.”And so, when his sister Sajani cranes her neck up in the sky today, she rarely sees a kite.“Those days we heard one chait after another,” she says. “These days you won’t hear a single chait.” \nIn 2008 Matina Shakya was only three years old when she was appointed as the Kumari of Kathmandu. She was succeeded by Trishna Shakya as the new Kumari in 2017.Kumaris are revered as goddesses of beauty and strength in certain Hindu and Buddhist traditions. Worshipping young girls as Kumaris is a 2,000-year-old practice in Nepal. Since the 13th century, when the Malla kings ruled, the Newars of the Kathmandu Valley have been worshipping Kumari, a girl from the Shakya/Bajracharya community chosen to embody the divine energy of goddess Taleju Bhawani. The reign of a Kumari ends when she starts menstruating. So long as she is serving as the Kumari, she is believed to be the nation’s divine protector, safeguarding it from evil. Matina, 18, is now in her first year of college, studying for a bachelor’s degree in management. Her father, Pratapman Shakya, when asked about having a daughter who is the only living the goddess in the world said, “Not having your own daughter live in the same house as you seemed a little unfair, but we feel very proud to call ourselves the parents of the royal Kumari who is revered by people all over the world.”On March 9, 2023, he, along with Matina, were getting ready for a special function held to honour all former Kumaris from across Nepal. “There are often events to honour Matina as she was the royal Kumari, but this one was dedicated to all former Kumaris from different areas. There are 129 living Kumaris in all,” he added. Besides Kathmandu, Kumari tradition is followed in Bhaktapur, Lalitpur, and Kirtipur, among other cities.According to him, this was the first time an event like this was organised and the Deputy Mayor of Kathmandu, Sunita Dangol, was also in attendance.Throughout the year, many people line up outside the ‘Kumari Ghar’ to get a chance to visit the Kumari and get her blessings. Many foreigners stand out in the yard to catch a glimpse of her. Nepali people believe that if a Kumari smiles at you, it is a bad omen.Everyday, a tutor visits the Kumari to help her continue with her education as she is not allowed to step outside the Kumari Ghar. She takes her exams and does her homework from the Kumari Ghar itself. She also has the freedom to play inside the Kumari Ghar. Many former kumaris have pursued careers in their fields of interest or studied after their term ends, and they continue to be treated with the same respect. The tradition of Kumari has evolved over time. In the past Kumaris did not enjoy these freedoms.Because of various superstitious beliefs, Kumaris were not fully educated and were forbidden from getting married because of the belief that the groom would die soon if he married an ex-Kumari. They led secluded lives, were restricted from participating in normal childhood activities, and focused solely on their religious duties.However, now, these myths have been dispelled. Modern understanding has shifted to recognise that Kumaris, after stepping down from their divine role, have the freedom to marry and lead a normal life. The perception of Kumaris as isolated figures has evolved, with a focus on providing them with a more balanced upbringing. There have been initiatives to integrate Kumaris into regular social and educational settings, allowing them to have a more holistic and fulfilling childhood experience. “Matina was already familiar with the students from the school that she attended after her term as Kumari ended,” said Shakya. “The kids visited the Kumari Ghar frequently so that she could have a smooth transition,” he added. According to Gautam Prasad Shakya, who has been living as a caretaker in the Kumari Ghar, the changes made to the tradition are minor. “The traditions of Kumari have mostly stayed the same. All the rituals are still practised like in the old days,” he said.On 6 May 2005, Pun Devi Maharjan, a lawyer, filed a case in the Supreme Court claiming that the traditional practice of electing young girls as Kumaris, or “goddesses’, who are expected to follow certain social restrictions and appear at religious festivals, violated the rights of the child. Quoting Maharjan’s complaint, Puskar Mathema writes in Yuwamanch Monthly of October 2007, “If Kumari tradition is continued, it will undermine the fundamental rights as well the freedoms of children guaranteed by the constitution and child rights treaties. Apart from this, it will have a negative impact on their physical and mental development.”The case continued while Nepal overthrew the monarchy and declared itself a secular state in 2007. When the judgement was pronounced in 2008, the goddess was still in her role, now giving blessings to the country’s President. The court ordered that the Kumaris and ex-Kumaris receive better benefits and arrangements and ordered the government to improve their support and allowances.In April 2006, Prof Chunda Bajracharya filed a petition at the Supreme Court against Maharjan’s petition, who had argued against the Kumari tradition. Bajracharya contended that the tradition should be preserved as heritage due to its over 100 years of history.“People who don’t understand the culture shouldn’t comment on it,” she stated. Bajracharya also criticised the human right activists who contended that Kumaris were only allowed to wear the colour red. “People who say Kumaris are forced to wear red clothing all the time, are the same people who send their kids to schools in uniform,” she said.“After the 2008 court verdict, there have been a lot of improvements. Now, a teacher visits the Kumari Ghar daily to tutor the Kumari, who is expected to complete school assignments and sit periodic exams. All the former Kumaris now get benefits like scholarships and special pensions,” she added.Bajracharya is currently a professor of literature at the Tribhuvan University in Kathmandu.“The only significant change that the court verdict brought to the tradition was in terms of her education,” said Gautam Prasad Shakya, the caretaker. “Kumaris were tutored long before the case, but the case helped formalise this arrangement. After the court verdict, the time between 12 pm and 4 pm was designated as the Kumari’s tuition time,” he added.After the verdict, there was a concerted effort to provide Kumaris with access to quality education, enabling them to develop the skills and knowledge needed to lead fulfilling lives beyond their divine roles. There was also a shift towards ensuring that the Kumari's living quarters are comfortable, safe, and conducive to her overall well-being.Moreover, the selection process for the Kumari underwent reforms in the aftermath of the Pun Devi Maharjan case. There was a push for greater transparency, accountability, and inclusivity in the selection of the Kumari, with an emphasis on ensuring that the process was fair, respectful, and free from undue influence.Efforts were made to support their transition into adulthood, including providing them with comprehensive resources for education, vocation, and social integration. This shift aimed to address the challenges faced by former Kumaris and empower them to lead independent and fulfilling lives after their divine service.“The Kumari tradition has evolved over time. During the tenure of my daughter, we saw a lot of improvements. Even after her time as Kumari, Matina continued to get a lot of government support,” said Shakya, former Kumari Matina’s father.“Some people argue that child rights are being violated, but all of her rights are being upheld inside the Kumari Ghar. This is a unique and respected aspect of Nepali culture, and I don’t believe it violates any of my child’s rights.”While the Kumari tradition continues, its practices have evolved. “She enjoys this normal life and it didn’t take her long to adjust as well,” says Matina’s father, on her transition from the revered Kumari to the ordinary Matina. \nWhat animals did Juddha Shumsher have in his zoo?“We only have records of animals from the mid-1960s,” says Ganesh Koirala, who has been employed at the Central Zoo for the past 36 years and currently serves as its information officer and programme officer. “That too I hand-copied from an old torn-down file that I came across.”Today, the Central Zoo, which sprawls across six hectares in Jawalakhel, Lalitpur, houses as many as 1,298 wild animals of different species of mammals, reptiles, fishes and birds from Nepal and around the world—from tiger, rhinoceros, hippopotamus and red panda to its recent attraction: a pair of chimpanzees.After enduring decades of neglect under various government bodies, with its animals and infrastructure scraping along in a deplorable state, the zoo received a new lease of life with improved infrastructure and animal care in 1995, when it came under the management of the King Mahendra Trust for Nature Conservation (KMTNC), now known as the National Trust for Nature Conservation, in 1995.Today, the Central Zoo is an entertainment venue, one of the most happening places in the Kathmandu valley. Flocked by thousands of daily visitors, the zoo now also hosts rescued animals and those in need of rehabilitation. It is also a site for conservation education.But when Juddha Shumsher Rana (prime minister from 1932–1945) built the Jawalakhel Zoological Garden on the premises of his Jawalakhel Durbar (where Nepal Administrative Staff College stands today) in 1932, he did so purely for private interests—as a space of entertainment and amusement for him and his family.Built in the semi-wilderness of Jawalakhel around a historical pond dating to the 17th century during the reign of King Siddhi Narsingh Malla, the zoo also became the space he could use to show his respect for two women he revered, his mother and sister-in-law, and indulge in one of his favourite pastimes—gambling.Today, the Central Zoo, nestled in the heart of Jawalakhel's sprawling crowd, does not go unnoticed, and its story is well told. But what passions drove Juddha to build the zoo? What was its original layout? What animals did it have in the beginning? And how did Juddha spend time there?“I remember once seeing a small board that read ‘Jawalakhel Zoological Garden’,” Koirala says. “I don’t know whether it was from Juddha’s time or was made in the later years. It must surely be that Juddha built the zoo out of influence from the British given how this term was used by them.”Koirala adds, “There is a former employee, now an elderly gentleman who worked in the zoo in the 1960s. He surely has some stories from Juddha’s time.”Birds, beasts and palacesTo trace the birth of Jawalakhel Zoological Garden, one has to look at the history of Nepal’s rulers owning birds and animals.Like rulers around the world, Nepal’s royalty kept wild and exotic birds and animals in captivity as a source of pleasure and mark of wealth and power. The book ‘Social History of Nepal’ by historians TR Vaidya, Tri Ratna Manandhar and Shankar Lal Joshi details how Mallas during the mediaeval Kathmandu Valley to Ranas and Shahs in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries owned rare, exotic creatures. In 1708, a rhinoceros in Kathmandu Valley broke the iron chain in which it was bound and killed its tamer. In 1714, Bhaktapur’s King Bhupatindra Malla gifted a camel and an elephant to Kantipur’s King Bhaskar Malla to build peace.Among Shahs, King Rana Bahadur Shah in particular was reputed for his collection of birds and animals. He also owned a zoo outside his palace in Basantapur Durbar Square, where the Nepal Bank Limited stands in New Road today. The zoo contained “tiger, bear, monkey, elephant, horse, deer… heron, peacock… pigeon, wild dogs, rabbits, rats, mongoose.”Jung Bahadur Rana’s zoo on the premises of his Thapathali Durbar hosted a variety of birds and animals collected during his hunting expeditions as well as those brought from abroad. Jung Bahadur himself used to “supervise and inspect it”. Juddha Shumsher likewise had his own collection of creatures which steadily expanded into a zoological garden. Seeking wilderness in his Jawalakhel DurbarJuddha’s biographer Ishwari Prasad writes in ‘The Life and Times of Maharaja Juddha Shumsher Jung Bahadur Rana’ that between 1933 and 1940, Juddha shot 433 tigers, 33 rhinoceros and 93 leopards. An insatiable big-game hunter, Juddha had a deep fondness for being in the wild and among wild animals, and from this came, according to oral history prevalent among members of Kathmandu’s Rana community including Juddha’s descendants, the desire to own a zoo.Built in 1752, Schönbrunn Zoo in Vienna, the world’s first modern zoo, was already over 100 years old when Juddha was born in 1875. London Zoo opened in 1828 and Alipore Zoological Garden (Kolkata Zoo) in 1875. Nawab Wajid Ali Shah Zoological Garden (Lucknow Zoo) was established in 1921. Juddha’s inspiration, his descendants say, was most likely reinforced by his tours to zoological gardens during his visits to England in 1908 and to different Indian cities.An article titled ‘Central zoo in state of neglect’ published in The Kathmandu Post in 1996 says that Juddha one day “received a pair of leopards as a gift”, cementing his desire to own a zoo. A report ‘Central Zoo Master Plan’ prepared by the KMTNC in 1996 says that Juddha decided to build a zoo in an epiphany when he saw that some animals “including deer, a few rhinos, and some tigers had been collected from the Tarai and kept in Kathmandu” could be put into one compound in the “lonely piece of land with a large 16th [sic] century Malla period Pokhari”.The pond lay still and serene surrounded by green wilderness ever since Patan’s King Siddhi Narsingh Malla built it in the 1600s. On the grounds surrounding this pond, the Newars from Na:Tole, Pulchowk and surroundings had their devisthans where, for centuries, they gathered to perform their religious ceremonies during Basanta Panchami and Bhoto Jatra even after this area fell within the Jawalakhel Durbar.For the palace, the ground served as its extended garden along with a horse and elephant stable. Subodh Rana, 69, grandson of Juddha Shumsher, recalled his father Kiran Shumsher telling him that Juddha and his family sometimes also used the scenic grounds for picnics. If there was any spot where Juddha wanted to build a menagerie, it would be around this Pokhari (pond). One day, he called his grandson General Maheshwar Shumsher Rana and deputed him to the task of doing just this.The zoo’s layout—except for the small plots of lands acquired later—that was in place when it came under KMTNC's management was, the present and retired zoo officials believe, mostly the same as it was built by Maheshwar and so offers a peek into how Juddha’s zoo must have been like. Pond in the middle of the ground surrounded by enclosures—the southern bank housing mainly larger animals, and cages for birds positioned on the northern banks.From pigeons to the king of the jungleWhat animals and birds did the enclosures at Juddha’s zoo house?“We cannot tell for sure,” Koirala says.Once it came under government ownership, the zoo was tossed from one institution to the other for lack of interest and knowledge on the right institution to manage it. Amid all this chaos, documents were possibly lost and the zoo has no concrete record about the animals that Juddha must have once taken amusement at, said Koirala.Mukti Narayan Shrestha, 82, a retired secretary of the Nepal government, joined the Central Zoo in 1970 as a veterinarian when many original structures of the zoo were still intact. Shrestha also worked with an elderly khardar who, he says, was employed in the zoo since the time of Juddha and was about to retire when he joined.“In those days where the purpose of menageries was exclusively for exhibition and pleasure with no regard for the welfare and recreation of animals and birds, the cages were tiny and iron-barred,” Shrestha says.Elephant, horses, deer, monkeys, tiger, rhinoceros, clouded leopard, red panda, bear, palm civet (nir biralo), four-horned antelope, Himalayan goral, pheasants, Himalayan monal—from the mythical and the majestic, the gentle and friendly to the fiery and ferocious, Juddha’s zoo boasted them all, Shrestha says.Shrestha’s account is not different from the anecdotes passed down to other retired and present zoo officials and the members of the Rana community, who also detail the rare and the exotic fauna, like the gharial crocodile and porcupine, even the jungle’s king—creatures, they say, that Juddha must have received from foreigners as gifts—appearing alongside domestic birds like pigeons.Tidbits of published information also confirm that the zoo had a good collection of exotic birds and animals from Nepal and abroad. One such suggestion comes from Kalyan Shumsher’s ‘Shree Teen Juddha Mahima’ published during Juddha’s reign in 1943.“One need not travel abroad to see the incredible birds and animals found in foreign countries,” he writes. “It will suffice to see [those creatures] right here in the zoo opened by His Holiness Shree 3 [Juddha] in Jawalakhel.”Among these incredible creatures, one reigned supreme—lion, the king of the jungle.For one, it would not have satiated Juddha to build a zoo and not have the jungle’s king exhibited in it. Juddha hence must have done everything possible to ensure one for the zoo. Infrastructure at the zoo suggests that the lion indeed lived at Juddha’s zoo or, in the least, during the Rana regime.“Where bear habitat lies today, there were two dome-shaped attached enclosures with a holding room, constructed in the classic architecture that many enclosures in the British zoos had in the past. They had brick walls and lime plaster,” Koirala says. “These were built to house a lion in one cage and a tiger in the other.”Near these enclosures stood another cage that remains intact today, with the head of a roaring lion carved out of the wall on the top of its iron bars. Zoo officials as well as members of the Rana community believe that Juddha had this exhibit built to specifically house a lion.Remarkably, these Juddha-era infrastructural spaces are corroborated by a rare piece of photographic evidence. A 1946 photo of the zoo shows a lion while a Kathmandu mother and her sons stand in front of its cage.Juddha’s place of piety and playThe zoo was not merely a space that Juddha sought out for amusement and retreat in the outpost of his palace; he also used this place to express his deepest affection.This affection spills right at the zoo’s entrance, in the form of the life-size statue of Karma Kumari Devi, wife of Juddha’s elder brother and Rana Prime Minister Dev Shumsher. Karma Kumari stands tall in her regal costume shaded by a wide canopy. Juddha revered Karma Kumari because it was she who raised him and looked after his mother Juhar Kumari Devi after the death of his father Dhir Shumsher. On another prominent part of the zoo on the south-east, Juhar Kumari’s enthroned statue overlooks the pond. Juddha had commissioned the London-based sculptor Domenico Antonio Tonelli to cast these statues.When Karma Kumari’s statue was unveiled is not clear, but Juhar Kumari’s statue was unveiled by Juddha amid a grand function in 1935 on Jawalakhel’s most auspicious day, Bhoto Jatra. It was attended by the British Resident Frederick Bailey.“On June 28, 1935, at Jawalakhel Durbar… the pond nearby looked very scenic,” says a Gorkhapatra news report titled ‘Statue installation’ dated July 5, 1935. “Because it was the day of Bhoto Jatra of Machhindranath… and moreover since an ideal woman’s statue was being unveiled, there was a crowd of lakhs of people.”Less than fifty metres from Karma Kumari’s statue stands a one-story building with a pagoda roof that today serves as the zoo’s meeting hall. Juddha, an avid gambler, found the scenic semi-wilderness covered in trees and filled with the sounds of wildlife to be a perfect place to relish the game. So he built a building with twelve doors on its four sides allowing him and his fellow gambling compatriots the freedom to enter through a particular door that they thought would bring luck. He called it his Juwa Ghar, the gambling house, and built it with the sole purpose of indulging in the game he loved. Roar of lion reverberates in KathmanduThe sounds of the animals and birds in the zoo rose up in the Jawalakhel sky. Every day, until much later in the 1970s, roar of the zoo’s lion (there were later other lions) diffused to far corners of the Valley, merging the zoo with the spirit of Kathmandu and informing the city folks of its presence.But was the zoo open to the public as well?“I think once it was built, the zoo was open for the public,” Subodh Rana said. “It is unlikely that Juddha Shumsher built such a large zoo and kept it only for his family.”For one, Kalyan Shumsher mentioning that one “need not travel abroad to see the incredible birds and animals found in foreign countries” suggests that the public had at least some access to the zoo. Of course, the Newar community from Na:Tole, Pulchowk and surrounding areas were permitted inside the zoo on the days of their guthi functions on Basanta Panchami and Bhoto Jatra.As the zoo was established at the back of the ground where Bhoto Jatra celebrations happen, it naturally filled with revellers on this day in addition to the guthi ritual observers as testified by the Gorkhapatra report. The photo of the mother and her sons also bear testimony that the zoo was not entirely closed to the public.What is widely believed, though, is that the zoo officially came under government ownership after Nepal became a democracy in 1951. And it would still be a few more years before it was open to the public in 1956.In 1945, Juddha gave up his power and eventually retired in Dehradun, India, where he died in 1952. With time, Jawalakhel Zoological Garden became the Central Zoo. It would take many avatars—a neglected site of crammed, unmaintained cages with sad eyes of emaciated creatures staring from behind the bars, a focal point of animal diplomacy, particularly during the period of monarchy, to, in its recent decades, a space of conservation and education.When all this was happening, the city sprawled around Jawalakhel, subduing the lion’s roar with its noise. More wildlife from around the country and the world came—creatures captured from the wild, those sold by circuses, those rescued from traffickers. Fate would bring these creatures to the care of generations of Kathmandu folks, intertwining each other’s joys and sorrows. After the tale of Juddha’s Jawalakhel Zoological Garden, there would be these stories to tell. Sitting around a table inside Juddha’s Juwa Ghar, Koirala and other zoo officials begin unfolding these stories before me. \nNepal’s book market is no stranger to the popular Bangladeshi-Swedish writer Taslima Nasrin. Almost all of her books have been translated into Nepali, but Nasrin herself says that they are all unauthorised translations. “All books [Nepali translations] are pirated versions,” Nasrin told the Post in a Whatsapp conversation. Nasrin, who is currently in exile in India after facing death threats in Bangladesh following the publication of her novel Lajja (Shame), said that she or her publishers have never allowed anyone the right to translate her books into Nepali. “I don’t know of any such Nepali publishers. No one asked for permission and no one has paid [me] royalty.”Translating and publishing books without permission from authors or publishers is a punishable crime. But Nepal’s book market is full of such unauthorised translations and prints of books written by the who’s who of the world literature. Such endeavours haven’t just hurt the authors but also the readers, says Ajit Baral, publisher of the Kathmandu-based Fineprint publication. “These translations are poor,” Baral says. “Tomes with 1200–1300 pages have been trimmed to 200–300 pages. An example is the biography of Bill Clinton.”Another popular book that has seen unauthorised Nepali translation is the biography of Steve Jobs by Walter Isaacson.“We have no official deal in place for a [Nepali] translation of Steve Jobs,” Peppa Mignone, associate agent of the CAA, the translation authority of the biography, said in an email interview with the Post.The book’s Nepali translation is published by Panchpokhari Publication House. The translated book identifies the translator thus: “Achyut Koirala, who has a master’s in English literature, is primarily a journalist. He is currently affiliated with Nagarik daily. He keeps a close tab on international history, politics and culture and has written scripts and dialogues for half a dozen Nepali films. He has published over a dozen non-fiction books.”Koirala, who admits to the unauthorised translation, claims that he hasn’t just translated the book but has also done ‘creative writing’ with it.‘Rich Dad Poor Dad’, written by Robert Kiyosaki and Sharon Lechter, is among the books that’s perennially on the bestseller list across the world. Upon investigation, the Post found three Nepali translations of the book—all unauthorised. One of them is translated by Dilip Kumar Shrestha and published by the same firm, the Panchpokhari Publication House. Another Nepali iteration of the book is published by Book For All publication and translated by Kopila MD. Yet another Nepali version is translated by one Sudheer Dixit and published by Plata Publication, Kathmandu.In an email conversation with the Post, Ronson Taylor, who oversees the international rights at The Rich Dad Company, said, “At this point in time, we do not have a relationship with an established publisher in the [Nepali] language market. If there are any Rich Dad Poor Dad books currently for sale in the Nepali market, they are pirated.”Basanta Thapa, a writer and translator, says that many books are being translated of late to make easy money. “But how would the quality of these unauthorised translations be!” Thapa wonders. “Readers who haven’t read the original wouldn’t know the faults in the translated versions.” Thapa says that any translator worth his salt aims to ‘recreate’ a book and it takes much work to do that.Taslima’s books are the major victimsTaslima’s memoir Uttal Hawa has been translated into Nepali as ‘Sangharsha’, literally Struggle, and is published by Khoji Publication House. Even though the book in its cover claims that it is an authorised translation from the English version Wild Wind, it is a pirated one. The book is translated by Bikash Basnet and edited by Bhogiraj Chamling. A revised version of the book is edited by Sangeet Srota (Yam Bahadur Chhetri).The same publication house has also published the Nepali translation of the book’s sequel as ‘Prem ra Jeevan’. Publisher Sushil Chalise says that while he is aware that one needs to receive permission from the author or the publisher to translate a book, his efforts to contact Taslima were unsuccessful. Therefore, he had published the version the translator made available to him. Translator Basnet, too, admits he translated the book without Taslima’s permission. “About a decade back, we didn’t know how to ask for permission,” he said.Nepal has the Copyright Act (2002) in place. Before it, there was the The Patent, Design and Trade Mark Act, 2022 (1965) that included intellectual property in its 2006 revision. Even the Muluki Ain (Civil Code) of 1910 BS had a provision about copyright. Moreover, it goes without saying that translating somebody else’s work without permission is immoral.Likewise, Indigo Ink Pvt Ltd has published a Nepali translation of Taslima’s anthology of essays No Country for Women as ‘Aaimai ko Kunai Desh Chhaina’. The book is translated by Krishna Giri and edited by Pramod Pradhan. “I have no idea about the agreement between the publisher and translator,” Pradhan, who is also a children’s book writer, says. “I just copy-edited it upon request.”Bishnukumar Poudel, publisher of Indigo Ink, however, claims that he is still trying to take translation rights for the book. “We translated the book long ago,” he says. “We are still trying to get translation rights.”Indigo is also publishing unauthorised translations under its imprints All Book Store Pvt Ltd, Book for All and Plata Publication. It has published two versions of Rich Dad Poor Dad under those shadow imprints. But Plata Publication is not registered in the Company Registrar’s Office.Pradhan says that many foreign books have had unauthorised translations in Nepali and their quality is poor. Those books are translated not from the original language but from a second or third language, so these translations are bound to have problems, he says. “After I learned that those were unauthorised translations, I have stopped editing them,” Pradhan said.Indian author Shiv Khera’s You Can Win has been translated into Nepali by Bloomsbury India and has granted the distribution rights to Ekta Books. But the book’s unauthorised translations are also found in the market and they don’t even mention the name of the publisher and translator. What is interesting is they mention that it’d be illegal to republish the book, or an excerpt of it, without the author’s permission.The Nepali translation of the book, which was poorly written and rife with inaccuracies, had landed the publisher at court. After a complaint was filed at the District Court Kathmandu in 2066BS on the charge that the publisher violated the copyrights and economic rights, the court had issued a verdict on Mangsir 11 that year, charging a fine of Rs10,000, Rs20,000 and Rs30,000 to the defendants Netra Prasad Pokharel, Narayan Prasad Bhusal, and Bhagwati Risal and Bishnu Silwal, respectively.Baral, the Fineprint publisher, says that international publishers wouldn’t demand much for translation rights given Nepal’s small market, but Nepali publishers do not bother to reach out to them. “Publishers who put out unauthorised translations and sell them at 50 percent discount have troubled publishers like us,” he said.Fineprint has published authorised translated versions of books such as Leaving Microsoft to Change the World by John Wood, Healed by Manisha Koirala, and Hippie by Paulo Coelho. The publication house is also set to release the Nepali translation of Israeli historian Yuval Noah Harari’s bestseller Sapiens. Translated into Nepali by Dinesh Kafle, the book’s translation right was acquired at the cost of USD1300, Baral said. Likewise, the publication acquired the translation rights of Sadhguru’s Inner Engineering at IRS93,000, he added.Baral says that publication of unauthorised translations is an immoral and illegal work. “This phenomenon not just hampers Nepal’s fledgling book publishing industry but also tarnishes the country’s reputation in the global market,” Baral said.Thapa, the writer and translator, points out the lack of regulatory mechanisms in the country. “We don’t have an agency that regulates the quality of translations being done,” he says. “Nobody compares the translation with the original. We need a dedicated authority to enhance the quality of translation.” Universities, Nepal Academy and other stakeholders can play a role to uplift the translation sector, he adds.One’s pain, another’s pleasureWhen the author Suketu Mehta was travelling through Mumbai, a young man approached him with a handful of books while his vehicle was stuck in traffic. Brandishing Maximum City, written by none other than Mehta himself, the young man requested the author to buy a copy. Suketu leafed through the book and said, “This is a pirated copy and I’m the author of this book.” The youth wasn’t bothered and replied, “Okay, you can buy it at a discount.”This anecdote was shared to the Post by Mehta’s friend, the author and professor Amitava Kumar, in an email exchange.Most of these pirated books are imported into Nepal from India while the retailers of original books are finding themselves increasingly in trouble. “We sell original copies but many readers doubt us as well, given the ubiquity of pirated versions,” says Anjan Shrestha, operator of Education Book House, Jamal.Ramchandra Timothy, chair of Thapathali-based Ekta Books Pvt Ltd, said that the phenomenon of piracy has tarnished Nepal’s image internationally. “There was a time when Bangladesh would be known as ‘piracy king’,” he said. “Now there's a risk Nepal would take the crown.”As tax increases, so does piracyThe government decision to impose a 10 percent tax on book imports in fiscal year 2019-20 led to a proliferation of pirated book markets, booksellers say. After the decision, booksellers started to cut back on imports and that led to the entry of a new crop of pirated booksellers, a trader in Kathmandu says. But following widespread backlash, then finance minister Bishnu Paudel struck down the policy.“After the government’s decision, we stopped importing books for a while,” says Shrestha of Education Books. “The import of books went down for about two years. Then the pirates stepped in to fill the gap. It was about that time that pirated copies of biographies and memoirs of Obamas and Jai Shettys became omnipresent in the market.”Pirated copies of classics by Roald Dahl and JK Rowling also made an entry in the Nepali market. Then the phenomenon only saw a rise.Since the customs department does not levy duty on foreign books and also does not care to differentiate between the pirated and original copies, unauthorised books have found a safe haven in Nepali market.The government doesn’t levy any customs duty on books and newspapers published by foreign publishers abroad. The importers should only pay Rs565 at the customs points. But Nepali publishers have to pay 10 percent tax to import books printed in India.James Taylor, director of Communications and Freedom to Publish of the International Publishers Association, says that the government, publishers, writers and readers should join hands to control widespread piracy. “The government should realise that book publishing and reading culture contribute to the country’s economy as well,” he said, adding that the government should seize pirated books and close websites that sell pirated ebooks.Nandan Jha, executive vice chair of Penguin Random House India’s sales, production and business department, says that piracy has emerged as a big challenge for publishers of late and has harmed the authors, publishers, distributors, printers, readers and other stakeholders. “To confront piracy, all the stakeholders should launch a special joint effort,” Jha told the Post in an email exchange.Piracy has proliferated in the Nepali market to such an extent that the publishers of such books and unauthorised translations keep whatever ISBN numbers they like, often conflicting with other books, and still get off scot free. If scanned or searched on the internet, the ISBN number gives details on the author of the book, what the book is about, and its price, among others.Bijay Sharma, information officer at TU Library, says, “Keeping ISBN number at one’s will is illegal. If anyone files a complaint, we can punish them.”By the lawThe Muluki Ain-1910 BS had mandated that a publisher take permission of Gorkha Bhasa Prakashini Samiti before publishing any material. The Copyrights Act came into effect in 2022 BS and was amended in 2054 BS. In 2059 BS, a new Act was promulgated and it is still effective now. Authorities are currently working to amend the Act to give the registrar’s office more autonomy regarding copyright.According to the 2059 BS Act, copyright violations are considered government cases. In such cases, plaintiffs should file a complaint with the police. The Act’s clause 25 has various conditions that amount to violation of copyright. The Act’s subclause A says that if a publisher produces or copies material in writing or sound and sells or distributes it, it amounts to violation of copyright.Likewise, the Act’s clause 26 prevents selling of unauthorised material. The clause restricts the ‘importation of copies of work or sound recording, either made in a foreign country or sourced otherwise, into Nepal for business purpose shall not be permitted if preparation of such copies would be considered illegal if they were prepared in Nepal.’If anyone infringes upon protected rights, they are liable to punishment but the provision’s implementation remains lax.The law gives the authority to district court to take legal action against copyright violators.Advocate Parshuram Koirala says that if the government becomes more proactive, it can punish violators on the basis of the 2059 BS Act and thereby control the phenomenon of intellectual theft and copyright violations. “Creation is a crucial part of humanity’s benefit,” he says. “If intellectual property is not protected effectively, then there’d be no inspiration to create something.”Bal Bahadur Mukhiya, a professor at Nepal Law Campus, suggests the inclusion of rules about digital piracy in law, and also the clauses of various related international treaties and agreements that Nepal is part of.“In the US, a teacher or professor should pay a certain revenue even to photocopy a chapter of some text for teaching purposes,” Mukhiya says. “But in Nepal, those who photocopy an entire book and sell it go scot free.”(This report is prepared in collaboration with the Centre for Investigative Journalism, Nepal.) \nThe academic community in Nepal has been buzzing with discussions about research and publishing for quite some time now. This trend is noticeable, especially with the rise of academic institutions—business schools in particular—that have established research centres to support both faculty and students. Many of these institutions highlight their research endeavours on their websites. Furthermore, independent research and consulting organisations that claim to undertake high-quality research have proliferated in the country. Upon reviewing their reports, it becomes apparent that many are simply collections of facts, lacking in-depth analysis and scientific rigour. These documents appear more like consulting assignments aimed at meeting client demands quickly rather than fostering genuine knowledge creation. Although they may superficially resemble research, they do not possess the rigorous standards characterising true scientific inquiry.Disconnect between academia and industryAs a coordinator of the academia-industry interface at a business school, I frequently interact with clients who approach us with research requests. Many of these domestic and international clients demonstrate a surprising lack of understanding of the research process. For example, I once had a conversation with a representative from an international organisation who wanted us to conduct a national-level study involving a mixed-method research design—within two or three months. This unrealistic expectation reflects a broader misconception among many clients that research is quick and inexpensive work when it is a complex, time-consuming process that requires significant resources.The misunderstanding extends to domestic clients as well. Often, they request research work at the last minute, either because they have leftover funds to spend or because they need documentation for their ongoing projects. These clients fail to realise that research is about \"searching again\"—a meticulous process of exploration and discovery aimed at generating new knowledge or enhancing existing theories. It cannot be rushed. Professionals often view research as gathering information without appreciating the systematic methods and discipline necessary for conducting scientific investigations.State of scientific research The government's investment in research is alarmingly low. Nepal spends approximately 0.03 percent of its GDP on research and development, with only 0.011 percent of the education sector's budget allocated to innovation. This figure is minuscule compared to what is required to foster a vibrant research culture. In the most recent budget, Rs197.29 billion was allocated to the Ministry of Education, Science, and Technology (MoEST), which included a plan to establish a fund dedicated to research and innovation of Rs1 billion. Considering Rs1 billion, it effectively comes to 0.01 percent of GDP for research alone. The government also aimed to promote research and capacity development in institutions affiliated with Tribhuvan University, such as Centre for Economic Development and Administration (CEDA), Research Centre for Educational Innovation and Development (CERID), and Centre for Nepal and Asian Studies (CNAS). However, despite these announcements, only a few initiatives have come to fruition.There are many reasons for the lack of research output. First, for many academics, research is simply a requirement for promotion. Faculty members are often burdened with administrative responsibilities, leaving little time for meaningful research. This issue is not unique to Nepal but is a global challenge. Second, findings from research are primarily shared with a select group of subscribers or funding bodies, limiting their impact and visibility. There is a growing need for research to be more widely disseminated and reach the broader public.Third, there is a lack of support for researchers. PhD aspirants in Nepal face additional financial barriers. Unlike in many other countries, where PhD students receive full funding, students in Nepal often have to pay tuition fees, discouraging many from pursuing advanced research. The government and universities must provide better financial support for PhD students to ensure that talented researchers do not leave the country searching for better opportunities abroad.Barriers faced by academiciansMany Nepali universities do not prioritise quality publications. Sadly, these are not considered a criterion for promotions. Additionally, academic leaders lack awareness of ranked journals and quality parameters and indexes. My conversations with colleagues at various higher education institutions (HEIs) reveal another significant barrier to research productivity: Promotion to administrative roles. Several dedicated researchers find that once they are promoted to dean or associate dean positions, they no longer have the time to conduct research. This problem is compounded by the fact that most HEIs do not allow faculty members the flexibility to focus exclusively on research, forcing them to juggle administrative duties alongside their academic work. Nepali academicians also face significant challenges in accessing up-to-date software for data analysis and quality journals, as most universities in the country do not subscribe to the high-quality academic resources available at many international institutions. This lack of access restricts their ability to publish in reputable outlets. Furthermore, even if a researcher manages to get published in a prestigious journal, universities in Nepal are often unable to cover the article processing charges (APCs), which many institutions abroad pay for. Additionally, unlike reputed Indian HEIs, where faculty are incentivised to produce high-quality research articles and case studies, such a system does not exist in Nepal. As a result, faculty members have little motivation to prioritise research, leading them to focus predominantly on teaching responsibilities. The University Grants Commission (UGC), established under the University Grants Commission Act of 1993, allocates a large portion of its budget—about 50.4 percent—to Tribhuvan University, leaving little for other institutions. The UGC's Research Development and Innovation Programs Implementation Guidelines (2019) aim to support junior faculty members and PhD students, but the process is often challenging. My experience with the UGC when applying for a PhD scholarship was frustrating. Despite meeting the eligibility criteria, my application was rejected without clear reasoning, leaving me disillusioned.Cultivating a research cultureUniversities in Nepal should serve as knowledge centres that actively produce new knowledge. Academicians must seek research funding from domestic and international sources at both the individual and institutional levels. The UGC should develop mechanisms to allocate research funds based on the quality of research output, with clear indicators such as publication in reputable journals and citation counts. Those who contribute significantly to high-quality research should be incentivised, ensuring their work gains recognition within Nepal and the global academic community. Without such incentives, research in Nepal will remain underappreciated and disconnected from the broader international research landscape. In conclusion, cultivating a genuine research culture in Nepal requires concerted efforts from all stakeholders. Leaders in academia, governments and businesses must all recognise the importance of research for scholarly and broader national growth. With sufficient financing, institutional support and dedication to scientific rigour, Nepal can foster an atmosphere where research flourishes and advances knowledge worldwide. \nGig economy is expanding rapidly worldwide, and Nepal is no exception. According to a 2015 RAND American Life Panel survey, alternative work arrangements in the United States increased from 10.7 percent in 2005 to 15.8 percent by late 2015. Today, the US gig economy is valued at about $1 trillion and is projected to grow at an annual rate of 16 percent. By 2027, it is expected to offer nearly 100 million gig jobs—far exceeding Nepal's yearly GDP. In South Asia, the economy is booming, with India leading the way. The number of gig workers in India rose from 6.8 million in 2020 to 7.7 million in 2021, and projections suggest it could reach 23.5 million by 2029. Bangladesh follows closely, with approximately 6.5 million gig workers.The gig economy consists of flexible, short-term jobs often facilitated online. These range from ride-sharing and food delivery to freelance work and e-commerce. Popular global platforms for ride-sharing include Uber, Lyft, Ola and Grab, as well as freelancing sites like Upwork and Fiverr. A software engineer in Kathmandu can work on projects for a tech company in the US or offer online training programmes nationwide.Gig economy in NepalIn Nepal, the gig economy is gaining momentum due to urbanisation, technological advancements and increased access to digital services. Platforms like Pathao, Tootle and Foodmandu are becoming commonplace, allowing workers to set their own schedules. However, as it is still developing, reliable data on its size and impact are severely lacking. Many individuals are unaware of how gig platforms function, including their advantages, risks and legalities.Flexibility is a significant attraction for gig workers, enabling them to choose when and how much they work. Yet, this type of employment also comes with challenges such as job insecurity, unpredictable incomes and a lack of traditional benefits like health insurance and retirement plans. Despite these obstacles, the gig economy has the potential to help alleviate unemployment and poverty by offering short-term income opportunities. It offers various job opportunities for people with varying skill levels, from highly skilled positions like software engineers and programmers to semi-skilled and unskilled roles such as delivery drivers and ride-share operators. Additionally, it has been especially beneficial for women, allowing them to work flexibly, earn an income and overcome traditional work barriers.A recent study by a team of graduate students at Tribhuvan University highlights Nepal’s gig economy structure. The researchers surveyed 385 gig workers in the Kathmandu Valley, focusing on sectors like ride-sharing, online tutoring, e-commerce delivery, food delivery and freelancing. Notably, older individuals are more likely to engage in gig work compared to younger ones. High unemployment rates may compel older workers to continue their roles, while younger people often prioritise stable, traditional jobs, missing out on potential gig benefits. The study also found that individuals already employed are more likely to pursue gig work for extra income. Financial incentives play a crucial role; higher earnings from gig work encourage participation, indicating that families with lower incomes often rely more on these opportunities. Job satisfaction is also important for retention, with many gig workers continuing in their roles due to a sense of fulfilment.Ride-hailing services are a major component of Nepal's gig economy, but they come with significant challenges. The study indicates that ride-hailing workers face legal and regulatory uncertainties. Despite being legally recognised in 2019, gaps in the regulatory framework still pose problems. Additionally, social security and health care issues affect many ride-hailing workers, while others struggle with low pay and finding enough customers.This research is among the first to offer an empirical analysis of the gig economy in Nepal, providing insights into the gig workforce. Key benefits identified by respondents include earning potential, cited by 48.19 percent, and schedule flexibility, noted by 18.39 percent. However, legal and regulatory uncertainty was reported as a significant challenge by 37.56 percent of participants, while social security and health issues affected 32.64 percent. The survey also revealed that gig workers see a strong need for improved financial and saving options, with 34.72 percent highlighting this as crucial. Other essential support measures included tax benefits, performance-based bonuses, and calls for legal protections and better working conditions.Estimating the exact size of Nepal's gig market is complicated by a lack of legal frameworks and regulatory oversight. In developing economies like Nepal, where most financial transactions occur through informal channels, the growth of the gig economy creates an additional challenge for the government in regulating these financial activities and integrating them into legal systems. Additionally, the informal nature of the gig economy complicates tax regulations. Similarly, there is a noticeable gender gap in the gig labour market, especially in ride-sharing and delivery services, where women are largely missing, raising concerns about women's exclusion from these emerging job opportunities.Necessary interventionsPolicymakers have an opportunity to implement targeted interventions aimed at enhancing the inclusivity and sustainability of Nepal's gig economy. This could include financial incentives for workers transitioning between jobs, income support programmes, initiatives to improve job satisfaction and health and skill development training tailored to the needs of the gig market. Such measures would benefit gig workers and contribute to a more equitable and robust labour welfare in Nepal. As the gig economy continues to grow, addressing its challenges and utilising its potential will be crucial for creating a sustainable future for workers in Nepal. With the right policies and support, this evolving labour market could provide significant opportunities for many, helping to drive economic growth and improve living standards across the country. \nFor the past few weeks, Pakistan has been embroiled in intense negotiation and political bargaining to pass a constitutional package bill in the Parliament. The ruling Pakistan Muslim League-Noon (PML-N) does not have the numbers to muster the support in the Parliament. This amendment is politically significant for the PML-N. On the other hand, Fazlur Rahman of the Jamait-ul-Ulema Islam-Fazl (JUI-F), with eight seats in Parliament, is in for hard bargaining. It has insisted on arriving at a political consensus and has requested the government to delay the bill. The government appears to be in a hurry to pass the package as it will increase the tenure of the Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP), Qazi Faez Isa, who is perceived to be close to the ruling coalition. What added to the speculation is that on October 2, the Pakistan Supreme Court struck down its 2022 verdict, barring the legislators from voting against the party line, which would de-seat the legislator and force him/her to seek re-election while interpreting Article 63-A of the Constitution. Through an ordinance last month, the government already gave the CJP the power to reconstitute the Practice and Procedures Committee. The Special Bench constituted to hear the constitutional petition to review the verdict was not attended by Munib Akhtar, who protested and reclused himself from the Bench and Justice Mansoor Ali Shah, who was critical of the ordinance.This ordinance is perceived to help CJP Isa constitute a favourable bench so that the PML-N government can pass the constitutional package that has already been delayed due to a lack of 224 seats (two-thirds majority) in the Parliament, even though the government attributed the delay to ‘strategic reasons’. It is still working to reach a consensus but, at the same time, trying to encourage legislators from other political parties to defy their party instructions and vote in favour of this constitutional package. The PML-N has 75 directly elected seats, along with its coalition partners, the Pakistan People’s Party (PPP), which has 54 seats, and the Muttahida Qaumi Movement (MQM), which has 17 seats in the 266 directly elected seats in the National Assembly.Power configurationIt is a known fact that the Army has a stake in Pakistani politics, and many think that it played a role in putting together the present coalition to politically marginalise Imran Khan’s Pakistan Tehreek Insaf (PTI) that, despite all hurdles, performed spectacularly in the February election. Six months after this general election, the 70 reserved seats for women and minorities have not been distributed to the political parties based on proportional votes. The Supreme Court of Pakistan gave a verdict on July 12, saying that those PTI members who won the election as independents can claim the reserved seats as PTI seats. They do not need to join the Sunni Ittehad Council (SIC)—a party that could not even get one seat in the last election—to claim reserved seats. The Election Commission is yet to allot seats to the PTI despite the court’s threat of a contempt trial against it. After the reserved seats are allotted, the new seat arithmetic will not change the power configuration but bolster the PTI’s political presence.Interestingly, the government's proposed constitutional package was shrouded in secrecy, giving rise to speculation about its intent and urgency. The government defended its stance, saying the amendment has already been discussed in the Parliamentary Committee. It only relented when the JUI-F insisted on it in return for its support on September 14. According to media reports, some of the contents include establishing a constitutional court to unburden the Supreme Court, which devotes much of its time to deciding constitutional issues. According to the government, 60,000 cases are pending before the Supreme Court, of which 25 percent are constitutional petitions. For nearly a decade, Pakistan’s judiciary, including the Supreme Court, has emerged as a political battlefield for the political parties, the Army and the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI). The Supreme Court has also been divided over the constitutional propriety of essentially what are political issues. Unsurprisingly, there is a strong perception that the government wants to extend the tenure of Chief Justice Faez Isa, who is retiring on October 25. Justice Mansoor Ali Shah is going to be the next CJP.Issue of reserved seatOn July 12, the Supreme Court of Pakistan directed the Election Commission to distribute the reserved seats to the Pakistan Tehreek Insaf legislators who contested as independents. The court asked the party to submit the list of candidates for the reserved seats and also asked the PTI-linked independents to submit affidavits stating their allegiance to the party. In the intra-party elections case of January 13, 2024, the Supreme Court gave a verdict that the PTI cannot retain its election symbol as it failed to hold an intra-party election, forcing its candidates to contest the election as independents. While a decision was made earlier that the PTI independents would join the SIC to claim these seats, after the Supreme Court’s decision, the party applied for the allocation of reserved seats. The Election Commission of Pakistan said it would implement the SC’s order, but it held several meetings and could not arrive at a decision, further delaying the allotment. In July, it notified only 39 candidates from other political parties but not from the PTI. It said it does not have a valid organisational structure and does not know whom to approach to verify the PTI's nominated candidates for the reserved seats. After the intra-party election verdict, the ECP did not recognise the structure of the PTI. To nullify the SC verdict on the allocation of reserved seats, the Parliament passed The Election (2nd Amendment) Bill 2024, seeking amendments to sections 66 and 104. This means if the candidate has not affirmed his affiliation to the political party with the returning officer at the time of being granted an election symbol, it cannot have a claim to reserved seats based on proportional representation. After the amendment, it again sought the SC’s clarification on September 25. The Supreme Court passed strictures on the EC, saying the ECP’s action “significantly infringe upon the rights of the electorate and corrode their own institutional legitimacy.” While the reserved seat allocation remains unsettled for political reasons, the future of constitutional reform packages remains lingering. The JUI-F and PTI have announced that they will thrash out a draft constitutional package on their own. Meanwhile, CJP’s Isa has announced that he is not interested in extending his tenure and will retire on the due date. Yet, in Pakistan’s evolving politics, where the military continues to play a dominant role, the final curtain on the package is yet to be drawn. \nNepalis with disabilities face the daily ordeal of navigating cities that are not built for them. Whenever roads and sidewalks are built or expanded, the disabled community harbours hope of easier mobility. However, the authorities either overlook the accessibility for such people or carelessly build structures that are supposed to assist them. This renders people not only disabled by their conditions but also by infrastructural shortcomings. According to the National Census 2021, 2.2 percent of Nepal’s population has some form of disability; 2.5 percent of males and 2 percent of females have a disability. The country ratified the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities in December 2009. Moreover, the provisions in the Disability Rights Act ensure accessibility to physical infrastructure. Although Nepal has a progressive policy on the rights of people with disabilities, the implementation part has been lagging. An audit published by the National Federation of the Disabled-Nepal on 150 public infrastructure sites in Kathmandu showed that no samples were completely accessible: 132 samples were found “not accessible”, while the rest were “partially accessible”. In 2021, the Department of Roads allocated Rs 50 million for disabled-friendly pavements and even completed the first phase, a 1.5km stretch from Putalisadak to Thapathali. Although this is commendable, these supposedly disabled-friendly pavements need routine monitoring, as most of the tactile pavings built earlier ended abruptly or led to electricity poles, trees, walls or drains. Generalising disabilities and offering solutions that only cater to a specific group is also problematic. Most of the time, the authorities build tactile paving and label the area disability-friendly. However, problems of people with other forms of physical and intellectual disability—such as lack of tactile or audio indicators at zebra crossings, narrow sidewalks and absence of ramps—remain unaddressed.Although road accidents occasionally make headlines, accidents involving people with disabilities rarely get noticed. Many unreported cases involve people with disabilities falling into rivers or drains, collisions with poles or trees due to ineffective tactile blocks, and hit-and-run cases while crossing roads. These accidents can be avoided if basic assistance like railings, ramps, audio and tactile indicators, etc are ensured. In many instances, these problems arise not from the lack of disability-friendly infrastructures but from the general mismanagement and poor condition of public infrastructures. Potholes are a common sight on older roads and even some newer ones in Kathmandu. With the city’s rapid urbanisation, construction is happening every few metres. Building materials are often placed on sidewalks that are already narrow, leaving pedestrians with no choice but to walk on the roads. This poses a risk for everyone and could be perilous for people with disabilities. Moreover, the roads that seem perfectly fine the previous day are under maintenance the next day. The authorities do not consider providing an alternative disability-friendly route. Even the signs that inform of the situation of the roads ahead are ineffective. Doing the bare minimum to check the inclusivity list is not an option. Many government office buildings in Nepal are not disability-friendly, and the same applies to institutions like schools and universities. This is also due to the lack of proper budget, as disabled-friendly infrastructures are often not prioritised, depriving a significant and capable portion of the population of their fundamental rights. The government must ensure that people with disabilities have the rights that are promised in the constitution. As for our part as citizens, we must abandon our primitive mindset and be more inclusive of people with disabilities in our thoughts and actions. It’s time we realise that an inclusive nation leaves no one behind as it progresses.  \nFollowing two weeks of rain-induced disasters, disaster-hit communities still await rescue and relief, prompting the government to declare disaster crisis zones in affected areas, but concerns remain due to past failures and current challenges like isolation, inaccessibility, and ineffective government response and coordination.\nDecades-old landlessness persists in Nepal, disproportionately affecting women, Dalits, and ethnic groups, despite recent government efforts to resolve it.\nDevastating floods and landslides in Nepal caused 244 deaths, highlighting the need for enhanced disaster preparedness, risk assessment, and responsive land use planning in the face of extreme weather events influenced by climate change.\nDespite IMF and ADB projections of economic improvement, Nepal's economy faces challenges due to slow growth, declining capital formation, policy hurdles, and vulnerability to external factors such as remittance, tourism, and energy exports.\nParliamentary committee investigating cooperative scam finds Rabi Lamichhane and associates responsible for misusing funds, with the government implementing the report despite ongoing debate over Lamichhane's involvement.\nNepal debates amending its Constitution, with experts emphasizing the need for a broad consensus, expert review, and a focus on addressing the effectiveness of the three-tier federal system, executive head elections, and the division of powers between local, provincial, and federal governments.\nThe weather on Wednesday is forecast to be partly to generally cloudy in the hilly areas, while the rest of the country will remain mostly fair.

Though still a developing nation, Nepal was a land of profound beauty and deep-rooted cultural heritage. The residents of Nepal faced many challenges, but beneath these hardships lay a resilient spirit and an unyielding hope for the future.\n\nThis enchanting land, where Mount Everest reaches towards the skies and the air carries a mix of incense and cool mountain breezes, was more than a geographical marvel. It was a mosaic of cultures, languages, and traditions, a testament to human endeavor against all odds. Nepal's history, from the unification under King Prithvi Narayan Shah to its transformation into a federal democratic republic, told a story of aspiration and endurance.\n\nIn recent years, the people of Nepal, with their indomitable will, had taken strides towards rebuilding and reimagining their country. They turned their struggles into stepping stones, each challenge a chapter in their ongoing saga. The shift from a monarchy to a republic had not only changed governance but had woven a new tapestry of democratic values and collective decision-making.\n\nEconomically, while agriculture continued to sustain a large part of its population, Nepal had begun to harness the potential of its picturesque landscapes, developing sustainable tourism that promised to preserve their natural heritage while boosting local economies. Communities living in the shadows of the Himalayas had become stewards of the earth, protecting the biodiversity that made their country unique.\n\nEach day brought new stories. Whether it was a festival in Kathmandu, a technological advance in Pokhara, or a conservation effort in Chitwan, these events were threads in the vibrant quilt of Nepali life. These stories, updated daily, reflected the pulse of progress and the spirit of hope that characterized this resilient nation.\n\nAnd so, as Nepal moved forward, each moment was not just a passage of time but a promise of potential, a narrative of a nation perennially climbing towards tomorrow, guided by the legacy of its past and the dreams of its future.\n\nNews events:\nNearly two weeks after the declaration of several districts and local units ‘disaster crisis zones’, the disaster victims still await the help promised by the federal government. Floods and landslides triggered by incessant rains on September 27 and 28 caused widespread devastation in multiple districts. A few days later, the Cabinet meeting on October 4 decided to declare 41 local units of 12 districts ‘disaster crisis zones.’ However, people in the worst-hit areas are yet to get support from the federal government. Dinesh Lama, the chairperson of Roshi Rural Municipality in Kavrepalanchok, says many local units are still waiting for help. The government was supposed to deposit Rs10 million in local units’ disaster management funds, but the amount is yet to come, according to Lama.“We were told that our rural municipality was on the list of disaster crisis zones, but we have yet to get help from Singha Durbar [the seat of the federal government],” Lama told the Post. “Except for the helicopter assistance to distribute relief materials in the upper parts of the municipality, we haven’t received the help we should have as a disaster crisis zone.” Lama also claimed to have completed the rescue operation, and they are now focused on relief distribution and repairing damaged roads in the municipality. Like Dinesh Lama of Roshi Rural Municipality, Deepa Bohara, chairperson of Sunkoshi Rural Municipality in neighbouring Sindhuli district, said their local units have also not received any help from the federal government. “Our municipality suffered more infrastructure damage than human loss, but we are yet to get the Rs200,000 compensation announced by the government for the families of the deceased,” Bohara told the Post. “We were supposed to receive it through the District Administration Office, but we are still waiting.”At least three people lost their lives in the floods and landslides in her municipality, Bohara said.Deputy chair Rajan Prasad Ghimire of Konjyosom Rural Municipality in Lalitpur said the local units within the Kathmandu Valley have also not received adequate assistance from the federal government. Our local municipality has received Rs200,000 for each bereaved family and an additional Rs15,000 for those whose houses were damaged by the rain. Beyond this, we have not received any help from the federal government.“The federal government should have shifted those who have been rendered homeless due to the continuous rain to a safer place,” Ghimire told the Post. “The budgets of the local units in disaster crisis zones should have been increased, but the government has not taken necessary steps.”But Dil Kumar Tamang, information officer for the Ministry of Home Affairs, denies the claims made by local unit representatives. Tamang said the government has been distributing relief through the district disaster management units.“The monetary assistance the local units are receiving was sent by the federal government,” Tamang told the Post. “But there are still a few places where relief materials have yet to reach.”Tamang said that the government would soon resettle the displaced people.Meanwhile, Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli on Wednesday said that the government would expedite reconstruction and resettlement in areas affected by floods and landslides, with plans to develop safe and integrated settlements.Oli said that decisions on preliminary relief and temporary housing and bridge construction would be taken at the meeting of the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council, and a subsequent Cabinet meeting on Thursday. He said this while receiving a memorandum from a delegation from Khotang district at the Prime Minister’s Residence in Baluwatar on Wednesday. The memorandum concerned the damages from rain-induced disasters.The government had declared dozens of local units in districts hardest hit by the incessant rains as ‘disaster crisis zones’ to expedite rehabilitation, recovery, and reconstruction efforts. The October 4 Cabinet meeting named the most affected local units based on the recommendations from the Ministry of Home Affairs’ National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Authority (NDRRMA). According to the Home Ministry, at least 26 districts were badly affected by the incessant rain, and 12 of them were the hardest hit. Several local units from Panchthar, Okhaldhunga, Udayapur, Dhading, Dolakha, Ramechhap, Sindhupalchok, Lalitpur, Kavre, Sindhuli, Makawanpur, and Chitwan districts are on the list of disaster crisis zones. Under the Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Act 2017, the government can announce a disaster-crisis area to respond to a calamity by specifying its boundaries and a time limit.In crisis-designated areas, the government can make decisions such as prohibiting any operation that may adversely affect rescue work, employing government or non-governmental employees, and using government, non-government, or private movable and immovable property as needed for disaster rescue work, as per the Act.The Act says that if necessary, the government can seize vehicles from any agency or person in the designated areas and use them for relief and rescue operations. It can also fast-track procurement procedures to expedite reconstruction and rehabilitation efforts in the crisis-hit areas. \nIn July 2024, the sudden death of Anna Sebastian Perayil, a 26-year-old chartered accountant with an Indian affiliate of British accounting firm Ernst & Young (EY), sent shockwaves through social media and corporate corridors alike. Her family claimed that extreme work pressure pushed her to exhaustion, leading to her demise. Perayil’s death has now started a broader conversation about hustle culture, its glorification, and its impact on mental and physical health—questions that ripple beyond Indian corporate spaces to touch on workplaces and educational institutions worldwide, including in Nepal.While hustle culture is often associated with startup scenes or Silicon Valley tech giants, its grip extends beyond the corporate world into educational systems, especially in South Asia, where the lines between ambition and overwork often blur.Hustle culture is no longer limited to workplaces; it is creeping into colleges, where the pressure to excel and multitask is mounting. Shukraraj (whom the Post is identifying by only his first name), is a 22-year-old student at one of Kathmandu’s top colleges, who once dreamed of being a part of the prestigious institution. But three years into his degree, the reality has set in. “Many people dream of getting into this college… that’s how its reputation is. But internally, the pressure, rigidness, and push that this college puts on students in the name of ‘holistic growth’ is insane,” Shukraraj said.Shukraraj’s experience mirrors that of many students who, apart from their academic workload, are also expected to juggle extracurricular activities, internships, and never-ending assignments. “We have to be at the college’s beck and call. There’s so much to do, and if we fall sick and happen to be absent, they even give detention as a punishment for being absent—for being ‘sick,’” he says. His friend, who injured her leg during a Chhath celebration last year and missed a few classes, was given four days of detention and extra assignments. “They don’t see students as humans, just robots who should always excel.”Sukraraj’s words carry particular weight, especially when viewed in the context of Perayil’s death.Although one incident occurred in the corporate world and the other in an academic setting, the underlying problem remains the same: hustle culture’s dehumanising effect, where individuals are treated as mere cogs in a productivity machine.A study conducted on 6,972 workers in China found that unreasonable and long working hours negatively affected self-rated health (how individuals perceive their own health), leading to chronic fatigue and even death. Similarly, a large cross-sectional study published in Oxford Academic, of 24,685 employees in Japan revealed that overtime work indirectly increased stress levels through factors like mental workload, self-assessed amount of work, and reduced sleep, ultimately lowering organisational profitability.The findings of these studies align with the case of Suman Shah. The 32-year-old marketing executive from Sunsari spent six years climbing up the corporate ladder, only to realise that hustle culture had consumed him from the inside out. His typical workday began at 5 am and extended late into the night. “The culture in my advertising agency celebrated those who could outwork everyone, and I took that to heart,” he said. But the physical toll became unbearable—headaches, high blood pressure, digestive issues, and, eventually, a thyroid condition. Shah, like Perayil, realised too late that the pursuit of productivity was affecting his well-being. “In a country like Nepal, where job security is precious, I thought hustle was my only way forward—but it cost me my health.”Shah eventually left the job in 2024, moving to a smaller marketing firm in Ilam, where the work culture is friendlier.However, his story reflects a growing trend of employees burning out and leaving their jobs due to excessive stress.In fact, a study by the UK-based financial consulting firm Deloitte revealed that 77 percent of workers have experienced burnout, and 42 percent left their jobs because of it. “Hustle culture, with its glorification of constant work and productivity, takes a heavy toll on students and workers alike, affecting them on mental, emotional, and physical levels,” says Pratiksha Rajopadhyaya, a Kathmandu-based psychologist. According to Rajopadhyaya, the pressure to be continuously productive leads to chronic stress, burnout, and even conditions like anxiety and depression. “Mentally, the never-ending push to perform can cause sleep disorders, constant fatigue, and emotional exhaustion.”For many students and employees alike, the drive to succeed breeds feelings of inadequacy as they struggle to meet the often unrealistic expectations set for them. The emotional toll is huge, manifesting in what Rajopadhyaya describes as “imposter syndrome,” where individuals feel they are never good enough, no matter how much they achieve.Over time, this chronic stress erodes both personal satisfaction and professional productivity, a paradox in a culture that equates workaholism with success.“Nowadays, social media platforms like Instagram and TikTok are filled with influencers glorifying late-night work sessions, promoting the belief that personal worth is tied to productivity,” says Shukraraj.“At my college, it’s the same—most students are constantly exhausted due to the institution’s emphasis on the ‘rise-and-grind’ mentality, where meeting deadlines and fulfilling responsibilities overshadow rest and social life,” he adds.The question now arises: how can institutions—both academic and corporate—address the negative effects of hustle culture? According to Rajopadhyaya, for universities, the answer lies not only in monitoring students’ academic performance but also in caring for their emotional well-being. Schools and colleges must build environments that encourage learning without the constant pressure to excel in every domain.“Meanwhile, corporate environments must reevaluate their definitions of success and productivity. As research has shown, quality work comes from satisfied, well-rested employees, not those teetering on the edge of burnout,” she adds.As the discussion sparked by Perayil’s death continues, it serves as a timely reminder that the hustle culture’s promise of success often comes at too high a price.  \nRoad networks have now connected the far-flung Karnali region, providing hope to people, mostly apple farmers, who can now send their produce to the markets and get reasonable prices.However, the poorly-constructed road networks have become a bane for the villagers. Whenever the crops become market-ready, disaster strikes. Rural roads are often a lifeline for these communities, but they remain closed most of the time due to an increase in disasters, which experts attribute to climate change.Now, some apple growers are discussing whether their harvests could be sent to bordering Tibetan cities, as roads are frequently damaged during the monsoon season at peak harvest time, halting supplies to the Nepali market. “It would be a great relief for apple growers in Humla if they could export apples to the Chinese cities,” said Namgyal Tamang, former president of Humla Chambers of Commerce and Industry.The apple farm in Dolpa covers 412 hectares. However, the district faces difficulties in sending the fruit to the market. Farmers complain that their apples often go to waste. Last year, Dolpa produced 3,696 tonnes of apples, but only 50 tonnes made it to the market, according to Ganesh Adhikari, chief of the Agriculture Development Office, Dolpa.“Roads are usually closed during the apple harvest, which is a big problem,” said Adhikari. “Many farmers store their apples using traditional methods. If the apples don’t decay, traders take them to markets like Nepalgunj and Surkhet.”Adhikari said apple production has increased this season, with output reaching 4,000 tonnes.In Simkot, the headquarters of Humla, apples have been planted on 518 hectares. Last year, the district produced 4,224 tonnes of apples, but none reached the market. Although a road network reached Simikot in March this year, transportation is completely stalled in Humla leaving farmers unable to sell their fruits.“The road has reached Simikot, but it has been three months since no vehicles have been operating. Some farmers use mules to transport apples, worried that the fruit will decay,” said Dasharath Rokaya, an apple farmer in ward 7 of Simkot rural municipality. “Shipping apples by air costs more than the fruit is worth,” he said.Rokaya said that apples go to waste every year due to a lack of roads. His orchard, which spans 25 ropani (1.27 hectares), has 150 apple trees. The cost to transport a kilo of apple from Humla to Nepalgunj by air is Rs130. And from Humla to Surkhet, it costs Rs120 per kg.Nimayangjum Lama of Bargaun in ward 3 of Simkot rural municipality, has set up a storage using traditional methods to keep apples for a month. “Nobody comes to buy in bulk. Though I store the apples, half of them decay,” she said.According to Lama, 25 big apple farms are operating in Simkot village. She said that apples are sent through flight only when the passenger takes them as gifts.Currently, an apple fetches up to Rs10. High quality apples produced in the upper reaches of Tilgufa municipality in Kalikot also go to waste.“There is a bumper production this year, but there is no road to transport them,” bemoaned Dhan Bahadur Shahi, a local farmer of Chilkhaya in Kalikot. “The high transport costs are another issue that farmers say do not cover the cost of production.”Last year, Shahi produced 42 tonnes of apples, but this season, output dropped to 30 tonnes as a hailstorm damaged the plants. His orchard has 500 apple trees. Sending apples to the Tarai cities through the Karnali highway using porters costs Rs10 per kg.In recent years, farmers in Phoimahadev, Chilkhaya, Rachuli, Jubitha, Chappre, Odanku of Mahabai, Gela, Mugraha of Subhakalika, Sukatiya, and Bharta of Kalikot have been engaged in commercial farming of apples.Although vehicles can reach the village from Nagma and Rachuli Bazar during winter, roads are generally obstructed during the rainy season, causing many problems for the farmers, said Parek Bahadur Shahi, a farmer from Jubetha.“Traders with their vehicles can reach farmers’ orchards in Jumla. If the road could operate round-the-year, all the apples could reach the market,” Parek said. “It is difficult for us to take our produce to the market, and on top of that, we don’t get fair prices for our products.”He said the village's lack of cold storage, packaging, and grading facilities forces farmers to harvest apples before they ripen. “Apples are sold for Rs45 per kg in the village.”Last year, 5,860 tonnes of apples were produced across 605 hectares in Kalikot.According to statistics from the Karnali province’s Ministry of Land Management, Agriculture and Cooperatives, apple is being grown on 3,419 hectares across all districts of the province except Surkhet. Last year, Karnali produced 31,000 tonnes of apples, and the production is expected to be around the same this year, said Dhan Bahadur Kathayet, spokesperson of the Land Management Ministry. He said storage problems, lack of grading, road access, and packaging contribute to the low market value of Karnali apples.Farmers are currently selling apples for Rs50 per kg. In Surkhet, a kilo of apples costs Rs125, while in Kathmandu, it reaches Rs250, Kathayat said. “With the lack of well-managed marketing, farmers are getting less value for their product, while consumers are compelled to pay high prices. Only traders and middlemen benefit.”Trucks carrying food and construction materials from Surkhet and Nepalgunj are returning with apples from Jumla, Mugu, and Kalikot.Among other districts in Karnali, Jumla produces 12,500 tonnes of apples on 3,100 hectares. While Jumla has long been renowned for its apples, the trend of commercial farming has been growing in recent years in the district.Min Bahadur Bhandari from ward 5 of Guthichaur rural municipality in Jumla has invested Rs220 million in his apple farm, which has 48,000 plants. The orchard produced 80 tonnes of apples last year. He said traders are visiting his farm to buy apples.Bhandari aims to produce 200 tonnes of apples this season. Tanka Giri of ward 3 of Guthichaur has planted 14,000 apple trees on 22 hectares with an investment of Rs70 million. It has been two years since he started apple cultivation.“There was no road in the past. When we couldn’t take those apples to the market, they were often fed to animals,” Giri said. “But now the demand for Jumla apples has reached international markets, and this has encouraged us to invest.”“Roads have been obstructed frequently for years,” said Karna Bahadur Budhathoki, a trader from Jumla. “A single day of halt in the transportation can spoil apples worth hundreds and thousands of rupees.”Budhathoki said that around 3 tonnes of apples that he purchased were spoiled. Currently, he is buying apples from farmers at Rs50 per kg. It costs an additional Rs20 per kg, which includes the cost of packaging the apples in cartons and transportation to Surkhet and Nepalgunj. \nPrime Minister KP Sharma Oli has requested with the Japanese government for the reconstruction of the BP Highway, many sections of which were damaged by the recent floods and landslides.The highway, which is the shortest route to connect some Tarai districts and eastern part of the country with the capital city Kathmandu, was built by the government of Japan. Prime Minister Oli made the request during a meeting with Japanese Ambassador Kikuta Yutaka on Wednesday, according to two officials present at the meeting.“The recent floods and landslides have badly damaged the BP Highway and it would take a huge amount of money and technical resources to rebuild it,” Oli told ambassador Kikuta, according to the officials. “So we want Japanese support once again.”An official said that Nepal drew the attention of the Japanese side and that now it is up to them to respond. “Though we have already carried out the relief work, opening of the track among other technical works remains,” the official said.During the meeting, the two sides discussed repairing the BP Highway, some sections of which are badly damaged by the recent floods and landslides, a statement issued by the prime minister’s private secretariat said. “Possible Japanese support to rebuild the highway was also discussed,” it stated.Besides Prime Minister Oli, secretary at the Ministry of Physical Infrastructure and Transportation Keshav Kumar Sharma, and joint secretary at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Krishna Prasad Dhakal, among other officials, were present at the meeting.The recent floods and landslides have completely damaged over 12 kilometres of the highway. As the vehicular movement on the shortest route to reach the eastern part of the country including some Tarai districts was halted due to the floods and landslides just ahead of Dashain festival, the government opened a temporary track to resume the highway only for light vehicles.Since reconstruction work is underway, the local Kavrepalanchok district administration has stopped vehicles plying during night time from Wednesday.In the meeting with the Japanese ambassador, Oli described the situation across the BP Highway and steps taken by the government, officials said. Oli added that the government is expecting technical and financial support from the Japanese government.According to the government assessment, it might need Rs20–25 billion for rebuilding the highway.During the time of the earthquake in 2015, some parts of the highway were damaged and the government of Japan had extended the financial and technical support, Oli told the ambassador. “Now we need a similar kind of support from the Japanese side,” Oli added.The Japanese ambassador, while expressing grief over recent damage caused by the floods and landslides, stated that he will communicate the matter to Tokyo.His response was diplomatic to the prime minister’s request, according to the officials who attended the meeting.A formal request will also be sent to the government of Japan seeking its support for rebuilding the highway, the officials said. \nWeena Pun is the author of ‘Kanchhi’ (2024), now available in bookstores across Nepal. She graduated from Stanford University and the MFA Program in Creative Writing at Cornell University. Pun currently lives in Maryland, the US. In this conversation with the Post’s Rishika Dhakal, Pun discusses her debut novel, inspired by the struggles of women in Nepal and the socio-political landscape that shapes their lives.What is your novel Kanchhi about?In a nutshell, Kanchhi is about a girl who goes missing and her mother who awaits her return. But it’s also about the hamlet Kanchhi is from, its people, its culture and the socio-political reasons Kanchhi disappears. Quiet in the background is the story of Nepal itself, just as ambitious as Kanchhi, longing for something bigger than the state it is in.How did you develop the characters in your novel? Are they purely fictional?Meticulously. I developed the characters by drafting scenes after scenes, by having the characters interact with each other, by researching them or their like in the real world, by digging deep into my own memory bank—basically, by just writing. What I just did here is describe the writing process. That’s the only way, I think. You just have to sit down and write and get a feel for the characters as you continue to suss out the story. The characters are purely fictional and not. I mean you are not going to find the characters as they are in the book in real life, but then there are also a lot of people who are very much like the characters in the novel. I think that happens because the process of creating a character involves memory, imagination and research, including observation. Even if you are molding the character after someone you know or an approximation of someone you know, the very act of imagining that character and then describing them and what they do in such a way that fits the story and pushes it forward make them fictional. It's not easy. In Kanchhi, you explore themes of rebellion, family and social expectations. What inspired you to focus on these particular themes and how do they resonate with modern day issues in Nepal? To be honest, I did not really focus on these themes. I think they just made themselves known because I am a woman from Nepal writing about women in Nepal—rebelling against family and societal pressures just comes with the territory for us. I think these themes will definitely resonate with modern day issues in Nepal because we are not that far from the turn of the millennium, the period in which my novel takes place. Unfortunately, women in Nepal today are dogged by the same issues that my characters grappled with in the 80s, 90s, and 00s. From being told to act like a girl to not laugh like a girl to policing sexuality to discriminatory citizenship clauses in the constitution—things haven’t really changed, have they?How has your journalistic background influenced your fiction writing, especially in creating a narrative that is both engaging and clear?I’m not sure. I was a fiction writer long before I was a reporter, even though my fiction publication record was non-existent at the time I joined the Post in 2013. I had, however, already begun work on the novel, and from my times writing sporadically on it, I knew I had a lot of work to do. For one, I needed to know Nepal better, and two, I needed to sharpen my interviewing skills so that I could know Nepal better. I was very shy then and scared of approaching people with questions. Reporting took those worries away and taught me that no question was stupid if you were searching for the truth. This is to say that yes, journalism must have definitely helped me with my fiction writing. I’m just not sure if it made my writing more engaging or clearer. What it definitely did was help me be able to talk to people and find things out and help me get a good overview of the larger, socio-political issues at play in the country—issues that one way or another affected my characters in rural Nepal.Gender dynamics are a significant part of Kanchhi. With the book shedding light on the societal pressures women face, what do you think is the role of literature in challenging or reflecting these gender norms in Nepali society? The role of literature in reflecting gender norms in Nepali society is unavoidable, even when it’s a man writing a story that on the surface has nothing to do with gender dynamics. The inclusion, exclusion and the nature of inclusion and exclusion of women in literature say a lot about gender norms, roles and perceptions in the society that the work of literature is based in. Now, the writer might not set out to reflect these realities, but it just happens. When you write about the society you know, you end up showing it a mirror. Whether the work of literature might end up challenging the prevalent gender norms, though, depends upon the writer and the nature of work itself because challenging something requires deliberation, requires effort, and not every writer is up for that. But then, maybe if you are not up for that, you are not producing a genuine work of literature? But then what is a genuine work of literature? I don’t know. I’ll have to think harder on this.In recent years, there has been a growing interest in global literature from Nepal. What do you think is driving this increasing attention to Nepali stories and what role does Kanchhi play in this trend?My reading on this is that the writers who were born in the 80s and grew up in the 90s during that wave of economic liberalization, globalization and the start of the multi-party democracy in Nepal have now come of age. These writers grew up learning English in ‘boarding’ schools, grew up reading global literature written in or translated into English, and grew up practicing their constitutionally protected right to freedom of speech. Meaning, we are now more than ready to engage with global literature, talk to it or at it, and tell our own stories. I think the interest is only going to grow, as more Nepalis become fluent in the language of global literature. As for where Kanchhi fits in all this—I think it fits squarely in there. Kanchhi is an attempt to tell a story of a girl in rural Nepal in English by a woman from Nepal who grew up reading world literature in the 90s and the early 2000s and who always wanted to see her own stories reflected in it. I, and by extension Kanchhi, are a product of our times.What do you hope readers will remember about Kanchhi? For some reason, this is a really hard question. Let me try answering this by telling you an anecdote about how I had felt when I first read Arundhati Roy’s The God of Small Things. I read the book in 2005 when I was in my second year of A-levels. What wowed me the most about the book was the fact that it was about a South Asian country written by a South Asian writer, written in English and written very well. Something I had not realized was possible or had forgotten that it was possible since we did read R. K. Narayan in English classes. So, my point is, I remember that feeling of wonder when I first read The God of Small Things, and while I am no Arundhati Roy and Kanchhi is not The God of Small Things, I still hope that my readers are able to find something in Kanchhi that they can cherish forever.Weena Pun’s book recommendationsThe Copenhagen Trilogy by Tove Ditlevson: An amazing series of memoirs that talks about the working-class life as it is. No exoticization, no romanticization, no beseeching for pity, no triumphalist narrative. Just a narration of life as it was. The Things They Carried by Tim O’Brien: This is an exceptional account of the Vietnam War told like it was—a theme emerging here. I return to this book every once in a while, to remember what a fast-paced, honest fiction feels like. This Boy’s Life by Tobias Wolff: Another memoir but reads like fiction. The details and the pacing here are just absolutely amazing. Makes me want to write about my life like that.How to Love Your Daughter by Hila Blum: Plotwise, nothing happens, but the writing (even in translation, which is what I read) is exquisite. The anguish of a mother who cannot bear that her daughter has chosen to be estranged from her is all over the book but is never maudlin. Wish I had come across this book while I was drafting Kanchhi—or maybe not.Mothers and Others by Sarah Blaffer Hrdy: When I was a new mother (yup, motherhood is another theme here) and wracked with fear and anxiety, this anthropological work pulled me through. It let me know indirectly that my anxiety was normal and had an evolutionary basis and therefore benefits. This online version of the interview has been edited for clarity  \nThe Supreme Court has ordered senior advocate Gopal Krishna Ghimire, president of the Nepal Bar Association, to submit a written response within seven days regarding a contempt of court case against him.The top court progressed with the contempt proceedings based on the case filed by the Supreme Court’s Deputy Registrar, Govind Prasad Ghimire, alleging contempt against the Bar President. During the hearing on Thursday, a bench comprising Justices Kumar Regmi and Kumar Chudal directed Ghimire to file a written response within the stipulated time frame.“If there are any grounds for not issuing the order as requested by the petitioner, provide evidence along with a response in writing either personally or through a legal representative within seven days from the date of receiving this notice, in addition to submitting a copy of the petition,” the apex court said.On September 27, the Judicial Council nominated two high court chief judges as Supreme Court justices despite lawyers’ sit-in on the council premises, protesting against the nominations. Ghimire, the NBA president, had criticised the nominations, accusing the council of selecting the two judges in exchange for money.Deputy Registrar Ghimire filed the petition at the court on September 30 demanding legal action against the NBA president. \nThe top leaders of Nepal’s three major political parties have agreed to expedite the formation of the search committee to recommend candidates for the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) and the Commission of Investigation on Enforced Disappeared Persons as soon as possible. During a meeting held at the Prime Minister’s residence in Baluwatar on Thursday, the leaders decided to fast-track the remaining tasks of the peace process.Leaders from the Nepali Congress, the CPN-UML, and the Maoist Centre agreed to give full shape to the search committee entrusted to select heads and members of the commissions, said Shakti Basnet, a deputy general secretary of the Maoist Centre. The next Cabinet meeting, scheduled for Friday, is expected to give full shape to the search committee.“The Cabinet will decide the members of the search committee in its upcoming meeting, accelerating the formation of both the TRC and the Commission of Investigation on Enforced Disappeared Persons,” a source close to the prime minister stated.Prime Minister and CPN-UML Chairman KP Sharma Oli, Nepali Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba, and Maoist Centre Chairman Pushpa Kamal Dahal, who is also leader of the main opposition in the House, were present at the meeting. Other leaders in attendance included Home Minister Ramesh Lekhak, Maoist Centre’s Basnet, and Attorney General Ramesh Badal.Basnet added that Thursday’s meeting agreed to finalise the search committee, which had been initiated by his party chair, Dahal, when he was prime minister before being replaced by Oli in mid-July.“The meeting to expedite the remaining tasks of the peace process follows the decision made during Maoist Centre chair Dahal’s premiership. The parties had agreed to form a search committee to select candidates for the two commissions,” Basnet said.Previously, the Parliament passed a bill related to transitional justice, which was ratified by the President on August 29. The House of Representatives passed the bill on August 14, followed by its approval by the National Assembly on August 22.The two commissions have been paralysed since July 2022 after the government decided to extend their terms without retaining their chairmen and members. \nMinister for Culture, Tourism, and Civil Aviation Badri Prasad Pandey has instructed the Pashupati Area Development Trust (PADT) to suspend all activities related to vacating the Gaushala Dharmashala.As the chairperson of PADT, Pandey issued the directive on Wednesday, citing concerns over security in the area, according to a letter from the ministry addressed to the PADT.Pandey has also called for a PADT Executive Council meeting on Sunday at the Ministry of Culture, Tourism, and Civil Aviation to discuss the issue, PADT spokesperson Rewati Raman Adhikari said.The dispute over the management of Gaushala Dharmashala escalated after the PADT, on Tuesday, accused Marwadi Sewa Samiti of seeking to acquire the land on which the pilgrims’ shelter stands, located northwest of the Gaushala crossroads.On May 23, 2003, the Trust and the Samiti reached an agreement that allowed the Samiti to manage the property for an annual rent of Rs51,000. However, in recent years, PADT has requested an increase in the nominal rent, which the Samiti refused.In response, the Trust terminated the two-decade-old agreement on August 2, 2023, and decided to reclaim the 9.5 ropani (0.48 hectares) of land and infrastructure. It also handed over the responsibility of managing the property to the Kathmandu Metropolitan City.Challenging this decision, the Samiti took the matter to the Kathmandu District Court. However, on October 2, the court dismissed the case, ruling that the Samiti had failed to substantiate its claims.Following the court’s decision, the trust and the metropolis began efforts to take possession of the property, but they have faced resistance from individuals linked to the Samiti, a charitable organisation of the Marwadi community.The Samiti obstructed the metropolis’ attempt to claim the property on Tuesday, as well as during a previous attempt on October 9. Due to continued resistance, the metropolis administration has sought assistance from the District Administration Office, Kathmandu. Meanwhile, the Trust held a press briefing to clarify its stance.The PADT has stated that the property will be used solely for religious purposes. However, it is currently rented out for operating hotels, lodges, and restaurants, among other businesses. \nThe federal government has recommended immediate grants of Rs5 million to 10 million to each of the 71 local units declared disaster crisis zones. The financial assistance is aimed at providing relief and carrying out rehabilitation, and reconstruction works in the disaster-affected areas.In a meeting on Thursday, the executive committee of the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Authority (NDRRMA) proposed the grants in line with the declaration of these 71 local units as disaster-hit zones. The government on October 4 had declared 71 local units in 20 districts as disaster crisis zones.The local units declared disaster crisis zones are from Okhaldhunga, Panchthar, Udaypur, Solukhumbu, Khotang, Ilam, Kavrepalanchok, Lalitpur, Dolakha, Sindhuli, Sindhupalchok, Makawanpur, Dhading, Ramechhap, Chitwan, Rautahat, Mahottari, Sarlahi, Siraha and Saptari districts.The meeting chaired by Home Minister Ramesh Lekhak on Thursday decided that nine of the worst-hit local units would receive Rs10 million each, 12 affected units would get Rs7.5 million each, and the remaining 50 units would be provided with Rs5 million each, according to NDRRMA Spokesperson Dijan Bhattarai.The proposal will now be forwarded to the National Council for Disaster Management, chaired by Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli, in a meeting scheduled for Friday.According to Bhattarai, the allocated funds will be used to restore essential services and purchase supplies such as foods and tarpaulins for relief and rescue operations.Additionally, the meeting decided to allocate a budget for procuring helicopters and equipment needed for disaster rescue operations. It also resolved to request the government to offer free health insurance to the families of those who lost their lives in disaster-related incidents through the Council.In addition to Home Minister Lekhak, Health Minister Pradeep Paudel and Minister for Federal Affairs and General Administration Rajkumar Gupta also attended the meeting. Incessant rainfall on September 27 and 28 ravaged various parts of the country including the Kathmandu Valley. At least 244 people were confirmed dead and 19 people remained unaccounted for during the disasters.  \nNepalese politicians have colluded with businessmen for mutual benefits, as seen when CPN-UML leader KP Sharma Oli accepted land for party headquarters from Min Bahadur Gurung, raising questions of corruption and favoritism.\nPre-1990 news media focused excessively on the royal family, neglecting important national issues, a trend that continued with Prime Minister Oli's recent US visit, where university speeches were inflated in importance while substantive news was downplayed.\nAI risks such as mass automation, digital divides, and privacy violations are emerging, especially in the Global South, requiring solutions like education investments, digital infrastructure expansion, and regulatory frameworks to mitigate risks and ensure inclusivity.\nDespite constitutional guarantees, Nepali women face high maternal mortality rates due to inadequate health care infrastructure, lack of skilled birth attendants, and weak implementation of policies, resulting in preventable deaths during childbirth.\nNepal's women's football team aims to break their title jinx in the SAFF Women's Championship, facing challenges from India and defending champions Bangladesh in Group B.\nThe world’s largest technology firms are flocking to Southeast Asia to build data centres at a time when demand for infrastructure and computing power to enable artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly rising.The new investments are expected to contribute to the region’s economies by creating skilled jobs in data centre construction, engineering and maintenance, while also developing specialised talent in AI, cyber security, and data science and management.The investments will also improve the region’s digital infrastructure, allowing small businesses and large institutions to store their data locally, significantly reducing downtime while increasing data sovereignty.With AI-supported innovations such as searches on ChatGPT now requiring at least four to five times more processing capacity compared with traditional internet searches, data centre demand is expected to grow at around 20 per cent a year for the next five to seven years, analysts at Maybank noted in an October report.Data centres are large facilities built to accommodate servers, data storage systems and networking equipment that support better internet services and telecommunications.This, in turn, enables popular online activities such as gaming, live-streaming and investing, as well as more advanced technologies like cloud computing and AI.Thanks to its lower costs, power availability and geopolitical neutrality, South-east Asia is emerging as an ideal region for tech operators to establish a data centre base, with the top five countries being Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia and Vietnam.While Singapore is the preferred destination for hosting data centres due to superior infrastructure and a stable regulatory regime, the Republic had imposed a three-year halt on data centre construction between 2019 and 2022 to assess its impact on the environment.Malaysia seized the bulk of new data centre investments entering the region during that period, and now expects facilities with around one gigawatt (GW) of power capacity to come online over the next two years.That is double the existing data centre capacity it currently has.Another 3GW has also been announced and, if approved, will be gradually rolled out in the next three to five years, RHB Bank said.In comparison, Singapore’s data centre capacity currently stands at around 1.4GW.Among those channelling capital into Malaysia are tech titans like Microsoft, which said in May that it will invest US$2.2 billion (S$2.9 billion) over the next four years to build cloud and AI infrastructure in the country.Amazon Web Services (AWS) in August announced plans to invest an estimated US$6.2 billion to set up a data centre and cloud region in Malaysia.More On This TopicSingapore has one of the world’s densest data centre capacities: Josephine TeoMalaysia plans national cloud policy, AI regulations as Google breaks ground on $2.57b data centreThe cloud service provider is also developing a similar region in Thailand. It revealed plans in 2024 to invest US$5 billion in data centres in the country over the next few years, making Thailand its fourth AWS region in Asean after Singapore, Indonesia and Malaysia.In September, Google said it would invest US$1 billion to build a data centre and cloud region in Thailand, which has so far seen around US$9 billion committed by operators, according to analysts at Morgan Stanley.By 2028, RHB expects Malaysia to account for over half the data centre processing power across the top five South-east Asian markets, with data centres in Johor making up the bulk of inventories at over 2.3GW.That could put the Malaysian state in close competition with Singapore as a data centre hub for the region.After partially lifting its moratorium in 2022, Singapore awarded around 80MW of new capacity to Equinix, GDS, Microsoft and an AirTrunk-ByteDance consortium in July 2023. In May, the Government announced that at least 300MW of data centre capacity may soon be provided.Still, the Republic has signalled that it will be more selective when awarding new capacity moving forward.Speaking at a conference in May, then Senior Minister of State for Communications and Information Janil Puthucheary said data centres are collectively Singapore’s biggest indirect carbon emitter.He added that existing data centres currently contribute to 82 per cent of the information and communications sector’s carbon emissions, and 7 per cent of the country’s total electricity consumption.However, Dr Janil said Singapore may still award an additional 200MW of capacity to operators that are able to tap green sources of energy to run the facilities, and will provide schemes and incentives to support such investments.Mr Dedi Iskandar, head of data centre solutions at property investment adviser CBRE, asked that the authorities provide more clarity on this front.“The industry does not have a clear picture of what’s next after the additional capacity was announced in May, or when we can bid or how. We haven’t seen this information coming, and that has created uncertainty,” he said.“When data centre operators have no line of sight, they cannot make plans to invest in Singapore.”Mr Dedi said that while Singapore is still the preferred destination for hosting mission-critical computing applications, Johor, which still struggles with issues like talent and water shortages, is improving quickly.The highest risk for Singapore arises when the price gap for building and operating a data centre compared with Johor becomes too significant, and when the quality of data centre services between the two markets narrows, he said. \nLiam Payne, former One Direction singer, died after falling from a third-floor hotel balcony in Buenos Aires, leaving fans, family, and music industry in mourning.\nCanadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Wednesday said India made “a horrific mistake” by thinking it could interfere as aggressively as it allegedly did in Canada’s sovereignty.Trudeau made the remark two days after Canada kicked out six Indian diplomats, linking them to the murder of a Sikh separatist leader in Canada and alleging a broader effort to target Indian dissidents in the country.The Canadian leader’s comments were the strongest he has made in a year-long dispute that plunged bilateral relations to a new low.“The Indian government made a horrific mistake in thinking that they could interfere as aggressively as they did in the safety and sovereignty of Canada,” he told an independent probe into foreign interference in Canadian politics.Trudeau said Ottawa could take further steps to ensure Canadians’ security but declined to give details.India denies the allegations of interference and has expelled six Canadian diplomats in a tit-for-tat move. \nIn his final months in office, President Joe Biden is signaling new willingness to use US military assistance to Israel as both a carrot and a stick to influence its high-stakes confrontation with Iran and Iran-backed militant groups.But while the approach increases Washington’s involvement in Israeli decision-making just weeks before the US presidential election, it is unclear whether it will help achieve Biden’s goals, including preventing a broader regional conflict and getting Israel to address the increasingly dire humanitarian situation in Gaza, experts say.Biden’s administration announced on Sunday it would send about 100 soldiers to Israel along with an advanced US anti-missile system, a rare deployment that came as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s government weighs a retaliatory attack on Iran after an Oct. 1 Iranian missile strike.The Biden administration also delivered Israel a letter on Sunday warning that it must take steps in the next month to improve the humanitarian situation in Gaza or face potential restrictions on US military aidBiden’s administration announced on Sunday it would send about 100 soldiers to Israel along with an advanced US anti-missile system, a rare deployment that came as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s government weighs a retaliatory attack on Iran after an Oct. 1 Iranian missile strike.The Biden administration also delivered Israel a letter on Sunday warning that it must take steps in the next month to improve the humanitarian situation in Gaza or face potential restrictions on US military aid.Publicly, US officials say the seemingly opposing moves fit within longstanding policies that aim to both ensure Israel’s defense and to advocate for protection of civilians in the year-old war in Gaza.But current and former officials privately acknowledge that they are milestones that increase US involvement in Israeli strategy even as Biden heads for the door.Israel has frequently resisted US advice and has caused political difficulties for the Biden administration, which faces pressure from some liberal activists in the Democratic Party to use US leverage to rein in Israel.Aaron David Miller, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said that the administration’s carrot-and-stick approach “implies at a time when you might not think the administration is all that active … that they are clearly thinking and acting.”But he cautioned that Washington is unlikely to scale back its military support for Israel if the conflict with Iran deepens.“It is almost inconceivable to me as we approach the possibility of a severe and serious escalation – the Israeli response and what the Iranians will do in return – that this administration could consider anything like a serious restriction or conditioning of military systems,” he said.White House spokesperson John Kirby told reporters on Tuesday that the letter was not “meant as a threat” but that it appears the Israelis are taking the issues seriously.An Israeli official in Washington said: “The letter has been received and is being thoroughly reviewed by Israeli security officials.”Israel said Wednesday that 50 aid trucks were transferred to north Gaza from Jordan, a possible early result of the US demands.A DEADLINE TO INCREASE AIDBiden has prioritized Israel’s defense since Hamas militants triggered the war by killing some 1,200 people, according to Israeli figures. He refused to halt weapons flows to Israel, except for 2,000-pound bombs, despite outcry by fellow Democrats as Israel’s war in Gaza killed 42,000 people, according to Palestinian health authorities.The administration in April demanded better protections for civilians and aid workers in Gaza, which US officials say produced a temporary rise in aid flows into the territory.But Sunday’s letter appeared to be the clearest ultimatum yet to Netanyahu’s government since the Gaza conflict began, outlining specific steps Israel must take within 30 days, including enabling a minimum of 350 trucks with aid to enter Gaza per day.It raises the possibility of Washington making Israel ineligible to receive US weapons over its restrictions on aid delivery, said John Ramming Chappell, advocacy and legal advisor at the Center for Civilians in Conflict.“It is a small step towards a very significant change,” he said.Netanyahu convened an emergency meeting on Wednesday to discuss expanding humanitarian aid to Gaza, three officials who attended the discussion said, with aid likely to increase soon.The decision to send the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense system, or THAAD, is a similarly major step, said former officials and analysts, in line with a strategy of offering the Israelis close military support with the aim of influencing how they conduct military operations.A former defense official described the deployment as a “paradigm shift,” given Israel’s long-standing security doctrine to defend itself, by itself. It also raises the stakes, potentially, for the United States.“The US is putting actual US ‘skin in the game’ by placing US forces inside Israel, that only 2 weeks ago was on the receiving end of 180 Iranian ballistic missiles,” the official said.The Middle East has been on edge awaiting Israel’s response to a missile attack earlier this month that Tehran carried out in retaliation for Israel’s military escalation in Lebanon.Biden has objected to any Israeli strike on Iran’s nuclear sites and expressed concern about a strike on energy sites.“This is probably a carrot to try to cajole the Israelis to not go big,” said Thomas Karako, director of the missile defense project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, referring to the possibility that Israel could choose to strike nuclear and other targets.“And, you know, you don’t send a multi-billion dollar asset without some strings attached.”The White House did not directly respond to a question on whether sending the THAAD to Israel may have been part of a deal for the Israelis to agree not to hit Iranian oil or nuclear sites.Time is running short for the administration.The 30 days Biden has given Israel to comply with its demands will run out after the Nov. 5 US election, giving Netanyahu the ability to decide how fully he should comply, said Miller, especially if the Republican candidate with whom he is close, former President Donald Trump, defeats the Democrat, Vice President Kamala Harris.“Netanyahu believes he is at the point of maximum leverage, and he may well be. You may have a new president-elect that is much more to his liking in a matter of weeks,” Miller added. \nThe weather is forecast to be partly to generally cloudy in the hilly areas of the country on Thursday with partly cloudy to mainly fair weather elsewhere. According to the Meteorological Forecasting Division, light to moderate rain is likely in a few places in Gandaki Province and at one or two locations in the hilly regions of Koshi Province, Bagmati Province, Karnali Province, and Sudurpaschim Province.Tonight, the weather will remain partly to generally cloudy in the hilly regions of Koshi, Gandaki, and Sudurpaschim provinces, while the rest of the country will see partly cloudy to fair skies. Light rain is expected at one or two places in the hilly regions of these provinces.According to the meteorological analysis, the country is currently experiencing a partial influence of western winds, along with some local wind effects in the hilly areas of Koshi, Bagmati, and Gandaki provinces.On Wednesday, the maximum temperature was recorded at 34.7°C in Janakpur, while the minimum was 4.3°C in Jumla. Dharan received the highest rainfall of 39.0 mm in the past 24 hours. \nStudents who fail the Secondary Education Examination (SEE) tests can now pursue pre-diploma courses in both technical and non-technical categories.The Council for Technical Education and Vocational Training (CTEVT) opened admission in various pre-diploma courses targeting non-graded students. Students failing to secure a minimum of 1.60 Grade Point Average (GPA) are categorised as non-graded and thus ineligible to study grade 11. However, they can now pursue several pre-diploma courses, opening the door for higher studies, mainly in technical subjects.The council, making a public call on Wednesday, opened admission to 25 different pre-diploma courses. Students can choose two pre-diploma courses in hotel management, three in agriculture and animal husbandry, 17 in engineering, and one each in social mobilisation, internship development, and computer application and secretariat management. All the courses span 18 months.“The council has revised the admission directives [to allow the non-graded to study pre-diploma courses],” reads the admission notice.Students clearing pre-diploma courses are eligible to study the diploma courses that are equivalent to grade 12.As many as 242,313 students—52.13 percent of the total examinees—had been categorised as non-graded in the SEE results published the last week of June. The number of total examinees stood at 464,785.Earlier, only those who were non-graded in a maximum of two subjects were eligible to take such examinations.This criteria was later changed and a decision was made allowing students who received non-graded in up to seven subjects or those who were absent in the regular exams to take the grade improvement exam.For the first time, the education ministry under Sumana Shrestha allowed all the non-graded students to sit for supplementary tests.Of the 210,321 who appeared in the grade increment test, 119,425 were graded, becoming eligible to study grade 11. Of them were 56,702 boys, 62,721 girls, and two in the ‘others’ category.Over 35,000 non-graded students didn't wish to take the supplementary tests held in August.As many as 122,888 non-graded students will be benefited from the decision to allow them to study the pre-diploma course.The eighth amendment to the Education Act restructured schools to include classes from early childhood to Grade 12 as part of the school level. However, the Grade 10 exam continues in the same format as the previous School Leaving Certificate exams.Amid high failure rate at SEE, the incumbent KP Sharma Oli government has announced that it is working to ensure that 70 percent students graduate the grade 10 examinations. The upcoming tests will be held in March next year. \nAmid widespread deaths and devastation caused by monsoon across various districts, Nepal is at a heightened risk for water-borne, vector-borne, and air-borne disease outbreaks.With most water sources contaminated by rain and floodwater, and thousands of displaced people living in makeshift shelters, experts have warned of a potential surge in infections in the coming days.“People are already getting infected with water-borne, vector-borne and air-borne diseases,” said Dr Sher Bahadur Pun, chief of the Clinical Research Unit at Sukraraj Tropical and Infectious Disease Hospital. “These problems could worsen in the coming days.” At least 209 people have been confirmed dead, while 29 others are still missing due to the floods and landslides triggered by record-breaking torrential rainfall that started Thursday evening. Additionally, 142 people have sustained various degrees of injury, and more than 4,222 others have been taken to safe places, the Home Ministry said on Monday evening. Doctors warn that the risk of water-borne, vector-borne and air-borne disease outbreaks increases in the aftermath of disasters. Nepal’s past experiences suggest the same.“People are already contracting cholera and other water-borne diseases,” said Dr Pun. “As displaced people mostly live in temporary shelters, the chances of spread of air-borne and vector-borne diseases remain high.”At least 95 people from various districts, including from Kathmandu and Lalitpur, have tested positive for cholera since the start of the monsoon in June. The Vibrio cholera 01 Ogawa serotype has been confirmed in the stool samples of the infected patients. Thousands of others were also infected with diarrheal infections after the start of the monsoon season. Diarrhoeal disease is a common and seasonal public health issue, usually triggered by unsafe food and water or hygiene issues. Likewise, six people died, and 12,644 others were hospitalised this year due to dengue, which has spread to 76 out of 77 districts across the country. Hundreds of people are contracting seasonal flu, but health authorities have no records of these cases.Officials at the Ministry of Health and Population said that they are bracing for tough days ahead, as the floodwaters not only contaminate drinking water sources but also create breeding grounds for various disease-spreading vectors.“We expect a surge in water-borne, vector-borne and air-borne diseases in the coming days, as it takes a few days for these illnesses to incubate,” said Dr Yadu Chandra Ghimire, director at the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division. “We have alerted all agencies concerned to step up vigilance and prepare to deal with any adverse situations.”Public health experts have warned that healthcare facilities in the disaster-hit districts could witness an uptick in cases of viral fever cases and waterborne diseases—diarrhoea, dysentery, food poisoning—and snakebites.Health Ministry officials say that they are aware of the risks and have directed agencies concerned to prepare accordingly.“We have stockpiled essential medicines in districts, provinces and at the central level,” said Dr Roshan Pokhrel, the secretary at the ministry. “Responding to the looming outbreaks is not only the responsibility of the Health Ministry, but also of other ministries and agencies, and we have been coordinating with them as well.”In addition to stepping up surveillance measures, stockpiling medicines, and deploying medics at the health facilities in disaster-hit areas, public health experts emphasise the importance of health awareness in reducing infections.They say a combination of careful surveys, ensuring safe drinking water, maintaining hygiene and sanitation, social mobilisation and treatment are required to contain the possible outbreaks of various ailments.The monsoon in Nepal is itself a season of epidemics with thousands of people across the country getting infected with water-borne and vector-borne diseases.The country is one of the world’s most vulnerable to the climate crisis and has witnessed extreme weather events over the past decade and a half.Evidence suggests that the maximum temperature in Nepal is rising at a greater rate (0.056 degrees Celsius per year) than the global average of 0.03 degrees Celsius per year.Experts say extreme weather events—excess rainfall in a short period, continuous rains for several days after the monsoon, dry spells, droughts, below-average precipitation, and above-normal winter temperatures—have become more frequent in Nepal.In recent years, scientists have gathered credible evidence linking the climate crisis to adverse health effects that impact the quality of life and kill people. \nAs the festive season approaches, prices of daily essentials like rice, edible oil, legumes, and lentils have increased.Retailers say food prices are expected to stay high throughout Dashain and Tihar, Nepal’s biggest festivals.In Nepal, food prices are heavily influenced by the Indian market. Even though prices have not increased in India, some opportunist traders have been taking advantage of the poor market monitoring to increase prices under different pretexts. For example, on September 14, India raised the basic import tax on crude and refined edible oils by 20 percent. Nepali importers seized this opportunity to hike their prices even though Nepal had not raised the import tax.Dhurba Prasad Adhikari, joint treasurer of the Nepal Retailers Association, said Nepali wholesalers and retailers have already raised the prices. “It has been a week since edible oil price was increased by Rs20 per litre and the price is expected to increase further as the festive demand kicks in,” he said. But he admits that market rumours and weak inspections make prices more unstable, especially during the festive season when demand is at its peak.According to the association, sunflower oil prices have increased from Rs190 to Rs210 per litre. Likewise, the per litre price of mustard oil has gone up from Rs350 to Rs370.Adhikari, who operates Adhikari Khadya Store, said the price of edible oil is expected to increase in Tihar due to high demand.Retailers said strict inspections in large trading houses could help stabilise prices during the festive season. Consumer rights activists say the current government inspections of the market are just for show and will not address issues related to price, quality, and quantity.“The government’s market inspection body is looking only at retail markets. They, too, know this will not change prices unless they also inspect the warehouses of large importers and traders,” Adhikari said. He said that the government inspecting body needs to check on the stock of goods held by traders.According to retailers, even with the new rice harvesting beginning soon, prices of the staple have increased by Rs100 kg for a 25 kg bag.Even the price of sona mansuli, which normally remains at Rs60 per kg, has now inched up to Rs70 to Rs75 per kg.Rice prices, however, are expected to decline after the arrival of the new harvest.Sugar is now being sold at Rs120 per kg and expected to rise further, retailers said.As private sector traders say they are out of sugar stock and both state supply utilities—the Salt Trading Corporation and the Food Management and Trading Company—have delayed opening the tender to import the sweetener, according to market insiders, the price is expected to cross Rs160 per kg by Tihar.However, retailers said the jeera (cumin seed) price has declined. But the price could still go up in the next two weeks.Last year during Dashain, the price of jeera, an indispensable spice, spiked from Rs1,400 to Rs1,500 per kg. The price has declined, and it is being transacted around Rs950 per kg this year, Adhikari said. Prices of lentils and legumes tend to fluctuate based on international production, but have remained high in recent months.According to the association, pulses have reached Rs180 per kg from Rs175 per kg.Adhikari said food prices have been increasing every year. “The rice prices are so high that people are buying only what they need in smaller quantities,” said Adhikari.“The government needs to intervene in the market, particularly inspect the large traders engaged in unscrupulous market activities,” said Prem Lal Maharjan, president of the National Consumer Forum. “Proper inspection will help bring the prices down. It will also help the government bring in more revenues,” he said.As the government has started operating fair-price shops across the country, there might be some relief for consumers, Maharjan said. “But such subsidised shops should be operated year-round to control market prices.”    \nDean Richard Thompson recently completed his two years as the American ambassador to Nepal. Arriving here just before the 2022 elections, he has since closely observed Nepali politics and society. Umesh Chauhan and Biswas Baral recently sat down with Thompson to reflect on his time in Nepal, major US projects in the country including those under the MCC, geopolitical competition with China, trade, and a range of other issues.How have you seen Nepali politics evolve in the two years you have been in the country? What events stood out? I’ve seen a lot of Nepali politics. Obviously, there’s been a lot of changes. I got here right before the national elections in November 2022. It was really great to see the democratic process play out here, to see Nepalis turn out in such great numbers and make their choices known.Democracy is such a vibrant and colourful exercise anywhere in the world. Nepal did not disappoint on that front. It's been fascinating to watch it evolve, to watch the governments come in different formations.What’s been great is the commitment we’ve seen from successive groups in government to moving forward and carrying forward the [bilateral] partnership and building on projects. I’ve also been amazed at some of the innovative things happening in various sectors of the economy.There has been some very exciting work in the IT sector, for example, that runs the gamut from more traditional back-office type operations to cutting-edge AI research, to developing educational apps for school students, to things like what we have been sponsoring at our Content Creator’s Mela these past two years. It is great to see Nepalis show lots of creativity in expressing themselves and talking about their culture and their society in so many different ways. Across the board, I’d say the experience has been unique.How have the Nepal-US relations evolved over the past 77 years of diplomatic ties? What are the salient features of the relationship? What I would say is we’ve always tried to listen, to engage with the Nepali society. Based on that, I think one of the things that we’ve done is refine the range of products.The Peace Corps, the USAID, the Millennium Challenge Corporation, the Development Finance Corporation, or other elements of our assistance and development commitments—these are different tools that can be employed. And Nepal has continually expanded its capacity to take advantage of them. The US has been able to increase the number of tools and assets, if you will, that Nepal can use to build its economy.I’m very proud of the fact that we have done this primarily through grant-based assistance, so that there is little in terms of downsides. At the same time, we have focused on different segments of the economy or society, for example, through the Development Finance Corporation, we’re now able to target and work with the financial sector to create more opportunities for small and medium-sized enterprises, particularly women-run enterprises. Through the USAID, we can use more of the traditional mechanisms of assistance.The Millennium Challenge Corporation kind of speaks for itself. It targets large-scale, massive infrastructure type projects that aim to be transformative in terms of Nepal’s economy. It has helped grow the road and infrastructure network and show new technology that can help expand that network and make roads safer, more reliable, and easier to maintain. It has helped build an electricity infrastructure that allows Nepal, first and foremost, to internally use the green hydropower that's at its disposal, but there will be excess capacity even to export it to the region to earn additional income. So I’m pretty excited about what I’ve seen happen over the past 77 years, and where we are today. I’m also extremely positive about building on where we are now. Can you give us a status of the implementation of projects under the Millennium Challenge Account Nepal? In the MCC, energy, obviously, is a high-priority area and so is transportation. Where we are with the projects themselves is we have let out the contracts for the sub-stations, for the 18-kilometre cross-border transmission line, and we have reissued the tender for the 297-kilometre broader transmission line package that had to be revised due to some cost changes over the time it took to implement that piece of the package.But we’re pretty positive about getting that back on track by the end of the year and putting the project firmly on the right footing for a five-year completion timeline. But there have also been hurdles, right? Do you still expect the transmission lines and road projects to be completed in five years?I expect there to be more hurdles. The biggest challenge was when the bids came back for the 297-kilometre transmission line. We had a number of delays there from Covid to worldwide inflation, to supply chain shifts that I don’t think people had foreseen completely. I’m not surprised. But the MCC has had a lot of experience around the world with these projects.It builds into this assumption that there will be challenges, there will be situations that need to be rethought and overcome. The real trick is making sure we move forward in a way that’s smart and focused on keeping things on time and on track. We're fortunate in the case of Nepal because we have a partner that has so heavily invested its own resources into the project.We have our $500 million grant and Nepal is putting in almost $200 million. It’s been made a national pride project. Look, other things will inevitably come up. But we believe that we have a good team that’s ready to tackle those types of challenges and press forward.At the end of the day, this can serve as a really positive model for how development assistance and how large-scale infrastructure projects can be implemented in a partnership that is largely the result of an internal domestic process. Don’t forget, Nepal requested the MCC project. The government of Nepal, through a consultative process, developed the idea, designed the project, and is now its lead implementer.We’re a financier and a partner but it is very much a Nepal-owned effort. Talking about challenges, there are many local governments and we have to deal with them every 10 to 15 kilometres in the project areas. Different communities have different concerns and priorities. This can add to some difficulty.What do you think will happen to the project if it cannot meet the five-year deadline?The fate of the project is to be completed in its entirety in five years. I can't speak to whether there’s going to be a particular challenge to delay it by six months or seven months or something like that. Right now, in our planning and projection, we hope that we can move it forward within the timeline.If it needs to go beyond that, we’ll work closely with our partner and figure it out. I’m confident that the $500 million that the US government is providing will be spent within the five years and it will lay a firm foundation for the completion of the project.But coming back to your scenario, indeed, you have different communities. A lot of people are affected by this. Now, on the one hand, that's why we encourage and insist on a consultative process, on everything being as transparent as possible so people know exactly what’s going to happen, that they know what the money is being spent on, what the effects will be in terms of how many trees will have to be cut down or what roads will be built where. That’s very important to us: no surprises for the communities that are out there.I think that we will rely on a lot of that effort to help us propel the project forward if things do get challenging on other fronts as well.Like you said, the project does need to be completed by a deadline of five years. Just in case it doesn’t, what happens?Look, it is an ambitious undertaking. There’s no question about it, right? And the Millennium Challenge Corporation is committed to making it happen within that five-year period. The MCA Nepal is committed to making it happen within that five-year period. But they’re also working closely together to make sure that it’s being done in a proper way, in a transparent way, and I’m confident that we will be able to complete what we need to complete. I’m also sure there’s a firm commitment from the government that if there’s a little piece left over here or there, to make sure it goes forward.I don’t worry about the ultimate completion of the project. I’m more focused on how we get it going as quickly as possible, because just the implementation of the project itself should employ close to 10,000 Nepalis, right? I really want communities to start to see the benefit of the project as soon as possible, because that’s where the transformative nature of it comes into play. Part of it is building it. Part of it is implementing it. Part of it is learning from that process. But then having this infrastructure in place, that’s what really changes the dynamic in Nepal and in the economic well-being of the country.Some fear that a failure to complete the project on time could even create rifts in our bilateral ties.I don’t think they should be fearful. We are partners in this, and if there’s any issue, if we're going to work through it together. What we should be doing is focusing entirely on implementing the project to its fullest potential as quickly as possible.Let’s move to geopolitics. What we see in the region is seemingly an exclusivist India-China geopolitical competition. Indians appear reluctant to work with the regimes that work closely with China. It's almost like they are saying, it's either the Chinese or us. How do you see this geopolitical dynamics playing out in Nepal? And where do the Americans fit in this picture?Yeah, it’s a good question in terms of the dynamic that’s in play today and where things are headed. We have of course been watching the India-China relationship and its development over the past few years with some degree of concern. Obviously, there was conflict there some years ago, and I think they’ve been trying to manage that since.And there’s no question that other countries in the region feel that very powerfully. From our standpoint, what we would like to see is the countries of the region—and particularly Nepal because that’s where I’m accredited and that’s where I have some level of knowledge—exercise their sovereignty and to have the space that they need to make decisions about they own future on behalf of their people in a positive way.We don’t believe countries should be asked to choose. We fully expect that Nepal is going to have good relations with India and China. They’re two neighbours. They’re large countries. They’re important countries in the region. It’s critically important for Nepal that it works with and benefits from both India and China.At the same time, we see no reason that should have any effect on our relationship with Nepal, and no reason Nepal should not be fully able to take full advantage of what the US has to offer. We will continue to watch and continue to work closely with Nepal as a partner and to encourage it to exercise its sovereignty and its decision-making in a way that benefits the Nepali people. The US-China relations are also very dicey at the moment. Surely this has some effect on how the US perceives the Chinese role around the world, including in Nepal.We had a recent high-level visit by our National Security Advisor [to China]. We’ve had recent visits by the Secretary of State, the Secretary of Commerce, the Secretary of Treasury. I think there’s a real effort to try to manage what we all acknowledge is as a competition that’s underway, in a way that’s positive and can maybe move us more towards some type of cooperative element.That channel should continue to be pursued by the US and China, but it’s not reflective of our relationship with Nepal, or our relationship with India. This is about what we can do together [with Nepal]. I’m not going to comment on what other countries may be saying about us, how they may be trying to influence us.I would commit to us remaining as transparent as possible so Nepalis can make their own decisions about what's happening by our relationship.Recently, the Americans were blamed for ousting Sheikh Hasina from Bangladesh. The US is also often accused of meddling in the domestic affairs of other South Asian states, and in other parts of the world for that matter. How do you respond to this accusation?First off, I think you’ve got to take with a grain of salt anything that’s being said by someone who’s been forced to flee their country. The United States simply does not meddle in the internal politics of other countries. We work very hard to be as transparent as we possibly can about our relationships, about what we’re doing, about what we intend.That’s not to say that if we disagree vehemently with a country about a certain policy or a certain issue, we won’t raise it. But this idea that the US would find some benefit in enacting a change in government like that, it simply isn’t part of our repertoire of diplomacy. What we rather look to do is build the strongest relationships that we can.We love to do that primarily through people-to-people relationships and sponsoring as much development opportunity as we possibly can with our partner countries. So, I put no stock in these types of rumours and statements.There is also this sentiment that the Americans and the Indians are increasingly working together on strategic issues, and the same is seen even in South Asia.Certainly, there’s been a huge growth in the strategic partnership between the US and India. I think we want to see that continue to move forward in a positive way. At the same time, there have been disagreements between the US and India on various fronts, just as we have disagreements with many of our partners. And we try to deal with those in a proactive, professional and productive way.But, again, we see our relationship with each individual country through a bilateral lens. So if there are ways that the US and India working together can be beneficial, and another country agrees to such a cooperation, fine. But when it comes to Nepal, we’re going to base our relationship and our efforts first and foremost on our bilateral discussions and our bilateral relationship.Even as we speak, the US and Nepali armies are undertaking joint training in Nepal. How would you characterise the relations between the two armies?Yeah, the PAC ANGEL exercise is going on, focused on disaster relief, humanitarian assistance. The relationship between the two militaries has been strong, it remains strong, and I think it will continue to be strong primarily because we focus it on the areas Nepal wants to focus on—which is building a Nepal army that is capable of responding to disasters, providing humanitarian assistance, and then serving as part of the global peacekeeping network through the United Nations as the largest contributor force of peacekeepers. It’s in our interest to see Nepal continue to professionalise and develop its capacity on those fronts. That’s where our focus is, and that’s where we will continue to make efforts.There has also been a lot of debate in Nepal on the Indo-Pacific Strategy (IPS) and its applicability to South Asia. What is the current state of its application?The Indo-Pacific Strategy is a broad, big strategy by the United States government about how it looks at the entire region. And so it’s about how we create an open, independent, sovereign Indo-Pacific region for the benefit of all the people in the region.What we will continue to do is employ it to build relationships we have with each of the countries in the region. How can we continue to support democratic development? How can we continue to support economic development? Let’s not forget a huge portion, maybe 60 percent of the world’s commerce transits the Indo-Pacific corridor in some way, shape, or form every year.It’s in everyone’s interest for that to remain open and free. And for the countries of the region to be able to act in a sovereign way in their own interests.There is also a sizable section of Nepalis who believe that the IPS was brought with the intent of countering China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), and that Nepal is struggling to find a balance between the two. What is your reading?The USAID, the MCC, the Development Finance Corporation, all of our development programmes have a singular purpose, which is to work with our bilateral partners to grow their economies, to make them more able to meet the needs of their people. That’s the goal. That's how they were designed. And that’s how we will continue to treat them.The BRI is China's initiative. It’s pushing that forward. It’s up to each country to decide how it wants to engage with others. We believe the model of, say, a USAID or an MCC is proving itself to be beneficial to countries, as they are grant-based and economic growth oriented. We’ll continue to push them because we think the data and historical experience we’ve had support them.I think it’s incumbent on us to try to help all of our partners relate to us as equals in any realm that we’re working together. That’s critically important and something we have to acknowledge and something we have to make sure that they’re able to acknowledge.It's about building trust, about showing that our intent is correct, that we have the best interest of our partners in mind, and that we’re applying the same and transparent standards universally.For example, on the MCC, we’ve published everything on the internet. If anybody in Nepal has a question about any aspect of the project, they can go to the website, they can read about the project, they can see the blueprints, they can know exactly what it’s going to involve. That's how I think we build relationships.I think if I came to Nepal and said, hey, I want to do X project because I want to counter this country, I don’t think I would get very good reception. We just don’t look at the world that way. It’s not a healthy approach in the long run.But a bilateral focus that seeks to empower the people of a country—that’s where I think we have the best chance of moving forward. Nepal’s Parliament has finally passed an amendment to the transitional justice law. How does the US see this development? How do you see the transitional justice process progressing?I think this is a really important step in the process. I would say that we remain positive about the way it's going and we are looking to see how we can help. You noted, I’m sure, that we joined a number of other partner countries in issuing a statement of support after the Parliament passed it.We all know bringing a conflict of this scale to conclusion is always going to be a challenge. The TJ legislation has passed, which was a tough hurdle, but implementation will also be difficult.We’re looking forward to figuring out how we can be supportive, and how other partners can be supportive. Some of that may be through bilateral means. Some of it may be through multilateral means.But what I remain encouraged about, in particular, is, we’ve always said this needs to be a Nepali-run process. It has been. That it needs to be victim-centric. I believe that it is. And so we need to make sure the consultative piece of this remains alive as you move to implementation, so that the victims groups, so that the child soldier groups, so that other entities that have been involved continue to have a voice and continue to work together to figure out how to resolve this, to make reparations work, to bring justice in those cases. And so, we are positive.Thousands of Nepali youths are leaving the country every single day in search of better jobs. In this light, do you see the prospect of greater American FDI helping Nepal build a more robust economy that can create enough good jobs?I do. At the beginning of the interview, I talked about some sectors of the economy that are quite exciting right now. I think you’re seeing a lot of interest from the US in the IT sector, the tourism sector, in the health sector, and in the energy sector as it continues to develop.We’re very keen to look for ways to bring more US investment here, whether it’s through equity sort of vehicles, or direct bilateral investments. I think that can also be positive. I think Nepal did a good job in setting up that April Investment Summit. That sent a really positive signal. You’ll recall that we had a representative from the US Chamber of Commerce, Atul Keshap, come out for that. We’ve had a great run of senior US visitors out here over the last year and a half.I think the key right now is for Nepal, through its private sector, through its government, to figure out how to make the environment for investment in Nepal as attractive as it can possibly be. In this interview, we’ve talked about the idea of competition between countries. One place where I will absolutely acknowledge there’s competition is in trying to attract investment.And so Nepal needs to figure out how to make itself as attractive as possible, and how to make it as easy as possible to do business. That helps not only investments that come from other countries, but makes it easier for Nepalis to start businesses, right? It makes it easier for Nepalis to operate and do what they want. And so, in addition to welcoming, say, US companies or British companies or Canadian companies, we would also love to see Nepalis who have gone abroad come back and start to help in building the economy here.We’ve seen how capable and how dynamic they are in building other people’s economies. Let’s do the same here at home.I mentioned that the trade and investment framework talks that we have with Nepal are in their seventh round. I look forward to, in the rest of my tenure here, to continue to build the momentum that will allow investment to take shape and the economy here to thrive. \nHere’s what Prime Minister KP Oli told the parliament on Monday, saying he was giving the address for a “special” reason: “Nepal wants to maintain neighbourly relations as a good neighbour, not a petty, scheming neighbour…Nepal wants a similar behaviour on the part of its neighbours.”He pursued this line of argument, implying that India is wishing ill on Nepal, imposing on Nepal’s sovereignty and interfering in its independent status and policy. He then told the parliament that he would present the issue at the United Nations General Assembly.It basically amounts to saying he will complain to the UN about India’s behaviour. What a petty idea.Given his inherent character trait, PM Oli will find it difficult to develop trusted relations with India in the short term. His only option is to be diplomatic, predictable and consistent. So far, he’s not been able to do that. It does not bode well for Nepal’s foreign policy, which is the most important means of pursuing Nepal’s current priorities, including jobs, growth and climate change.Calculated relations Oli’s statement in the parliament indicates at least three things. First, his expectations from India have not been fulfilled. Second, his communications with the country have broken down. And third, he thinks India may be working to undermine his political authority.Let’s look at his expectations from the southern neighbour. Oli wants to hold high-level talks with PM Modi of India and build trusted relations.In the past two weeks, media reports and opinion pieces have discussed whether Oli would be invited to India or not. It has almost become customary in Nepal for a new prime minister to visit India first before embarking on other high-level visits. Such a custom indicates the value politicians accord to India, especially if they want their government to be stable.The second indication is that Oli is finding it difficult to communicate with people who matter in India. When you begin to communicate your feelings about India through the media, it indicates that your direct communications have either broken down or are ineffective.Behind Oli’s statement is an obvious intention to play the blame game or rally the public. India may be at fault for many things, but blaming India does not absolve him of inconsistencies on his part or the sheer inability to conduct diplomacy in a dignified manner.The third indication is even more significant. Oli has consistently promoted anti-Indian nationalism, and India finds it difficult to trust him. But would that alone be enough to undermine his government?Throughout history, India has had a significant influence on Nepal’s political process and decision-making. Through its influence on individuals who’ve received gifts, benefits, and resources, some at the highest levels, India holds significant leverage over political decision-making and, by extension, over policies and processes.An old playbookIndia’s calculated relations with the Nepali state came to the fore in August this year when Foreign Minister Arzu Rana Deuba visited India. New Delhi turned her visit into a high-profile affair even though she was unprepared to represent Nepal’s interests. Her visit, rather than building political trust, ended up creating more mistrust between Oli and New Delhi as well as between the Foreign Ministry and the Prime Minister’s Office.Although it is a matter of speculation, there are strong grounds to argue that such a courtesy would not have been extended to someone from the CPN (UML). It generates the question, at least in the public’s mind, whether India accorded special treatment to FM Rana as a “special” individual who happened to be the foreign minister and not as a representative of Nepal.Whether real or not, the perception that India is unhappy with Oli has fuelled the notion that the current government coalition is unstable.Throughout Nepal’s modern history, whenever top leaders are forced out, they tend to seek India’s support to regain power. I have heard firsthand from top political leaders that India used to put a pre-condition: First, demonstrate that you have people's support, then we will use our leverage to help you. Thus, the political leaders would launch a political campaign and hold mass meetings throughout the country. If the broader political environment favoured a political change, then India made the additional push.Now, as Pushpa Kamal Dahal tours the country, blaming a corrupt network of power brokers, we are reminded of this old playbook. During mass meetings, an embittered Dahal frequently alleges that “middlemen, brokers, and big cronies have gotten together, and with the strength of so-called numbers, have tried to strangle truth, justice…and good governance.” He also tells the public that his government was ousted because the investigations on corruption were leading to Budhanilkantha (Deuba’s residence) and Balkot (Oli’s residence).Oli’s inherent anti-Indian streakFor Oli, an inherent anti-Indian streak in his psychological make-up and an affinity with the Communist Party of China makes rapprochement with India difficult.In the last 10 years, Oli has made countless petty statements intended to rile and irritate India. He has also accorded China greater space in Nepal.In his book, former deputy PM Kamal Thapa expresses distaste at the way Oli made an unscheduled visit to China Gezhouba Group Corporation and disappeared for one and a half hours for a private meeting with Chinese Communist Party officials during his visit to China in 2016.Another issue is the Eminent Persons’ Group report, which Oli raised during the launch of Thapa’s book. “It would be good to receive the report,” he said during the programme. He made more anti-Indian remarks at another similar event.At present, any talk of the EPG report is viewed as an irritant by India, because it has consistently sent a clear diplomatic message that the report is dead. The unwillingness of a section of the Nepali populace to accept the message, including the CPN-UML, has not gone well in India.In a recent discussion programme, a former ambassador of India to Nepal indicated that the EPG report had become a new irritant in Nepal-India relations. He said that instead of insisting on the acceptance of the report, Nepal could pursue the individual issues identified. Trends in the last two decades indicate that instead of really trying to address the outstanding issues in Nepal-India relations, Nepali leaders are just interested in politicising them and gaining personal mileage.Nepal’s relationship with India has become more and more of a paradox. Nepal’s dominant ethno-nationalism is anti-Indian. Indeed, Nepal has many unresolved issues with India, but it’s economic development hinges on closer connectivity with India, which in turn hinges on trusted political relationships and ability to untangle complex issues.Snubbed by India, Oli is now headed to the US, where he could still get to meet a lukewarm Modi. He hopes to gain stature and make an impression at several forums including the UNGA, where he is scheduled to deliver speeches. We can only wish our PM well. \nFive years ago, on September 30, 2019, when KP Sharma Oli was prime minister for the second time, the government declared the entire country open-defecation free amid much fanfare. However, years later, thousands of people from across the country are getting infected with diarrheal diseases, including scores from cholera.Rautahat is among the nine districts reporting cholera outbreaks this year. Ward 4 of Rajpur Municipality has reported over 100 cases of diarrheal infection and hospitalisation. However, the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division said only 12 people from the municipality had so far contracted cholera.“Over 100 diarrheal patients from the municipality’s ward 4 have been hospitalised,” Khusid Ahmad, a health worker at the municipality, told the Post over the phone from Rautahat. “Contaminated drinking water could be the culprit for the cholera outbreak there. Samples of drinking water collected from affected areas have been sent for lab tests.”Apart from Rautahat, eight other districts—Lalitpur, Kathmandu, Kailali, Pyuthan, Makawanpur, Rolpa, Sindhupalchok, and Achham—have also reported cholera outbreaks this year. So far, the number of diarrheal patients who have contracted cholera is 95. Interestingly, most of the districts that have witnessed outbreaks of deadly cholera this year had years ago been declared open defecation-free.The Vibrio cholera 01 Ogawa serotype has been confirmed in the stool samples of the infected patients. Doctors say that detected cases of cholera infection could be just the tip of the iceberg, as most positive cases are being reported from the districts with active surveillance.Public health experts say outbreaks of cholera in multiple districts, even five years after the country was declared open defecation-free, show a huge gap between official declarations and progress on the ground.They say outbreaks of diarrheal diseases, including cholera, are directly linked to drinking water, sanitation, and hygiene conditions, and the country was declared open defecation-free without improving water and sanitation conditions.“Without ensuring the quality of drinking water and sanitation, among other things, authorities rushed to declare the entire country free from open defecation,” said Dr Mingmar Gyelgen Sherpa, former director general at the Department of Health Services. “Instead of improving basic water and sanitation infrastructure, we’ve focussed too much on outbreak management, and this is the wrong approach.”Even though toilets have been built in most households, open defecation is still widespread in many places. Drinking water samples collected from various parts of the country, including from the districts of the Kathmandu Valley, have been found contaminated with faecal coliform, which means the water the public uses for drinking is unsafe. The presence of faecal coliform, a microscopic organism that thrives in the intestines of warm-blooded animals or their faeces, indicates sewage contamination in the drinking water, according to doctors.A previous study had shown that 81 percent of water samples collected in the Kathmandu Valley were contaminated with deadly microbes.“We only focussed on expanding coverage of drinking water but did not pay attention to ensuring its safety,” said Dr Meghnath Dhimal, chief researcher at the Nepal Health Research Council. “Authorities concerned must also focus on improving the quality.”Experts say improving public hygiene is essential to ensuring water quality and avoiding diarrheal ailments. Awareness drives and health education play a crucial role in changing behaviours, which requires years of investment and continuous efforts.Along with investment in health education, attention should go to building climate-resilient infrastructures for drinking water and sanitation, as water resources have been contaminated by floodwaters in many districts. The effects of climate change have increased adverse events, including floods, which in turn have contaminated the source of drinking water, making people vulnerable to infection with diarrheal ailments.“Multiple agencies of the three tiers of government and non-governmental sectors have to make more effort to prevent diarrhoea outbreaks,” said Sherpa. “But there seems to be a lack of coordination among government agencies.” The World Health Organisation also stresses on a multifaceted approach as a key to controlling cholera and reducing deaths. \n\n\nRae was the envoy to Kathmandu during the promulgation of the 2015 constitution and the subsequent blockade. In this conversation, Rae talks about the evolution of Nepal-India ties since the blockade, regional geopolitics, what the two countries get wrong about each other, how New Delhi views Nepali communist parties and the governments they lead, and the change (if any) in India’s neighbourhood policy since the start of Narendra Modi’s third term in office. \nKunwar has been the MD for just under three years. Before coming back to her homeland to join Daraz Nepal, she worked at different American companies, including Amazon, the world’s biggest e-commerce platform. In this conversation, Kunwar talks about the opportunities and challenges of running an e-commerce enterprise in Nepal, as well as the country’s overall business environment.  \nHindus throughout the country are observing the eighth and ninth days of the Bada Dasain festival today by worshipping Goddess Durga Bhawani.On eighth day, people offer special worship to the goddesses Mahakali, Mahalaxmi, and Maha Saraswati. This day of the Dasain festival is considered a special day when Goddess Durga attained power.On the occasion, people perform religious rituals at the Dasain Ghars and armories, worship the goddess at various shrines by offering animal sacrifices and read the Durga Saptashati scriptures.Devotees throng various goddess shrines in the Kathmandu Valley from early this morning to offer worship and sacrifice goats and ducks.Similarly, people throng the various goddess temples throughout the country today to offer worship, sacrificing goats, ducks, and roosters.Special Durgapuja worship and prayer ceremonies are held at the Dasain Ghars. People also worship the weapons, vehicles, and machines.People who do not sacrifice animals offer sacrifices of various vegetables and fruits in place of animals. Also on this day, a special Kalaratri worship is held at midnight at the Dashain Ghar of Hanumandhoka in the capital city. Mahanawami festival todayThe Mahanawami festival is being observed today with fervor worshipping goddess Durga Bhawani and making offerings. As per the lunar calendar, this festival is observed on the ninth day of the waxing moon in the month of Asoj. It is also marked as part of the 10-day Bada Dashain festival.Special worship is performed to Durga Bhawani today on the occasion of the Mahanawami and the 'jamara' which has been germinated is offered to the goddesses at various shrines. He-goats, ducks, roosters, and he-buffalos are sacrificed at the various temples dedicated to the goddesses. Those who do not have the tradition of offering animal or bird sacrifices, offer the sacrifice of fruits and vegetables to the goddess. The Durga Saptasati and Devi Strota scriptures are also recited at home and in temples on this day.As mentioned in the Markandeya Purana scripture, the Goddess Chamunda had slain the demon Raktabij on the day of Mahanawami. So, the special worship of the goddess on this day with the offering of animal sacrifices. On this day, the security forces also perform what is called the 'kot puja' or worship of the armories.The Taleju Temple located at Hanumandhoka in the capital is also open for the devotees to pay homage on this day. It is opened only on the occasion of the Mahanawami. The people of the Newar community also worship Bhimsen, a Hindu deity, by making animal sacrifices today on the occasion of Mahanawami.This time, the Maha Astami and the Mahanawami festivals fall on the same day. \nThe sacred Phulpati, an assortment of auspicious flowers, leaves, and plants for the Dashain festival, has been ceremoniously sent from the Kalika Temple at Gorkha Durbar to Hanuman Dhoka Durbar in Kathmandu. The Phulpati was officially dispatched on Thursday, following traditional rituals.Lok Prasad Bhattarai, a former employee of Gorkha Durbar and a priest of Dhungagadhe Bhagwati, carried the Phulpati to Kathmandu in a Ba 2 Jha 2128 vehicle. The departure from Gorkha was marked by traditional music, a decorated Phulpati palanquin, and joyous celebrations. The Phulpati from Gorkha Durbar is believed to increase the grandeur of Dashain in Kathmandu upon its arrival at Hanuman Dhoka, signaling the formal commencement of the festival.Preparations for the Phulpati dispatch began on Wednesday, the day of Shasthi. The head priest of the Kalika Temple, Sharda Prasad Bhattarai, mentioned that the process started with an invitation ritual at Piple in Gorkha Municipality-9.“The Phulpati collection process begins after a ritual offering to the gods by priests and assistants. The collected assortment includes Navapatrika, which is then sent to Kathmandu,” Bhattarai explained. He also mentioned that the Navapatrika is gathered from forest areas in Paslang, Reep, and Amarai around Gorkha. The tradition involves offering part of the Navapatrika at Gorkha Durbar, while the rest is dispatched to Hanuman Dhoka.According to local elders, the custom of offering Phulpati to both the ancestral deities of Gorkha and the newly established deities at Hanuman Dhoka was initiated by the Shah dynasty kings.It is said that Drabya Shah, the founder of the Shah dynasty, started the practice of offering Phulpati at Gorkha Durbar in 1616 BS. Later, after Prithvi Narayan Shah conquered Kathmandu, the tradition of sending Phulpati from Gorkha to Hanuman Dhoka began. “The practice of offering prayers at Hanuman Dhoka only starts after Phulpati arrives from Gorkha,” Bhattarai said. \nThe announcement by Min Bahadur Gurung, owner of the Bhatbhateni supermarket chain who was earlier jailed for misappropriating government property, to donate land and construct a building for the CPN-UML headquarters continues to stir controversy.On October 11th, Prime Minister and UML Chair KP Sharma Oli, in the presence of the party’s leaders, laid the foundation for the UML central office at Maitrinagar in ward 2 of Kirtipur Municipality. Gurung donated 10 ropani and 14 ana of land (0.55 hectares) for the UML’s party office. Not all UML leaders are satisfied with this decision, and a few have openly criticised the party chair’s decision to accept the donation. When Post talked to some party leaders about Gurung’s donation, most declined to comment openly but in private they expressed discontent. UML standing committee member Binda Pandey is one UML leader who has openly questioned the party’s decision to accept donations from the businessman. She has also argued that doing so would insult the 2.8 million voters and more than 550,000 party members.“It is wrong for a political party to accept such donations for building its party office, and it is equally wrong for a businessperson to offer such donations,” Pandey wrote on her social media. “The giving side might better know why and how they are offering such donation, but when it comes to the party, accepting such assistance, without informing discussing or deciding at the leadership level and without informing the party, could prove suicidal in the long run.”She also has urged the party leadership to reconsider the decision. However, Rajendra Gautam, the head of the party’s publicity department, said the party secretariat had decided to accept Gurung’s proposed donation of land for the party office, with Gurung himself covering construction costs.“Some of our party leaders may have been unaware of the party secretariat’s decision,” Gautam told the Post. “There is no harm in accepting a donation offered without bargaining.” The decision further aggravates public disenchantment with political parties and their leadership, say political experts, who also see a conflict of interest.They have raised concerns about how a party like the UML, currently in the government, can accept a donation from a businessman, whose case is still sub judice in court. But Gautam, the UML publicity department head, dismisses these concerns.“Until the court gives its final verdict, no one can be labelled a culprit,” Gautam said. In February last year, Gurung was sentenced to two years in prison for his involvement in the Lalita Niwas land case. He was also fined more than Rs8 million rupees. The Commission for the Investigation of Abuse of Authority also found that Gurung had made financial investments to acquire government land at Lalita Niwas, initially in someone else’s name and later in his own.A case was registered against 310 people for the embezzlement of 143 ropani of land (7.27 hectares) at Lalita Niwas. Gurung was arrested by the Central Investigation Bureau (CIB) of Nepal Police, accusing him of being the main planner of the scheme.At a public event, Oli accused the government of harboring malice toward Gurung.Gurung was released on bail from the land scam case in September of the same year. However, the CIB detained him again on charges of forging government documents, but he was again released soon. If such an incident, when political parties received donations from businessmen had occurred in any other civilised country, the party accepting the donation would have faced severe political consequences, says Keshav Dahal, a political expert.“When corruption becomes routine, political leaders cannot differentiate right from wrong,” Dahal told the Post. “The UML’s acceptance of Gurung’s donation is a form of corruption.” During the foundation stone-laying ceremony, Gurung told the media that is closely associated with the UML. Therefore, Gautam argues there was nothing wrong with accepting the donation from someone closely associated with the party.“Until and unless our party distorts the law of the land to favour Gurung’s business interests, there is no harm in accepting the donation,” Gautam reiterated.However, for political economists, a businessman donating to the ruling party in a country without specific laws raises moral concerns and presents a clear conflict of interest. To them, this incident is also indicative of the country’s unfair marketplace, where businessmen with political ties can do business on more favourable terms.“This is against the principles of a fair market economy,” political economist Bhim Bhurtel told the Post. “When the prime minister's name is linked to a businessman, that businessman will definitely receive direct or indirect benefits from state agencies, which will compel other businessmen to extend similar favours.” When one of the country’s biggest retailers has a nexus with the executive head of the state, state agencies may not be able to regulate that business, says Bhurtel.“This could also affect the price and quality of products sold by the retailer,” he added. \nChairman of the CPN (Maoist Centre) Pushpa Kamal Dahal who is also the opposition party leader, launches a broadside against the Nepali Congress, CPN-UML and former monarch all at once, stating that the formation of the government by two largest parties shows the country is heading towards a political crisis.The way the two largest political parties formed the government is a sign of political crisis, he said during an interaction with editors and reporters on Wednesday, adding that such incidents are rare in parliamentary democracy. Dahal, who was unseated by CPN-UML Chairman KP Oli in July second week, has been consistently attacking the CPN-UML.The CPN-UML withdrew support to Dahal's government in the second week of July and formed a new political alliance with the Nepali Congress which has irked Dahal ever since. The covert deal between UML's Oli and Nepali Congress chief Sher Bahadur Deuba paved the way for formation of a new government under Oli’s leadership, with Dahal relegated to opposition leader. Dahal has repeatedly blamed external and domestic forces for the fall of his government, and sometimes he claims that his anti-corruption drive was the reason behind its collapse. The Nepali Congress and CPN-UML not only decided to form a government jointly, but have also agreed to review the constitution. As per the July 1 agreement between Oli and Deuba, Oli will serve as prime minister for two years, and Deuba will succeed him.But Dahal and his party, the Maoist Centre, have taken a tough stance against revising some of the provisions of the constitution.Dahal on Wednesday squarely blamed the UML for standing against some of the key provisions of the constitution, particularly the republic.“The UML does not like the present constitution,” Dahal accused, adding, “So the UML wants to abrogate it.” This is probably the first time Dahal has made such a serious allegation against the UML. He, however, did not criticise the Nepali Congress much.“The UML also does not like inclusiveness, proportional representation and republicanism.”Dahal, during the interaction with journalists, claimed that Congress and UML are trying to abrogate the constitution. “They [Congress and UML] are hell bent on abrogating the constitution. Initially they were diplomatic, and used terms like ‘review’ and ‘revision’, but internally, they wanted to abrogate the present constitution,” said Dahal. Taking a jab at Oli, Dahal claimed that Oli’s repeated attempts to dissolve the parliament was part of a plan to undo the constitution, referring to Oli’s dissolution of the Parliament twice during his earlier term–2018 to 2022.Meanwhile, Congress and UML leaders have been claiming that they are committed to the current constitution, but believe some of the provisions should be reviewed, as they do not align with the expectations at the time of its promulgation in 2015. “They didn’t like inclusiveness, proportional representation, federalism and republic Nepal,” Dahal said, criticising the UML. However, Dahal himself has been mostly in power after 2015 with the support of either the Nepali Congress or UML. But critics say as long as Dahal was supported by the Congress and UML, he never noticed their opposition to federal, secular, republican Nepal.“We also want to review the constitution, but mainly to address the issues that have not been implemented yet,” he said, adding, “Our priority is not a review but the implementation of the constitution.”Dahal emphasised the need for laws including a federal civil service act, and provisions for setting up provincial police, among others. Time and again, various political parties and stakeholders have been raising these issues to strengthen federalism. During his interaction with journalists, Dahal also made a tall claim that major forces were trying to break up his party, the Maoist Centre. He did not name who those major forces are.The Maoist Centre has faced several splits in the past with senior leaders quitting to launch their own parties. The party is now undergoing internal struggle as senior leader Janardan Sharma has been questioning Dahal’s leadership. Dahal has been leading the party for over two decades.When asked to comment on the recent Bhutan visit of former king Gyanendra, Dahal said that there was no chance of restoration of monarchy in Nepal.The former king’s Bhutan visit reflects Nepal’s internal politics, but there is no chance of the monarchy’s return, he said. “I do not see that the king will return. I do not see that possibility. We have already moved from monarchy to republic. It is also impossible due to the actions of the former king and his family,” said Dahal.  \nThe CPN (Maoist Centre), which had earlier decided to contest elections alone, has now opted to partner with like-minded political parties other than the Nepali Congress and CPN-UML in the upcoming byelections slated for December 1.Issuing a circular on Monday, party chairman Pushpa Kamal Dahal and general secretary Dev Gurung informed the lower committees that the party has opened the door for forging electoral alliance with “progressive” and leftist parties except the Congress and the UML. On the byelections announced for December 1, the party will contest alone as far as possible and, if not, it will look to ally with “progressive” and leftist parties, the circular says.The Election Commission has already started the party registration process for the December by elections. As of Sunday, 25 political parties have registered with the commission, according to a statement issued by the commission. Previously, the Maoist Centre had decided to contest elections single-handedly. The two ruling parties Congress and UML, which are also the largest parties in Parliament, have already announced that they would not forge alliances for future elections and contest on their own strength. The Congress made this decision during the party’s Mahasamiti meeting as well as the central working committee. Likewise, a recent politburo meeting of the UML decided to contest the elections alone. The Maoist Centre circular is addressed to the party’s in-charges, district chairs and heads of provincial committees.For byelection preparations, the candidate selection for the vacant ward chair positions will be conducted through the gathering of the party’s registered ward members. The party will prioritise consensus in the selection, but if consensus cannot be reached, the candidates will be selected based on a majority vote and recommended to the municipality committee, where the final decision will be made by consensus. The Mahasamiti meeting of the Congress in February decided to contest the federal and provincial elections in 2027 single-handedly. Several top UML leaders, including party chair KP Sharma Oli and others, have also vowed to contest the elections alone. The Maoist Centre contested local, provincial, and federal elections in alliances with the UML in 2017 and the Congress in 2022. Since 2015, the Maoist Centre was continuously in power for nine years, partnering with the Congress or the UML. Maoist Centre chief Dahal was recently ousted from the prime ministership by Oli, who was appointed prime minister on July 14. The Maoist party was sidelined by the UML and the Congress after a series of political events.“We never declared our intent to contest elections alone but have opened the door for like-minded political parties to contest elections jointly,” a Maoist central committee member said. “Our maximum effort would be to contest elections single-handedly.” An office bearers meeting of the Maoist Centre, in July, concluded that the party would contest the upcoming elections on its own strength and also decided to rebuild the party and its organizations to make it enable to challenge the two largest parties. The opening of the door for alliances is also directed at joining hands with the parties under the umbrella of the Socialist Front, the Maoist leader said.“Most probably, we will forge such alliances with the parties that are associated with the front.” Besides the Maoist Centre, the front includes CPN (Unified Socialist), the Nepal Communist Party led by Netra Bikram Chand ‘Biplav’, and the Nepal Socialist Party headed by Mahindra Raya Yadav. As per the election schedule, the nomination of candidates will take place on November 17 from 10 am to 5 pm at the office of the electoral officer. A preliminary list of candidates will be published from 5 to 6 pm on the same day. Any objections or complaints against the listed candidates can be lodged on November 18, between 10 am and 3 pm. The verification and decision on the nominations and complaints will be carried out on November 18 and 19, and the final list of candidates will be published by 6 pm on November 19. Likewise, candidates can withdraw their nominations on November 20, between 9 am and 1 pm. The final list of candidates will be published from 1 to 3 pm the same day, followed by the allocation of election symbols between 3 and 5 pm. Voting will take place on December 1, from 7 am to 5 pm, at designated polling stations, according to the Election Commission. The electoral body has also announced a 48-hour silence period, starting from midnight on November 28, during which election campaigning will be prohibited. The election authority had earlier announced that there are 41 vacant positions, including two district coordination committee chiefs, two chairs, four vice-chairs, and 10 ward chairs of rural municipalities, as well as one mayor, one deputy mayor, and 21 ward chairs of municipalities. Previously, the commission conducted by-elections for the House of Representatives in Bara-2, Chitwan-2, and Tanahun-1 on April 23, 2023, and for Ilam Constituency-2 on April 27, 2024. The provincial assembly election in Bajhang (A) was also held on April 27. \nThe Nepali Congress is holding a ‘100-day campaign’ to rejuvenate party committees, strengthen the bond between the party's local representatives and central leaders, and pacify the party's dissenters.The party’s central committee meeting, which concluded on September 1, decided to run the 100-day campaign from September 23 to December 31. Krishna Prasad Paudel, chief secretary at the party office, says many central leaders have already reached the districts they are assigned to run campaign activities.According to Paudel, the party’s seven joint general secretaries lead the campaign in the seven provinces. Senior leaders Krishna Sitaula, Shashank Koirala, Bimalendra Nidhi, and Bijaya Kumar Gachhadar, along with some central committee leaders, have either reached the assigned districts or are on the way, Paudel said.“When the party’s senior leaders and central committee members are in their districts, vice presidents and general secretaries of the party will monitor the campaign activities,” Paudel told the Post. “If necessary, the vice presidents, the general secretaries, and the party president will go to some districts.”One of the main objectives of the campaign is to renew party membership. “We claim our party has 0.9 million members,” Paudel said. “During the campaign, leaders will check the trend of party members renewing their membership.”The campaign has been launched at a time when leaders have already started to devise their plans for the next general convention. As per the Congress statute, the party must hold its general convention every four years. The party’s 14th general convention was held in December 2021. If the statute is followed, the party’s next convention should be convened by the end of 2025.Some Congress leaders have floated the proposal of contesting the next general election on its own, without forging electoral alliance with other parties. General Secretary Gagan Thapa floated a proposal to this effect at the Mahasamiti meeting in February that forwarded the proposal to the central committee to take a decision on the issue.“If we are to fight elections on our own [without an alliance], we need a strong organisation, therefore the party is emphasising strengthening the party by conducting campaigns,” Paudel told the Post.But, for the party leaders, success of the campaign will largely depend on the way it will be run.“Will the party leaders try to connect the party organisation to the public or will they conduct it in just a traditional manner? This will determine the success of the campaign,” Guru Ghimire, a Congress leader, told the Post.Ghimire suggested that the party leaders should also gauge the strengths and weaknesses of other parties in the districts.Ghimire also advised the leaders not to use the campaign as an opportunity to promote factional activities.When public disenchantment towards the major parties is growing fast, the campaign the Congress has decided to carry forward could be a means to connect the leaders with the public, says a Congress leader.“This campaign will re-energise the relations between the party and the public, and the party should work hard to make this event fruitful without baggage of internal factions,” Sanjay Kumar Gautam, a Congress lawmaker, told the Post.Reconnecting with the public is a compulsion for the political parties, say political experts. Soon after the November 2022 election, major political parties including the Congress held several campaigns to reconnect with the people but the masses may not be quite impressed by the leaders’ announcements they make during the rallies unless they deliver when in power. Earlier, the CPN-UML carried out various drives such as ‘mission grassroots’, a march along Mid-Hill Highway. “Political parties’ efforts to get connected with the people is something commendable in itself,” Geja Sharma Wagle, a political analyst close to the Congress, told the Post. “But, if the political parties don’t deliver while they are in government, people might not be convinced by their pledges.”Wagle adds that as the Congress is in government, people take the leaders’ speeches seriously only if they work for them sincerely.During the 100-day campaign, the party has decided to inform the party members and local leaders regarding the seven-point agreement reached between the Congress and the CPN-UML on July 1. Based on the same agreement, the two parties formed the coalition government led by UML chair KP Sharma Oli on July 15. As per the deal, Oli will hand over the government leadership to Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba after two years.Besides their power-sharing in the federal government, the Congress and the UML have shared powers in provincial governments as well. While Koshi, Lumbini and Karnali provincial governments are led by the UML, Congress provincial lawmakers head Bagmati, Gandaki, and Sudurpaschim governments. The two big parties have backed Janamat Party to head the provincial government in Madhesh.During a meeting of the coalition partners held in Singha Durbar on September 9, Prime Minister Oli had reportedly complained that the coalition partners did not work enough to counter the ‘disinformation campaign of the opposition parties’ against the Oli government. “The opposition has spread confusion about the government, but the parties in government have not shown any interest in countering the disinformation,” the prime minister had reportedly said at the meeting. “All the ruling partners should defend the government.”Congress leaders will inform the party’s district representatives about the spirit of collaboration with the UML, constitutional amendments, and other issues. They are also responsible for informing the party members at the grassroots about policies such as the common minimum programme.Earlier this month, the Congress-UML coalition brought the programme that has, among other things, reiterated its commitment to reviewing the achievements made and weaknesses observed in the course of implementing the constitution in the past nine years. \nAfter being ousted from government for the first time in nine years, the CPN (Maoist Centre) appears to be at a turning point as it seeks to redefine its vision of socialism. In the wake of consultative meetings in seven provinces and its foreign units, party leaders have stressed the need for fresh ideas based on the party’s historic Chunwang meeting of 2005 that adopted ‘democratic republicanism’.Until this July, the party has continuously been in power since the promulgation of the constitution in 2015. Back during the insurgency days, the meeting held at Chunwang in Rukum district had endorsed the party’s political line advocating for promulgating a constitution through a constituent assembly. On this basis, the party in 2006 signed the Comprehensive Peace Accord with the then seven-party alliance and laid down arms to enter mainstream politics.The 2015 constitution envisions Nepal as a socialism-oriented country, with the Maoist Centre playing a key role in shaping that direction. But why, after all these years, is the party revisiting the question of socialism?Maoist Centre spokesman, Agni Sapkota, argues that the party has been discussing socialism in various forums. “But this time, we want a more intense and focussed discussion.” Tensions within the party also came to light during the party’s standing committee meeting in August where office bearers openly questioned the leadership of Pushpa Kamal Dahal. In response, the party decided to hold consultative meetings in all provinces to discuss the matter. Besides the provincial meetings, the party also consulted its foreign branches known as ‘pradesh committees’ in India, West Asia, and Eurasia.According to Sapkota, the Maoist Centre leadership got three mandates at the consultative meetings that concluded on September 20.“Besides the need for discussion on party ideology, the consultative meetings’ mandates include improving organisational management and updating party statute, changing leaders’ behaviour, and improving their secretariat work,” Sapkota told the Post. Likewise, another party leader, Dor Prasad Upadhyaya, says democratic socialism naturally aligns with the ideology of the Nepali Congress, whereas ‘people’s multiparty democracy’ is the ideology of the CPN-UML. “As for the Maoist Center, we lack a distinct political ideology clearly reflecting the party’s vision.”Although the party claims its ideology is ‘people’s democracy of the 21st century’, party leaders admit that its impact is diluted by lack of commitment. Party leaders said that there was no call for a leadership change during the consultative meetings. However, at the standing committee meeting in August, a deputy general secretary of the party, Janardan Sharma, submitted a 14-page document calling for a change in party leadership.Sharma and Barsha Man Pun—another deputy general secretary of the Maoist party—urged Dahal to pass over party reins to new generation leaders. According to leaders, some within the party feel that Dahal should not leave a leadership vacuum until a clear plan for leadership transition is in place.Likewise, Ram Karki, the party’s secretary, says the consultative meetings were focussed at preparing a political document that would be presented at the central committee meeting in November. “The consultative meetings were focused on the party’s diminishing influence in national politics,” Karki told the Post. “Despite our party leaders who were in government claiming that they did an excellent job, why hasn’t that reflected in the party’s life? This was a major concern expressed during the meetings.”Karki said the meeting also directed the party to remain open for cooperation with other parties with socialist inclinations. When asked about possible cooperation with the Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP), Karki dismissed the idea. “Lately, there have been some points of agreement between the two parties. But, I don’t see any prospect of the two parties getting into a working partnership,” Karki said. “The consultative meetings have said the party leadership is open to cooperation with socialist parties except the RSP.”The RSP—which was one of the junior partners in the immediate past government led by Maoist Centre chief Dahal before the government was toppled on July 12—appears to be on the same page with the Maoist Centre on many issues lately. But the two parties rule out cooperation on the political front.Party spokesperson Sapkota also says that his party can cooperate with the RSP in parliament on issues of public interest, but there is no possibility of forging a working alliance with the party. RSP chair Rabi Lamichhane, who presented his political document at the party's first national conference held for two days in Kathmandu earlier this month, also hinted at potential cooperation with like-minded parties. Despite this, RSP leaders declined cooperation with the Maoist Centre. The Maoist Centre’s consultative meetings have suggested that the party consider unification with other parties in order to revitalise the communist movement, Sapkota added.  \nTicket bookings for public transport during the Dashain festival will open this Saturday. Following discussions with stakeholders, the Department of Transport Management announced that tickets will be available online and at counters to manage the expected surge of nearly two million travellers leaving the Kathmandu Valley for the festivities.According to the department’s Director General, Rajiv Pokharel, transport operators will facilitate online bookings. “We have instructed operators to arrange online bookings wherever possible,” he said. “For counter bookings, passengers must obtain tickets only from official staff wearing uniforms and identification badges.”Around two million people are estimated to leave the Kathmandu Valley during Dashain. The department has introduced 20-point directives to ensure safe and hassle-free travel. Key measures include mandatory checks for alcohol consumption by drivers at major entry and exit points and the requirement for two drivers on long-distance routes. Additionally, those under 18 cannot work as assistant drivers.To assist travellers during Dashain, Tihar, and Chhath festivals, citizen help desks will be established at major locations such as Nagdhunga, Kalanki, Swayambhu, Halchowk, Machhapokhari, Gongabu Bus Park, Chabahil, Tilganga, Koteshwar, Jagati, Satdobato, Balkhu, Dakshinkali, Sundhara, and Sangha in Kavre. An inspection team comprising officials from various agencies will monitor travel arrangements with support from provincial transport ministries.Public transport operating on long and medium-distance routes must follow a designated queue system. Transport expert Ashish Gajurel noted that although bookings are open each year, passengers face difficulties. \"Bus operators don’t increase the number of buses during Dashain, despite rising demand. Authorities must increase the number of buses to ease travel,\" he said.Saroj Sitaula, senior vice-president of the Federation of Nepalese National Transport Entrepreneurs, however, argued that ‘unnecessary’ vehicle checks should be avoided to prevent inconvenience for passengers and drivers. He also highlighted the need to repair potholes on roads to ensure smooth travel.Earlier, Minister for Physical Infrastructure and Transport Devendra Dahal instructed the Department of Roads to complete road repairs nationwide before Ghatasthapana, the first day of the 15-day Dashain festival. The department reported that repairs are underway but have been delayed by the monsoon.The Narayanghat-Butwal road section, part of the East-West Highway, remains a major concern, with only 52.7 percent of its upgrade completed after six years of construction and multiple deadline extensions. The Meteorological Forecasting Division of the Department of Hydrology and Meteorology has predicted chances of rainfall in various places of the country for a couple of days more, raising concerns about travel difficulties during Dashain. Other problematic sections include Nagdhunga-Mugling and Mugling-Pokhara, with landslides and potholes reported along various highways, including the Mid-Hill, Madan Bhandari, Hulaki, and BP highways. \nPanic gripped locals in ward 12 of Chandragiri Municipality, Kathmandu, on Thursday morning after a suspicious object was found in the locality.The suspicious object was spotted in front of Balambu Secondary School, sparking fears of a bomb threat.Locals informed the police, and a bomb disposal team from the Nepal Army arrived at the scene. According to the NA Directorate of Public Relations and Information, the team disposed of the suspicious object, which turned out to be a pressure cooker.   \nKathmandu Metropolitan City has extended the area to prohibit building any structure on either side of the rivers in its territory.In a notice on Wednesday, the city office stated that construction of any structure has been barred on the additional 20 meters from the existing prohibited area.According to the metropolis notice, if the city has, under the existing rule, prohibited any construction on 20 meters from the area marked as river, the prohibited area will now be altogether 40 meters on either side of the waterway.The metropolis said the decision was taken based on a recent Supreme Court verdict that directed the authorities concerned to prohibit construction within an additional 20 metres from riverbanks in the Kathmandu Valley.Currently, construction is permitted only 20 metres beyond major riverbanks in the Kathmandu metropolis.The notice issued by the metropolis states, “No construction will be permitted on an additional 20 metres of land on either side of the river, and ongoing construction will be halted.”It has also asked one and all not to release contaminated water, including sewage, into Bagmati River and its tributaries. “Private and government buildings, as well as commercial properties, must install soak pits for groundwater recharge,” it said. “Waste must not be disposed of in the rivers. Non-compliance will lead to legal action under existing laws.” \nThe rhythmic beat of the Dha echoes through a Bhaktapur alley, blending with the energetic footsteps of dancers. Bhaktapur, which sees jatras and festivals round the year, is no stranger to music, dance and celebrations. But this is not an ordinary occasion. The performers in question are Lakhe dancers who are reviving the Ranjitkar Lakhe dance after a century.The young dancers are preparing for Indra Jatra this year, where mask-clad Lakhe dancers roam the streets to rid the community of hardships and suffering. Lakhe, demon deities revered as protectors of people and crops, are thought to reside in the demonic mask. As the dancer dons the mask, the spirit is said to take over.Bhaktapur was once a key site for the Ranjitkar Lakhe performances, but the art form vanished from the city after the 1934 earthquake.“Bhaktapur suffered the most damage during the 1934 earthquake,\" says Ganesh Ram Ranjit, treasurer of the Ranjitkar Group’s Bhaktapur branch. “The destruction left residents struggling to recover for a decade, making it nearly impossible to perform the costly Lakhe dance.”The Ranjitkar Group discovered the extinct dance in the year the group was established. They located a Lakhe temple in Bhaktapur that had closed after the earthquake. After two years of research, they learned that performing the Lakhe dance was seen as a good omen in Bhaktapur and involved hosting community feasts. However, the high cost of this tradition forced many to sell their properties, rendering it unfeasible in the city’s post-earthquake conditions. Over time, the dance was abandoned as more lands supporting these cultural events were lost during rapid urbanisation.“There was a significant decline in our engagement with our cultural heritage,” says Rabi Shakya, a sculptor and Lakhe dance teacher training the new dancers. “The encouraging change now is the strong interest from the new generation, which is making it possible to revive intangible heritage like this dance.”After 100 years, the Ranjitkar Lakhe Dance is making a return to Bhaktapur at this year’s Indra Jatra.“It’s challenging to accurately re-enact the dance since it hasn’t been seen in a century,” Shakya notes. “As a sculptor, I drew inspiration from Bhaktapur’s revered Shree Navadurga Bhawani to create the Lakhe’s mask.” Similarly, the dance was choreographed by studying Lakhe dances from Kathmandu, Patan, and Banepa within the Ranjitkar community, and combining them with traditional steps from Bhaktapur Lakhe dances.“As for the musical instruments, we are using traditional instruments like Dha, Dhime, and Ponga, which are said to excite the Lakhe,” says Rajendra Maharjan, Lakhe dance teacher and musician.Maharjan is one of the experienced Newari arts teachers working to revive the lost Lakhe dance. He is involved in training young students in cultural arts and is now dedicated to the Ranjitkar dance training, with the students practising together nearly every day.“Becoming a Lakhe performer involves more than just wearing the costume and mask,” said Sudin Ranjit, a Lakhe dance student. “We must train extensively with our teachers, and it demands a lot of hard work.”To Ranjit, a resident of Bhaktapur, the training is more than learning a new craft; it is a matter of protecting culture. Growing up only interested in instruments, he slowly understood how important continuing cultural practices like Lakhe dances is for their community.“The dance will not only bolster Bhaktapur’s cultural pride but also boost tourism and create jobs,” says Dr Purushottam Lochan Shrestha, a professor and researcher specialising in Bhaktapur and Newari culture.Shrestha notes that reviving the dance would offer employment to everyone involved, from the dancers and the sculptor making the masks to those participating in the rituals. “Economic centres throughout the city, from small businesses to large industries, will benefit from the influx of tourists attracted by the Lakhe dance,” Shrestha adds, commending the Ranjitkar group's initiative.Once the Ranjitkar community revitalises the Lakhe dance, the Ranjitkar group plans to set up a new Guthi house with a fresh community fund and organise annual events for the dance.“The Lakhe dance won’t let them separate,” Shakya remarks.In today’s globalised world, where identity often merges into a homogenised blend, shared cultural practices provide a sense of connection and belonging. This new Lakhe dance embodies that spirit of togetherness for the community involved.“Reviving the dance after 100 years,” Shakya says, “is about preserving our culture for the next 300 years.” \nThe Lions Club of Kathmandu Corporate, Nepal MD325-D has felicitated various personalities as part of its endeavour to recognise the contribution of the individuals and business entities for the society.As part of its campaign, the Lions Club of Kathmandu honoured Prateek Pradhan with Social Journalism Award, Sylapa T Rimponche with Social Spiritual Award, Erika Gurung with Social Player Award, Ramesh Corporation with Social Corporate House Award, Rajendra Malla with Social Corporate Leader Award and Rajesh Hamal with Social Celebrity Award.Likewise, Chandra Ghimire is honoured with Social Bureaucratic Award, Binod Das with Sports Management Award, Anil Kedia with Social Academic Award, Mohan Ojha with Social Management Award and Surya Nepal with Corporate Social Responsibility Award.The Lionism embarked in Nepal in 1971 as the Lions Club of Biratnagar under the stewardship of former Prime Minister Matrika Prasad Koirala.The Lions Clubs International says it has over 2,000 clubs operating across the nation. \nThe much-delayed Dodhara Chandani dry port and check post project in farwestern Nepal has finally moved ahead after the provincial cabinet approved the use of forest land to build the facility.The Rs15 billion project is located in Dodhara Chandani Municipality, Kanchanpur district, and is listed by the government as a national priority project.In 2023, the government approved the project's environmental impact assessment (EIA) report.On September 18, the provincial cabinet gave permission to the Nepal Intermodal Transport Development Board to use 43 hectares of Mayapuri community forest in the buffer zone of Suklaphanta National Park, clearing the last major hurdle for the project.Once completed, the dry port is expected to boost the Nepal-India trade and help drive industrial development in the western region.Dodhara Chandani dry port will be the first business gateway to India from Nepal's farwest. The site is 245 km from India’s capital, New Delhi and 1,200 km from Gujarat state. Officials said the dry port will facilitate trade with other Indian states like Rajasthan, Uttarakhand, Punjab, and Haryana. It will also provide Nepal access to India’s largest seaport, Jawaharlal Nehru Port in Mumbai, enhance Nepal's foreign trade, and reduce costs.According to Nepali officials, transporting goods to Nepal through these routes will result in substantial savings.Most of Nepal's trade infrastructure is concentrated in the east, connecting to Kolkata port. Officials say the construction of a dry port in Sudurpaschim province may open up access to more Indian ports in the future.The project is also expected to reduce transportation costs and shorten the time required to import goods from India.Dodhara Chandani inland container depot will feature administrative buildings, customs office, banks, quarantine facilities, staff quarters, warehouses, and parking spaces.As per the master plan, the depot will eventually accommodate 3,000 20-foot freight trucks, although in the first phase will provide space for 300 trucks.The import warehouse will span 7,000 square metres, and the export warehouse will cover 2,520 square metres. The railway warehouse will be spread over 17,500 square metres, and the container stacking yard, a large open space for container movement, will cover 10,000 square metres.In the project's second phase, 126 hectares will be developed for additional warehouses and parking areas.A decade and a half ago, the World Bank conducted a feasibility study for the proposed dry port at Kanjabhoj in Dodhara Chandani Municipality, and the Nepal Intermodal Transport Development Board prepared another report in 2016. \"The cabinet has granted permission to the Nepal Intermodal Transport Development Board to use the land. With this approval, groundwork will begin within the next three months,\" said Ashish Gajurel, the board's executive director. \"We will now start cutting down the trees.\"He said that the national park has written to them to find land in other areas as compensation. \"If we can’t find suitable land, we will have to provide cash compensation equal to the value of the land.\"Gajurel said that they plan to open an office after the Dashain festival to begin work. \"We will clear the site to create a working environment for the Indian side and write to them to immediately begin the tender process and other related tasks,\" he said.According to the EIA, a total of 15,057 trees need to be felled. As per the Forest Clearance Guidelines, ten compensatory trees must be planted for every tree cut for development projects. Project officials say that 150,525 compensatory trees will need to be planted.Gajurel said they need to cut down 1,700 trees immediately, which they have already marked for removal.The dry port will be built under an Indian grant.According to the project, the transshipment centre will be constructed in two phases, and the first phase is estimated to cost Rs8 billion. Dodhara Chandani dry port will be located on the border with India. A twin dry port will be built on the Indian side in Banbasa.The first phase will be linked by road, while the second phase will be linked by rail. The completion deadline is three years from the start of construction.Work has already started on a Rs3.2 billion access road on the Indian side that will connect to Dodhara Chandani. The Indian government is building the access road.Three years ago, the government had decided to constrruct the facility in ward 1 of Chandani Municipality. However, following protests by local residents in Kanjabjoj, which is in ward 8 and was originally planned site, the project was relocated. Last year, during then-Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal's visit to India, it was agreed that the facility would be built by the Indian government.A four-lane bridge over the Mahakali River has been built, and an 8-km access road on the Nepal side between Gaddachauki and Malariya river in ward 1 of Dodhara Chandani.The dry port is expected to boost Nepal-India trade and contribute to industrial development in the western region. According to Nepali officials, transporting goods to Nepal through these routes will result in substantial savings. \nNepal has imported playing cards worth Rs61.1 million in just the first two months of the current fiscal year, according to data from the Department of Customs. The demand for playing cards, particularly high during the festive seasons like Dashain and Tihar, has driven significant imports from countries such as China, India, the US, and the UK.A total of 2,007,892 decks of playing cards were brought into the country during this period, generating Rs35.2 million in revenue for the government. Playing cards are widely used for leisure activities, and also in gambling practices during Nepal’s major festivals.In comparison, Rs64.4 million worth of playing cards were imported during the same two months last fiscal year, yielding Rs40.4 million in revenue. The data also shows that China was the largest exporter of playing cards to Nepal, contributing Rs52.1 million of the total imports this year, followed by India at Rs9 million.Last fiscal year (FY 2023/24), Nepal imported playing cards worth Rs321.8 million, with China and India being the major sources, contributing Rs282.3 million and Rs 26.8 million, respectively. Smaller quantities were also imported from countries like the US and Spain.In the previous fiscal year (2022/23), playing card imports stood at Rs 212.7 million, with Rs 187.6 million worth imported from China, Rs 21.5 million from India, and Rs 3.5 million from Brazil.The rising import figures suggest a steady demand for playing cards in Nepal, particularly during the festive seasons, with millions being spent annually on their procurement from international markets. \nWhiteflies have affected more than 100 hectares of paddy fields in Palpa, in western Nepal, reducing the crop yield by two thirds.The whiteflies (Aleurocybotus indicus) have been affecting the crop since August.In many parts of Palpa, like Rampur, Nisdi, Madi, and Tinau, the district's food basket, farmers are worried about their income this year.Yubaraj Adhikari, a farmer of Rampur Municipality, said his paddy, planted on 0.5 hectares, has been severely affected. \"The plant turned red from green.\"He said the flies had attacked the paddy during the flowering stage, which means the plants still stand but will not bear kernels. A typical rice kernel is 6–10 mm long. Farmers say rice kernel will be halved even in some areas where there is some recovery.\"Based on the plant's growth, I initially expected to harvest 2 tonnes of rice. Now, it is difficult to expect even 500 kilograms.\"Farmers said hectares of rice were affected—about 70 percent potentially damaged. The government authority, however, said they are yet to do the damage assessment.Adults are tiny (about 1 to 1.5 mm) white-winged insects. The wings cover the entire body. A single whitefly can lay up to 200 eggs; if not promptly addressed, the rice will turn reddish about a week after the eggs are laid.Palpa has been witnessing a series of pest attacks, which experts say may be due to the change in the climate pattern.According to the National Climate Change Survey 2022, released by the National Statistics Office, formerly the Central Bureau of Statistics, in May, over the past 25 years, approximately 50 percent of households surveyed reported the emergence of new diseases in their crops.Similarly, 53.9 percent observed the presence of new insects or pests affecting their crops, and 29.8 percent of households noted the appearance of new diseases in their livestock.Agriculture is the mainstay of Nepal's economy. It contributes 24.6 percent to the country's GDP and employs over half of its population.In Palpa, three years ago, an insect known as hopper—plant feeders that suck plant sap from grass, shrubs or trees—infected a large swathe of farmland in Madi, Rampur, Argali and Kachal.Shanti Dotel of Rampur municipality has no hopes of making income from the paddy this year.“The whiteflies have attacked the paddy field. It has turned red,\" she said.Madi and Tinau are the most affected areas.Yam Bahadur Chidi, chairman of Mathagadi rural municipality, said they had received complaints from farmers about the crop damage. \"The pest attacked the crop during the flowering period, which will significantly affect the output.\"\"The yield will drop,\" said Mani Ram Adhikari, another farmer of Rampur Municipality-6. Farmers said that among several varieties, the high-yielding Sabitri is mainly affected by whiteflies.Rampur has been affected by the whiteflies for the last three years, and the flies are gradually invading other areas. The municipality said that whiteflies have been reported since August, mainly in four wards—4, 5, 6 and 7.The municipality even launched a pesticide spray programme, but to no avail. Shanti Dotel, a farmer of Rampur municipality-6, said she chose to plant an improved variety of paddy to get a larger yield, but the situation changed. \"It looks like the straw will also not work.\"She said the pest attack was mostly seen on the hybrid varieties and nominally affected the local varieties.\"It has mostly affected the variety Sabitri,\" said Narayan Prasad Gaire, chief of the agriculture section of Rampur Municipality. “We have even distributed pesticides to the farmers. In some places, we have observed some regeneration in plants.\"Palpa has 8,210 hectares of paddy fields, and hybrid types have been proliferating. \n\nWith the federal government slashing the budget of the nutrition programme, the distribution of fortified flour has been halted in all five districts of Karnali Province since the start of the ongoing fiscal year.Officials admit that the progress in improving nutrition in Karnali Province, achieved through years of efforts and investment, may have been jeopardised due to the suspension of the programme.“Thousands of pregnant women, new mothers, and young children have been deprived of fortified flour, which was crucial in reducing severe malnutrition among these,” said Lila Bikram Thapa, chief of the Nutrition Section at the Family Welfare Division under the Department of Health Services. “The provincial government has started providing Rs2,500 to new mothers, but there is no support for improving the nutrition of young children.”Malnutrition is a silent crisis in Nepal. The country has made significant progress in reducing stunting among children under five. Stunting decreased from 57 percent in 2001 to 25 percent in 2022, according to a report of the Nepal Demographic and Health Survey-2022.Likewise, wasting declined to eight percent from 10 percent in 2016. Wasting or low weight for a particular height is an undernutrition condition, which is a strong predictor of mortality among children under five, according to the World Health Organisation. Wasting in children is associated with a higher risk of death if not treated properly, according to it.Even though the survey report showed some improvement in the country’s overall nutrition status, progress is not the same in all provinces. The problem is more prevalent in the Karnali Province. According to the report, over 30 percent of children under five in the province are stunted, the highest in the country, which is an indicator of chronic undernutrition. The province is also the poorest and most food insecure compared to the national average.According to officials, as part of a super flour distribution programme launched in 2014, the government used to provide three kg of flour—fortified with all necessary micronutrients—to pregnant women, new mothers, and children aged six to 24 months every month to address chronic malnutrition problems in the province. For that, the Health Ministry used to allocate Rs 50 million. “This year, around Rs100 million has been cut from the nutrition programme budget and this is the main reason for the stoppage of the fortified flour distribution programme ” said Thapa. “Besides halting the flour distribution, the budget cut will also impact awareness programmes, which are crucial for reducing the burden of problems.”Nutrition experts warn that slashing Karnali Province's nutrition budget will have long-term consequences and could jeopardise the decades of progress in the sector.They say that authorities concerned should have promoted locally available foods, made people aware of the importance of nutritious foods and provided fortified flour to improve nutrition conditions and lessen dependency on freely distributed foods.They say that health authorities must continue awareness programmes to educate people about the importance of healthy food and what they have been providing.Doctors say malnutrition during pregnancy increases the risk of complications and maternal and neonatal deaths, as well as the likelihood of low birth weight. It is a major impediment to growth, affecting human capital and economic productivity.Experts say that nutrition has a direct link with the overall development of the country.They add that malnutrition affects children's physical and mental growth, ultimately affecting the country’s economic health.The Health Ministry had sought help from the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) to address the growing problems of malnutrition in Lumbini, Karnali, and Sudurpaschim provinces in the past.According to Thapa, the federal government has not renewed its contract with the World Food Programme, which provided logistic support for the fortified flour distribution programme.“This year, the government neither has renewed its agreement with the WFP (World Food Programme) nor allocated a budget for continuing the fortified flour distribution programme,” said Thapa.  \nSave the Children Nepal has launched a pilot initiative of introducing ‘rainbow kits’ specifically designed for transgender individuals impacted by disasters.The initiative aims to ensure that transgender people have dignified access to essential hygiene materials during times of humanitarian crisis.The rainbow kits break traditional gender binary norms by addressing the specific needs of the transgender community during humanitarian disasters, such as the recent flood and landslides in Nepal.“The rainbow kits are a response to the limitations of conventional humanitarian dignity and hygiene kits, which often fail to meet the needs of the LGBTQI+ population,” said Tara Chettry, country director for Save the Children in Nepal and Bhutan. “As diversity and inclusivity remain at the heart of Save the Children’s organisational values, I believe this initiative broadens our approach to humanitarian response, encouraging us to view aid through a more targeted and inclusive lens rather than a one-size-fits-all solution.”The kits were officially handed over to the Blue Diamond Society (BDS), a pioneering organisation working for the rights of LGBTQI+ individuals in Nepal. The BDS will distribute these essential kits to those affected by recent floods and landslides, ensuring that the specific hygiene needs of the LGBTQI+ community are met.The rainbow kit includes a carefully curated selection of items designed by Save the Children and the BDS to support health, dignity, and comfort, including condoms and lubricants, sanitary pads/menstrual cups/tampons, wipes, dry tissues, V-wash, panty liners, hot water bags, menstrual panty (free size), towel, hand sanitiser, toothpaste and brush, soap, masks, and other essential items.Tailored kits promote inclusivity and ensure that all identities are recognised and respected, regardless of their sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression and sex characteristics, said Manisha Dhakal, executive director of Blue Diamond Society. \nAmid the risk of a sharp rise in dengue cases in the coming days, the Ministry of Health and Population is gearing up to purchase rapid diagnostic test kits.Officials admit that they have only around 2,000 kits in stock, which is insufficient to carry out daily testing if cases spike.“We have decided to purchase rapid diagnostic test kits worth Rs 1 million immediately for dengue testing,” said Dr Bikash Devkota, director general at the Department of Health Services. “We have also asked health agencies under provincial governments to purchase rapid diagnostic test kits on their own.”Officials admit that the risk of an exponential rise in dengue cases has increased as the post-monsoon season, which is considered the peak dengue season, has just started, and the rainfall has not stopped. The recent disasters, which killed hundreds and displaced thousands, have also increased the risk of a surge in infections, experts say.At least 246 people have been confirmed dead, while 19 others are still missing following floods and landslides triggered by record-breaking rainfall some 10 days ago. As many as 173 people have been injured, and more than 17,120 others were shifted to safety, according to Nepal Police. “The risk of dengue infection has increased, as hundreds of displaced people are now living in temporary shelters, where water, sanitation and hygiene conditions have been compromised,” said Devkota. “Stored drinking water in these shelters could turn into breeding grounds for mosquitoes, the dengue vectors. We have alerted our health officials accordingly and asked them to launch an awareness drive in the high-risk areas.”Dengue is a mosquito-borne disease transmitted by female Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes. The same vector also transmits chikungunya, yellow fever, and Zika viruses, according to the World Health Organisation.At least seven deaths and 14,975 infections have been reported from 76 of 77 districts across the country since the start of monsoon this year. Experts say reported dengue cases could be just the tip of the iceberg, as around 90 percent of the infected people do not show any symptoms.Health officials say that they have communicated to provincial health authorities to prepare for a possible surge in dengue cases in the coming days. But provincial health authorities have instead asked the federal government agency to purchase testing kits and supply them to the provinces.“Some provincial health authorities have asked us to purchase dengue testing kits and supply them,” said Dr Yadu Chandra Ghimire, director of the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division. “But it is not possible for the federal government to purchase testing kits, which are required in huge quantities, due to budget constraints.” Since there is no specific treatment for dengue, health workers provide symptomatic care and diagnose patients based on symptoms.Of late, a surge in dengue cases has caused a critical shortage of blood in the Kathmandu Valley. The Central Blood Transfusion Service (blood bank) said that hospitals in the Valley have been facing a surge in demand for platelet-rich plasma and platelet concentrate due to the surge in dengue cases.“The daily demand for blood and blood components is about 400 pints, but we have only been able to collect about 100 pints,” said Sanjeev Kumar Yadav, senior technical officer at the Central Blood Transfusion Service. “We urge everyone eligible to step forward and donate blood. We have been struggling to meet the demand, and families of critically ill patients are in a difficult situation as they can’t find blood.”Officials attributed last week’s monsoon disaster and the start of the Dashain holidays to the decline in blood collection. They say the closure of colleges for the Dashain holidays, along with many offices and organisations suspending blood donation campaigns due to the festival, has led to a sharp drop in donations.According to doctors, mild to high fever, severe muscle pain, rashes, severe headache, and pain in the eyes are some symptoms of dengue.The World Health Organisation (WHO) says there is no specific treatment for severe dengue, but early detection and access to proper medical care can save lives.Dengue is a mosquito-borne viral disease transmitted by female Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes. The same vector also transmits chikungunya, yellow fever, and Zika, according to the WHO. \nRam Prasad Koirala, a resident of Nalagaun in Belkotgadhi Municipality, Nuwakot, spent all of Thursday racing around Kathmandu and Bhaktapur, desperately searching for platelets for his 13-year-old son, who has been infected with dengue.Doctors at the Maharajgunj-based Tribhuvan University Teaching Hospital, where his son is being treated, told Koirala to get platelets as his son’s platelet count had dropped to a dangerously low count of 13,000 per microlitre of blood. A healthy count ranges from 150,000 to 450,000 platelets a microlitre.“The doctors have asked me to arrange six pints of platelets, but I could manage only one pint,” a frustrated Koirala told the Post. “I spent the whole day visiting several blood banks across Kathmandu and Bhaktapur, but still couldn’t find donors.”This was a common refrain among many relatives of seriously ailing dengue patients who had come to the Central Blood Transfusion Service (blood bank) in search of platelets, as hospitals in the Valley have been reporting a surge in dengue cases.Officials at the central blood bank said that the demand for platelet-rich plasma and platelet concentrate has tripled compared to the usual daily collection.“Demand for blood and blood components is about 400 pints a day, but we have been able to collect only around 100 pints,” said Sanjeev Kumar Yadav, senior technical officer at the Central Blood Transfusion Service. “We urge everyone eligible to step forward and donate blood. We have been struggling to meet the demand, and families of critically ill patients are in a difficult situation as they can’t find blood.”Officials attributed last week’s monsoon disaster and the start of the Dashain holidays to the decline in blood collection. They say the closure of colleges for the Dashain holidays, along with many offices and organisations suspending blood donation campaigns due to the festival, has led to a sharp drop in donations.“We are ready to travel to Nuwakot, Dhading and other adjoining districts of the Valley to collect blood, as we have no other option for saving lives,” said Yadav. “Relatives of patients, especially those with dengue, have been waiting at the blood bank round the clock.”Officials at the blood bank are worried about a severe blood shortage, as colleges will not reopen until after the Chhath festival (first week of November), and many people will soon be leaving the Valley. They said there is already a daily demand for over 100 pints of platelet-rich plasma and platelet concentrate for dengue patients. As a single patient requires multiple pints, they lament that it is impossible to meet the demand at the current collection rate.“We have also sought help from mainstream as well as social media for blood donations,” said Yadav.Dengue is a mosquito-borne disease transmitted by female Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes. The same vector also transmits chikungunya, yellow fever, and Zika viruses, according to the World Health Organisation.At least seven deaths and 14,975 infections have been reported from 76 of 77 districts across the country. Experts say reported dengue cases could be just the tip of the iceberg, as around 90 percent of the infected people do not show any symptoms.The post-monsoon period is considered a high transmission season for dengue, but Nepal has witnessed outbreaks of the deadly disease since the beginning of the year and across the pre-monsoon, monsoon, and post-monsoon seasons.According to doctors, mild to high fever, severe muscle pain, rashes, severe headache, and pain in the eyes are some symptoms of dengue.The World Health Organisation says there is no specific treatment for severe dengue, but early detection and access to proper medical care can save lives. \nConcerns are growing about a possible rise in home deliveries in several districts after road links were disrupted last week’s devastating floods and landslides.Officials at the Ministry of Health and Population said that they are aware of the growing risk and have instructed agencies concerned to start risk mapping.“The risk of home deliveries has grown due to last week’s monsoon havoc,” said Dr Bikash Devkota, director general at the Department of Health Services. “We have instructed agencies concerned to monitor the situation and report back. We also held discussions with our development partners about the risks and requested them for help.”At least 233 people have been confirmed dead, while 22 others are still missing in the floods and landslides triggered by record-breaking precipitation in three days starting Thursday evening last week. As many as 169 people have been injured, and more than 17,120 others were shifted to safety, according to Nepal Police. Transport links to many districts have been disrupted by the floods and landslides that swept the roads and bridges in many places. Health facilities and birthing centres in many places were also destroyed in the disaster.Maternal health experts say that the recent disaster could cause a severe setback to maternal and child health and also affect institutional delivery rate.“Due to the disruption in vehicular movements, many pregnant women may not be able to reach birthing centres,” said Nisha Joshi, a public health official at the Family Welfare Division under the Department of Health Services. “Pregnant women and new mothers who have lost family members or property in the disasters would be unable to reach hospitals or health facilities for childbirth.”Health officials say that they have cautioned health workers in the affected areas about the heightened risk of an increase in home deliveries, which increases the risk of maternal and newborn deaths.A report on maternal mortality carried out by the National Statistics Office in 2021 showed that for every 100,000 live births, 151 women still died from maternity-related complications. Similarly, the institutional delivery rate has reached around 80 percent. Maternal death rate and home delivery rate are very high in remote areas. “We are aware of the risk of a rise in home deliveries, which poses a threat to the health of mothers and their newborn,” said Joshi. “We have requested the United Nations Population Fund and Nepal Red Cross Society to distribute warm clothes to 12 new mothers in the Nakkhu area of Lalitpur, who are taking refuge in makeshift shelters.”Maternal health experts say expecting mothers may face difficulties in attending regular checkups during pregnancy, which could put both their lives and babies at risk. Along with a potential drop in institutional deliveries, the number of antenatal and postnatal visits could also decline due to the impact of the disaster, according to them.With the government announcing free institutional delivery service in 2009 at all state-run health facilities, more than 2,800 birthing centres were set up across the country. The institutional delivery rate, which was around 18 percent then, has now increased to an average of around 80 percent across the country. The health ministry also provides travel allowances for antenatal care visits, offers skilled birth attendant (SBA) training to staff nurses, and hires them at birthing centres to help prevent deaths during or after childbirth.Nepal had cut the maternal mortality rate from 539 per 100,000 births in 1996 to 239 per 100,000 births in 2016—for which the country even received a Millennium Development Goals award.In the last fiscal year, at least 190 women from 51 districts died of complications during childbirth, data provided by the health ministry shows.The actual number of maternal deaths due to birth-related complications could be much higher, as maternal and perinatal death surveillance is being carried out in 51 districts only, officials say.Nepal’s target under the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals is to reduce the maternal mortality rate to 75 per 100,000 births by 2030. \nDusit Princess Kathmandu hosts a five-day trout festival from 12:30 pm to 10:00 pm till August 30, showcasing 12 unique trout dishes featuring flavors from around the world.\nInspired by baking shows, a young baker overcomes mishaps and masters techniques through scientific analysis, emphasizing the importance of precision, patience, and embracing the journey.\nAfter the Stonewall Riots in 1969, queer individuals who faced discrimination and violence found refuge at the Inclusive Galaxy Restaurant in Kathmandu, where they can now express themselves freely, connect with their community, and support each other.\nAditya Mishra, a Nepali chef in New York City, promotes Nepali cuisine through his supper club \"The Sewing Tin\" and incorporates traditional dishes like kachaila into his menu, while also facing criticism for blending Nepali food with modern styles and highlighting the challenges faced by restaurant owners in Nepal.\nCeleus Baral, an environmental science student, launched Bakeleus, an online baking shop featuring jams, tarts, cakes, cookies, and brownies, utilizing produce she grows and experimenting with creativity and zero-waste practices.\nKhokana, a historic village near Kathmandu, preserves ancient architecture, mustard oil mills, and traditional rituals like the Sikali Jatra, providing a glimpse into the Valley's past amidst urban expansion.\n“How much oxygen do you have for the summit?”I think this is the kind of question a film producer would ask. But when you're on the mountain, the answer is never clear.I have worked for a long time in the film industry and different art areas, especially photography and engraving.Working in various fields and drawing inspiration from them has become a new normal for me. I have made this approach my way of life without even realising it.I took responsibility for producing the last movie I worked on and shot the behind-the-scenes footage for a documentary. By doing so, I witnessed the entire shooting process and the journey of a movie.In the snowy highlands of Turkey, we had to endure the consequences of the changing climate to shoot ‘About Dry Grasses’, directed by Nuri Bilge Ceylan. The highlands used to be snowy in January, but by the time we got there in the same month, there was no snow. Nature was changing. It was responding to what was happening—to what humanity had done to it. In the end, it snowed, and we shot the intense snow scenes we wanted. But since most of our days were sunny, unlike what the director wanted, we had to shoot in the sunset and sunrise hours. As crew members, we spent many days waiting for the sun to set.Production requires creating opportunities, finding solutions, and being creative for a work of art to come true. For this, patience, endurance, calmness, and timing are necessary. On the other hand, nature wanted us to listen to it and wait for the right time.During that time, I witnessed many of nature's lessons. For example, I experienced extreme cold for the first time. We endured temperatures ranging from -33 degrees to +55 degrees. By listening to nature, surrendering to its forces, and working within its limits, we managed to persevere.No matter how much you prepare or plan during the pre-production phase, if you are working in nature, remember that nature will always have the final say.The film was completed, released, and connected with audiences. Its success at Cannes 2023 was followed by my trip to the North Pole for my project. I returned with a mix of wonderful developments, joys, and challenges. During this process, I experienced life and death, happiness and sadness, losses and awards.I realised the value of being able to breathe comfortably a few days after my father's chemotherapy ended. Just a few days earlier, he had said, \"Well done, my daughter. I'm glad you went!\" All the anxiety and hard work, filled with fears at the beginning, were finally behind me.Before going to Everest, when I was on the verge of giving up, defeated by my fears, I remembered my father's words. Everest reminded me of what he said while struggling to breathe, adding a turning point to my life.What does it mean to say ‘life’s turning point?’ How many turning points can there be in life?Who am I, and what am I doing in this world? How well do I know my own limits? Can I find answers to these big questions? These thoughts sparked my dream of journeying to Everest. Now, after returning, I can say that it turned my life around.“How much oxygen do you need for the summit?” sounds more like “How much do you need to hold on to life?” How many reasons do you find that give meaning to your life, keep you alive, and allow you to breathe? How much can you endure in the face of obstacles, and can you keep believing that a solution will eventually come your way?Can these questions be separated from the idea of measuring and assessing something, from learning its quantity and financial value? Can everything be known with certainty? Should the journey be fully understood in advance, with all its promises laid out? Should it be viewed like a purchase with a price tag, asking, “Is this journey worth this much?”I had never trekked before and had no climbing experience. I had lived at sea level my entire life and had never been to a high altitude.However, this journey was not only about the physical climb but also an inner discovery. After losing my father to lung cancer, his breathing difficulties taught me the fragility of breath, life, and existence. I also mentally prepared myself for the physical challenges I might face. Despite all my concerns, could this journey help me understand the cycle of life and the resilience of the soul?So, how could I make this trek possible? How could I land in Nepal? Despite all the economic difficulties and the many things I felt needed organising, I did my best and believed in it.Since I was embarking on this journey, I felt I should share about my travels and inspire others.Starting with photography, cinema, and engraving, which are already integral parts of my life, I dreamed of documenting and sharing the inspiring aspects of this journey.After months of correspondence and dreaming, it all came true. Finally, I embarked on the journey with the goal of creating photographs, engravings, and documentaries. I learned a great deal from my travels in Nepal, from the people I met, and from every moments I witnessed. I felt incredibly fortunate to have been able to honour my father’s memory with the peace and serenity I experienced in the Himalayas.During my 15-day journey to Everest Base Camp, I encountered nature’s masterpieces at every turn. As concerns like “How will I endure?” and “How will I finish?” started to weigh on me, the mountains suddenly parted with the clouds and gazed down at me.It was amazing to witness the appearance of ‘Gods’ that I had never seen before, in such immense size and in such a close, awe-inspiring manner beside me during that silent walk.As someone who came from one of the most crowded cities in the world, Istanbul, while I struggled with my daily questions and uncertainties, trying to control everything, they stood there calmly, as if answering me.They were just there—before and after.My guide, Lakhpa Sherpa, always reminded me not to worry about how high we were, how long it would take to reach our accommodation, or what the weather would be like. He encouraged me to live in the moment, and he was right.He advised me to focus on my breathing, not to get thirsty, to eat enough, and to appreciate the extraordinary beauty of the journey. In the mountains, plans dissolve and each moment is embraced as it comes.All the good wishes, prayers, and everything encountered along the way were for the journey itself. The mountain was full of life, secrets, and everything I had wondered about.This 15-day journey to Everest Base Camp was a solo adventure, yet I wouldn't have been able to complete it without my guide, Lhakpa, and my porter. Additionally, I was fortunate enough to experience the hospitality, generosity, and honesty at Trekkers Paradise, which organised the entire journey and provided guidance.I witnessed how dedication and sincerity are crucial in completing a journey safely and healthily. Ghanshyam Sharma, from Trekkers Paradise and Sauraj Jhingan, a climber who summited the Everest in 2018, shared their experiences with me during the journey.They experienced the 2015 earthquake while they were at the Everest Base Camp.As a filmmaker, their role as actors, and attention to detail played a significant role in bringing my dream photography and documentary project to life.The sponsors of my journey were Turkish Airlines, The North Face, Apple, Canon, and Stanley. My supporters include Oscar International College and Nepal Film Campus. Throughout the journey, I shared many experiences, memories, and countless photos and images with my students.On my way back home after 21 days, I celebrated my birthday on the plane. From the right window, the Himalayas bid me farewell. I felt like I had opened a new chapter in my life, and I was certain that I would return.I had made many friends and memories in Nepal.For now, I will be working on a documentary and preparing for a photography and engraving exhibition titled ‘My Soul Beyond the Mountain’.To the Himalayas: This summer was spent with you, but we will meet again soon. \nWe spent five days in Sri Lanka two weeks ago, driving up and down the island, covering almost 70 percent of its territory. Our tour spanned over 1,000 kilometres, including hills, beach spots, and heritage and religious sites.Our first stop in Sri Lanka was Colombo’s Bandaranaike International Airport. We were greeted by a warm and humid breeze when we exited the airport. The host briefed us (a group of journalists) that heavy rainfall has affected areas across Sri Lanka since mid-May 2024. Rain and storms intensified on June 1, with the most significant effects in the south and west of the country. We were lucky to have no rain in the forecast.On the first night, we checked into the lavish Jetwing Lake resort, an opulent sanctuary amidst the lush landscape. The resort’s expansive grounds were a retreat, offering a glimpse of Sri Lanka's natural beauty. We feasted on delicious cuisine, every bite exploding with flavour, introducing us to the island’s famed culinary delights. On June 7, early morning, the sun shone brightly, previewing the promise of an incredible journey ahead. We set off early the following day, eager to explore the mysteries of this enchanting island. As we ventured further into the heart of Sri Lanka, the landscape revealed its majestic nature. We were astounded by seeing Pidurangala Rock, a 200-metre-high granite colossus just a kilometre north of Sigiriya. The short hike to Pidurangala Rock offered breathtaking views of Sigiriya and beyond. We climbed the steep steps and soon were rewarded with a breathtaking panoramic view of the surrounding landscape. It took us 30 minutes to climb. The sight took our breaths away and left us humbled in the presence of such grandeur. From the top are glorious vistas of the surrounding landscape and an incredible view of the majestic Sigiriya Rock. From there, Sigiriya Lion’s Rock is visible, standing alone. This was the place where demon king Ravana had his palace in the Treta Yuga. Believed to have been built 50 centuries ago, the palace is said to have had a unique lift for Ravana and his visitors. Ravana imprisoned Sita in one of the caves at the bottom of this humongous boulder. Sigiriya is a fifth-century fortress in Sri Lanka carved out of an inselberg, a hill of hard volcanic rock that soared high above the surrounding jungle. We spent two hours atop the rock, mainly taking photographs. We descended from Pidurangala Rock, filled with awe and a sense of accomplishment.The journey ahead seemed even more enticing as we ventured along the winding roads, heading towards our next destination.Cash-strapped Sri Lanka plunged into its worst financial crisis in more than seven decades in 2022, with a severe dollar shortage sending inflation soaring to a high of 70 percent, its currency to record lows, and its economy contracting 7.3 percent.Thanks to the growing number of tourists, Sri Lanka is now bouncing back.In Jetwing Lake, we met Kasun Pradeep Somasiri, a receptionist. He briefed us that the resort is now 50 percent occupied. “That’s a better figure now as we are recovering.”The travel and tourism sector is a significant income generator for Sri Lanka. However, the economic crisis, the Ukraine–Russia war, and China’s zero-Covid policy have jeopardised the industry.Tourism accounted for more than 12 percent of the country’s GDP in 2019 and was the third-largest source of foreign exchange reserves, behind worker remittances and the apparel industry.Sri Lanka was poised to be one of the world’s best holiday destinations due to its rich culture, wealth of natural resources, and diversity of accessible experiences.However, tourism-dependent Sri Lanka suffered its first major setback with the Easter bombings 2019. This led to the collapse of inbound tourism flows as international arrivals declined by 18 percent year-on-year, and tourist expenditure fell by 17.7 percent that year. This was immediately followed by two years of pandemic restrictions. Inbound visitors fell to just 116,600 in 2021.An acute balance of payments crisis forced Sri Lanka to preemptively default on foreign debt of over $50 billion in April 2022, triggering a crippling economic contraction with spiralling inflation.“Tourism is gaining momentum,” says Somasiri. “The British and Chinese have started to return to Sri Lanka.”January-August is the peak season for foreigners. “From December to April, local people travel for holiday purposes,” says Somasiri. Before we started the tour to other religious sites, our tour guide, Sampath Mayadunne, told us, “Don't take selfies with your back to Buddha.” Turning your back on a Buddha statue and some other religious sites to take photos and videos is a strict no-no.The most common sight across Sri Lanka is the tank cascades system, an ancient irrigation infrastructure. The system is a network of small tanks draining to large reservoirs that store rainwater and surface runoff for later use.“These infrastructures were built by its ancient kings over 2,000 years ago to solve the water scarcity in the country’s dry zone,” says Mayadunne.On day two, we travelled to Ranweli Spice Garden in Matale. This garden is famous for its rare spices and herbs. A tour of the gardens will show you the cultivation, harvesting, cleaning, and packaging process, as well as the health benefits and uses of the herbs.On the way, we saw a colourful Muthumariamman Hindu temple, boasting hundreds of detailed sculptures in a rich mosaic of colour.In Kandy, we visited the Temple of the Tooth Relic (Sri Dalada Maligawa), one of the most sacred places of worship in the Buddhist world. It was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1988.The temple sustained damage from bombings by Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna in 1989 and by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam in 1998. However, it was fully restored each time.We then headed to Jetwing St Andrew’s, a luxurious 5-star property in Sri Lanka’s hill country of Nuwara Eliya, situated at 1,900 metres above sea level. During our stay in Kandy, we immersed ourselves in the city's charm and the serenity of the countryside. On the third day, early morning, we travelled to Nuwara Eliya, the area famous for tea estates that give many Nepalis the feeling that they have come to Kanyam, Ilam, in eastern Nepal.We visited a tea factory called Damro Labookellie Tea Centre, the oldest tea centre in Sri Lanka. Due to its cold climate, it is the most important area for tea production in Sri Lanka.In this tea factory, they make white and black tea, while the green tea is processed in another tea factory and then sent to Damro.After the tea factory tour and the tea tasting, we headed to Galle, our next resting point.We encountered narrow, winding, and maze-like streets and alleys in Nuwara Eliya, known as ‘Little England’. The town has preserved almost all its British-era buildings and is calm and beautiful. On our way to Galle, at the roadside, our tour guide stopped us at the famed Sita temple, which has Hanuman's footprints and is the place where Sita, wife of Lord Rama, was held captive by the demon king Ravana after he abducted her from India.We were at Sita Eliya, a temple named Sri Seethai Amman.When we reached the Hindu temple, rich in vibrant colours and architectural elements, it was full of devotees. The water stream adjoining the temple is believed to be where Sita bathed. Large footprints are found on the stones in the stream, and there is a saying that those belong to Hanuman, who came spying to find Sita’s whereabouts.In Ella, Ravana’s waterfalls are significant in the Rama-Ravana story. The cascade charms visitors from all over the globe. The waterfall is easily accessible and is known to have hidden caves at the top, which are believed to have been used as Ravana's residence.The 25-metre-tall waterfall is a beautiful cascade that provides the perfect backdrop for a photo to remember your Ramayana trail adventures in Sri Lanka. A short pilgrimage tour ended there, and it was now time for an adventure. Though it was not part of our itinerary, our guide decided to tour us on a train ride.Though short, only six kilometres from Ella to Demodera, it was thrilling. Everyone screamed in unison like kids on a fair ride to hear the echoes in the dark every time we passed through the tunnels. The sound of the train is subtly different inside a tunnel. For the first-timer, the darkness and shouts inside the tunnels when the train passes would be scary, like a horror movie.The train we boarded wasn’t crowded, but people had already filled the doorway, ready for the scenic journey.With the shrill sound of a whistle, the train slowly pulled away from the platform at Ella, passing houses, coconut trees and green fields.As the train progressed, tourists and locals were leaning out the windows and crowding to hang out the doors. I joined the crowd and hung out on a train. A short excitement ended there.After lunch, we headed to Galle and reached Jetwing Lighthouse. As soon as our group entered the hotel, they shouted with excitement.The hotel is on a rocky outcrop three miles west of Galle. Waves crash over giant boulders in front of it and produce howling winds.We were at Galle’s 17th-century fort five minutes from the hotel on day four. In the Bay of Galle on the southwest coast of Sri Lanka, Galle Fort was built first in 1588 by the Portuguese and lavishly rebuilt by the Dutch during the 17th century. It is a historical, archaeological and architectural heritage monument that maintains a perfect appearance even after more than 436 years.We then reached Hikkaduwa Beach, a popular beach destination on the southern coast of Sri Lanka. On the way, we saw a 30-metre-high Big Buddha Statue. It is a replica of the 6th-century Buddhas of Bamiyan destroyed by the Taliban in Afghanistan. It was created using the earliest known sketches of the statue. It was built in remembrance of the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami victims.We then travelled through the 222-kilometre-long Southern Expressway, Sri Lanka's first expressway linking the capital, Colombo, with Galle, Matara, and Hambantota, significant cities south of the island.On day five, we reached Colombo, the capital of Sri Lanka. Jetwing Colombo Seven hosted us in the bustling capital. We took a city tour early morning and visited Bally's Casino at night.On day six, we returned to Kathmandu early in the morning on a Sri Lankan Airlines flight, the airline that organised the trip in coordination with Jetwing Hotels Limited, a Sri Lankan hotel chain.National flag carrier Nepal Airlines, in its previous avatar as Royal Nepal Airlines, used to operate direct flights to Colombo during the 1980s. However, the carrier suspended operations following an armed movement by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) in Sri Lanka. There had been no direct air links between the two countries for decades.In 2016, Himalaya Airlines started a chartered flight that lasted a few months due to low traffic movement between the two countries. Sri Lankan Airlines started operating direct flights to Kathmandu in August 2021.“The main objective of this media tour is to increase tourism in both countries for mutual benefit. We want to draw Nepalis for pilgrims and leisure activities,” says Nilina Pathirana, Country Manager at Srilankan Airlines in Nepal.“We have understood that Nepali travellers tend to travel to Bangkok, Vietnam, Malaysia, Dubai, and Maldives. Nepalis have quite minimal knowledge about Sri Lanka and the religious connection between Lanka and Nepal. We want to promote Nepal and Sri Lanka jointly. This will be a win-win business,” added Pathirana.The airline said it currently carries 60 percent of the passengers from Nepal to Sri Lanka and beyond destinations like Tokyo, Sydney, Melbourne, and other Middle Eastern destinations. The return airfare for a 3.5-hour-long flight starts at Rs74,000. “We have a four-night, five-day package that begins from Rs80,000, depending on the properties and extended itineraries,” says Pathirana.Nepalis must submit certain required documents for visa processing, like their passport copy and bank statement. Due to this government-to-government policy, only Nepalis must obtain a prior visa. Otherwise, Sri Lankans are required to have a visa upon arrival.“The other best thing is that Sri Lankan Airlines can be involved with the visa process or facilitate the Nepalis tourists. Our main intention is to have a sustainable market in Kathmandu and make it a daily flight,” says Pathirana. \nMundhum Trek in Koshi province in the eastern part of Nepal is a new cultural walking trail. It passes through several indigenous ethnic villages and landscapes in Khotang and Bhojpur districts. This trail goes up to an elevation of 4,200 metres to the viewpoint of Silchung Peak and takes one through the settlements of the Kirati people. This route starts from Diktel Bazaar and passes through beautiful settlements like Chakhewa, Rawa Dhap, Salpa Bhanjyang, Silchung and Hanspokhari before ending in Bhojpur. There are some hotels in Diktel but trekkers are advised to carry tents. The trail offers panoramic views of most of the eight-thousanders, including Everest, Lhotse, Makalu, Cho Oyu and Kanchenjunga mountains. The spring season, March through May, is highly recommended for the trek.Janaki Mandir Janaki Mandir at Janakpur in Madhesh province was constructed in 1874 and is a blend of Mughal and local architecture. The temple is a three-storey building and has 60 rooms, making it the largest temple in Nepal. Pilgrims flock here by the thousands to pay homage to Janaki Mandir—Janaki being the other name of Sita, the daughter of King Janak. The temple houses an idol of Sita which was found near Ayodhya, the kingdom of Ram. The marriage anniversary of Lord Ram and Sita is celebrated in Janakpur every year on Vivaha Panchami, which falls in December. In the southwest corner of Janaki Mandir is the Vivaha Mandap, which has been built at the site where the marriage of Ram and Sita is said to have taken place. Another well-known temple in the vicinity is Ram Mandir, which is built in pagoda style and is hence different from the other temples in Janakpur that generally bear resemblance to Mughal architecture. It houses a female statue, said to be of Yogamaya, which has the reputation of being one of the most beautiful images of female forms in Nepal. Other holy sites of interest include the Laxman Temple, Sankat Mochan Temple and Hanuman Temple.Kuri Village, Kalinchok Kuri village, a popular tourist destination around 150 km from Kathmandu, lies at an altitude of 3,842 metres above sea level in Kalinchowk of Dolakha district, in Bagmati province. People visit the place to enjoy the snow during the winter besides the mesmerising landscapes and splendid panoramic view of the Himalayan range. Kalinchok gets snow mainly at the end of December and the snowfall continues till the end of February or mid-March. When there is snow, it is difficult for jeeps, buses and cars to reach the top of Kuri village. Chains are wrapped around the wheels of vehicles and specially modified jeeps with highly experienced drivers are used to carry visitors. There are several hotels and restaurants in the area. The road up to Kuri has also improved over the years.Annapurna Base Camp Annapurna Base Camp trek, in Gandaki province, makes for a picturesque journey that takes you to the foothills of the Annapurna South, up to 4,130 metres above sea level. The five-day trek (seven days for slow walkers) offers rich cultural diversities, typical Nepali villages and the flora and fauna nestled at the foothills of Annapurna. The distance from Pokhara to Annapurna Base Camp is approximately 81 kilometres. It is among the shortest and most budget-friendly treks in Nepal. For Nepalis, lodging costs around $5 to $10 per day. For foreigners, the overall cost of the trek ranges from $800 to $1500 on average per person. Annapurna Base Camp trek can be done at any time throughout the year as each season offers a different trekking experience. The ideal time for the trek depends on your weather preferences and what you expect from it. However, autumn (September to October) and spring (March to May) are considered the two best seasons for the trek, as the days at the time are warm and bright with clear skies.Bardiya National Park Bardiya National Park, located in the southern Tarai belt of Lumbini province, is home to one of the most elusive and majestic animals on earth—the Royal Bengal Tiger. The park, which covers an area of 968 square kilometres, is considered one of the most important protected areas in the country. It is a prime destination for those looking to catch a glimpse of a tiger. A bit of luck and patience will offer a good chance to see the Bengal Tiger. The jungle safari also offers one the opportunity to spot Asian elephants and the greater one-horned rhinoceros. The rare Gangetic river dolphins are occasionally spotted on rafting trips along the Geruwa River, the eastern channel of the Karnali river. Besides, visitors can enjoy the homestays and explore local Tharu culture. The right time to visit the park is from mid-September to mid-December and mid-February to May.Khaptad National Park Khaptad National Park in Sudurpaschim province is a protected area in the far western region. It stretches over four districts of Bajhang, Bajura, Achham and Doti and ranges in elevation from 1,400 to 3,300 metres. The park can be visited throughout the year. Trekkers are advised to bring their tents, food and other supplies. The Nepal Tourism Board says of late, social media has been increasingly influencing Nepali travellers to go to Khaptad. Since the far-flung Khaptad National Park is still offbeat for many travellers, the area remains pristine and fresh. The seasons of spring (March-May) and autumn (October-November) are the ideal times to visit the park. The temperature ranges from 10°c to 20°c offering pleasant trekking weather. The monsoon begins in June and lasts until September and during this time, roads often become muddy and slippery. From December to February, winter brings snow and chilling winds to the park.Limi Valley \nOnce again, my heart swelled with joy when my hometown came into view.Arriving at Lalikharka after the treacherous journey through Pauwa Bhanjyang and the bustling Kanchhi Dokan, Phidim, the headquarters of Panchthar district, revealed itself like a surprise gift. My home town, Phidim, is unique in the fact that it reveals to travellers approaching it from uphill. As the vehicle descends the mountain road, it slowly comes into view, its houses and buildings recognisable for the native son.This Dashain, I undertook the much-awaited trip to my hometown with my wife Kabita and daughter Aarohi. Little did I anticipate the transformation that awaited me.The moment I got out of the jeep, I noticed that Phidim, nestled in the lush hills, has undergone a remarkable transformation over the years. As I guided my family to my home, which had suffered damages in the 1989 quake that struck eastern Nepal, I found that old, mud and stone houses had been replaced by concrete buildings. The place was vastly different from the one I remembered.Arriving at my childhood home felt like reuniting with an old friend. Navigating its nooks and crannies with my daughter, we delved into the history of the house, a symbol of my cherished memories.My wife had visited Phidim years ago, spending a month with my parents. She, too, recalled beautiful moments she had had in the town. I asked the tenant about the neighbours and acquaintances. Some had died, while others had left for good.A call to local journalist Giriraj Banskota led me to the school grounds, where memories flooded back. This was where I spent my teenage years, playing ball, learning to kick, and watching major tournaments. Here, I even encountered a group of Western climbers headed to Kanchenjunga, the world’s third-highest mountain. I remember being awed by their shiny yellow tents, headlights and strange smell. I remember practising my tutephuteko Angrezi with the climbers. Birendra Shield, an annual sports tournament named after the late king, brought ace players from various schools in Panchthar district. The district also hosted Yuba Mela, an annual three-day fair to commemorate the birthday of the king, organising football tournaments in which teams from as far as Sunsari and Taplejung participated. I never excelled at dribbling balls. A boy growing up in a seven-member family, I soon found my interest in literature. In the late 1980s, Phidim hosted a major literary festival. In the run-up to the 1990 pro-democracy protest, walls were painted with anti-monarchy slogans, local politicians were arrested. I took my family to my school, Naya Namuna Secondary School. It was Saturday, so the school was closed. I peeked through the steel gate and wall, imagining myself labouring over classes. Memories are hazy, but what I remember most is going out of the school—to quiz contests with me leading the school team, to essay competitions at the District Education Office and to play carom board, a national pastime, in a nearby shopfront. Returning to the main street, the demolition of a landmark gate made me reflect on how cities transform, shedding old landmarks for new identities. Navigating narrow alleyways, I felt like a stranger in my own hometown. Multistory buildings have emerged and roads have been paved, reshaping the town. It’s the same place with a different face, leaving me nostalgic for the Phidim of my memories.We finally reached Shivalaya temple, which I told my wife and daughter was one of my cherished hangouts. A giant statue of Falgunanda (the Kirant leader’s birthday is celebrated on November 10) stood before the steps to the temple. Though my wife suspected I came here to smoke, in reality, I visited the temple in the evening to meet friends and talk about issues that mattered most to us at the time. It also offered a panoramic view of the town (I could not take my family to Gadhi Danda, a hillock across the Shivalaya).Towards the end of my journey, I felt sad about Phidim’s lack of prospects. To my dismay, I found that people have been leaving the town in droves. Despite blacktopped roads and multi-story buildings, Phidim faces a troubling reality. The lack of quality higher education and specialist healthcare has driven people away, echoing the circumstances that led me to Kathmandu years ago. Conversations with locals confirmed a mass exodus from the town, a trend that raises concerns about Phidim's future.My conversations with familiar strangers led me to conclude that Phidim has transformed into a transit town for pilgrims heading to Pathibhara Devi Temple, which is around 255 kilometres north in Taplejung district. I met dozens of people headed to the holy site. While pilgrims see it as a stopover, for me, it was a homecoming. The realisation dawned that Phidim is, perhaps, in a state of transition, trading its rustic charm for the hallmarks of urbanisation. While I left Phidim for higher education in Kathmandu, people from rural areas have flocked to the town in search of better opportunities, bringing life and energy to the once quiet community.As we bid adieu to my hometown, I couldn’t help but reflect on the inevitability of leaving a place, no matter how enamoured one is with it. Passing Kanchhi Dokan, I pointed out Kanchnajungha and Kumbhakarna to my daughter—symbols of my childhood. Phidim, now a blend of nostalgia and change, remains etched in my heart, a testament to the intricate dance between memory and evolution. \nUnilever Nepal, through its personal care brand Dove, officially sponsored Nepal’s National Women’s Football Team by presenting exclusive travel kits to 27 players and officials at the All Nepal Football Association (ANFA) office. This initiative highlighted Dove’s commitment to supporting the athletes on their journey to success, focusing on care, empowerment, and confidence.Dove aimed to strengthen its presence in football culture through a long-term, values-driven partnership, promoting women’s football and aligning with major tournaments such as the FIFA Women’s World Cup.Unilever Nepal hoped to foster positive societal change, creating emotional connections with audiences and building sustainable initiatives that extended beyond traditional sponsorships.As Nepali women continued to make strides in various sectors, Unilever Nepal recognised the potential of the national women's football team to inspire the future of women's athletics. \nLionel Messi scored his 10th international hat-trick and had a hand in two more goals as Argentina thrashed Bolivia 6-0 in South American qualifiers for the 2026 World Cup in front of an adoring home crowd at the Monumental stadium on Tuesday.Making only his second international appearance since recovering from an injury sustained at the Copa America in July, Messi capitalised on a mistake by defender Marcelo Suarez to open the scoring in the 19th minute.Bolivia goalkeeper Guillermo Viscarra made a couple of fine saves to prevent the hosts from extending their lead but he was beaten in the 43rd minute when Lautaro Martinez scored from Messi’s quick cross.Argentina made it 3-0 just before the break, with Messi setting up Julian Alvarez to score.Lionel Scaloni’s side controlled the second half and looked like they had extended their lead through Nicolas Otamendi, only to see the goal disallowed for offside.Substitute Thiago Almada did make it 4-0, however, scoring from Nahuel Molina’s pass in the 70th minute with the venue transformed into an Argentine party.Messi, 37, gave fans more reason to celebrate in the closing moments, beating two Bolivia defenders before unleashing a fierce shot past Viscarra to score his second.Messi needed only two more minutes to complete the hat-trick, joining Portugal’s Cristiano Ronaldo with the most in men’s internationals, the Argentine skipper scoring with a left-footed drive to take his tally to 112 goals for his country.“It’s really nice to come here, to feel the affection of the people, it moves me how they shout my name,” Messi said.“This drives me. Enjoying being happy where I am. Despite my age, when I’m here, I feel like a kid because I’m comfortable with this team. As long as I feel good and can keep performing the way I want, I’ll keep enjoying it.”Argentina are top of the standings with 22 points, having returned to winning ways after losing to Colombia last month and drawing with Venezuela last week.The 2026 World Cup will be hosted by the United States, Mexico and Canada. \nRaphinha converted a penalty in each half to guide an improved Brazil to a 4-0 home win over Peru in South American World Cup qualifiers on Tuesday.Building on last week’s 2-1 comeback win in Chile, Brazil looked livelier from the start and dominated possession, with late goals from Andreas Pereira and Luiz Henrique putting the gloss on an impressive performance.Brazil, who had lost four of five qualifiers before their win in Chile on Thursday, are fourth in the standings on 16 points after 10 games, trailing third-placed Uruguay on goal difference.“I think we needed this, it was really important winning both games to get back on track,” Raphinha told Brazilian television Globo.“They were two games that we managed to control. It’s a long way from perfect, but I believe we’re on the right track.”After hitting the crossbar in the 24th minute, Raphinha gave the home side the lead from the penalty spot in the 38th minute after Peru defender Carlos Zambrano was penalised for handball.The Barcelona forward extended Brazil’s lead from the spot in the 54th minute after Zambrano had fouled Savinho in the box.Substitute Pereira scored Brazil’s third with an acrobatic volley in the 72nd minute, brilliantly finishing a cross from Luiz Henrique, who wrapped up the win two minutes later with a low strike from the edge of the box.Argentina hammered Bolivia 6-0 and top the standings on 22 points, three points ahead of Colombia, who thrashed last-placed Chile 4-0.Davinson Sanchez opened the scoring for Colombia with a deflected header in the 34th minute and Luis Diaz doubled their lead early in the second half with an easy finish into an empty net after a bad mistake by the visiting side’s defence.Jhon Duran and Luis Sinisterra wrapped up the win as Chile suffered a fifth consecutive defeat in qualifying.Paraguay beat Venezuela 2-1 and are sixth on 13 points, level with fifth-placed Ecuador and one ahead of Bolivia in seventh. The top six sides are guaranteed a berth at the 2026 finals in North America. \nNepal's Head coach Rajendra Tamang announced the 23-member Nepal national women’s football team for the upcoming 2024 SAFF Women’s Championship on Monday, with Angila Tumbapo Subba named as the captain.

Taiwan has close though unofficial relations with the United States, a major arms supplier, and its allies.“No matter how many troops Taiwan has and how many weapons it acquires, and no matter whether external forces intervene or not, if it (Taiwan) dares to take risks, it will lead to its own destruction,” he added.“Our actions to defend national sovereignty and territorial integrity will not cease for a moment.”Chinese state media reported on Wednesday that President Xi had arrived the previous day on Dongshan island in China’s Fujian province, which faces Taiwan and where in 1953 China beat off an invasion attempt by Taiwan-based military.The world’s biggest luxury group has a growing problem with China.The defeated Republic of China government fled to Taiwan in 1949 after losing a civil war with Mao Zedong's communists. No armistice or peace treaty has ever been signed.Xi was on the island to learn about efforts to revitalise the countryside and the “passing on of red genes and strengthening the protection of cultural heritage”, the official People's Daily said, referring to the colour of the Communist Party.He urged officials from Fujian to promote cross-strait cultural exchanges, and “enhance the ethnic, cultural and national identity of Taiwan compatriots,” according to Xinhua news agency.'NEGATIVE EFFECT'Taiwan’s government rejects China’s sovereignty claims, saying only the island's people can decide their future.Speaking to reporters in Taipei earlier on Wednesday, Taiwan National Security Bureau Director-General Tsai Ming-yen said China's drills had backfired given the international condemnation they generated, especially from Washington.“The Chinese communists’ military exercise has created a negative effect in that it made the international community more supportive of Taiwan,” he said.Lai, in his Oct. 10 speech, said China has no right to represent Taiwan, but the island was willing to work with the government in Beijing to combat challenges like climate change, striking both a firm and a conciliatory tone which Taiwan officials said was a show of goodwill.Chen, the Chinese spokesperson, said Lai had stuck to his “stubborn separatist position”.“There was no goodwill to speak of,” Chen said.Lai has repeatedly offered talks with China but been rebuffed.China's military on Monday held open the possibility of more drills around Taiwan depending on the level of “provocation”.In a report to lawmakers, a copy of which was reviewed by Reuters, Taiwan’s defence ministry said China was trying to legitimise the use of force against Taiwan, to undermine military morale and to “deplete the military's combat power”.“In response to the severity of the enemy threat, the military continues to maintain a high degree of vigilance and make every effort to improve training and preparedness,” it said.China has over the past five years sent warships and warplanes in the waters and skies around Taiwan on an almost daily basis.On Wednesday morning, in its daily update of Chinese activities in the previous 24 hours, Taiwan's defence ministry said it had detected 22 Chinese military aircraft and five navy ships around Taiwan. \nChaaaiiittt…The spontaneous eruption of the sound of victory thundered through the neighbourhood of Nhyokha in the Kathmandu core. The line of a kite cut another. Looking out the window of her house, Sajani Shrestha saw children running full speed, shouting and fighting as they vied to catch the falling kite and thread. And craning her neck up to the sky, she could not count but only be mesmerised by the innumerable kites strewn across the skies of Nhyokha, Bangemudha, Indrachowk. “There would be so many kites that they entirely covered the blue of the sky, making beautiful patterns of different colours,” says the 51-year-old. “And you cannot imagine the number of times the call of chait rang in the air.”Clear blue sky and gentle westerlies, the season of kites has arrived in the Kathmandu Valley. While kites soared Kathmandu's sky mainly during Dashain, the kite season officially started in Nag Panchami (August) and ended on the Haribodhini Ekadashi (November). And from royalities to commoners, young and old all flew kites from rooftops and open grounds. Even those who did not, like Sajani, revelled in the live spectacle in the sky as kites soared and fought. With Bhimsen Thapa’s help, King Girvanyuddha flies kites The earliest written account of kite flying is believed to date to 200 BC in China. In Kathmandu, this tradition has religious and socio-cultural and environmental significance, says Tina Manandhar, lecturer of Nepalese History, Culture and Archaeology at Tribhuvan University. According to her, it is believed that kites in Kathmandu skies carry a message to the god of rain Indra that the valley's farmers have had enough rain for their crops. That is why Kathmandu farmers scolded anyone flying kites before plantation season.In an article ‘Changako Utpati Ra Bikas’ published in Gorkhapatra in 1995, historian Rajesh Gautam points to the lack of written documents indicating the exact time when kite culture was introduced in Nepal. Exploring different opinions on kite's introduction to Nepal, he writes that “some have opined the possibility that the skill and tradition of kite flying might have entered Nepal through India.” Yet some others, he writes, state that kites “came to Nepal from Japan during the time of [Rana PM] Dev Shumsher.”He concludes that most likely this tradition was introduced by Malla-era Newar traders: “But since Nepal’s relationship with Tibet and China is very old and direct, kites might have entered Nepal through the Newar traders who were engaged in the trade. One can estimate that the kite was introduced to Nepal during the (mediaeval) Malla regime.”In Social History of Nepal, TR Vaidya, Tri Ratna Manandhar and Shankar Lal Joshi write that there exists documented evidence of the kite flying from the early 19th century. The authors state that Sundarananda, a contemporary poet, has mentioned that the young king Girvanyuddha Bikram Shah (r.1799-1816), with the help of Prime Minister Bhimsen Thapa, flew kites from the towering temple of Taleju Bhawani, Hanumandhoka. And when the king's kite cut the kites of the youngsters, they were located and rewarded with money.In Tyas Bakhatko Nepal, Sardar Bhim Bahadur Pandey states that “During the month of Kartik [October-November] young and old all flew kites,” suggesting that kite culture was ubiquitous in Kathmandu by the early twentieth century.Anticipations and preparationsKite flying in Nepal requires a kite, a lattai (a wooden spool), thread and majha (homemade adhesive prepared by boiling snail slime, rice or sago, and powdered glass from burnt electric bulbs and coated on the line to sharpen it for kite fighting).77-year-old Nirmal Man Tuladhar, an avid kite flyer and retired professor of Linguistics at the Tribhuvan University, explains how Nepali tradition of kite flying was both expensive and needing advance preparation.“In our times, it wasn’t easy to fly kites,” he says. “We had to prepare majha …And as Nepali kites are fighter kites, we mainly fought with other kites [which meant we spent a lot of threads].”This preparation needed first and foremost of passing a hurdle: securing finances and materials to fly kites. While lattai was a one-time investment that could be saved for years, kites and threads had to be replenished every time a kite was cut.“Those were the times when parents wanted us to be more focused in our studies. They only gave money [to buy kites] after immense pestering,” says 80-year-old Dwarika Nath Dhungel, former Secretary of Nepal government, speaking of the 1950s and 1960s.Biodiversity specialist and botanist Tirtha Bahadur Shrestha, 86, was born in Mahabouddha and began flying kites from 1951-52. He saved what little money he got for afternoon snacks to buy Hattimar reel, a brand of line wound in a small lattai, which was strong and sharp and where majha stuck well.Raghuji Pant, a member of parliament, also recalls the difficulty in securing money to sustain his kite flying in and around Kathmandu core in the 1960s and early 1970s. “Four to five of my kites were cut in a day,” writes the 67-year-old in his 2019 article “Changa Jastai Udi Hidne Man” published in Himalkhabar. “[This caused] the line in the spool to shorten. From Bhadra [August-September] to one to one and a half months after Dashain I spent flying kites. So, it was difficult for me to have enough kites even after getting money from grandfather, grandmother, mother and everyone.”Kites and thread secured, now began the crucial work of preparing and applying majha whose strength determined how well it cut other kites. Govinda Tandon, 70, a historian and heritage expert, who grew up in Battisputali, was also an ardent kite flyer.“Materials for making majha were prepared right from the morning on a holiday,\" he writes in his article “Dashainko Butte Changa” published in Gorkhapatra. “Because this work couldn’t be accomplished without a collaboration of 3-4 friends, a holiday was set aside for this. Moreover, a sunny day was considered appropriate. If the majha didn’t dry, the thread could turn moist, and so if it felt like the day wouldn’t be sunny, the entire plan…was aborted.”Kite makers, kite sellers and variety of kites One of the oldest shops in Kathmandu's memory, Shree Chitrakar Kite Center in Tyauda, Asan is bustling with customers during Dashain. “When my grandmother got married and came to this house at age 12 [in early 1940s], this shop was already here,” says its fourth generation owner 47-year-old Dinoj Chitrakar. “So the shop must be around a hundred years old.”Another shop that stands out in Kathmandu's memory is Manandhar Kite Center in Kalimati, established in 1949, and currently run by brothers Mohan Man and Sundar Man Manandhar.In his book Antar Taranga, artist and writer Manuj Babu Mishra recalls “a kite shop near the old halwai shop of Chabahil” in the 1940s. Dhungel and his 1960 batchmates of Juddhodaya Public School recall the kite shops from the 1950s and 1960s – Bekhacha’s Shop at Netapacho, Bhaicha’s Shop at Nhyokha, Lata Manandhar’s Shop at Maru, Kanchha Buddha Bajracharya Shop at Tyauda.Besides the shops, there were makers and sellers of kites cloistered in different localities of Kathmandu Valley.In Kwalkhu, Patan was a Joshi who made Nepali paper kites.“One day I accompanied my uncle to buy kites,\" writes Dibya Giri, 69, in his 2023 article “Changa” in Sahitya Post. “I was amazed to see the huge stacks of kites there. We used to call it the house of the kite maker.”In Nhyokha, Purna Bahadur Shrestha began making kites as a teenager and started his own kite business in the 1950s, according to his daughter Sajani.These kites, made out of Nepali paper, often had different paintings. Mishra recalls painting kites for the kite shop in Chabahil.“I went to that kite shop and with the freely available colours and Nepali papers, I spent my day painting faces, birds, animals, masks, mountains, hills, whatever came to my mind,” he writes in the book. “Such kites apparently sold well!”Most septuagenarians and older generations like Tuladhar and Tirtha Bahadur recall flying kites made of Nepali paper when young. Tirtha Bahadur says that kites from Lucknow began coming to Kathmandu only after the late 1950s. But at least a section of Kathmandu was flying kites from Lucknow from the early twentieth century. Vaidya, Manandhar and Joshi write that the Ranas and Shahs imported kites from Lucknow and that from them, their favourite employees also got to fly some. These kites were large and, in Tyas Bakhatko Nepal, Pande writes that they were referred to as Lucknowia kites.Known for their characteristic hissing sound they made while flying, light body, swift movement and ability to take sharp turns, Lucknow kites were preferred by kite fighters.“Lucknow kites were lighter and could be manoeuvred well,” says Tuladhar. “Kites of Nepali paper were stable but difficult to manoeuvre. They were also expensive. So only some fighters flew Nepali paper kites.”The kites had different names depending upon their designs and colours – Ambe (a heart in the centre), Dibdibe (chequered), Pakhete (a different coloured paper on one edge), Sete (white-coloured), Nilchi (blue-coloured), Rate (red-coloured) and so on.The kite fighters preferred the strong and sharp Hattimar reel that came on a small lattai. The Belchamar reel was cheaper but weaker and prone to be cut by other threads. Kite fliers and kite watchers on rooftops and open groundsBibek Shrestha, 57, and his two brothers took stacks of kites and climbed their rooftops. The rooftops around theirs in the neighbourhood of Nhyokha – in fact in all core settlements of the Valley – were filled with kite fliers and spectators. Many risked precariously balancing on the sloped roofs.While Bibek and his brothers’ kites alighted to meet the sea of kites in the sky, their sister Sajani and other family members gathered around to revel in the live spectacle.Dhungel remembers the rooftops of Jhochhen and surroundings of the 1950s and 1960s swelled with kite fliers. Dhungel did try to fly kites. But he did not become a successful kite flyer. What he did become was, like Sajani and many Kathmandu residents, an admirer of kites soaring in the sky.“But more than engaging in my unsuccessful kite flying attempts, I enjoyed looking at the kites flying. There would be a big crowd of spectators. Females and other family members watched the kites fly as they ate meat and chiura. Some even drank and rejoiced as they flew kites.”When the age of cassette player and speakers dawned in the 1980s, songs blared from the speakers alongside kite flying. Chitrakar and Bibek invited their friends, put their favourite songs on speakers and spent entire afternoons flying kites, dancing, singing and eating.Away from the core cities, in the villages in the Valley, people flew kites in open fields. Like Dibya, who set his kite for flight from the banks of Godavari River in Tikathali. Chhauni was also a popular space for flying kites.Kathmandu’s joy in kite fightingBibek pulled his kite down and then manoeuvred it back up so his line touched his opponent's line from below and quickly reeled out his line. The resulting sharpness from the speed cut the opponent's line.Chaaaiiitttt………“The greatest fun comes from cutting another kite's string,” writes Tuladhar in his 1996 article “Cutting is the greatest fun” published in magazine Kite Lines. “With its coating of adhesive paste and ground glass, the string is as sharp and abrasive as sandpaper on your opponent's line.”Nepali kite, Tuladhar says, is made to fight other kites, and describes how a kite line cuts the other.“The technique is to touch your rival's string and immediately reel out line at high speed,” he writes. “The Nepalese style of kite flying is aggressive, and though the kites look simple, they are strategically designed for bringing down other kites.”At any given time, like Bibek’s kite above Nhyokha sky, skies above the Valley were filled with raging kites, swinging, coming down and going up as the fighters reeled in and out their lattais in ferocious attempts to bring down other kites.Meanwhile spectators cheered. “Even passersby stopped to look at the kites,” recalls Tina.The moment of a kite cutting was accompanied by the sound of chait, and children ran in the direction of the falling kite to grab it and the thread in what was termed as, Dibya says, changa lutne/dhago lutne.Dhungel always joined in to shout the chait resounding through the locality of Jhochhen and almost automatically his feet sped towards the severed kites' direction.“‘Oii leave that thread,’ the kite owner would scold me. ‘Why do you pull my thread, leave it right now.’ But I’d continue pulling the threads as the owner continued shouting. Other times I caught the kites that had failed to fly and dropped on the ground.”The fallen kites got stuck in the buildings, trees or poles, or glided down in the open grounds or paddy fields. Falling kites from the Kathmandu core settled down in Tundikhel covering it. Oftentimes kites fell on the fields to rest upon the lush paddy nearing its harvest.“Children ran straight into the fields to catch the kite,” says Dibya. \"They destroyed the crops by stepping on them. Some farmers chased them, scolding along as they did so and if they caught anyone, they slapped them.”Love and restrictions on kiteAmidst the raging kite fights high up in the sky, there were apparently also some quieter kites lingering much lower among the buildings or tree lines, for their goals lay in not ruthlessly cutting the threads of other kites but piercing softly through the hearts of their owners' love interests. During the Rana regime, there were designated public spaces to fly kites, writes Gautam in his article. Referring to oral accounts, he writes that the Ranas were particularly careful to avoid kite flyers around their durbars. This is because love-stricken men tied letters to kites and flew them into the durbars to their love interests among the nanis.He writes that the kites could be flown mainly on the grounds of Chhauni. Anyone flying kites in any other place and around Rana durbars were arrested.Pant also recalls love-stricken boys from his time. “Just as kites came in different colours and patterns, so did kite flyers,” he writes in the article. “Some wrote love letters using a few words in “symbolic language” on a plain kite and attempted to land it on the rooftop of the girl they liked. Some simply landed their kites on any rooftop if a girl appeared there and waited for reaction.”King Tribhuvan among kite fliersPande writes in his book: “Once or twice during kite season every year, King Tribhuvan went to Chhauni to fly kites. Legend has it that if the line of the king’s kite was cut, it flew to Lhasa. But since anyone who caught that kite received five rupees, everyone attempted to catch that kite.”In 2021 news report ‘Bhawanle Chhekidiyo Changa Udaune Aakash’ by Shivahari Ghimire published in Nayapatrika, cultural expert the late Satyamohan Joshi also recounts that “During Dashain, Tribhuvan came to the ground below Swayambhu to fly kites. […] He did not use the same thread to fly kites twice.”In the same article, Joshi says that the King also went to Budhanilakantha to fly kites and participate in kite flying competitions.End of season, end of cultureMohan Krishna Shrestha, 86, was born in Budhanilakantha. Every year, on the day of Haribodhini Ekadashi, he saw the annual fair at the Budhanilakantha Temple. He also witnessed kite fliers gathered in the open fields around the Temple.“Oh, it’d be a lot of people,” says Shrestha. “They came from all around Bhaktapur, Kathmandu and Lalitpur.”They flew kites on Ekadashi, Dwadashi and some even until Purnima.“They took all the remaining threads and kites that had survived Dashain and flew the last kites of the season,” says Tuladhar. “I remember my uncles, relatives and neighbours going to Budhanilakantha with their kites.”Joshi recalls in the 2021 article that King Tribhuvan also went to Budhanilakantha with his sons Mahendra, Himalaya and Basundhara. He greatly supported and also participated in the competitions there organised by the commoners. If he liked he gave prize money to the winners.This annual event lost its glory days after the decline in the open fields as buildings began to rise with the establishment of Budhanilkantha School in 1972, Mohan says.“The event survived in some form until the 1990s,” he says.But what happened after that?The end-of-the-season event in the 1990s was also an indication of the end of the age-old kite tradition.“If I go to my ancestral place in Asan to fly kites, it’s not possible for me to do that today because there are buildings everywhere,” says Tuladhar. “Cityscapes and urbanisation have created the obstacle for flying kites.”Dibya does feel like flying kites sometimes.“No space to fly kites today,” he says. “In the old times, there were river banks and open fields. Even if you fly kites, it gets stuck in somebody's rooftop or water tank or somewhere.”Yesteryear’s kite enthusiasts believe that increasing means of entertainment was another reason for the decline of kite culture.“When television came, kite flying started to slowly decrease,” says Bibek. “And then mobile phones robbed kite flying even more.”And so, when his sister Sajani cranes her neck up in the sky today, she rarely sees a kite.“Those days we heard one chait after another,” she says. “These days you won’t hear a single chait.” \nIn 2008 Matina Shakya was only three years old when she was appointed as the Kumari of Kathmandu. She was succeeded by Trishna Shakya as the new Kumari in 2017.Kumaris are revered as goddesses of beauty and strength in certain Hindu and Buddhist traditions. Worshipping young girls as Kumaris is a 2,000-year-old practice in Nepal. Since the 13th century, when the Malla kings ruled, the Newars of the Kathmandu Valley have been worshipping Kumari, a girl from the Shakya/Bajracharya community chosen to embody the divine energy of goddess Taleju Bhawani. The reign of a Kumari ends when she starts menstruating. So long as she is serving as the Kumari, she is believed to be the nation’s divine protector, safeguarding it from evil. Matina, 18, is now in her first year of college, studying for a bachelor’s degree in management. Her father, Pratapman Shakya, when asked about having a daughter who is the only living the goddess in the world said, “Not having your own daughter live in the same house as you seemed a little unfair, but we feel very proud to call ourselves the parents of the royal Kumari who is revered by people all over the world.”On March 9, 2023, he, along with Matina, were getting ready for a special function held to honour all former Kumaris from across Nepal. “There are often events to honour Matina as she was the royal Kumari, but this one was dedicated to all former Kumaris from different areas. There are 129 living Kumaris in all,” he added. Besides Kathmandu, Kumari tradition is followed in Bhaktapur, Lalitpur, and Kirtipur, among other cities.According to him, this was the first time an event like this was organised and the Deputy Mayor of Kathmandu, Sunita Dangol, was also in attendance.Throughout the year, many people line up outside the ‘Kumari Ghar’ to get a chance to visit the Kumari and get her blessings. Many foreigners stand out in the yard to catch a glimpse of her. Nepali people believe that if a Kumari smiles at you, it is a bad omen.Everyday, a tutor visits the Kumari to help her continue with her education as she is not allowed to step outside the Kumari Ghar. She takes her exams and does her homework from the Kumari Ghar itself. She also has the freedom to play inside the Kumari Ghar. Many former kumaris have pursued careers in their fields of interest or studied after their term ends, and they continue to be treated with the same respect. The tradition of Kumari has evolved over time. In the past Kumaris did not enjoy these freedoms.Because of various superstitious beliefs, Kumaris were not fully educated and were forbidden from getting married because of the belief that the groom would die soon if he married an ex-Kumari. They led secluded lives, were restricted from participating in normal childhood activities, and focused solely on their religious duties.However, now, these myths have been dispelled. Modern understanding has shifted to recognise that Kumaris, after stepping down from their divine role, have the freedom to marry and lead a normal life. The perception of Kumaris as isolated figures has evolved, with a focus on providing them with a more balanced upbringing. There have been initiatives to integrate Kumaris into regular social and educational settings, allowing them to have a more holistic and fulfilling childhood experience. “Matina was already familiar with the students from the school that she attended after her term as Kumari ended,” said Shakya. “The kids visited the Kumari Ghar frequently so that she could have a smooth transition,” he added. According to Gautam Prasad Shakya, who has been living as a caretaker in the Kumari Ghar, the changes made to the tradition are minor. “The traditions of Kumari have mostly stayed the same. All the rituals are still practised like in the old days,” he said.On 6 May 2005, Pun Devi Maharjan, a lawyer, filed a case in the Supreme Court claiming that the traditional practice of electing young girls as Kumaris, or “goddesses’, who are expected to follow certain social restrictions and appear at religious festivals, violated the rights of the child. Quoting Maharjan’s complaint, Puskar Mathema writes in Yuwamanch Monthly of October 2007, “If Kumari tradition is continued, it will undermine the fundamental rights as well the freedoms of children guaranteed by the constitution and child rights treaties. Apart from this, it will have a negative impact on their physical and mental development.”The case continued while Nepal overthrew the monarchy and declared itself a secular state in 2007. When the judgement was pronounced in 2008, the goddess was still in her role, now giving blessings to the country’s President. The court ordered that the Kumaris and ex-Kumaris receive better benefits and arrangements and ordered the government to improve their support and allowances.In April 2006, Prof Chunda Bajracharya filed a petition at the Supreme Court against Maharjan’s petition, who had argued against the Kumari tradition. Bajracharya contended that the tradition should be preserved as heritage due to its over 100 years of history.“People who don’t understand the culture shouldn’t comment on it,” she stated. Bajracharya also criticised the human right activists who contended that Kumaris were only allowed to wear the colour red. “People who say Kumaris are forced to wear red clothing all the time, are the same people who send their kids to schools in uniform,” she said.“After the 2008 court verdict, there have been a lot of improvements. Now, a teacher visits the Kumari Ghar daily to tutor the Kumari, who is expected to complete school assignments and sit periodic exams. All the former Kumaris now get benefits like scholarships and special pensions,” she added.Bajracharya is currently a professor of literature at the Tribhuvan University in Kathmandu.“The only significant change that the court verdict brought to the tradition was in terms of her education,” said Gautam Prasad Shakya, the caretaker. “Kumaris were tutored long before the case, but the case helped formalise this arrangement. After the court verdict, the time between 12 pm and 4 pm was designated as the Kumari’s tuition time,” he added.After the verdict, there was a concerted effort to provide Kumaris with access to quality education, enabling them to develop the skills and knowledge needed to lead fulfilling lives beyond their divine roles. There was also a shift towards ensuring that the Kumari's living quarters are comfortable, safe, and conducive to her overall well-being.Moreover, the selection process for the Kumari underwent reforms in the aftermath of the Pun Devi Maharjan case. There was a push for greater transparency, accountability, and inclusivity in the selection of the Kumari, with an emphasis on ensuring that the process was fair, respectful, and free from undue influence.Efforts were made to support their transition into adulthood, including providing them with comprehensive resources for education, vocation, and social integration. This shift aimed to address the challenges faced by former Kumaris and empower them to lead independent and fulfilling lives after their divine service.“The Kumari tradition has evolved over time. During the tenure of my daughter, we saw a lot of improvements. Even after her time as Kumari, Matina continued to get a lot of government support,” said Shakya, former Kumari Matina’s father.“Some people argue that child rights are being violated, but all of her rights are being upheld inside the Kumari Ghar. This is a unique and respected aspect of Nepali culture, and I don’t believe it violates any of my child’s rights.”While the Kumari tradition continues, its practices have evolved. “She enjoys this normal life and it didn’t take her long to adjust as well,” says Matina’s father, on her transition from the revered Kumari to the ordinary Matina. \nWhat animals did Juddha Shumsher have in his zoo?“We only have records of animals from the mid-1960s,” says Ganesh Koirala, who has been employed at the Central Zoo for the past 36 years and currently serves as its information officer and programme officer. “That too I hand-copied from an old torn-down file that I came across.”Today, the Central Zoo, which sprawls across six hectares in Jawalakhel, Lalitpur, houses as many as 1,298 wild animals of different species of mammals, reptiles, fishes and birds from Nepal and around the world—from tiger, rhinoceros, hippopotamus and red panda to its recent attraction: a pair of chimpanzees.After enduring decades of neglect under various government bodies, with its animals and infrastructure scraping along in a deplorable state, the zoo received a new lease of life with improved infrastructure and animal care in 1995, when it came under the management of the King Mahendra Trust for Nature Conservation (KMTNC), now known as the National Trust for Nature Conservation, in 1995.Today, the Central Zoo is an entertainment venue, one of the most happening places in the Kathmandu valley. Flocked by thousands of daily visitors, the zoo now also hosts rescued animals and those in need of rehabilitation. It is also a site for conservation education.But when Juddha Shumsher Rana (prime minister from 1932–1945) built the Jawalakhel Zoological Garden on the premises of his Jawalakhel Durbar (where Nepal Administrative Staff College stands today) in 1932, he did so purely for private interests—as a space of entertainment and amusement for him and his family.Built in the semi-wilderness of Jawalakhel around a historical pond dating to the 17th century during the reign of King Siddhi Narsingh Malla, the zoo also became the space he could use to show his respect for two women he revered, his mother and sister-in-law, and indulge in one of his favourite pastimes—gambling.Today, the Central Zoo, nestled in the heart of Jawalakhel's sprawling crowd, does not go unnoticed, and its story is well told. But what passions drove Juddha to build the zoo? What was its original layout? What animals did it have in the beginning? And how did Juddha spend time there?“I remember once seeing a small board that read ‘Jawalakhel Zoological Garden’,” Koirala says. “I don’t know whether it was from Juddha’s time or was made in the later years. It must surely be that Juddha built the zoo out of influence from the British given how this term was used by them.”Koirala adds, “There is a former employee, now an elderly gentleman who worked in the zoo in the 1960s. He surely has some stories from Juddha’s time.”Birds, beasts and palacesTo trace the birth of Jawalakhel Zoological Garden, one has to look at the history of Nepal’s rulers owning birds and animals.Like rulers around the world, Nepal’s royalty kept wild and exotic birds and animals in captivity as a source of pleasure and mark of wealth and power. The book ‘Social History of Nepal’ by historians TR Vaidya, Tri Ratna Manandhar and Shankar Lal Joshi details how Mallas during the mediaeval Kathmandu Valley to Ranas and Shahs in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries owned rare, exotic creatures. In 1708, a rhinoceros in Kathmandu Valley broke the iron chain in which it was bound and killed its tamer. In 1714, Bhaktapur’s King Bhupatindra Malla gifted a camel and an elephant to Kantipur’s King Bhaskar Malla to build peace.Among Shahs, King Rana Bahadur Shah in particular was reputed for his collection of birds and animals. He also owned a zoo outside his palace in Basantapur Durbar Square, where the Nepal Bank Limited stands in New Road today. The zoo contained “tiger, bear, monkey, elephant, horse, deer… heron, peacock… pigeon, wild dogs, rabbits, rats, mongoose.”Jung Bahadur Rana’s zoo on the premises of his Thapathali Durbar hosted a variety of birds and animals collected during his hunting expeditions as well as those brought from abroad. Jung Bahadur himself used to “supervise and inspect it”. Juddha Shumsher likewise had his own collection of creatures which steadily expanded into a zoological garden. Seeking wilderness in his Jawalakhel DurbarJuddha’s biographer Ishwari Prasad writes in ‘The Life and Times of Maharaja Juddha Shumsher Jung Bahadur Rana’ that between 1933 and 1940, Juddha shot 433 tigers, 33 rhinoceros and 93 leopards. An insatiable big-game hunter, Juddha had a deep fondness for being in the wild and among wild animals, and from this came, according to oral history prevalent among members of Kathmandu’s Rana community including Juddha’s descendants, the desire to own a zoo.Built in 1752, Schönbrunn Zoo in Vienna, the world’s first modern zoo, was already over 100 years old when Juddha was born in 1875. London Zoo opened in 1828 and Alipore Zoological Garden (Kolkata Zoo) in 1875. Nawab Wajid Ali Shah Zoological Garden (Lucknow Zoo) was established in 1921. Juddha’s inspiration, his descendants say, was most likely reinforced by his tours to zoological gardens during his visits to England in 1908 and to different Indian cities.An article titled ‘Central zoo in state of neglect’ published in The Kathmandu Post in 1996 says that Juddha one day “received a pair of leopards as a gift”, cementing his desire to own a zoo. A report ‘Central Zoo Master Plan’ prepared by the KMTNC in 1996 says that Juddha decided to build a zoo in an epiphany when he saw that some animals “including deer, a few rhinos, and some tigers had been collected from the Tarai and kept in Kathmandu” could be put into one compound in the “lonely piece of land with a large 16th [sic] century Malla period Pokhari”.The pond lay still and serene surrounded by green wilderness ever since Patan’s King Siddhi Narsingh Malla built it in the 1600s. On the grounds surrounding this pond, the Newars from Na:Tole, Pulchowk and surroundings had their devisthans where, for centuries, they gathered to perform their religious ceremonies during Basanta Panchami and Bhoto Jatra even after this area fell within the Jawalakhel Durbar.For the palace, the ground served as its extended garden along with a horse and elephant stable. Subodh Rana, 69, grandson of Juddha Shumsher, recalled his father Kiran Shumsher telling him that Juddha and his family sometimes also used the scenic grounds for picnics. If there was any spot where Juddha wanted to build a menagerie, it would be around this Pokhari (pond). One day, he called his grandson General Maheshwar Shumsher Rana and deputed him to the task of doing just this.The zoo’s layout—except for the small plots of lands acquired later—that was in place when it came under KMTNC's management was, the present and retired zoo officials believe, mostly the same as it was built by Maheshwar and so offers a peek into how Juddha’s zoo must have been like. Pond in the middle of the ground surrounded by enclosures—the southern bank housing mainly larger animals, and cages for birds positioned on the northern banks.From pigeons to the king of the jungleWhat animals and birds did the enclosures at Juddha’s zoo house?“We cannot tell for sure,” Koirala says.Once it came under government ownership, the zoo was tossed from one institution to the other for lack of interest and knowledge on the right institution to manage it. Amid all this chaos, documents were possibly lost and the zoo has no concrete record about the animals that Juddha must have once taken amusement at, said Koirala.Mukti Narayan Shrestha, 82, a retired secretary of the Nepal government, joined the Central Zoo in 1970 as a veterinarian when many original structures of the zoo were still intact. Shrestha also worked with an elderly khardar who, he says, was employed in the zoo since the time of Juddha and was about to retire when he joined.“In those days where the purpose of menageries was exclusively for exhibition and pleasure with no regard for the welfare and recreation of animals and birds, the cages were tiny and iron-barred,” Shrestha says.Elephant, horses, deer, monkeys, tiger, rhinoceros, clouded leopard, red panda, bear, palm civet (nir biralo), four-horned antelope, Himalayan goral, pheasants, Himalayan monal—from the mythical and the majestic, the gentle and friendly to the fiery and ferocious, Juddha’s zoo boasted them all, Shrestha says.Shrestha’s account is not different from the anecdotes passed down to other retired and present zoo officials and the members of the Rana community, who also detail the rare and the exotic fauna, like the gharial crocodile and porcupine, even the jungle’s king—creatures, they say, that Juddha must have received from foreigners as gifts—appearing alongside domestic birds like pigeons.Tidbits of published information also confirm that the zoo had a good collection of exotic birds and animals from Nepal and abroad. One such suggestion comes from Kalyan Shumsher’s ‘Shree Teen Juddha Mahima’ published during Juddha’s reign in 1943.“One need not travel abroad to see the incredible birds and animals found in foreign countries,” he writes. “It will suffice to see [those creatures] right here in the zoo opened by His Holiness Shree 3 [Juddha] in Jawalakhel.”Among these incredible creatures, one reigned supreme—lion, the king of the jungle.For one, it would not have satiated Juddha to build a zoo and not have the jungle’s king exhibited in it. Juddha hence must have done everything possible to ensure one for the zoo. Infrastructure at the zoo suggests that the lion indeed lived at Juddha’s zoo or, in the least, during the Rana regime.“Where bear habitat lies today, there were two dome-shaped attached enclosures with a holding room, constructed in the classic architecture that many enclosures in the British zoos had in the past. They had brick walls and lime plaster,” Koirala says. “These were built to house a lion in one cage and a tiger in the other.”Near these enclosures stood another cage that remains intact today, with the head of a roaring lion carved out of the wall on the top of its iron bars. Zoo officials as well as members of the Rana community believe that Juddha had this exhibit built to specifically house a lion.Remarkably, these Juddha-era infrastructural spaces are corroborated by a rare piece of photographic evidence. A 1946 photo of the zoo shows a lion while a Kathmandu mother and her sons stand in front of its cage.Juddha’s place of piety and playThe zoo was not merely a space that Juddha sought out for amusement and retreat in the outpost of his palace; he also used this place to express his deepest affection.This affection spills right at the zoo’s entrance, in the form of the life-size statue of Karma Kumari Devi, wife of Juddha’s elder brother and Rana Prime Minister Dev Shumsher. Karma Kumari stands tall in her regal costume shaded by a wide canopy. Juddha revered Karma Kumari because it was she who raised him and looked after his mother Juhar Kumari Devi after the death of his father Dhir Shumsher. On another prominent part of the zoo on the south-east, Juhar Kumari’s enthroned statue overlooks the pond. Juddha had commissioned the London-based sculptor Domenico Antonio Tonelli to cast these statues.When Karma Kumari’s statue was unveiled is not clear, but Juhar Kumari’s statue was unveiled by Juddha amid a grand function in 1935 on Jawalakhel’s most auspicious day, Bhoto Jatra. It was attended by the British Resident Frederick Bailey.“On June 28, 1935, at Jawalakhel Durbar… the pond nearby looked very scenic,” says a Gorkhapatra news report titled ‘Statue installation’ dated July 5, 1935. “Because it was the day of Bhoto Jatra of Machhindranath… and moreover since an ideal woman’s statue was being unveiled, there was a crowd of lakhs of people.”Less than fifty metres from Karma Kumari’s statue stands a one-story building with a pagoda roof that today serves as the zoo’s meeting hall. Juddha, an avid gambler, found the scenic semi-wilderness covered in trees and filled with the sounds of wildlife to be a perfect place to relish the game. So he built a building with twelve doors on its four sides allowing him and his fellow gambling compatriots the freedom to enter through a particular door that they thought would bring luck. He called it his Juwa Ghar, the gambling house, and built it with the sole purpose of indulging in the game he loved. Roar of lion reverberates in KathmanduThe sounds of the animals and birds in the zoo rose up in the Jawalakhel sky. Every day, until much later in the 1970s, roar of the zoo’s lion (there were later other lions) diffused to far corners of the Valley, merging the zoo with the spirit of Kathmandu and informing the city folks of its presence.But was the zoo open to the public as well?“I think once it was built, the zoo was open for the public,” Subodh Rana said. “It is unlikely that Juddha Shumsher built such a large zoo and kept it only for his family.”For one, Kalyan Shumsher mentioning that one “need not travel abroad to see the incredible birds and animals found in foreign countries” suggests that the public had at least some access to the zoo. Of course, the Newar community from Na:Tole, Pulchowk and surrounding areas were permitted inside the zoo on the days of their guthi functions on Basanta Panchami and Bhoto Jatra.As the zoo was established at the back of the ground where Bhoto Jatra celebrations happen, it naturally filled with revellers on this day in addition to the guthi ritual observers as testified by the Gorkhapatra report. The photo of the mother and her sons also bear testimony that the zoo was not entirely closed to the public.What is widely believed, though, is that the zoo officially came under government ownership after Nepal became a democracy in 1951. And it would still be a few more years before it was open to the public in 1956.In 1945, Juddha gave up his power and eventually retired in Dehradun, India, where he died in 1952. With time, Jawalakhel Zoological Garden became the Central Zoo. It would take many avatars—a neglected site of crammed, unmaintained cages with sad eyes of emaciated creatures staring from behind the bars, a focal point of animal diplomacy, particularly during the period of monarchy, to, in its recent decades, a space of conservation and education.When all this was happening, the city sprawled around Jawalakhel, subduing the lion’s roar with its noise. More wildlife from around the country and the world came—creatures captured from the wild, those sold by circuses, those rescued from traffickers. Fate would bring these creatures to the care of generations of Kathmandu folks, intertwining each other’s joys and sorrows. After the tale of Juddha’s Jawalakhel Zoological Garden, there would be these stories to tell. Sitting around a table inside Juddha’s Juwa Ghar, Koirala and other zoo officials begin unfolding these stories before me. \nNepal’s book market is no stranger to the popular Bangladeshi-Swedish writer Taslima Nasrin. Almost all of her books have been translated into Nepali, but Nasrin herself says that they are all unauthorised translations. “All books [Nepali translations] are pirated versions,” Nasrin told the Post in a Whatsapp conversation. Nasrin, who is currently in exile in India after facing death threats in Bangladesh following the publication of her novel Lajja (Shame), said that she or her publishers have never allowed anyone the right to translate her books into Nepali. “I don’t know of any such Nepali publishers. No one asked for permission and no one has paid [me] royalty.”Translating and publishing books without permission from authors or publishers is a punishable crime. But Nepal’s book market is full of such unauthorised translations and prints of books written by the who’s who of the world literature. Such endeavours haven’t just hurt the authors but also the readers, says Ajit Baral, publisher of the Kathmandu-based Fineprint publication. “These translations are poor,” Baral says. “Tomes with 1200–1300 pages have been trimmed to 200–300 pages. An example is the biography of Bill Clinton.”Another popular book that has seen unauthorised Nepali translation is the biography of Steve Jobs by Walter Isaacson.“We have no official deal in place for a [Nepali] translation of Steve Jobs,” Peppa Mignone, associate agent of the CAA, the translation authority of the biography, said in an email interview with the Post.The book’s Nepali translation is published by Panchpokhari Publication House. The translated book identifies the translator thus: “Achyut Koirala, who has a master’s in English literature, is primarily a journalist. He is currently affiliated with Nagarik daily. He keeps a close tab on international history, politics and culture and has written scripts and dialogues for half a dozen Nepali films. He has published over a dozen non-fiction books.”Koirala, who admits to the unauthorised translation, claims that he hasn’t just translated the book but has also done ‘creative writing’ with it.‘Rich Dad Poor Dad’, written by Robert Kiyosaki and Sharon Lechter, is among the books that’s perennially on the bestseller list across the world. Upon investigation, the Post found three Nepali translations of the book—all unauthorised. One of them is translated by Dilip Kumar Shrestha and published by the same firm, the Panchpokhari Publication House. Another Nepali iteration of the book is published by Book For All publication and translated by Kopila MD. Yet another Nepali version is translated by one Sudheer Dixit and published by Plata Publication, Kathmandu.In an email conversation with the Post, Ronson Taylor, who oversees the international rights at The Rich Dad Company, said, “At this point in time, we do not have a relationship with an established publisher in the [Nepali] language market. If there are any Rich Dad Poor Dad books currently for sale in the Nepali market, they are pirated.”Basanta Thapa, a writer and translator, says that many books are being translated of late to make easy money. “But how would the quality of these unauthorised translations be!” Thapa wonders. “Readers who haven’t read the original wouldn’t know the faults in the translated versions.” Thapa says that any translator worth his salt aims to ‘recreate’ a book and it takes much work to do that.Taslima’s books are the major victimsTaslima’s memoir Uttal Hawa has been translated into Nepali as ‘Sangharsha’, literally Struggle, and is published by Khoji Publication House. Even though the book in its cover claims that it is an authorised translation from the English version Wild Wind, it is a pirated one. The book is translated by Bikash Basnet and edited by Bhogiraj Chamling. A revised version of the book is edited by Sangeet Srota (Yam Bahadur Chhetri).The same publication house has also published the Nepali translation of the book’s sequel as ‘Prem ra Jeevan’. Publisher Sushil Chalise says that while he is aware that one needs to receive permission from the author or the publisher to translate a book, his efforts to contact Taslima were unsuccessful. Therefore, he had published the version the translator made available to him. Translator Basnet, too, admits he translated the book without Taslima’s permission. “About a decade back, we didn’t know how to ask for permission,” he said.Nepal has the Copyright Act (2002) in place. Before it, there was the The Patent, Design and Trade Mark Act, 2022 (1965) that included intellectual property in its 2006 revision. Even the Muluki Ain (Civil Code) of 1910 BS had a provision about copyright. Moreover, it goes without saying that translating somebody else’s work without permission is immoral.Likewise, Indigo Ink Pvt Ltd has published a Nepali translation of Taslima’s anthology of essays No Country for Women as ‘Aaimai ko Kunai Desh Chhaina’. The book is translated by Krishna Giri and edited by Pramod Pradhan. “I have no idea about the agreement between the publisher and translator,” Pradhan, who is also a children’s book writer, says. “I just copy-edited it upon request.”Bishnukumar Poudel, publisher of Indigo Ink, however, claims that he is still trying to take translation rights for the book. “We translated the book long ago,” he says. “We are still trying to get translation rights.”Indigo is also publishing unauthorised translations under its imprints All Book Store Pvt Ltd, Book for All and Plata Publication. It has published two versions of Rich Dad Poor Dad under those shadow imprints. But Plata Publication is not registered in the Company Registrar’s Office.Pradhan says that many foreign books have had unauthorised translations in Nepali and their quality is poor. Those books are translated not from the original language but from a second or third language, so these translations are bound to have problems, he says. “After I learned that those were unauthorised translations, I have stopped editing them,” Pradhan said.Indian author Shiv Khera’s You Can Win has been translated into Nepali by Bloomsbury India and has granted the distribution rights to Ekta Books. But the book’s unauthorised translations are also found in the market and they don’t even mention the name of the publisher and translator. What is interesting is they mention that it’d be illegal to republish the book, or an excerpt of it, without the author’s permission.The Nepali translation of the book, which was poorly written and rife with inaccuracies, had landed the publisher at court. After a complaint was filed at the District Court Kathmandu in 2066BS on the charge that the publisher violated the copyrights and economic rights, the court had issued a verdict on Mangsir 11 that year, charging a fine of Rs10,000, Rs20,000 and Rs30,000 to the defendants Netra Prasad Pokharel, Narayan Prasad Bhusal, and Bhagwati Risal and Bishnu Silwal, respectively.Baral, the Fineprint publisher, says that international publishers wouldn’t demand much for translation rights given Nepal’s small market, but Nepali publishers do not bother to reach out to them. “Publishers who put out unauthorised translations and sell them at 50 percent discount have troubled publishers like us,” he said.Fineprint has published authorised translated versions of books such as Leaving Microsoft to Change the World by John Wood, Healed by Manisha Koirala, and Hippie by Paulo Coelho. The publication house is also set to release the Nepali translation of Israeli historian Yuval Noah Harari’s bestseller Sapiens. Translated into Nepali by Dinesh Kafle, the book’s translation right was acquired at the cost of USD1300, Baral said. Likewise, the publication acquired the translation rights of Sadhguru’s Inner Engineering at IRS93,000, he added.Baral says that publication of unauthorised translations is an immoral and illegal work. “This phenomenon not just hampers Nepal’s fledgling book publishing industry but also tarnishes the country’s reputation in the global market,” Baral said.Thapa, the writer and translator, points out the lack of regulatory mechanisms in the country. “We don’t have an agency that regulates the quality of translations being done,” he says. “Nobody compares the translation with the original. We need a dedicated authority to enhance the quality of translation.” Universities, Nepal Academy and other stakeholders can play a role to uplift the translation sector, he adds.One’s pain, another’s pleasureWhen the author Suketu Mehta was travelling through Mumbai, a young man approached him with a handful of books while his vehicle was stuck in traffic. Brandishing Maximum City, written by none other than Mehta himself, the young man requested the author to buy a copy. Suketu leafed through the book and said, “This is a pirated copy and I’m the author of this book.” The youth wasn’t bothered and replied, “Okay, you can buy it at a discount.”This anecdote was shared to the Post by Mehta’s friend, the author and professor Amitava Kumar, in an email exchange.Most of these pirated books are imported into Nepal from India while the retailers of original books are finding themselves increasingly in trouble. “We sell original copies but many readers doubt us as well, given the ubiquity of pirated versions,” says Anjan Shrestha, operator of Education Book House, Jamal.Ramchandra Timothy, chair of Thapathali-based Ekta Books Pvt Ltd, said that the phenomenon of piracy has tarnished Nepal’s image internationally. “There was a time when Bangladesh would be known as ‘piracy king’,” he said. “Now there's a risk Nepal would take the crown.”As tax increases, so does piracyThe government decision to impose a 10 percent tax on book imports in fiscal year 2019-20 led to a proliferation of pirated book markets, booksellers say. After the decision, booksellers started to cut back on imports and that led to the entry of a new crop of pirated booksellers, a trader in Kathmandu says. But following widespread backlash, then finance minister Bishnu Paudel struck down the policy.“After the government’s decision, we stopped importing books for a while,” says Shrestha of Education Books. “The import of books went down for about two years. Then the pirates stepped in to fill the gap. It was about that time that pirated copies of biographies and memoirs of Obamas and Jai Shettys became omnipresent in the market.”Pirated copies of classics by Roald Dahl and JK Rowling also made an entry in the Nepali market. Then the phenomenon only saw a rise.Since the customs department does not levy duty on foreign books and also does not care to differentiate between the pirated and original copies, unauthorised books have found a safe haven in Nepali market.The government doesn’t levy any customs duty on books and newspapers published by foreign publishers abroad. The importers should only pay Rs565 at the customs points. But Nepali publishers have to pay 10 percent tax to import books printed in India.James Taylor, director of Communications and Freedom to Publish of the International Publishers Association, says that the government, publishers, writers and readers should join hands to control widespread piracy. “The government should realise that book publishing and reading culture contribute to the country’s economy as well,” he said, adding that the government should seize pirated books and close websites that sell pirated ebooks.Nandan Jha, executive vice chair of Penguin Random House India’s sales, production and business department, says that piracy has emerged as a big challenge for publishers of late and has harmed the authors, publishers, distributors, printers, readers and other stakeholders. “To confront piracy, all the stakeholders should launch a special joint effort,” Jha told the Post in an email exchange.Piracy has proliferated in the Nepali market to such an extent that the publishers of such books and unauthorised translations keep whatever ISBN numbers they like, often conflicting with other books, and still get off scot free. If scanned or searched on the internet, the ISBN number gives details on the author of the book, what the book is about, and its price, among others.Bijay Sharma, information officer at TU Library, says, “Keeping ISBN number at one’s will is illegal. If anyone files a complaint, we can punish them.”By the lawThe Muluki Ain-1910 BS had mandated that a publisher take permission of Gorkha Bhasa Prakashini Samiti before publishing any material. The Copyrights Act came into effect in 2022 BS and was amended in 2054 BS. In 2059 BS, a new Act was promulgated and it is still effective now. Authorities are currently working to amend the Act to give the registrar’s office more autonomy regarding copyright.According to the 2059 BS Act, copyright violations are considered government cases. In such cases, plaintiffs should file a complaint with the police. The Act’s clause 25 has various conditions that amount to violation of copyright. The Act’s subclause A says that if a publisher produces or copies material in writing or sound and sells or distributes it, it amounts to violation of copyright.Likewise, the Act’s clause 26 prevents selling of unauthorised material. The clause restricts the ‘importation of copies of work or sound recording, either made in a foreign country or sourced otherwise, into Nepal for business purpose shall not be permitted if preparation of such copies would be considered illegal if they were prepared in Nepal.’If anyone infringes upon protected rights, they are liable to punishment but the provision’s implementation remains lax.The law gives the authority to district court to take legal action against copyright violators.Advocate Parshuram Koirala says that if the government becomes more proactive, it can punish violators on the basis of the 2059 BS Act and thereby control the phenomenon of intellectual theft and copyright violations. “Creation is a crucial part of humanity’s benefit,” he says. “If intellectual property is not protected effectively, then there’d be no inspiration to create something.”Bal Bahadur Mukhiya, a professor at Nepal Law Campus, suggests the inclusion of rules about digital piracy in law, and also the clauses of various related international treaties and agreements that Nepal is part of.“In the US, a teacher or professor should pay a certain revenue even to photocopy a chapter of some text for teaching purposes,” Mukhiya says. “But in Nepal, those who photocopy an entire book and sell it go scot free.”(This report is prepared in collaboration with the Centre for Investigative Journalism, Nepal.) \nThe academic community in Nepal has been buzzing with discussions about research and publishing for quite some time now. This trend is noticeable, especially with the rise of academic institutions—business schools in particular—that have established research centres to support both faculty and students. Many of these institutions highlight their research endeavours on their websites. Furthermore, independent research and consulting organisations that claim to undertake high-quality research have proliferated in the country. Upon reviewing their reports, it becomes apparent that many are simply collections of facts, lacking in-depth analysis and scientific rigour. These documents appear more like consulting assignments aimed at meeting client demands quickly rather than fostering genuine knowledge creation. Although they may superficially resemble research, they do not possess the rigorous standards characterising true scientific inquiry.Disconnect between academia and industryAs a coordinator of the academia-industry interface at a business school, I frequently interact with clients who approach us with research requests. Many of these domestic and international clients demonstrate a surprising lack of understanding of the research process. For example, I once had a conversation with a representative from an international organisation who wanted us to conduct a national-level study involving a mixed-method research design—within two or three months. This unrealistic expectation reflects a broader misconception among many clients that research is quick and inexpensive work when it is a complex, time-consuming process that requires significant resources.The misunderstanding extends to domestic clients as well. Often, they request research work at the last minute, either because they have leftover funds to spend or because they need documentation for their ongoing projects. These clients fail to realise that research is about \"searching again\"—a meticulous process of exploration and discovery aimed at generating new knowledge or enhancing existing theories. It cannot be rushed. Professionals often view research as gathering information without appreciating the systematic methods and discipline necessary for conducting scientific investigations.State of scientific research The government's investment in research is alarmingly low. Nepal spends approximately 0.03 percent of its GDP on research and development, with only 0.011 percent of the education sector's budget allocated to innovation. This figure is minuscule compared to what is required to foster a vibrant research culture. In the most recent budget, Rs197.29 billion was allocated to the Ministry of Education, Science, and Technology (MoEST), which included a plan to establish a fund dedicated to research and innovation of Rs1 billion. Considering Rs1 billion, it effectively comes to 0.01 percent of GDP for research alone. The government also aimed to promote research and capacity development in institutions affiliated with Tribhuvan University, such as Centre for Economic Development and Administration (CEDA), Research Centre for Educational Innovation and Development (CERID), and Centre for Nepal and Asian Studies (CNAS). However, despite these announcements, only a few initiatives have come to fruition.There are many reasons for the lack of research output. First, for many academics, research is simply a requirement for promotion. Faculty members are often burdened with administrative responsibilities, leaving little time for meaningful research. This issue is not unique to Nepal but is a global challenge. Second, findings from research are primarily shared with a select group of subscribers or funding bodies, limiting their impact and visibility. There is a growing need for research to be more widely disseminated and reach the broader public.Third, there is a lack of support for researchers. PhD aspirants in Nepal face additional financial barriers. Unlike in many other countries, where PhD students receive full funding, students in Nepal often have to pay tuition fees, discouraging many from pursuing advanced research. The government and universities must provide better financial support for PhD students to ensure that talented researchers do not leave the country searching for better opportunities abroad.Barriers faced by academiciansMany Nepali universities do not prioritise quality publications. Sadly, these are not considered a criterion for promotions. Additionally, academic leaders lack awareness of ranked journals and quality parameters and indexes. My conversations with colleagues at various higher education institutions (HEIs) reveal another significant barrier to research productivity: Promotion to administrative roles. Several dedicated researchers find that once they are promoted to dean or associate dean positions, they no longer have the time to conduct research. This problem is compounded by the fact that most HEIs do not allow faculty members the flexibility to focus exclusively on research, forcing them to juggle administrative duties alongside their academic work. Nepali academicians also face significant challenges in accessing up-to-date software for data analysis and quality journals, as most universities in the country do not subscribe to the high-quality academic resources available at many international institutions. This lack of access restricts their ability to publish in reputable outlets. Furthermore, even if a researcher manages to get published in a prestigious journal, universities in Nepal are often unable to cover the article processing charges (APCs), which many institutions abroad pay for. Additionally, unlike reputed Indian HEIs, where faculty are incentivised to produce high-quality research articles and case studies, such a system does not exist in Nepal. As a result, faculty members have little motivation to prioritise research, leading them to focus predominantly on teaching responsibilities. The University Grants Commission (UGC), established under the University Grants Commission Act of 1993, allocates a large portion of its budget—about 50.4 percent—to Tribhuvan University, leaving little for other institutions. The UGC's Research Development and Innovation Programs Implementation Guidelines (2019) aim to support junior faculty members and PhD students, but the process is often challenging. My experience with the UGC when applying for a PhD scholarship was frustrating. Despite meeting the eligibility criteria, my application was rejected without clear reasoning, leaving me disillusioned.Cultivating a research cultureUniversities in Nepal should serve as knowledge centres that actively produce new knowledge. Academicians must seek research funding from domestic and international sources at both the individual and institutional levels. The UGC should develop mechanisms to allocate research funds based on the quality of research output, with clear indicators such as publication in reputable journals and citation counts. Those who contribute significantly to high-quality research should be incentivised, ensuring their work gains recognition within Nepal and the global academic community. Without such incentives, research in Nepal will remain underappreciated and disconnected from the broader international research landscape. In conclusion, cultivating a genuine research culture in Nepal requires concerted efforts from all stakeholders. Leaders in academia, governments and businesses must all recognise the importance of research for scholarly and broader national growth. With sufficient financing, institutional support and dedication to scientific rigour, Nepal can foster an atmosphere where research flourishes and advances knowledge worldwide. \nGig economy is expanding rapidly worldwide, and Nepal is no exception. According to a 2015 RAND American Life Panel survey, alternative work arrangements in the United States increased from 10.7 percent in 2005 to 15.8 percent by late 2015. Today, the US gig economy is valued at about $1 trillion and is projected to grow at an annual rate of 16 percent. By 2027, it is expected to offer nearly 100 million gig jobs—far exceeding Nepal's yearly GDP. In South Asia, the economy is booming, with India leading the way. The number of gig workers in India rose from 6.8 million in 2020 to 7.7 million in 2021, and projections suggest it could reach 23.5 million by 2029. Bangladesh follows closely, with approximately 6.5 million gig workers.The gig economy consists of flexible, short-term jobs often facilitated online. These range from ride-sharing and food delivery to freelance work and e-commerce. Popular global platforms for ride-sharing include Uber, Lyft, Ola and Grab, as well as freelancing sites like Upwork and Fiverr. A software engineer in Kathmandu can work on projects for a tech company in the US or offer online training programmes nationwide.Gig economy in NepalIn Nepal, the gig economy is gaining momentum due to urbanisation, technological advancements and increased access to digital services. Platforms like Pathao, Tootle and Foodmandu are becoming commonplace, allowing workers to set their own schedules. However, as it is still developing, reliable data on its size and impact are severely lacking. Many individuals are unaware of how gig platforms function, including their advantages, risks and legalities.Flexibility is a significant attraction for gig workers, enabling them to choose when and how much they work. Yet, this type of employment also comes with challenges such as job insecurity, unpredictable incomes and a lack of traditional benefits like health insurance and retirement plans. Despite these obstacles, the gig economy has the potential to help alleviate unemployment and poverty by offering short-term income opportunities. It offers various job opportunities for people with varying skill levels, from highly skilled positions like software engineers and programmers to semi-skilled and unskilled roles such as delivery drivers and ride-share operators. Additionally, it has been especially beneficial for women, allowing them to work flexibly, earn an income and overcome traditional work barriers.A recent study by a team of graduate students at Tribhuvan University highlights Nepal’s gig economy structure. The researchers surveyed 385 gig workers in the Kathmandu Valley, focusing on sectors like ride-sharing, online tutoring, e-commerce delivery, food delivery and freelancing. Notably, older individuals are more likely to engage in gig work compared to younger ones. High unemployment rates may compel older workers to continue their roles, while younger people often prioritise stable, traditional jobs, missing out on potential gig benefits. The study also found that individuals already employed are more likely to pursue gig work for extra income. Financial incentives play a crucial role; higher earnings from gig work encourage participation, indicating that families with lower incomes often rely more on these opportunities. Job satisfaction is also important for retention, with many gig workers continuing in their roles due to a sense of fulfilment.Ride-hailing services are a major component of Nepal's gig economy, but they come with significant challenges. The study indicates that ride-hailing workers face legal and regulatory uncertainties. Despite being legally recognised in 2019, gaps in the regulatory framework still pose problems. Additionally, social security and health care issues affect many ride-hailing workers, while others struggle with low pay and finding enough customers.This research is among the first to offer an empirical analysis of the gig economy in Nepal, providing insights into the gig workforce. Key benefits identified by respondents include earning potential, cited by 48.19 percent, and schedule flexibility, noted by 18.39 percent. However, legal and regulatory uncertainty was reported as a significant challenge by 37.56 percent of participants, while social security and health issues affected 32.64 percent. The survey also revealed that gig workers see a strong need for improved financial and saving options, with 34.72 percent highlighting this as crucial. Other essential support measures included tax benefits, performance-based bonuses, and calls for legal protections and better working conditions.Estimating the exact size of Nepal's gig market is complicated by a lack of legal frameworks and regulatory oversight. In developing economies like Nepal, where most financial transactions occur through informal channels, the growth of the gig economy creates an additional challenge for the government in regulating these financial activities and integrating them into legal systems. Additionally, the informal nature of the gig economy complicates tax regulations. Similarly, there is a noticeable gender gap in the gig labour market, especially in ride-sharing and delivery services, where women are largely missing, raising concerns about women's exclusion from these emerging job opportunities.Necessary interventionsPolicymakers have an opportunity to implement targeted interventions aimed at enhancing the inclusivity and sustainability of Nepal's gig economy. This could include financial incentives for workers transitioning between jobs, income support programmes, initiatives to improve job satisfaction and health and skill development training tailored to the needs of the gig market. Such measures would benefit gig workers and contribute to a more equitable and robust labour welfare in Nepal. As the gig economy continues to grow, addressing its challenges and utilising its potential will be crucial for creating a sustainable future for workers in Nepal. With the right policies and support, this evolving labour market could provide significant opportunities for many, helping to drive economic growth and improve living standards across the country. \nFor the past few weeks, Pakistan has been embroiled in intense negotiation and political bargaining to pass a constitutional package bill in the Parliament. The ruling Pakistan Muslim League-Noon (PML-N) does not have the numbers to muster the support in the Parliament. This amendment is politically significant for the PML-N. On the other hand, Fazlur Rahman of the Jamait-ul-Ulema Islam-Fazl (JUI-F), with eight seats in Parliament, is in for hard bargaining. It has insisted on arriving at a political consensus and has requested the government to delay the bill. The government appears to be in a hurry to pass the package as it will increase the tenure of the Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP), Qazi Faez Isa, who is perceived to be close to the ruling coalition. What added to the speculation is that on October 2, the Pakistan Supreme Court struck down its 2022 verdict, barring the legislators from voting against the party line, which would de-seat the legislator and force him/her to seek re-election while interpreting Article 63-A of the Constitution. Through an ordinance last month, the government already gave the CJP the power to reconstitute the Practice and Procedures Committee. The Special Bench constituted to hear the constitutional petition to review the verdict was not attended by Munib Akhtar, who protested and reclused himself from the Bench and Justice Mansoor Ali Shah, who was critical of the ordinance.This ordinance is perceived to help CJP Isa constitute a favourable bench so that the PML-N government can pass the constitutional package that has already been delayed due to a lack of 224 seats (two-thirds majority) in the Parliament, even though the government attributed the delay to ‘strategic reasons’. It is still working to reach a consensus but, at the same time, trying to encourage legislators from other political parties to defy their party instructions and vote in favour of this constitutional package. The PML-N has 75 directly elected seats, along with its coalition partners, the Pakistan People’s Party (PPP), which has 54 seats, and the Muttahida Qaumi Movement (MQM), which has 17 seats in the 266 directly elected seats in the National Assembly.Power configurationIt is a known fact that the Army has a stake in Pakistani politics, and many think that it played a role in putting together the present coalition to politically marginalise Imran Khan’s Pakistan Tehreek Insaf (PTI) that, despite all hurdles, performed spectacularly in the February election. Six months after this general election, the 70 reserved seats for women and minorities have not been distributed to the political parties based on proportional votes. The Supreme Court of Pakistan gave a verdict on July 12, saying that those PTI members who won the election as independents can claim the reserved seats as PTI seats. They do not need to join the Sunni Ittehad Council (SIC)—a party that could not even get one seat in the last election—to claim reserved seats. The Election Commission is yet to allot seats to the PTI despite the court’s threat of a contempt trial against it. After the reserved seats are allotted, the new seat arithmetic will not change the power configuration but bolster the PTI’s political presence.Interestingly, the government's proposed constitutional package was shrouded in secrecy, giving rise to speculation about its intent and urgency. The government defended its stance, saying the amendment has already been discussed in the Parliamentary Committee. It only relented when the JUI-F insisted on it in return for its support on September 14. According to media reports, some of the contents include establishing a constitutional court to unburden the Supreme Court, which devotes much of its time to deciding constitutional issues. According to the government, 60,000 cases are pending before the Supreme Court, of which 25 percent are constitutional petitions. For nearly a decade, Pakistan’s judiciary, including the Supreme Court, has emerged as a political battlefield for the political parties, the Army and the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI). The Supreme Court has also been divided over the constitutional propriety of essentially what are political issues. Unsurprisingly, there is a strong perception that the government wants to extend the tenure of Chief Justice Faez Isa, who is retiring on October 25. Justice Mansoor Ali Shah is going to be the next CJP.Issue of reserved seatOn July 12, the Supreme Court of Pakistan directed the Election Commission to distribute the reserved seats to the Pakistan Tehreek Insaf legislators who contested as independents. The court asked the party to submit the list of candidates for the reserved seats and also asked the PTI-linked independents to submit affidavits stating their allegiance to the party. In the intra-party elections case of January 13, 2024, the Supreme Court gave a verdict that the PTI cannot retain its election symbol as it failed to hold an intra-party election, forcing its candidates to contest the election as independents. While a decision was made earlier that the PTI independents would join the SIC to claim these seats, after the Supreme Court’s decision, the party applied for the allocation of reserved seats. The Election Commission of Pakistan said it would implement the SC’s order, but it held several meetings and could not arrive at a decision, further delaying the allotment. In July, it notified only 39 candidates from other political parties but not from the PTI. It said it does not have a valid organisational structure and does not know whom to approach to verify the PTI's nominated candidates for the reserved seats. After the intra-party election verdict, the ECP did not recognise the structure of the PTI. To nullify the SC verdict on the allocation of reserved seats, the Parliament passed The Election (2nd Amendment) Bill 2024, seeking amendments to sections 66 and 104. This means if the candidate has not affirmed his affiliation to the political party with the returning officer at the time of being granted an election symbol, it cannot have a claim to reserved seats based on proportional representation. After the amendment, it again sought the SC’s clarification on September 25. The Supreme Court passed strictures on the EC, saying the ECP’s action “significantly infringe upon the rights of the electorate and corrode their own institutional legitimacy.” While the reserved seat allocation remains unsettled for political reasons, the future of constitutional reform packages remains lingering. The JUI-F and PTI have announced that they will thrash out a draft constitutional package on their own. Meanwhile, CJP’s Isa has announced that he is not interested in extending his tenure and will retire on the due date. Yet, in Pakistan’s evolving politics, where the military continues to play a dominant role, the final curtain on the package is yet to be drawn. \nNepalis with disabilities face the daily ordeal of navigating cities that are not built for them. Whenever roads and sidewalks are built or expanded, the disabled community harbours hope of easier mobility. However, the authorities either overlook the accessibility for such people or carelessly build structures that are supposed to assist them. This renders people not only disabled by their conditions but also by infrastructural shortcomings. According to the National Census 2021, 2.2 percent of Nepal’s population has some form of disability; 2.5 percent of males and 2 percent of females have a disability. The country ratified the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities in December 2009. Moreover, the provisions in the Disability Rights Act ensure accessibility to physical infrastructure. Although Nepal has a progressive policy on the rights of people with disabilities, the implementation part has been lagging. An audit published by the National Federation of the Disabled-Nepal on 150 public infrastructure sites in Kathmandu showed that no samples were completely accessible: 132 samples were found “not accessible”, while the rest were “partially accessible”. In 2021, the Department of Roads allocated Rs 50 million for disabled-friendly pavements and even completed the first phase, a 1.5km stretch from Putalisadak to Thapathali. Although this is commendable, these supposedly disabled-friendly pavements need routine monitoring, as most of the tactile pavings built earlier ended abruptly or led to electricity poles, trees, walls or drains. Generalising disabilities and offering solutions that only cater to a specific group is also problematic. Most of the time, the authorities build tactile paving and label the area disability-friendly. However, problems of people with other forms of physical and intellectual disability—such as lack of tactile or audio indicators at zebra crossings, narrow sidewalks and absence of ramps—remain unaddressed.Although road accidents occasionally make headlines, accidents involving people with disabilities rarely get noticed. Many unreported cases involve people with disabilities falling into rivers or drains, collisions with poles or trees due to ineffective tactile blocks, and hit-and-run cases while crossing roads. These accidents can be avoided if basic assistance like railings, ramps, audio and tactile indicators, etc are ensured. In many instances, these problems arise not from the lack of disability-friendly infrastructures but from the general mismanagement and poor condition of public infrastructures. Potholes are a common sight on older roads and even some newer ones in Kathmandu. With the city’s rapid urbanisation, construction is happening every few metres. Building materials are often placed on sidewalks that are already narrow, leaving pedestrians with no choice but to walk on the roads. This poses a risk for everyone and could be perilous for people with disabilities. Moreover, the roads that seem perfectly fine the previous day are under maintenance the next day. The authorities do not consider providing an alternative disability-friendly route. Even the signs that inform of the situation of the roads ahead are ineffective. Doing the bare minimum to check the inclusivity list is not an option. Many government office buildings in Nepal are not disability-friendly, and the same applies to institutions like schools and universities. This is also due to the lack of proper budget, as disabled-friendly infrastructures are often not prioritised, depriving a significant and capable portion of the population of their fundamental rights. The government must ensure that people with disabilities have the rights that are promised in the constitution. As for our part as citizens, we must abandon our primitive mindset and be more inclusive of people with disabilities in our thoughts and actions. It’s time we realise that an inclusive nation leaves no one behind as it progresses.  \nFollowing two weeks of rain-induced disasters, disaster-hit communities still await rescue and relief, prompting the government to declare disaster crisis zones in affected areas, but concerns remain due to past failures and current challenges like isolation, inaccessibility, and ineffective government response and coordination.\nDecades-old landlessness persists in Nepal, disproportionately affecting women, Dalits, and ethnic groups, despite recent government efforts to resolve it.\nDevastating floods and landslides in Nepal caused 244 deaths, highlighting the need for enhanced disaster preparedness, risk assessment, and responsive land use planning in the face of extreme weather events influenced by climate change.\nDespite IMF and ADB projections of economic improvement, Nepal's economy faces challenges due to slow growth, declining capital formation, policy hurdles, and vulnerability to external factors such as remittance, tourism, and energy exports.\nParliamentary committee investigating cooperative scam finds Rabi Lamichhane and associates responsible for misusing funds, with the government implementing the report despite ongoing debate over Lamichhane's involvement.\nNepal debates amending its Constitution, with experts emphasizing the need for a broad consensus, expert review, and a focus on addressing the effectiveness of the three-tier federal system, executive head elections, and the division of powers between local, provincial, and federal governments.\nThe weather on Wednesday is forecast to be partly to generally cloudy in the hilly areas, while the rest of the country will remain mostly fair.
